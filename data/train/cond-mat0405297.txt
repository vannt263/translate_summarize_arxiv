    "the synchronization of coupled nonlinear oscillators has been a fertile area of research for decades@xcite . in particular ,",
    "phase models of the winfree type@xcite have been extensively studied . in one dimension ,",
    "a generic version of this model for @xmath0 oscillators is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the phase of oscillator @xmath3 , which can be envisioned as a point moving around the unit circle with angular velocity @xmath4 . in the absence of coupling , this overdamped oscillator has an angular velocity @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the coupling function , and @xmath7 describes the range and nature ( _ e.g. _ attractive or repulsive ) of the coupling .",
    "the special case @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 constant ) , corresponds to the uniform , sinusoidal coupling of each oscillator to the remaining @xmath11 oscillators .",
    "this mean - field system is usually called the ( globally - coupled ) kuramoto model ( gkm ) .",
    "kuramoto was the first to show that for this particular form of coupling and in the @xmath12 limit , there is a continuous dynamical phase transition at a critical value of the coupling strength @xmath13 and that for @xmath14 both phase and frequency synchronization appear in the system@xcite . if @xmath15 while the coupling function retains the form @xmath16 we have the so - called locally - coupled kuramoto model ( lkm ) , in which each oscillator is coupled only to its nearest neighbors . studies of synchronization in the lkm@xcite , including extensions to more than one spatial dimension , have shown that @xmath13 grows without bound in the @xmath12 limit@xcite .",
    "several years ago , watts and strogatz introduced a simple model for tuning collections of coupled dynamical systems between the two extremes of random and regular networks@xcite . in this model ,",
    "connections between nodes in a regular array are randomly rewired with a probability @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 means the network is regularly connected , while @xmath19 results in a random connection of nodes . for a range of intermediate values of @xmath17 between these two extremes ,",
    "the network retains a property of regular networks ( a large clustering coefficient ) and also acquires a property of random networks ( a short characteristic path length between nodes ) .",
    "networks in this intermediate configuration are termed `` small - world '' networks .",
    "many examples of such small worlds , both natural and human - made , have been discussed@xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , there has been much interest in the synchronization of dynamical systems connected in a small - world geometry@xcite .",
    "generically , such studies have shown that the presence of small - world connections make it easier for a network to synchronize , an effect generally attributed to the reduced path length between the linked systems .",
    "this has also been found to be true for the special case in which the dynamics of each oscillator is described by a kuramoto model@xcite .    as an example of physically - controllable systems of nonlinear oscillators which can be studied both theoretically and experimentally , josephson junction ( jj ) arrays are almost without peer . through modern fabrication techniques and careful experimental methods",
    "one can attain a high degree of control over the dynamics of a jj array , and many detailed aspects of array behavior have been studied@xcite . among the many different geometries of jj arrays , _ ladder _ arrays ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] ) deserve special attention .",
    "for example , they have been observed to support stable time - dependent , spatially - localized states known as discrete breathers@xcite .",
    "in addition , the ladder geometry is more complex than that of better understood serial arrays but less so than fully two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays .",
    "in fact , a ladder can be considered as a special kind of 2d array , and so the study of ladders could throw some light on the behavior of such 2d arrays . also",
    ", linearly - stable synchronization of the horizontal , or rung , junctions in a ladder ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] ) is observed in the absence of a load over a wide range of dc bias currents and junction parameters ( such as junction capacitance ) , so that synchronization in this geometry appears to be robust@xcite .    in the mid 1990 s",
    "it was shown that a _ serial _ array of zero - capacitance , _",
    "i.e. _ overdamped , junctions coupled to a load could be mapped onto the gkm@xcite .",
    "the load in this case was essential in providing an all - to - all coupling among the junctions .",
    "the result was based on an averaging process , in which ( at least ) two distinct time scales were identified : the `` short '' time scale set by the rapid voltage oscillations of the junctions ( the array was current biased above its critical current ) and `` long '' time scale over which the junctions synchronize their voltages . if the resistively - shunted junction ( rsj ) equations describing the dynamics of the junctions are integrated over one cycle of the `` short '' time scale , what remains is the `` slow '' dynamics , describing the synchronization of the array .",
    "this mapping is useful because it allows knowledge about the gkm to be applied to understanding the dynamics of the serial jj array .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were able , based on the gkm , to predict the level of critical current disorder the array could tolerate before frequency synchronization would be lost .",
    "frequency synchronization , also described as entrainment , refers to the state of the array in which all junctions _ not _ in the zero - voltage state have equal ( to within some numerical precision ) time - averaged voltages : @xmath20 , where @xmath2 is the gauge - invariant phase difference across junction @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , the `` slow '' synchronization dynamics of finite - capacitance serial arrays of jj s has also been studied@xcite .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , however , no experimental work on jj arrays has verified the accuracy of this gkm mapping . instead , the first detailed experimental verification of kuramoto s theory was recently performed on systems of coupled electrochemical oscillators@xcite .",
    "recently , daniels et al.@xcite , with an eye toward a better understanding of synchronization in 2d jj arrays , showed that a ladder array of _ overdamped _ junctions could be mapped onto the locally - coupled kuramoto model ( lkm ) .",
    "this work was based on an averaging process , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was valid in the limits of weak critical current disorder ( less than about @xmath21 ) and large dc bias currents , @xmath22 , along the rung junctions ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the arithmetic average of the critical currents of the rung junctions .",
    "the result demonstrated , for both open and periodic boundary conditions , that synchronization of the current - biased rung junctions in the ladder is well described by eq .",
    "[ eq : winfree ] .",
    "the goal of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we will demonstrate that a ladder array of _ underdamped _ junctions can be mapped onto a second - order winfree - type oscillator model of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant related to the average capacitance of the rung junctions .",
    "this result is based on the resistively and capacitively - shunted junction ( rcsj ) model and a multiple time scale analysis of the classical equations for the array .",
    "secondly , we study the effects of small world ( sw ) connections on the synchronization of both overdamped and underdamped ladder arrays .",
    "we will demonstrate that sw connections make it easier for the ladder to synchronize , and that a kuramoto or winfree type model ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : winfree ] and  [ eq : winfree2 ] ) , suitably generalized to include the new connections , accurately describes the synchronization of this ladder .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "[ sec : twotiming ] and  [ sec : results ] we discuss the multiple time - scale technique for deriving the coupled phase oscillator model for the _ underdamped _ ladder _ without _ sw connections .",
    "we compare the synchronization of this `` averaged '' model to the exact rcsj behavior .",
    "we also analyze how the array s synchronization depends on the capacitance of the junctions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sw ] , we study the effects of sw connections , or shortcuts , on the synchronization of both overdamped and underdamped ladders . in our scenario , each sw connection is actually another josephson junction .",
    "we generalize our phase - oscillator model to include the effects of shortcuts and relate our results to earlier work on kuramoto - like models in the presence of shortcuts@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] we study the effects of sw connections on synchronization in disordered 2d arrays . here",
    "we find that the disordered 2d array , which does _ not _ fully synchronize in the pristine case ( _ i.e. _ in the absence of shortcuts ) , is only weakly synchronized by the addition of shortcut junctions between superconducting islands in the array . in sec .",

    "secondly , the lkm2 is solved more quickly on the computer and is easier to understand intuitively than the rcsj equations .",
    "future work in this area could include using the results of this mapping for the underdamped ladder ( as well as the first - order lkm for the overdamped ladder ) to arrive at a phase model for the 2d array , as has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . such a phase model for 2d arrays may shed light on why it is difficult for 2d arrays to synchronize .",
    "we have also shown that small - world connections enhance a ladder array s ability to synchronize .",
    "this result is not surprising in light of our mapping to the lkm and earlier studies in which the lkm was found to exhibit a mean - field like phase synchronization transition in the presence of shortcuts@xcite .",
    "but we find that sw connections only marginally increase the ability of a 2d array to synchronize .",
    "specifically , for several representative 2d small - world networks , we found only some small fraction of these networks had slightly improved frequency synchronization of the horizontal junctions . in the pristine 2d array ( @xmath18 )",

    "future work in this area could include looking at a broader range of @xmath17 values as well as looking at larger 2d arrays .",

    "one source of this temptation is the intriguing fact that the pristine 2d array of disordered junctions will form synchronized clusters consisting of individual ladders .",
    "another is our result that shortcuts can augment synchronization in individual ladders but not in 2d arrays . if one can produce a mapping , even approximate , of the rcsj equations for the 2d array to a phase model of the winfree type",

    "<S> we study synchronization in disordered arrays of josephson junctions . in the first half of the paper , we consider the relation between the coupled resistively- and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) equations for such arrays and effective phase models of the winfree type . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a multiple - time scale analysis of the rcsj equations for a ladder array of junctions _ with non - negligible capacitance _ in which we arrive at a second order phase model that captures well the synchronization physics of the rcsj equations for that geometry . in the second half of the paper , motivated by recent work on small world networks , we study the effect on synchronization of random , long - range connections between pairs of junctions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the effects of such shortcuts on ladder arrays , finding that the shortcuts make it easier for the array of junctions in the nonzero voltage state to synchronize . in 2d arrays </S>",
    "<S> we find that the additional shortcut junctions are only marginally effective at inducing synchronization of the active junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in the effects of shortcut junctions in 1d and 2d can be partly understood in terms of an effective phase model . </S>"
