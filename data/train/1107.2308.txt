    "neutrino flavor oscillations in a supernova ( sn ) are strongly suppressed by matter effects  @xcite until the neutrinos pass through the usual msw region  @xcite far out in the envelope of the collapsing star . however , neutrino - neutrino interactions  @xcite , through a flavor off - diagonal refractive index , can trigger self - induced flavor conversions  @xcite .",
    "this collective effect tends to occur between the neutrino sphere and the msw region and can lead to strongly modified neutrino spectra , showing features such as spectral swaps and splits  @xcite ; for a review see ref .",
    "the overall scenario , supported by heuristic arguments and numerical examples , is that deep inside the sn core , the system performs `` synchronized oscillations '' with an extremely small amplitude , i.e.  every neutrino remains essentially stuck in its initial flavor eigenstate . as the neutrinos stream outwards , there is a sharp onset radius where `` bimodal '' oscillations begin : some ranges of modes start pendulum - like oscillations  @xcite , exchanging their flavor content with each other without affecting the flavor content of the overall system .",
    "this scenario engenders a crucial simplification for the treatment of neutrino transport in sn simulations . at high densities , where neutrinos collide frequently ,",
    "it is enough to solve the transport equations for each flavor separately , ignoring oscillations entirely . on the other hand , flavor conversions at larger distances",
    "can be treated ignoring neutrino collisions and absorption , i.e.  as a pure propagation problem . so collisions and flavor oscillations are phenomena that are assumed to be taking place in different regions of the star and can be treated independently .",
    "when the radial distance where bimodal oscillations begin is far away from the sn core , this assumption is valid and the flavor conversions do not affect the sn dynamics .",
    "recent studies dedicated to the sn accretion phase , under simplifying assumptions , once more confirm this picture  @xcite .",
    "however , what is missing is a systematic approach to decide , without solving the equations of motion , if self - induced flavor conversions occur for given neutrino spectra ( flavor - dependent energy and angular distribution ) , overall neutrino density , and matter density .",
    "formal stability criteria exist only in the `` single - angle approximation '' where it is assumed that all neutrinos feel the same neutrino - neutrino refractive effect . in this case",
    "the analytic pendulum solution has been found and its existence and parameters can be calculated from the neutrino spectrum and density alone  @xcite .    on the other hand , the current - current nature of the low - energy weak - interaction hamiltonian implies that neutrinos in the background of an anisotropic neutrino flux experience a refractive effect that strongly depends on direction .",
    "for some energy spectra , these `` multi - angle effects '' have little impact , whereas in other cases they completely change the solution .",
    "a sn neutrino flux with a vanishing net @xmath0 flux is unstable everywhere and shows quick multi - angle decoherence  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0 flux is large enough , this effect is avoided if the energy spectrum is simple  @xcite .",
    "more complicated spectra can be unstable even for a large @xmath0 flux at any density in the single - angle case , but the instability is suppressed by multi - angle effects  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of ordinary matter causes a multi - angle suppression of the bimodal instability  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was claimed that for nontrivial angular distributions , as may exist when different flavors are emitted from very different neutrino spheres , there is a novel multi - angle instability  @xcite .",
    "deviations from the usually assumed cylindrical symmetry may also have an important influence  @xcite .",
    "although our problem is nonlinear and therefore would seem intractable , noting that an instability must occur in order for the onset to take place leads to a surprising simplification . in the dense sn matter",
    "well inside of the msw region , the matter effect is so large that neutrino propagation eigenstates are essentially identical with flavor eigenstates .",
    "this means that in the weak - interaction basis , the flavor matrices of occupation numbers are almost perfectly diagonal , allowing us to linearize the equations of motion ( eoms ) in terms of the small off - diagonal elements .",
    "an instability is equivalent to some of these small elements starting to grow exponentially .",
    "all we need to do is linearize the eoms , perform a fourier analysis , and seek exponentially growing solutions of the relevant eigenvalue equation .",
    "this is simple even in the multi - angle situation .",
    "almost certainly this approach can be extended to cases without the usually assumed cylindrical symmetry around the radial direction .    studying",
    "the stability of a strongly coupled and nonlinear system in the small - amplitude limit is a standard technique . in the present context",
    "it was put forth in ref .",
    "however , the method was carried only to schematic cases of a small number of neutrino momentum modes , leaving open how to apply it to realistic situations .",
    "while a stability analysis provides crucial insight , we stress that it alone is not enough to assess the impact in the sn context",
    ". only a small range of modes may participate in the bimodal oscillation or the growth rate may be too small on the available time scale .",
    "( of course , both the growth rate and the location of the resonance on the energy - angle spectrum are found by solving the eigenvalue equation . ) for example , the classic single - angle case with an initial fermi - dirac spectrum of only @xmath0 and @xmath1 is always unstable and the usual concept of a synchronization radius does not apply .",
    "however , for large neutrino densities , the growth rate is small and only a narrow range of infrared modes is affected .",
    "a `` visible '' effect arises only at a quasi - onset radius where the growth rate begins to compete with the overall evolution time scale and the resonance begins to move into the main part of the spectrum",
    ". we will here largely avoid such issues and concentrate on setting up the method and discussing simple but informative schematic cases . applying this method in a realistic sn context",
    "will be left to future work .",

    "one uses positive occupation numbers in both cases and describe each mode by its momentum @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "our choice of signs , however , allows us to include neutrinos and antineutrinos on the same footing and we will never have to distinguish between them : the antineutrino spectrum is simply a continuation of the neutrino spectrum to negative energies . in the language of flavor polarization vectors , our convention agrees with the neutrino flavor isospin construction  @xcite .",

    ", the stability in normal hierarchy for sufficiently large @xmath273 looks like yet another case of multi - angle suppression of an instability .",
    "the refractive effect of neutrino - neutrino interactions can cause a flavor instability among the different energy and angular modes , exchanging the flavor content while leaving unchanged the overall flavor content of the entire ensemble . in the context of sn neutrinos ,",
    "the focus so far has been on impacts of collective flavor oscillations on the neutrino signal of the next nearby sn or for the r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "many analyses have been performed under the simplifying assumption that all neutrinos feel the same refractive effect due to the other neutrinos ( single - angle assumption ) .",
    "however it has also been found that multi - angle effects can strongly modify the answer and can typically suppress flavor conversions that would occur in the single - angle treatment . in this sense , a more pressing question is to understand the stability conditions for a dense neutrino stream , and to understand if the usual neglect of flavor oscillations in those dense sn regions is justified where a boltzmann treatment of neutrino transport is necessary .",
    "we have studied the conditions under which instabilities can occur in the neutrino stream in the two - flavor framework . while the equations of motion are nonlinear , the run - away solutions can be found by a standard mode analysis of the linearized system , i.e.  in the small - amplitude expansion .",
    "we have shown how the stability question is reduced to a straightforward eigenvalue equation in the co - rotating frame .",
    "the existence of complex eigenvalues directly corresponds to an instability . in the multi - angle case , besides the small - amplitude expansion , we have linearized the equations in the small angular divergence of the neutrino flux that is applicable at a large distance from the source . in the single - angle case ,",
    "our conditions agree with the previous literature , whereas in the multi - angle case , our results are new .    in the single - angle case and using schematic energy spectra ( box spectra in the @xmath50 variable ) , the eigenvalue equation can be solved analytically .",
    "we identify two generic instability cases . the `` cutoff mode '' exists for a finite range of neutrino densities , or equivalently , a finite interval of effective neutrino - neutrino interaction strengths @xmath330 .",
    "in particular , the system is stable above a cutoff value @xmath331 , also termed the `` synchronization '' or `` sleeping top '' regime .",
    "this behavior is generic to a single - crossed ( or two - box ) spectrum and represents the traditional flavor pendulum . on the other hand",
    ", there is the `` saturation mode '' where the instability approaches an asymptotic value for large @xmath137 .",
    "this mode requires at least two crossings ( three boxes ) and had been previously found in the literature .",
    "when it exists , the saturation mode exists for both hierarchies . for multi - crossed spectra ,",
    "several modes can co - exist , for example in the four - box case a saturation mode and a cutoff mode or two cutoff modes .",
    "an additional case occurs for neutrino spectra with a vanishing asymmetry , i.e.  with no net lepton number flux .",
    "the run - away rate @xmath123 grows indefinitely as a function of @xmath137 .",
    "this actually is a special case of the cutoff mode ( cutoff at infinite @xmath137 ) and does not seem to be of practical interest in the sn context .",
    "realistic neutrino spectra are not described by boxes and have tails as a function of @xmath49 , corresponding to infrared energies .",
    "such spectra do not have a cutoff and a synchronization regime does not exist .",
    "however , for large @xmath137 the instability moves entirely into the infrared regime and has no practical impact .",
    "there remains an effective cutoff density where the amount of flavor exchange between modes drops by orders of magnitude within a narrow range of neutrino densities .",
    "still , the existence of a synchronization regime is only an approximate concept .",
    "multi - angle effects modify the instability in several ways .",
    "for example , while the single - angle approximation predicts an instability only if there is a positive zero - crossing of the spectrum @xmath124 , the multi - angle analysis implies that spectra with a small asymmetry ( a small net lepton number flux ) and in the absence of matter are unstable in both hierarchies , whatever be the sign of the zero - crossing .",
    "the solutions for both hierarchies can be mapped onto each other .",
    "the main multi - angle modification of the instability is caused by a background of matter , where here neutrinos themselves also contribute to the matter effect .",
    "the saturation mode is `` fragile '' and , for box spectra , develops a cutoff .",
    "( for realistic spectra with tails , there is no exact cutoff , however , as mentioned earlier . )",
    "the neutrino background alone is enough to achieve this effect .    for both the saturation and cutoff modes , a large matter effect shifts the domain of instability @xmath330 to larger values of @xmath137 .",
    "the amount of shift is approximately equal to the matter potential @xmath260 , apparently without reducing the typical @xmath123 values within the instability domain .",
    "an additional consequence is that the affected range of modes shrinks for increasing @xmath260 .",
    "even if the run - away scale @xmath123 is not reduced , only a narrow range of angular modes is on resonance if @xmath260 is large .",
    "for realistic spectra with tails , @xmath144 does not vanish for large @xmath137 , i.e.  there is not an exact cutoff . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a lower threshold @xmath332 below which the spectrum is completely stable . in other words ,",
    "multi - angle effects introduce a range @xmath333 where the spectrum is stable even when such a stable range does not exist in the single - angle approximation .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the multi - angle suppression of instability at @xmath334 , which we motivate analytically through our linearized treatment .",
    "one may further investigate these findings in the context of realistic sn situations where neutrinos stream from regions of large density to vacuum , sweeping through @xmath137 values from very large to zero .",
    "the central frequency @xmath117 of the instability then sweeps through different spectral ranges and the growth rate @xmath123 depends on both the neutrino and matter density .",
    "effective flavor conversion can be suppressed in different ways : the growth rate @xmath123 can vanish when @xmath137 falls into the multi - angle - implied stability domain , or it can be too small on the available distance scale , or the instability can be located mostly in the infrared and affect only an ignorable part of the spectrum .",
    "we have considered neutrinos streaming from a source and have made the approximation of small angular divergence that is appropriate at a large distance from the source .",
    "our approach can be easily adapted to a homogeneous ensemble with a nontrivial angular distribution that evolves in time rather than as a function of distance from a source . in this case",
    "no expansion in the angular variable is needed .",
    "we have only considered trivial angular distributions where all neutrino flavors are assumed to be emitted from a common blackbody sphere without limb darkening , corresponding to a box spectrum in our @xmath25 variable .",
    "one can extend our analysis to more complicated angular distributions that could involve , for example , spectral crossings in the angular variable . as advocated by sawyer ,",
    "such crossings cause a `` multi - angle instability , '' but its practical relevance remains to be investigated .",
    "we have made the usual assumption of azimuthal symmetry of the neutrino flux around the radial direction away from the source . in the long - distance limit of small angular divergence of the neutrino field ,",
    "one can of course expand the eoms in terms of small variables that depend on two angles .",
    "it remains to be explored if cylindrical symmetry enforces unphysical solutions , just as the single - angle approximation sometimes enforces unphysical solutions , and if there are new instabilities or important modifications that could be relevant in the sn context .",
    "based on schematic models using a small number of modes it has been suggested that violations of cylindrical symmetry could have a major impact  @xcite .    a rich phenomenology of neutrino flavor conversions is bound to emerge from further investigations into the collective effects due to neutrino - neutrino interactions and ordinary matter background , in the complete multi - angle framework .",

    "<S> neutrino - neutrino interactions in dense neutrino streams , like those emitted by a core - collapse supernova , can lead to self - induced neutrino flavor conversions . </S>",
    "<S> while this is a nonlinear phenomenon , the onset of these conversions can be examined through a standard stability analysis of the linearized equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is reduced to a linear eigenvalue equation that involves the neutrino density , energy spectrum , angular distribution , and matter density . in the single - angle case , </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce previous results and use them to identify two generic instabilities : the system is stable above a cutoff density ( `` cutoff mode '' ) , or can approach an asymptotic instability for increasing density ( `` saturation mode '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze multi - angle effects on these generic types of instabilities and find that even the saturation mode is suppressed at large densities . for both types of modes , </S>",
    "<S> a given multi - angle spectrum typically is unstable when the neutrino and electron densities are comparable , but stable when the neutrino density is much smaller or much larger than the electron density . </S>",
    "<S> the role of an instability in the sn context depends on the available growth time and on the range of affected modes . at large matter density , most modes are off - resonance even when the system is unstable . </S>"
