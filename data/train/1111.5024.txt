    "the study of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of black holes is an old and well established subject , where the various frequencies are indicative of both the parameters of the black hole and the type of emissions possible .",
    "initially the calculation of these frequencies was done in a purely numerical way , which requires selecting a value for the complex frequency , integrating the differential equation , and checking whether the boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "note that in the following we shall use the definition that qnms are defined as solutions of the perturbed field equations with boundary conditions : @xmath2 for an @xmath3 time dependence ( which corresponds to ingoing waves at the horizon and outgoing waves at infinity ) .",
    "also note the boundary condition as @xmath4 does not apply to asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes , where instead something like a dirichlet boundary condition is imposed , for example see ref .",
    "since those conditions are not satisfied in general , the complex frequency plane must be surveyed for discrete values that lead to qnms .",
    "this technique is time consuming and cumbersome , making it difficult to systematically survey the qnms for a wide range of parameter values . following early work by vishveshwara @xcite , chandrasekhar and",
    "detweiler @xcite pioneered this method for studying qnms .    in order to improve on this ,",
    "a few semi - analytic analyses were also attempted . in one approach , employed by mashoon _",
    "@xcite , the potential barrier in the effective one - dimensional schrdinger equation is replaced by a parameterized analytic potential barrier function for which simple exact solutions are known .",
    "the overall shape approximates that of the true black hole barrier , and the parameters of the barrier function are adjusted to fit the height and curvature of the true barrier at the peak .",
    "the resulting estimates for the qnm frequencies have been applied to the schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes , with agreement within a few percent with the numerical results of chandrasekhar and detweiler in the schwarzschild case @xcite , and with gunter @xcite in the reissner - nordstrm case . however , as this method relies upon a specialized barrier function , there is no systematic way to estimate the errors or to improve the accuracy .",
    "the method by leaver @xcite , which is a hybrid of the analytic and the numerical , successfully generates qnm frequencies by making use of an analytic infinite - series representation of the solutions , together with a numerical solution of an equation for the qnm frequencies which involves , typically by applying a frobenius series solution approach , the use of continued fractions .",
    "this technique is known as the continued fraction method ( cfm ) .",
    "historically , another commonly applied technique is the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "even though it is based on an approximation , this approach is powerful as the wkb approximation is known in many cases to be more accurate , and can be carried to higher orders , either as a means to improve accuracy or as a means to estimate the errors explicitly .",
    "also it allows a more systematic study of qnms than has been possible using outright numerical methods .",
    "the wkb approximation has since been extended to sixth - order @xcite .",
    "however , all of these approaches have their limitations , where in recent years a new method has been developed which can be more efficient in some cases , called the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) . previously this method was used to solve eigenvalue problems @xcite as a semi - analytic technique for solving second - order homogeneous linear differential equations .",
    "it has also been successfully shown by some of the current authors that the aim is an efficient and accurate technique for calculating qnms @xcite .",
    "as such , we will review the aim as applied to a variety of black hole spacetimes , making ( where possible ) comparisons with the results calculated by the wkb method and the cfm  la leaver @xcite .",
    "therefore , the structure of this paper shall be : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we shall review the aim and the improved method of ciftci _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , along with a discussion of how the qnm boundary conditions are ensured .",
    "applications to simple concrete examples , such as the harmonic oscillator and the poschl - teller potential are also provided . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] the case of schwarzschild ( a)ds black holes shall be discussed , developing the integer and half - spin equations . in sec .",

    "[ sec:6 ] will discuss the spin - zero qnms for doubly rotating black holes .",
    "we then summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec:7 ] .",
    "to begin we shall now review the idea behind the aim , where we first consider the homogeneous linear second - order differential equation for the function @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions in @xmath10 . in order to find a general solution to this equation",
    ", we rely on the symmetric structure of the right - hand of eq .",

( [ eqn:2 - 2 ] ) and the definition of @xmath31 have been used . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : chapter 4 equation 15 ] ) , we obtain the first - order differential equation @xmath32 which leads to the general solution @xmath33 \\left ( c_2 + c_1 \\int^x \\exp \\left \\ { \\int^{x ' } \\left [ \\lambda_0 ( x '' ) + 2 \\beta ( x '' ) \\right ] dx '' \\right\\ } dx ' \\right ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] the integration constants , @xmath30 and @xmath34 , can be determined by an appropriate choice of normalisation .",
    "note , that for the generation of exact solutions @xmath35 .",
    "ciftci _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were among the first to note that an unappealing feature of the recursion relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn:2 - 2 ] ) is that at each iteration one must take the derivative of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 terms of the previous iteration .",
    "this can slow the numerical implementation of the aim down considerably and also lead to problems with numerical precision .    to circumvent these issues we developed an improved version of the aim which bypasses the need to take derivatives at each step @xcite .",
    "this greatly improves both the accuracy and speed of the method .",
    "we expand the @xmath38 and @xmath39 in a taylor series around the point at which the aim is performed , @xmath40 : @xmath41 where the @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the @xmath44 taylor coefficient s of @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . substituting these expressions into eqs . ( [ eqn:2 - 2 ] ) leads to a set of recursion relations for the coefficients : @xmath47 in terms of these coefficients the `` quantization condition '' eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quantcond ] ) can be re - expressed as @xmath48 and thus we have reduced the aim into a set of recursion relations which no longer require derivative operators .    observing that the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : coeffiterlam ] ) and ( [ eqn : coeffiters ] ) involve terms of order at most @xmath49 , one can recurse these equations until only @xmath50 and @xmath51 terms remain ( that is , the coefficients of @xmath52 and @xmath53 only ) .",
    "however , for large numbers of iterations , due to the large number of terms , such expressions become impractical to compute .",
    "we avert this combinatorial problem by beginning at the @xmath54 stage and calculating the @xmath55 coefficients sequentially until the desired number of recursions is reached . since the quantisation condition only requires the @xmath56 term , at each iteration @xmath20 we only need to determine coefficients with @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the maximum number of iterations to be performed .",
    "the qnms that we calculate in this paper will be determined using this improved aim .        in order to understand the effectiveness of the aim",
    ", it is appropriate to apply this method to a simple concrete problem : the harmonic oscillator potential in one dimension , @xmath59 when @xmath60 approaches infinity , the wave function @xmath61 must approach zero .",
    "asymptotically the function @xmath61 decays like a gaussian distribution , in which case we can write @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the new wave function . substituting eq .",
    "( [ harm2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ harm1 ] ) then re - arranging the equation and dividing by a common factor , one can obtain @xmath64 we recognise this as hermite s equation . for convenience we let @xmath65 , such that in our case @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we define @xmath68 thus using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn:2 - 2 ] ) one can find that @xmath69 and the termination condition eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quantcond ] ) can be written as @xmath70 .",
    "hence @xmath71 must be a non - negative integer , which means @xmath72 and this is the exact spectrum for such a potential .",
    "moreover , the wave function @xmath73 can also be derived in this method .",
    "we should point out that in this case the termination condition , @xmath70 , is dependent only on the eigenvalue @xmath71 for a given iteration number @xmath20 , and this is the reason why we can obtain an exact eigenvalue .",
    "however , for the black hole cases in subsequent sections , the termination condition depends also on @xmath11 , and therefore one can only obtain approximate eigenvalues by terminating the procedure after @xmath20 iterations .      to conclude this section we will also demonstrate that the aim can be applied to the case of qnms , which have unbounded ( scattering ) like potentials , by recalling that we can find qnms for scarf ii ( upside - down poschl - teller - like ) potentials @xcite .",
    "this is based on observations made by one of the current authors @xcite relating qnms from quasi - exactly solvable models .",
    "indeed bound state poschl - teller potentials have been used for qnm approximations previously by inverting black hole potentials @xcite .",
    "however , the aim does not require any inversion of the black hole potential as we shall show .",
    "starting with the potential term @xmath74 and the schrdinger equation , we obtain : @xmath75 as we shall also see in the following sections , it is more convenient to transform our coordinates to a finite domain . hence , we shall use the transformation @xmath76 , which leads to @xmath77 + \\left [ \\omega^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-y^2\\right)\\right ] \\psi & = & 0   \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( [ qnmdef ] ) can then be implemented as follows .",

    "hence our boundary condition @xmath81 . likewise , as @xmath82 we have @xmath83 and the boundary condition @xmath84 .",
    "as such we can take the boundary conditions into account by writing @xmath85 and therefore have @xmath86 where @xmath87 following the aim procedure , that is , taking @xmath88 successively for @xmath89 , one can obtain exact eigenvalues : @xmath90 this exact qnm spectrum is the same as the one in ref .",

    "the reader might wonder about approximate results for cases where poschl - teller approximations can be used , such as schwarzschild and sds backgrounds , e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in fact",
    "when the black hole potential can be modeled by a scarf like potential the aim can be used to find the eigenvalues exactly @xcite and hence the qnms numerically .",
    "we demonstrate this in the next section .",
