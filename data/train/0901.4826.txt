    "in this paper we carefully characterize in terms of its broken symmetries , a novel superconducting state of matter , the `` pair - density - wave '' ( pdw ) , with special focus on the `` striped superconductor '' , a unidirectional pdw .",
    "we present a concrete microscopic model of interacting electrons which we show , using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods , has a striped superconducting ground state .",
    "there is an intimate relation between pdw and charge density wave ( cdw ) order , as a consequence of which the striped superconductor exhibits an extreme sensitivity to quenched disorder which inevitably leads to glassy behavior .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the familiar effects of disorder in uniform superconductors .    on the experimental side , we first draw attention to a set of recently discovered transport anomalies in the high temperature superconductor , , which are particularly prominent for @xmath7",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the spectacular dynamical layer decoupling effects recently observed in this system @xcite which indicate that the effective inter - layer josephson coupling becomes vanishingly small with decreasing temperature .",
    "these experiments suggest that a special symmetry of the state is required to explain this previously unsuspected behavior .",
    "while no comprehensive theory of these observations currently exists , even at the phenomenological level , we show how the salient features of these observations can be straightforwardly rationalized under the assumption that la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is a striped superconductor .",
    "we outline some further experiments that could critically test this assumption .",
    "finally , we speculate about the possible role of striped superconducting order as the source of a number of salient experimental anomalies in a much broader spectrum of high temperature superconductors , including recent experiments on magnetic field induced layer decoupling in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite , the notable evidence of a local gap with many characteristics of a superconducting gap in stm and arpes experiments in bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath8 @xcite , and , most speculatively of all , experiments indicative of time reversal symmetry breaking in the pseudo - gap regime of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 .    the striped superconductor is a novel state of strongly correlated electronic matter in which the superconducting , charge and spin order parameters are closely intertwined with each other , rather than merely coexisting or competing .",
    "as we show here ( and discussed in @xcite ) the striped superconductor arises from the competing tendencies existing in a strongly correlated system , resulting in an inhomogeneous state in which all three forms of order are simultaneously present .",
    "the striped superconductor is thus a new type of electronic liquid crystal state @xcite . in particular , as we shall see , the symmetry breaking pattern of the striped superconductor naturally explains the spectacular layer decoupling effects observed in experiments in la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 . in contrast , in any state with uniform superconducting order , dynamical inter - layer decoupling could only arise if a somewhat unnatural fine tuning of the inter - layer couplings led to a sliding phase @xcite .",
    "the striped superconductor has an order parameter describing a paired state with non - vanishing wave vector , @xmath9 , the ordering wave vector of the unidirectional pdw .",
    "as such , this state is closely related by symmetry to the fulde - ferrell @xcite ( ff ) and larkin - ovchinnikov @xcite ( lo ) states .",
    "the order parameter structure of the pdw state , involving several order parameters coupled to each other , also evokes the @xmath10 approach of a unified description of antiferromagnetism and a uniform @xmath11-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "the relation of the present discussion to these other systems and to earlier theoretical works on the same and closely related subjects is deferred to sec .",
    "[ sec : history ] .",
    "the physics of stripe phases in the cuprate superconductors has been reviewed in ref.@xcite and more recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the macroscopically superconducting phase of the cuprates reflects the existence of a spatially uniform @xmath12 component of the order parameter , whether or not there is substantial finite range superconducting order at non - zero @xmath9 .",
    "one might therefore reasonably ask whether striped superconductivity , even if interesting in its own right , is anything but an exotic oddity , with little or no relation to the essential physics of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "the answer to this question is at present unclear , and will _ not _ be addressed to any great extent in the present paper .",
    "however , we wish to briefly speculate on a way in which the striped superconductor could play an essential role in the broader features of this problem . in bcs theory",
    ", the superconducting state emerges from a fermi liquid in which the strong electronic interactions are already accounted for in the self - energy of the quasiparticles .",
    "the cuprates are different , in that the superconductivity , especially in underdoped materials , emerges from a pseudogap phase for which there is no commonly accepted model . as we will show , striped superconductivity has features in common with the pseudogap phase , such as a gapless nodal arc and antinodal gaps .",
    "we speculate that the pseudogap phase might be associated with fluctuating striped superconductivity , a state that we do not yet know how to treat .",
    "nevertheless , analysis of the ordered pdw state and comparison to observations of stripe - ordered cuprates is a starting point .",
    "indeed , comparison ( see subsection [ subsec : lbco ] ) of recent photoemission results on lbco x=1/8 with transport and optical properties suggests that a `` uniform '' d - wave state ( _ i.e. _ one with a non - zero uniform component of the order parameter ) develops on top of a striped superconductor , resulting in a fully superconducting meissner state , albeit one with substantial coexisting short - range correlated stripe order .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : order ] we give an order parameter description of the pair - density wave state . in secs .",

    "[ sec : history ] we discuss the connections that exist between the pdw state and other states discussed in the literature , particularly the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states .",

    "this paper is partly a review of our recent work on the theory of the pdw state@xcite and of other related work , with an updated discussion of the current experimental status .",
    "however in this paper we have also included many new results , particularly the dmrg analysis of pdw states in strongly correlated systems of section [ sec : dmrg ] , and the connection bewteen the pdw state and non - collinear order and time - reversal symmetry breaking of section [ sec : tbreaking ] .",
    "[ sec : order ]    the order parameter whose non - zero expectation value defines a superconducting state is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fermionic field operator which creates an electron with spin polarization @xmath16 at position @xmath17 .",
    "further distinctions between different superconducting states can be drawn on the basis of the spatial and spin symmetries of @xmath18 . in crystalline solids ,",
    "all familiar superconducting states respect the translational symmetry of the solid , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is any bravais lattice vector .",
    "consequently , the symmetries of the state can be classified by the irreducible representations of the point group - colloquially as s - wave , d - wave , p - wave , etc . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling",
    ", superconducting states can be classified , as well , by their transformation under spin rotations as singlet or triplet .",
    "finally , the superconducting state can either preserve or break time reversal symmetry ( as in @xmath21 ) .    in the presence of quenched disorder",
    ", the underlying hamiltonian does not have any particular spatial symmetries , so the classification of distinct superconducting states by their symmetries ( other than time reversal ) , at first seems difficult .",
    "however , there are several ways that this can be accomplished @xcite , of which the most obvious is to consider the symmetries of the configuration averaged order parameter @xmath22 where @xmath23 signifies the thermal average , and @xmath24 signifies an average over realizations of the disorder configuration .",
    "it is clear , for example , that under most circumstances , a macroscopic `` phase sensitive '' measurement of the symmetry of the order parameter will give @xcite a result consistent with a classification based on the symmetry of the configuration averaged order parameter .",
    "the striped superconductor is an example of a state , which has more generally called @xcite a pair density wave ( pdw ) , in which the translational symmetry of the crystal is spontaneously broken as well , so that @xmath25 exhibits non - trivial dependence on @xmath20 . however , this by itself , is insufficient to identify a new state of matter . in a system with coexisting charge - density - wave ( cdw ) and",
    "superconducting order , the cdw itself introduces a new periodicity into the problem , which must generically be reflected in a spatial modulation of @xmath26 , as well .",
    "models in the large @xmath27 approximation@xcite .",
    "this problem has also been discussed in one - dimensional systems@xcite . ] as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : op ] , an analysis of the implications of a generic theory of coupled order parameters implies @xcite that in a state of coexisting order , a ( possibly small ) modulation of the superconducting order with the same spatial period as that of the cdw will be induced .",
    "none - the - less , in such a state , there still exists a `` dominant '' uniform component to the superconducting order parameter , which we define as the spatial average of the sc order parameter : @xmath28 where @xmath27 is the number of unit cells in the system .    instead",
    ", the pure pdw in a crystal is a state in which @xmath18 is non - zero , but all uniform components vanish , @xmath29 for any @xmath17 and @xmath30 .",
    "just as a cdw is often defined in terms of a fundamental harmonic , so a pdw state is characterized by the smallest value of the crystal momentum , @xmath31 , for which @xmath32 \\langle \\psi_{\\sigma}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{r } ) \\psi_{\\sigma^\\prime}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}^\\prime+\\mathbf{r})\\rangle,\\ ] ] has a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "along the x direction , can be classified as having @xmath33-wave or @xmath34-wave symmetry , based on whether or not the the order parameter changes sign under reflection through a symmetry plane parallel to the x axis , but any distinction one would like to draw between a striped version of an s - wave and a d@xmath35-wave superconductor are in precise , not based on broken symmetries but on quantitative differences in local pairing correlations , and so do not define distinct phases of matter .",
    "however , a checkerboard pdw , with symmetry related ordering vectors @xmath31 and @xmath36 along the x and y axes , respectively , can be classified as s - wave or @xmath37-wave , depending on how it transforms under rotation by @xmath38 . ]",
    "note that the theory of coupled order parameters @xcite implies that the existence of pdw order with ordering vector @xmath31 generically implies the existence of cdw order with ordering vector @xmath39 , but so long as @xmath40 , no cdw ordering with wave vector @xmath31 is expected .",
    "a `` striped superconductor '' refers to the special case in which the independent ordering vectors are all parallel to each other ( `` unidirectional pdw '' ) .",
    "one of the prime new characteristics of a striped superconductor which is different from a uniform superconductor is its complex sensitivity to quenched disorder .",
    "as we shall see , for much the same reasons that disorder destroys long - range cdw order , under most relevant circumstances , even weak disorder causes the configuration averaged pdw order parameter to vanish : @xmath41 however , as in the case of an xy spin - glass , this is not the whole story : it is possible to define an analogue of the edwards - anderson order parameter , @xmath42 and for weak enough disorder , although in three dimensions it can exist below a non - zero superconducting glass transition temperature .",

    "we have not further studied this potentially interesting state . ]",
    "there is one more extension that is useful ",
    "we define a charge @xmath43 superconducting order parameter : @xmath44 where we have introduced a compact notation in which @xmath45 , etc .",
    "naturally , in any state with charge 2e superconducting order , @xmath46 , some components of the charge 4e order parameter will also be non - zero .",
    "this can be seen from the theory of coupled order parameters presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : op ] . at mean - field level",
    ", it can be seen by applying wick s theorem to the expression in eq .",
    "[ phi4 ] to express @xmath47 as a sum of pairwise products of @xmath18 s : @xmath48 .",
    "there are two reasons to consider this order parameter . in the first place , it is clear from the above that even in the pdw state , although the uniform component of @xmath18 vanishes , the uniform component of @xmath49 .",
    "more importantly , @xmath47 ordering can be more robust than the pdw ordering . specifically , under some circumstances @xcite , it is possible for thermal or quantum fluctuations to destroy the pdw order by restoring translational symmetry without restoring large - scale gauge symmetry ; in this case , appropriate components of @xmath47 remain non - zero , even though @xmath18 vanishes identically .",
    "this is the only potentially realistic route we know of to charge @xmath43 superconductivity .",
    "superconductivity arises in systems in which electrons can form 4 particle bound - states , but do not form 2 particle or many particle bound states ( phase separation ) - see , for example , @xcite .",
    "however , this involves unrealistically strong attractive interactions and an unpleasant amount of fine tuning of parameters . ]    in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , distinct phases with translationally invariant charge @xmath43 ordering can be classified according to the total spin of the order parameter , which in this case can be spin 2 , 1 , or 0 .",
    "manifestly , any charge @xmath43 superconducting state which results from the partial melting of a singlet pdw will itself have spin 0 .",
    "as with paired superconductors , the charge 4e order parameter can also be classified according to its transformation properties under action of the point - group of the host crystal .",
    "for instance , in a crystal with a @xmath50 symmetry , taking the points @xmath51 to lie on the vertices of a square , the transformation properties of @xmath47 under rotation by @xmath38 can be used to classify distinct spin-0 states as being d - wave or s - wave .",
    "the definitions given here in terms of possible behaviors of the order parameter are natural from a taxonomic viewpoint . in particular",
    ", the striped superconductor seems at first to be a rather straightforward generalization of familiar uniform superconducting states .",
    "however , both at the microscopic level of the `` mechanism '' of formation of such a state , and at the phenomenological level of macroscopically observable implications of the state , the problem is full of subtleties and surprises , as discussed below .",
    "[ sec : experiment ]    we now summarize some of the observations that lead to the conclusion that la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with @xmath7 is currently the most promising candidate experimental system as a realization of a striped superconductor @xcite .",
    "firstly , the existence of `` stripe order '' is unambiguous .",
    "it is well known ( from neutron @xcite and x - ray @xcite scattering studies ) that unidirectional cdw ( charge - stripe ) and sdw ( spin - stripe ) orders exist in la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .",
    "such spin and charge stripe orders were originally studied in la@xmath52nd@xmath53sr@xmath54cuo@xmath2 @xcite , and they have now been confirmed in la@xmath55eu@xmath56sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , substantial spin stripe order has been observed in la@xmath3cuo@xmath57 @xcite , zn - doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2",
    "@xcite , and in the spin - glass regime of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2  ( @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "while the spin - stripe order in underdoped but superconducting la@xmath0sr@xmath59cuo@xmath2  ( @xmath60 ) is weak in the absence of an applied magnetic field , it has been observed @xcite that readily accessible magnetic fields ( which partially suppress the superconducting order ) produce well - developed and reproducible spin - stripe order . for la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with @xmath7 , the charge ordering temperature is 53  k and the spin ordering temperature is 40  k @xcite .",
    "in addition to spin and charge ordering , la@xmath0ba@xmath61cuo@xmath62 with @xmath7 exhibits transport and thermodynamic behavior that is both striking and complex .",
    "we will not rehash all of the details here ( see @xcite ) ; however , there are two qualitative features of the data on which we would like to focus : 1 ) with the onset of spin - stripe order at 40  k , there is a large ( in magnitude ) and strongly temperature dependent enhancement of the anisotropy of the resistivity and other properties , such that below 40 k the in - plane charge dynamics resemble those of a superconductor , while in the @xmath63-direction the system remains poorly metallic .",
    "the most extreme illustration of this occurs in the temperature range @xmath64 , in which the in - plane resistivity is immeasurably small , while the @xmath63-axis resistivity is in the 110 m@xmath65-cm range , so that the resistivity anisotropy ratio is consistent with infinity .",
    "2 ) despite the fact that signatures of superconductivity onset at temperatures in excess of 40 k , and that angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) has inferred a `` gap '' @xcite of order 20 mev , the fully superconducting state ( _ i.e. _ , the meissner effect and zero resistance in all directions ) only occurs below a critical temperature of 4 k. it is very difficult to imagine a scenario in which a strong conventional superconducting order develops locally on such high scales , but fully orders only at such low temperatures in a system that is three dimensional , non - granular in structure , and not subjected to an external magnetic field .",
    "evidence that similar , although somewhat less extreme transport and thermodynamic anomalies accompany stripe ordering can be recognized , in retrospect , in other materials in the 214 family .",
    "for example , in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with @xmath66 and 0.10 , the anisotropy of the resistivity ( @xmath63-axis vs.  in - plane ) rapidly grows towards @xmath67 as the superconducting @xmath68 is approached from above @xcite . in the case of la@xmath69nd@xmath53sr@xmath61cuo@xmath2 , evidence for dynamical layer decoupling",
    "is provided by measurements of the anisotropic onset of the meissner effect @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the resistivity ratio in this material @xcite only reaches @xmath70 ; this may be limited by enhanced in - plane resistivity due to disorder @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an unexpectedly strong layer decoupling in the charge dynamics produced by the application of a transverse magnetic field in has been observed @xcite , but only in the underdoped range of @xmath71 where the magnetic field also induces spin stripe order @xcite .",
    "we shall see that the anomalous sensitivity of a striped superconductor to quenched disorder can account for the existence of a broad range of temperatures between the onset of strongly developed superconducting correlations on intermediate scales and the actual macroscopic transition temperature to a state of long - range coherence .",
    "moreover , given the crystal structure of the low temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) phase of , there is a special symmetry of the striped superconducting state which produces interlayer decoupling .",
    "specifically , because the stripes in alternate planes are oriented perpendicular to one another ( as shown in fig.[fig : spiral]a ) , there is no first order josephson coupling between neighboring planes . indeed ,",
    "analogous features of the spin - stripe order , which have gone largely unnoticed in the past , are accounted for @xcite by the same geometric features of the striped state .",
    "when spin - stripe order occurs , the in - plane correlation length can be very long , in the range of 100600    @xcite , but the interplanar correlation length is never more than a few   @xcite , a degree of anisotropy that can not be reasonably explained simply on the basis of the anisotropy in the magnitude of the exchange couplings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , despite the presence of long correlation lengths , true long - range spin - stripe order has never been reported .",
    "it will be made clear that the superconducting stripe order and the spin stripe order share the same periodicity and the same geometry , so both the interlayer decoupling and the suppression by quenched disorder of the transition to a long - range ordered state can be understood as arising from the same considerations applied to both the unidirectional sdw and pdw orders .",
    "[ sec : other ]    data which clearly reveal the existence of spin - stripe order , or that provide compelling evidence of of pdw order in other families of cuprates is less extensive .",
    "however , considerable evidence of a tendency to spin stripe order in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 has started to accumulate@xcite , and there are some persistent puzzles concerning the interpretation of various experiments in a number of cuprates that , we would like to speculate , may reflect the presence of pdw order . in this section , we will mention some of these puzzles , and will return to discuss why they may be indicative of pdw order in sec .",

    "is often regarded as the most ideal cuprate , having minimal structural and chemical disorder , and less tendency to stripe or any other type of charge ordering than the 214 cuprates .",
    "( sometimes the cuprates with the highest transition temperatures , such as , are viewed as being similarly pristine . )",
    "however , in its underdoped regime it is well known that exhibits temperature - dependent in - plane anisotropic transport @xcite as well as fluctuating spin stripe order @xcite .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments have provided strong evidence that underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( with @xmath72 ) has nematic order below a critical temperature @xmath73  k @xcite . even more recent neutron scattering experiments by hinkov _",
    "@xcite on the same sample find that a modest @xmath63-axis magnetic field stabilizes an incommensurate static spin ordered state , detectable as a pair of peaks in the elastic scattering displaced by a distance in the crystallographic @xmath74 direction from the nel ordering vector .",
    "given the newfound evidence of spin - stripe related structures in , it is plausible that here , too , striped superconductivity may occur .",
    "however , the differences in the 3d crystal structure , and especially the weak orthorhombicity , would make the macroscopic properties of a pdw distinctly different in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 than in the 214 cuprates .",
    "a remarkable recent discovery is that underdoped appears to exhibit signatures of spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking ( at zero magnetic field ) below a critical temperature comparable to that for the nematic ordering .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite exhibits similar signatures . )",
    "various theoretical scenarios for the existence of time - reversal symmetry breaking predated these experiments , and so in some sense predicted them @xcite .",
    "however , given that _ both _ nematic order and time - reversal symmetry breaking are seemingly present simultaneously in the same samples with comparable critical temperatures , it is reasonable to hope that both phenomena have an underlying common explanation .",
    "if we think of the superconducting order parameter as an xy pseudo - spin , then the pdw order is a form of collinear antiferromagnetism , and time - reversal symmetry breaking corresponds to non - collinear order of the pseudospins . as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : tbreaking ] , weak time reversal symmetry breaking can occur in a pdw state due to various patterns of geometric frustration in three dimensions or as a consequence of the existence of certain types of defects , such as twin boundaries .",
    "( see , also , @xcite . )",
    "there is a large body of stm and arpes data , especially on bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath8  and bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cuo@xmath75 , which has revealed a surprisingly rich and difficult to interpret set of spectral features associated with the d - wave superconducting gap and a d - wave pseudo - gap whose origin is controversial .",
    "indeed , there is a clear `` nodal - anti nodal dichotomy '' @xcite in the behavior of the measured single - particle spectral functions .",
    "some aspects of the data are suggestive that there is a single superconducting origin of all gap features , with anisotropic effects of superconducting fluctuations leading to the observed dichotomy .",
    "other aspects suggest that there are at least two distinct origins of the near - nodal and the antinodal gaps .",
    "it is possible that pdw ordering tendencies can synthesize both aspects of the interpretation . in the presence of both uniform and pdw superconducting order , there are two distinct order parameters , both of which open gaps on portions of the fermi surface , but they are both superconducting , and so they can smoothly evolve into one another . (",
    "note that an early study @xcite of modulated structures seen in stm @xcite concluded that they could be understood in terms of just such a two - superconducting - gap state . )    more generally , one of the most remarkable features of the pseudo - gap phenomena is the existence of what appears to be superconducting fluctuations , detectable @xcite for instance in the nernst and magnetization signal , over a surprisingly broad range of temperatures and doping concentrations . at a broad - brush level @xcite , these phenomena are a consequence of a phase stiffness scale that is small compared to the pairing scale . however , it is generally difficult to understand the existence of such a broad fluctuational regime on the basis of any sensible microscopic considerations .",
    "the glassy nature of the ordering phenomena in a pdw may hold the key to this central paradox of htc phenomenology , as it gives rise to an intrinsically broad regime in which superconducting correlations extend over large , but not infinite distances .",
    "[ sec : microscopic ]    from a microscopic viewpoint , the notion that a pdw   phase could be stable at first sounds absurd . intuitively , the superconducting state can be thought of as the condensed state of charge @xmath76 bosons .",
    "however , in the absence of magnetic fields , the ground - state of a bosonic fluid is always node - less , independent of the strength of the interactions , and therefore can not support a state in which the superconducting order parameter changes sign .",
    "thus , for a pdw state to arise , microscopic physics at scales less than or of order the pair - size , @xmath77 , must be essential .",
    "this physics reflects an essential difference between superfluids of paired fermions and preformed bosons @xcite .",
    "our goal in this section is to shed some light on the mechanism by which strongly interacting electrons can form a superconducting ground - state with alternating signs of the order parameter .",
    "we will consider the case of a unidirectional ( striped ) superconductor , but the same considerations apply to more general forms of pdw order .",
    "we will not discuss the origin of the pairing which leads to superconductivity .",
    "likewise , we will not focus on the mechanism of translation symmetry breaking by the density wave , as that is similar to the physics of cdw and sdw formation .",
    "our focus is on the _ sign alternation _ of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , in much of this discussion , we will adopt a model in which we have alternating stripes of superconductor and correlated insulator .",
    "the system looks like an array of extended superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junctions , and we will primarily be concerned with computing the josephson coupling across the insulating barriers . if the effective josephson coupling is positive , then a uniform phase ( normal ) superconducting state is favored , but if the coupling is negative ( favoring a @xmath13 junction ) , then a striped superconducting phase is found .",
    "so long as time reversal symmetry is neither spontaneously nor explicitly broken , the josephson coupling , @xmath78 between two superconductors must be real .",
    "if it is positive , as is the usual case , the energy is minimized by the state in which the phase difference across the junction is 0 ; if it is negative , a phase difference of @xmath13 is preferred , leading to a `` @xmath13 junction . ''",
    "@xmath13 junctions have been shown , both theoretically and experimentally , to occur for two distinct reasons : they can be a consequence of strong correlation effects in the junction region between two superconductors @xcite or due to the internal structure ( _ e.g. _ d - wave symmetry ) of the superconductors , themselves @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have provided examples of @xmath13 junctions which build on the first set of ideas . unlike the previously studied cases , these @xmath13 junctions were _ extended _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath78 is proportional to the cross sectional `` area '' of the junction ) .",
    "however , since the problem was solved analytically ( treating the tunneling between the superconducting and the insulating regions by perturbation theory ) , we were limited to somewhat artificial models .",
    "for example , tunneling between the sites in the insulating regime was neglected . in this section ,",
    "we first summarize the perturbative results of @xcite , and then present numerical ( dmrg ) results for an extended sis junction . under some circumstances , @xmath79 , but we also find a considerable region of parameter space where where @xmath80 . finally , we discuss how this result can be generalized to an infinite array of junctions , forming a 2d unidirectional pdw .",

    "to inter - plane coupling in the ltt case , the period of the coupling between a uniform and a striped superconductor in the relative phase is @xmath13 , _ i.e. _ _ half _ of the period of the coupling between two uniform superconductors .",
    "[ sec : history ]    the notion of a superconducting state with spontaneously generated oscillations in the sign of the order parameter has cropped up , under various guises , a number of times in the past .",
    "it is worthwhile to recount some of these circumstances , not only in the interest of scholarship , but also to broaden the range of phenomena which can be addressed within the same conceptual framework .",
    "since the superconducting order parameter is a charge @xmath76 scalar field , it is often assumed that it is possible to think of the superconducting state as a bose condensed state of charge @xmath76 bosons .",
    "in contrast , most classic treatments of the subject @xcite emphasize that many features of bcs theory , especially those associated with quasiparticle coherence factors , can not be understood in this way . at the very least , a bosonic theory is inadequate to capture basic features of the groundstate of any superconductor which has gapless quasiparticles , either because of the order parameter symmetry ( _ e.g. _ d - wave ) or because of scattering from magnetic impurities ( gapless superconductor ) .    even ignoring the possibility of gapless quasiparticles , there are qualitative possibilities in a fermionic system that can not occur in a bosonic system .",
    "a feature of a time reversal invariant bosonic system is that the ground - state can be chosen to be real and nodeless .",
    "thus , the order parameter in a bose - condensed system must have a phase which is independent of position .",
    "the @xmath13 junctions , which we have been discussing , are possible only because of the composite character of the superconducting order parameter @xcite .",
    "there have been several previous theoretical studies which have found circumstances under which @xmath13 junctions might occur @xcite .",
    "more recently , the existence of such @xmath13 junctions in the predicted circumstances have been confirmed by experiment .",
    "the first such experiments @xcite were significant as the `` phase sensitive '' measurements which definitively established the d - wave symmetry of the superconducting order in the cuprates .",
    "more recently , however , mesoscopic @xmath13 junctions between two s - wave superconductors have been constructed and characterized @xcite . in our opinion , these latter experiments are also landmarks in the study of superconductivity .",
    "they establish that @xmath13 junctions , the essential ingredient for the existence of striped superconductors , are physically possible .      in a superconductor with negligible spin - orbit coupling , it is possible to generate an imbalance in the population of up and down spin quasiparticles , either by applying a magnetic field in a geometry in which it predominantly couples to the electron spins , or by injecting a non - equilibrium population of quasiparticles from a neighboring ferromagnet @xcite . in the related systems of cold fermionic atomic gases , it is possible to vary the population of up and down spin atoms independently , and to study the effect of this population imbalance on the superfluid state @xcite . while a first order quenching of the superconducting state is possible under these circumstances ,",
    "there has also been considerable discussion of the possibility of spatially modulated superconducting states , so called fflo states @xcite .",
    "two distinct states of this sort have been considered : ( 1 ) the ff state @xcite , in which the order parameter has constant magnitude but a phase which twists as a function of position according to @xmath369 , where @xmath370 is the difference between the up spin and down spin fermi momentum . ( 2 ) the lo state @xcite , in which the order parameter remains real , but oscillates in sign with a period @xmath371 .",
    "the lo state is similar in structure to the striped superconductor considered here . in the order parameter theory presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : landau ] , it corresponds to @xmath372 in eq .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the parallel with the ff state ( which is realized in the order parameter theory for @xmath373 ) is less crisp , but when superconducting striped spirals which spontaneously break time reversal symmetry arise due to the appropriate type of geometric frustration of the josephson couplings ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tbreaking ] ) , states that are in many ways analogous to the ff state also occur in striped superconductors .",
    "thus , many of the physical phenomena we have discussed in this paper are pertinent to the fflo phases in more weakly correlated systems , with the added richness @xcite in the case of cold atomic gasses that there are conserved quantities associated with the continuous rotational invariance of the underlying hamiltonian .",
    "however , the fflo states arise from the explicit breaking of time reversal symmetry .",
    "absent a magnetic field , kramer s theorem implies perfect nesting between time - reversed pairs of states on opposite sides of the fermi surface , so bcs pairing always occurs preferentially at @xmath374 .",
    "this constraint is removed when time reversal symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "one can think of the fflo states as taking advantage of the `` best '' remaining approximate nesting vector , @xmath370 , in the two - particle channel .",
    "alternatively , one can think of the lo state as consisting of a set of discommensurations @xcite such that the excess spin - up quasiparticles are incorporated in mid - gap states localized near the core of the discommensuration .",
    "the energetic considerations that lead to the fflo states are thus very different than the strong - coupling physics that gives rise to the striped superconductor .",
    "the fact that the fflo states explicitly break time reversal symmetry implies that they are macroscopically distinct ( as phases of matter ) from the striped superconductors that preserve this symmetry . even in comparison with striped states which spontaneously break time reversal symmetry",
    ", the distinction remains that the fflo states have a net magnetization , while the striped superconductor does not .",
    "conversely , the fflo states generally have no particular relation to other flavors of electronic ordering , while striped superconductors , as is characteristic of all electronic liquid crystals , embody a subtle interplay between multiple ordering tendencies .",
    "specifically , since the striped superconductor seems to be generally associated with the strong coupling physics of doped antiferromagnets , there is a natural sense in which antiferromagnetism , charge density wave formation , and striped superconductivity are intertwined .",
    "one explicit way in which the relation between several order parameters can be more intimate than in a generic theory of `` competing orders '' is if there is an emergent symmetry at low energies which unifies them . in particular",
    ", the order parameter structure of the pdw state , involving several order parameters coupled to each other , evokes the @xmath10 approach of a unified description of antiferromagnetism and uniform @xmath11-wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "indeed , by tuning the parameters of the effective landau - ginzburg theory that we presented in other sections it is possible to achieve an effective enlarged symmetry which makes it possible `` rotate '' the striped superconducting order and charge stripe order parameters into each other . even if the enlarged symmetry is not exact , a rotation of the order parameters is possible but with a finite energy cost ( similar to a `` spin flop '' . )",
    "it is also worth noting that a symmetry which allows a similar form of unification of @xmath11-wave superconductivity , electron nematicity , and @xmath11-density wave order @xcite ( ddw ) has recently been found to exist under special circumstances by kee _",
    "it is therefore possible that there could exist additional forms of striped superconducting states which interleave these orders .",
    "thus , it is possible to view the pdw state as a `` liquid crystalline '' analog of the @xmath10 scenario .",
    "indeed , the possibility of an @xmath10 `` spiral '' was discussed previously by zhang @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the context of any conventional landau - ginzburg treatment of a system of competing orders , a general theorem @xcite precludes a sign change of any component of the order parameter , and hence precludes the existence of spirals . in order to get a pdw state from an interplay between d - wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , unconventional",
    "gradient dependent interactions between the different order parameters , such as those discussed in @xcite , must play a significant role in the physics .",
    "in other words , in addition to the standard couplings allowed by a theory with several order parameters , the existence of a stripe order ( for instance ) in the charge order parameter must be able to induce a texture in the superconducting order as well .",
    "a useful analogy to keep in mind is the mcmillan - degennes theory of the nematic - smectic transition in classical liquid crystals in which the nematic order parameter acts as a component of a gauge field thus coupling to the _ phase _ of the smectic order , or in blue phases of liquid crystals .",
    "( for a detailed discussion of these topics in liquid crystals see , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . ) in fact , ref @xcite presents a theory of fflo states in ultra - cold atoms with gauge - like couplings ( _ i.e. _ covariant derivative couplings ) that relate the stripe ( and spiral ) order to the superconducting order .",
    "in addition to the conceptual advantages , noted above , the liquid - crystal picture of the pdw state offers a direct way to classify the phase transitions ( both quantum and thermal ) out of this state .",
    "thus , in addition to a direct transition to a normal state , intermediate phases characterized with composite order parameters , are also possible leading to an interesting phase diagram .",
    "we will explore these issues in a separate publication @xcite .      in the context of the cuprates ,",
    "there have been several studies looking for a striped superconducting state in the @xmath375 or hubbard models . on the one hand ,",
    "extensive , but not exhaustive dmrg calculations by white and scalapino @xcite have consistently failed to find evidence in support of any sort of spontaneously occurring @xmath13 junctions . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of variational monte carlo and renormalized mean field calculations have concluded that the striped superconductor is either the ground - state of such a model @xcite , under appropriate circumstances , or at least close in energy to the true ground state @xcite .",
    "these latter calculations are certainly encouraging , in the sense that they suggest that there is no obvious energetic reason to _ rule out _ the existence of spontaneously occurring pdw order in strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "however , the fact remains that no spontaneous @xmath13-junction formation has yet been observed in dmrg or other `` unbiased '' studies of the @xmath375 or the purely repulsive hubbard models , indicating that there remain basic unsettled issues concerning the microscopic origins of @xmath13 junctions .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced the pdw phase and studied its properties theoretically . in terms of symmetry ,",
    "the pdw is distinct from the standard uniform superconductor .",
    "while some of its properties are similar to those of a uniform superconductor ( _ e.g. _ , zero resistance ) , others are markedly different : most importantly , the existence of a fermi surface ( and hence a finite density of states ) in the ordered phase @xcite , the possibility of frustration of the inter - layer coupling ( depending on the lattice geometry ) , and the strong sensitivity to ( non - magnetic ) disorder .",
    "generically , the pdw state in the presence of weak disorder is expected to give way to a `` superconducting glass '' phase , in which the configuration average of the _ local _ superconducting order parameter vanishes , but the edwards - anderson order parameter is non - zero ( and hence gauge symmetry is broken ) .",
    "even though the ordered pdw state itself is time reversal invariant , time reversal symmetry breaking is a very natural consequence of pdw order , either in the superconducting glass phase , or as a way of relieving the frustration of the josephson couplings in some crystal structures .",
    "specifically , frustration can lead to non - collinear ground state configurations of the superconducting pseudo - spins ( representing the local phase of the superconducting order ) , which are analogous to the non - collinear ground states which are often found in frustrated spin systems .",
    "an even more exotic state that can naturally emerge from a `` parent '' pdw state is a superconductor with a charge @xmath43 order parameter @xcite , which can result when the cdw part of the pdw order is melted by either quantum or thermal fluctuations .",
    "the occurrence of pdw states in microscopic models is an intrinsically strong coupling effect , since pdw order ( much like cdw or sdw ) is not an instability of a generic fermi surface . in this paper , we have provided a `` proof of principle '' of a not - too - contrived , strongly correlated , microscopic model with a pdw ground state .",
    "this model mimics some features of the striped state found in the cuprates ( _ e.g. _ , it has charge stripes separated by @xmath13-phase - shifted spin stripes ) .",
    "whether a pdw state can be found in more realistic models , which include such features as uniformly repulsive interactions and a d - wave - like order parameter , remains to be settled .",
    "doped mott insulators are strongly correlated systems whose ground states have a strong tendency to form liquid - crystalline - like@xcite inhomogeneous phases,@xcite . in this regard",
    ", the pdw state is an electronic liquid crystal phase in which the superconducting and charge / spin orders do not compete with each other but rather are intertwined .",
    "as some of us have noted earlier,@xcite the observation of a high pairing scale in such an electronically inhomogeneous state is suggestive of the existence of an optimal degree of inhomogeneity for superconductivity .",
    "indeed , recent arpes data suggest that the stripe order that develops in does not suppress the pairing scale.@xcite , where the signatures of the pdw state are strongest . ]",
    "the fact that the pairing scale is large in this material suggests that the development of charge stripe order suppresses the development of superconducting coherence but not pairing .",
    "in fact , it gives credence to the argument that there is a connection between the emergence of charge order and the mechanism of superconducting pairing.@xcite    however , at present , it is unclear to what extent pdw order should be expected to be common where stripe order occurs .",
    "on the purely theoretical side , pdw order has proven elusive in dmrg studies of models@xcite with entirely repulsive interactions .",
    "indeed , in a previous publication@xcite , we showed that in any weakly interacting superconductor , @xmath13 junctions can only occur under exceedingly fine - tuned circumstances .",
    "it is clear from variational calculations@xcite that for strong interactions , the differences in energy between the pdw and uniform sign superconducting states in striped systems is relatively small ; what particular features of the microscopic physics tip the balance one way or another is still not clear .",
    "accordingly , it is not clear , in the absence of unambiguous experimental evidence , whether in the context of the cuprates , we should expect the pdw state to be a rare occurrence , perhaps stabilized by some particular detail of the electronic structure of , or if instead we should infer that some degree of local pdw order exists in any cuprate in which evidence of local stripe correlations can be adduced .    to close this section",

    "the analysis of the pdw state was motivated by the experimental observations on .",
    "having studied the nature of this phase , we will now discuss to what extent the signatures of the pdw state are consistent with experiment .",
    "finally , we speculate on the possible relevance of these ideas to other members of the cuprate family .      as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , the onset of clearly identifiable 2d superconducting correlations in  with @xmath376 occurs at @xmath377  k , together with the onset of static spin - stripe order .",
    "it would be natural to associate this behavior with the simultaneous onset of local pdw order ; however , an attempt to reach a consistent interpretation of a broad range of results leads to a more nuanced story .",
    "the original motivation for applying the pdw concept to la@xmath378ba@xmath379cuo@xmath2 was to explain the dynamical layer decoupling through the frustration of the interlayer josephson coupling in the ltt phase @xcite , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tbreaking ] .",
    "it provides a compelling account for the induced dynamical layer decoupling produced in underdoped by a modest @xmath63-axis magnetic field @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of the pdw to disorder which limits the growth of the superconducting correlation length within the planes , provides a natural explanation for the existence of an enormously enhanced `` superconducting fluctuation '' regime , characterized by enhanced contributions of local superconductivity to the electrical conductivity and to ( strongly anisotropic ) diamagnetism , but with no global phase coherence .",
    "thus , it naturally accounts for the most dramatic aspects of the experimental data @xcite below the spin ordering temperature @xmath380 .",
    "we consider this strong evidence that the basic ingredients of the theory are applicable to the stripe ordered state of and closely related materials . in addition , the observed transition at temperature @xmath381 into a state with zero resistance in all direction has a natural interpretation in terms of an assumed pdw state as the superconducting glass transition @xcite . besides having zero resistance",
    ", the glass phase presumably shows no meissner effect and zero critical current .",
    "if this latter identification is correct , it leads to the further prediction that this phase should be characterized by various phenomena associated with slow dynamics , characteristic of spin glasses , as well as with breaking of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the experimental detection of such phenomena below @xmath381 supercurrents ) would serve as further confirmation of the existence of a pdw in this material .",
    "( for example , the glass phase would likely exhibit a metastable zero - field kerr effect @xcite . )",
    "one can also look for evidence for the pdw in single - particle properties .",
    "one of the key features of the pdw stripes is the gapping of single - particle excitations in the antinodal region , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ; in contrast , the nodal states remain ungapped . from the underlying band - structure , one sees that the largest contribution to the density of states with energies near @xmath382 comes from the antinodal regions ( where the dispersion is relatively flat ) ; thus , the onset of local pdw order should have a major impact on properties sensitive to the total density of states .",
    "conversely , properties that are largely determined by near nodal quasiparticle dynamics , which presumably includes the quasiparticle contribution to the in - plane conductivity , may be less strongly affected",
    ".    observed striking changes in various transport properties of several stripe order cuprates can be interpreted in this light as being suggestive of the appearance of local pdw order at the onset of _",
    "charge_-stripe order at @xmath383 ( which is generally somewhat higher than @xmath380 ) . in  and",
    "nd- and eu - doped , it is observed that the in - plane thermopower drops dramatically below @xmath383 @xcite as does the hall resistivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the opening of a superconducting - like gap as the temperature drops below @xmath384 results in an observed @xcite suppression of the in - plane optical conductivity at frequencies below 40  mev .",
    "in contrast , the in - plane dc - resistivity changes relatively little @xcite upon cooling through @xmath383 .",
    "putting aside the issue of the onset - temperature , the notion that stripe ordered cuprates exhibit local pdw order is also supported by arpes studies . for example , measurements on stripe - ordered la@xmath52nd@xmath53sr@xmath54cuo@xmath2 at @xmath385  k ( @xmath386 ) reveal a gapless nodal arc of states covering roughly a third of the nominal fermi surface , as well as a gap reaching 30 mev in the antinodal region @xcite .",
    "temperature - dependent arpes measurements on  with @xmath376 indicate that , for temperatures above the spin - ordering transition , there is a gapless nodal arc of states , together with a substantial antinodal gap @xcite .",
    "however , there are several aspects of this story which require further analysis .",
    "firstly , there is the issue that different aspects of the crossovers we would like to identify with the onset of local pdw order appear to onset at different temperatures .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent , as a crossover ( as opposed to a phase transition ) can appear to occur at somewhat different temperatures depending on what quantity is measured and how the data is analyzed .",
    "nonetheless , the drop in the thermopower and hall number appears to have a very sharp onset at @xmath383 , while the superconducting like drop in the in - plane resistivity at @xmath380 is also very sharp , at least in 1/8 doped .",
    "[ in this sense , it is reminiscent of the situation @xcite in o doped , where the sharply defined spin ordering and superconducting ordering transitions occur at the same temperature ( in zero field ) with very small uncertainty . ]",
    "a still more perplexing issue arises in correlating the onset of the signatures of 2d superconductivity in la@xmath378ba@xmath379cuo@xmath2 with the thermal evolution of the arpes @xcite spectrum .",
    "below @xmath380 , there is clear evidence of the appearance of a @xmath11-wave - like gap in the nodal region , with the scale of this second gap being smaller than the pre - existing antinodal gap @xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests that uniform @xmath11-wave superconductivity develops and coexists with the pdw superconductor below @xmath380 .",
    "however , this is somewhat problematic , as the proposed explanation of the dynamical interlayer decoupling and the bounded growth of superconducting correlations that occurs below @xmath380 rests on the assumed ( near ) absence of a uniform component of the order parameter in each plane . reconciling",
    "the uniform @xmath11-wave component of the order parameter inferred spectroscopically from arpes studies of with the apparently almost complete absence of such a component inferred from bulk transport measurements on the same material is a challenge for future work .",
    "it may be significant , however , that arpes studies of @xcite and la@xmath55eu@xmath56sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite appear consistent with pure pdw order , ( _ i.e. _ , there is no d - wave gap in the nodal region ) , although the pdw appears to set in at around @xmath383 , which can be substantially greater than @xmath380 in these materials .",
    "the cuprate superconductors are layered materials with varying degrees of quasi - two - dimensional behavior .",
    "evidence for quasi-2d behavior ( and for dimensional crossover ) in the cuprates has existed for a long time and it is well documented .",
    "it is thus useful to compare and contrast this well known behavior with the unexpected layer decoupling effect observed in .    in a quasi-2d system , as a continuous thermodynamic superconducting phase transition",
    "is approached , the in - plane correlation length grows very rapidly .",
    "while at first the fluctuations have a markedly 2d character , very close to the phase transition they rapidly cross over to their ultimate 3d behavior .",
    "dimensional crossover is observed , for instance , in dynamical probes of some cuprates .",
    "high frequency ( @xmath387100 ghz ) conductivity measurements in ( the most quasi-2d material among the cuprates ) by corson et al @xcite showed that ( at those frequencies ) the fluctuation conductivity is 2d - like and exhibits kosterlitz - thouless behavior , as if the cuo@xmath3 planes were effectively decoupled .",
    "similarly , quasi-2d behavior in the dynamic conductivity ( with frequencies in the range 1 - 10 ghz ) has been observed in underdoped near @xmath388 ( but not in overdoped ) by kitano et al @xcite . by probing the system at finite frequency ,",
    "these experiments explore the correlations at a frequency dependent mesoscopic length scale , where sufficiently weak 3d couplings have negligible effect on the physics .",
    "by contrast , the resistive transition both in and in , measured at zero frequency in macroscopic samples , is not of the 2d xy ( kosterlitz - thouless ) type , but rather reflects the three - dimensional nature of these materials .",
    "in contrast , the unusual layer decoupling effect observed in _ stripe - ordered _ takes place in a temperature range where the cuo@xmath3 planes appear to become superconducting ( well above the three - dimensional critical temperature).@xcite the layer decoupling effect is observed in the resistive transition . and is thus not a dimensional crossover effect . as we noted above , in this regime behaves as if for some reason the effective inter - layer josephson coupling is either turned off ( which is unphysical ) or is somehow _",
    "frustrated_.    support for this idea is provided by recent josephson resonance experiments in by schafgans et al@xcite , which essentially measure the c - axis superfluid stiffness , @xmath389 . in the absence of an external magnetic field , @xmath389 has the expected@xcite magnitude , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath389 is proportional to the normal state conductivity at @xmath388 .",
    "however , for underdoped materials , @xmath389 becomes unmeasurably small in the presence of moderate magnetic fields ( @xmath390 ) .",
    "magnetic fields are known to induce static spin - stripe order ( as detected by neutron scattering experiments@xcite ) in precisely the same range of field strengths and hole concentration .",
    "these experiments thus suggest@xcite that the `` fluctuating stripe order '' @xcite seen in at zero field may actually be of the pdw type and that dynamical layer decoupling occurs as static stripe order is stabilized in a magnetic field . indeed , in materials , including and , which exhibit stripe order in zero field",
    ", @xmath389 is found@xcite to be orders of magnitude smaller than its `` expected '' value on the basis of the normal state conductivity .",
    "although there are still open issues , the pdw state ( or its glassy version ) seems to offer a rather compelling explanation for what is otherwise an extremely surprising set of phenomena observed in stripe ordered cuprates .",
    "could these ideas also be relevant to a broader range of phenomena in the cuprates ?",
    "the direct empirical information available @xcite concerning the structure of any sort of static or fluctuating stripe order present in cuprates outside the 214 family is much less clear .. still more recently @xcite , the same authors have demonstrated that modest magnetic fields stabilize static spin - stripe order where primarily fluctuating ( nematic ) order existed at zero field . ]",
    "consequently , any attempt to achieve a theoretical understanding based on the assumed existence of a pdw state is necessarily speculative .",
    "we therefore present the discussion of this final section in the spirit of provocative conjectures , which we believe are deserving of further investigation .",
    "arpes studies of  @xcite and  @xcite have revealed `` fermi arcs '' of gapless states between antinodal pseudogaps .",
    "there has been a great deal of controversy over the nature of the antinodal pseudogap @xcite .",
    "two recent studies of  have reported signatures of bogoliubov quasiparticles in the antinodal gap region @xcite , which was interpreted as being suggestive that the pseudogap is , at least in part , produced by superconducting fluctuations .",
    "on cooling through @xmath388 , a @xmath11-wave gap appears along the nodal arc @xcite . in near optimally doped samples , as @xmath391 , this d - wave gap and the pseudo - gap merge to form a single gap with a simple @xmath392 $ ] form .",
    "however , in underdoped samples , even as @xmath391 , the nodal gap appears to have a different energy scale than the antinodal gap ( _ i.e. _ , they do not merge to form a simple @xmath11-wave gap ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in some ways it is clear that there are two distinct gaps - an antinodal pseudo - gap that might be associated with some sort of `` competing '' order , and a nodal gap , which is clearly superconducting in the sense that it onsets quite sharply at @xmath388 .",
    "however , in other ways it seems that all the gaps have some unifying superconducting character .",
    "we propose that this puzzle may be resolved by postulating that there are two distinct gaps , both with superconducting character in the sense that one is associated with uniform the other with modulated superconducting order . indeed , the measured quasiparticle spectral function in the pseudogap looks somewhat like that of the pdw state ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) , in contrast to bogoliubov quasiparticles ; however , to detect this distinction , one would need to measure a sample containing a single - domain pdw state .",
    "measurements on a nematic pdw state in would average over stripe orientations ; furthermore , the experimental `` quasiparticle '' peaks are quite broad in the pseudogap state @xcite , so that any fine details are hidden by damping .",
    "the overdamping also fills in the spectral weight at @xmath382 , in contrast to the true gap that is found for @xmath393 @xcite .",
    "] moreover , just such a combination of modulated and uniform superconducting orders has been previously proposed on phenomenological grounds to explain @xcite stm spectra @xcite in and other cuprates @xcite .",
    "seemingly more direct evidence of superconducting fluctuations in the normal state of , , and bi@xmath3sr@xmath394la@xmath395cuo@xmath396 has been reported by ong and coworkers @xcite based on measurements of the nernst effect and diamagnetism .",
    "nernst measurements on  @xcite and stm studies of  @xcite suggest that disorder may be important to the existence of the fluctuation effects over a substantial temperature range .",
    "it is intriguing that the onset temperatures of the enhanced nernst response in  has a maximum at @xmath397 @xcite , close to the optimum doping for stripe order .",
    "moreover , taillefer and coworkers @xcite have found close correlations between an enhanced nernst signal and stripe order .",
    "neither the observed sensitivity to disorder nor the association with stripe order , by themselves , necessarily negate the interpretation of these effects in terms of superconducting fluctuations ; however , both would be unusual in the case of a simple , homogeneous d - wave superconductor .",
    "while we are far from having an explicit theory , it seems to us that these general trends are consistent with the existence of a disordered pdw state over at least a portion of the pseudogap phase . specifically , ong and coworkers @xcite have reported the observation of a sublinear dependence of the magnetization on magnetic field ( @xmath398 with @xmath399 ) in a relatively narrow but non - vanishing range of temperatures above @xmath388 in crystals of . this behavior ,",
    "if it truly persists in the limit @xmath400 , must signify the existence of a distinct phase of matter in this range of temperatures , which we very tentatively propose could be a superconducting glass formed from a disordered pdw .",
    "planes @xcite . ]",
    "one of the most intriguing recent discoveries in the cuprates involve several distinct observations of a rather subtle , and not fully understood , form of time reversal symmetry breaking in the pseudogap phase of @xcite and hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath401 @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , various forms of subtle time - reversal symmetry breaking can occur when frustration is added into the pdw mix .",
