    "is an extremely challenging task to maintain the polarization of protons throughout the acceleration to high energies , which explains the lack of polarized @xmath2 or @xmath3 collider experiments in the past . to circumvent this problem , a series of fixed target experiments with longitudinally polarized lepton beams scattered off , e.g. ,",
    "proton targets have been performed at comparatively low energies over the past few years @xcite .",
    "aiming at polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) these experiments have been used to extract first information about the spin dependent parton densities @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 denotes the density of a parton @xmath7 with helicity ` + ' ( ` @xmath8 ' ) in a hadron @xmath9 with helicity ` + ' .",
    "it is important to notice that the @xmath10 contain information _ different _ from that included in the more familiar unpolarized distributions @xmath11 [ defined by taking the sum on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : pdfdef ] ) ] ,",
    "and their measurement is indispensable for a _ complete _ understanding of the partonic structure of hadrons .",
    "however , due to the lack of any experimental information apart from dis and the limited kinematical coverage in @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the available measurements @xcite , our knowledge of the @xmath14 is still rather rudimentary compared to the abundance of results on @xmath7 .    much experimental progress and , hopefully",
    ", exciting new results have to be expected in the next couple of years .",
    "most importantly measurements of , for instance , jet , prompt photon , and @xmath15-boson production rates at the recently completed first polarized @xmath3 collider rhic will vastly reduce our ignorance of the @xmath14 .",
    "ongoing efforts in the fixed target sector by hermes @xcite and ( soon ) by compass @xcite to study , in particular , semi - inclusive dis and charm production , respectively , will contribute to a more complete picture of polarized parton densities as well . here",
    "we will mainly focus on the prospects of a conceivable future polarized upgrade of the hera @xmath2 collider @xcite , which is currently under scrutiny , and highlight on some important measurements uniquely possible at an @xmath2 collider .",
    "having pinned down the polarized parton densities ( [ eq : pdfdef ] ) one can study one of the most fundamental aspects of polarization : the question of how the spin @xmath16 of non - pointlike objects like nucleons is composed of the spin of their constituents , the quarks and gluons , and their orbital angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "the total contribution of quarks and gluons to @xmath16 is determined by the first moments of ( [ eq : pdfdef ] ) , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the ` resolution scale ' at which the nucleon is probed .",
    "the so far unmeasured angular momentum contribution @xmath17 has attracted considerable theoretical interest recently , and it was suggested @xcite that deeply virtual compton scattering @xmath22 in the limit of vanishing momentum transfer @xmath23 _ may _ provide first direct information on @xmath17 , however this subject is beyond the scope of this talk .    the definition of polarized parton densities ( [ eq : pdfdef ] ) also holds true for the hadronic content of _ photons _ , @xmath24 , and can be easily extended to the time - like case , i.e. , spin dependent fragmentation functions , @xmath25 , as well .",
    "both densities have been measured in the unpolarized case , and their @xmath13 evolution provides an important test of perturbative qcd .",
    "needless to stress again that a measurement of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is required for a complete understanding of space- and time - like distributions .",
    "so far @xmath24 is completely unmeasured , and almost nothing is known experimentally about spin dependent fragmentation . it is argued below that a polarized hera would be also an ideal place to learn more about these densities .    our contribution is organized as follows : first we review the spin dependent proton structure and shall give an example of a recent qcd analysis of polarized dis data @xcite .",
    "then the framework is extended to the case of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and theoretical models for these densities are introduced .",
    "next we turn to polarized processes and briefly sketch the basic technical framework and complications due to the appearance of @xmath0 .",
    "finally we discuss the main results of two recently finished nlo calculations : jet @xcite and heavy flavor production @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we have to omit several interesting topics such as @xmath26 , transverse polarization and transversity distributions , single spin processes , etc . some recent results and references can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "longitudinally polarized dis can be described by introducing a structure function @xmath27 , in analogy to @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the helicity - averaged case .",
    "the nlo expression for @xmath27 reads ( suppressing the obvious @xmath12 and @xmath13 dependence ) @xmath30\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the spin dependent wilson coefficients , and the symbol @xmath32 denotes the usual convolution in @xmath12 space . from ( [ eq : g1 ] ) it is obvious that the available inclusive dis data @xcite can reveal only information on @xmath33 , but neither on @xmath34 _ and _ @xmath35 nor on @xmath36 , which enters ( [ eq : g1 ] ) only as an @xmath37 correction .",
    "thus all qcd analyses @xcite have to impose certain _ assumptions _ about the flavor decomposition in order to be able to estimate other hard processes for upcoming experiments like rhic .",
    "alternatively one can stick , of course , to a comprehensive analysis of quantities accessible in polarized dis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 obey the standard dglap @xmath13 evolution equations  with all unpolarized quantities such as splitting functions replaced by their spin dependent counterparts ( given in @xcite )  which are readily solved analytically in mellin @xmath38 moment space .",
    "a subtlety arises in nlo in the non - singlet ( ns ) sector @xcite .",
    "the independent ns combinations @xmath39 and @xmath40 evolve in the unpolarized and the polarized case with the same but interchanged kernels , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that in the unpolarized case the first moment of @xmath42 , the number of valence quarks , is conserved with @xmath13 , whereas in the polarized case @xmath43 refers to a conserved ns axial vector current .",
    "the @xmath14 are constrained by the unpolarized densities via the positivity condition @xmath44 which is exploited in most of the qcd analyses .",
    "of course , the bound ( [ eq : pos ] ) is strictly valid only in lo and is subject to nlo corrections @xcite because the @xmath14 become unphysical , scheme dependent objects in nlo .",
    "however the corrections are not very pronounced , in particular at large @xmath12 @xcite , the only region where ( [ eq : pos ] ) imposes some restrictions in practice and hence ( [ eq : pos ] ) can be used also in nlo .",

    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) is related to the polarized - to - unpolarized cross section ratio @xmath47 , and experimental uncertainties like the absolute normalization conveniently drop out .    as mentioned above",
    ", each qcd fit has to rely on several assumptions .",
    "the shown grsv analysis @xcite is characterized by the choice of a low starting scale for the evolution , @xmath48 , the @xmath49 scheme , and a simple but flexible ansatz for the polarized densities @xmath50 , _ assuming _ that @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the unpolarized reference distributions",
    "@xmath7 the updated grv densities @xcite have been used , which also fixes the choice of @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 ) .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] . to demonstrate that , in particular , the gluon density is hardly constrained at all by present data , two other fits based on additional _ ad hoc _ constraints on @xmath36 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the ` @xmath61 ' fit starts from a vanishing gluon input , and the ` static @xmath36 ' is chosen in such a way that its first moment becomes roughly independent of @xmath13 .",
    "both gluons give also excellent fits to the available data and do not affect the results for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in fact one can obtain fits without changing @xmath64 by more than one unit for an even wider range of gluon inputs .",
    "this uncertainty in @xmath36 is compatible with the findings of other recent analyses such as @xcite .",
    "in addition , similarly agreeable fits are obtained , e.g. , for the choice @xmath65 as well as by using an independent @xmath12 shape for @xmath66 , reflecting the above mentioned uncertainty in the flavor separation .",
    "the range of results for the @xmath14 obtained by the various qcd analyses @xcite gives a rough measure of the theoretical uncertainties due to different assumptions used for the fits .",
    "behaviour of @xmath27 by extrapolating from the measured region @xmath67 to smaller @xmath12 values for different assumptions about @xmath36 .",
    "the solid line is the result obtained using the ` best fit ' @xmath36 of @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . ]",
    "it is interesting to observe that for the ` best fit ' gluon in the grsv framework @xcite the spin of the nucleon ( [ eq : spinsum ] ) is dominantly carried by quarks and gluons at the low bound - state like input scale @xmath53 , and only during the @xmath13 evolution a large negative @xmath68 is being built up in order to compensate for the strong rise of @xmath69 , see fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "however , no definite conclusions can be reached yet because for the ` static @xmath36 ' the situation is completely different , and @xmath16 is entirely of angular momentum origin for _ all _ values of @xmath13 , contrary to what is intuitively expected .",
    "in addition , direct measurements of @xmath17 are completely missing .",
    "inevitably the large uncertainty in @xmath36 implies that the small @xmath12 behaviour of @xmath27 is completely uncertain and not reliably predictable as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this translates also into a sizeable theoretical error for the @xmath70 extrapolation when calculating first moments of @xmath27 , which play an important role in spin physics since they are related to predictions such as the bjorken sum rule @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar to our ignorance of the small @xmath12 behaviour of @xmath28 in the pre - hera era and can be resolved only experimentally .",
    "needless to say that a polarized variant of hera would be of ultimate help here .",
    "in addition , the high @xmath13 region would be accessible for the first time at hera . here",
    "electroweak effects become increasingly important and new structure functions , which probe different combinations of parton densities , enter .",
    "the complete nlo qcd framework for the @xmath13 evolution of @xmath24 and the calculation of the polarized photon structure function @xmath71 , which would be accessible in @xmath72 dis at a future polarized linear collider @xcite , was recently provided in @xcite .",
    "unlike the proton densities the @xmath24 obey an _ inhomogeneous _ evolution equation schematically given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for the flavor ns quark combinations or the singlet ( s ) vector @xmath75 , and @xmath76 denotes the photon - to - parton splitting functions .",
    "again , solutions of ( [ eq : photevol ] ) , which can be decomposed into a ` pointlike ' ( inhomogeneous ) and a ` hadronic ' ( homogeneous ) part , @xmath77 , can be given analytically for @xmath38 moments ( cf .",
    "it should be noted that perturbative instabilities for @xmath71 in the @xmath78 scheme due to the @xmath79 behaviour of the photonic coefficient function @xmath80 @xcite can be avoided , as in the unpolarized case @xcite , by absorbing @xmath80 into the definition of the quark densities @xcite ( @xmath81 scheme ) .     and",
    "@xmath82 evolved to @xmath83 in lo and nlo @xmath84 using the two extreme models explained in the text . ]    at present the @xmath24 are unmeasured , and one has to fully rely on theoretical models . the only guidance is provided by the positivity constraint analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pos ] ) .",
    "the ` current conservation ' ( cc ) condition @xcite , which demands a vanishing first moment of @xmath71 and is automatically fulfilled for the pointlike part @xcite , is not very useful without any data since it can be implemented at @xmath12 values smaller than the one is interested in , say , at @xmath85 . to obtain a realistic estimate for the theoretical uncertainties in @xmath24 coming from the unknown hadronic input",
    ", one can consider two very different models @xcite by either saturating the positivity bound ( [ eq : pos ] ) at @xmath86 ( ` maximal scenario ' ) with the phenomenologically successful unpolarized grv photon densities @xcite or by using a vanishing input ( ` minimal scenario ' ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 for both scenarios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and will be applied below to estimate the prospects of measuring @xmath24 in photoproduction processes at a polarized hera in the future .",
    "studies of _ spin transfer reactions _ could provide further invaluable insight into the field of spin physics .",
    "a non - vanishing twist-2 spin transfer asymmetry requires the measurement of the polarization of one outgoing particle , in addition to having a polarized beam or target , and is sensitive to spin dependent _",
    "fragmentation_. @xmath87 baryons are particularly suited for such studies due to the self - analyzing properties of their dominant weak decay , which were successfully exploited at lep @xcite to reconstruct the @xmath87 spin . in @xcite",
    "a first attempt was made to extract the spin dependent @xmath87 fragmentation functions , @xmath88 , by analyzing these data @xcite , which , however , turned out to be insufficient . rather different , physically conceivable scenarios appear to describe the data equally well , and for the ` unfavoured ' sea quark and gluon fragmentation functions one has to fully rely on mere assumptions . clearly , further measurements are required to test the models proposed in @xcite , and , again , hera can play an important role here .     for unpolarized protons and polarized @xmath87 s and leptons for the three distinct scenarios of @xmath88 of @xcite .",
    "in * a ) * the expected statistical errors for such a measurement at hera are shown , assuming a luminosity of @xmath89 , a lepton beam polarization of @xmath90 , and a @xmath87 detection efficiency of 0.1 . ]",
    "the time - like ( tl ) @xmath88 are defined in a similar way as their space - like ( sl ) counterparts in eq.([eq : pdfdef ] ) via @xmath91 where , e.g. , @xmath92 is the probability for finding a @xmath87 baryon with positive helicity in a parton @xmath7 with positive helicity at a mass scale @xmath21 , carrying a fraction @xmath93 of the parent parton s momentum .",
    "the @xmath13 evolution of ( [ eq : fragdef ] ) is similar to the sl case , and it should be recalled only that the off - diagonal entries in the singlet evolution matrices @xmath94 interchange their role when going from the sl to the tl case , see , e.g. , @xcite .    as a manifestation of the so - called gribov - lipatov relation @xcite the sl and tl splitting functions are equal in lo .",
    "furthermore they are related by analytic continuation ( acr ) of the sl splitting functions ( drell - levy - yan relation @xcite ) , which can be schematically expressed as @xmath95 @xmath96 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the operation @xmath97 analytically continues any function to @xmath98 and correctly adjusts the color factor and the sign @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of the acr beyond the lo in the @xmath99 scheme can be understood in terms of a corresponding breakdown for the @xmath100 dimensional lo splitting functions and can be easily accounted for by a simple factorization scheme transformation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the acr breaking can be calculated , of course , graph - by - graph @xcite in the light - cone gauge method @xcite , which is of course much more cumbersome .",
    "lo and nlo predictions for the semi - inclusive spin asymmetry @xmath101 for the production of polarized @xmath87 s in dis of _ unpolarized protons _ off polarized leptons @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] for three different conceivable models of the @xmath88 mentioned above ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "such types of spin measurements , which would help to pin down the @xmath88 more precisely , can be performed at hera immediately after the spin rotators in front of h1 and zeus have been installed even _ without _ having a polarized proton beam .",
    "similar studies can be done in the photoproduction case where an integrated luminosity of only about @xmath102 would be sufficient @xcite .",
    "helicity transfer reactions can be also examined in @xmath3 collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "to calculate longitudinally polarized cross sections one has to project onto the two independent helicity configurations of the incoming polarized partons ( for simplicity we ignore here helicity transfer processes where the formalism applies in a similar way ) .",
    "this is achieved by using the standard relations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath103\\ ] ] for incoming bosons with momentum @xmath104 and helicity @xmath105 , and where @xmath106 denotes the momentum of the other incoming particle , and @xmath107 for incoming massless quarks with momentum @xmath104 and helicity @xmath108 . using ( [ eq : polgluon ] ) and ( [ eq : polquark ] ) one can calculate the cross sections for unpolarized _ and _ polarized beams _",

    "the possibility to recover well - known unpolarized results ` for free ' is usually regarded as a first important check on the correctness of the spin dependent results .    as usual the presence of ir ,",
    "uv , and collinear singularities demands some consistent method to make them manifest . for this purpose",
    "one usually works in the well - established framework of @xmath38 dimensional regularization ( dreg ) , which immediately leads to complications in the polarized case since both @xmath0 and the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath113 in ( [ eq : polgluon ] ) and ( [ eq : polquark ] ) are genuine _ four _ dimensional and have no straightforward continuation to @xmath114 dimensions dimensions",
    ". however , extra counterterms have to be introduced to match the uv sectors of dreg and dred @xcite .",
    "once this is done dreg and dred are simply related by a factorization scheme transformation @xcite . ] . since the use of a naive anticommuting @xmath0 in @xmath38 dimensions is known to lead to algebraic inconsistencies @xcite , one usually chooses to work in the hvbm scheme @xcite , which was shown to be internally consistent in @xmath38 dimensions , and its peculiarities will be briefly reviewed below .",
    "alternatively one can stick to an anticommuting @xmath0 by abandoning the cyclicity of trace @xcite . in this scheme a ` reading point '",
    "has to be defined from where _ all _ dirac traces of a given process have to be started which can be a quite cumbersome procedure .",
    "another prescription was suggested to handle traces with one @xmath0 @xcite by utilizing @xmath115 and contracting the resulting levi - civita tensors in @xmath38 dimensions .",
    "this avoids @xmath116 dimensional scalar productions which show up in the hvbm scheme but results in more complicated trace calculations .",
    "needless to say that in the end all consistent prescriptions should give the same result when used appropriately .    in the hvbm scheme",
    "@xcite the four dimensional definition for @xmath0 is maintained , and the @xmath117-tensor is regarded as a genuinely four dimensional object . in this way",
    "the @xmath38 dimensional space is splitted up into a four and a @xmath116 dimensional subspace , and @xmath116 dimensional scalar products ( ` _ hat momenta _ ' ) can show up in @xmath110 apart from their usual @xmath38 dimensional counterparts ( i.e. , mandelstam variables ) . for single inclusive jet or heavy quark production , e.g.",
    ", one can choose a convenient frame where all non - vanishing @xmath116 dimensional scalar products can be expressed by a single hat momenta combination @xmath118 .",
    "these terms deserve special attention when performing the @xmath119 phase space integrations since the @xmath116 dimensional subspace can not be integrated out trivially as in any unpolarized calculation .",
    "however , the modified phase space can be conveniently written as @xmath120 such that it reduces to the well - known ` unpolarized ' phase space formula @xmath121 for the vast majority of terms in the matrix element which do not depend on @xmath118 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the remaining calculation is then standard and proceeds in the same way as for any unpolarized cross section with one further crucial exception concerning the factorization of mass singularities .",
    "it was observed @xcite that the lo polarized splitting function in @xmath100 dimensions in the hvbm prescription , @xmath122 , is no longer equal to its unpolarized counterpart , i.e. , it violates helicity conservation , @xmath123 .",
    "this unwanted property has to be accounted for by an additional factorization scheme transformation whenever a pole @xmath124 has to be subtracted @xcite .",
    "when talking about the @xmath49 scheme in the polarized case in connection with the hvbm prescription , it is always understood that this additional transformation is already done .       for different bins in @xmath125 using the two scenarios for @xmath24 as described in the text and the lo grsv distributions @xcite for @xmath126 .",

    "let us finally focus on some recent phenomenological results .",
    "the complete nlo qcd corrections for jet production in polarized @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite collisions have become available recently in form of mc codes which allow to study all relevant differential jet distributions .",
    "the photoproduction of jets at a polarized hera is known to be an excellent tool to extract first information on the photonic densities @xmath24 by experimentally enriching that part of the cross section that stems from ` resolved ' photons @xcite .",

    "very encouraging results were found in @xcite , and it was shown that the lo qcd parton level calculations nicely agree with ` real ' jet production processes including initial and final state qcd radiation as well as non - perturbative effects such as hadronization , as modeled using the spin dependent sphinx mc @xcite .",
