    "cluster states are highly entangled multipartite states that have attracted much interest since they were proposed by raussendorf and briegel  @xcite as a resource state with potential applications for one - way quantum computing . however , as with conventional approaches , issues of scalability arise  @xcite .",

    "the experimental scheme was shown to be scalable and capable of simultaneously generating 15 quadripartite entangled cluster states . in previous work with others",
    "@xcite , we verified the presence of quadripartite entanglement in such a system by demonstrating violations of the van loock - furusawa ( vlf ) criteria  @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the squeezed joint quadrature operators in the temporal domain to determine whether the state produced could be classified as a cluster state .    in this brief report ,",
    "we investigate the squeezed joint quadrature operators in the frequency domain as this is the form more amenable to comparison with experiment .",
    "a spectral analysis of the system is required as the temporal domain solutions give the squeezing integrated over all frequencies and are not useful when we wish to know for which frequencies the system will be most useful . by verifying that the squeezed joint quadrature operators approach very low noise levels at particular frequencies , we determine that the scheme approaches an ideal cluster state .",

    "section ii provides details of the theoretical model and method .",

    "a summary of our findings is given in sec .",
    "the system considered here is a pumped optical cavity containing a @xmath0 non - linear crystal , as investigated theoretically in ref .",
    "we extend our analysis to incorporate the results of a full spectral analysis in the frequency domain .",

    "we note here that we are using the full interaction hamiltonian rather than making a classical undepleted pump approximation leading to linear heisenberg equations as used by pysher _",

    "the vertices represent the intracavity modes , the edges represent the coupling between these and fractions are the weightings.,scaledwidth=15.0% ]      we use the positive-@xmath21 representation  @xcite equations for the system described in sec .",
    "these are derived using the standard approach  @xcite whereby the master equation is mapped onto a fokker - planck equation for the positive-@xmath21 function using a correspondence between two independent stochastic fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the mode operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the resulting equations can then be written as a set of @xmath24-number stochastic differential equations .",
    "this method allows us to calculate classical stochastic averages which are equivalent to quantum mechanical normally - ordered operator moments .",
    "the positive-@xmath21 equations for the high frequency fields are @xmath25    and for the low frequency fields we find @xmath26 since the phase - space is doubled there are also the equations found by swapping @xmath22 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath28 are real , independent , gaussian noise terms with correlations @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "( [ posp ] ) with the classical steady - state values inserted , @xmath38 is a vector of wiener increments  @xcite and @xmath39 is the drift matrix with the classical steady - state values inserted .",
    "provided that the eigenvalues of the drift matrix @xmath39 have no negative real part , the system is well described as a multi - variable ornstein - uhlenbeck process  @xcite , for which the intracavity spectral correlation matrix is found as a matrix product which is then related to the measurable output fluctuation spectra by the standard input - output relations  @xcite .",
    "we now calculate the spectral variances of the squeezed joint operators and confirm that these approach zero over a range of phases and frequencies .",
    "we consider the symmetric system where the two pumping inputs , @xmath40 , are equal , the two nonlinearities , @xmath41 are equal , and the cavity losses , @xmath42 , are equal . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the system has an oscillation threshold and for the parameters used here the critical pump amplitude is @xmath43 .",
    "the parameters used in the following calculations are @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , giving a pump rate approximately 12% below threshold in intensity . for these parameters ,",
    "this was found to yield the best squeezing .    in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we plot the minimum variance of the squeezed joint operators , @xmath47 , as a function of the phase at a fixed frequency .",
    "we find the frequency at which the minimum variance is obtained and plot all four variances at this corresponding frequency . specifically , fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] represents the maximum squeezing achieved by the operators @xmath48 but not @xmath49 .",
    "the frequency that yields the maximum squeezing corresponds to @xmath50 0.35@xmath51 , corresponding to 30 mhz with a cavity loss rate 80 mhz .",
    "we find that @xmath52 , as indicated by the ( green ) solid line , and @xmath53 , as indicated by the ( blue ) dashed line .",
    "the corresponding flat lines indicate the coherent state level for the variances of the particular quadrature combinations , the dashed line being at 7.24 and the solid line at 2.76 .",
    "this result shows squeezing well below the coherent state level and identifies a region where the squeezed joint operators approach zero for a range of phases centered around @xmath54 and multiples of @xmath55 .",
    "this provides a theoretical quantum treatment of the experimental results obtained in ref .",

    "this plot compares well to the experimental results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite with the width of the squeezing region becoming smaller as the degree of squeezing increases .",
    "the squeezed joint operators are scaled relative to the relevant coherent state level of zero .",
    "0.35@xmath51.,scaledwidth=45.1% ]    we also investigate the behavior of the squeezed joint operators over a range of frequencies .",
    "figures  [ figure5 ] and  [ figure6 ] show plots of the minimum variances as a function of both frequency and phase .",
    "the range of parameters over which the entangled state can be considered as approximately a four mode cluster state can be seen in the smooth region surrounding @xmath54 and where @xmath56 .",
    "in both fig .  [ figure5 ] and fig .  [ figure6 ]",
    "the functions are cropped at @xmath57 to improve visualization .     and",
    "@xmath58 , as a function of phase and frequency.,scaledwidth=45.1% ]     and @xmath59 , as a function of phase and frequency.,scaledwidth=45.1% ]    finally , we consider the regime of optimal squeezing for the joint operators .",
    "figure  [ figure7 ] shows the minimum of the sum of the variances of both squeezed joint operator pairs as a function of phase on a logarithmic scale .",
    "although this compromises the overall degree of squeezing obtained , this regime may be of use in experiments as the corresponding frequency of @xmath50 0.23@xmath51 yields the best possible degree of squeezing for the combined quadratures .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the requirements of a cv four mode cluster state are closely satisfied in the single opo scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and experimentally realized in ref .",
    "this is verified by confirming that the squeezed joint quadrature operators for the system approach zero for a range of phases and frequencies .",

    "this work builds on our previous findings in ref .",
    "@xcite wherein cv quadripartite entanglement was demonstrated in the system and the squeezed joint quadrature operators were calculated in the temporal domain .",
    "using our approach , it is a simple matter to extend the analysis to parameter regimes above the oscillation threshhold , which may have advantages when photon flux is important .",
