    "nonclassical gaussian states play an important role in quantum information processing with continuous variables , such as teleportation , dense coding , and quantum cloning . in a quantum optics laboratory , gaussian states",
    "have been generated but there is some  limitation in using them for various tasks of quantum information procession @xcite .",
    "for example , when a two - mode squeezed vacuum state ( a gaussian state ) with low squeezing is used as an entangled resource to realize quantum teleportation , the average fidelity is just more @xmath7 than the classical limits . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to generate and manipulate various nonclassical optical fields by subtracting or adding photons from / to traditional quantum states or gaussian states , which are useful ways to conditionally manipulate nonclassical state of optical field @xcite .",
    "recently , subtracting or adding photon states have received more attention from both experimentalists and theoreticians @xcite .",
    "one of reasons is that photon subtraction can be applied to improve entanglement between gaussian states @xcite , loophole - free tests of bell s inequality @xcite , and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "thus the photon subtraction ( a non - gaussian operation ) can satisfy the requirement of quantum information protocols for long - distance communication .",
    "nevertheless , the photon addition and subtraction have been successfully demonstrated experimentally for probing quantum commutation rules by parigi",
    "_ et al_. @xcite .",
    "in fact , they have implemented simple alternated sequences of photon creation ( addition ) and annihilation ( subtraction ) on a thermal field and observed the noncommutativity of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "in addition , olivares et al .",
    "@xcite theoretically discussed the relation between the photon subtracted squeezed vacuum ( pssv ) , as an output state passing through a beamsplitter , and two parameters ( the transmissivity of beamsplitter and the photodetection quantum efficiency ) .",
    "then the case of two - mode photon - subtraction is also further discussed in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "kitagawa et al @xcite investigated the degree of entanglement for non - gaussian mixed ( pure ) states generated by photon subtraction from two - mode squeezed vacuum states with on - off photon detectors .",
    "for the single pssv , furthermore , its nonclassical properties and decoherence was investigated theoretically in two different decoherent channels ( amplitude decay and phase damping ) by biswas and agarwal @xcite .",
    "they indicated that the wf losses its non - gaussian nature and becomes gaussian at long times in amplitude decay case .",
    "recently , it is found that consecutive applications of photon subtraction ( or subtracting a well - defined number of photons ) from a squeezed vacuum state result in the generation of a squeezed superpositions of coherent state ( sscs ) with nearly the perfect fidelity regardless of the number of photons subtracted @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the sscs increases as the number of the subtracted photons gets larger .",
    "it is interesting in noticing that single - mode displaced - squeezed thermal state can be considered as a generalized gaussian state , which has received more attention @xcite .",
    "for example , phase estimations for squeezed thermal states ( stss ) and displaced thermal states are presented @xcite , which shows that a larger temperature can enhance the estimation fidelity for the former .",
    "another example is , for gaussian squeezed states of light , that a scheme is also presented experimentally to measure its squeezing , purity and entanglement @xcite . to our knowledge , however , the investigation of photon subtraction from sts ( even for single photon subtraction case ) has not been previously addressed ( especially when this state interacts with its surrounding environment ) .",
    "in addition , the exact threshold value of the decay time has not been explicity given . * * in this paper , we focus on any number photon - subtracted single - mode sts ( pssts ) , which is optically produced single - mode non - gaussian states , and explore theoretically its nonclassical properties and decoherence in a thermal channel by deriving analytically some expressions , such as normalized constant , photon - number distribution and wigner function ( wf ) . for single pssts",

    "ii , we introduce the single - mode pssts , where the normalized factor turns out to be a legendre polynomial with a remarkable result . in sec .",
    "iii , the nonclassical properties of the pssts , such as mandel s @xmath8-parameter , and distribution of photon number ( related to a legendre polynomial ) , are calculated analytically and then be discussed in details . in sec .",
    "iv , the explicitly analytical expressions of quasiprobability distributions for pssts , such as p - distribution , q - function and wf of the pssts , are derived by using the weyl ordered operators invariance under a similar transformations .",
    "then we derive an explicitly analytical expression of time evolution of wf for the arbitrary pssts in the thermal channel and discuss the loss of nonclassicality in reference of the negativity of wf in sec .",
    "v. it is found that the threshold value of decay time corresponding to the transition of wf from partial negative to completely positive definite is obtained at the center of the phase space , which is not only dependent on the average number @xmath5 of environment , but also on @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
