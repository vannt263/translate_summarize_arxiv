    "massive black holes ( bhs ) at the centers of galaxies are recognized as a normal , perhaps ubiquitous , component of elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; barth 2004 ; kormendy 2004 ) .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that all hot galaxy components ( elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges ) contain central bhs ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "also , a good correlation has been shown to exist between the mass of supermassive bhs , @xmath1 , and host galaxy mass or luminosity ( kormendy 1993 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .   1998 ;",
    "marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . a plausible physical framework to discuss the connections between bh mass , galaxy formation , and quasar evolution was outlined by richstone et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . over the lifetime of hst",
    ", the set of galaxies with reliable bh masses has grown rapidly , culminating in the discovery of a relation between the mass of bhs and the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge / spheroid , @xmath2 ( gebhardt et al .  2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "since the discovery of this @xmath1-@xmath2 relation , measurement of lower mass bhs have been made , extending mass estimates as low as @xmath3 ( barth et al .  2004 , 2005 ;",
    "fillipenko & ho 2003 ; greene & ho 2004 ) and as high as @xmath4 ( e.g. , tremaine et al .",
    "this has also allowed investigations of other galaxy properties that correlate well with @xmath1 , such as bulge light concentration or srsic index ( e.g. , graham & driver 2007 ) and bulge gravitational binding energy ( aller & richstone 2007 ) .    the recent discovery of supermassive bhs in the centers of late - type galaxies with little or no bulge ( satyapal et al",
    ".  2007 , 2008 ) suggests that one of the mechanisms for determining the size ( or mass ) of centrals bhs may be linked to the concentration or virial mass of the dark matter halo .",
    "this is in agreement with ferrarese ( 2002 ) , who finds that the mass of the dark matter halo is linked to bh mass , by comparing maximum rotation velocities , @xmath5 , of disk galaxies with their corrected central velocity dispersion and finding a good correlation .",
    "generally , it can be stated that galaxies with larger bulges tend to be found in more massive dark matter halos , but this relationship , while being a good correlation _ on average _ , has a lot of scatter ( see , e.g. , ho 2007 ) .",
    "since spiral arm pitch angle also depends on mass concentration , once again this may point to a relation between spiral arm pitch angle and bh mass .",
    "such a relation may be important , as it could possibly be an indirect means of determining the masses of supermassive bhs in distant disk galaxies , and hence the growth of bhs in spirals as a function of look back time .",
    "the range of supermassive bhs in spirals is less than the entire observed range of masses for all galaxy types . for spirals ,",
    "bh masses typically range from @xmath6 ( similar to the milky way galaxy ; ghez et al .  2005 ; genzel et al .",
    "2000 ) to @xmath7 ( for more massive spiral galaxies like m31 ; e.g. , bender et al .  2005 ) . in this letter",
    "we show that a correlation exists between supermassive bh mass and spiral arm pitch angle ( a measure of the tightness or looseness of spiral arms in disk galaxies ) .",
    "our sample consists of a total of 27 spiral galaxies with bh masses that have been determined using several different methods .",
    "the first 12 galaxies have estimates of their supermassive bhs using direct determinations .",
    "the next 11 galaxies were selected from the sample of ferrarese ( 2002 ) and the bh masses have been determined using the central velocity dispersion of the bulge , @xmath2 , and converting to bh mass using the relation from ferrarese ( 2002 ) .",
    "the last 4 galaxies have lower limits for the bh masses based upon the eddington limit and have been taken from the sample of satyapal et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "it should be noted that these lower limits are order of magnitude estimates at best .",
    "our galaxies consist of those galaxies with known bh masses , with hubble types ranging from sa to sm , for which it is possible to measure spiral arm pitch angle .",

    "images of 25 of these galaxies were then downloaded from various archives , also listed in table 1 .",
    "the images were then used to determine spiral arm pitch angles ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the remaining 2 galaxies are the milky way and m31 , for which spiral arm pitch angles were taken from the literature .",
    "levine et al .  ( 2006 ) measure the spiral arm pitch angle of the milky as @xmath77 from neutral hydrogen observations . for m31 , arp ( 1964 ) measured a pitch angle @xmath78 and braun ( 1991 ) measured a pitch angle @xmath79 .",
    "here we adopt the average of these two measurements for the spiral arm pitch angle of m31 .",
    "the remaining spiral arm pitch angles were measured using a two - dimensional fast fourier transformation ( schrder et al .",
    "1994 ) , assuming logarithmic spirals .",
    "the range of radii over which the fourier fits were applied were selected to exclude the bulge or bar ( where no information about the arms exists ) and to extend out to the outer limits of the arms in our images .",
    "pitch angles were then determined from peaks in the fourier spectra , as this is the most powerful method to find periodicity in a distribution ( considre & athanassoula 1988 ; garcia - gomez & athanassoula 1993 ) .",
    "the radial range over which the fourier analysis was performed was chosen by eye and is probably the dominant source of error in the calculation of pitch angles . as a result",
    ", three radial ranges were chosen for each galaxy , and a mean pitch angle and standard error calculated for every object .",
    "the images were first deprojected to face - on .",
    "mean uncertainties of position angle and inclination as a function of inclination were discussed by considre & athanassoula ( 1988 ) . for a galaxy with low inclination",
    ", there are clearly greater uncertainties in assigning both a position angle and an accurate inclination .",
    "these uncertainties are discussed by block et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who take a galaxy with low inclination ( @xmath80 ) and one with high inclination ( @xmath81 ) and vary the inclination angle used in the correction to face - on .",
    "they find that for the galaxy with low inclination , the measured pitch angle remains the same .",
    "however , the measured pitch angle for the galaxy with high inclination varies by 10% . for galaxies with inclination",
    "@xmath82 we take into account this uncertainty .",
    "our deprojection method assumes that spiral galaxy disks are intrinsically circular .",
    "figure 1 shows a plot of supermassive bh mass versus spiral arm pitch angle .",
    "as expected , we find a good correlation between bh mass and pitch angle .",
    "pearson s linear correlation coefficient is 0.95 and the significance level at which the null hypothesis of zero correlation is disproved is 3@xmath83 .",
    "this means that the masses of bhs in the nuclei of disk galaxies can be determined directly from a measurement of their spiral arm morphology , in particular the spiral arm pitch angle .",
    "the relationship shown in figure 1 can be explained as follows .",
    "it has been shown that spiral arm pitch angle is related to the rotation curve shear of disk galaxies ( seigar , block & puerari 2004 ; seigar et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the rotation curve shear is a measure of the slope of the rotation curve and is therefore directly related to the overall mass concentration ( see seigar et al .",
    "2006 for a definition of rotation curve shear ) . furthermore , the recent discovery of agn in late - type bulgeless galaxies ( satyapal et al",
    ".  2007 , 2008 ) suggests that bh mass may be more closely related to mass concentration than bulge mass .",
    "satyapal et al .  (",
    "2008 ) suggest that the dark matter halo virial mass ( which is related to the dark matter halo concentration ; see e.g. , van den bosch et al.2007 ) is the key quantity in determining bh mass . because the bh mass and spiral arm pitch angle are both related to mass concentration , it is no surprise that we find that they are related to each other .",
    "however , it should be noted that to truly determine if mass concentration is the main determinant of bh mass is the subject of a more detailed study .      for galaxies with the most open spiral structure ( with pitch angles @xmath84 )",
    "the slope in the relationship appears to change sharply .",
    "the most open spiral structure in disk galaxies has typical pitch angles between 40@xmath85 and 45@xmath85 ( e.g. , seigar & james 1998 ; block et al .",
    "these galaxies have small bulges , if any bulge at all ( kennicutt 1981 ; de jong 1996 ; seigar & james 1998 ) . as a result",
    "the bh masses in galaxies with very open spiral arms may very quickly approach zero . in this study ,",
    "the galaxy with the most open spiral structure is m33 , with a pitch angle , @xmath86 .",
    "this galaxy has a hubble classification of sacd , and is often referred to as being a bulgeless galaxy ( e.g. , stephens & frogel 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has the lowest measured mass of any nuclear bh ever measured , with an upper limit of 1500 @xmath87 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "if these bulgeless galaxies have nuclear bh masses that are very low , or possibly approaching zero , the sharp change in the slope of the relation above pitch angles of 40@xmath85 is probably due to a cut - off in the expected range of black hole masses for disk galaxies .",
    "it should also be noted , that this change in slope is currently driven by just 5 galaxies with pitch angles , @xmath88 .",
    "if a larger sample were available it may be demonstrated that the correlation simply breaks down for galaxies with the most open spiral structure .",
    "for this reason we have used a linear relation to describe galaxies with pitch angles @xmath89 ( figure 1 ; dashed line ) .",
    "the equation of this line is , @xmath90    the smallest pitch angles typically seen are in the range @xmath91 ( block et al .",
    "1999 ; seigar 2005 ) .",
    "such galaxies have the largest bulges and subsequently the most massive nuclear bhs ( for spirals ) .",
    "the galaxy with the largest black hole in this study is m31 , with a mass of @xmath92 ( bender et al .",
    "m31 is classified as sab , but it is likely mis - classified due to its high inclination , and most likely has a larger bulge and/or bar ( e.g. , beaton et al .",
    "2007 ) .    assuming that the break in the relation between smbh mass and spiral arm pitch angle in figure 1 is real , we have also used a double power - law model ( similar to the nuker law of lauer et al .  1995 ) to describe the relation ( figure 1 ; solid line ) .",
    "such a model is written : @xmath93^{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma-\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right)}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 measures the slope of the power law for low pitch angles , @xmath95 is the slope of the power law for large pitch angles , @xmath96 is the transition from low pitch angles to high pitch angles , @xmath97 governs the sharpness of the transition and @xmath98 is the black hole mass for a pitch angle @xmath96 .",
    "the solid line in figure 1 is the best fitting model described by equation 2 .",
    "the scatter with respect to this best - fit is 0.3 dex .",
    "for the best fit we find values for the parameters , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "also , it can be seen that as the pitch angle approaches zero , that the black hole mass increases rapidly .",
    "however , it should be noted that the relationship only applies to spiral galaxies , and is therefore not applicable below pitch angles of @xmath104 , i.e. similar to the pitch angle of m31 , since this is the tighest pitch angle typically seen in disk galaxies .    in figure 2",
    "we show a plot of bulge central velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , as a function of spiral arm pitch angle .",
    "not surprisingly , a good correlation is seen .",
    "this is simply a result of the fact that @xmath2 is also an indicator of the mass of central bhs ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . in this case ,",
    "pearson s linear correlation coefficient is 0.92 and the significance level at which the null hypothesis of zero correlation is disproved is also 3@xmath83 .",
    "we suggest that two of the factors in the determination of supermassive bh mass could be either dark matter halo concentration ( @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the virial radius and @xmath107 is the dark matter density profile scale radius ; navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) or the dark matter halo virial mass ( see ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "one of the determining factors of spiral arm pitch angle is central mass concentration , which in turn is related to dark matter halo concentration ( e.g. , seigar et al .",
    ". furthermore , spiral galaxies with larger halo concentrations are more likely to have larger stellar bulges in which more massive bhs can reside .",
    "finally , the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge , @xmath83 , is an indicator of the dynamical mass within the radius at which it is measured .",
    "this is also related to halo concentration , which in turn is related to halo virial mass ( e.g. , van den bosch et al .",
    "it is therefore possible not only to explain the relationship between spiral arm pitch angle and supermassive bh mass ( presented here ) , but also the relation between bulge mass and supermassive bh mass ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) and the @xmath108-@xmath83 relation ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "however , we note that given the current evidence , it is impossible to tell if dark matter halo concentration is the main determinant of supermassive bh mass , or if some other quanitity is also important . to determine",
    "if the dark matter halo does affect bh mass is the subject of a more detailed study .    finally , the importance of the relationship between spiral arm pitch angle and supermassive bh mass lies in the ability to detect regular spiral structure out to intermediate redshifts .",
    "for example , elmegreen et al .  (",
    "2004 ) clearly show that disk galaxies at @xmath0 can exhibit grand design spiral structure",
    ". if this is true , then it may be possible to estimate the growth of supermassive bhs in disk galaxies as a function of look back time , just from imaging data and a measurement of spiral arm pitch angle .",
    "in such a study , the accuracy for predicting the bh mass for an individual galaxy is @xmath10930% , based on the scatter in figure 1 and the typical errors associated with estimating spiral arm pitch angles .",
    "taking into account that spiral arm pitch angles for more distant galaxies will be measured with less certainty , it is likely that we will be able to determine bh masses to within @xmath10950% .",
    "it is therefore important to note that the spiral arm pitch angle versus bh mass relation should be applied to a large sample of nearly face - on galaxies , in which case a statistical analysis of the evolution of bh masses in disk galaxies can be determined .",
    "given the quantity of deep hst imaging of blank fields that is now available , it seems that the time is ripe to perform such as study .",
    "for example , we estimate that @xmath110700 galaxies are available for a study of spiral structure from the great observatories origins deep survey fields alone ( see giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 for a description of this survey ) .",
    "it therefore should now be possible to determine , statistically , the evolution of smbhs in disk galaxies , based upon spiral arm morphology .",
    "support for this work was provided by the arkansas nasa epscor program .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with nasa .",
