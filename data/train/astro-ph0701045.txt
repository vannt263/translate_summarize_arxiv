    "searches for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) have measured their luminosity functions out to high redshifts ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that substantial numbers of galaxies were in place at z=6 , and that galaxy formation must be ongoing at higher redshifts . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that the existing mass in @xmath8-dropouts at @xmath9 can not be assembled unless star formation rates were higher in the past .",
    "the implied rapid first bursts of star formation at @xmath10 could produce galaxies with large enough rest - wavelength uv luminosities to be detected in the near infrared .",
    "in addition , it is currently uncertain if the the amount of star formation at @xmath9 is adequate to reionize the universe .",
    "j - dropout lbgs may play an important role in this process , which is likely between @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the nicmos parallel imaging survey ( @xcite ; henry et al . in prep ) , provides the unique combination of sensitivity and wide area coverage required to find rare , luminous lbgs with @xmath12 . with 135 arcminutes@xmath13 in 228 independent sight lines ,",
    "we cover an order of magnitude more sky than the nicmos portions of hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the ultra deep field ( udf ; @xcite ) . although the nicmos parallel imaging survey is less sensitive than these surveys , the galaxies presented here are better suited for follow - up observations .",
    "in addition , it surpasses most ground based imaging .",
    "we have identified a sample of possible j - dropout galaxies from the nicmos parallel survey , and here we discuss the likelihood that any of them are at @xmath14 , as well as the possible implications for star formation near the epoch of reionization .",
    "we use @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , and ab magnitudes are used throughout .",
    "we take @xmath18 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "we conducted the nicmos parallel survey in _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observing cycles 7 , 11 , 12 , and 13 .",
    "images and slitless grism spectroscopy were obtained in the parallel mode , using the nicmos 3 camera @xcite .",
    "early results from the cycle 7 survey are presented in @xcite , yan et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ) , and @xcite .",
    "the cycles 11 , 12 , and 13 imaging data will be described in more detail in henry et al .",
    "( in prep ) ; we provide a summary here . each field",
    "was observed with both the @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) filters , with average integration times of @xmath251500  s and @xmath252000  s. images are drizzled according to @xcite , and the resulting point spread function has a fwhm @xmath26 .",
    "photometry was performed with sextractor @xcite in dual image mode .",
    "the @xmath23 images were used to detect sources , and fluxes were measured from identical @xcite apertures in both bands .",
    "we require 9 pixels above 1.5@xmath27 for detection .",
    "we further require a 5@xmath27 detection in @xmath23 , as measured in a 0.8 diameter aperture .",
    "the average 5@xmath27 sensitivities reached are j@xmath28 = 25.8 and h@xmath29 = 25.6 .",
    "we detect 7700 objects ; the color magnitude diagram is shown in figure [ cmd ] ( left ) .      in figure [ cmd ] ( right )",
    "we show @xcite evolutionary tracks to which we have added an igm foreground absorption component which is completely opaque beyond @xmath9 , where ly@xmath30 passes into the @xmath21 filter .",
    "in addition , we show examples of two local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , arp 220 , and iras 03521 + 0028 . for arp 220",
    "we compile the uv to near infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from @xcite , @xcite , and the rc3 catalog . for iras 03521 + 0028 , which has a very red rest frame",
    "optical sed , only the bihk photometry from @xcite is available , so we do not extend this track beyond @xmath31 .    to minimize contamination from lower redshift interlopers ,",
    "we adopt the color selection @xmath32 for j - dropout candidates .",
    "figure [ cmd ] ( right ) shows that the reddest j - dropout lbgs will be selected at @xmath33 , while nearly all models meet this criterion at @xmath34 .",
    "we find 14 j - dropout candidates ( table [ table ] ) ; five are detected in @xmath21 ( at @xmath35 or better ) , but this does not disqualify them as lbgs , since some flux will fall in the @xmath21 filter for @xmath36 .",
    "the remaining nine galaxies are among the sources which are plotted as lower limits ( upward pointing arrows ) in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "possible contamination from lower redshift sources is discussed in  [ interlopers ] .    since exposure times varied from field to field ,",
    "the nicmos parallel survey is inhomogeneous in sensitivity . for selection of red galaxies , the faint limit of the sample",
    "is determined by the sensitivity in the @xmath21 images .",
    "for example , at @xmath37 , 98% of the @xmath21 images have sufficient sensitivity for sources to be selected with @xmath0 . a half magnitude fainter , at @xmath38 , this completeness drops to @xmath39% .",
    "since fainter galaxies are more likely to be genuine j - dropout lbgs , we consider all galaxies with @xmath40 , and correct for this incompleteness .",
    "figure [ cmd ] ( right ) shows that some lower redshift galaxies may be selected as j - dropout candidates .",
    "@xcite find three galaxies with @xmath0 in a 15 arcmin@xmath41 survey .",
    "this density is consistent with the 14 sources we have found , since the nicmos parallel imaging survey covers ten times the area of bouwens et al . , although with less sensitivity .",
    "bouwens et al . use optical and k - band photometry to argue that these galaxies are all at lower redshift . since they find no j - dropout lbgs with @xmath0 , the implied density is less than 250 degree@xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we consider the seds of two local ulirgs . @xcite have shown that ulirgs have a surface density of about @xmath43 at @xmath44 . for arp 220 ( @xmath45 ) , we expect @xmath46 at @xmath31 , which is typical of the galaxies in this survey . however , ulirgs like arp 220 are not red enough at @xmath44 to be selected as part of this sample . in figure [ cmd ]",
    "( right ) we show the predicted color of another ulirg , iras 03521 + 0028 , which has a very red rest frame optical sed .",
    "this galaxy is red enough to be selected at @xmath31 , but it is doubtful if many ulirgs at @xmath44 can be described by this red optical sed . if @xmath2510% display similar colors , this could account for the 14 j - dropout candidates . while galaxies like arp 220 could also be selected by our color cut at @xmath47 , ulirgs at these redshifts",
    "are expected to be rare , and would have to be very luminous , with @xmath48 . even at @xmath44 , the density of ulirgs of this luminosity is low , with only @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "since no objects have ever been confirmed at less than 500 myrs after the big bang , it is difficult to predict how bright or numerous they will be . since small uncertainties in @xmath5",
    "can have a large effect , we consider both a schecter luminosity function ( lf ) , and a broken power law of the form : @xmath52 with faint end slope @xmath53 and luminous slope @xmath54 . in figure",
    "[ lfcontour ] , we show contours in surface density , calculated by integrating the luminosity function for a range of plausible @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 this allows for the dimming of @xmath58 with redshift , which is large for @xmath59 , where the ly@xmath30 absorption passes into the @xmath23 filter .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is the comoving volume element , and @xmath61 corrects for galaxies which are missed because of incompleteness , or because they are not red enough to be selected by our color cut . to estimate @xmath61 , we separate the quantity into @xmath62 , taking @xmath63 as the completeness which we discussed in  [ sample ] . for @xmath64",
    ", we assume that galaxies are equally distributed between the reddest and bluest models in figure [ cmd ] ( right ) , so that @xmath64 increases from zero to one between @xmath65 . under these assumptions",
    ", the galaxies in this survey should lie between @xmath12 , with an average redshift of between @xmath66 , depending on the chosen lf .",
    "we therefore adopt an average redshift of @xmath20 .",
    "we repeat this calculation to estimate a constraint on the lf based on the upper limit in surface density found in the @xcite search for j - dropouts , which consists of six fields imaged to an average sensitivity of @xmath67 . like the nicmos parallel survey ,",
    "the @xcite survey is limited by sensitivity in @xmath21 , so that galaxies with @xmath0 are only selected down to @xmath68 .",
    "their finding of less than 250 degree@xmath42 is plotted as the dot - dashed line in figure [ lfcontour ] . also , for comparison to more sensitive surveys , we show surface densities calculated with @xmath69 and a detection limit of @xmath70 ( this requires a sensitivity of @xmath71 , which can be reached in less than 10 hours of integration with the _ james webb space telescope _ ) .",
    "these plots show the expected density of j - dropout lbgs , based on a given @xmath72 and @xmath55 .",
    "the shaded area of figure [ lfcontour ] shows the allowed region for @xmath72 and @xmath55 if 1 - 10 j - dropout lbgs exist in this survey .",
    "if none of the candidates are @xmath73 lbgs , then @xmath72 and @xmath55 should be below the shaded region .",
    "we show examples from a few observed lfs , including the broken power law fits which we made .",
    "if the @xmath9 measurement by @xcite is a good indicator of the population at @xmath74 , then the density of sources which we expect is of order @xmath75 in the schecter form , and about @xmath76 in the broken power law lf .",
    "these densities are too low to suggest any j - dropout lbgs in the nicmos parallel survey , which covers only 0.04 @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite , in a lensing survey for j - dropout galaxies , find that the @xmath78 lf may be more like the @xmath79 lf by @xcite . in this case , the chances of finding a j - dropout lbg in the nicmos parallel survey are better , with about 1 - 10 @xmath80 in both the schecter and broken power law forms .",
    "the lf constraint which we estimated from the absence of j - dropout galaxies with @xmath0 in the @xcite survey suggests they are too few and too faint for any to be found in the nicmos parallel survey .",
    "however , bouwens et al .",
    "survey only a small volume for rare objects , and so the cosmic variance will be large . alternatively ,",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite show that to produce the observed mass density at @xmath9 , the progenitors at @xmath10 must have formed stars more rapidly in the past .",
    "the magnitude of this brightening is uncertain , but @xcite suggest it is a factor of a few .",
    "we show this inferred lf , as two times brighter than the @xmath9 measurement by @xcite , with no density evolution . this predicted lf is similar to the measurement by @xcite , again , suggesting that we expect , at best , a 40% chance of finding a j - dropout lbg .",
    "if the brightening in the lf is instead a factor of four larger than at @xmath9 , then we can expect one or two j - dropout lbgs .",
    "in addition , we find that more than a factor of ten increase in @xmath81 ( with no density evolution ) is unlikely , since we would then expect more than 16 galaxies with @xmath0 in this survey .",
    "j - dropout galaxies may play an important role in the reionization of the universe .",
    "the critical star formation rate density ( @xmath82 ) required to ionize the universe , is @xmath83 @xcite , if all ionizing photons escape the galaxies , and the clumping factor of ionized hydrogen is 30 .",
    "these parameters are uncertain , but this is much larger than the upper limit posed by @xcite for galaxies at @xmath84 .",
    "alternatively , for the lf which predicts a few j - dropout lbgs in this survey , where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , we calculate @xmath87 in both the schecter and broken power law forms . in this case",
    ", j - dropout lbgs may be capable of reionizing the universe , although the uncertainties in the escape fraction of ionizing photons , and the clumping factor of ionized hydrogen must be addressed .    to conclude , it is not implausible that @xmath82 is very large during the first few hundred million years of galaxy formation if stars were formed in rapid bursts .",
    "in fact , cofirmation of any j - dropout galaxies will suggest a large @xmath82 for most reasonable @xmath56 .",
    "follow - up observations of the galaxies presented here is one way to constrain star formation at @xmath51 .",
