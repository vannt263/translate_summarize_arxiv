    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics surmises on the minimal choice that a single higgs doublet provides masses to all particles . some questions however remain unanswered , including the origins of neutrino mass and dark matter ( dm ) , keeping other avenues open for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "there have been several conclusive evidences in the last two decades which validate the existence of non - zero neutrino masses and large leptonic mixing @xcite .",
    "the present status of different neutrino parameters can be found in the latest global fit analysis @xcite .",
    "the sm can not address this observed phenomena simply because the neutrinos remain massless in the model .",
    "due to the absence of the right handed neutrino , the higgs field can not have any dirac yukawa coupling with the neutrinos .",
    "if the right handed neutrinos are included by hand , one needs the yukawa couplings to be heavily fine tuned to around @xmath4 in order to generate sub - ev neutrino masses from the same higgs field of the sm .",
    "one can generate a tiny majorana mass for the neutrinos from the same higgs field of the sm at non - renormalisable level through the dimension five weinberg operator @xcite .",
    "the realisation of this dimension five operator within renormalisable theories are also available in the literature , popularly known as the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "even if the tiny neutrino masses are generated dynamically within such seesaw frameworks , understanding the origin of the large leptonic mixing is another puzzle .",
    "since the quark sector mixing is observed to be small , it also indicates that there may be some new dynamics operating in the leptonic sector that generates the large mixing . as can be seen from the global fit data , out of the three leptonic mixing angles , the solar and atmospheric angles are reasonably large while the reactor mixing angle is relatively small .",
    "in fact , before the discovery of non - zero reactor mixing angle @xmath1 in 2012 , the neutrino data were consistent with a class of neutrino mass matrices obeying @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "this class of models predicts @xmath6 whereas the value of @xmath7 depends upon the particular model . out of different @xmath5 symmetric neutrino mass models ,",
    "the tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) mixing @xcite received lots of attention within several neutrino mass models .",
    "the tbm mixing predicts @xmath8 .",
    "such a mixing can be easily accommodated within popular discrete flavour symmetry models @xcite .",
    "since the measured value of @xmath1 is small , such @xmath5 symmetric models can still be considered to be valid at leading order , while the small but non - zero @xmath1 can be generated by perturbations to either the charged lepton or the neutrino sector , as studied in several works in the literature including @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the sm also fails to provide a particle dm candidate that can satisfy all the criteria of a good dm candidate @xcite .",
    "although there are enough evidences from astrophysics and cosmology suggesting the presence of dm , starting from the galaxy cluster observations by fritz zwicky @xcite back in 1933 , observations of galaxy rotation curves in 1970 s @xcite , the more recent observation of the bullet cluster @xcite to the latest cosmology data provided by the planck satellite @xcite , the particle nature of dm is not yet known .",
    "this has motivated the particle physics community to study different possible bsm frameworks which can give rise to the correct dm phenomenology and can also be tested at several different experiments . among them ,",
    "the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm is the most popular bsm scenario as the correct dm relic abundance can be achieved for such a particle if it has interaction strength similar to weak interactions .",
    "this coincidence is also referred to as the _ wimp miracle_. in terms of density parameter and @xmath9 , the present dark matter abundance is conventionally reported as @xcite @xmath10 using the measured value of hubble parameter , this gives rise to approximately @xmath11 of the total energy density of the present universe being made up of dm .",
    "the same planck experiment also puts an upper bound on the lightest neutrino mass from the measurement of the sum of absolute neutrino masses @xmath12",
    "ev @xcite .",
    "although the origin of neutrino mass as well as leptonic mixing may be unrelated to the fundamental origin of dm , it is highly motivating to look for a common framework that can explain both the phenomena .",
    "this not only keeps the bsm physics minimal , but also allows for its probe in a much wider range of experiments .",
    "we find two such frameworks very appealing : one where neutrino masses originate at one loop level with dm particles going in the loop @xcite and the other where the same discrete flavour symmetry responsible for generating large leptonic mixing also guarantees a stable dm candidate @xcite .",
    "more detailed phenomenology of similar models can be found in several works including @xcite .",
    "another recent proposal to connect dark mater with non - zero @xmath1 can be found in @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , here also we consider an inverse seesaw model @xcite based on @xmath0 discrete flavour symmetry that gives rise to tbm type neutrino mixing at leading order . unlike canonical seesaw models , the inverse seesaw can be a low scale framework without any fine tuning of yukawa couplings .",
    "this is possible due to softly broken global lepton number symmetry by the singlet mass term as we discuss later .",
    "another motivation to study this particular model is the neutrino mass sum rules it predicts , which relates the three light neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "this predicts the lightest neutrino mass , once the experimental data of two mass squared differences are given as input and hence can be probed at experiments sensitive to the lightest neutrino mass say , neutrinoless double beta decay ( ndbd ) .",
    "since the model gives rise to tbm mixing , disallowed by latest neutrino data , we extend the model in order to generate non - zero @xmath1 in such a way that automatically takes dm into account .",
    "for this we make use of the scotogenic mechanism @xcite mentioned above where dm particles going in loop can generate tiny neutrino mass .",
    "we implement this idea in two different ways .",
    "first we add a one loop correction to the leading order light neutrino mass matrix from inverse seesaw and secondly we give a similar correction to the charged lepton mass matrix . in both the cases ,",
    "the correct neutrino and dm phenomenology can be reproduced .",
    "however , the charged lepton correction is found to have advantage over the former due the fact that it does not disturb the mass sum rule prediction of the leading order model .",
    "also , one requires less fine - tuning to generate correction to charged lepton masses due to which the lepton portal limit of inert scalar dm can be achieved , which can give different dm phenomenology compared to the well studied higgs portal dm scenario , as we discuss later .    the work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : level2 ] we summarise the @xmath0 based inverse seesaw model at leading order along with its predictions . in section [ sec : level3 ] we explain the origin of non - zero reactor mixing angle and dark matter by extending the leading order model . in section [ sec : level4 ] we briefly discuss dm phenomenology of the model and then briefly comment upon neutrinoless double beta decay prediction in the context of the present model in section [ sec : level5 ] .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ sec : level6 ] and finally conclude in section [ sec : level7 ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review the inverse seesaw model and its @xmath0 realisation .",
    "the inverse seesaw model is an extension of the sm by two different types of singlet neutral fermions @xmath13 three copies each .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the sm higgs doublet and @xmath16 is the lepton doublet .",
    "the presence of some additional symmetries is assumed which prevents the majorana mass term of @xmath17 .",
    "this lagrangian gives rise to the following @xmath18 mass matrix in the @xmath19 basis @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dirac neutrino mass generated by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of the sm higgs doublet .",
    "block diagonalisation of the above mass matrix results in the effective light neutrino mass matrix as , @xmath22 unlike canonical seesaw where the light neutrino mass is inversely proportional to the lepton number violating majorana mass term of singlet neutrinos , here the light neutrino mass is directly proportional to the singlet mass term @xmath23 .",
    "the heavy neutrino masses are proportional to @xmath24 . here , even if @xmath25 tev , correct neutrino masses can be generated for @xmath26 gev , say if @xmath27 kev .",
    "such small @xmath23 term is natural as @xmath28 helps in recovering the global lepton number symmetry @xmath29 of the model .",
    "thus , inverse seesaw is a natural tev scale seesaw model where the heavy neutrinos can remain as light as a tev and dirac mass can be as large as the charged lepton masses and can still be consistent with sub - ev light neutrino masses .    in general , the inverse seesaw formula for light neutrino mass can generate a very general structure of neutrino mass matrix . since the leptonic mixing is found to have some specific structure with large mixing angles , one can look for possible flavour symmetry origin of it . in this context",
    ", non abelian discrete flavour symmetries have gained lots of attention in the last few decades . for reviews and related references ,",
    "please see @xcite . for the purpose of the present work",
    ", we are particularly interested in the inverse seesaw model proposed by @xcite where the non abelian discrete flavour symmetry is @xmath30 , the group of permutation of four objects , isomorphic to the symmetry group of a cube .",
    "the @xmath30 group has five irreducible representations , among which there are two singlets , one doublet and two triplets , the details of which are given in appendix [ appen1 ] .",
    "the field content of the @xmath30 based inverse seesaw model is shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the additional discrete symmetry @xmath31 as well as the global @xmath29 symmetry is chosen in order to generate the desired inverse seesaw mass matrix along with tbm type leptonic mixing .",
    "the lepton doublet and charged lepton singlet of the sm , the singlet neutrinos @xmath32 of the inverse seesaw model transform as triplet @xmath33 of @xmath0 .",
    "the sm higgs doublet @xmath15 transform as singlet under @xmath0 .",
    "the different flavon fields @xmath34 s are chosen in order to get the desired mass matrices and mixing .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian for the particle content shown in table [ tab2 ] reads @xmath35    .fields and their transformation properties under @xmath36 gauge symmetry as well as the @xmath37 symmetry [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     adding this correction to the leading order charged lepton mass matrix given in equation should give rise to a different diagonalising matrix @xmath38 of charged leptons .",
    "the structure of this matrix will depend upon the parameters @xmath39 which can be constrained from the requirement of producing the correct leptonic mixing matrix after multiplying with @xmath40 , the diagonalising matrix of light neutrino mass matrix . from the tree level model",
    "one can find @xmath41 .",
    "now , the total charged lepton mass matrix is @xmath42 where @xmath43 are unitary matrices that can diagonalise the complex charged lepton mass matrix . here",
    "@xmath44 is the known diagonal charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath45 goes into the observed leptonic mixing matrix and hence can be calculated as @xmath46 which can be written in terms of known @xmath40 from the leading order model and the known pmns mixing matrix .",
    "we parameterize the another unitary matrix @xmath47 in terms of three mixing angles and one phase and vary them randomly in @xmath48 for angles and @xmath49 for phase .",
    "thus , we can calculate the charged lepton mass matrix in terms of known parameters as well as randomly generated values of @xmath47 . for each possible such charged lepton mass matrix",
    ", we can then solve the above equation and calculate the model parameters such that correct leptonic mixing can be achieved . in this model",
    ", the dark matter candidate can either be a scalar doublet @xmath50 or a scalar singlet @xmath51 .",
    "we discuss their dark matter phenomenology below specially with reference to their interactions with the charged leptons .",
    "in the very early epochs of the universe , the abundance of a typical wimp dm relic particle @xmath52 is usually taken to be the equilibrium abundance . when the temperature of the radiation dominated universe cools down below @xmath53 , @xmath50 becomes non - relativistic and quickly after that it also decouples from the thermal bath and its abundance freezes out .",
    "the final relic abundance of such a particle @xmath50 which was in thermal equilibrium at earlier epochs can be calculated by solving the boltzmann equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number density of the dm particle @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the equilibrium number density . also , @xmath58 is the hubble expansion rate of the universe and @xmath59 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section of the dm particle @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear from this equation that when @xmath56 was in thermal equilibrium , the right hand side of it vanishes and the number density of dm decreases with time only due to the expansion of the universe , as expected .",
    "the approximate analytical solution of the above boltzmann equation gives @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the freeze - out temperature , @xmath63 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of freeze - out and @xmath64 gev is the planck mass . here",
    ", @xmath65 can be calculated from the iterative relation @xmath66 typically , dm particles with electroweak scale mass and couplings freeze out at temperatures in the range @xmath67 .",
    "the expression for relic density also has a more simplified form given as @xcite @xmath68 in the model discussed in the previous section , there can be two different types of dm candidates , the lightest neutral particle under the @xmath3 symmetry . in the model with corrections to neutrino sector , either the neutral fermion @xmath69 or the neutral component of the scalar doublet @xmath50 can be dm depending on their masses whereas in the latter model with corrections to the charged lepton sector , only the scalar dm is possible . to keep the discussion same for both these models , we briefly discuss scalar dm phenomenology in this work .",
    "the scalar dm relic abundance calculation has already been done in several works @xcite .",
    "typically , correct relic abundance can be satisfied for two regions of dm mass in such a model : one below the @xmath70 boson mass threshold and another around @xmath71 gev or more .",
    "here we focus mainly on the low mass regime where the dominant annihilation channel of dm is the one through higgs portal interactions . also , depending on the mass difference between different components of the scalar doublet @xmath50 , coannihilations can also play a non - trivial role . in the limit where higgs portal and coannihilation effects are sub - dominant",
    ", the dm can annihilate through the lepton portal interactions which are also relevant for correct neutrino phenomenology discussed above .",
    "we leave a detailed study of such lepton portal limit of scalar doublet dm to an upcoming work @xcite . here",
    "we briefly comment on the lepton portal interaction and its role in generating dm relic abundance using the approximate analytical formula mentioned above .",
    "it is straightforward to see from the lagrangian that the scalar dm can annihilate into leptons through a process mediated by heavy fermions @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding annihilation cross - section is given by @xcite @xmath74 with @xmath75 is the typical relative velocity of the two dm particles at the freeze out temperature , @xmath56 is the relic particle ( dm ) , @xmath15 is the yukawa coupling , @xmath76 the relic mass , @xmath77 is the mass of the gauge singlet mediating the annihilation .",
    "we then vary the dm mass and the yukawa coupling for different benchmark values of mediator masses and constrain the parameter space from the requirement of generating the correct dm relic abundance .",
    "it should be noted that , there are also constraints from dm direct detection experiments like lux @xcite which currently rules out dm - nucleon spin independent cross section above around @xmath78 for dm mass of around 50 gev .",
    "however , the lepton portal interactions can not mediate dm - nucleon interactions and hence such bounds are weak in these cases .",
    "in fact , such null results at direct detection experiments will push lepton portal interactions of dm into a more favourable regime .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay ( ndbd ) is a lepton number violating process where a heavier nucleus decays into a lighter one and two electrons @xmath79 without any antineutrinos in the final state .",
    "if the light neutrinos of sm are majorana fermions , then they can contribute to ndbd through the interactions shown in the feynman diagram of figure [ ndbd ] .",
    "the amplitude of this light neutrino contribution is @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the average momentum exchange for the process . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath82 are the masses of light neutrinos for @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the pmns leptonic mixing matrix mentioned earlier .",
    "the corresponding half - life of neutrinoless double beta decay can be written as @xmath85 where @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the mass of electron . also , @xmath88 is the nuclear matrix element .",
    "the recent bound from the kamland - zen experiment constrains @xmath89 half - life @xcite @xmath90 which is equivalent to @xmath91 ev at @xmath92 c.l .",
    "where @xmath93 is the effective neutrino mass given by @xmath94 here @xmath95 are the elements of the first row of the pmns mixing matrix .",
    "more explicitly , it is given by @xmath96 thus , the ndbd half - life is sensitive to the majorana phases and the lightest neutrino mass as well , which remain undetermined at neutrino oscillation experiments . in the present model ,",
    "the light neutrino contribution is the only dominant contribution .",
    "we check the predictions of our model for ndbd effective mass for both the cases and compare with the experimental bounds .",
    "we first parametrize the light neutrino mass matrix in terms of the @xmath97 global fit data available @xcite . for the correction to the neutrino sector case , we then use to relate the light neutrino mass matrix predicted by the model with the one parametrized by the global fit data . the leading order neutrino mass matrix given by contains two complex parameters @xmath98 whereas the correction to light neutrino mass is made up of four complex parameters @xmath99 as seen from .",
    "the parametric form of light neutrino mass matrix is complex symmetric and hence contains six complex elements .",
    "therefore , one can exactly solve the system of equations arising from in order to evaluate the model parameters in terms of the known neutrino parameters . to be more precise ,",
    "there are in fact five complex equations and one constraints arising from .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the total neutrino mass matrix predicted by the model , we have the 22 and 33 entries equal .",
    "this in fact restricts the light neutrino parameters , as it gives rise to two real equations involving the light neutrino parameters .",
    "we first solve these system of equations and generate the light neutrino parameters which satisfy them .",
    "for the resulting light neutrino parameters , we solve the other five complex equations to evaluate the model parameters .",
    "since we have six model parameters and only five equations now , we vary the parameter @xmath100 in the correction term randomly in a range @xmath101 ev . since there are nine neutrino parameters namely , three masses , three angles and three phases , one can in general , show the variation of model parameters in terms of all of these nine parameters which are being varied randomly in their allowed ranges . here",
    "we show only a few of them for illustrative purposes .",
    "for example , we show the variation of some of the model parameters in terms of the light neutrino parameters in figure [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "this shows that the model parameters in the leading order and the correction mass matrices can not be arbitrary , but have to be within some specific ranges in order to be consistent with correct light neutrino data .",
    "+          +          +          +          +        in the model with corrections to the leading order charged lepton mass matrix , we first find out the diagonalising matrix of light neutrino mass matrix as @xmath41 using the leading order results mentioned before .",
    "since the light neutrino mass matrix remains the same after the charged lepton correction , @xmath40 also remains same .",
    "however the addition of correction will change the left diagonalising matrix of charged lepton mass matrix from the magic matrix @xmath102 to something else , denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "now , using , one can relate the complete charged lepton mass matrix predicted by the model , with the parametrized one given by the right hand side of .",
    "the total charged lepton mass matrix can be written as @xmath103 which contains ten complex parameters . here",
    "@xmath104 correspond to @xmath105 respectively in the leading order charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "also there are two constraints in the parametrized charged lepton mass matrix due to fact that the @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 elements are equal .",
    "this severely constraints the mixing angles and phases .",
    "since the angles contained in @xmath45 are related to the pmns mixing angles , they can not be tuned arbitrarily .",
    "this forces some of the angles in @xmath47 to take very small values in order to satisfy these two constraints .",
    "the tiny values are required in order to compensate for the large hierarchy in charged lepton masses which enters the @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 elements of the mass matrix .",
    "we first solve these constraints numerically and then find the model parameters for those allowed values of mixing angles .",
    "we vary @xmath109 randomly in @xmath110 gev and evaluate other model parameters @xmath111 from the requirement of producing the correct leptonic mixing data .",
    "unlike the earlier model with corrections to the neutrino mass matrix , here we get very few number of allowed points . for illustrative purposes",
    "we show the variation of @xmath39 with some light neutrino parameters in figure [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] .",
    "+          +                     for the same set of allowed parameters , numerically evaluated for both the models , we also calculate the respective predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay and plot it as a function of the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the predictions for effective neutrino mass for both the hierarchies in the model where @xmath112 is generated from neutrino sector itself .",
    "as expected , the inverted hierarchy predictions lie very close to the upper bound on @xmath113 from kamland - zen experiment @xcite .",
    "similarly , fig [ fig13 ] shows the predictions for effective neutrino mass @xmath113 for the second model where the charged lepton mass matrix is given a correction to generate non - zero @xmath1 . due to",
    "very few number of allowed points in this case , the predicted values of @xmath113 are seen as a dot for both the hierarchies .",
    "this is also due to the fact the neutrino mass sum rule is valid in this case which restricts the lightest neutrino mass to a small range of values .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig13 ] , the latest kamland - zen data already disfavour this case for inverted hierarchy .",
    "if we zoom the points near the two dots in figure [ fig13 ] , they look like the points shown in figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "finally we show the allowed range of dark matter mass and its couplings to leptons from the requirement of satisfying correct dark matter relic abundance criteria in figure [ fig15 ] .",
    "as expected , higher the values of mediator mass , the larger yukawa couplings are needed to give rise to the correct relic abundance .",
    "such large yukawa couplings and smaller mediator masses favourable from lepton portal limit of dm will make the charged lepton correction case more favourable .",
    "this is because , one needs suppressed yukawa couplings or large mediator mass in order to generate sub - ev corrections to light neutrino mass , than generating sub - gev corrections to the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "we have studied a tev scale inverse seesaw model based on @xmath0 flavour symmetry which can naturally generate correct light neutrino masses with tri - bimaximal type mixing at leading order .",
    "the model also predicts a neutrino mass sum rule that can further predict the value of the lightest neutrino mass , that can be tested at experiments like neutrinoless double beta decay . since tbm mixing has already been ruled out by the latest neutrino oscillation data , we consider two possible ways of generating non - zero @xmath1 which automatically take dark matter into account . the idea is based on the scotogenic mechanism of neutrino mass generation , where neutrino mass arises at one loop level with dm particles going inside the loop .",
    "we first give such a one loop correction to the leading order light neutrino mass matrix and numerically evaluate the model parameters from the requirement of satisfying the correct neutrino data .",
    "this however , disturbs the mass sum rule prediction of the original model .",
    "the dark matter candidate in such a case could either be a singlet neutral fermion or the neutral component of a scalar doublet , depending whichever is lighter .",
    "we also study the possibility of generating @xmath114 by giving a correction to the charged lepton sector .",
    "such a case is found to be more constrained from the requirement of satisfying the correct neutrino data .",
    "we find much narrower ranges of points in terms of light neutrino parameters which can bring the model predictions closer to the observed data .",
    "consistency with light neutrino data also requires the right diagonalising matrix of charged lepton to have very small mixing angles .",
    "the dm candidate in this case is the neutral component of a scalar doublet .",
    "we also study the predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay and found that the charged lepton correction case with inverted hierarchy is disfavoured by the latest kamland - zen data .",
    "the predictions for effective neutrino mass in this model is very specific and confined to a tiny region around a particular value of lightest neutrino mass .",
    "this is due to the neutrino mass sum rule which forces the lightest neutrino mass to remain within a very narrow range .",
    "we also find the allowed parameter space for scalar dark matter from the requirement of producing the correct neutrino data , ignoring the higgs portal and gauge mediated annihilations . such lepton portal annihilations are efficient for large yukawa couplings or smaller mediator masses . since the same yukawa couplings and mediator mass go into the one loop correction for both neutrino and charged lepton mass matrix , the charged lepton correction is more favourable from lepton portal scalar dm point of view . as mentioned before ,",
    "this is due to the fact that large yukawa or small mediator mass will be able to generate sub - gev corrections to charged lepton mass matrix more naturally than generating sub - ev corrections to light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "also , the charged lepton correction case is much more predictive , as obvious from a much narrower region of allowed parameter space compared to the model with neutrino mass correction .",

    "<S> we study an inverse seesaw model of neutrino mass within the framework of @xmath0 flavour symmetry from the requirement of generating non - zero reactor mixing angle @xmath1 along with correct dark matter relic abundance . </S>",
    "<S> the leading order @xmath0 model gives rise to tri - bimaximal type leptonic mixing resulting in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> non - zero @xmath1 is generated at one loop level by extending the model with additional scalar and fermion fields which take part in the loop correction . </S>",
    "<S> the particles going inside the loop are odd under an in - built @xmath3 symmetry such that the lightest @xmath3 odd particle can be a dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> correct neutrino and dark matter phenomenology can be achieved for such one loop corrections either to the light neutrino mass matrix or to the charged lepton mass matrix although the latter case is found to be more predictive . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay is also discussed and inverted hierarchy in the charged lepton correction case is found to be disfavoured by the latest kamland - zen data . </S>"
