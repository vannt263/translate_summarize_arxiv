    "recently there has been of great interest in developing finite element method for interface problems where the discontinuous coefficients appear naturally due to the background consisting of rather different materials ; see , e.g.,@xcite .",
    "it is well known that classical finite element method work for interface problems provided that the mesh is aligned with the interface @xcite .",
    "such requirement may be a heavy burden especially when the interface involves complex geometry and therefore it is difficult and time - consuming to generate a body - fitted mesh . to release the restriction , li proposed an immersed finite element ( ife ) method for the two - point boundary value problem @xcite .",
    "this idea was further generalized into two - dimensional cases by li , lin , and wu who constructed a nonconforming ife method for interface problems @xcite .",
    "the main idea of ife is to solve interface problems on the cartesian mesh ( or uniform mesh ) by modifying basis functions near the interface .",
    "the optimal approximation capability of ife space was justified in @xcite . however , there is no proof for the optimal convergence of the classical ife method in the two - dimensional setting , see @xcite , even though plentiful numerical experiments showed optimal convergence for elliptic equations .",
    "interested readers are referred to @xcite for the progress of theoretical results . moreover",
    ", numerical test results demonstrated that classic ife method @xcite achieves only the first order convergence in the @xmath1-norm .",
    "there is relatively larger point - wise error over interfaces due to the discontinuities of test functions . to eliminate this disadvantage",
    ", the authors of @xcite added a correction term into the bilinear form of the classic ife method and @xcite proposed a new ife formulation in the framework of the petrov - galerkin method .",
    "however , the theoretical foundation of their methods is not fully established .",
    "alternatively , lin , lin , and zhang @xcite proposed ppife method to penalize the inter - element discontinuity .",
    "thanks to the added penalty term , the authors proved the coercivity of the bilinear form and showed the optimal convergence in the energy norm .",
    "superconvergence is an active research topic in the finite element community and its theory for smooth problems is well established , see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein . on the other hand , however , the superconvergence phenomena for interface problems is not yet well understood due to discontinuing of the coefficient crossing the interface . in @xcite , a supercloseness result between the linear finite element solution and its linear interpolation is proved for a two dimensional interface problem with body - fitted mesh .",
    "recently , the first two authors proposed an immersed polynomial preserving recovery ( ippr ) for interface problem and proved the superconvergence on both mildly unstructured mesh and adaptively refined mesh @xcite . for ife method , chou et al",
    ". introduced two special interpolation formula to recover flux more accurately for the one - dimensional linear and quadratic ife elements @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "cao et al . investigated nodal superconvergence phenomena using generalized orthogonal polynomial in the one - dimensional setting .",
    "for the two - dimensional case , the first two authors proposed a new gradient recovery technique @xcite for symmetric and consistent ife method @xcite and petrov - galerlin ife method @xcite and numerically verified its superconvergence .",
    "in addition , @xcite numerically showed supercloseness results for both symmetric and consistent ife method and petrov - galerlin ife method .",
    "the main goal of this work is to establish a complete superconvergence theory for the ppife method @xcite .",
    "our analysis relies on the following three key observations : 1 ) the solution is piecewise smooth on each sub - domain despite of its low global regularity ; 2 ) the basis functions on non - interface elements are just basis functions for standard linear finite element method ; 3 ) the number of interface elements is roughly @xmath2 .",
    "the above three observations motivate us to divide elements into disjoint types : interior elements , exterior elements , and interface elements .",
    "we can obtain the supercloseness using well - known results in @xcite on interior and exterior elements , respectively .",
    "in addition , the trace inequalities for the ife functions in @xcite and the third observation enable us to establish @xmath3 supercloseness result for interface elements .",
    "our supercloseness result reduces to the standard one as in @xcite when the discontinuity disappears .",
    "it is consistent with the fact that ife method becomes the standard linear finite element method when the discontinuity disappears .",
    "furthermore , we show that the gradient recovery method in @xcite can also be applied to the ppife method .",
    "the recovered gradient is proven to be superconvergent to the exact gradient of the interface problem , and therefore , provides an asymptotically exact _ a posterior _ error estimator for ppife method .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model interface problem and the ppife method . in section 3 ,",
    "we first establish the supercloseness between gradients of the ppife solution and the exact solution to the interface problem , and then based the supercloseness , we prove the recovered gradient using the method in @xcite is superconvergent to the exact gradient . then provides an asymptotically exact _ a posteriori _ error estimator for ppife method . in section 4",
    ", we present some numerical experiments to support our theoretical result .",
    "finally , we make some conclusive remarks in section 5 .",
