    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( @xcite ) provide important constraints on @xmath11-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath11cdm ) theories of galaxy formation , which predict that several hundred small dark halo satellites should surround the halos of large galaxies like the milky way ( mw ) and m31 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and that dsphs are the best candidates for the `` building blocks '' from which the mw and m31 were assembled @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a sizeable discrepancy between @xmath11cdm theory and observations , known as the `` missing satellite problem '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) , since the number of satellites predicted by theory is much higher than the number of dsphs actually observed to surround the mw .",
    "solving the `` missing satellite problem '' would require the discovery of many new dsph satellites of our galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dsph galaxies surrounding the mw can be divided into two groups : `` bright '' dsphs , mainly discovered before 2005 , and `` faint '' dsphs , discovered in the last couple of years primarily from analysis of imaging obtained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "bright and faint dsphs lie in two separate regions in the absolute magnitude versus half - light radius plane ( see figure  8 of belokurov et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter b07 ) .",
    "the bright dsphs include 10 systems ( draco , ursa minor , fornax , carina , sculptor , leoi , leoii , sextans , sagittarius , and canis major ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies generally are found to contain stars exhibiting different chemical compositions than the stars in the galactic halo ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , they generally host rr lyrae stars with pulsation properties that differ from the properties of the variables in the galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) , being `` oosterhoff - intermediate '' ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these two properties suggest that it is unlikely that the halo of the mw was formed from objects with properties similar to the bright dsphs that are observed today .",
    "since 2005 , 15 new faint ( effective surface brightnesses @xmath12@xmath13 28 arcsec@xmath14 ) dsph satellites of the mw have been discovered , primarily from sdss imaging : willmani , ursa majori , ursa majorii , bootesi , coma berenices ( coma ) , seguei , canes venaticii ( cvni ) , canes venaticiii ( cvnii ) , leoiv , hercules , leot , bootesii , leov , bootesiii and segueii ( @xcite ) .",
    "these faint galaxies have high mass - to - light ratios and ( often ) distorted morphologies , probably due to tidal interactions with the mw .",
    "they all host an ancient stellar population with chemical properties similar to that of external galactic halo stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "several of the faint dsphs have mean metallicities as low or lower than the most metal - poor gcs and , generally , much lower than those of the bright dsphs .",
    "galactic gcs that contain significant numbers of rr lyrae stars have fundamental - mode ( rrab ) pulsators with mean period ( @xmath4 ) either around 0.55 days or around 0.65 days , and separate into the so - called oosterhoffi ( ooi ) and oosterhoffii ( ooii ) types ( @xcite ) .",
    "extragalactic gcs and field rr lyrae stars in the bright dsph galaxies generally have , instead , @xmath4 intermediate between the two types ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "four of the faint dsphs have been searched for variable stars so far ( namely , bootesi , @xcite , @xcite ; cvni , @xcite ; cvnii , @xcite ; and coma , @xcite ) and , with the exception of cvni , were found to contain rr lyrae stars with properties resembling those of the mw oo ii gcs .",
    "all of the above characteristics suggest that a much larger population of objects similar to the presently observed faint dsphs may have been the  building blocks \" of the halos of large galaxies such as the mw .",
    "the association is particularly clear with the outer halo of the mw , which carollo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have demonstrated to exhibit a peak metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath15 , substantially lower than the inner halo ( with a peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ) , and which is the dominant population at galactocentric distances beyond 15 - 20 kpc .    the leoiv galaxy ( r.a .",

    "it is a low - mass [ m = ( 1.4 @xmath10 1.5 ) @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 ; @xcite ] system , with half - light radius @xmath30 @xmath31 3.3 arcmin ( b07 ) .",

    "we carry out a search for variable stars , and identify three fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars ( rrab ) and one sx phoenicis ( sx phe ) variable .",
    "we obtained @xmath43 , @xmath3 light curves for each variable star and use the average magnitude of the rr lyrae stars to estimate the distance to the galaxy .",
    "time - series @xmath43 , @xmath3 , @xmath44 photometry of the leoiv dsph galaxy was collected on 2007 , april 20 - 23 , with the wide field camera ( wfc ) , the prime focus mosaic ccd camera of the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) , on 2007 , may 11 - 12 , with the prime focus imaging platform ( pfpi ) of the 4.2 m william hershel telescope ( wht ) , and on 2007 , march - may , with the soar optical imager ( soi ) of the 4.1 m southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) .",
    "the fields of view ( fovs ) covered by the three instruments are : 5.24 @xmath27 5.24 arcmin@xmath45 for soi at the soar telescope , 16.2 @xmath27 16.2 arcmin@xmath45 for pfpi at the wht , and 33 @xmath27 33 arcmin@xmath45 for wfc at the int .",
    "we needed two partially overlapping soi fields to cover the galaxy , while just one pfpi field was sufficient , and from the int data we could also infer additional information on stars outside the leoiv half - light radius .",
    "we obtained a total number of 37 @xmath43 , 42 @xmath3 and 12 @xmath44 images of the galaxy . in this letter we present results from the analysis of the @xmath43 and @xmath3 data .",
    "images were reduced following standard procedures ( bias subtraction and flat@xmath1field correction ) with iraf .",
    "the int and wht data were corrected for linearity following recipies provided in the telescope s web pages .",
    "we then performed psf photometry using the daophot / allstar / allframe packages ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical internal errors of the @xmath2 single - frame photometry for stars at the hb level range from 0.02 to 0.03 mag for the int and wht data , and are of about 0.02 mag for the soar data .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration was obtained using observations of standard stars in the landolt ( 1992 ) fields sa101 , sa107 , sa110 and pg1323 , as extended by p.b .",
    "stetson , which were observed at the int during the night of 2007 , april 22 .",
    "errors of the absolute photometric calibration are @xmath46 mag , @xmath47 mag , respectively .",
    "variable stars were identified using the @xmath3 and @xmath43 time - series data separately .",
    "first we calculated the fourier transforms ( in the schwarzenberg - czerny 1996 formulation ) of the stars having at least 12 measurements in each photometric band , then we averaged these transforms to estimate the noise and calculated the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) .",
    "results from the @xmath3 and @xmath43 datasets were cross - correlated , and all stars with s / n@xmath48 5 in both photometric bands were visually inspected , for a total of about 2000 objects .",
    "we also checked whether some of the stars in the blue straggler stars ( bsss ) region might be pulsating variables of sx phe type .",
    "study of the light curves and period derivation were carried out using the graphical analyzer of time series package ( gratis ; @xcite ) .",
    "we confirmed the variability and obtained reliable periods and light curves for 3 rr lyrae stars , all fundamental - mode pulsators ( stars : v1 , v2 and v3 ) , and for one sx phe variable ( star v4 ) .",
    "the identification and properties of the confirmed variable stars are summarized in table 1 , their light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : curve_di_luce ] .",
    "the light curve data of the variable stars and the photometric data of the galaxy cmd are available on request from the first author . stars v1 , v2 and v4 lie inside the galaxy half - light radius , while v3 lies outside , at about 12 arcmin from the leoiv center ( see lower panel of figure  4 ) . in the cmd ,",
    "the sx phe star is located in the region of the bsss , while all the rrab stars ( v3 included ) fall near the galaxy s hb .",
    "we checked the position of v4 on the period@xmath1luminosity ( @xmath49 ) relation of the sx phe stars . using the star s period and the absolute magnitude inferred from the apparent magnitude and the distance provided by the rr lyrae stars ( see section  4 ) , we found that v4 lies very close to the @xcite @xmath49 relation for sx phe stars , thus confirming the classification as an sx phe star .",
    "so far , only 4 dsphs of oosterhoffii type are known , namely ursa minor among the bright companions of the mw , and bootesi ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , cvnii ( @xcite ) and coma @xcite , among the faint sdss dsphs .",
    "the average pulsation period of the leoiv rrab stars , @xmath4=0.655 days , would suggest that leoiv too is more similar to the oosterhoff type ii systems .",
    "however , in the @xmath3-band period - amplitude diagram ( see figure  [ fig : baileynew ] ) the leoiv rrab stars fall close to the locus of ooi systems ( from @xcite ) , with v1 and v3 lying near the distribution of the _ bona fide _ regular variables , and v2 lying close to the locus of the well evolved fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars in the galactic gc m3 ( from cacciari , corwin & carney 2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , v2 does not appear to be overluminous in the cmd , as would be required if the star were evolved off the zero - age hb .",
    "the ambiguous behavior and the small number of variable stars make the conclusive assignment of an oosterhoff type to the leoiv dsph rather difficult .",
    "we used the parameters of the fourier decomposition of the @xmath3-band light curve , along with the @xcite method for rrab stars , to estimate the metallicity on the zw84 scale of v1 , the only variable of our rr lyrae sample which satisfies the @xcite regularity conditions .",
    "the metallicity we derived for v1 is in good agreement with the spectroscopic metallicity derived for another rr lyrae star ( variable v2 ) by @xcite ( see last column of table  1 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows the @xmath3 , @xmath50 cmd of the leoiv dsph obtained by plotting all stellar - like objects located within the half - light radius of 3.3 arcmin from the b07 center of leoiv .",
    "the selection between stars and galaxies , for magnitudes brighter than @xmath3=22.5 mag , was done with the software source extractor ( sextractor ; @xcite ) .",
    "variable stars are plotted in the cmd according to their intensity - averaged magnitudes and colors ( see table  1 ) , using filled circles for stars v1 , v2 and v4 , and a cross for v3 .",
    "although well outside the leoiv half - light radius , v3 appears to be perfectly located on the galaxy s hb , thus confirming its membership to the galaxy .",
    "non - variable hb stars are marked by ( blue ) filled circles .",
    "the cmd reaches @xmath3 @xmath31 25.5 mag , and appears to be heavily contaminated at every magnitude level by field objects belonging to the mw .",
    "we used the mean ridgeline of the galactic gc m15 ( from @xcite ; solid line ) properly shifted in magnitude and color , and selected as stars most likely belonging to the leoiv galaxy the sources lying within @xmath100.05 mag from the ridgeline of m15 ( red dots ) . to allow for the larger photometric errors , for magnitudes fainter than @xmath3=23.5 mag",
    ", we also considered as belonging to the galaxy stars with @xmath51 color in the range from @xmath10 0.05 mag and @xmath10 0.10 mag from the ridgeline of m15 ( cyan dots ) .",
    "the hb of leoiv shows up quite clearly and , along with the galaxy s rgb , is well reproduced by the ridgeline of m15 , implying that leoiv has an old and metal - poor stellar population with metallicity comparable to that of m15 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath52 @xmath10 0.08 , on the zw84 scale ) .",
    "we also note that , by adopting for m15 a reddening value of @xmath53(@xmath50)= 0.10 @xmath10 0.01 mag @xcite , the color shift needed to match the hb and rgb of leoiv implies for the galaxy a reddening of @xmath53(@xmath50)= 0.04 @xmath10 0.01 mag . for comparison ,",
    "the reddening in the direction of leoiv obtained from the @xcite maps is 0.025 @xmath10 0.026 mag .",
    "the objects marked by open circles are stars within the leoiv half - light radius , whose membership to the galaxy was confirmed spectroscopically by simon & geha ( 2007 ) .",
    "they include the rr lyrae star v2 and a number of hb and rgb stars which fall very close to the m15 ridgeline , thus supporting our identification of the leoiv member stars .",
    "the upper panel of figure  4 shows a map of all sources observed in the fov of the wht observations that we consider to belong to the leoiv galaxy , according to their position with respect to the m15 ridgeline , or with membership spectroscopically confirmed by @xcite ( open circles ) .",
    "symbols and color@xmath1coding are the same as in figure  3 and , for non - variable stars , the symbol sizes are proportional to the star s brightness .",
    "the solid circle shows the region corresponding to the half - light radius of leoiv centered on the b07 coordinates for the galaxy .",
    "the lower panel of figure  4 shows a map of the sources observed in the int fov which lie within @xmath10 0.05 mag in @xmath51 ( for @xmath54 23.5 mag , within @xmath10 0.10 mag in @xmath51 ) from the ridgeline of m15 .",
    "an overdensity of objects rather extended and irregular in shape is visible , corresponding to the region occupied by the leoiv dsph .",
    "the black circle shows the half - light radius of leoiv , according to b07 .",
    "the peripheral location of v3 is remarkable , and provides further hints on the elongation and rather deformed morphology of the leoiv dsph .",
    "the average apparent magnitude of the galaxy s rr lyrae stars is @xmath55 mag ( standard deviation of the mean ) .",
    "assuming @xmath56 = 0.59 @xmath10 0.03 mag for the absolute luminosity of the rr lyrae stars at [ fe / h ] = @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58@xmath56/@xmath58@xmath59 $ ] = 0.214 @xmath10 0.047 mag dex@xmath60 for the slope of the luminosity - metallicity relation of rr lyrae stars ( @xcite ) , @xmath61 = 0.04 @xmath10 0.01 mag and [ fe / h ] = @xmath9 ( simon & geha , 2007 ) , the distance modulus of leoiv is @xmath62 = 20.94 @xmath10 0.07 mag which corresponds to a distance @xmath63 = 154 @xmath10 5 kpc .",
    "the error includes uncertainties in the photometry , reddening , metallicity , and rr lyrae absolute magnitude , but does not take into account evolution off the zero - age hb which might contribute an additional 0.05 mag uncertainty , bringing the total error budget to 0.09 mag .",
    "this new , precise distance estimate agrees very well with the distance of 160@xmath32 kpc derived by b07 .",
    "we have identified and obtained @xmath64 light curves for three fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars ( v1 , v2 and v3 ) and one sx phe variable ( v4 ) in the leoiv dsph galaxy . in the period@xmath1amplitude diagram v1 and",

    "one of the rr lyrae stars ( v3 ) lies at about 12 arcmin from the galaxy center . nevertheless , the mean magnitude places the star exactly on the galaxy hb and close to the other two rrab stars , thus suggesting a significant elongation of the leo iv galaxy .",
