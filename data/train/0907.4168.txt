    "recently , low  dimensional quantum anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnets in a field have been shown to display the analog of the supersolid phase @xcite . in the language of classical magnetism ,",
    "the phase is usually denoted as the biconical phase @xcite , in which the order parameters of both the antiferromagnetic and the spin ",
    "flop phase do not vanish .",
    "for instance , the supersolid phase has been found to occur in the ground state of a spin1 antiferromagnetic chain with exchange and single ",
    "ion anisotropies , applying monte carlo simulations and perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the uniaxial exchange anisotropy @xmath0 and the competing quadratic single ",
    "ion anisotropy @xmath1 had been fixed , @xmath2 @xcite . in our subsequent study on the same model , using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques , we provided evidence , for spin chains of finite length , for having two types of supersolid as well as two types of spin  liquid , known in classical magnetism as spin  flop , structures @xcite . in this contribution",
    ", we shall elaborate on our previous study . moreover",
    ", we shall also investigate another part of the ground state phase diagram by fixing @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and varying @xmath1 , as had been done before for a limited range of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "again , the supersolid phase is stable .",
    "in addition , we identify commensurate and incommensurate spin  liquid structures .",
    "we compare results on the quantum chains to ones on corresponding classical spin chains , discussing similarities and striking differences .",
    "in the following , we shall consider the spin1 anisotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain in a field described by the hamiltonian    @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the lattice sites .",
    "for @xmath6 , there is an uniaxial exchange anisotropy , along the direction of the field , @xmath7 , the @xmath8axis .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath1 , the single - ion term leads to a competing planar , @xmath9 , or to an enhancing uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "we shall analyse ground state properties using dmrg techniques @xcite for chains with open boundary conditions and up to @xmath10 sites .",
    "in addition , we shall determine the ground states of corresponding infinite chains with classical spin vectors of length one @xcite .",
    "we first briefly deal with the case @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the ground state phase diagram in the @xmath11 plane has been found @xcite to comprise antiferromagnetic ( af ) , spin  liquid ( sl ) , supersolid ( ss ) , ferromagnetic ( f ) , and ( 10 ) , with a magnetization plateau at half saturation , phases . at small values of @xmath0 and small fields , the haldane phase",
    "is observed @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the corresponding classical spin chain shows a much broader biconical ( bc ) phase , being effectively replaced not only by the supersolid phase but also , largely , by the spin  liquid and ( 10 ) phases .",
    "the classical ( 10 ) phase becomes stable only in the limit of an ising antiferromagnetic chain with a single  ion term , the blume  capel model .",
    "interesting information is given by the magnetization profiles , @xmath12 , with brackets , @xmath13 , denoting quantum mechanical expectation values .",
    "in particular , we observed distinct profiles in the ss phase in between the af and ( 10 ) and in between the af and sl phases , respectively",
    ". for odd @xmath14 , in the ss phase on approach to the ( 10 ) phase , the local magnetizations @xmath15 at odd sites stay close to one , while at even sites they tend roughly to zero .",
    "in contrast , in the ss phase on approach to the sl phase , the magnetizations on odd and even sites tend to take on the same values @xcite . in the sl phase we found also ( studying situations with @xmath0 exceeding @xmath16 2.5 ) two distinct types of profiles , for finite chains , when varying @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total magnetization @xcite : for @xmath19 , the profiles exhibit a broad plateau in the center of the chain , as expected for a classical spin  flop ( sf ) structure , while pronounced modulations in @xmath15 occur at @xmath20 , see fig .",
    "1 . this may signal a change from commensurate ( c ) to incommensurate ( ic ) structures @xcite .",
    "the suggestion is now confirmed and quantified by analysing the fourier transform of the profiles , especially at @xmath21 .",
    "the modulation in the ic region of the sl phase is described nicely by the wavenumber ( setting the lattice spacing equal to one ) @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "such an ic modulation , with algebraic decay , is expected to hold in the entire sl phase of the spin1/2 anisotropic heisenberg chain in a field @xcite . in the classical variant",
    ", we find no ic structures in the spin ",
    "flop phase , for finite and infinite chains .",
    "magnetization profiles in the spin  liquid phase for @xmath24 at various total magnetizations for a chain with @xmath25 sites . ]",
    "let us now turn to the case of fixed exchange anisotropy , @xmath26 , varying the single  ion term , @xmath1 .",
    "the ground state phase diagrams for the spin1 and the classical chains are depicted in figs . 2 and 3 , using dmrg calculations for chains with up to 63 sites for the quantum chain , and ground state considerations @xcite ( checked by monte carlo data ) for the infinite classical chain .",
    "we considered positive and negative single ",
    "ion anisotropies , @xmath1 .    for @xmath9 ,",
    "the supersolid or biconical phase is stable at zero temperature . as in the case of @xmath2 , the broad bc phase of the classical chain is effectively replaced , in the quantum chain , by the corresponding , rather narrow ss phase as well as sl and ( 10 ) phases .    ground state phase diagram of the spin1 anisotropic heisenberg chain with @xmath26 .",
    "+ ]    ground state phase diagram of the spin1 anisotropic heisenberg chain with @xmath26 .",
    "+ ]    in contrast to the case @xmath2 , the supersolid phase is always bordered by the af and sl phases .",
    "accordingly , we observe only one type of magnetization profile .",
    "illustrative examples are depicted in fig .",
    "4 , at @xmath27 and various fields . in the ss phase , at given single ",
    "ion anisotropy , @xmath1 , and field , @xmath28 , the magnetization takes on different values at odd and even sites in the center of the chain .",
    "the local magnetization @xmath15 tends to acquire the same value at odd and even sites on approach to the sl phase in the quantum chain .",
    "actually , the classical bc phase is usually described by two tilt angles , with respect to the @xmath8axis for the two sublattices formed by neighboring sites , with the tilt angles approaching each other when getting closer to the sf phase @xcite . obviously , this behavior is completely analogous to the one depicted in fig .",
    "magnetization profiles in the supersolid phase at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and fields @xmath29 varying between 6.5 and 6.8 .",
    "spin chains with @xmath25 sites are considered .",
    "the lower symbols denote the even sites , the upper ones the odd sites . ]    increasing @xmath1 , the large ",
    "d phase @xcite may eventually be stable .",
    "it corresponds to the planar phase in the classical model with vanishing field , with the spin vectors pointing perpendicular to the @xmath8axis , being the ground state for @xmath30 .",
    "the new phase may be expected to give rise to a sl phase at non  zero fields .",
    "a discussion of this interesting aspect is , however , beyond the scope of the present contribution .    for @xmath31 , the biconical or supersolid phase is no longer stable .",
    "in fact , only af , sl ( or sf ) , and f structures are encountered .",
    "the sl phase can be either commensurate , with a wide plateau in the magnetization profile away from the boundaries , or incommensurate , with modulations superimposed on the average magnetization .",
    "obviously , there are two ic phases , see fig .",
    "3 . the one , denoted by ic in fig .",
    "3 , occuring essentially in between the af and f phases , has been found before , having exponentially decaying transversal spin  spin correlations @xcite , in contrast to the usual spin ",
    "liquids with algebraic decay .",
    "it has no analog in the classical model , see fig .",
    "the related transition between the ic and sl@xmath32 phases has been obtained before , being either of first order or , at large average magnetization , continuous @xcite .",
    "our results agree with that description .",
    "we find another c  ic transition line between the sl@xmath32 and sl@xmath33 phases at somewhat larger fields for given @xmath34 , see fig .",
    "3 ( full circles ) . note that this transition seems to take place at @xmath17 significantly larger than 1/2 for @xmath35 .",
    "increasing @xmath1 , @xmath36 , in the vicinity of the ( 10 ) phase , the line goes over to the above discussed scenario with commensurate , @xmath37 , and incommensurate , @xmath38 , structures . by further increasing the planar single  ion anisotropy , @xmath34 being larger than roughly 3.6 , we observe in the sl@xmath32 phase close to the ( 10 ) phase modulated structures for rather short chains , @xmath39 .",
    "the possible , additional c  ic border is not displayed in fig .",
    "3 . indeed ,",
    "a more detailed analysis , taking into account finite  size effects , is desirable .",
    "in summary , we have studied ground state properties of spin1 antiferromagnetic anisotropic heisenberg chains with exchange and single  ion anisotropies in a field , for given ratio of the two kinds of anisotropies , @xmath2 , and for fixed exchange anisotropy , @xmath3 , with varying single  ion anisotropy . in both cases , supersolid phases",
    "are observed , in accordance with the behavior of the corresponding classical spin chain , displaying biconical phases .",
    "the extent of the supersolid phases is , however , substantially reduced as compared to that of the biconical phases .",
    "furthermore , the spin ",
    "liquid phases show distinct commensurate and incommensurate regions , presumably , separated by sharp transitions .",
    "the corresponding spin ",
    "flop phases in the classical model are always of commensurate type . in the quantum model",
    ", a ( 10 ) phase appears as a ground state , being present in the classical variant only in the ising limit , the blume  capel model .",
