    "a long standing challenge has been a problem of how to rectify unbiased random or periodic fluctuations into directional motion . for microscopic fluctuations , induced , e.g. , by brownian noise , this question has been debated since the inception of the random walk theory , and several important concepts have been worked out @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it has been established already by curie @xcite more than a hundred years ago that although a violation of the @xmath1 symmetry is not sufficient to cause a net directional transport of a particle subject to a spatially asymmetric but on large scale homogeneous potential , the additional breaking of time reversal @xmath2 symmetry , ( e.g. , due to dissipative processes ) , may lead to a macroscopic net velocity , such that here directed motion can result in the absence of any external net force .",
    "these systems , known currently as thermal ratchets @xcite , have been subject of intensive research , both theoretical ( see , e.g. refs . ) and experimental ( see , e.g. refs . ) .",
    "advancements in this field have been summarized in refs.@xcite .",
    "on the macroscopic scale , the same problem of obtaining a useful work from random or periodic perturbations has been known for many centuries and this task has been indeed accomplished in many instances ; to name but a few , we mention water- or windmills , or watches . in the latter case ,",
    "the watch makers had to create a mechanism capable to convert the raw power of the driving force into regular and uniform impulses , which was realized by inventing various so - called @xmath3 devices ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "such a devise is most often a sort of a shaft or an arm carrying two tongues - pallets , which alternately engage with the teeth of a crown - wheel .",
    "the pallets follow the oscillating motion of the controller - the balance - wheel or a pendulum , and in each cycle of the controller the crown - wheel turns freely only when both pallets are out of contact with it . upon contacts ,",
    "the pallets provide impulses to the crown - wheel , ( which is necessary to keep the controller from drifting to a halt ) , and moreover , perform a locking function stopping the train of wheels until the swing of the controller brings round the next period of release .    in this letter we exploite the concept of such an escapement device to build a molecular motor capable of doing a `` useful work '' under the action of random forces which average out to zero .",
    "the system we consider consists of a classical particle in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) two - wave potential , which is is composed of two periodic in space , identic time - independent components .",
    "one of them is externally driven by a random force and thus performs a random translational motion with respect to the other .",
    "this model has been previously proposed in ref.@xcite and it has been discovered that under certain conditions and for constant or periodic in time external driving force , the particle may perform totally directed motion with a constant velocity . here",
    "we demonstrate that in such a system the particle may move @xmath4 with a constant velocity even in situations when the @xmath5 of the driving force ( the controller ) fluctuates randomly in time .",
    "we show that the physical mechanism underlying such a phenomenon is indeed that of an escapement - type device - upon reaching certain levels , random fluctuations exercise a locking function creating the points of irreversibility in particle s trajectories such that , ( despite the fact that the fluctuations average to zero ) , the particle gets uncompensated displacements .",
    "repeated ( randomly ) in each cycle , this process ultimately results in a ballistic - type motion .",
    "focussing on the overdamped limit , we use this physical picture to map the original system onto a brownian motion ( bm ) process on a hierarchy of disconnected intervals .",
    "this allows us to work out simple analytical estimates for the particle s terminal velocity , which are in a very good agreement with monte carlo data .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we consider a simple piece - wise continuous potential @xmath6 \\displaystyle 1 - 2 \\frac{x- \\xi}{1 - \\xi } & \\mbox{if $ \\displaystyle x > \\xi$ } \\end{array}\\right .",
    "\\quad,\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath7 determines the asymmetry of the potential , with @xmath8 corresponding to the symmetric case .",
    "we will constrain our analysis here to the case @xmath9 .",
    "note that it has a periodicity @xmath10 , so that @xmath11 @xmath12 , an amplitude @xmath13 , and one minimum is located at @xmath14 , i.e.  @xmath15 .",
    "now , the total potential @xmath16 is the sum @xmath17 , where @xmath18 defines the external translation . because of the periodicity of the potentials @xmath19 , the potential @xmath16 is periodic in both arguments , so that @xmath20 @xmath21 . in this potential landscape , the equation of motion of a particle of mass @xmath22 in a 1d medium with damping",
    "@xmath23 reads : @xmath24 @xmath25 being the particle s trajectory .",
    "we note that energy is steadily pumped into the system through @xmath18 , and is dissipated when @xmath26 , which prevents particle s detachement .",
    "finally , we specify the properties of @xmath18 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath18 obeys the langevin equation , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a random gaussian , delta - correlated force with moments @xmath29 while the overbar denotes averaging over thermal histories .",
    "we will focus here mostly on the case @xmath30 , such that @xmath18 is just a trajectory of a symmetric 1d bm .",
    "the case when @xmath31 or when @xmath18 represents @xmath32 diffusion will be briefly discussed at the end of the paper .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the limit of an overdamped motion , @xmath33 \\gg 1 $ ] . as shown in ref.@xcite , in this limit dynamics of the particle",
    "is governed entirely by the evolution of different minima of the total potential @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , in order to obtain the trajectory @xmath25 and the average velocity @xmath34 , it suffices to study the time evolution of positions of these minima .",
    "this process has been amply discussed in ref.@xcite and here we will merely outline the main conclusions .    according to ref.@xcite , the particle s dynamics proceeds as follows : the total potential @xmath16 possesses a set of minima and position of each minima changes in time as the translation @xmath18 evolves . the particle , located at @xmath35 at the first minimum simply follows the motion of this minimum up to a certain moment of time , or more precisely , a time moment when this minimum reaches a certain point @xmath36 .",
    "these @xmath37-points are the points of instability @xmath38 in the @xmath39 plane , where the corresponding local minimum of the potential @xmath16 ceases to exist , and which emerge due to the asymmetry of @xmath19 .",
    "further on , when the minimum disappears , a particle located at such a point performs an irreversible motion jumping to one of two neighboring minima , which still exist .",
    "since the potential in the vicinity of each @xmath37 may have both a downward and an upward bending , the jumps may be performed in both the leftward and the rightward directions .",
    "depending whether @xmath9 or @xmath40 , the leftward or rightward jumps may result in uncompensated or compensated displacements .",
    "we now put the particle s dynamic rules deduced in ref.@xcite into a mathematical framework , amenable to analytical analysis , and introduce an auxiliary stochastic process @xmath41 .",
    "we will call @xmath41 as an `` effective translation '' , since it follows , apart of some special points ( to be specified below ) , the evolution of the potential minima visited by the particle and keeps track of both the translation @xmath18 and the effect of the irreversibility points which induce particle s leftward and rightward jumps to neighboring minima when the local minimum seizes to exist .",
    "we note also that the particle s actual trajectory @xmath42 almost everywhere , except for some special points ( to be specified below ) .",
    "the effective translation @xmath41 obeys the following smoluchowski - feynman ratchet form : @xmath43 where @xmath28 are random forces defined in eq.([force ] ) , while @xmath44 is a local operator , which may be thought of as a space - derivative of some `` effective '' potential .",
    "this operator equals zero everywhere except for the set of special points @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 . at these special points ,",
    "the action of the operator @xmath44 is as follows : when @xmath41 reaches @xmath46 , ( which we call the `` reflection point '' ) , the operator @xmath44 changes @xmath48 , ( i.e. shifts its value from @xmath46 to @xmath49 ) . on the other hand , when @xmath41 hits @xmath45 , the operator @xmath44 shifts the position of the reflection point from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , thus performing a `` locking '' function - @xmath41 can not now return below the point @xmath52 .    in fig.1",
    "we depict a typical realization of the process @xmath41 for @xmath30 .",
    "note that because of @xmath44 , @xmath41 experiences an effective drift in the negative direction ( for @xmath9 ) ; for @xmath53 one should , of course , regain a standard result @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "note now that @xmath41 can be viewed from a different perspective ; namely , @xmath41 can be regarded as a bm on a hierarchical lattice composed of a semi - infinite set of disconnected intervals of length @xmath56 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the process starts at @xmath35 at the origin of the first interval ( @xmath57 ) and evolves freely until it either hits the right - hand - side ( rhs ) boundary @xmath58 ( the reflection point ) , in which case it gets transferred instantaneously at position @xmath59 and continues its motion on the interval @xmath57 , or reaches the left - hand - side ( lhs ) boundary @xmath60 - the `` exit point '' and gets irreversibly transferred to the second ( @xmath61 ) interval . in the second , and etc , interval @xmath41 evolves according to the same rules .",
    "the particle s trajectory @xmath25 follows the process @xmath41 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath42 , except for two details : a ) when @xmath62 $ ] , @xmath47 , ( thick lines in fig.2 ) , @xmath25 sticks to the left boundary of these intervals , such that the trajectories @xmath25 are saltatory with the random pausing times corresponding to the times spent by @xmath41 in the intervals @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath47 , ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "b ) the event when @xmath41 hits the lhs boundary of the @xmath64-th interval and gets instantaneously transferred to the next interval ( i.e. @xmath41 does not have a discontinuity ) corresponds to the event when the particle makes a jump from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , i.e. at this point @xmath25 changes discontinuously . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that such jumps do not contribute to the average particle velocity @xmath67 and hence , @xmath68 .",
    "we turn next to the computation @xmath69 for @xmath30 .",
    "evidently , even in this simplest case the map depicted in fig.2 is too complex to be solved exactly .",
    "however , some simple analytical arguments can be proposed to obtain very accurate estimates of @xmath69 . to do this",
    ", we first note that it is only when passing from the @xmath64-th interval to the @xmath70-th one , ( which is displaced on a unit distance on the @xmath41-axis with respect to the previous one ) , the process @xmath41 gains an uncompensated ( negative ) displacement equal to the overlap distance of two consequitive intervals , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , we may estimate @xmath69 as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the mean time which @xmath41 `` spends '' within a given interval .    to estimate @xmath73 ,",
    "let us consider how @xmath41 evolves on a given interval ; @xmath73 is , as a matter of fact , the mean time needed for @xmath41 to reach diffusively for the first time the lhs boundary of the interval - the `` exit '' point @xmath74 , starting from the `` entry '' point @xmath75 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "we divide next the @xmath64-th interval into three sub - intervals : @xmath76 and @xmath77 , fig.3 .",
    "since @xmath78 , ( @xmath79 ) , for typical realizations of @xmath28 , the following scenario should hold : @xmath41 evolves randomly around the `` entry '' point and first hits the rhs boundary of the @xmath64-th interval passing thus through the sub - interval @xmath80 ; the mean time required for the first passage of @xmath80 is denoted as @xmath81 .",
    "for bm with diffusion coefficient @xmath82 , @xmath83 @xcite . further on , after hitting the rhs boundary , @xmath41 gets reflected to the point @xmath84 and evolves randomly around this point until it hits the lhs boundary of the interval - the `` exit '' point . for symmetric bm ,",
    "the time @xmath85 needed for the first passage through @xmath86 is equal to @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , @xmath87 and the velocity reads @xmath88 in fig.4 we compare our prediction in eq.([velocity ] ) and the results of monte carlo simulations , which shows that theoretical arguments presented here capture the essential physics underlying the dynamics of the random map depicted in fig.2 and , hence , of the process in eqs.([eq : motion ] ) and ( [ force ] ) .",
    "now , several comments on the result in eq.([velocity ] ) are in order .",
    "\\(i ) first , we note that @xmath69 , eq.([velocity ] ) , diverges when @xmath89 ( note , however , that @xmath90 for @xmath91 ) , which is a seemingly counter - intuitive behavior .",
    "such a behavior stems , as a matter of fact , from our definition of @xmath41 ; namely , by writing our eq.([l ] ) , we tacitly assume that both the effective step @xmath92 of the process @xmath41 and the characteristic jump time @xmath93 are infinitesimal variables , ( while the ratio @xmath94 is supposed to be fixed and finite ) . on the other hand , for any real system @xmath92 and @xmath93 might be very small but nonetheless are both finite . for finite @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath41 is a symmetric hopping process on a lattice with spacing @xmath92 and with the characteristic time @xmath93 .",
    "then , we have @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the number of elementary steps @xmath92 in the interval @xmath97 . this yields , in place of eq.([velocity ] ) , @xmath98 where now @xmath69 tends to a finite value when @xmath89 ( but still @xmath99 when @xmath91 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) second , notice that @xmath69 in eq.([velocity ] ) is a monotoneously increasing function of @xmath100 ; that is , the absolute value of @xmath69 is maximal when @xmath89 and minimal , @xmath101 , for the strongest asymmetry , @xmath102 .",
    "we note that such a behavior again stems from the definition of @xmath28 as a gaussian , _ delta - correlated _ noise .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath28 is influenced by some external processes , it might be characterized , e.g. , by correlations or be a non - local in space or in time ( discontinuous ) stochastic process . in both cases , the behavior of @xmath69 in the presence of such an external force would be different of that predicted by eqs.([velocity ] ) and ( [ velocityfin ] ) .",
    "consider now what will happen if @xmath103 represents the so - called delta - correlated lvy process ( lp ) with parameter @xmath104 ( see an exposition in excellent ref.@xcite for more details ) .",
    "we note here parenthetically that the case @xmath105 corresponds to the usual gaussian case , which yields conventional bm , while the case @xmath106 describes the so - called cauchy process .",
    "now , what basically changes when we assume that @xmath28 is the lp , is the form of the first passage times @xmath81 and @xmath107 . here , the time required for the first passage of an interval of length @xmath71 reads @xmath108 @xcite and hence , @xmath109 .",
    "consequently , we infer that @xmath69 will be a monotoneously increasing function of the parameter @xmath100 only for the lp with @xmath110 , i.e. for the persistent processes ( which have a finite probability for return to the origin ) . in the bordeline case of @xmath106 velocity",
    "will be independent of the asymmetry parameter .",
    "on contrary , for transient ( having zero probability of return to the origin ) processes with @xmath111 , which are not space - filling ( fractal ) and occupy the space in clustered or localized patches , one would find that @xmath69 is a @xmath112 function of @xmath100 .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , we consider the case when the bias is oriented in the positive direction , i.e. @xmath113 . in this case , @xmath41 is an asymmetric hopping process on a 1d discrete lattice of spacing @xmath92 and with transition probabilities @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) of jumps in the positive ( negative ) directions which obey @xmath116 , with @xmath117 , where @xmath118 denotes the reciprocal temperature .    here ,",
    "the symmetry @xmath119 , which exists for @xmath30 , is broken : when passing through @xmath80 the process @xmath41 follows the field , while the passage through @xmath86 takes place against it .",
    "supposing that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are both finite , we have that here : @xmath120,\\ ] ] where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to index @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , while @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "note that @xmath81 grows linearly with the sub - interval length @xmath71 , while @xmath85 shows much stronger , @xmath125 interval - length dependence , and hence , controls the overall time spent within a given interval .",
    "consequently , the particle s velocity in this case attains the form @xmath126},\\ ] ] which reduces in the diffusion limit to the following result @xmath127 the salient feature of these results is that here the particle s drift proceeds @xmath128 the applied field , due to fluctuations in the process @xmath41 - some ( exponentially small ) number of trajectories which travel against the field .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied dynamics of a classical particle in a 1d potential , composed of two periodic components , one of which is driven by an external random force .",
    "we have shown that in such a system the particle may move @xmath4 with a constant velocity even when the random driving force averages out to zero .",
    "we have demonstrated that the physical mechanism underlying such a behavior resembles the work of the so - called escapement device , used by watch makers to convert the raw power of the driving force into uniform impulses ; here , indeed , upon reaching certain levels , random forces lock the particle s motion creating the points of irreversibility , such that the particle gets uncompensated displacements . repeated ( randomly ) in each cycle , this process ultimately results in a ballistic - type motion . concentrating on the overdamped limit",
    ", we have used this picture to map the original system onto a bm process on a hierarchy of disconnected intervals , which allowed us to present analytical estimates for the particle s velocity .",
    "our analytical results are in a very good agreement with monte carlo data .",
    "extensions for systems with other than gaussian fluctuations and systems with global bias have also been presented .",
