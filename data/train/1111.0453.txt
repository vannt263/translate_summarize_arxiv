    "@xmath0fe was found in the earth crust , which arrived on earth @xmath1 myr ago ( knie et al .",
    "production of @xmath0fe in red giants can not explain the observed peak , so that its origin can only be a nearby ( 40 - 100 pc ) supernova ( sn ) .",
    "if one could estimate the mass ejected by the sn and the mass of the progenitor star , one could constrain sn models . to estimate the amount of @xmath0fe ejected , one needs to know the uptake factor ( fraction of material deposited in the crust among the whole material arrived on earth ) , the sn distance , the half - life of @xmath0fe , and the time since the sn ( i.e. the sum of the time mentioned above , @xmath1 myr , since the deposition in the crust , plus the travel time from the sn to the earth s crust through interstellar space and earth atmosphere ) . the uptake factor is probably few per cent , but hardly known with high precision",
    "; it is possible to constrain the factor , if other material would also be found in the earth s crust from the same sn event .",
    "the travel time from the sn to the earth crust is most likely negligible compared to the @xmath1 myr , since the sn must have been nearby , roughly 40 pc ( within a factor of 2 ) : if the sn would have been more distant than @xmath2 , the sn ejecta would not have been able to penetrate into the solar system given the solar wind ram pressure ; if the sn would have been closer than @xmath3 pc , a large cosmic ray flux on earth would have caused major climatic changes and a large mass extinction of life .",
    "hence , the distance towards the sn remains uncertain within the limits given , so that one can not derive the amount of @xmath0fe ejected from the amount found on earth .",
    "also , the mass of the sn progenitor star remains unknown .",
    "if we can identify the neutron star ( ns ) born in that sn and , by tracing back the motion of that ns , also the location of that sn event , we would know the distance towards the sn , i.e. could solve the degeneracy .",
    "we may even be able to determine the mass of the progenitor star from the difference between the age of the parent association ( if the ns was born in an association ) and ns kinematic age ( flight time ) , if all stars were formed at once in that association , as it is assumed by star formation theory and observed for most clusters .",
    "such results would be very important and valuable for sn theory , ejecta models , nucleosynthesis , etc .",
    "nss are born when massive stars ( @xmath4 to 30 m@xmath5 ) explode as sne after their short life - times of a few myr .",
    "hence , many of them should still be embedded in their star forming region , stellar association , or cluster , when they explode as sne . in such sne ,",
    "nss are formed , which receive a kick and fly away with large space motion .",
    "given the measured 2d proper motions of nss , one can construct the likely 3d ( and 1d radial velocity ) distributions ( arzoumanian et al .",
    "2002 , hobbs et al .",
    "nss also cool down fast after the sn , but are still hot enough for detection as faint optical or bright x - ray sources for up to 5 myrs ( see cooling curves in gusakov et al . 2005 , popov et al .",
    "young nss are detectable ( and have been detected ) as optical and/or x - ray sources within 1 kpc ( e.g. review in haberl 2007 ) .",
    "if the sn takes takes place in a binary system , then the companion star gets ejected and may then be observable as a run - away star ( blaauw 1961 ) ; the exact direction and velocity depends on the former binary orbit and the location of the ns and the companion during the sn . in principle , it is possible to trace back the motion of a ns to find out , whether it may have flown through a star forming region or young stellar association . if that is the case , and if the present mass function of that association is consistent with at least one very massive star , i.e. with at least one past sn , then the ns may have been born in that association . to get additional evidence for such a scenario , and also in case that a particular ns could have flown through more than one association , it would be best , if one could also identify a run - away star as former companion of the sn progenitor , also to have been at the same time at the same location as the ns and the association .",
    "then , the place of origin and the age of the ns would be known , as well as the distance towards the sn .",
    "it is indeed possible to trace back both nss and run - away stars to find close possible encounters in space and time , i.e. evidence for a sn event in a binary , e.g. hoogerwerf et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , tetzlaff et al .",
    "( 2011b ) . even without the identification of a former companion ,",
    "the parent association of a ns can be found ( tetzlaff et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 , 2011b ) .",
    "hence , it might be possible , but not guaranteed , to find the ns that was formed in the sn that also placed @xmath0fe onto earth .",
    "to identify potential parent sn sites of a ns , we calculate the trajectories backwards into the past for the ns , the centre of all nearby young associations , and all known young nearby run - away stars . the sample of known young nearby nss can be obtained from the atnf database ( manchester et al .",
    "a list of all known young nearby associations has been put together in tetzlaff et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011b ) . for a catalog of nearby run - away stars ,",
    "see tetzlaff et al .",
    "( 2011a ) . for details on the procedure , see tetzlaff et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011b ) . for run - away stars and associations , distances and 3d space motions are known .",
    "for nss , distances and 2d proper motions on sky are known , but the radial velocity is unknown for most nss .",
    "hence , we perform monte - carlo simulations by drawing the radial velocity from the most likely distribution .",
    "recently , eisenbeiss ( 2011 ) re - determined the parallaxe of the ns rxj0720 using archival hubble space telescope data yielding @xmath6 mas ( eisenbeiss 2011 ) , i.e. @xmath7 pc ( 192 - 500 pc ) ; this is consistent with an earlier determination by kaplan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , ( 270 - 530 pc ) within large error bars .",
    "we use the parallaxe and proper motion from eisenbeiss ( 2011 ) and vary the unknown radial velocity @xmath8 in a monte - carlo simulation using ( a ) the known distribution of ns velocities and , after we found that @xmath8 for rxj0720 is probably relatively small , ( b ) a flat distribution from @xmath9 to @xmath10 km / s ) .",
    "there are nine possible parent associations , through which rxj0720 could have flown , i.e. in which it could have been born ( twa , tuc - hor , @xmath11 pic - cap , hd 141569 group , ab dor group , col 140 , tr-10 , cara , argus ) . then , there are also three possible former run - away companion stars ( i.e. former companions of the sn progenitor star ) , which could have been at the same place at the same time as rxj0720 , for a certain ns radial velocity , namely hip 43158 , 57269 , and 76304 ( run - away stars from tetzlaff et al .",
    "if hip 57269 or 76304 would have been the former companion , the sn would have taken place at @xmath12 or @xmath13 pc , respectively , but the current measured distance of rxj0720 would be inconsistent with the predictions in such cases . for hip 43158 ,",
    "however , the current measured distance of rxj0720 is fully consistent with the prediction in case that it would have been the former companion of the rxj07020 sn progenitor : the sn would have been @xmath14 myr ago in tr-10 at the distance of @xmath15 pc ( during the sn ) , fig .",
    ", rxj0720 should now have a radial velocity of @xmath16 km / s .",
    "the difference between the kinematic age of the ns ( @xmath14 myr ) and the tr-10 association age ( 1535 myr , tetzlaff et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) then yield the life - time and mass of the progenitor star , namely @xmath17 to 15 m@xmath5 .",
    "hence , rxj0720 is not the ns born in the sn that placed the detected fe onto earth .",
