    "however , most crystals are not perfectly periodic ; in fact , the regular pattern of atoms may be disturbed by various defects which fall into two main classes : there are defects which leave the lattice unchanged ( like impurities or vacancies ) , and there are more serious `` geometric '' defects of the lattice itself , cf .",
