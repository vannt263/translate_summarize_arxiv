    "as stated by einstein in his paper from 1912 @xcite , submitted just before his departure from prague , the equivalence principle is _ _ `` eine natrliche extrapolation einer der allgemeinsten erfahrungsstze der physik '' _ _ , and can consequently be claimed to be exactly valid on all scales .",
    "since the equivalence principle is compatible with einstein s relativity principle of 1905 only in the limit of constant gravitational potential , accepting the principle of equivalence meant that a new foundation for the theory of gravitation must be sought .",
    "the challenge of doing so , which einstein in his 1912 paper poses to his colleagues : _",
    "`` ich mchte alle fachgenossen bitten , sich an diesem wichtigen problem zu versuchen ! '' _ , is one that he himself devoted the coming years to , finally arriving at the 1915 theory of general relativity .",
    "general relativity describes the universe as a 4-manifold @xmath0 with a metric @xmath1 of lorentzian signature .",
    "the einstein equations , @xmath2 originally given in @xcite , relate the geometry of spacetime @xmath3 to matter fields with energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 . by the correspondence principle ,",
    "the stress energy tensor @xmath4 should correspond to the stress energy tensor of a special relativistic matter model , and in particular be divergence free .",
    "for `` ordinary matter '' one expects @xmath4 to satisfy energy conditions such as the dominant energy conditon .",
    "here i have included the `` cosmological constant term '' @xmath5 in , which was not present in the equations given in @xcite .",
    "the left hand side of , where @xmath6 is the ricci tensor , @xmath7 is the ricci scalar and @xmath8 is a constant , is the most general covariant tensor expression of vanishing divergence , depending on @xmath1 and its derivatives up to second order , and linear in second derivatives .",
    "further , its left hand side is the most general second order euler - lagrange equation , derived by varying a covariant lagrange density defined in @xmath1 and its first two derivatives , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the covariance of the equations of general relativity under spacetime diffeomorphisms , makes the theory compatible with the strong version of the equivalence principle .",
    "since it can be claimed to be exactly valid , the equivalence principle is subject to empirical tests and there is a long history of experiments testing various versions of the ( weak or strong ) equivalence principles , see e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite in this volume . until the present , the equivalence principle has survived all experimental tests , and an experiment clearly demonstrating a deviation from the predictions based on the equivalence principle would necessitate a revision of the foundations of modern physics .",
    "the arguments of the physicist and philosopher ernst mach played an important role in the development of einstein s ideas leading up to general relativity , including the formulation of the equivalence principle .",
    "the fact that in general relativity , matter influences the motion of test particles via its effect on spacetime curvature means that in contrast to newtonian gravity , the `` action at a distance '' which was critizised by mach is not present in general relativity , which hence agrees with the guiding idea which einstein referred to as `` mach s principle '' , i.e. loosely speaking the idea that the distribution of matter in the universe determines local frames of inertia , see @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the role of mach s principle in the context of cosmology is discussed in @xcite .",
    "this played a central role in einstein s development of general relativity , and also in his discussion of general relativistic cosmology , but it appears difficult to formulate experimentally testable consequences , cf .",
    "@xcite , although mach s principle has of course been brought up in connection with `` newton s bucket '' and frame dragging .",
    "the book @xcite gives an excellent overview of issues related to mach s principle .",
    "however , the principles which are most relevant for the present discussion are the hierarchy of `` cosmological principles '' , for example the cosmological principle of einstein and the perfect cosmological principle of bondi , gold and hoyle .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of the cosmological principles .",
    "these principles play a role which is fundamentally different from that of the equivalence principle , in the sense that they do not make predictions which are expected to be exactly true at all scales . at best",
    ", they can be viewed as simplifying assumptions that enable one to construct testable physical models .",
    "o0.4   kepler s model of the solar system based on platonic solids , from mysterium cosmographicum ( 1596 ) .",
    "the work of kepler , who is perhaps more intimately connected with prague than einstein , provides an interesting illustration of the relationship between theoretical principle and observation . in the time of kepler , the world - model of copernicus",
    "had placed the sun at the center of the universe and described the planets as moving on circular orbits around it .",
    "not long before his move to prague in 1600 , kepler believed himself to have completed the copernican world - model based on the mathematical perfection of circles , by adding to it an element of equal perfection and beauty , namely the geometry of the platonic solids , which according to kepler s expectations would determine the sizes of the planetary orbits .",
    "fortunately , it was possible for kepler to use tycho brahe s observational data to test the predictions of his model .",
    "to his deep consternation kepler realized that the planets do not , after all , move on circular orbits .",
    "the beautiful principles which had inspired kepler to laboriously analyze the observational data of tycho had to be discarded . in analyzing the data ,",
    "kepler not only discovered his three laws of planetary motion but also came close to introducing the notion of force which became fully clear only through the work of newton .",
    "one could say that through the work of kepler and later newton , one set of `` a priori '' principles ( those of copernicus and kepler ) were replaced by a model based on the dynamical laws of newtonian gravity .",
    "although newtonian ideas continued to dominate physics throughout the 19th century , there were well known anomalies of a theoretical as well as observational nature , and these served as a guide for the developments of the early 20th century .",
    "the conflict between the covariance of maxwell theory under the lorentz group and the more restricted invariance properties of the newtonian laws led to the introduction of special relativity .",
    "similarly , as discussed above , the incompatibility of special relativity and gravitation led to the development of general relativity .",
    "the explanation of the anomalous precession of the perihelion of mercury @xcite by general relativity was , together with its new prediction for the deflection of light by the sun , confirmed by subsequent observations @xcite , were among the factors which led to its rapid acceptance .    among the main paradoxes of newtonian physics and world",
    "view in applications to cosmology were olbers paradox and the incompatibility of newtonian gravity with infinitely extended homogenous matter distributions , which had prevented the construction of a cosmological model consistent with newtonian ideas .",
    "this latter fact , which had been elucidated by von seeliger and others , see @xcite for discussion and references , played an important role in einstein s reasoning about cosmological models in his 1917 paper @xcite , in particular in motivating the introduction of the cosmological constant in that paper .",
    "as has already been mentioned , the philosophy of mach , albeit firmly based in newtonian physics , was an important source of inspiration for einstein .",
    "however , incorporating machian ideas in a general relativistic cosmology presented serious difficulties .",
    "after some early attempts had been discarded , einstein in @xcite adopted a spatially homogenous model of the universe as a means of making a general relativistic cosmology compatible with machian ideas . introducing a `` cosmological constant '' term @xmath9 in the field equation of general relativity , which einstein first motivated through a discussion of homogenous matter distributions in newtonian gravity , and assuming that there is a family of observers who see the same matter density everywhere , led to a static universe filled with a homogenous and isotropic matter distribution .",
    "the spacetime of the einstein model is a lorentzian cylinder .",
    "the line element takes , up to a rescaling , the form @xmath10 this give a solution to with positive @xmath8 , and with matter consisting of a pressureless fluid with everywhere constant energy density .    shortly after einstein s initial work on a static general relativistic cosmology , friedmann @xcite proposed a model of an expanding universe @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a scale factor , @xmath13 for @xmath14 is the sperical , flat or hyperbolic metric .",
    "line elements of the form are also called robertson - walker line elements , see below . during the 1920s ,",
    "lematre and hubble showed , based on observational work of slipher , humason and others , that redshift increases with distance leading to the hubble law , see figure [ fig : hub_1929 ] , which fits with the expanding friedmann models .",
    "o0.5     in the context of the expanding friedmann models , olbers paradox can be resolved .",
    "expanding friedmann models containing ordinary matter have @xmath15 at some time in the past , where spacetime curvature and matter densities diverge .",
    "these models led , via the work of lematre , gamow , hoyle and others , to the hot big bang model which is the basis for the cosmological models in use today .",
    "e. a. milne criticized the big bang models on the basis that they introduced an extraneous `` cosmic time '' and also that they lacked explanatory power ( e.g. the sign of the spatial curvature is a priori undetermined ) .",
    "instead , he proposed an extension of what he termed `` einstein s cosmological principle '' , to the effect that `` the universe must appear the same to all observers '' @xcite .",
    "milne added to this the postulate that observations are interpreted by each observer according to the principles of special relativity and argued that this `` extended relativity principle '' led to an essentially unique cosmological model .",
    "the derivation of the general form of the line element compatible with the isotropy of the universe , and also with einstein s cosmological principle in the sense discussed by milne was given by robertson @xcite and walker @xcite around the same time , and found to be of the same form as that used by friedmann and lematre in their cosmological models .",
    "as pointed out by robertson @xcite , the general relativistic line element compatible with milne s cosmology is a special case of , namely the empty @xmath16 universe , which is locally isometric to minkowski space .",
    "this is therefore known as the milne model .",
    "it was a similar dissatisfaction with the lack of predictivity of general relativistic cosmology that led bondi , gold and hoyle @xcite to introduce the `` perfect cosmological principle '' , which is essentially a version of the postulate of milne , but viewed from the perspective of general relativity . by allowing for creation of matter",
    ", they showed that it is possible to construct an expanding cosmological model satisfying this principle .",
    "however , the perfect cosmological principle tightly constrains the possible models of the universe and the resulting steady state model is considered to be incompatible with observations .",
    "the book of kragh @xcite contains an interesting discussion of the conflict between the steady state model and the now - standard `` big bang '' cosmology .    from the current perspective",
    ", it may be said that the introduction of what milne called einstein s cosmological principle led to a class of general relativistic cosmological models . by introducing a collection of perfect fluids ,",
    "a much simplified version of the problem of cosmological modelling reduces to the problem of fitting a relatively small number of parameters to observational data , which could be said to put cosmology on a similar footing as high energy particle physics . indeed , as mentioned by peebles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter i ) , it was weinberg @xcite who introduced the notion , borrowed from high energy particle physics , of a `` standard model '' into cosmology .    at present , with the tremendous influx of data from observations of many different types and at many different wavelengths , including observations of the cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys , it is often stated that we are entering an era of precision cosmology .",
    "however , the widening range of observational methods makes the process from observations to parameter estimation increasingly complex .",
    "in particular , the prominent role of simplifying assumptions or principles in the formulation of cosmological models and the model depence in the analysis of astronomical data , makes it important to keep in mind the difference between a model which fits data to a high degree of precision and a model which accurately describes the actual universe @xcite .",
    "for a friedmann model , with line element of the form , the stress energy tensor has the form @xmath17 which is compatible with perfect fluid matter . here",
    "@xmath18 is the unit timelike normal to the @xmath19 level sets , which in the special case of the friemann model coincides with the normalized 4-velocity of the fluid particles , @xmath20 is the energy density of the matter and @xmath21 is the pressure .",
    "we consider matter and radiation as described by a collection of fluids , indexed by @xmath22 , with linear equations of state , @xmath23 the hubble constant ( i.e. up to a constant factor the mean curvature of the @xmath19 level sets ) is @xmath24 in the special case of a friedmann model , the contribution of the curvature of the @xmath19 level sets in the einstein equations can be described in terms of a fluid with equation of state @xmath25 , while the effect of the cosmological constant can be described by a fluid satisfying @xmath26 .",
    "thus if we consider a simple model containing a fluid with pressure zero ( dust ) , and with a cosmological constant @xmath8 , this can be described by introducing the dimensionless density parameters @xmath27 the model can be parametrized by the present values @xmath28 of the density parameters .",
    "the conservation of matter and equation of state implies that the fluid densities @xmath29 depend only on the scale factor @xmath30 the hamiltonian constraint ( i.e. the projection of the einstein equations on @xmath18 ) takes the form @xmath31 which , using , can be written as @xmath32 here @xmath33 are the present value of the hubble constant and of the scale factor respectively .",
    "due to the uncertainty in the value of @xmath34 , it is usually given in terms of a dimensionless parameter @xmath35 as @xmath36 equation can be integrated to relate observable quantities , e.g. redshift and luminosity distance , for given values of the parameters @xmath37 .",
    "it is convenient to study the global behavior of friedmann models of the dimensionless density parameters .",
    "this analysis is explained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) , see also @xcite . due to the hamiltonian constraint , we have @xmath38 .",
    "the fixed points of the dynamial system in the @xmath39 plane are the einstein - de sitter big - bang model @xmath40 and the spatially flat de sitter model @xmath41 , as well as the empty @xmath42 milne model @xmath43 .",
    "one finds that @xmath44 is a source and @xmath45 is a sink , while @xmath46 is a saddle point .",
    "the static einstein universe has @xmath47 , so the dimensionless parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 are ill - defined , but this point may be represented in an extended phase space as @xmath50 .",

    "in fact , this growth rate is maximal among @xmath51 models .",
    "this indicates that rapid volume growth goes together with stability .    . the black , solid curve is the standard model , while the green , dashed curve is the einstein - de sitter model .",

    "there is an initial singularity , @xmath15 as @xmath58 and the universe expands indefinitely to the future , @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "the model predicts a hot big bang , which leads to the prediction of cosmic background radiation @xcite .",
    "the observation of a highly homogenous cosmic background radiation with a spectrum close to that of a black body is a major success of the big bang models of cosmology .",
    "most of the energy density in the standard model consists at present of as yet unknown `` dark matter '' ( accounting for approximately 85% of the matter density ) and `` dark energy '' in the form of the cosmological constant .",
    "dark matter , which for a long time has been broadly accepted in astronomy and cosmolocy , cf .",
    "@xcite , is distinguished from dark energy by the fact that its existence is motivated by studies of the dynamics of galaxy clusters and galactic rotation curves , which are independent of the friedmann model which forms the basis of the standard model in cosmology . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmological constant was deemed unacceptable on philosophical grounds and entered the standard model fairly recently , shortly before the year 2000 ; the effects of dark energy being seen only indirectly via cosmological models and eg . studies of structure formation in the universe .",
    "the acceptance of @xmath8 came about only after the observation of the dimming of type ia supernovae .",
    "the observations are interpreted as saying that the rate of expansion is accelerated , i.e. @xmath61 , which is incompatible with a friedmann model filled with ordinary matter and @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig : snia ] shows the supernova data compared to the standard model and einstein - de sitter .",
    "the horizontal axis is the milne model ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "one of the important arguments against introducing the cosmological constant ( apart from the difficulty of explaining the value @xmath8 which appears motivated by cosmology from the point of view of particle physics ) has been the _ coincidence problem _ , which might also be termed the `` why now '' problem .",
    "figure [ fig : whynow ] shows the time evolution of the dark energy density @xmath49 .",
    "we see that it is only close to the present epoch that @xmath49 becomes significant , and in the later universe it will dominate the dynamics . due to the different scaling behavior of the matter and @xmath8 densities in view of",
    ", the fact that these are both of order unity at the present epoch is a coincidence that could be argued to be contrary to the idea that we are not `` special observers '' .",
    "in contrast , in the einstein - de sitter model the matter density is time independent .",
    "a related problem is the _",
    "flatness problem_. roughly speaking , this is the question why @xmath63 at present . in case",
    "@xmath51 this can be seen to be problematic simply from figure [ fig : whynow ] . since @xmath44 is unstable , fine tuning of the initial conditions is required in order to have @xmath63 at present .",
    "lake @xcite argues , using the presence of a conserved quantity for the dynamics in the @xmath39-plane , that fine tuning is not needed to have @xmath63 throughout the history of the universe .",
    "the universe is not exactly homogenous or isotropic ; this holds at best in an approximate sense on sufficiently large scales .",
    "this raises the problem of whether it is possible to determine from observations , which are necessarily restricted to our past light cone , to what extent , and at what scales , the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy is valid .",
    "a problem here is that local isotropy ( i.e. isotropy around the world line of one observer ) does not imply global homogeneity .",
    "the ehlers - gehren - sachs theorem gives conditions under which it is possible to conclude from exact isotropy of the cosmic microwave background that the universe is exactly isotropic .",
    "however , this result can fail in several ways .",
    "for example , there are homogenous but non - isotropic models where the cmb is exactly isotropic at one instant in time",
    ". extensions of the egs theorem to situations where only approximate isotropy of the cmb holds are problematic , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this raises the problem of determining to what degree observations of the actual universe can be modelled and analyzed in the framework of friedmann models ( and perturbations thereof ) .",
    "one aspect of this problem is the question whether there is a scale at which ( statistical ) homogeneity and isotropy can be said to hold .",
    "current estimates place this scale at approximately 150@xmath64 mpc , see e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations indicate the existence of inhomogenous structures of a dimension which may be in conflict with isotropy at this scale , see @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that observations which extend to ever higher redshifts continue to yield evidence of structures in the universe of a size comparable to the homogeneity scale .",
    "some aspects of inhomogeneity in cosmology were recently surveyed in a focus issue of cqg , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the question of how the potential effects of large scale inhomogeneities on observations should be analyzed raises several important issues .",
    "ellis has formulated the `` fitting problem '' , see @xcite and references therein , which asks about the effect of analyzing observations from an inhomogenous universe via a friedmann model which is in some sense the `` best fit '' to the actual universe .",
    "the effect on observations of the fact that the model universe used to analyze data is only an approximation of the actual universe is sometimes referred to as `` backreaction '' .",
    "an important question here is whether perturbation theory can be applied to take into account the deviation of the model from the actual universe .",
    "kolb and collaborators have argued @xcite that this analysis should take into account the peculiar velocities due to the different expansion rate in the model and the actual universe .",
    "another effect of inhomogeneities which also sometimes is referred to as backreaction , is the _ dynamical _ effect of the inhomogeneities on the expansion of the universe .",
    "a possible approach is to use averaging @xcite or coarse - graining @xcite to derive a set of effective equations modelling the universe . in order to carry out such a scheme",
    ", one must introduce closure relations which allow one to extract an autonomous system .",
    "it is here worth mentioning the ideas on multi scale averaging , see e.g. @xcite . in particular , wiltshire @xcite argues that one should consider modifying the copernican principle to take into account the idea that we reside in a gravitationally bound structure in a universe which has both bound systems and voids .",
    "it is apparent that the matter distribution in the universe is `` lumpy '' due to the matter concentrations in stars , galaxies and other structures , and inhomogenous due to the presence of large scale voids and bound structures , and the effect of these must be taken into account when analyzing observations , see clarkson et al .",
    "@xcite for discussion .",
    "the optical properties of the universe are , in the friedmann models which form the basis for the standard model of cosmology , calculated using the properties of a fluid which is used to approximate the actual matter distribution .",
    "thus it is necessary to analyze whether the optical properties of a lumpy matter distribution differ in a significant way from the optical properties of a fluid .",
    "light from distant stars passes through the gravitational wells of bound objects as well as voids on the way to the observer , and the effect of this process must be analyzed and compared to light passing through the fluid in a friedmann model .",
    "this problem has been studied by among others clifton et al @xcite , see also @xcite . in this context",
    ", we also mention the so - called swiss cheese models , in which one attempts to analyze the optical effect of voids and structure in the universe by introducing under - densities in a background friedmann model , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the swiss cheese models generally suffer from the limitation that the over - all expansion of the model is determined by the chosen background friedmann geometry .",
    "in this situation one may contemplate introducing weaker cosmological principles , incorporating ideas of statistical homogeneity , or weakening the copernican principle by restricting to matter bound observers as suggested by wiltshire .",
    "as we have seen , the standard cosmological model is not located at a fixed point for the dynamical system governing the evolution of the dimensionless parameters @xmath65 , rather it is close to the spatially flat orbit connecting the source @xmath44 to the sink @xmath45 .",
    "further , in that orbit , @xmath66 takes on all positive real values .",
    "thus , we as observers are not in an asymptotic regime , but rather , as mentioned above , at a special moment where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are both of order unity .",
    "thus , from this point of view , we are neither in the `` early universe '' or the `` late universe '' and we can not argue that our current universe is singled out as the asymptotic state of the evolution of the universe .",
    "this makes the situation in cosmology rather different from the situation in many branches of physics where asymptotically stable objects are those which one expects to find in nature . as an example",
    ", the kerr black hole solution is expected to be the unique stationary , asymptotically flat black hole spacetime . in order to establish the astrophysical significance of this solution",
    ", it is essential to prove that it is stable .",
    "this leads to the black hole stability problem , one of the central open problems in general relativity .",
    "the problem of determining from observations whether or not for example the supermassive black holes expected to be found at the center of most galaxies are kerr black holes or not is being actively studied .",
    "as was just mentioned , from the point of view of the current standard model in cosmology , questions about the asymptotics of cosmological models do not appear to be the right ones to ask . nevertheless , such questions give rise to interesting mathematical problems which we shall discuss in the rest of this paper .",
    "the questions about the asymptotic behavior of cosmological models include the structure of the big - bang singularity and questions about the behavior in the expanding direction .",
    "in particular we can ask : what does an observer in the late universe see ?",
    "in this section we will describe a scenario for the asymptotic future behavior of cosmological models with vanishing cosmological constant . recall that the milne model with line element @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the hyperbolic 3-metric with sectional curvature @xmath69 , is isometric to the flat interior of the lightcone in minkowski space .",
    "the milne universe may be viewed as the future of @xmath70 , the origin in minkowski space .",
    "this point represents the big bang singularity in the milne universe and is in the past of all spacetime points ( i.e. all observers ) .",
    "the cosmological time at a point @xmath71 is the proper time elapsed from the origin to @xmath71 .",
    "the level surfaces of cosmological time are simply the hyperboloids .",
    "we next consider a flat , but non - isotropic model , which may be viewed as a deformation of milne .",
    "let @xmath72 be a spacelike interval in minkowski space and consider the future of @xmath72 .",
    "the resulting spacetime can be constructed by cutting the milne spacetime by a timelike hyperplane through @xmath70 and gluing in a spacetime of the form @xmath73 with line element @xmath74 the deformed milne spacetime has a big - bang singularity given by the interval @xmath72 , and defining the cosmological time at @xmath71 as the maximal proper time of any past inextendible geodesic starting at @xmath71 the level sets of cosmological time are as in figure [ fig : deformedmilne ] .",
    "the deformed milne universe is flat and empty , but not homogenous and isotropic . measuring the volume of co - moving regions in the deformed milne universe",
    "we see that in the deformed regions , the volume of the cosmic time levels grows asymptotically as @xmath75 , i.e. the growth rate of the einstein - de sitter universe , while in the undeformed regions , the growth rate is asymptotically as @xmath19 .",
    "the behavior is similar for the level sets of the hubble ( mean curvature ) time .",
    "o2.2 in     in particular , asymptotically as @xmath60 , the volume fraction in the undeformed region tends to @xmath76 , while in the asymptotic past ( near the big bang ) these regions have a negligible volume fraction .",
    "more general flat spacetimes may be constructed as the future of sets ( e.g. fractals ) in minkowski space , and quotients of these by the action of discrete groups of isometries .",
    "flat , or more generally constant curvature spacetimes are examples of @xmath77-structures and such spacetimes admitting compact cauchy surfaces have been completely analyzed , starting with the work of mess @xcite , see also @xcite , who analyzed the class of constant curvature 2 + 1 dimensional spacetimes admitting a compact cauchy surface . for example",
    ", one may show that the space of flat 2 + 1 dimensional spacetimes with cauchy surface of genus @xmath78 is isomorphic to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is teichmuller space of surfaces of genus @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the thurston boundary . the particular case of constant curvature spacetimes with compact cauchy surface has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown there that such flat spacetimes can be globally foliated by cauchy surfaces of constant mean curvature ( i.e. constant hubble time ) .",
    "the level sets of hubble time can be related to the level sets of the cosmological time by an application of a maximum principle , and one may show that the volume growth of these level sets is comparable to that of the level sets of the cosmological time .",
    "this leads to a generalization of the statements made above for the simple deformed milne universe , see @xcite .    in view of the above",
    "mentioned work , these generalized milne spacetimes may have a very complex ( e.g. fractal ) big bang type initial singularity . in some cases their future asymptotics",
    "can be analyzed , see @xcite .",
    "one finds that the level sets of hubble time decompose into `` neck regions '' with slow volume growth , and `` hyperbolic regions '' with fast volume growth .",
    "the scale free geometry of these level sets may may be depicted as in figure [ fig : hublev ] .",
    "in particular , one finds that in the asymptotically expanding direction , the volume fraction of asymptotically , hyperbolic ( thick ) regions dominate while the neck regions ( thin ) become insignificant .",
    "therefore , a `` typical '' ( volume averaged ) observer at late time lives in a thick region .    it is interesting to compare the relation between the thin and thick regions to the overdense and void regions in an inhomogenous universe containing matter , in particular in view of the fact that the thin regions have volume growth approximating that of einstein - de sitter universe which has critical matter density .",
    "we now consider the generalization of the above picture to the case of general , inhomogenous universes .",
    "we start by noting that the lorentzian einstein equations define a flow on the space of ( scale free ) geometries . by analogy with the ricci flow of riemannian geometries , this may be termed the einstein flow .    for simplicity , we consider spacetimes",

    "motivated by this , we have discussed some results on nonlinear stability for cosmological models .",
    "we end by listing some open problems .",
    "the exponential expansion caused by the presence of the cosmological constant in the case @xmath143 and also in the presence of certain self - gravitating scalar field models for inflation makes the large data future behavior of these models tractable and here there are several results which do not require any symmetry assumtions , see section [ sec : ds ] .    for the case @xmath51 and ordinary matter , the situation is more delicate .",
    "the global behavior of cosmological models is well understood in highly symmetric cases , including the 3 + 1 dimensional friedmann , bianchi , gowdy ( spatial @xmath144 symmetric , with symmetry action generated by hypersurface orthogonal killing fields ) and so - called surface symmetric cases , see @xcite and references therein . for the bianchi case ,",

    "similarly , future stability is open in the 3 + 1 dimensional case for einstein - matter models without symmetry assumptions in the case @xmath51 . as an example",
    ", one would like to prove nonlinear stability of milne for einstein - vlasov .",
    "this is work in progress by the author with d. fajman .",
    "our understanding of the behavior of cosmological models in the direction of the initial singularity is also limited .",
    "the bkl proposal provides a heuristic scenario which has been verified only in the bianchi case , where also strong cosmic censorship has been shown to hold , see above .",
