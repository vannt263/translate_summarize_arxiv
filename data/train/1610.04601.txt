    "the dynamics of tasep on the ring is the same as that of tasep on @xmath3 except the particle at the site @xmath4 , once it jumps , moves to the site @xmath5 if @xmath5 is empty , here the @xmath6 denotes the element @xmath7 in @xmath2 for @xmath8 .",

    "we are interested in the fluctuations of @xmath25 when @xmath30 and @xmath24 both increase of order @xmath31 , and @xmath32 go to infinity proportionally .",
    "the scale @xmath33 is called the relaxation time scale , which was first studied by gwa and spohn @xcite . at this relaxation time scale ,",
    "one expects to see a crossover between the kpz dynamics and the gaussian dynamics and hence the fluctuations are of great interest to both math and physics communities .",
    "the crossover limiting distributions were obtained only recently by prolhac @xcite and baik and liu @xcite . in @xcite , prolhac obtained ( not rigorously ) the limit of the current fluctuations for step , flat and stationary initial conditions in the half particle system ( with the restriction @xmath34 ) .",
    "independently , baik and liu also obtained the limit in a more general setting of @xmath35 and @xmath1 for flat and step initial conditions in @xcite .",

    "hence the limiting distribution obtained in this paper , @xmath37 in theorem  [ thm : limit_height_uniform ] , contains two parameters of time @xmath38 and location @xmath39 , in contrast to that of only time parameter in @xcite .    due to the ring structure ,",

    ". then proposition  [ prop : properties_fu ] follows immediately .",
    "the idea to prove   is to compare the periodic dlpp with the usual dlpp .",
    "this idea was applied in @xcite for periodic tasep in sub - relaxation time scale . in the case we consider in this paper ,",
    "we need a relaxation time analogous of the argument and hence a modification is needed .",
    "we first introduce some known results on dlpp model . the probability space for dlpp",
    "is that all the lattice points @xmath518 are associated with an i.i.d.exponential random variable @xmath517 , we use @xmath533 to denote the probability associated to this space .",
    "similarly to the periodic dlpp , we denote @xmath534 the last passage time from @xmath521 to @xmath518 , and @xmath535 the last passage time from the lattice path @xmath536 to @xmath518 .",
    "finally we define @xmath537 for arbitrary constants @xmath245 satisfying @xmath538 . from now on we fix these two constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 . it is known that @xcite @xmath539 where @xmath540 and @xmath541 . the following tail estimate is also needed , which is due to @xcite , @xmath542 for sufficiently large @xmath543 and @xmath544 satisfying @xmath545 . here",
    "@xmath546 , @xmath458 and @xmath547 are constants only depend on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the last result in dlpp we need is about the transversal fluctuations .",
    "define @xmath548 to be the set of all lattice points @xmath549 satisfying @xmath550 we also define @xmath551 to be the maximal path from @xmath521 to @xmath518 in the usual dlpp .",
    "the following transversal fluctuation estimate is currently known : there exist constants @xmath552 , @xmath553 and @xmath554 such that @xmath555 for all @xmath556 and and @xmath544 satisfying @xmath557 . the analog of this estimate in poissonian version of dlpp was obtained in @xcite and their idea can be applied in the exponential case similarly .",
    "we hence do not provide a proof here , instead we refer the readers to a forthcoming paper @xcite by nejjar for more discussions .",
    "now we use   and   to prove  .",
    "we pick @xmath558 equidistant points @xmath559 on the line @xmath560 such that @xmath561 here @xmath172 is some large parameter which will be decided later .",
    "note that @xmath562 , hence the above inequality is satisfied as long as @xmath172 is greater than certain constant .",
    "now note that @xmath563 since @xmath564 is at the upper right side of to the initial contour @xmath514 by definition , and @xmath565 , therefore @xmath566 on the other hand , by using   we know that @xmath567 provided @xmath568 .",
    "finally , by inserting   and then applying  , we have @xmath569 provided @xmath570 and @xmath532 , where @xmath571 and @xmath405 are constants . by combing  ,   and",
    ", we obtain @xmath572 finally we pick @xmath573 and   follows immediately .",
    "now we assume @xmath240 is large and pick @xmath127 on the following circle @xmath575 we have @xmath576 provided @xmath577 . by tracking the error terms , the term @xmath578 is analytic in @xmath127 and can be expressed as @xmath579 with @xmath580 both bounded by @xmath578 .    and similarly to section  [ sec : asymptotics_determinant ] , we write @xmath581 as @xmath361 whose kernel is defined in  . by a similar argument as lemma  [ lm : estimate_kernel ]",
    ", one can show that the kernel decays exponentially @xmath582 for all @xmath583 and sufficiently large @xmath240 . here",
    "@xmath304 is a constant .",
    "the heuristic argument is as following : suppose @xmath584 with @xmath585 , then @xmath586 by  .",
    "it is a direct to show that the leading term in the exponent of @xmath587 in lemma  [ lm : estimate_kernel ] ( a ) ( after dropping the term @xmath588 , whose real part is independent of @xmath386 and hence cancels with the counterpart from @xmath589 ) is @xmath590 similar estimates for the @xmath589 in lemma  [ lm : estimate_kernel ] ( b ) holds .",
    "therefore we have  .",
    "finally , by using   and  , it is a direct to prove that @xmath591 for a different positive constant @xmath315 .",
