    "entanglement has been a vital physical resource for quantum information processing , such as quantum communication @xcite and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the characterization of entanglement for a given quantum state is a fundamental problem .",
    "bipartite entanglement is well understood in many aspects @xcite .",
    "especially , for two qubits , its mixed state entanglement can be characterized with the help of the so - called concurrence @xcite . however , in multipartite cases , the quantification of entanglement is very complicated and challenging .",
    "a fundamental property of multipartite entangled state is that entanglement is monogamous . in a three - qubit composite system @xmath0",
    ", the monogamy means that there is a trade - off between the amount of entanglement that shared by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . for the pure state @xmath3 , coffman , kundu , and wootters proved the inequality @xmath4 @xcite , where the square of the concurrence @xmath5 quantifies the entanglement of subsystem @xmath6 and the linear entropy @xmath7 measures the pure state entanglement between qubit @xmath8 and remaining qubits @xmath9 .",
    "particularly , the residual quantum correlation in the above equation , _",
    "i.e. , _ the @xmath10-tangle @xmath11 was proven to be a good measure for genuine three - qubit entanglement @xcite . however , in a general case , quantum correlation and quantum entanglement are inequivalent , although both of them are nonnegative and invariant under the local unitary ( lu ) transformation @xcite . for example , in the werner state @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the quantum correlation ( quantum discord ) @xcite is greater than @xmath14 when @xmath15 , but the entanglement ( concurrence ) is nonzero only when @xmath16 .",
    "the key difference between the two quantities is that entanglement does not increase under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , ( i.e. , the entanglement monotone property ) .",
    "recently , osborne and verstraete also proved that the distribution of bipartite entanglement among @xmath17-qubit quantum state satisfies the relation @xcite @xmath18 , where the @xmath19 is the linear entropy for a pure state . comparing with the three - qubit case ,",
    "it is natural to ask _ whether or not the residual quantum correlation in an @xmath17-qubit pure state ( @xmath20 ) is a good measure of the genuine multipartite entanglement . _    in this paper , we attempt to answer the above tough question clearly . based on the quantitative complementary relations ( qcrs )",
    ", we analyze the properties of multipartite correlations and entanglement in four - qubit pure states .",
    "it is shown that the single residual correlation in the four - qubit case does not satisfy the entanglement monotone property .",
    "in addition , the genuine three- and four - qubit correlations are unable to quantify entanglement , either .",
    "finally , in terms of a serious analysis on the sum of all residual correlations , we conjecture it to be an appropriate quantity for constituting the multipartite entanglement measure in the composite system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the properties of multipartite correlations in four - qubit pure states are analyzed in detail . as a result",
    ", a multipartite entanglement measure is conjectured . in sec .",
    "iii , we give some remarks and main conclusions .",
    "in addition , three examples are given in the appendix .",
    "before analyzing the quantum correlations , we first introduce the qcrs .",
    "complementarity @xcite is an essential principle of quantum mechanics , which is often referred to the mutually exclusive properties of a single quantum system . as a special quantum property without classical counterpart ,",
    "entanglement can constitute complementarity relations with local properties @xcite .",
    "jakob and bergou derived a qcr for two - qubit pure state @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath21 , in which the concurrence @xmath22 quantifies the non - local correlation of the two qubits and the @xmath23 is a measure for single particle characters ( @xmath24 is the polarization vector of qubit @xmath25 ) .",
    "the experimental demonstration of this relation was made by peng _",
    "@xcite with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques . for an @xmath17-qubit pure state , the generalized qcrs are also available @xcite @xmath26 where the linear entropy @xmath27 @xcite characterizes the total quantum correlation between qubit @xmath25 and the remaining qubits @xmath28 .",
    "for a two - qubit pure state , the linear entropy is a bipartite quantum correlation . for a three - qubit case , the @xmath29",
    "is composed of the two - qubit and genuine three - qubit correlations @xcite . for an @xmath17-qubit pure state @xcite ,",
    "here we propose a natural generalization that the linear entropy is contributed by different levels of quantum correlations , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 where the @xmath31 represents the genuine @xmath32-qubit quantum correlation , for @xmath33 .    the venn diagram , which is often utilized in the set theory , may be employed to depict quantum correlations in a composite system . here",
    "we draw schematically a correlation venn diagram for a four - qubit pure state @xmath34 in fig.1 .",
    "qubits @xmath8 , @xmath35 , @xmath22 , and @xmath36 are represented by four unit circles , respectively , and the quantum correlations are denoted by the overlapping areas of these circles . according to this diagram , the four - qubit qcrs can be written as @xmath37 where the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the three - qubit correlations in subsystems @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath0 , respectively . in three - qubit pure states ,",
    "the quantum correlations @xmath45 ( square of the concurrence ) and @xmath46 ( 3-tangle ) in the linear entropy are good measures for two- and three - qubit entanglement , respectively .",
    "however , it is an open problem that whether or not the similar relations also hold in a four - qubit pure state @xmath34 .    before analyzing the multipartite correlations @xmath47 and @xmath48s , we need consider how to evaluate the two - qubit correlation @xmath49 in the pure state @xmath34 . similar to the three - qubit case",
    ", we make use of the square of the concurrence which is defined as @xmath50 $ ] , where the decreasing positive real numbers @xmath51s are the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this evaluation is because that the relation @xmath53 holds for the four - qubit @xmath54 state @xmath55 which involves only the two - qubit entanglement @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will analyze the properties of the single residual correlation , the genuine three- and four - qubit correlations , and the sum of all residual correlations , respectively .      under the above evaluation for the two - qubit quantum correlation",
    ", the multipartite correlation around the qubit @xmath25 ( _ i.e. _ , the residual correlation ) will be @xmath56 in which @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "as widely accepted , a good measure for the multipartite entanglement should satisfy the following requirements @xcite : ( 1 ) the quantity should be a non - negative real number ; ( 2 ) it is unchanged under the lu operations ; ( 3 ) it does not increase on average under the locc _",
    "i.e. _ , the measure is entanglement monotone .",
    "now we analyze the residual correlation @xmath59 . according to the monogamy inequality proven by osborne and verstraete @xcite ,",
    "it is obvious that @xmath60 is positive semi - definite .",
    "in addition , for the full separable state and the entangled state involving only two - qubit correlations , it can be verified that @xmath61 .",
    "the last condition is that @xmath59 should be non - increasing on average under the locc .",
    "it is known that any local protocol can be implemented by a sequence of two - outcome povms involving only one party @xcite . without loss of generality , we consider the local povm @xmath62 performed on the subsystem @xmath8 , which satisfies @xmath63 . according to the singular value decomposition @xcite , the povm operators can be written as @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in which @xmath66 and @xmath67 are unitary matrices . since @xmath59 is lu invariant",
    ", we need only to consider the diagonal matrices in the following analysis .",
    "note that the linear entropy and concurrence are invariant under a determinant one stochastic locc ( slocc ) @xcite , we can deduce @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where the @xmath70 $ ] is the normalization factor .",
    "after some algebraic deductions similar to those in refs .",
    "@xcite , the following relation can be derived @xmath71 which means the multipartite correlation @xmath72 is entanglement monotone under the local operation performed on subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the above property is _ not _ sufficient to show the parameter @xmath72 is monotone under the locc .",
    "this is because , unlike the three - qubit case , the residual correlation @xmath59 in a four - qubit state will change after permuting the parties .",
    "therefore , before claiming that the @xmath59 is entanglement monotone , one needs to prove the parameters @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are also non - increasing on average under the povm @xmath62 performed on subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "however , this requirement can not be satisfied in a general case , because the behaviors of the three parameters are quite different from that of @xmath72 . for example , in the correlation @xmath75 , only the @xmath76 is invariant under the determinant one stochastic locc performed on subsystem a. with this property , we know @xmath76 is entanglement monotone .",
    "as to the linear entropy @xmath77 and the other concurrences ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , one can prove that they are decreasing and increasing under the povm @xmath80 , respectively , in terms of the following two facts : first , for the reduced density matrices @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the effect of the povm is equivalent to decomposing them into two mixed states , respectively ; second , the linear entropy is concave function and the concurrence is convex function . comparing the behaviors of @xmath72 and @xmath84 under the povm , we can not ensure that @xmath84 is entanglement monotone ( in the appendix , we give an example in which the correlation @xmath84 will increase under a selected povm performed on subsystem @xmath8 ) .",
    "the cases for @xmath85 and @xmath74 are similar .    for a kind of symmetric quantum state which has the property @xmath86 ,",
    "is the correlation @xmath59 entanglement monotone ?",
    "the answer is still negative .",
    "since the symmetry can not hold after an arbitrary povm , the parameter @xmath59 can not be guaranteed to be monotone under the next level of povm once the property is broken ( see such an example in the appendix ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the correlation @xmath59 is not entanglement monotone and it is not a good entanglement measure .",
    "next , we analyze the properties of the correlations @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that the qcrs provide only four equations which can not determine completely the five multipartite parameters in general . therefore ,",
    "a well - defined measure for @xmath46 or @xmath87 is needed in this case .",
    "recently , an attempt was made to introduce an information measure @xmath88 for the genuine four - qubit entanglement @xcite , but this measure can hardly characterize completely the genuine four - qubit correlation / entanglement @xcite .    on the other hand , a mixed @xmath10-tangle @xmath89 @xcite could not be chosen as the correlation @xmath90 either , because it is not compatible with the qcrs of eq.(4 ) .",
    "as an example , we consider the quantum state @xmath91 @xcite , in which the reduce density matrix @xmath42 can be decomposed to the mix of two pure states @xmath92 and @xmath93 . supposing that the @xmath94 is a good measure for @xmath90",
    ", we can obtain @xmath95 in terms of the definition of the mixed @xmath10-tangle .",
    "then the other multipartite correlations are determined from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "because these correlations are not in the reasonable range , the mixed @xmath10-tangle is not a suitable measure compatible with the qcrs .",
    "although the analytical measures for @xmath47 and @xmath90 are unavailable now , we may analyze a special kind of quantum state in which @xmath47 is zero .",
    "the quantum state @xmath98 is just the case .",
    "suppose that the good correlation measures are existent and their values correspond to the overlapping regions in the venn diagram ( fig.1 ) .",
    "it is simple to see that these correlations are non - negative and lu invariant . in the quantum state @xmath99 , if we let the @xmath48 be the variables , we can obtain the relation @xmath100 according to the qcrs of eq .",
    "( 4 ) . due to the non - negative property of the two correlations",
    ", we can judge the four - qubit correlations is zero in this state .",
    "then the other three - qubit correlations can be solved with the qcrs . in order to test the entanglement monotone of @xmath48 more clearly",
    ", the parameters in @xmath99 are chosen to be @xmath101 ( see the example 3 in the appendix ) .",
    "after performing a selected povm , we find the @xmath39 will increase on average , which implies that the correlations @xmath90 and @xmath47 are not suitable for the quantification of entanglement .",
    "finally , we consider the sum of all residual correlations , which is defined as @xmath102 in which @xmath103 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath104 is nonnegative and lu invariant in terms of the corresponding properties of @xmath59 .",
    "it is extremely difficult to prove the entanglement monotone property analytically .",
    "the main hindrance lies in that one can not compare the change of the concurrences in a general quantum state before and after the povm .",
    "nevertheless , we conjecture that the correlation @xmath104 is an entanglement monotone , as rationalized in some sense below . from the definition of @xmath104",
    ", it is seen that @xmath104 is invariant under the permutations of the subsystems . without loss of the generality ,",
    "suppose that the povm is performed on the subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "in this case , we analyze the behaviors of the components in @xmath104 . according to the prior analysis in eq.(6 ) , the component @xmath105 is decreasing on average .",
    "moreover , due to the concave property of linear entropy and the convex property of concurrence , the component @xmath106 is also decreasing after the povm .",
    "the only increasing component is @xmath107 .",
    "it is conjectured that the decrease of @xmath108 and @xmath109 can countervail the increase of @xmath110 , which results further in the entanglement monotone property of @xmath104 .    in fig.2 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath111 is calculated for nine quantum states @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( the state parameters we choose are listed in table i ) , which are the representative states under the slocc classification ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the form of quantum state @xmath114",
    ", we perform the povm on its subsystem @xmath35 .",
    "for the other states , the povm is performed on the subsystem @xmath8 . from fig.2",
    ", we can see the correlation @xmath104 do not increase on average under the povms , which support our conjecture ( for the povms performed on other subsystems , we obtain the similar results ) . in addition , for the symmetric quantum states @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the second level of the povm is also calculated and the @xmath117 is still nonnegative ( in the first level of the povm performed on the subsystem @xmath8 , the diagonal elements are @xmath118 and @xmath119 ; in the second level of povm , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are chosen from 0.05 to 0.95 , and the interval is 0.01 ) .",
