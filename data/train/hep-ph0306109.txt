    "the weak - boson fusion ( wbf ) process , @xmath3 , is expected to provide a copious sources of higgs bosons in @xmath4-collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "it can be visualized ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn2 ] ) as the elastic scattering of two ( anti-)quarks , mediated by @xmath5-channel @xmath6 or @xmath7-exchange , with the higgs boson radiated off the weak - boson propagator .",
    "together with gluon fusion , it represents the most promising production process for higgs boson discovery  @xcite .",
    "once the higgs boson has been found and its mass determined , the measurement of its couplings to gauge bosons and fermions will be of main interest  @xcite . here",
    "wbf will be of central importance since it allows for independent observation in the @xmath8  @xcite , @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite and @xmath11  invisible  @xcite channels .",
    "this multitude of channels is crucial for separating the effects of different higgs boson couplings .",
    "the wbf measurements can be performed at the lhc with statistical accuracies on cross sections times decay branching ratios , @xmath12 , reaching 5 to 10%  @xcite . in order to extract higgs boson coupling constants with this full statistical power , a theoretical prediction of the standard model ( sm ) production cross section with error well below 10%",
    "is required , and this clearly entails knowledge of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections .    for the total higgs boson production cross section via wbf",
    "these nlo corrections have been available for a decade  @xcite and they are relatively small , with @xmath13-factors around 1.05 to 1.1 . these modest @xmath13-factors are another reason for the importance of higgs boson production via wbf : theoretical uncertainties will not limit the precision of the coupling measurements .",
    "this is in contrast to the dominant gluon fusion channel where the @xmath13-factor is larger than 2 and residual uncertainties of 10 - 20% remain , even after the 2-loop corrections have been evaluated  @xcite .    in order to distinguish the wbf higgs boson signal from backgrounds ,",
    "stringent cuts are required on the higgs boson decay products as well as on the two forward quark jets which are characteristic for wbf .",
    "typical cuts have an acceptance of less than 25% of the starting value for @xmath12 .",
    "the question then arises whether the @xmath13-factors and the scale dependence determined for the inclusive production cross section  @xcite are valid for the higgs boson search region also .",
    "this is best addressed by implementing the one - loop qcd corrections in a fully flexible nlo parton - level monte carlo program .",
    "we are presently developing such programs for a collection of relevant wbf processes , of which higgs boson production , in the narrow resonance approximation , is the simplest example .",
    "the purpose of this paper then is twofold .",
    "first we use the higgs boson signal process as our example to discuss the generic features of nlo qcd corrections to wbf processes .",
    "we use the subtraction method of catani and seymour  @xcite throughout . in section",
    "[ sec : subtraction ] we describe the handling of real emission singularities .",
    "we give explicit formulas for the finite contributions which remain after factorization of the initial - state collinear singularities and after cancellation of divergences produced by soft and collinear final - state gluons against the corresponding terms in the virtual corrections .",
    "this procedure yields a regularized monte carlo program which allows us to determine infrared safe observables at nlo .",
    "the main features of the program , numerical tests , and parameters to be used in the later phenomenological discussion are described in section  [ sec : nlomc ] . in section  [ sec : pheno ] we then use this tool to address our second objective , a discussion of the qcd radiative corrections as a function of jet observables .",
    "we determine the @xmath13-factors and the residual scale uncertainties for distributions of the tagging jets which represent the scattered quarks in wbf .",
    "in addition , we quantify the cross section error induced by uncertainties in the determination of parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "pdf errors and scale variations in the phase - space regions relevant for the higgs boson search turn out to be quite small ( approximately 4% when combined ) and thus indicate the small theoretical uncertainties required for reliable coupling measurements .",
    "conclusion are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "at lowest order , higgs boson production via weak - boson fusion is represented by a single feynman graph , like the one depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : feyn2](a ) for @xmath14 .",
    "we use this particular process to describe the qcd radiative corrections .",
    "generalization to crossed processes ( @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 ) is straightforward . strictly speaking ,",
    "the single feynman graph picture is valid for different quark flavors on the two fermion lines only . for identical flavors annihilation processes , like @xmath17 with subsequent decay @xmath18 or similar @xmath19 production channels , contribute as well . for @xmath20 or @xmath21",
    "the interchange of identical quarks in the initial or final state needs to be considered in principal .",
    "however , in the phase - space regions where wbf can be observed experimentally , with widely separated quark jets of very large invariant mass , the interference of these additional graphs is strongly suppressed by large momentum transfer in the weak - boson propagators .",
    "color suppression further makes these effects negligible . in the following we systematically neglect any identical fermion effects .    at nlo , the vertex corrections of fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn2](b ) and the real emission diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn3 ] must be included . because of the color singlet nature of the exchanged weak boson , any interference terms between sub - amplitudes with gluons attached to both the upper and the lower quark lines vanish identically at order @xmath22 .",

    "figure  [ fig : delyjj ] demonstrates that the wide separation of the tagging jets , which is important for rejection of qcd backgrounds , does survive at nlo . in fact , the tagging jet separation even increases slightly , making a separation cut like @xmath137 even more effective than at lo .    in all distributions",
    "considered so far , no clear preference emerges on whether to choose the weak - boson virtuality , @xmath125 , or @xmath121 as the hard scale . while both choices are acceptable , the transverse momentum distributions show somewhat smaller scale variations for @xmath138 than @xmath139 .",
    "the effect is most pronounced in the high @xmath119 tail of the tagging jet distributions . when considering @xmath140 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptjmax ] , the scale variation increases to @xmath141% at large @xmath119 when @xmath139 is taken , while the same distribution for @xmath138 stays in a narrow @xmath0% band .",
    "this observation provides another reason for our default scale choice , @xmath142 .    unlike the tagging jets considered so far , distributions of the higgs decay products show little change in shape at nlo .",
    "weak - boson fusion processes will play an important role at future hadron colliders , most notably as a probe for electroweak symmetry breaking . for the particular case of higgs boson production ,",
    "we have presented a first analysis of the size and of the remaining uncertainties of nlo qcd corrections to jet distributions in wbf .    as for the inclusive wbf cross section , qcd corrections to distributions are of modest size , of order 10% , but occasionally they reach larger values .",
    "these corrections are strongly phase - space dependent for jet observables and an overall @xmath13-factor multiplying the lo distributions is not an adequate approximation . within the phase - space region relevant for higgs boson searches , we find differential @xmath13-factors as small as 0.9 or as large as 1.3 .",
    "these corrections need to be taken into account for higgs coupling measurements , and our nlo monte carlo program , or the recently released analogous program in the mcfm package  @xcite , provide the necessary tools .",
    "after inclusion of the one - loop qcd corrections , remaining uncertainties due to as yet uncalculated higher order terms , can be estimated by considering scale variations of the nlo cross section . using the higgs boson mass , @xmath121 , and the weak - boson virtuality , @xmath125 , as potential hard scales",
    ", we find that these remaining scale dependencies are quite small .",
    "varying renormalization or factorization scales by a factor of two away from these two central values results in typical changes of the nlo differential cross sections by @xmath0% or less .",
    "the uncertainty bands for @xmath139 and @xmath138 typically overlap , yielding combined scale uncertainties of less than @xmath143% in most cases , occasionally rising up to order 5% at the edges of phase space .",
    "moreover , the variation in different regions typically cancels in the integrated higgs cross section , within cuts , leading to uncertainties due to higher order effects of @xmath0% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigtot ] ) , even when considering different hard scales .",
    "the remaining theoretical uncertainty on the measurable higgs cross section , thus , is well below expected statistical errors , except for the @xmath9 search for higgs masses around 170  gev , where the high lhc rate allows statistical errors as low as 3% .",
    "in addition , pdf uncertainties for the total cross section are of order @xmath144 over the range 100  gev @xmath145 200  gev .",
    "this means that the sm higgs boson production cross section via wbf can be predicted , at present , with a theoretical error of about @xmath146 .",
    "the expected size of the lhc higgs signal is enhanced slightly by the nlo qcd corrections .",
    "in addition to a @xmath13-factor slightly above unity this is due to a small shift of the tagging jets to higher rapidities , still well inside the detector coverage but moving the tagging jets slightly farther apart and hence allowing a better differentiation from qcd backgrounds .",
    "the techniques described in this paper work in a very similar fashion for other weak - boson fusion processes .",
    "we are planning to extend our work to include also @xmath6 and @xmath7 boson production via weak - boson fusion , and to make these programs generally available .",
