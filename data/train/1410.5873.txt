    "as a potentially sensitive probe of chemical reaction dynamics , ultracold molecules show great promise . in gaseous molecular samples whose temperature drops well below the millikelvin range , collision cross sections are no longer thermally averaged over a range of impact parameters ( more properly , partial waves ) .",
    "this circumstance raises the possibility of preparing reactants in individual quantum states of relative motion as well as internal states .",
    "ultracold molecules can moreover be manipulated using electric , magnetic , optical , and microwave fields , extending the reach of state preparation and therefore in principle the detail with which collision experiments can probe reactions  @xcite .",
    "this kind of control has been demonstrated in a prototype experiment , involving krb molecules  @xcite . in this case reaction rates",
    "were tuned by orders of magnitude by exploiting quantum statistics of the molecules , the influence of electric fields , and confinement to optical lattices . in all cases , the key ingredient to controlling",
    "the kinematics of the reactants lay in the manipulation of long - range forces between them .",
    "this aspect of control distinguishes long - range physics , where control is applied , from short - range physics , where the chemistry actually occurs . for this reason , theoretical approaches that seek to understand controlled ultracold chemistry would do well to address the short- and long - range physics separately , yet",
    "be able to weld them together .    while quantum close coupling ( cc ) calculations can handle this disparity in energy scales in principle , the computations become impractically large when all the relevant quantum states and external field effects are included . as a result ,",
    "the vast majority of cc calculations of ultracold reactions ( both barrier and barrierless ) reported so far have been restricted to field - free cases without the inclusion of spin and hyperfine splitting   @xcite . though the theory of chemical reactions for an atom - diatom system in external fields has been formulated by tscherbul and krems  @xcite and applied to the li+hf / lif+h reaction , the computations remain demanding .",
    "an alternative and simplified description , useful at ultralow temperatures , is provided by the multichannel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) .",
    "the formalism was originally developed by seaton and fano  @xcite to understand the spectra of rydberg atoms . since then",
    ", it has been successfully extended to more general contexts  @xcite and applied to both resonant and non - resonant scattering in a variety of atomic collision processes  @xcite , ion - atom collisions  @xcite , atom - molecule systems  @xcite , and molecule - molecule reactive scattering  @xcite .",
    "the method has proven flexible and adept at handling ultralow collision energies and field dependencies , while adequately and simply treating also the short - range physics , which occurs on far greater energy scales .",
    "the mqdt method has been applied to estimate overall reaction rate coefficients of several barrierless reactions  @xcite at far less computational expense in comparison to full cc calculations . however ,",
    "in its current implementation , the method is restricted to estimating the total reaction rate coefficient .",
    "rotational and vibrational populations of the reaction products are not available from these calculations , as these degrees of freedom were not included .",
    "the value of mqdt in ultracold chemistry calculations arises from exploiting the vast disparity between the relevant energy scales . in the cold gas ,",
    "translational kinetic energies of the reactants are on the scale of millikelvin or less .",
    "this energy scale must necessarily be resolved , necessitating a fine energy grid . moreover , applied electric and magnetic fields may influence scattering on this scale , notably by shifting narrow resonances . at the same time , these energy scales are dominant at large interparticle separation between the reactants .",
    "these circumstances play directly to the strengths of mqdt , namely , that a complete description of long - range dynamics can be handled by treating the channels independently , employing the jacobi coordinates between reactants .",
    "doing so can expedite the calculation tremendously , enabling rapid exploration of the sensitively varying energy and field dependence of scattering observables .",
    "by contrast , the reaction itself takes place on , and is calculated using , relatively deep potential energy surfaces ( pess ) of order 10 - 10,000 k. thus over the millikelvin energy range relevant to ultracold chemistry , wave functions of the reaction itself , restricted to the collision complex where all participating atoms are close together , depend only weakly on energy . in this circumstance",
    "the reaction can be handled in complete detail on a far coarser energy grid than required for the final observables .",
    "then the usual techniques of solving the reaction dynamics in hyperspherical coordinates , while computationally heavy , need to be performed at only a handful of energies ( perhaps only one energy , in favorable circumstances ) .",
    "making use of this disparity in energy and length scales necessitates a novel procedure for connecting the short - range physics , described in hyperspherical coordinates @xcite , with the long - range physics , described in jacobi coordinates and exploiting mqdt . describing and evaluating this connection procedure is a main goal of the present paper .",
    "note that in reactive channels , in which large translational energy ( @xmath1mk ) is released , the long - range wave functions are again indifferent to the mk energy scale of reactants .",
    "for this reason , the full mqdt theory need be applied only in the ultracold reactant channels , where the energy sensitivity resides .    in a previous paper  @xcite , we described a hybrid close - coupling mqdt approach for non - reactive scattering in molecule - molecule collisions . here , we extend the formalism to reactive scattering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : theory ] we describe the theoretical formalism .",
    "a brief review of the hyperspherical approach for reactive scattering is presented first to introduce the key terminologies and quantities necessary to describe reactive scattering .",
    "for ease of implementation we use the hyperspherical approach implemented in the abc reactive scattering code  @xcite .",
    "this also enables the interested users to easily implement the formalism into the abc code as it is widely used and publicly available .",
    "the mqdt formalism is described in section [ section : theory]b . in section [ section : d+h2 ]",
    "we discuss the numerical implementation of the approach to the benchmark d+h@xmath2 hd(@xmath3+h reaction with full resolution of the hd product rovibrational quantum states .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "we provide a brief review of the cc formalism for reactive scattering within the delves hyperspherical coordinate ( dc ) system  @xcite .",
    "our discussion of the reactive scattering formalism follows closely the description given by pack and parker  @xcite and tscherbul and krems  @xcite .",
    "the hyperspherical coordinates for three - particle systems involve three internal coordinates ( hyperradius @xmath4 and two hyperangles ) and three external coordinates ( three euler angles ) . in an atom - diatom system , such as a+bc , there are three arrangement channels corresponding to a+bc , ab+c and ac+b atom - diatom combinations .",
    "these three arrangement channels are denoted by the index @xmath5 in our notation .",
    "the hyperradius @xmath4 and hyperangle @xmath6 in dc can be written in terms of two mass - scaled jacobi distances ( @xmath7 ) through a polar transformation : @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the atom - diatom center - of - mass distance and internuclear separation of the diatom for a given atom - diatom arrangement .",

    "this involves partitioning the hyperradius into a large number of sectors , and within each sector , diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath25 in the remaining degrees of freedom : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the total number of adiabatic states retained in the calculation . in the limit @xmath29",

    "the quantum numbers @xmath38 and @xmath39 specify the total angular momentum ( @xmath40 ) and its projection on a space - fixed ( sf ) axis .",
