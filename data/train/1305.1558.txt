    "we will consider a parallel beam translation system ( dogleg ) where a bend magnet block ( arc ) which is symmetric about the horizontal midplane @xmath0 is followed by its rotated by @xmath1 about the longitudinal axis image .    in order to design a dogleg which does not give rise to the unacceptable emittance dilution due to chromatic effects one has to control both , dogleg nonlinear dispersions and dogleg chromatic focusing properties , and that can be done using the following observations :",
    "let us assume that the arc transport matrix is free from the linear dispersions and its horizontal focusing part is equal to the two by two identity matrix . then in the dogleg transfer map the second order dispersions",
    "are automatically canceled .",
    "if we will add to these assumptions the requirement that the arc map is a second order achromat , we will obtain dogleg which is a second order achromat by itself and in which the first nonzero dispersions are at least of fifth order .",
    "these observations were used during design of a beam transport system for the tesla x - ray facility and allowed to work out dogleg with the energy acceptance which definitely is not smaller than @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the sextupoles used in that dogleg are essential for achieving such large energy acceptance and play a twofold role .",
    "they are responsible for both , control of chromatic focusing aberrations by making the arc to be a second order achromat and for absence of nonlinear dispersions up to fifth order .    nevertheless , as concerning suppression of nonlinear dispersions alone , then the tuning of the arc to be a complete second order achromat is not necessary .",
    "it is sufficient to make it a second order achromat only with respect to the bending plane ( horizontal ) motion ( i.e. to make the horizontal components of the arc map free from the second order chromatic and geometric aberrations on the manifold @xmath3 ) and thus to reduce the number of sextupoles required for cancellation of third and fourth order dispersions by a factor of two .",
    "the additional possibilities for dispersion cancellation we will obtain , if we will assume that the arc is constructed by a repetition of @xmath4 identical cells ( @xmath5 ) with the arc horizontal focusing matrix equal to the two by two identity matrix and with the cell horizontal focusing matrix not equal to the two by two identity matrix ( which guarantees that the arc transport matrix is automatically free from the linear dispersions ) . in this case let us summarize the rules for the dispersion suppression as follows :    * without any additional assumptions the second order dogleg dispersions are equal to zero .",
    "* if the arc cell is free form the linear dispersions , then the second and the third order dogleg dispersions are equal to zero .",
    "* if the arc map is a second order achromat with respect to the horizontal motion , then the second , the third and the fourth order dogleg dispersions are equal to zero .",
    "* if the arc map is a second order achromat with respect to the horizontal motion and the arc cell is free form the linear dispersions , then the second , the third , the fourth and the fifth order dogleg dispersions are equal to zero .",
    "one sees from the above list that it is not a big problem to construct dogleg without sextupoles which , nevertheless , is free from first , second and third order dispersions , but what is it possible to do in this case ( or in the case when the arc map is a second order achromat only with respect to the horizontal motion ) in order to control chromatic focusing aberrations ?",
    "one possible way is to employ concept of apochromatic focusing which , though have been developing mostly for straight drift - quadrupole systems  @xcite , can be generalized on the systems with bending and sextupole magnets included .",
    "in this section we will present three solutions for the xfel injector dogleg designed according to the discussed above optical principles .",
    "the first solution ( dogleg variant one ) is the dogleg which originally was designed for the xfel injector  @xcite .",
    "the second solution ( dogleg variant two ) is the slight modification of the first and has better chromatic properties with sextupoles switched off . the third solution ( dogleg variant three ) utilizes much smaller number of magnets than the first two , does not uses sextupoles at all , but still has an energy acceptance of the order of @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "it is perspective solution and , if the practical operations with the first xfel injector will show that provided by it energy acceptance is sufficient , then probably this dogleg will be realized for the usage with the second xfel injector .",
    "the doglegs variant one and variant two use the same number of magnets and have very similar layouts and betatron functions ( fig.1 and fig.2 ) .",
    "arcs of both doglegs are first order achromats , i.e. their transport matrices are equal to the identity matrix except for the @xmath8 element for the dogleg variant two .",
    "they can be tuned to become second order achromats with respect to the bending plane ( in this paper , horizontal ) motion using two sextupole families and are constructed as two cell systems , where each cell is mirror symmetric with respect to its center and has the same arrangement of dipole and quadrupole magnets as the cell of the arc of the xfel post - linac collimation section  @xcite .",
    "what makes these two doglegs different , it is behavior of their linear dispersions . for the dogleg variant two",
    "it is closed already after one arc cell ( fig.3 ) . as the result of that even with sextupoles switched off the dogleg variant two",
    "has an energy acceptance of the order of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , while the dogleg variant one seems to be nonoperational ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the price paid for this dispersion adjustment is that while the dogleg variant one is first order isochronous beamline with @xmath9 , the dogleg variant two has @xmath10 ( with the same sign as for the usual four - bend magnetic chicane ) and will make slight beam compression during its transport , but currently it is considered even as an advantage in comparison with the dogleg variant one .       and @xmath11 ellipses ( matched at the entrance ) after tracking through the dogleg variant one ( top ) and the dogleg variant two ( bottom ) .",
    "the relative energy deviations are equal to @xmath6 .",

    "this dogleg uses essentially smaller number of magnets than the first two doglegs presented in this paper , which is achieved by reduction of the phase advance of the vertical motion by a factor of two in comparison with the horizontal motion .",
    "the horizontal focusing part of the arc transfer matrix for this dogleg is equal to the two by two identity matrix , while its vertical focusing part is equal to the two by two minus identity matrix .",
    "similar to the dogleg variant two the dogleg variant three will make slight beam compression during its transport ( @xmath13 ) and has the linear dispersion which is closed already after one arc cell .",
