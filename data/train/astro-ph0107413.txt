    "the weak distortions of the images of distant galaxies by intervening matter ( cosmic shear ) provide an important tool to study the projected mass distribution in the universe .",

    "various detections of this cosmic shear signal have been reported ( e.g. , bacon et al . 2000 ; kaiser et al .",

    "other studies have concentrated on the dark matter halo properties of galaxies ( e.g. , brainerd et al . 1996",
    "; hudson et al . 1998 ; fischer et al . 2000 ; wilson et al . 2000 ; hoekstra 2000 ) .",
    "of these studies , fischer et al . ( 2000 ) were the first to measure the lensing signal with high accuracy .",
    "they used the averaged tangential distortion around their sample of lens galaxies to study the galaxy - mass correlation function , which allowed them to investigate the ratio of the bias parameter @xmath2 ( e.g. , kaiser 1987 ) and the galaxy - mass correlation coefficient @xmath3 ( e.g. , pen 1998 ; dekel & lahav 1999 ) .",
    "other observational constraints of biasing come from dynamical measurements ( see strauss & willick 1995 ) which provide a measurement of the parameter @xmath13 on relatively large scales ( @xmath14 a few mpc ) .",
    "current measurements yield @xmath15 ( see the compilation by berlind et al . 2001 ; peacock et al 2001 ) which suggest for @xmath16 that @xmath17 .    the combination of high resolution cosmological @xmath18-body simulations and semi - analytic modelling of galaxy formation has been used to predict galaxy biasing as a function of scale ( e.g. , benson et al . 2000 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "these studies find that on scales @xmath19 mpc the galaxies are less clustered than the dark matter , although the results depend on the specific clustering properties for different types of galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "a measurement of the galaxy biasing as a funcion of scale is important as it can be used to rule out models of galaxy formation , thus improving our understanding of this complex process .",
    "schneider ( 1998 ) proposed a method that provides the unique opportunity to measure @xmath2 and @xmath3 as a function of scale .",
    "this has been studied in more detail by van waerbeke ( 1998 ) who concluded that the results depend only slightly on the assumed power spectrum of density fluctuations .    in this letter",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of weak gravitational lensing for studies of galaxy biasing .",
    "we use @xmath5-band imaging data from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) ( e.g. , gladders & yee 2000 ) , which is a 100 deg@xmath4 galaxy cluster survey designed to provide a large sample of optically selected clusters of galaxies with redshifts @xmath20 .",
    "we use 16 deg@xmath4 of @xmath5-band imaging data from the rcs taken with the cfht 12k mosaic ccd camera .",
    "the integration times are 900s per pointing with seeing ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",

    "the cfht part of the rcs consists of 10 widely separated patches of @xmath23 degrees .",
    "here we use 52 pointings of the cfh12k camera , typically 5 pointings from each patch .",
    "the data analysed so far do not cover complete patches , and therefore we limit the analysis to the individual pointings .    for the weak lensing analysis we use the scheme outlined in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 1998 ; 2000 ) , which is based on the method described in kaiser , squires , & broadhurst ( 1995 ) and luppino & kaiser ( 1997 )",
    ". a detailed discussion of the object analysis and its accuracy is described in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , where we present our measurement of cosmic shear .",
    "the results indicate that the object analysis , and the necessary corrections for observational distortions work well , which allows us to obtain accurate measurements of the weak lensing signal .    for the analysis presented here",
    ", we select a sample of lenses and sources on the basis of their apparent @xmath5 magnitude .",
    "we use galaxies with @xmath6 as lenses , and galaxies with @xmath7 as sources which are used to measure the lensing signal .",
    "this selection yields a sample of 36226 lenses and @xmath24 sources .",
    "to study the galaxy biasing as a function of scale , we essentially measure the ratio of the cross - correlation between mass and galaxies , and the galaxy auto - correlation function .",
    "the method is described in detail in schneider ( 1998 ) and van waerbeke ( 1998 ) , and we discuss it only briefly here .",
    "the aperture mass is defined as ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 )    @xmath25    if @xmath26 is a compensated filter , i.e. , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 for @xmath29 , the aperture mass statistic @xmath30 can be directly expressed in terms of the ( in the weak lensing regime ) observable tangential shear @xmath31    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    we will take ( schneider 1998 ; van waerbeke et al . 2001 )    @xmath34 \\left[\\frac{1}{3}-\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\theta_{\\rm ap}}\\right)^2\\right],\\ ] ]    with the corresponding @xmath35    @xmath36.\\ ] ]    the real bias relation can be complicated as it depends on the process of galaxy formation ( e.g. , dekel & lahav 1999 ) , but in the standard , deterministic , linear bias theory , the galaxy density contrast @xmath37 is related to the mass density contrast @xmath38 as ( e.g. , kaiser 1987 ) @xmath39 , and the number density contrast of galaxies is given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the average number density of lens galaxies , @xmath42 is the comoving distance , @xmath43 is the comoving angular diameter distance , and where @xmath44 corresponds to the redshift distribution of lens galaxies .",
    "we define the filtered number counts @xmath45 as ( schneider 1998 )    @xmath46    for our choice of the filter function @xmath26 we define the ` filtered ' power spectrum @xmath47 as ( e.g. , schneider et al .",
    "1998 )    @xmath48 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is the time - evolving 3-d power spectrum , and @xmath50 is the fourth order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "as has been shown by jain & seljak ( 1997 ) , it is important to use the non - linear power spectrum in the calculations , for which the results from peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) are used .",
    "we can write the auto - correlation of @xmath51 as ( schneider 1998 ; van waerbeke 1998 )    @xmath52    and the cross - correlation @xmath53 as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the density parameter , and @xmath56 is the cosmic expansion factor .",
    "schneider ( 1998 ) and van waerbeke ( 1998 ) used the simple , deterministic , linear biasing theory , which assumes a perfect correlation between the galaxy and mass density fields .",
    "however , as pointed out by pen ( 1998 ) , and dekel & lahav ( 1999 ) , the biasing relation need not be deterministic , but might be stochastic . in this case",
    "the galaxy - mass cross - correlation coefficient @xmath3 is less than 1 .",
    "hence , we allow for stochastic biasing , and include the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the function @xmath57 depends on the redshift distribution of the ( background ) sources @xmath58 as    @xmath59    the predicted correlations @xmath60 and @xmath61 depend on the choice of the power spectrum .",
    "van waerbeke ( 1998 ) showed that the ratio    @xmath62    depends little on the choice of power spectrum , provided that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are independent of scale . in this case , the ratio only depends on @xmath55 and @xmath63 , and is constant with scale , which obviously does not alter the conclusion that @xmath64 is constant with scale ] .",
    "thus we can write    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is a constant for a given cosmology .",
    "thus the measurement of @xmath64 as a function of scale provides a unique way to examine whether @xmath8 depends on scale or not .",
    "in fact , weak gravitational lensing allows one to estimate @xmath2 and @xmath3 separately , when the ratio @xmath67 is also measured .",
    "although this ratio is not constant with scale , @xmath68 does not depend much on the assumed power spectrum ( in particular on scales less than 10 arcmin . ) .",
    "unfortunately our data are not sufficient to obtain a good measurement of @xmath69 , but with more data we will be able to measure both @xmath3 and @xmath2 as a function of scale .",
    "in order to interpret the observed value of @xmath64 , we have to evaluate equations  9 and  10 , which requires knowledge of the redshift distributions of the lens galaxies and the source galaxies .    for the sample of lens galaxies we use the redshift distribution found from the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "1999 ; yee et al .",
    "2000 ; carlberg et al .",
    "the cnoc2 survey provides a well determined ( spectroscopically ) redshift distribution for field galaxies down to @xmath70 , which is ideal , given our limits of @xmath6 .",
    "the adopted redshift distribution gives a median redshift @xmath71 for the lens galaxies .",
    "for the source galaxies the situation is more complicated .",
    "these galaxies are generally too faint for spectroscopic surveys , although recently cohen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measured spectroscopic redshifts around the hubble deep field north down to @xmath72 .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the spectroscopic redshifts agree well with the photometric redshifts derived from multi color photometry .",
    "because of likely field - to - field variations in the redshift distribution , we prefer to use the photometric redshift distributions derived from both hubble deep fields ( fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 ; chen et al .",
    "photometric redshift distributions generally work well , as has been demonstrated by hoekstra et al .",
    "this redshift distribution yields a median redshift of @xmath73 for the source galaxies .",
    "we computed the value of @xmath64 for a range of cosmological parameters , and find that , for the adopted redshift distributions , @xmath64 can be approximated with fractional accuracy of 2% using    @xmath74.\\ ] ]",
    "to measure @xmath61 and @xmath75 from the data we use the estimators for @xmath30 and @xmath76 introduced by schneider ( 1998 )    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are respectively the number of lens and source galaxies found in the aperture of radius @xmath80 .",
    "the weights @xmath81 correspond to the inverse square of the uncertainty in the shape measurement ( see hoekstra et al . 2000 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the observed value of @xmath82 as a function of aperture size is presented in figure  [ ratio]a .",
    "we note that the points are somewhat correlated .",
    "a significant signal is detected at all scales .",
    "the results are consistent with a value of @xmath64 that is constant with scale , which implies that @xmath8 is constant as well .",
    "this is an important result , as the smallest scales we are probing are comparable to the sizes of galaxy halos . we obtain an average value of @xmath83 , where we have used the covariance matrix to account for the correlation between the points at different scales .    to examine possible systematic effects",
    ", we also computed @xmath84 when the galaxies are rotated by 45 degrees .",
    "this signal should vanish in the case of lensing .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ ratio]b are consistent with no signal , indicating that the corrections for the systematic distortions have worked well ( more details will be provided in hoekstra et al .",
    "2001 ) . as another check",
    ", we correlated @xmath45 for each field with @xmath85 of the other pointings , and find that the signal also vanishes in this case .    in figure  [ bias ]",
    "we present the resulting value of @xmath8 as a function of aperture radius for the currently favored cosmology @xmath86 . in this case",
    "we find @xmath10 .",
    "for an open model @xmath87 we obtain @xmath88 . for comparison",
    ", we have also indicated the effective physical scale ( @xmath89 fwhm of the filter function ) probed by the compensated filter @xmath26 at the median redshift of the lenses @xmath90 .",
    "a direct comparison with dynamical studies is difficult because different galaxy types cluster differently and because of the different scales probed in our study .",
    "however , our results are in fair agreement with the results from dynamical studies , in the sense that we find @xmath91 ( e.g. , berlind et al .",
    "2001 ; peacock et al .",
    "therefore from scales ranging from @xmath92 mpc out to @xmath11 mpc , i.e. from the scales of galaxy halos out to the linear regime , the measurements are consistent with a value @xmath91 , suggesting that the light distribution traces the dark matter distribution quite well .",
    "for the first time we have measured the parameter @xmath8 as a function of scale using weak lensing using 16 deg@xmath4 of data from the red - sequence cluster survey . with the analysis of the full survey",
    ", the errorbars are expected to decrease by a factor @xmath93 , thus improving the constraints on possible variation of @xmath8 with scale .",
    "also we will be able to probe larger scales , as we have limited the analysis to the individual pointings , rather than the full patches which are @xmath23 degrees .",
    "other cosmic shear surveys will place additional constraints , eventually allowing us to measure @xmath3 and @xmath2 separately as a function of scale .",
    "the lens galaxies were selected on the basis of their apparent magnitude , but with planned multi - color photometry , it is also possible to measure the biasing properties as a function of galaxy type or luminosity ( using photometric redshifts ) . eventually , using bigger surveys , it might even be possible to study the evolution of galaxy biasing as a function of redshift .",
