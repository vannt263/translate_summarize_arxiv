    "the nature of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) was a mystery for the past 20 years , since the discovery of the first example ( 1e  2259.1 + 586 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are currently only five confirmed axps , all of which are located in the galactic plane , with two at the geometric centers of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "axp characteristics can be summarized as follows ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) : they exhibit x - ray pulsations in the range @xmath3612  s ; they have pulsed x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 ; they spin down regularly ; they have spectra that are characterized by thermal emission of @xmath6  kev plus a hard power - law tail . they have faint or no optical / ir counterparts @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart of one axp , 4u  0142 + 61 is reportedly pulsed @xcite .",
    "axps are called `` anomalous '' because it has been unclear what powers their radiation .",
    "they are not rotation - powered as their observed x - ray luminosities are much greater than the rate of loss of rotational kinetic energy inferred from their spin - down .",
    "they were long thought to be accreting from a low mass companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however this model is difficult to reconcile with observations : the absence of doppler shifts even on short time scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the absence of a detectable optical / ir companion or bright accretion disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the apparent associations with supernova remnants , that axp spectra are very different from those of known accreting sources , and that @xmath7 is generally smaller than in known accreting sources , all are inconsistent with this scenario .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposed that axps are accreting from a fossil disk made of fall - back material from the supernova . however , this model overpredicts the observed optical / ir flux from the disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the main source of free energy for axp emission is from the magnetic field itself . in this model ,",
    "axps are young , isolated , highly magnetized neutron stars or `` magnetars '' .",
    "prior to our _ rxte _ monitoring campaign , the primary evidence in favor of this model for axps was the inferred strength of the surface dipolar magnetic field required to slow the pulsar down _ in vacuo _ , assuming magnetic dipole braking as in radio pulsars .",
    "these fields are in the range @xmath8  g. the spin - down ages in this model , inferred assuming a small birth spin period , are in the range @xmath28200  kyr . this suggested youth is further evidenced by the associations with supernova remnants , and from the location of axps in the galactic plane .",
    "the identification of axps with magnetars was further strongly motivated by the similarity of axp emission to that of the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) in quiescence .",
    "specifically , the latter have similar pulse periods , are spinning down @xcite , and have x - ray spectra that are comparable to , though somewhat harder than , those of the axps , at least when not in outburst @xcite .",
    "independent evidence for the ultra - high magnetic fields exists in sgrs ; for example , a @xmath9  g magnetic field is required to confine the radiation that is seen following major outbursts @xcite .",
    "indeed the only strong distinction between the emission from sgrs and axps appeared to be the fact that sgrs exhibit occasional and repeating short bursts , while axps did not .",
    "the results presented here were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board nasa s _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "the pca consists of an array of five collimated xenon / methane multi - anode proportional counter units operating in the 2    60  kev range , with a total effective area of approximately @xmath10 and a field of view of @xmath11  fwhm . a program to monitor axps regularly using _ rxte _  was begun in 1996 in order to determine their long - term timing , pulsed flux , and pulse profile stabilities @xcite . as part of this program , motivated by the existence of sgr bursts , we also searched the axp data for bursts @xcite .",
    "our observations consist primarily of short snapshots taken on a monthly basis .",
    "in addition , we used a handful of archival observations ; the exposures in these observations vary .",
    "we used the ` goodxenonwithpropane ` data mode , which records photon arrival times with 1-@xmath12s resolution and bins energies into one of 256 channels .",

    "resulting pulse profiles were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise template created by adding phase - aligned profiles from previous observations .",
    "the cross - correlation returns an average pulse time - of - arrival ( toa ) for each observation corresponding to a fixed pulse phase .",
    "the pulse phase @xmath13 at any time @xmath14 can be expressed as a taylor expansion ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the pulse frequency , @xmath17 , etc . and",

    "the toas were fit to the above polynomial using the pulsar timing software package ` tempo ` .",
    "unambiguous pulse numbering is made possible by obtaining monitoring observations spaced so that the best - fit model parameters have a small enough uncertainty to allow prediction of the phase of the next observation to within @xmath20 .",
    "typically this requires two closely spaced observations ( within a few of hours of each other ) followed by one spaced a few days later , and regular monitoring thereafter , as long as phase coherence can be maintained .    using phase coherent timing",

    "however , the very noisy timing behavior seen in 1e  1048.15937  shows no evidence for correlated flux variations , as are expected in fall - back disk models .",
    "motivated by a previous report of a significant pulse morphology change in an axp ( 1e  2259.1 + 586 ; * ? ? ?",

    "morphology changes are expected in the magnetar model during outbursts or torque variations .    to search for pulse profile changes ,",
    "the profiles were first phase aligned using the templates and the same cross - correlation procedure used for timing .",
    "each data profile was fit to a high signal - to - noise template by adjusting the amplitude and the offset in order to minimize a @xmath21 statistic .",
    "the resulting data profile was subtracted from the template to yield `` profile residuals '' for each observation .",
    "the procedure was repeated for each pulsar with different binning in order to have sensitivity to a variety of types of pulse profile changes .",
    "we have not detected any large pulse profile variations , except for 1e  2259.1 + 586  during a major outburst ( see below ) .",
    "this justifies our other analysis procedures which assume a fixed profile .",
    "however , in a handful of observations , we have found low - level pulse profile changes , at the @xmath22 level for all sources .",
    "it is difficult to set quantitative upper limits on the amplitude of pulse profile changes to which we were sensitive , as these depend on the shape of the change , and vary depending on the length of the observation .",
    "typically , rms profile residuals are @xmath220% of the pulse peak , although this varied from 440% .",
    "we have also used our _ rxte _",
    "observations to monitor the pulsed flux of each axp . by considering the stability of pulsed fluxes ,",
    "we test the two competing axp models . in accreting systems ,",
    "torque fluctuations are generally accompanied by variation in the mass accretion rate and hence luminosity , and vice versa . in the magnetar model",
    ", abrupt flux changes could occur in analogy with sgr - like outbursts .",
    "given the large field - of - view of the pca , the low count rates for the sources relative to the background , and the fact that , for example , 1e  2259.1 + 586  is in a supernova remnant , total flux measurements are difficult with our _ rxte _  data .",
    "instead , we have determined the pulsed component of the flux , by using the off - pulse emission as a background estimator .",
    "data from each observing epoch were folded at the expected pulse period as was done for the timing analysis .",
    "however , for the flux analysis , 16 phase bins were used across the pulse . for each phase bin",
    ", we maintained a spectral resolution of 128 bins over the pca range .",
    "given the broad morphologies of the average pulse profile , only one phase bin could be used as a background estimator .",
    "the pulse profiles were phase aligned , so that the same off - pulse bin was used for background in every case .",
    "the remaining phase bins were summed , and their spectral bins regrouped using the ` ftool ` ` grppha ` .",
    "the regrouped , phase - summed data sets , along with the background measurement , were used as input to the x - ray spectral fitting software package ` xspec ` .",
    "response matrices were created using the ` ftool`s ` xtefilt ` and ` pcarsp ` . because of the limited statistics , fitting a two - component model was not practical , so we used a simple photoelectrically absorbed power law , at first holding only @xmath23 fixed .",
    "for all sources we found that the photon index @xmath24 was constant within the uncertainties ; we therefore held it fixed at its mean value . to extract a pulsed flux at each observing epoch we refit each spectrum by varying only the normalization .",
    "other than after a major outburst from 1e  2259.1 + 586  ( see below ) , we found no evidence for any large variability in the pulsed flux within 20%30% consistent with the systematic errors .",
    "axp spectra are generally best fit by a two - component model consisting of a photoelectrically absorbed blackbody with a hard power - law tail ( israel et al .",
    "whether these two components are physically distinct is an open question @xcite . to investigate this , we compared the pulse profile morphology of the axps in two energy bands .",
    "thus far , we have found that pulse profile energy - dependence is generally subtle , but varies from source to source .",
    "we found no clear patterns when considering average pulse profiles as a function of energy @xcite .      in the magnetar model for sgrs @xcite , bursts are a result of sudden crustal yields due to stress from the outward diffusion of the huge internal magnetic field .",
    "such yields cause crust shears which twist the external magnetic field , releasing energy .",
    "@xcite who , upon suggesting that axps are also magnetars , predicted x - ray bursts should eventually be seen from them . in order to confirm this prediction we searched our _ rxte _  data for bursts",
    "our burst searching algorithm is summarized below ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "time series were created with 31.25-ms resolution from photons having energies in the range 220  kev for each pca proportional counter unit ( pcu ) separately , using all xenon layers .",
    "photon arrival times at each epoch were adjusted to the solar system barycentre .",
    "the resulting time series were searched for significant excursions from the mean count rate by comparing each time bin value with a windowed 7-s running mean .",
    "bursts were identified assuming poissonian statistics , and by combining probabilities from the separate pcus .",
    "we discovered two short , highly significant x - ray bursts , separated by 16 days , from the direction of the axp 1e  1048.15937  in data from fall 2001 @xcite .",
    "the first occurred during a 3-ks pca observation obtained on 2001 october 29 , and the second during a 3-ks observation obtained on 2001 november 14 .",
    "we searched a total of 442  ks of pca observing time from 19962002 , and no other significant bursts were found toward 1e  1048@xmath255937 .",

    "as seen in figure  [ fig : spec1048 ] , the spectrum for the 1  s after the burst 1 onset exhibits a feature near 14  kev .",
    "this feature is clear in all binning schemes and is prominent throughout the first @xmath21  s of the burst .",
    "no known pca instrumental effect produces a feature at this energy ( k. jahoda , personal communication ) .",
    "intriguingly , in some spectral binning schemes , we saw hints of features in the spectrum consistent with additional multiples of 7  kev , suggesting cyclotron lines .",
    "however these were not statistically significant .",
    "due to the wide ( @xmath21@xmath26 ) field - of - view ( fov ) and lack of imaging capabilities of the pca , we can not verify that the bursts originated from the location of the axp .",
    "the low peak x - ray fluxes of the events ( see table 1 ) preclude determining the source s location using data from other , better imaging instruments that were contemporaneously observing the x - ray sky , such as the _ rxte _ all sky monitor , or the wide field camera aboard _",
    "bepposax_. we must therefore consider other possible origins from the bursts before concluding they were from the axp .",
    "the bursts short rise times ( table  1 ) require emission regions of less than a few thousand km , implying a compact object origin .",
    "type i bursts from an lmxb in the same fov as 1e  1048.15937  are unlikely to explain our observed bursts because ( i ) the burst rise times are much shorter than those of type i bursts ; ( ii ) the burst spectra are much harder than those of type i bursts ; ( iii ) burst 2 shows no evidence for spectral softening with time and no type i burst has ever exhibited a spectral feature like the one detected in burst 1 ; ( iv ) the bursts are extremely faint , implying a source location well outside the milky way for type i burst luminosities ( v ) there are no known lmxbs in the fov @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bursts we have observed are unlikely to be type ii bursts from an unknown x - ray binary in the pca fov because ( i ) of the rarity of such events ( observed thus far only in two sources , both accreting binaries ) ; ( ii ) type ii bursts have longer rise times than do our bursts ; ( iii ) no type ii burst has exhibited a spectral feature like that seen in burst 1 .",
    "classical gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) sometimes exhibit prompt x - ray emission that can have temporal and spectral signatures similar to those we have observed@xcite .",
    "however , the likelihood of two grbs occurring within @xmath27 of each other is small , and grbs are not known to repeat .",
    "the observed burst properties are in many ways similar to those seen from sgrs @xcite . the fast rise and",
    "slow decay profiles are consistent with sgr time histories , as are the burst durations . both axp and sgr bursts are spectrally much harder than is their quiescent pulsed emission .",
    "the burst peak fluxes and fluences fall within the range seen for sgrs , and the spectrum of burst 2 is consistent with sgr burst spectra of comparable fluence .",
    "burst 1 has characteristics unlike nearly all sgr bursts , specifically its long tail ( table  1 ) and spectral feature .",
    "however , we note that one event from sgr  1900 + 14 was shown @xcite to possess each of these properties .",
    "the marginal increase in the pulsed flux that we observed at the burst epochs is consistent with sgr pulsed flux increases seen during bursting episodes @xcite . finally , the fact that in spite of several years of monitoring , the only two bursts detected occurred within two weeks of each other suggests episodic bursting activity , the hallmark of sgrs . thus , the characteristics of these events match the burst properties of sgrs far better than any other known burst phenomenon .    the large 14-kev spectral line in the first burst in intriguing .",
    "an electron cyclotron feature at this energy @xmath28 implies a magnetic field of @xmath29  g ( where @xmath30 is the electron mass , @xmath31 is the speed of light , @xmath32 is planck s constant , and @xmath33 is the electron charge ) , while a proton cyclotron feature implies @xmath34  g. the former is significantly lower than is implied from the source s spin - down and is typical of conventional young neutron stars , rather than magnetars .",
    "the latter is higher than is implied by the spin - down yet reasonable for the magnetar model as the spin - down torque is sensitive only to the dipolar component of the magnetic field .    [",

    "the association of the bursts toward 1e  1048.15937  with the axp could not be unambiguously verified , however , the bursts seen here ( figure  [ fig : b2259 ] ; top panel ) clearly originated from 1e  2259.1 + 586 . during and following the outburst ,",
    "the pulsed flux increased ( see figure  [ fig : b2259 ] ) and there was a significant pulsed morphology change , such that the relative amplitude of the leading and trailing pulse were swapped ( see figure  [ fig : pulse2259 ] ) .",
    "target - of - opportunity observations were made by many major observatories in addition to _ rxte _ at the time of this outburst .",
    "no radio emission was detected in spite of sensitive _ vla _ observations , nor were any bursts seen in too _ xmm - newton _ data obtained roughly a week afterward .",
    "near - infrared observations obtained with the gemini north 8-m reflector on june 21 showed that the proposed ir counterpart had brightened by a factor of 3.4 ( kaspi et al .",

    "this represents the first detection of transient optical / ir emission from an isolated neutron star .",
    "subsequently , @xcite reported possible ir variability from the proposed counterpart to 1e  1048.1@xmath255937 , which they suggested might be related to its bursting behaviour .",
    "the origin of ir emission is currently not addressed in the magnetar model .",
    "pulse morphology changes can occur , according to the magnetar model , during outbursts as in the sgrs , as this is when magnetic reconfigurations occur .",

    "we noted a marginal ( @xmath22 ) increase in the pulsed flux from 1e  1048.1@xmath255937 that commenced with the observation in which burst  1 was detected , and which lasted @xmath24  weeks @xcite .",

    "* ) , although the reported fluxes were measured with different instruments having very different spectral responses and angular resolutions . if correct , these past claims of increased flux might imply previous bursting activity .",

    "rxte_. there is now strong evidence that axps are magnetars .",
    "the great rotationally stability in some axps is at odds with an accretion scenario , as is the absence of pulsed flux or pulse morphology changes correlated with torque .",
    "extended periods of spin - up would only , though not necessarily , be expected in an accretion scenario , however all axps have exhibited relatively steady spin - down .",
    "furthermore , and perhaps most compellingly , accretion models can not account for the bursting episodes seen in two axps .",
    "interestingly , there is a correlation between timing stability and @xmath0 in our data .",
    "the sources with by far the smallest @xmath0 s , are the most stable in quiescence ( at least during our observations ) , while those with large @xmath0 s are less so .",
    "the sgrs , being even less stable @xcite , have even larger @xmath0 s , in agreement with this trend .",
    "if correct , the trend suggests a continuum of timing properties between the axp and sgr populations , lending additional support to the connection between them .",
    "the identification with magnetars is further strongly motivated by the similarity of the axp emission to that of the sgrs .",
    "specifically , the latter have similar pulse periods , are spinning down @xcite , and have x - ray spectra that are comparable to , though somewhat harder than , those of the axps , at least when not in outburst . with the detection of x - ray bursts from two axps the two classes are now similar in that respect as well .",
    "these very recent results appear to have sealed the connection between sgrs and axps , as was originally predicted by @xcite .",
    "however , the identification of the two classes objects as magnetars has left some open questions .",
    "for instance , what if anything distinguishes axps and sgrs ? are axps the progenitors of sgrs or vice versa ?",
    "recently @xcite have shown that the x - ray spectrum of the quiescent counterpart to sgr  052666 has a power - law index @xmath36 , similar to those seen in axps , but softer than those of sgrs .",
    "as sgr  052666 has been inactive for almost two decades , this suggests sgrs and axps are one and the same object , and may have even cycle back and forth between each flavor .",
    "another noteworthy question is what is the magnetar / radio pulsar connection ?",
    "recent observations of radio pulsars having apparent surface dipolar magnetic fields comparable @xcite , and in one very new case ( mclaughlin et al . ,",
    "private communication ) , surpassing those of some axps , leaves open the question of what physically distinguishes a magnetar from a rotation - powered pulsar of high magnetic field ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the sources classified as magnetars might have much higher fields , in the form of multipole moments . perhaps comparing the thermal x - ray emission from radio pulsars having a variety of magnetic fields may illuminate the situation .",
