    "the observational data of ia supernova(snia ) @xcite , large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite show that the universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion .",
    "it is believed that a dark energy with negative pressure can drive this accelerated expansion .",
    "the dark energy ( de ) problem attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade . up to now , many models such as @xmath7cdm , the models with a scalar field and modified gravity had been proposed @xcite.also in the last decade the other models base on quantum field theory such as holographic @xcite and agegraphic ( ade ) @xcite dark energy models are suggested .",
    "the latter is arisen from combining quantum mechanics with general relativity directly .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that up to now , a completely successful quantum theory of gravity is not available .",
    "there are two main problems in dealing with @xmath7cdm model which are fine - tuning and cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "the ade model , which is proposed by cai @xcite , is based on the line of quantum fluctuations of spacetime , the so - called krolyhzy relation @xmath8 , and the energy - time heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath9 .",
    "these relations enable one to obtain an energy density of the metric quantum fluctuations of minkowski spacetime as follows @xcite @xmath10throughout this paper , we use the plank unit ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 are plank s time , length and mass , respectively . in ade , this energy density is considered as density of dark energy component , @xmath13 , of spacetime . by considering a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , due to effect of curvature",
    ", one should introduce a numerical factor @xmath14 in ( [ ed ] ) @xcite .    by making a model that considering de , independent of the other mater fields , one can study the evolution of characteristics of dark energy of spacetime very well .",
    "the recent observational data from the abell cluster @xmath15 supports the interaction between dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "however , the strength of this interaction is not exactly identified @xcite . also , nowadays , many authors are interested to consider non - flat frw universe @xcite .",
    "the tendency of a closed universe is shown in a suite cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "besides of it , the measurements of the cubic correction to the luminosity - distance of supernova measurements reveal a closed universe @xcite . in accordance of",
    "all mentioned above , we prefer to consider a model including dark matter and dark energy for a non - flat frw universe .    the interacting new ade ( nade ) which is a new version of ade with a conformal time instead of a cosmic time in frw metric .",
    "the motivation of this new model is for that the original ade model can not explain the matter - dominated era @xcite .",
    "recently , the interacting nade model has been investigated and some cosmological quantities such as deceleration parameter @xmath4 , evolution behavior of fractional dark energy density @xmath16 , and equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath17 , are obtained @xcite .",
    "the next step beyond hubble parameter @xmath18 and @xmath19 , is to consider a new quantity contains @xmath20 .",
    "a pair quantities which have been introduced by sahni et al . and alam et al .",
    "@xcite , are called statefinder pair \\{r , s } , as@xmath21the statefinder pair is a geometrical diagnostic tool which is constructed directly from a spacetime metric .",
    "the importance of such pair is to distinguish of the cosmological evolution behaviors of dark energy models with the same values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the present time . at future by combining the data of supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) with statefinder diagnosis , we may choose the best model of dark energy .",
    "up to now , many authors have investigated statefinder trajectories for standard @xmath24cdm model and quintessence @xcite , interacting quintessence models @xcite , chaplygin gas , the holographic dark energy models @xcite , the holographic dark energy model in non - flat universe r16 , the phantom model @xcite , the tachyon @xcite , the ade model with and without interaction @xcite and the interacting nade model in flat universe @xcite .",
    "they had shown the statefinder diagnosis is a useful tool for discrimination between various dark energy models .",
    "in addition to the statefinder geometrical diagnostic , the another tool to distinguish between the different models of dark energy is @xmath25 analysis which is used extensively in the literature @xcite .    in this paper , in addition of cosmic behavior investigation , we study the statefinder trajectories and @xmath25 analysis for interacting nade model in a non - flat frw universe .",

    "fig.(1 ) shows the evolution of @xmath3 of interacting nade model in terms of scale factor . in fig.(1-a )",
    "we illustrate the evolution of @xmath3 for fixed model parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 , in open , flat and closed universe .",
    "all three cases give the phantom divide at the early time and mimic the cosmological constant at the late time . in figs.(1-b,1-c ) , the dependence of the evolution of @xmath3 on the model parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 are investigated . here",
    "we choose the closed universe with the present spatial curvature @xmath111 . in fig.(1-b ) , by fixing @xmath107 , we vary the parameter @xmath2 as 3 , 4 and 5 . in the case of @xmath110",

    "it can be seen that the phantom divide is archived for @xmath107 and @xmath115 and it can not be access for @xmath113 ( the nade model without interaction ) .",

    ", the deceleration parameter @xmath4 crosses the boundary @xmath122 from @xmath123 to @xmath124 .",

    "the standard @xmath7cdm model in non flat universe corresponds to the fixed point ( @xmath130,@xmath131 ) in the @xmath132 plane @xcite .",
    "one way to test the ability of a given dark energy model is the deviation value of the model from the fixed point ( @xmath130,@xmath133 ) in @xmath132 diagram .",
    "let us start with eqs.([wp_d],[state_s ] and [ state_r])which describe the evolution of statefinder parameters @xmath74 , @xmath78 and also @xmath134 .",

    "it should be noted that the evolution trajectories start form fixed point ( @xmath151 ) at the early time , as mentioned above .",
