    "one possible criterion is to test if the variance of the stochastic process is finite ( variable diffusion ) or infinite ( lvy ) .",

    "this phenomenon , referred to as `` clustering of volatility , '' suggests that lvy processes are unlikely to be the source of scalable non - gaussian distributions in financial markets .",
    "the theory we have presented is not merely a reformulation where an observed scalable probability density function @xmath2 is recast into a suitably chosen diffusion coefficient @xmath7 .",

    "the diffusion coefficient can be chosen to be a function of @xmath135 , and there is a correspondence between @xmath9 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 .    the fact that successive events are independent in lvy processes and only martingales in our variable diffusion processes implies that dynamics can be used to identify which model is more suitable to represent a given time series of stochastic events .",
    "we propose the use of the auto - correlation of @xmath156 s as such a test .",
    "previous studies of financial markets suggest that they consist of increments that are not independent , and hence suggest that independent lvy processes are unlikely to be the correct explanation for the observed non - gaussian probability density functions @xcite .",
    "the need for @xmath105-dependent diffusion coefficients implies that the stochastic dynamics is not invariant under translations in @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , for the examples given earlier , the origin is both the starting point of the walk as well as the location where @xmath7 is minimized . in financial markets",
    ", one does expect any sudden large fluctuation in the price of a stock to be followed by a period of high anxiety in the part of traders ; consequently the stock can be expected to trade at a significantly higher rate .",
    "this is equivalent to an increase in the diffusion rate .",
    "however , if the price of the stock settles at this new value , it is likely that the location of the minimum in @xmath7 will move towards it .",
