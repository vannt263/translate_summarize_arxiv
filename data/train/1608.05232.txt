    "nature of two - dimensional melting is one of the long - standing problems in condensed matter physics . despite a lot of publications in past forty years , the controversy about the microscopic nature of melting in two dimensions ( @xmath0 ) still lasts .",
    "in contrast to the three dimensional case , where melting occurs through the conventional first order transition , several microscopic scenarios were proposed for the microscopic description of @xmath0 melting .",
    "the reason of this difference is the drastic increase of fluctuations in @xmath0 in comparison with the @xmath1 case .",
    "landau , peierls and mermin @xcite showed that in two dimensions the long - ranged positional order can not exist because of the thermal fluctuations and transforms to the quasi - long - ranged one . on the other hand , the real long - ranged orientational order ( the order in directions of the bonds joining the particle with its nearest neighbors )",
    "does exist in this case .",
    "now the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young ( kthny ) theory of @xmath0 melting @xcite is the most widely accepted . in this theory",
    "it was proposed that @xmath0 solids melt through two continuous transitions , which are induced by the formation of the topological defects .",
    "for example , an elementary topological defect of the triangular lattice is a disclination .",
    "disclination in a triangular crystal lattice is defined as an isolated defect with five or seven nearest neighbours .",
    "a dislocation can be considered as a bound pair of 5 and 7-fold disclinations . in the framework of the kthny scenario ,",
    "the @xmath0 solid melts through dissociation of bound dislocation pairs . in this case",
    "the long - ranged orientational order transforms into quasi - long - ranged one , and quasi - long - ranged positional order becomes short - ranged .",
    "this new intermediate phase is called a hexatic phase . in turn",
    ", the hexatic phase transforms into an isotropic liquid phase with a short - ranged orientational and positional orders through unbinding of dislocations ( 5 and 7-fold bound pairs ) into free disclinations .",
    "it should be noted , that the kthny theory gives only limits of stability of the solid and hexatic phases and does not reject the possibility of the preempting first order liquid - solid transition with another melting mechanism .",
    "the kthny theory seems universal and applicable to all system .",
    "however , it contains two phenomenological parameters , the core energy of dislocation @xmath2 and frank module of hexatic phase @xmath3 , which do not have explicit expressions in terms of the interparticle potential .",
    "as it was shown later , with decreasing @xmath2 melting can occur through a single first - order transition as a result of , for example , the formation of grain boundaries @xcite or `` explosion '' of 5 - 7 - 5 - 7 quartets ( bound dislocation pairs ) into free disclinations @xcite .",
    "recently the ktnhy scenario was unambiguously experimentally confirmed for superparamagnetic colloidal particles interacting via long - range dipolar interaction @xcite . in these experiments the particles",
    "are absorbed at liquid - air interface , which restricts the out - of - plane motion .",
    "on the other hand , in very popular experimental systems of colloidal particles confined between two glass plates @xcite the melting transition consistent with the kthny scenario was found @xcite . at the same time , a first order liquid - solid @xcite and even a first - order liquid - hexatic and a first - order hexatic - solid phase transitions @xcite are also possible .",
    "one can conclude from these results that the melting mechanism is not universal and depends on the interparticle interactions .",
    "however , controversies still exist even for the same systems , like , for example , for hard spheres @xcite .    recently , another melting scenario was proposed @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the kthny theory , it was argued that in the basic hard disk model the hexatic phase does exists , and the system melts through a continuous solid - hexatic transition but a first - order hexatic - liquid transition @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that there is a first - order transition between the stable hexatic phase and isotropic liquid in @xmath0 yukawa system . in their work @xcite kapfer and krauth",
    "have considered the behavior of soft disk system with the potential of the form @xmath4 .",
    "they have shown that the system melts in accordance with the kthny theory for @xmath5 , while for @xmath6 the two - stage melting transition takes place with the continuous solid - hexatic transition and the first - order hexatic - liquid one .",
    "experimental confirmation of this scenario was found in the system of colloidal particles on water - decane interface @xcite .",
    "it should be also noted the recent publication @xcite , where for the herzian disks model it was shown that at low densities there is a discontinuous liquid - hexatic transition while at higher densities the system melts through the continuous kosterlitz - thouless transition .    in real experiments ,",
    "two - dimensional confinement is typically realized in slit pores of different nature or by adsorption on solid substrates . in both cases",
    "the frozen - in ( quenched ) disorder due to some roughness or intrinsic defects can appear .",
    "quenched disorder can change the melting scenario in @xmath0 .",
    "a disordered substrate can have the similar destructive effect on the crystalline order as temperature and can lead to the melting even at zero temperature @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown , that the kthny melting scenario persists in the presence of weak disorder .",
    "as it is intuitively clear , the temperature of the hexatic - isotropic liquid transition @xmath7 is almost unaffected by disorder , while the melting temperature @xmath8 drastically decreases with increasing disorder @xcite . as a result",
    ", the stability range of the hexatic phase widens .",
    "these predictions have been confirmed in experiment and simulations of the system of superparamagnetic colloidal particles @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the particles form a monolayer on the bottom of a cylindrical glass cell of @xmath9 diameter due to gravity .",
    "quenched disorder occurs due to pinning of a small amount of particles to the glass substrate due to van der waals interactions and chemical reactions . in our simulations we tried to choose the simulation method in qualitative accordance with this experimental setup .    in this paper , we present a detailed computer simulation study of @xmath0 phase diagram of the previously introduced core softened potential system @xcite in the presence of the quenched disorder for different values of the width of the repulsive shoulder .",
    "various forms of the core - softened potentials are widely used for the qualitative description of the water - like anomalous behavior , including density , structural and diffusion anomalies , liquid - liquid phase transitions , glass transitions , melting maxima @xcite . in our previous publications the preliminary result on the phase diagram of the system were reported @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the random pinning widens the range of the hexatic phase and transforms the first - order melting at high densities into two transitions - first - order liquid - hexatic and continuous kosterlitz - thouless - like solid - hexatic transitions @xcite . here",
    "we present the corrected version of the phase diagram for the system with the larger repulsive shoulder , obtained with the use of additional criteria including the calculation of the diffusion coefficient of the hexatic phase .",
    "we also study the system with small repulsive shoulder .",
    "it is shown , that in this case the behavior of the system is similar to the soft disks one @xcite .",
    "the presence of the random pinning leads to drastic increase of the width of the hexatic phase , but does not change the melting scenario .",
