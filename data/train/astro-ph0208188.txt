    "in an epoch of extraordinary discoveries on the high - z universe , we still have gaps in our understanding of stellar evolution , which is in fact essential for the correct interpretation of the light of distant galaxies .",
    "galactic star clusters have traditionally provided a major way to study stellar evolution",
    ". however , our galaxy only contains stars in age and chemical composition domains which reflect its particular history , and these are the domains which have been relatively well explored .",
    "extrapolation outside the limits of the well explored age and metallicity range is not always safe .",
    "for instance , it has become increasingly apparent in recent years that metal content can affect stellar evolution in unexpected ways .",
    "the uv upturn in elliptical galaxies is a case in point .",
    "studies of very metal rich stellar systems revealed that , contrary to simple expectations , old metal rich stellar populations do not simply become redder in all wavebands as they evolve , but rather produce a population of uv bright stars ( greggio & renzini , 1990 ; horch , demarque & pinsonneault , 1992 ; fagotto et al . 1994 ; yi , demarque & oemler 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "understanding the evolution of extremely metal - poor and metal - free ( population iii ) stars will similarly be essential for the interpretation of primordial , high - z stellar populations .    in intermediate - age stellar populations , the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and the luminosity function",
    "are affected by convective core overshoot . while there is not a general agreement on the efficiency of this process , and",
    "its extent is not well established , most researchers agree that this parameter affects significantly the morphology of the cmd of these clusters and naturally the determination of their ages as well ( e.g. rosvick & vandenberg 1998 ; keller , da costa & bessell 2001 ; meynet , mermilliod & maeder 1993 ; carraro et al .",
    "1993 ; demarque , sarajedini & guo 1994 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is thus also a problem for the spectral dating of distant stellar systems from their integrated light ( heap et al .",
    "1998 ; yi et al .",
    "in addition , deep cmds of intermediate - age clusters are essential to help disentangle the relative importance of other poorly determined parameters , such as mass loss during red giant branch ( rgb ) evolution , internal rotation ( important for the more massive objects ) , and helium content .",
    "in particular , the adopted value of the parameter @xmath2 of helium enrichment significantly affects the mass luminosity relation of stellar models , and consequently their evolutionary lifetimes .",
    "the papers in this series deal mainly with the problem of convective core overshoot in intermediate - age stellar populations , and therefore we will briefly review some of the recent work in the subject .",
    "early observational arguments in favor of convective core overshoot come from clusters like pleiades ( maeder & mermilliod 1981 ; mazzei & pigatto 1989 ) and from other galactic clusters , as discussed in great detail by maeder & mermilliod ( 1981 ) and mermilliod & maeder ( 1986 ) .",
    "barbaro & pigatto ( 1984 ) and chiosi & pigatto ( 1986 ) argued for overshoot in stars with masses in the range @xmath3 by pointing out that the base of the rgb is not well populated in clusters with age 1  2 gyr ( whereas it is in older clusters ) , as if degenerate he - ignition and he - flash were avoided for this mass range , in contrast with classical models .",
    "more recent studies include those of aparicio et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , carraro et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , meynet et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; rosvick & vandenberg ( 1998 ) ; demarque et al . ( 1994 ) ; dinescu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; kozhurina - platais et al .",
    "( 1997 ) which deal with galactic open clusters of ages 1.0 to 6.0 gyr .",
    "all conclude that a certain amount of convective core overshoot is preferred to reproduce the cmds .",
    "being galactic , all these clusters have metallicity close to solar , and therefore do not allow the possibility of testing the dependence of convective core overshoot on metallicity .    the magellanic clouds ( mc ) offer an unusual opportunity to test stellar evolution since populous clusters of a wide variety of ages and chemical compositions can be observed and compared at effectively the same distance . in particular ,",
    "they contain young and intermediate - age metal - poor stellar populations that are absent in the galaxy .",
    "a number of young mc clusters ( age @xmath4 500 myr ) have been used by lattanzio et al ( 1991 ) , vallenari et al .",

    "( 1999 ) and barmina et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to constrain evolutionary models of young stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that these different studies do not always agree on the preferred amount of convective core overshoot to best reproduce the observed cmds . in particular",
    "there is a long lasting debate about the young lmc cluster ngc 1866 , where turnoff stars have about @xmath5 : chiosi et al .",
    "( 1989a , b ) and brocato & castellani ( 1988 ) , lattanzio et al .",

    "( 1999 ) and barmina et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , are pairs of papers presenting systematically opposite conclusions ( for or against overshooting ) . to briefly summarize only the most recent ones , testa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained deep photometry ( @xmath6 ) of a wide region of this cluster , and concluded that the best fit to both the integrated luminosity function and the magnitude of the horizontal branch is achieved by classical models , without overshooting , provided that a 30@xmath7 fraction of binaries is allowed .",
    "however , a new analysis of the same data with a more accurate completeness correction and normalization , by barmina et al . ( 2002 ) , showed that models with overshoot give a better fit to both the overall morphology of the cmd and to the integrated luminosity function of main sequence stars , reproducing the correct ratio of main sequence to post - main sequence stars .",
    "thanks to the brightness of the stars in the young mc clusters , the above mentioned observations were feasible using medium size telescopes . instead , our aim is to explore the less studied regime of intermediate - age , low metallicity clusters , which turnoff is by definition fainter , and therefore only 8-meter size telescopes under excellent seeing conditions , or the hst , can give the necessary high quality photometry .",
    "our intention is also to independently analyze the data with two of the most recent sets of stellar evolutionary models widely in use , namely , those of padova ( girardi et al . 2000 ) and yonsei - yale ( yi et al .",
    "2001 , @xmath8 thereafter ) .    in this paper ,",

    "is discussed in sec .",
    "4 . in sec . 5",
    ", we briefly discuss the main differences between the stellar evolution models of girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and yi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in sec . 6 , a preliminary comparison of the cluster cmds with these stellar evolutionary models",
    "is performed . in two forthcoming papers that follow in this same issue ,",
    "these data are independently analyzed in detail with both the @xmath8 ( woo et al .",
    "2002 ) and padova ( bertelli et al . 2002 ) models , in such a way that some feedback on the stellar evolution models used can be provided .",
    "the goal of this project was to obtain accurate @xmath9 photometry down to about 4 magnitudes below the main sequence turnoff of a number of intermediate - age mc clusters , in order to construct cmds and luminosity functions to be used as test for stellar evolutionary models computed independently by members of the yale group ( demarque , yi , woo)and the padova group ( bertelli , chiosi , girardi , nasi ) .",
    "we originally proposed to observe eight clusters , in pairs of 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 gyr each ( according to the ages quoted in the literature ) to be able to check the extent of the fluctuations in the properties of clusters ( e.g. luminosity function ) of the same age .",
    "the candidates were selected according to : _ a ) _ their age ( from geisler et al .",
    "1997 ; sarajedini 1998 ; mighell , sarajedini & french 1998 ) , _ b ) _ their position in the galaxy , trying to avoid areas densely populated by field stars , and _",
    "c ) _ their richness .",
    "the original list of clusters included ngc  2209 and ngc  2249 ( @xmath10 1 gyr old ) , ngc  1651 and ngc  2162 ( @xmath10 2 gyr old ) , ngc  2173 and sl  556 ( @xmath10 3 gyr old ) and ngc  2155 and kron  3 ( @xmath10 5 gyr old ) .",
    "the first four younger clusters were to be observed with ntt down to a limiting magnitude of v=23.5 and 24.5 , while the rest were proposed for fors1@vlt , with the goal of reaching limiting magnitudes v=25.5 ( for ngc  2173 and sl  556 ) , v=26.0 for ngc  2155 and v=26.3 for kron  3 . due to the high resolution needed to obtain accurate photometry in such rich and distant clusters",
    ", we requested service mode observations imposing a seeing constraint of fwhm @xmath40.6 . in the end , due to observational problems and restrictions , no observations with ntt were performed for this program , while 3 out of the 4 clusters to be observed with vlt were indeed observed , namely , ngc  2155 , ngc  2173 and sl  556 .    in what follows",
    "we summarize the results of previous studies of these clusters , concentrating in particular on the metallicity determinations , being this an important input parameter for our analysis .",
    "the distance modulus of the lmc , being the first step of the distance scale ladders , has been the subject of an intense debate in recent years and trying to summarize it goes beyond the scope of this paper : the generally accepted value of @xmath11 ( benedict et al .",
    "2002 ) has been adopted , allowing a variation of @xmath12 in the isochrone fit , which can be justified by volume effect of the lmc on the distance modulus of each cluster .",
    "small variation of the reddening around @xmath13 along the different lines of sight of the three clusters , will be allowed in our analysis as well .",
    "available determinations of the metallicity of these clusters are very inhomogeneous , first of all because of the different methods applied , and second because some of them lead to the determination of the global metallicity , [ m / h]=@xmath14 ( e.g. when using isochrone fitting ) , while some others give a measure of the iron abundance , [ fe / h]=@xmath15 ( e.g. spectroscopic or photometric methods calibrated against [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "obviously the two quantities are different if the alpha - element ratio of the cluster stars is different from solar , as it is for galactic globular clusters . since there currently is no high dispersion spectral analysis of the mc clusters from which one could infer their alpha - element enhancement , in what follows we will keep the distinction among the two chemical abundances , as measured by the various authors , reminding the reader that _ if _ the alpha - element enhancement of these lmc clusters were the same as that of galactic globular clusters ( i.e. , [ @xmath16/fe]@xmath17 0.3 , carney 1996 ) then their global metal abundance [ m / h ] can be assumed to be @xmath18 dex higher than the iron content",

    "no color terms were considered necessary on the photometric transformation , and zero - points had typical errors of @xmath27 0.004 .",
    "aperture corrections for the cluster stars were obtained from a list of @xmath10 70 relatively isolated , bright stars in each cluster , with standard errors of @xmath28 mag .",

    "to this end , it is crucial to correct the observed counts for completeness .",
    "completeness corrections were determined by means of artificial - star experiments .",
    "a total of about 30,000 stars were added to the original frames , with magnitudes and colors consistent with the main branches of the cluster and field cmd . in order to avoid overcrowding , while optimizing the cpu time , the artificial stars were added along the corners of an hexagonal grid , as explained in zoccali et al . ( 2000 ) , in five independent experiments . as usual , photometry of the artificial frames",
    "was performed in a way identical to that of the original ones .",

    "all the stars measured with good precision in the whole fors1 frames are plotted here : therefore the cmds include both cluster and field stars . in order to obtain a cleaner cluster cmd , we proceeded in the following way .    for each cluster ,",
    "an annulus around the center was selected with the criterion of being large enough to contain most cluster stars , but small enough to minimize the background contribution .",
    "the cmd for the stars in this annulus are shown in the upper left panel ( panel _ a _ ) of figs .",
    "[ n2173 ] to [ n2155 ] , together with the inner and outer radii of the selected annuli .",
    "the small circular region containing the very center of the cluster was excluded because stars in these areas were too crowded , and therefore their photometry was rather poor .",
    "a cmd typical of lmc field stars was extracted from a second region , outside a given radius around the cluster center , selected with the criterion of containing a number of stars large enough to insure good statistics , but far enough from the cluster not to contain a significant fraction of cluster stars .",
    "the cmds extracted from these `` field '' regions are shown in the upper right panels ( _ b _ ) of figs .",
    "[ n2173 ] to [ n2155 ] , together with the inner boundary of the region .",
    "the outer boundary is set by the edges of the frame .",
    "for each star in the field cmd ( panel _ b _ ) we picked up the _ closest _ ( see below ) star in the cluster cmd ( panel _ a _ ) , and decided whether to subtract it or not according to a factor given by the ratio of the areas of the two regions , multiplied by the ratio of the completeness factors for the two regions ( being less crowded , the field cmd is more complete than the cluster one ) .",
    "the _ distance _ , @xmath31 , from the field star to each cluster star on the cmd was actually computed by enhancing the difference in color by a factor of 7 with respect to the difference in magnitude , i.e. : @xmath32 ^ 2 + \\delta v^2}.\\ ] ] which defines an ellipse with major axis along the magnitudes and minor axis along the colors .",
    "the reason for this is that given a certain star in the field cmd , its `` twin '' in the cluster cmd has a color that is better constrained than the magnitude , because any small difference in either distance , reddening , or mass between the two would result in a difference in magnitude larger than that in color .",
    "if there were no stars closer than a maximum distance of @xmath33 magnitudes then no star was subtracted from the cluster cmd , and the field star was flagged as unsubtracted . both the enhancement factor and the maximum distance are somewhat arbitrary , and they were chosen after various experiments , according to two criteria : _",
    "i. _ the cmd of the subtracted stars ( panel _ d _ ) should be as similar as possible to that of the field stars ( panel _ b _ ) and _ ii . _",
    "the number of field stars flagged as unsubtracted should be as small as possible .    the result of this procedure ( i.e. , the cmd in panel _",
    "c _ ) is indeed satisfactory , since in general only the cmd of a single intermediate - age population is present in this plot .",
    "some younger main sequence stars are still present in the decontaminated cmd of ngc  2155 , due to the fact that , being the young lmc population intrinsically clumpy ( like any young stellar population in galaxies ) , the assumption we make here , that the stars we measure just outside the cluster boundary are representative of a population identical to that contaminating the cluster cmd , is true only as a first approximation .",
    "the goal of this project is to compare the observed and theoretical cmd of intermediate - age , metal - poor clusters , in order to constrain some of the still uncertain parameters used in stellar evolutionary models . in the following two papers of this series",
    ", the data presented here will be independently analyzed by members of the yale and the padova stellar evolution groups , with the aim of calibrating both sets of models , and also to better identify the effects of different assumptions on the simulated cmds . in view of this , here we present a comparison between the sets of isochrones published by the two groups , in the range of ages and metallicity spanned by the observed clusters , namely 1@xmath343 gyr and z=0.004@xmath340.008 . we consider this as a `` first - order '' comparison because we are considering only the published models , without any fine tuning of the input parameters , that will be performed in the following two papers . because the two grids of models and isochrones were derived independently , a comparison between them can provide a measure of the uncertainties in isochrone fitting , as well as the robustness of the ages derived for lmc star clusters .",

    "( 1987 ) , but those transformed with the lejeune et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tables have been selected as those better reproducing the observed cmds .",
    "the effects of the different color transformations are apparent in the [ @xmath48 plane shown in the rigth panel .",
    "the padova isochrones ( girardi et al . 2000 ) are slightly redder than the y@xmath38 ones along the unevolved main sequence and in the rgb , an effect that must be attributed to the color transformation alone since these parts of the isochrones match closely in the theoretical plane .",
    "the differences in the sub giant branch ( sgb ) region , mainly consisting in the y@xmath38 isochrones being brighter , are a combination of the differences in luminosity already noted in the theoretical plane , and the effects of the color transformation . in any case , the uncertainty in color is within the errors of the hipparcos subdwarf data .",
    "figure  [ compaclus ] displays a comparison among the fiducial lines of the three clusters .",
    "the cluster loci have been superimposed with no correction for possible differences in reddening or distance modulus .",
    "note that , due to the presence of binary stars ( see discussion in paper ii ) , drawing a fiducial sequence in the sgb region just above the main sequence turnoff is not straightforward , especially for sl  556 .",
    "nevertheless , it is still evident from figure  [ compaclus ] that the clusters show a trend in the @xmath0 magnitude of the main sequence turnoff , and a ( opposite ) trend in the magnitude of the red - clump .",
    "the main sequence trend is clearly one in age , while the variation of the red - clump luminosity is consistent with the prediction by girardi & salaris ( 2001 ) about the luminosity evolution of the red - clump in the age interval 1 - 3 gyr .",
    "figure  [ n2173_iso ] shows the comparison between the cmd of ngc  2173 and the y@xmath38 ( left ) and padova ( right ) theoretical isochrones .",
    "the same apparent distance modulus @xmath49 and metallicity z=0.004 , have been used in both cases , while due to the differences in the color transformations shown in fig .",
    "[ compayalepado ] , slightly different reddenings and ages are required for a good match with the two models .",
    "both models reproduce quite well the main sequence , turnoff and sgb region , while they both fail to reproduce the color location of the rgb . a small change in slope",
    "would be needed to bring the theoretical y@xmath38 rgb on top of the observed one , while a substantially different slope would be required to bring the padova model into agreement with the data . in both cases",
    "a higher metallicity would improve the rgb fit , while the fit to the rest of the cmd remains similarly good .",
    "we adopt z=0.004 for consistency with the two following papers in this series . the magnitude of the red - clump of the padova models matches very well the observed one , while the color is slightly too blue , as all the agb .",
    "our crude estimate of the cluster age is therefore @xmath17 1.5 gyr .",
    "figure  [ sl556_iso ] shows the comparison between the cmd of sl  556 and the theoretical isochrones from y@xmath38 ( left ) and padova ( right ) .",
    "a distance modulus of @xmath11 and a metallicity of z=0.004 has been adopted in both cases , while slightly different reddening and age were used for the two models .",
    "the shape of the sgb region of this cluster is rather peculiar , and apparently quite different from theoretical predictions .",
    "as it will be shown in the next papers of this series , this shape can be explained by the presence of a fraction of binaries , also evident from the fact that there seems to be a second sequence , on the right , and parallel , to the cluster main sequence . excluding this sgb region just above the turnoff , both models reproduce well the observed cmd .",
    "the y@xmath38 models also predict a correct rgb slope all the way up to the tip , while the padova ones are steeper than the observed rgb , for magnitudes brighter than the red - clump .",
    "also in this case , the fit would be improved by adopting a higher metallicity , but then also a negative reddening would be required .",
    "figure  [ n2155_iso ] shows the cmd of ngc  2155 compared with y@xmath38 ( left ) and padova theoretical isochrones ( right ) .",
    "also for this cluster the same apparent distance modulus @xmath11 and metallicity z=0.004 , have been used in both cases , while slightly different reddenings and ages were required to achieve a good fit with the two models .",
    "two isochrones are shown in the left panel , with or without core overshooting , the difference being only evident in the shape of the turnoff and sgb ; some intermediate value of overshooting seems to be needed for a better fit of the observed points ( see discussion in paper ii ) .",
    "the rgb is well reproduced by the @xmath8 model all the way up to the tip , while the padova one , due to the use of different transformations , starts to deviate from the observed points towards brighter magnitudes .",
    "a higher metallicity would improve the fit of the rgb slope , but then the other sequences would be too red in the model .",
    "the red - clump , only available in the padova isochrones , perfectly matches the observed one , while the theoretical agb is of course too blue , as the upper rgb . using these models ,",
    "our best estimate of the cluster age in this preliminary analysis is therefore between 2.5 and 3 gyr .",
    "this preliminary investigation on three intermediate age lmc clusters , namely ngc 2173 , sl 556 and ngc 2155 is the starting point for a very detailed analysis aiming at a test on input physics for stellar models . in principle",
    "there is the opportunity to check the efficiency of convective core overshoot for star masses between 1.1 and 1.5 @xmath50 by comparison of these cmds with synthetic cmds and isochrones .",
    "the isochrone fitting to the cmds of the clusters gives some information on their age and metallicity , but we must take into account that there are also uncertainties in the lmc distance modulus and interstellar reddening . only a more refined analysis , considering also the star distribution in several regions of the cmd ,",
    "will give reliable results .",
    "in the following two papers of this series , the synthetic cmd technique will be used independently by members of the padova and yale groups to determine the cluster characteristics , taking into account the uncertainties in the observations and in stellar evolutionary models , and to give some feed - back into the stellar evolutionary models themselves .",
    "our data was collected as part of an eso service mode run .",
