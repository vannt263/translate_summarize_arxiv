    "from a theoretical point of view , it is well known that the coulomb interaction leads to the luttinger liquid ( ll ) behavior of one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems .",
    "the ll is mostly characterized by the spin - charge separation in the elementary excitation spectrum .",
    "@xcite however , experimental results concerning inelastic light scattering due to both charge - density ( plasmon ) and particle - hole ( single - particle ) excitations in 1d electron systems based on semiconductor quantum wires ( sqws ) can be interpreted within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) in the framework of the fermi liquid ( fl ) theory .",
    "@xcite among other issues , the fermi edge singularity @xcite and the band gap renormalization @xcite in these systems can also be successfully explained within the rpa . as a matter of fact",
    ", the resonant inelastic light - scattering experiments in sqws have been analyzed using both the fl and ll theory .",
    "@xcite recently , a new kind of tunneling spectroscopy in coupled parallel quantum wires in gaas - based semiconductors was able to check out the luttinger liquid behavior of the electrons in extremely clean systems at very low temperatures .",
    "@xcite differences between the luttinger and fermi liquid behavior turned out to be noticeable in the one - electron spectrum .",
    "so far , no definitive evidence for ll versus fl behavior has been obtained .",
    "it is still a puzzle in clarifying the conditions under which the 1d electron system embedded in sqw behaves as a ll .",
    "there have been theoretical suggestions that mechanisms induced by impurity scattering , thermal fluctuations as well as intersubband scattering can likely suppress the ll behavior .",
    "@xcite effects of the intersubband ( or interwire ) excitations are believed to disable the ll behavior , provided the system looses its strict one - dimensional character .",
    "moreover , electron intra- and intersubband relaxations through slightly impurity scattering channels could restore the fl behavior .",
    "on the other hand , localized impurity ( or defect ) induced effects in a 1d metallic systems in quantum wires have been extensively studied @xcite within both the fl and ll theories .",
    "these impurity effects turn out to be related to critical phenomena in the strongly correlated regime and to the x - ray absorption spectrum , where a optical created valence hole is regarded as an impurity .    in this work",
    "we are interested in studying the impurity induced optical properties in semiconductor quantum wires which can be helpful in understanding the 1d properties of the electron systems .",
    "we focus on the spectral function of a localized valence hole ( or an spinless impurity ) in a two - component coupled double quantum wires at finite temperatures .",
    "the considered interaction is of a localized state with a continuum described by a coupled double 1d system with two subbands ( or components ) filled with electrons .",
    "two parallel wires in the @xmath0-direction , with zero thickness in the @xmath1-direction , compose the system . in the @xmath2-direction , the two wires are of 300   and 200   widths , respectively , separated by a 30-algaas barrier of 300 mev height .",
    "we assume zero thickness in the @xmath1-direction since the confinement in this direction is much stronger than that in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the energy gap between the first and the second subbands is @xmath3 @xmath4 5.36 mev .",
    "we consider the impurity localized at the center of the barrier .",
    "such a system is also similar to a type - ii quantum wire heterostructures , where valence holes are localized between two parallel 1d electron gases .",
    "our theoretical result indicates that the interwire tunneling induced many - body effects in coupled asymmetric quantum wire systems lead to a non - monotonic impurity spectral function .",
    "a pronounced extra peak appears in the impurity spectral function up to 20 k.    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii we provide our numerical results and discussions ; we conclude in sec .",
    "iv with a summary .",
    "the anisotropy in the direction perpendicular to the wires leads to a very weak tunneling , but it is sensitive enough to produce important effects on both the electron - electron ( e - e ) @xmath5 and the electron - impurity ( e - i ) @xmath6 coulomb interactions . the asymmetry leads to nonzero off - diagonal e - e interaction matrix elements of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite these elements represent e - e scattering in which only one of the electrons experiences interwire ( or intersubband ) transition . in the symmetric situation ( two identical wires ) , however , these off - diagonal matrix elements vanish because the wavefunctions of the ground and the first excited states are symmetrical and anti - symmetrical , respectively , in the confinement direction .    on the other hand , the e - i interaction matrix element related to the interwire transitions",
    "is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the static dielectric constant , @xmath9 the electron charge , @xmath10 the zeroth - order modified bessel function of the second order , and @xmath11 the electron wavefunction in the wire ( or subband ) @xmath12 .",
    "the derivation of this potential is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where its quasi - two - dimensional counterpart was calculated .",
    "the bessel function @xmath10 results from the integral in the @xmath0-direction , which involves the external e - i coulomb potential @xmath13 and the plane wave describing free electrons in that direction .",
    "it depends obviously on the impurity position @xmath14 , which has been chosen here as the origin of the coordinates .",
    "the component @xmath15 represents interwire ( intersubband ) transitions suffered by the electron as it interacts with the localized impurity .",
    "this interaction induces anisotropy ( or tunneling ) effects on the full impurity spectral function that we investigate in this work .",
    "we mention that , for two identical wires , @xmath16 due to the fact that the @xmath17 and @xmath18 are symmetrical and anti - symmetrical functions of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we model the system by an anderson impurity localized below the continuum of the two subbands ( @xmath19 ) in the coupled quantum wires filled with electrons .",
    "this approach has been used before in studying optical holes in doped two - dimensional systems at zero temperature.@xcite we point out that the hamiltonian presenting the interaction between the impurity and the two - component 1d electron gas can be transformed into a problem of a localized level with energy @xmath20 and a two - component non - interacting bosons ( electron - hole pairs ) .",
