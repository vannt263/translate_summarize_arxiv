    "during the last decades , highly charged ions have become an object of interest in a wide range of physics .",
    "well - developed theoretical models allow for highly accurate predictions , which , together with modern experimental techniques , enable the benchmark of atomic properties , tests of quantum electrodynamics in strong electric and magnetic fields  @xcite , the determination  @xcite and the search for possible variations  @xcite of the fundamental constants . in astrophysical research , atomic data of highly charged ions , e.g. , transition energies and probabilities , oscillator strengths , collisional and recombination cross sections , together with astrophysically measured spectra , allow one to determine the temperature , density , velocity , and element composition of various distant objects such as stars , x - ray binaries , black hole accretion discs , or active galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission lines of highly charged fe ions are among the brightest in astrophysical spectra  @xcite .",
    "several observations were performed with the space laboratories chandra and xmm - newton ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "particular interest has been focused on two strong @xmath2 e1 transitions in fe@xmath0 , customarily denoted as 3c and 3d , at 826 and 812  ev , respectively . for both lines",
    "the initial state is spherically symmetric , with a total angular momentum @xmath3 , and excited states have the same symmetry , @xmath4 .",
    "the line - strength ratio of those two lines was observed to disagree with theoretical predictions  @xcite . in an astrophysical setting , this disagreement was considered for a long time to originate from plasma effects and from the co - existence of different charge states of fe ions ; and in laboratory measurements , the unavoidable electron - impact excitation of the ions was considered a possible cause of the discrepancy . to exclude those effects , a laser spectroscopic experiment in the x - ray regime",
    "@xcite was recently carried out at an x - ray free - electron - laser ( xfel ) facility @xcite . as a result of this experiment ,",
    "a disagreement between all state - of - the - art theoretical predictions ( ratio of the 3c and 3d oscillator strength around 3.5 and above ) and an experimental line - strength ratio of 2.61(23 ) was stated  @xcite , which could be explained either with incorrect or insufficient knowledge of many - body atomic - structure theory , or with the presence of additional unknown effects .    in a recent letter @xcite , motivated by the above discrepancy , we reported on a possible mechanism to reduce the current disagreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results @xcite .",
    "similar results were later found by another theoretical study @xcite . here , we present a more complete theory of x - ray - ion interactions by calculating higher - order electron - correlation and quantum - electrodynamic ( qed ) corrections , along with nonlinear dynamical effects contributing to the 3c/3d line - strength ratio .",
    "we also present calculations on the coherent and incoherent part of the resonance fluorescence spectrum , whereby a method for checking the limitations of the applicability of the weak - field atomic theory is proposed .",
    "finally , we analyze the presence of autoionizing fe@xmath1 ions in the trap and show that a wide xfel intensity range should be considered .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in subsection [ higher - order correlation correction to the oscillator strengths ] we discuss the many - body atomic - structure calculations for the energies and einstein coefficients of the transitions under consideration including higher - order contributions .",
    "screened qed corrections to the transition energies are presented in subsection [ screened quantum electrodynamic corrections to the transition energies ] . in section [ strong - field effects ]",
    "we present a theoretical model for nonlinear dynamical effects ( [ modeling of ion  x - ray interaction ] , [ line - strength - ratio calculation ] ) , results of our simulations compared with current experimental data @xcite ( [ results and comparison with experimental line - strength ratios ] ) , and possible additionally contributing effects ( [ influence of the atomic calculations uncertainty ] , [ influence of fe15 + lines ] ) .",
    "as a first step towards resolving the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental results , atomic - structure parameters , such as transition energies and einstein coefficients , need to be refined . the calculation of the transition energies and einstein coefficients with the configuration - interaction dirac - fock - sturm ( ci - dfs ) method is considered in subsection [ higher - order correlation correction to the oscillator strengths ] .",
    "additionally , qed corrections to the transition energies are taken into account in an _ ab initio _ manner in subsection  [ screened quantum electrodynamic corrections to the transition energies ] .      in our calculations ,",
    "the ci - dfs method  @xcite was used for atomic - structure - theory calculations of the transition energies and dipole - transition rates in a large - scale setting . in the breit approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the relativistic @xmath5-electron system is given as the sum of the single - particle dirac hamiltonians @xmath6 and the interelectronic - interaction operator @xmath7 , which , with the usual notations  @xcite , can be written as @xmath8.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the numerical solution of the dirac - fock equation gives one - electron radial wave functions for the occupied orbitals , while solutions of the generalized dirac - fock - sturm equation are used as virtual orbitals with positive and negative energies .",
    "configuration state functions are built from @xmath9-coupled slater determinants with such one - electron wave functions .",
    "the total many - electron wave function @xmath10 with a total angular momentum @xmath11 is given as a linear combination of a large number @xmath12 of configuration state functions @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "the einstein coefficients @xmath15 and oscillator strengths @xmath16 are calculated with such many - electron wave functions representing the @xmath17 ground @xmath18 and @xmath19 excited @xmath20 states of the ion  @xcite : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand for the speed of light , the elementary charge , and the electron mass , respectively , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for the vector of dirac alpha matrices and the photon polarization unit vector .",
    "the summation goes over the magnetic quantum numbers of the initial state @xmath27 and final state @xmath28 , over the polarization @xmath29 of the emitted photon , and the integration goes over the direction @xmath30 of the emitted photon .",
    "the line strength is given as the integrated peak area of the resonance fluorescence cross section  @xcite : @xmath31 thus for low driving - field intensities the oscillator strength is proportional to the line strength .",
    ".transitions of fe@xmath0 , with their notations , energies , and spontaneous - decay rates @xmath32 calculated with the ci - dfs method . [ cols=\"<,<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the parameters of fe@xmath1 transitions are close to the parameters of fe@xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the saturation intensities @xmath33 are on the same order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath34  w/@xmath35 , and a similar sensitivity of the line - strength ratio to the interaction parameters is expected . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe15 ] the c / b line - strength ratio as a function of intensity is presented . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe15_16 ] spectra of both ions are displayed for an intensity of @xmath36 w/@xmath35 .    as apparent from figs .",
    "[ fig : function ] , [ fig : avpulse ] and [ fig : fe15 ] , both spectra are sensitive to the intensity , though the sensitivity of the fe@xmath1 spectrum is lower . in the wide range @xmath37",
    "w/@xmath35 the c / b ratio changes by only 20% and , within the experimental error bars , it can be regarded as constant , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , see supplementary figure s3 therein .",
    "therefore , an analogously wide range of intensities in the case of fe@xmath0 can not be excluded .",
    "in summary , we conclude that dynamical processes can modify the x - ray fluorescence spectra of highly charged fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath0 ions when driven with strong and short x - ray free - electron - laser pulses .",
    "oscillator strengths were calculated with a large - scale configuration - interaction dirac - fock - sturm method including single , double and triple excitations , confirming previous theoretical calculations and their discrepancy with the experiment .",
    "qed corrections to transition energies were estimated with an effective screening potential and found to be negligible . a strong dependence of the observed 3c/3d ratio on experimental parameters , such as xfel pulse intensity , duration and bandwidth was stated .",
    "by decreasing atomic calculations results of the @xmath38 ratio by 5% , we decrease the minimal intensity needed to reach the experimental measured value by 20% .",
    "we also find that the line - strength ratio of the c and b lines in fe@xmath1 is much less sensitive to the xfel intensities . as a result ,",
    "a wide interval of the intensities may be considered as possible for fe@xmath0 as well .",
    "furthermore , we propose that comparing the energy emitted in the forward direction and in any other direction can give a hint for the limitations in the applicability of the weak - field atomic theory .    concluding , we would like to stress that an accurate control of the pulse parameters such as intensity , duration and bandwidth is required for a proper analysis of the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , dynamical effects may be relevant for both laboratory measurements and for astrophysical observations with naturally incoherent x - ray sources .",
    "approaching the saturation intensity , the weak - field atomic theory employed so far is shown not to be applicable anymore , which is equally valid for corresponding astrophysical scenarios .",
    "for instance , in the accretion disk of stellar - mass black holes in x - ray binaries  @xcite , the eddington luminosity of @xmath39  w/@xmath40 at a distance close to the innermost stable orbit of three schwarzschild radii leads to an intensity of approximately @xmath41  w/@xmath40 for a line at 1 kev with a 1-ev width , requiring the inclusion of the previously neglected nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we acknowledge helpful advice and computer codes from ilya i. tupitsyn and insightful conversations with sven bernitt , jos r. crespo lpez - urrutia , alberto benedetti and jrg evers .",

    "we denote with @xmath64 the three standard spherical components of the first - order irreducible tensor operator @xmath63 .",
