    "following efron s seminal paper  @xcite on the i.i.d .",
    "bootstrap , researchers have been able to apply resampling ideas in a variety of non - i.i.d .",
    "situations including the interesting case of dependent data .",
    "bhlmann  @xcite , lahiri  @xcite and politis  @xcite give reviews of the state - of - the - art in resampling time series and dependent data .    in the last two decades , in particular , resampling methods in the frequency domain have become increasingly popular ( see paparoditis  @xcite for a recent survey ) .",
    "one of the first papers to that effect was franke and hrdle  @xcite who proposed a bootstrap method based on resampling the periodogram in order to devise confidence intervals for the spectral density .",
    "the idea behind that approach is that a random vector of the periodogram ordinates at finitely many frequencies is approximately independent and exponentially distributed ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , brockwell and davis  @xcite , theorem 10.3.1 ) . later this approach was also pursued for different set - ups , for example , for ratio statistics such as autocorrelations by dahlhaus and janas  @xcite or in regression models by hidalgo  @xcite .",
    "dahlhaus and janas  @xcite suggested a modification of the periodogram bootstrap which leads to a correct approximation for a wider class of statistics such as the sample auto - covariance which  in contrast to the sample autocorrelation  is not a ratio statistic . kreiss and paparoditis  @xcite propose the autoregressive - aided periodogram bootstrap where a parametric time domain bootstrap is combined with a nonparametric frequency domain bootstrap in order to widen the class of statistics for which the bootstrap is valid .",
    "we will refer to the above methods as periodogram bootstrapping as all of the statistics of interest there were functionals of the periodogram . since these bootstrap methods resample the periodogram , they generally do not produce bootstrap pseudo - series in the time domain .",
    "a recent exception is a `` hybrid '' bootstrap of jentsch and kreiss  @xcite , that is , an extension of the aforementioned method of kreiss and paparoditis  @xcite .",
    "we now wish to focus on two well - known proposals on frequency - domain bootstrap methods that also yield replicates in the time domain , notably :    * the early preprint by hurvich and zeger  @xcite who proposed a parametric bootstrap very similar to our tft wild bootstrap of section  [ section_descr_boot ] , as well as a nonparametric frequency - domain bootstrap based on prewhitening via an estimate of the ma(@xmath0 ) transfer function .",
    "although never published , this paper has had substantial influence on time series literature as it helped inspire many of the above periodogram bootstrap methods .",
    "note hurvich and zeger  @xcite provide some simulations but give no theoretical justification for their proposed procedures ; indeed , the first theoretical justification for these ideas is given in the paper at hand as special cases of the tft - bootstrap .",
    "* the `` _ _ surrogate data _ _ '' approach of theiler et al .",
    "@xcite has received significant attention in the physics literature .",
    "the idea of the surrogate data method is to bootstrap the phase of the fourier coefficients but keep their magnitude unchanged .",
    "while most of the literature focuses on heuristics and applications , some mathematical proofs have been recently provided ( see braun and kulperger  @xcite , chan  @xcite , mammen and nandi  @xcite , and the recent survey by maiwald et al .",
    "the surrogate data method was developed for the specific purpose of testing the null hypothesis of time series linearity and is not applicable in more general settings . to see why , note that every surrogate sample has exactly the same periodogram ( and mean ) as the original sequence .",
    "hence , the method fails to approximate the distribution of any statistic that is a function of first- and second - order moments , thus excluding all cases where periodogram resampling has proven to be useful ; see our proposition  [ prop1 ] in section  [ section_diff_methods ] .    in the paper at hand",
    ", we propose to resample the fourier coefficients  which can effectively be computed using a fast fourier transform ( fft)in a variety of ways similar to modern periodogram bootstrap methods , and then obtain time series resamples using an inverse fft .",
    "since we start out with an observation sequence in the time domain , then jump to the frequency domain for resampling just to get back to the time domain again , we call this type of resampling a _ time frequency toggle _ ( tft ) bootstrap .",
    "the tft - bootstrap is an extension of existing periodogram bootstrap methods as it yields almost identical procedures when applied to statistics based on periodograms , but it is also applicable in situations where the statistics of interest are not expressible by periodograms ; for more details we refer to section  [ section_appl ] .",
    "the tft - bootstrap is related to the surrogate data approach but is more general since it also resamples the magnitudes of fourier coefficients and not just their phases . as a result ,",
    "the tft is able to correctly capture the distribution of statistics that are based on the periodogram .",
    "the tft , however , shares with the surrogate data approach the inability to approximate the distribution of the sample mean ; luckily , there are plenty of methods in the bootstrap literature to accomplish that , for example , the block bootstrap and its variations , the ar - sieve bootstrap , etc .",
    "( for details , see lahiri  @xcite , bhlmann  @xcite , politis  @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we provide some general theory for the tft - bootstrap which not only gives a long - due theoretical justification for one of the proposals by hurvich and zeger  @xcite but also allows for several modern extensions of these early ideas .",
    "in particular , we prove that the tft sample has asymptotically the correct second - order moment structure ( lemma  [ lem_cov ] ) and provide a functional central limit theorem ( fclt , theorem [ th_main ] and corollary  [ cor_main ] ) for the tft - sample .",
    "this is a much stronger result than the asymptotic normality with correct covariance structure of a finite subset as proved , for example , by braun and kulperger  @xcite for the surrogate data method .    as in the surrogate data method ,",
    "the tft sample paths are shown to be ( asymptotically ) gaussian ; so in a sense the tft approximates possibly nonlinear time series with a gaussian process having the correct second - order moment structure .",
    "this seems to be inevitable in all methods using discrete fourier transforms due to the fact that fourier coefficients are asymptotically normal under very general assumptions .",
    "however , in contrast to the surrogate data method , the tft is able to capture the distribution of many useful statistics ( cf .",
    "section [ section_appl ] ) .",
    "for example , our fclt implies the validity of inference for statistics such as cusum - type statistics in change - point analysis ( cf .",
    "section  [ section_cpa ] ) or least - squares statistics in unit - root testing ( cf .",
    "section  [ section_unitroot ] ) .",
    "the tft - bootstrap is also valid for periodogram - based ( ratio ) statistics such as sample autocorrelations or yule  walker estimators ; this validity is inherited by the corresponding results of the periodogram bootstrapping employed for the tft ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec_stat_perio ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in many practical situations one does not directly observe a stationary sequence but needs to estimate it first . in corollary [ cor_boot_est ]",
    "we prove the validity of the tft - bootstrap when applied to such estimated sequences .",
    "for example , in change - point analysis ( section  [ section_cpa ] ) as well as unit - root testing ( section [ section_unitroot ] ) one can use estimators to obtain an approximation of the underlying stationary sequence under the null hypothesis as well as under the alternative . as in both examples",
    "the null hypothesis is that of a stationary sequence ; this feature enables us to construct bootstrap tests that capture the null distribution of the statistic in question even when presented with data that obey the alternative hypothesis . as a consequence",
    ", these bootstrap tests asymptotically capture the correct critical value even under the alternative hypothesis which not only leads to the correct size of the tests but also to a good power behavior .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a detailed description on how the tft - bootstrap works .",
    "in particular we describe several specific possibilities of how to get pseudo - fourier coefficients . in section  [ section_fclt ] we state the main theorem , a functional limit theorem for the tft - bootstrap .",
    "the fclt holds true under certain high - level assumptions on the bootstrapped fourier coefficients ; these are further explored in sections  [ section_valboot ] and [ section_prop_freq ] .",
    "in particular it is shown that the tft - bootstrap replicates the correct second - order moment structure for a large class of observed processes including nonlinear processes ( cf .",
    "section [ section_prop_freq ] ) .",
    "finally , we prove the validity of the tft - bootstrap for certain applications such as unit - root testing or change - point tests in section  [ section_appl ] and explore the small sample performance in the simulation study of section  [ section_sim ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ section_conclusions ] .",
    "proofs are sketched in section  [ section_fclt_proof ] , while the complete technical proofs can be found in electronic supplementary material .",
    "assume we have observed @xmath1 , where    [ ass_w ] @xmath2 is a stationary process with absolutely summable auto - covariance function @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the spectral density of the process exists , is continuous and bounded .",
    "it is defined by @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , brockwell and davis  @xcite , corollary 4.3.2 ) .",
    "since we will prove a functional central limit theorem for the bootstrap sequence , the procedure only makes sense if the original process fulfills the same limit theorem .",
    "[ ass_clt ] @xmath2 fulfills the following functional central limit theorem : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spectral density of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a standard wiener process .",
    "we may need the following assumption on the spectral density :    [ ass_process_dens ] let the spectral density be bounded from below @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the centered counterpart of the observations where @xmath12 .",
    "consider the fft coefficients of the observed stretch , that is , @xmath13 thus @xmath14 where @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "note that the fourier coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 depend on @xmath19 , but to keep the notation simple we suppress this dependence .",
    "the principal idea behind all bootstrap methods in the frequency domain is to make use of the fact that the fourier coefficients @xmath20 are asymptotically independent and normally distributed , where @xmath21 denotes the largest integer smaller or equal to @xmath22 , and @xmath23\\\\[-8pt ] { \\operatorname{var}}x(j)&=&\\pi f(\\lambda_j)+o(1),\\qquad { \\operatorname{var}}y(j)= \\pi f(\\lambda_j)+o(1)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath6 is the spectral density ( see , e.g. , chapter 4 of brillinger  @xcite for a precise formulation of this vague statement ) .",
    "lahiri  @xcite gives necessary as well as sufficient conditions for the asymptotic independence and normality of tapered as well as nontapered fourier coefficients for a much larger class of time series not limited to linear processes in the strict sense .",
    "shao and wu  @xcite prove this statement uniformly over all finite subsets for a large class of linear as well as nonlinear processes with nonvanishing spectral density .",
    "the uniformity of their result is very helpful since it implies convergence of the corresponding empirical distribution function ( see the proof of lemma  [ lem_edf ] below ) .    the better known result on the periodogram ordinates states that @xmath26 are asymptotic independent exponentially distributed with expectation @xmath27 ( see , e.g. , chapter 10 of brockwell and davis  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is what most bootstrap versions are based on .",
    "by contrast , our tft - bootstrap will focus on the former property ( [ eq_fft_distr ] ) , that is , the fact that @xmath28 are asymptotically i.i.d . @xmath29",
    "let us now recall some structural properties of the fourier coefficients , which are important in order to understand the procedure below .",
    "first note that @xmath30 this symmetry implies that the fourier coefficients for @xmath31 carry all the necessary information required in order to recapture ( by inverse fft ) the original series up to an additive constant",
    ".    the symmetry relation ( [ eq_conj_com ] ) shows in particular that all the information carried in the coefficients for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , is already contained in the coefficients for @xmath32 , @xmath34 .",
    "the information that is missing is the information about the mean of the time series which is carried by the remaining coefficients belonging to @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( the latter only when @xmath19 is even ) .    to elaborate",
    ", @xmath37 carries the information about the mean of the observations @xmath38 ; moreover , @xmath39 for @xmath19 even , we further have some additional information about the `` alternating '' mean @xmath40 note that the value of the fft coefficients for @xmath31 is the same for a sequence @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "hence those fourier coefficients are invariant under additive constants and thus contain no information about the mean .",
    "similarly all the information about the bootstrap mean is carried only in the bootstrap version of @xmath43 [ as well as @xmath44 .",
    "the problem of bootstrapping the mean is therefore separated from getting a time series with the appropriate covariance structure and will not be considered here .",
    "in fact , we show that any asymptotically correct bootstrap of the mean if added to our bootstrap time series [ cf .",
    "( [ eq_form_bs2 ] ) ] yields the same asymptotic behavior in terms of its partial sums as the original uncentered time series .",
    "our procedure works as follows :    calculate the fourier coefficients using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .    let @xmath45 ; if @xmath19 is even , additionally let @xmath46 .",
    "obtain a bootstrap sequence @xmath47 using , for example , one of bootstrap procedures described below .",
    "set the remaining bootstrap fourier coefficients according to ( [ eq_conj_com ] ) , that is , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "use the inverse fft algorithm to transform the bootstrap fourier coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath16 , back into the time domain .",
    "we thus obtain a bootstrap sequence @xmath51 which is real - valued and centered , and can be used for inference on a large class of statistics that are based on partial sums of the centered process @xmath52 ; see section  [ section_cpa ] for examples .",
    "note that the exact form of @xmath53 is the following : @xmath54\\\\[-8pt ] & = & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{t}}\\sum_{j=1}^n\\bigl ( x^*(j)\\cos(2\\pi t j / t)-y^*(j)\\sin(2\\pi",

    "precisely , the bootstrap sequence @xmath58 gives a bootstrap approximation of @xmath7 .",
    "here , @xmath59 contains the information about the covariance structure of the time series , and @xmath60 contains the information of the sample mean as a random variable of the time series . how to obtain the latter will not be considered in this paper .    in corollary  [ cor_boot_est ]",
    "we give some conditions under which the above procedure remains asymptotically valid if instead of the process @xmath61 we use an estimated process @xmath62 ; this is important in some applications .",
    "now we are ready to state some popular bootstrap algorithms in the frequency domain .",
    "we have adapted them in order to bootstrap the fourier coefficients rather than the periodograms .",

    "robinson  @xcite proves such a result for certain kernel estimates of the spectral density based on periodograms for a large class of processes including but not limited to linear processes . for linear processes he also proves the consistency of the spectral density estimate as given above",
    "when an automatic bandwidth selection procedure is used .",
    "shao and wu  @xcite also prove this result for certain kernel estimates of the spectral density for processes satisfying some geometric - moment contraction condition , which includes a large class of nonlinear processes .",

    "the wild bootstrap also makes use of an estimated spectral density further exploiting the knowledge about the asymptotic normal distribution of the fourier coefficients .",
    "precisely , the wb replaces @xmath69 above by independent standard normal distributed random variables @xmath74 in order to obtain the bootstrap fourier coefficients as in ( [ eq_bc_b1 ] ) .",
    "this bootstrap was already suggested by hurvich and zeger @xcite , who considered it in a simulation study , but did not obtain any theoretical results .    an analogous approach  albeit focusing on the periodogram  was discussed by franke and hrdle  @xcite who proposed multiplying the periodogram with i.i.d .",
    "exponential random variables .",
    "the advantage of the local bootstrap is that it does not need an initial estimation of the spectral density .",
    "the idea is that in a neighborhood of each frequency the distribution of the different coefficients is almost identical ( if the spectral density is smooth )",
    ". it might therefore be better able to preserve some information beyond the spectral density that is contained in the fourier coefficients .",
    "an analogous procedure for periodogram ordinates was first proposed by paparoditis and politis  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will only consider bootstrap schemes that are related to kernels .",
    "recall that @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , and , for @xmath19 even , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 denotes the smallest integer larger or equal than @xmath82 ) .",
    "furthermore let @xmath83 be the fourier coefficients of the centered sequence .",

    "a rigorous theoretical comparison would entail higher - order considerations which are not available in the literature and are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "intuitively , one would expect the rb and lb procedures to perform similarly in applications since these two bootstap methods share a common underlying idea , that is , that nearby periodogram / fft ordinates are i.i.d .",
    "by contrast , the wb involves the generation of extraneous gaussian random variables thus forcing the time - domain bootstrap sample paths to be gaussian .",
    "for this reason alone , it is expected that if a higher - order property holds true in our setting , it will likely be shared by rb and lb but not wb . our finite - sample simulations in section  [ section_sim ] may hopefully shed some additional light on the comparison between rb and lb .",
    "first , note that the tft wild bootstrap is identical to the parametric frequency - domain bootstrap proposal of hurvich and zeger  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the nonparametric bootstrap proposal of hurvich and zeger  @xcite was based on prewhitening via an estimate of the ma(@xmath0 ) transfer function . estimating the transfer function presents an undesirable complication since prewhitening can be done in an easier fashion using any consistent estimator of the spectral density ; the residual - based tft exploits this idea based on the work of franke and hrdle  @xcite .",
    "the local bootstrap tft is a more modern extension of the same underlying principle , that is , exploiting the approximate independence ( but not i.i.d .- ness ) of periodogram ordinates .",
    "we now attempt to shed some light on the relation between the tft and the surrogate data method of theiler et al .",
    "@xcite . recall that the surrogate data approach amounts to using @xmath103 as bootstrap fourier coefficients at point @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the periodogram at point @xmath104 , and @xmath106 are i.i.d .",
    "uniform on @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "so the periodogram ( and mean ) computed from surrogate is identical to the original ones . as a result",
    "we have the following proposition .",
    "[ prop1 ] the surrogate data method fails to approximate the distribution of any statistic that can be written as a function of the periodogram ( and/or sample mean ) as long as this statistic has nonzero large - sample variance .",
    "the proof of this proposition is obvious since by replicating the periodogram ( and sample mean ) exactly , the surrogate approach will by necessity approximate the distribution of the statistics in question by a point mass , that is , zero variance .",
    "hence , the surrogate data method will not be able to correctly capture distributional properties for a large class of statistics that are based entirely on periodograms and the mean ( cf . also chan  @xcite ) . in hypothesis testing , this failure would result in having power equal to the size when the surrogate approach is applied to obtain critical values for test statistics based entirely on periodogram and/or mean ; at the very least , some loss of power in other situations can be expected .",
    "the aforementioned tft methods obviously do not have this disadvantage ; in fact , they can be successfully applied to this precise class of statistics ( cf . section  [ sec_stat_perio ] ) . for comparison purposes",
    ", we now describe a _",
    "nonsmoothed _ wild bootstrap that is the closest relative of the surrogate data method that fits in our framework .",
    "note that all tft - bootstrap schemes involve smoothing in the frequency domain before resampling ( cf .",
    "also assumption [ ass_boot_2b ] ) ; however , one could consider bootstrapping without this smoothing step . as the wild bootstrap works by multiplying normal random variables with an estimator of the spectral density , that is , a smoothed version of the periodogram , the nonsmoothed wild bootstrap multiplies normal random variables with the original fourier coefficients @xmath28 . by the box ",
    "muller transform , the nonsmoothed wild bootstrap gives the following as the bootstrap ( complex - valued ) fourier coefficient at point @xmath104 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 are i.i.d .",
    "uniform on @xmath107 $ ] independent from each other .",
    "comparing equation ( [ eq.s1234 ] ) to equation ( [ eq.t1234 ] ) we see that the surrogate data approach is closely related to the nonsmoothed wild bootstrap ; the main difference is that the wild bootstrap does not only bootstrap the phase but also the magnitude of the fourier coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , the nonsmoothed wild bootstrap does not suffer from the severe deficiency outlined in proposition  [ prop1 ] since it does manage to capture the variability of the periodogram to some extent . to elaborate , note that it is possible to prove a functional limit theorem [ like our theorem  [ th_main](a ) in the next section ] for the nonsmoothed wild bootstrap but only under the provision that a _ smaller resample size _ is employed ; that is , only a fraction of the bootstrap sample is used to construct the partial sum process ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this undersampling condition is necessary here since without it the asymptotic covariance structure would not be correct .",
    "hence , even the nonsmoothed wild bootstrap , although crude , seems ( a ) preferable to the surrogate data method and ( b ) inferior with respect to the tft - bootstrap ; this relative performance comparison is clearly born out in simulations that are not reported here due to lack of space .",
    "in this section we state the main result , namely a functional limit theorem for the partial sum processes of the bootstrap sample .    the theorem is formulated in a general way under some meta - assumptions on the resampling scheme in the frequency domain that ensure the functional limit theorem back in the time domain . in section [ section_valboot ]",
    "we verify those conditions for the bootstrap schemes given in the previous section .",
    "we would like to point out that the meta - assumptions we give are the analogues of what is usually proved for the corresponding resampling schemes of the periodograms , which are known to hold for a large class of processes .",

    "this is similar ( although maybe for different reasons ) to the block bootstrap for which gtze and knsch  @xcite showed that , in order to obtain second - order correctness of the procedure , one needs to studentize the bootstrap statistic with the true conditional variance of the bootstrap statistic ( which is closely related to the bartlett estimator ) , while for the original statistic one needs to use a different estimator such as the above mentioned flat - top estimator .",
    "however , a detailed theoretical investigation of which type of studentizing is best suitable for the tft - bootstrap is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "unit root testing is a well studied but difficult problem .",
    "key early references include phillips  @xcite and dickey and fuller  @xcite ( see also the books by fuller  @xcite and by hamilton  @xcite ) . nevertheless , the subject is still very much under investigation ( see , e.g. , cavaliere and taylor @xcite , chang and park  @xcite , park  @xcite , paparoditis and politis @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the objective here is to test whether a given set of observations @xmath314 belongs to a stationary or a @xmath315-time series ( integrated of order one ) , which means that the time series is not stationary , but its first - order difference @xmath316 is stationary . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath317 , and we do not consider a deterministic trend component in this paper .",
    "the hypothesis test of interest can then be stated as @xmath318 now we note that for @xmath319 the null hypothesis is equivalent to @xmath320 ( for a detailed discussion we refer to paparoditis and politis  @xcite , example 2.1 ) .",

    "while the bootstrap test below is valid for the general situation ( @xmath322 ) above , it is intuitively easier to understand if one considers the following restricted situation , where @xmath323 for some stationary @xmath7 with mean 0 and tests @xmath324 versus @xmath325 ; this is the setup we use in the simulations below .",
    "an intuitive test statistic ( cf .",
    "phillips  @xcite ) is given by @xmath326 rejecting the null hypothesis if @xmath327 for some appropriate critical value @xmath328 , where @xmath329 is a consistent estimator for @xmath330 under both the null hypothesis as well as the alternative .",
    "other choices for @xmath330 and @xmath331 are also possible ( for a detailed discussion , see section 2 of paparoditis and politis  @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath7 fulfills assumption  [ ass_clt ] with mean 0 and additionally @xmath332 then it holds under @xmath280 that @xmath333 where @xmath283 and @xmath6 is the spectral density of the stationary sequence @xmath316 , @xmath334 , and @xmath8 is a wiener process ( see also phillips  @xcite , theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "this shows that the limit distribution of @xmath335 depends on the unknown parameters @xmath336 as well as @xmath337 if the errors are dependent .",
    "the famous dickey  fuller test is closely related to the above test statistic just using a slightly different normalization , but it suffers from the same problem .",
    "phillips  @xcite and phillips and perron @xcite suggest some modifications of the two tests mentioned above which do have a pivotal limit for time series errors as well .",
    "later on , perron and ng  @xcite , stock  @xcite and ng and perron  @xcite propose to use the trinity of so - called @xmath338 unit root statistics , which are also closely related to the above two tests but have pivotal limits for time series errors as well . those @xmath338 unit root tests",
    "are given by @xmath339 as well as the product of the above two @xmath338 statistics .",
    "as before @xmath340 denotes an estimator of @xmath337 .",
    "in the simulations we use the estimator as given in ( [ est_flat_top ] ) .",
    "all of the above mentioned statistics are continuous functions of the partial sum process @xmath341 under the null hypothesis [ as @xmath342 , so that the null asymptotics are immediate consequences of the functional central limit theorem as given in assumption [ ass_clt ] . for the test statistic @xmath335 and the dickey ",
    "fuller test it is additionally needed that @xmath343 .",
    "for example , the statistic @xmath344 has the same asymptotic limit as the statistic @xmath335 with independent errors @xmath345 in the following we concentrate on the statistic @xmath344 but the results for the other mentioned statistics follow analogously .",
    "we would like to apply the tft - bootstrap to obtain critical values ; that means we need a bootstrap sequence which is ( conditionally ) @xmath315 . in order to obtain this",
    "we estimate @xmath321 , which is stationary under both @xmath280 as well as @xmath291 , by @xmath346 then we can use the tft - bootstrap based on @xmath62 , that is , create a tft - bootstrap sample @xmath347 and obtain a bootstrap @xmath315 sequence ( i.e. , a sequence fulfilling @xmath280 ) by letting @xmath348 the bootstrap analogue of the statistic @xmath349 is then given by @xmath350 where we use again the estimator @xmath351 as in ( [ boot_est_tau ] ) for the bootstrap sequence .",
    "the following theorem shows that the conditional limit of the bootstrap statistic is the same as that appearing in the rhs of ( [ eq_asym_mut ] ) no matter whether the original sequence follows the null or alternative hypothesis .",
    "this shows that the bootstrap critical values and thus also the bootstrap test is equivalent to the asymptotic critical values ( and thus the asymptotic test ) , under both the null hypothesis as well as alternatives .",

    "in the previous sections , the asymptotic applicability of the tft - bootstrap was investigated . in this section",
    "we conduct a small simulation study in order to show its applicability in finite samples .     with parameter @xmath357 and corresponding tft - bootstrap sample : residual - based bootstrap , bartlett ",
    "priestley kernel , @xmath358 . ]    to get a first impression of what a tft - bootstrap sample looks like , we refer to figure  [ fig_1 ] , which shows the original time series as well as one bootstrap sample . at first glance the covariance structure",
    "is well preserved .",
    "we use the statistical applications given in section [ section_appl ] to show that the tft - bootstrap is indeed applicable .",
    "the usefulness of the procedure for statistics based on periodograms have already been shown by several authors ( cf .",

    "however , the applicability for statistics that are completely based on time domain properties , such as the cusum statistic in change - point analysis or the above unit - root test statistics , is of special interest .",
    "more precisely we will compare the size and power of the tests with different parameters as well as give a comparison between the tft , an asymptotic test , and alternative block resampling techniques .",
    "for change - point tests , the comparison is with the block permutation test of kirch  @xcite ; in the unit - root situation we compare the tft - bootstrap to the block bootstrap of paparoditis and politis  @xcite . for the tft we use the local bootstrap ( lb ) as well as residual - based bootstrap ( rb ) with a uniform kernel ( uk ) as well as bartlett ",
    "priestley kernel ( bpk ) with different bandwidths .",
    "we visualize these qualities by the following plot :      the line corresponding to the null hypothesis shows the actual achieved level on the @xmath359-axis for a nominal one as given by the @xmath82-axis .",

    "we choose @xmath368 ; for @xmath369 we choose @xmath370 as changes are more difficult to detect for these time series .",
    "a comparison involving the uniform kernel ( uk ) , the bartlett ",
    "priestley kernel ( bpk ) as well as bandwidth @xmath358 and @xmath371 can be found in figure .",
    "it becomes clear that small bandwidths are best in terms of keeping the correct size , where the bpk works even better than the uk .",
    "however , this goes along with a loss in power which is especially severe for the bpk .",
    "furthermore , the power loss for the bpk kernel is worse if combined with the local bootstrap . generally speaking",

    "the results are given in figure  [ fig_2](e)[fig_2](f ) .",
    "the tft works best in terms of obtaining correct size , where the bpk beats the uk as already pointed out above .",
    "the power loss of the bpk is also present in comparison with the asymptotic as well as the block permutation methods ; the power of the uniform kernel is also smaller than for the other method but not as severe as for the bpk .",
    "the reason probably is the sensitivity of the tft with respect to the estimation of the underlying stationary sequence as in corollary  [ cor_main ] . in this example a mis - estimation of the change - point or the mean difference can result in an estimated sequence that largely deviates from a stationary sequence , while in the unit - root example below , this is not as important and in fact the power loss does not occur there .    the simulation results for a garch@xmath366 time series with parameters @xmath376 [ i.e. , @xmath377 , @xmath378 ,",
    "@xmath379 are given in figure [ fig_2](g ) and  [ fig_2](h ) , and it becomes clear that the conclusions are similar .",
    "the alternative in these plots is given by @xmath370 .",
    "in the unit root situation we need a bootstrap sample of @xmath61 as in corollary  [ cor_main ] , where we additionally use the fact that @xmath7 has mean @xmath118 . in this case",
    "we additionally need a bootstrap version of the mean . for simplicity",

    "it can be seen that again a small bandwidth yields best results , and in particular the bpk works better than the uk . unlike in the change - point example we do not have the effect of a power loss .",
    "furthermore unlike in change - point analysis the bootstrap works better for positively correlated errors",
    ".    a comparison with the asymptotic test as well as the block bootstrap by paparoditis and politis  @xcite can be found in figure  [ fig_3](e)[fig_3](f ) . in the case of a positive correlation",
    "all methods perform approximately equivalently , at least if we use the better working bartlett ",
    "priestley kernel ; however for a negative correlation the tft holds the level better than the other methods .",
    "some results for a garch@xmath366 error sequence with parameters @xmath385 are shown in figure  [ fig_3](g ) and  [ fig_3](h ) .",
    "in this situation a somewhat larger bandwidth of @xmath371 works slightly better and the tft test leads to an improvement of the power of the tests .",
    "it is noteworthy that the appropriate bandwidth in all cases is smaller than what one might have expected to be a good choice .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that some undersmoothing is appropriate since the back - transformation will account for some additional smoothing .",
    "the subject of the paper is the tft - bootstrap which is a general frequency domain bootstrap method that also generates bootstrap data in the time domain .",
    "connections of the tft - bootstrap with other methods including the surrogate data method of theiler et al .",
    "@xcite , and the original proposals of hurvich and zeger  @xcite were thoroughly explored .",
    "it was shown that the tft - bootstrap samples have asymptotically the same second - order moment structure as the original time series .",
    "however , the bootstrap pseudo - series are ( asymptotically ) gaussian showing that the tft - bootstrap approximates the original time series by a gaussian process with the same covariance structure even when the original data sequence is nonlinear ; see section  [ section_fclt ] .",
    "nevertheless , our simulations suggest that for small samples the tft - bootstrap gives a better approximation to the critical values ( as compared with the asymptotic ones ) especially when studentizing is possible . whether appropriate studentization results in higher - order correctness is a subject for future theoretical investigation",
    ". choosing somewhat different types of bootstrapping in the frequency domain could also lead to higher - order correctness without bootstrapping as in , for example , dahlhaus and janas  @xcite for the periodogram bootstrap .",
    "in fact the simulations suggest that a surprisingly small bandwidth ( in comparison to spectral density estimation procedures ) works best .",
    "when applied in a careful manner no smoothing at all still results  in theory  in a correct second - moment behavior in the time domain ( cf .",
