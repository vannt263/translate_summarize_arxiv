    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , once functional , will attempt to discover the last piece of the standard model ( sm ) puzzle ( the higgs boson , responsible for electro - weak breaking ) as well as hopefully provide signals of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "the main process responsible for producing a higgs boson at the lhc is gluon fusion , and a light boson produced in such fashion is then expected to decay into two photons .",
    "such a decay is supposed to be weak , as higgs interact only weakly and in the sm the process occurs at one - loop level only .    in a bsm scenario ,",
    "a new scalar field which is singlet under the sm gauge group can mix with the higgs boson but also couple to photons and gluons directly through higher dimensional operators with a cutoff scale @xmath4 .",
    "such a model has been proposed by georgi @xcite , based on the hypothesis that there could be an exact scale - invariant hidden sector at a high energy scale . below @xmath4 ,",
    "the model emerges as interpolating fields with general non - integral scaling dimension @xmath5 , which behave like a @xmath5 number of invisible massless particles  hence the term unparticle ( @xmath6 ) used by georgi .",
    "an unparticle does not posses a fixed invariant mass squared , but has a continuum mass spectrum , as a consequence of scale invariance @xmath7 with @xmath8 the normalization factor .",
    "the production of unparticles at low energies is described by an effective field theory and can give rise to peculiar energy distributions because of the non - integral values of @xmath5 .    while the concept dates only to 2007 @xcite ,",
    "there have been over 120 studies so far for implications of unparticle physics topics as varied as on neutrino physics @xcite cosmology @xcite , rare processes in the standard model @xcite , effects on precision measurements @xcite , as well as specific low energy signals for the detection of unparticles @xcite .",
    "the peculiarities of unparticle physics have motivated numerous studies of their implications at the colliders @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that among collider signals , unparticle self - interactions give rise to spectacular effects in gluon fusion processes .",
    "( note also the more recent study on unparticle self interactions @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , while the interactions @xmath9 lead to enhanced signals in the higgs boson decay channels , the three - point self - interactions @xmath10 are practically background free and may provide an unsuppressed and extremely promising signal for unparticle discovery .",
    "the unusual feature here is that the production of additional unparticles with high @xmath11 in the final states does not suppress the production rate , unlike the production of known particles @xcite .",
    "there is encouraging data from the l3 collaboration on @xmath12 interaction , which exceeds the prediction of the standard model by about one order of magnitude at the highest transverse momentum data @xcite , and gluon fusion might show similar enhancements . motivated by these considerations , in the present paper we extend the calculation in @xcite and we present a complete evaluation of the relevant diagrams , in a comparative fashion , for the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the hadron colliders : the lhc because of the large center - of - mass energy , and the tevatron , because it operates now and could produce visible signals of physics bsm .",
    "a similar analysis is possible for ilc , but for our purposes , it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we also update the tevatron bound on the three - point unparticle self interaction discussed in @xcite , based on the complete evaluation of the cross section .",
    "we proceed as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we describe briefly the unparticle model features , concentrating on the ones relevant for our considerations . in section",
    "[ sec : calculation ] we present the numerical investigation of processes generated by unparticle self interactions in @xmath13 and @xmath14 at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we compare the results obtained from production subprocesses , grouped by number of unparticles in intermediate states , and by channels .",
    "there are basically only two important unknown parameters , namely the scaling dimension @xmath5 and the cutoff scale @xmath4 .",
    "we restrict a third parameter , emerging from the three - point unparticle correlation function from the tevatron data .",
    "we discuss the results obtained and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] . in the appendix",
    "we give the complete list of relevant diagrams for our calculation .",
    "in this section , we summarize the basic features of unparticle physics . in order to be relevant",
    ", unparticles must interact with sm fields , although the detailed dynamics of the interactions are not known .",
    "these interactions are parameterized in the effective lagrangian approach as interactions between a new physics operator @xmath15 with dimension @xmath5 and the standard model operator @xmath16 with dimension @xmath17 @xmath18 with @xmath19 a coupling constant of order 1 . from scale invariance considerations ,",
    "the phase space for the unparticle operator is a continuous spectral density @xmath20 where @xmath8 is the normalization factor @xmath21 unparticle operators interact with the sm fields through the exchange of heavy particles of mass @xmath22 . integrating out the heavy fields produces a series of effective operators describing unparticle interactions with the sm fields at low energy @xcite .",
    "the operators describing the interactions for various unparticle spins are @xcite @xmath23 for the spin-0 case , the interaction of @xmath6 with a fermion pair is suppressed if there is a @xmath24 in the vertex and we neglect such terms .",
    "note also that , unlike the above form , in our study this vertex is defined with a higgs coupling such that the prefactor becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "otherwise , one needs to introduce two cutoff scale .",
    "the propagators for the unparticles were suggested to be @xcite : @xmath27 for the scalar , and @xmath28_{\\mu \\nu}=\\frac{a_{d_{\\cal u}}}{2 \\sin \\pi d_{\\cal u}}\\frac{i}{(|p^2|+i0^+)^{2-d_{\\cal u}}}\\ e^{i\\,\\phi}\\ , \\pi_{\\mu \\nu}(p)\\ ] ] and @xmath28_{\\mu \\nu , \\rho \\sigma}=\\frac{a_{d_{\\cal u}}}{2 \\sin \\pi d_{\\cal u}}\\frac{i}{(|p^2|+i0^+)^{2-d_{\\cal u}}}\\ e^{i\\,\\phi}\\ , t_{\\mu \\nu , \\rho \\sigma}(p)\\ ] ] for the spin-1 and spin-2 unparticle , respectively . the phase is defined as @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "thus , it is non - zero only in the s - channel where @xmath30 is positive while @xmath31 is identical to zero in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels . of course , the @xmath34 piece is only relevant in the @xmath2 channel . here",

    "in all the analyses that follow we take @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "we generated our results using the softwares feynarts and formcalc @xcite and the vegas monte carlo program for the four - body phase space integration as well as for the numerical evaluation of the function @xmath57 . in order to avoid collinear singularities ,",
    "we employ angular cuts as well as cuts on the transverse energies of the final photons and gluons .",
    "we require the final photons and gluons to have at least 30 gev transverse energy and their ejection directions make at least 10 degrees with the beamline in the forward and backward directions . since the unparticle model has unconventional features , the vertices and propagators the softwares feynarts and formcalc required some modifications .",
    "the hadronization is done by using the lhapdf version 5.3 @xcite with the parton distribution functions of cteq6ll .",
    "we neglect the masses of the light quarks in the proton while calculating the contributions from the quark pair .",
    "we also neglect the contributions from the sm diagrams but include the sm background separately .",
    "in fact , the sm backgrounds for and the signals go only through quark subprocesses at partonic level . under the same conditions , we estimated the background cross sections as follows : at the tevatron ; @xmath63 pb and @xmath64 pb for and , respectively ; at the lhc , @xmath65 pb ( for ) and @xmath66 pb ( for ) .    in order to keep track of various contributions and make comparisons , we group the graphs according to the partonic constituents ( @xmath44 or @xmath60 ) , the number of unparticles present in the intermediate states , and whether they proceed through the @xmath2 or the @xmath3 channel .",
    "we follow the same path in the numerical evaluation of each contribution , which we discuss in the following subsections .",
    "the existence of more than one external gluon requires an extra care . to preserve the gauge invariance one either needs to include the ghost contributions or perform the the gluon polarization sum for only the transversal polarization .",
    "we follow the second path by introducing appropriate projection operators for the transverse polarization states of the gluon .",
    "since one can still do the sum conventionally for one of the gluons , in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 subprocesses , we need a single and three projection operators , respectively , when summation over the gluon polarizations is performed ( for more details , see @xcite ) .      while the lhc seems to be still besieged by technical problems , it is worthwhile to explore signals coming the physics of the currently running largest energy collider facility , the tevatron at fermilab",

    "a more precise analysis would first fit the curves in fig .",

    "as we did not include this in our evaluations , our total cross section values obtained are more conservative .",

    "although this process is suppressed ( in fact negligible ) in the sm and can only proceed here though ( at least one ) unparticle exchange , the total cross section is dominated by the diagrams with the minimal number of internal unparticles .",

    "we then restrict the @xmath74 parameter based on the tevatron data .",
    "this was done previously , assuming the multiphoton process is dominated entirely by the three - unparticle exchange , where expressions for @xmath74 can be obtained independently of the unparticle scale @xmath4 . in a complete evaluation , terms with different numbers of unparticles",
    "enter the summation , and the restriction on @xmath74 becomes a restriction on the quadratic roots of a @xmath4-dependent equation , rather than a simple inequality .",
    "for completness , we present maximal bounds on @xmath74 for both three - unparticle exchanges , as well as for the total cross section .    in concluding , the main point of our paper is to show that multiphoton signals at hadron collider are significant if one includes the coupling of sm particles with one or several unparticles , and if observed , these events would be a strong indication of unparticle physics .",
