    "the kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite is one of the most widely used electronic structure theories for atoms , molecules and solids in various areas of physics , chemistry and molecular biology due to its computational efficiency and useful accuracy .",
    "it simplifies a many - electron wave - function problem to an auxiliary one - electron problem , with only its exchange - correlation part carrying the many - electron effects to be approximated in practice . among numerous exchange - correlation approximations , the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite ,",
    "the standard perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite , and the becke-3-lee - yang - parr ( b3lyp )  @xcite hybrid gga dominate the user market of dft  @xcite .",
    "the former two are efficient semilocal functionals widely used for extended systems , while the latter is a computationally more expensive nonlocal functional that hybridizes a gga with the exact exchange energy and is popular for finite systems . at the semilocal level , however , meta - gga ( mgga ) is the highest rung of the so - called jacob s ladder in dft @xcite and potentially the most accurate one @xcite , which can also serve as a better base for hybridizing with the exact exchange energy .",
    "semilocal approximations ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) of the form e_xc^sl[n _ , n_]=d^3r n _ xc^sl(n_,n _ , n_,n _ , _ , _ ) [ semi_local ] require only a single integral over real space and so are practical even for large molecules or unit cells . in eq . , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the electron densities of spin @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , @xmath4 the local gradients of the spin densities , @xmath5 the kinetic energy densities of the occupied ks orbitals @xmath6 of spin @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 the approximate exchange - correlation energy per electron .",
    "all equations are in atomic units . in addition to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the only ingredients in lsda , ggas also use the density gradients ; mggas additionally include the kinetic energy densities @xmath10 . with the encoded information of shell structures from the kinetic energy densities",
    ", mggas can distinguish different orbital - overlap regions @xcite , and thus deliver simultaneous accurate ground - state properties for molecules , surfaces , and solids  which could nt be obtained with a gga or lsda @xcite .",
    "computationally , mggas are not much more expensive than lsda or gga  @xcite . in computations for molecules containing transition - metal atoms ,",
    "the tao - perdew - staroverov - scuseria ( tpss ) @xcite mgga is only @xmath11 slower @xcite than pbe .    to understand the performance of mggas , a recent study  @xcite investigated the effect of @xmath12-dependence on mggas through the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath13",
    "here , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the von weizs@xmath16cker kinetic energy density , and @xmath17 is the kinetic energy density of the uniform electron gas ( ueg ) .",
    "@xmath18 is a lower bound on @xmath12 with @xmath19 only for a single - orbital region  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 measures locally how far @xmath21 deviates from being of single - orbital character on the scale of the ueg , and thus characterizes the extent of orbital overlap . besides the ability of @xmath22 to distinguish different orbital - overlap regions , ref",
    ".   further showed that the effect of the @xmath22-dependence on mggas is qualitatively equivalent to that of the dependence on the reduced density gradient @xmath23 $ ] , another dimensionless inhomogeneity parameter that measures how fast and how much the density varies on the scale of the local fermi wavelength @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26-dependence is well understood at the gga level  @xcite , which mggas inherit  @xcite .    as a result of the study on the @xmath12-dependence  @xcite , a simple exchange functional , where the @xmath22-dependence is disentangled from the @xmath26-dependence ,",
    "was constructed as an interpolation between the single - orbital regime ( @xmath27 ) and the slowly - varying density regime ( @xmath28 )  @xcite , which we will discuss more in section  [ sect : construction ] . in analogy to the monotonically increasing @xmath29dependence that ggas are often designed to have to favor more inhomogeneous electron densities , the simple exchange functional has a monotonically decreasing @xmath30dependence to favor more the single - orbital regions . when combined with a variant of the pbe correlation  @xcite , the resulting mggas ( denoted as mgga@xmath31ms with ms standing for `` made simple '' ) @xcite performs equally well for atoms , molecules , surfaces , and solids , with an overall performance that is comparable to the sophisticated revised tpss ( revtpss ) mgga @xcite",
    "moreover , mgga_ms yields excellent binding energies for the w6 water clusters  @xcite , even better than those from the highly parametrized m06-l mgga @xcite whose training sets include noncovalent interactions ( hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions ) . further tests on general main group thermochemistry , kinetic , and noncovalent interactions  @xcite showed that mgga_ms , though not as good as m06-l , systematically improves the descriptions for the noncovalent interactions over conventional semilocal functionals , e.g. , pbe , tpss , and revtpss .    by including training sets of noncovalent interactions ,",
    "the m06-l mgga was trained to capture medium - range exchange and correlation energies that dominate equilibrium structures of noncovalent complexes @xcite .",
    "for example , m06-l delivers good binding energies for the s22 set that is dominated by noncovalent interactions and will be discussed more in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] , good structural and energetical properties of layered materials bound by van der waals interactions ( e.g. , graphite , hexagonal boron nitride , and molybdenum disulfite  @xcite ) , and good adsorption energies of aromatic molecules adsorbed on coinic metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "m06-l represents one of the developments of mggas that are fitted to a variety of training sets with numerous parameters to try to improve different properties together  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be stressed that too many fitting parameters could cause problems , e.g. , convergence of calculations and the related smoothness of binding curves  @xcite , and the prediction for systems far from training sets might not be realistic  @xcite .",
    "semilocal ( sl ) approximations can be reasonably accurate for the near - equilibrium and compressed ground - state properties of `` ordinary '' matter , where neither strong correlation nor long - range van der waals interaction is important .",
    "however , stretched bonds that arise in transition states of chemical reactions or in the dissociation limits of some radical or heteronuclear molecules , etc .",
    ", require full nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "the global hybrid functionals discussed later can provide such needed nonlocality .",
    "long - range van der waals interactions , originated from spontaneous correlations between two distant electron densities , also require full nonlocality  @xcite , which is different from the previous one  @xcite . to obtain long - range van der waals interactions , there are various dft - based dispersion techniques , including the post - dft empirical pairwise potential corrections  @xcite and the van der waals density functionals ( vdw - dfs )  @xcite , which are based on the pairwise additivity and problematic for metallic systems  @xcite .",
    "see ref .   for an overview of the progess on dft - based dispersion techniques .",
    "conventional semilocal functionals , e.g. , the widely used pbe gga , even lack the ability to describe noncovalent interactions near equilibrium , while the m06-l mgga and mgga_ms as well as its variant proposed here improve over pbe .",
    "the global hybrid ( gh ) idea , due to becke  @xcite , introduces some full nonlocality into the calculation but only at the level of @xmath32 , which can be evaluated semianalytically from the kohn - sham orbitals in some computer codes . in its simplest ( one parameter ) version  @xcite : e_xc^gh = ae_x^exact+(1-a)e_x^sl+e_c^sl [ global_hybrid ] where the exact - exchange mixing parameter @xmath33 takes an empirical value in the range @xmath34 . a rough but convincing argument @xcite for why eq .",
    "( [ global_hybrid ] ) works is : semilocal exchange - correlation typically overestimates atomization energies and underestimates energy barriers of chemical reactions , while exact exchange without correlation makes errors of the opposite sign , so that mixing of the two will yield better atomization energies and barriers than either alone .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath33 vary with the choice of semilocal functionals when fitting eq .",
    "( [ global_hybrid ] ) to formation enthalpies .",
    "the more a semilocal functional overbinds molecules , the larger the value of @xmath33 is .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found @xmath33 to be 0.60 for the pbesol gga , 0.32 for the pbe gga , and 0.1 for the tpss and revtpss mggas .",
    "improving the underlying semilocal functional reduces the value of @xmath33 needed to fit the atomization energies or enthalpies of formation , which however can worsen the barrier heights . some global hybrids",
    "@xcite thus employ highly fitted semilocal parts intended not to be accurate by themselves but to work well with a fraction of exact exchange .",
    "the popular b3lyp  @xcite hybrid gga has a somewhat more complicated form and reads : @xmath35    where @xmath36  @xcite is the lsda correlation energy in the random phase approximation which does not yield the correct uniform electron gas limit . in the equation , a=0.2 , b=0.72 , and c=0.81 . if we use the similar idea as in eq .   to define the underlying semilocal functional for b3lyp by replacing @xmath32 with @xmath37",
    ", we end up with a gga , denoted as blyp@xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "blyp@xmath38 differs from blyp in reducing the gradient correction of the b88 exchange to ( a+b)=92% and mixing the vwn3 and lyp correlations .",
    "this difference confirms the rough argument of the previous paragraph . typically , blyp underbinds molecules , and inclusion of exact exchange worsens the underbinding .",
    "the reduction of the gradient correction of the b88 exchange and the mixture of the vwn3 and lyp correlations then turn blyp@xmath38 into an overbinding functional suitable for hybridization with the exact exchange .",
    "the idea of tuning the gradient correction of b3lyp can be transfered to the construction of our hybrid mgga , where both the @xmath29dependence and the @xmath30dependence are tuned .    in the next section",
    ", we will present the computational details , followed by the constructions of semilocal and hybrid mggas in section [ sect : construction ] .",

    "note that pbe , tpss , revtpss , and mgga_ms0 are nonempirical functionals , while the number of empirical parameters  as indicated in the parentheses  of mgga_ms1 ( 1 ) , mgga_ms2 ( 2 ) , tpssh ( 1 ) , revtpssh ( 1 ) , and mgga_ms2h ( 3 ) are an order of magnitude smaller than those of m06-l and m06 .",
    "mgga_ms1 performs better than mgga_ms2 and mgga_ms0 for all molecular test sets discussed so far .",

    "mgga_ms0 and mgga_ms2 yield results that are close to the vdw - df  @xcite which is on step 3 of this classification , while mgga_ms1 fits best to the ground ( below step 1 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the classification is methodological and not based on performance as some functionals in step 1 and 2 outperform some funtionals on step 3 in ref . .",
    "table  [ table : s22_d3 ] gives results of the mgga_ms functionals with the d3 correction of grimme _ et al _",
    "the parameters in the d3 correction term were optimized by fitting to the s22 data set for each functional .",
    "we found that the optimization is insensitive with respect to the parameter @xmath73 , and thus set @xmath74 .",
    "then , there is only one fitting parameter @xmath75 left in the d3 correction term .",
    "@xmath75 , which is the scaling factor of cutoff radii and determines the range of the dispersion correction inversely  @xcite , is 1.15 , 1.05 , 1.14 , and 1.14 for mgga_ms0 , mgga_ms1 , mgga_ms2 , and mgga_ms2h , respectively .",
    "all the four mgga_ms functionals with the d3 corrections deliver for the s22 data set similar maes around 0.3 kcal / mol , which are among the best of the d3-corrected functionals tested in ref .  .",
    "the smaller @xmath75 for mgga_ms1 indicates that mgga_ms1 captures less intermediate - range weak interactions than the other three do , as also shown in table  [ table : s22 ] .",
    "table  [ table : s22_d3 ] also shows that the d3 corrections have noticeable effects on the formation energies and the barrier heights .",
    "mgga_ms1+d3 is the best among the three mggas , while the hybrid mgga_ms2h+d3 improves further the formation energies and the barrier heights .",
    "the functional pairs of global hybrid and its corresponding semilocal complement perform very similarly for weak interactions on average .",
    "the pair of blyp * and b3lyp is the outlier , which might be related to the fact that b88 is too repulsive for rare gas dimers even when comparing to the exact exchange  @xcite .",
    "this general trend suggests that the performance of a hybrid of a semilocal functional inherits its performance for weak interactions from its corresponding pure semilocal functional .",
    "a possible explanation is that weak interactions are mainly correlation effects where exact exchange does not contribute . on the other hand ,",
    "heats of formation , atomization energies , and barrier heights are significantly affected by correlation and exact exchange contributions . however , in our constructions , mgga_ms2 is a byproduct of mgga_ms2h , which is fitted to the atomization energies of the g2/97 test set and the barrier heights of the bh42/03 .",
    "surprisingly , mgga_ms2h performs reasonably well for the s22 set , much better than the other four hybrids , namely , pbeh , tpssh , revtpssh , and b3lyp .",
    "note the improvement of mgga_ms2h over the other four hybrids on the weak interactions is not a result of sacrifice of accuracy for atomization energies and barrier heights as shown in table [ table : g3bh76 ] .",
    "the good performance of mgga_ms2h on the s22 set is then transfered to mgga_ms2 .    when considering both tables [ table : g3bh76 ] and [ table : s22 ] for the properties of atomization energies , barrier heights , and weak interactions , our three - parameter global hybrid mgga_ms2h overall is the second best hybrid after m06 that is heavily parameterized .",
    "compared to mgga_ms2h , our semilocal functional mgga_ms1 performs surprisingly well for atomization energies of molecules and barrier heights of chemical reactions although it contains just one empirical parameter .",
    "however , the gain is obtained at the price of descriptions for weak interactions as demonstrated by the comparison with mgga_ms0 in table [ table : s22 ] .",
    "this shows the limit of tuning only the @xmath29dependence of the enhancement factor .",
    "fortunately , by tuning the @xmath30dependence additionally , mgga_ms2 improves over mgga_ms0 for the atomization energies significantly while remaining comparable for the barrier heights and weak interactions .",
    "by taking advantage of the understanding on the kinetic - energy - density dependence of mggas @xcite , we construct a global hybrid meta - generalized gradient approximation ( hybrid meta - gga ) with three empirical parameters ( mgga_ms2h ) , which has robust performances on the molecular systems for the properties of heats of formation , barrier heights , and noncovalent interactions .",
    "the derived underlying mgga_ms2 improves over the original mgga_ms0 @xcite for heats of formation significantly while retaining good performance for barrier heights and weak interactions . by relaxing the parameter @xmath59 of mgga_ms0",
