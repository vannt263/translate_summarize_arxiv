    "the goal of this chapter is to apply the techniques of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) to cosmological spacetimes .",
    "the resulting framework is known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) .",
    "this chapter has a two - fold motivation : to highlight various developments on the theoretical and conceptual issues in the last decade in the framework of loop quantum cosmology , and to demonstrate the way these developments open novel avenues for explorations of planck scale physics and the resulting phenomenological implications .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "cosmological spacetimes provide a very useful stage to make significant progress on many conceptual and technical problems in quantum gravity .",
    "these geometries have the advantage of being highly symmetric , since spatial homogeneity reduces the infinite number of degrees of freedom to a finite number , significantly simplifying the quantization of these spacetimes .",
    "difficult challenges and mathematical complexities still remain , but they are easier to overcome than in more general situations .",
    "the program of canonical quantization of the gravitational degrees of freedom of cosmological spacetimes dates back to wheeler and de witt @xcite . in recent years",
    ", lqc has led to significant insights and progress in quantization of these mini - superspace cosmological models and fundamental questions have been addressed .",
    "these include : whether and how the classical singularities are avoided by quantum gravitational effects ; how a smooth continuum spacetime emerges from the underlying quantum theory ; how do quantum gravitational effects modify the classical dynamical equations ; the problem of time and inner product ; quantum probabilities ; etc .",
    "( see @xcite for reviews in the subject ) .",
    "spacetimes where detailed quantization has been performed include friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) @xcite , bianchi @xcite and gowdy models @xcite , the latter with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "a coherent picture of singularity resolution and planck scale physics has emerged based on a rigorous mathematical framework , complemented with powerful numerical techniques .",
    "this new paradigm has provided remarkable insights on quantum gravity , and allowed a systematic exploration of the physics of the very early universe . on the other hand ,",
    "simplifications also entail limitations . since the formulation and the resulting physics is most rigorously studied in the mini - superspace setting , it is natural to question its robustness when infinite number of degrees of freedom are present , and whether the framework captures the implications from the full quantum theory .",
    "the problem of relating a model with more degrees of freedom to its symmetry reduced version is present even at the mini - superspace level . in this setting important insights",
    "have been gained on the relation between the loop quantization of bianchi - i spacetime and spatially flat ( @xmath0 ) isotropic model , which provide useful lessons to relate quantization of spacetimes with different number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "moreover , the belinskii - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite  that the structure of the spacetime near the singularities is determined by the time derivatives and spatial derivatives become negligible , which is substantiated by rigorous mathematical and numerical results @xcite , alleviates some of these concerns and provides a support to the quantum cosmology program . finally , recently there has been some concrete progress on the relation between lqc and full lqg , discussed briefly in section 6 . from the phenomenological perspective",
    ", we are experiencing a fascinating time in cosmology .",
    "the observational results of wmap @xcite and planck @xcite satellites have provided strong evidence for a primordial origin of the cmb temperatures anisotropies .",
    "there is no doubt that the excitement in early universe cosmology is going to continue for several more years , providing a promising opportunity to test implications of quantum gravity in cosmological observations .",
    "this chapter provides a review , including the most recent advances , of loop quantization of cosmological spacetimes and phenomenological consequences .",
    "it is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] provides a summary of loop quantization of the spatially flat , isotopic and homogeneous model sourced with a massless scalar field .",
    "this model was the first example of the rigorous quantization of a cosmological spacetime in lqc @xcite .",
    "because the quantization strategy underlying this model has been implemented for spacetimes with spatial curvature , anisotropies and also in presence of inhomogeneities , we discuss it in more detail . after laying down the classical framework in ashtekar variables ,",
    "we discuss the kinematical and dynamical features of loop quantization and the way classical singularity is resolved and replaced by a bounce .",
    "this section also briefly discusses the effective continuum spacetime description which provides an excellent approximation to the underlying quantum dynamics for states which are sharply peaked . for a specific choice of lapse , equal to the volume , and for the case of a massless scalar field one obtains an exactly solvable model of lqc ( slqc ) which yields important robustness results on the quantum bounce @xcite . in sec . 3",
    ", we briefly discuss the generalization of loop quantization and the resulting planck scale physics to spacetimes with spatial curvature , bianchi , and gowdy models .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to cosmological perturbations .",
    "we review the formulation of a quantum gravity extension of the standard theory of gauge invariant cosmological perturbations in lqc .",
    "these techniques provide the theoretical arena to study the origin of matter and gravitational perturbations in the early universe .",
    "this is the goal of section [ sec5 ] where we summarize the lqc extension of the inflationary scenario and discuss the quantum gravity corrections to physical observables @xcite .",
    "due to space limitations , it is difficult to cover various topics and details in this chapter .",
    "these include the earlier developments in lqc @xcite , the path integral formulation of lqc @xcite , entropy bounds @xcite , consistent quantum probabilities @xcite , application to black hole interiors @xcite , and various mathematical @xcite and numerical results @xcite in lqc .",
    "issues with inverse triad modifications @xcite , limitations of the earlier quantizations in lqc and the role of fiducial scalings @xcite , and issues related to quantization ambiguities and the resulting physical effects @xcite are also not discussed . for a review of some of these developments and issues in lqc ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite and the above cited references .",
    "we are also unable to cover all the existing ideas to study lqc effects on cosmic perturbations .",
    "see for different approaches to that problem .",
    "further information can be found in the chapter `` loop quantum gravity and observations '' by barrau and grain in this volume , and in the review articles @xcite .",
    "related to lqc , there have been developments in spin foams and group field theory , for which we refer the reader to refs.@xcite .",
    "our convention for the metric signature is @xmath1 , we set @xmath2 but keep @xmath3 and @xmath4 explicit in our expressions , to emphasize gravitational and quantum effects .",
    "when numerical values are shown , we use planck units .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the key steps in loop quantization of homogeneous cosmological models using the example of spatially flat flrw spacetime sourced with a massless scalar field @xmath5 . though simple , this model is rich in physics and provides a blueprint for the quantization of models with spatial curvature , anisotropies and other matter fields .",
    "loop quantization of this spacetime was first performed in refs .",
    "@xcite where a rigorous understanding of the quantum hamiltonian constraint , the physical hilbert space and the dirac observables was obtained , and detailed physical predictions were extracted using numerical simulations .",
    "it was soon realized that this model can also be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "this feature serves as an important tool to test the robustness of the physical predictions obtained using numerical simulations . in the following , in sec .",
    "2.1 , we begin with the quantization of this cosmological model in the volume representation .",
    "we discuss the classical and the quantum framework , and the main features of the quantum dynamics .",
    "we also briefly discuss the effective spacetime description which captures the quantum dynamics in lqc for sharply peaked states to an excellent approximation and provides a very useful arena to understand various phenomenological implications .",
    "the exactly solvable model is discussed in sec .",
    "2.2 .      in the following ,",
    "we outline the classical and the quantum framework of lqc in the spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous spacetime following the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite . in literature",
    "this quantization is also known as ` @xmath6 quantization ' or ` improved dynamics ' @xcite . in the first part",
    "we introduce the connection variables , establish their relationship with the metric variables , find the classical hamiltonian constraint in the metric and the connection variables and obtain the singular classical trajectories in the relational dynamics expressing volume as a function of the internal time @xmath5 .",
    "this is followed by the quantum kinematics , properties of the quantum hamiltonian constraint in the geometric ( volume ) representation , the physical hilbert space and a summary of the physical predictions . a comparison with the wheeler - dewitt theory is also provided both at the kinematical and the dynamical level . an effective description of the quantization performed here , following the analysis of refs.@xcite is discussed in sec . 2.1.3 .",
    "the spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic spacetime is typically considered with a spatial topology @xmath7 or of a 3-torus @xmath8 . for the non - compact spatial manifold extra care",
    "is needed to introduce the symplectic structure in the canonical framework because of the divergence of the spatial integrals . for the non - compact case one introduces a fiducial cell @xmath9 , which acts as an infra - red regulator @xcite .",
    "physical implications must be independent of the choice of this regulator , which is the case for the present analysis .",
    "such a cell is not required for the compact topology .",
    "the spacetime metric is given by s^2 = - t^2 + a^2 _ ab x^a x^b where @xmath10 is the proper time , @xmath11 denotes the scale factor of the universe and @xmath12 denotes the fiducial metric on the spatial manifold.with the matter source as the massless scalar field which serves as a physical clock in our analysis , instead of proper time it is natural to introduce a harmonic time @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 since @xmath5 satisfies the wave equation @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to the choice of the lapse @xmath16 . the spacetime metric then becomes s^2 = - a^6 ^2 + a^2 ( x_1 ^ 2 + x_2 ^ 2 + x_3 ^ 2 )  . in terms of the physical spatial metric @xmath17 ,",
    "the physical volume of the spatial manifold is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the comoving volume of the fiducial cell in case the topology is @xmath7 , or the comoving volume of @xmath8 in case the topology is compact .    due to the underlying symmetries of this spacetime , the spatial diffeomorphism constraint is satisfied and the only non - trivial constraint is the the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "let us first obtain this constraint in the metric variables .",
    "in such a formulation , the canonical pair of gravitational phase space variables consists of the scale factor @xmath11 and its conjugate @xmath20 , with ` dot ' denoting derivative with respect to the proper time .",
    "these variables satisfy @xmath21 .",
    "the matter phase space variables are @xmath5 and @xmath22 , which satisfy @xmath23 . in terms of the metric variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is given by [ hc1 ] c_h = - + 0 , which yields the classical friedman equation in terms of the energy density , @xmath24 , for the spatially flat frw model : [ classicalfried ] ( ) ^2 =  . in order to obtain the classical hamiltonian constraint in terms of the variables used in lqg : the ashtekar - barbero su(2 ) connection @xmath25 and the conjugate triad @xmath26",
    ", we first notice that due to the symmetries of the isotropic and homogeneous spacetime , the connection @xmath25 and triad @xmath26 can be written as @xcite a^i_a = c v_o^-1/3 ^i_a ,   e^a_i = p v_o^-2/3 ^a_i  , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the isotropic connection and triad , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the fiducial triads and co - triads compatible with the fiducial metric @xmath12 .",
    "the canonically conjugate pair @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 , and is related to the metric variables as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the barbero - immirzi parameter in lqg , whose value is set to @xmath36 using black hole thermodynamics @xcite . the modulus sign over the triad arises because of the two possible orientations , the choice of which does not affect physics in the absence of fermions .",
    "it is important to note that the above relation between the triad and the scale factor is true kinematically , whereas the relation between the isotropic connection and the time derivative of the scale factor is true only for the physical solutions of gr .",
    "it turns out that in the quantum theory , it is more convenient to work with variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 which are defined in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xcite : [ bv ] : = , : = sgn(p ) , where sgn(p ) is @xmath39 depending on whether the physical and fiducial triads have the same orientation ( + ) , or the opposite ( - ) .",
    "the conjugate variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfy @xmath40 , and in terms of which the classical hamiltonian constraint becomes [ hc3 ] c_h = - ^2 || + 0 .for a given value of @xmath41 and for a given triad orientation , hamilton s equations yield an expanding and a contracting trajectory , given by [ traj ] = + _ c where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are integration constants .",
    "both trajectories encounter a singularity . in the classical theory ,",
    "the existence of a singularity either in past of the expanding branch or in the future of the contracting branch is thus inevitable .      to pass to the quantum theory ,",
    "the strategy is to promote the classical phase variables and the classical hamiltonian constraint to their quantum operator analogs .",
    "for the metric variables , this startegy leads to the wheeler - dewitt quantum cosmology . since",
    ", we wish to obtain a loop quantization of the cosmological spacetimes based on lqg we can not use the same strategy for the connection - triad variables . in lqg ,",
    "variables used for quantization are the holonomies of the connection @xmath44 along edges , and the fluxes of the triads along 2-surfaces .",
    "( see _ chapter 1_. ) for the homogeneous spacetimes , the latter turn out to be proportional to the triad @xcite .",
    "the holonomy of the symmetry reduced connection @xmath25 along a straight edge @xmath45 with fiducial length @xmath46 is , h_k^ ( ) = ( ) + 2 ( ) _ k where @xmath47 is a unit @xmath48 matrix and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are the pauli spin matrices . due to the symmetries of the homogeneous spacetime ,",
    "the holonomy and flux are thus captured by functions @xmath51 of @xmath27 , and the triads @xmath28 respectively .",
    "since @xmath46 can take arbitrary values , @xmath52 are _ almost periodic functions _ of the connection @xmath27 . the next task is to find the appropriate representation of the abstract @xmath53-algebra generated by almost periodic functions of an unrestricted real variable @xmath54 is almost periodic if @xmath55 holds to an arbitrary accuracy for infinitely many values of @xmath13 , such that translations @xmath13 are spread over the whole real line without arbitrarily large intervals @xcite .",

    "it turns out that there exists a unique kinematical representation of algebra generated by these functions in lqc @xcite .",
    "this result has parallels with existence of a unique irreducible representation of the holonomy - flux algebra in full lqg @xcite .",
    "the gravitational sector of the kinematical hilbert space @xmath57 underlying this representation in lqc is a space of square integrable functions on the bohr compactification of the real line : @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "use of holonomies in place of connections does not directly affect the matter sector .",
    "for this reason , the matter sector of the kinematical hilbert space is obtained by following the methods in the fock quantization .",
    "it is important to note the difference between the gravitational part of @xmath57 , and the one obtained by following the wheeler - dewitt procedure where the gravitational part of the kinematical hilbert space is @xmath59 . in lqc ,",
    "the normalizable states are the countable sum of @xmath52 , which satisfy : @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a kronecker delta .",
    "this is in contrast to the wheeler - dewitt theory where one obtains a dirac delta .",
    "thus , the kinematical hilbert space in lqc is fundamentally different from one in the wheeler - dewitt theory .",
    "the intersection between the kinematical hilbert space in lqc and the wheeler - dewitt theory consists only of the zero function . since the system has only a finite degrees of freedom",
    ", one may wonder why the the von - neumann uniqueness theorem , which leads to a unique schrdinger representation in quantum mechanics , does not hold .",
    "it turns out that for the theorem to be applicable in lqc , @xmath52 should be weakly continuous in @xmath46 .",

    "further , physical predictions are insensitive to the choice of the lattice parameter . in the following analysis",
    "we choose @xmath96 , since this choice of lattice parameter results in the possibility of the evolution encountering the classical singularity at the zero volume .",

    "before we discuss some of the key features of the quantum hamiltonian constraint in lqc and the resulting physics , we note that a similar analysis goes through for the wheeler - dewitt theory based on the metric variables . at a kinematical level ,",
    "the wheeler - dewitt hilbert space consists of wavefunctions @xmath98 on which the scale factor and @xmath5 operators act multiplicatively , and the operators corresponding to their conjugate variables act as differential operators . the physical states are found by promoting @xmath99 ( [ hc1 ] ) to an operator and solving @xmath100 .",
    "the resulting quantum constraint turns out to be a differential equation @xcite : [ wdwcons ] _ ^2 ( z , ) = 12 g _",
    "z^2 ( z , ) = : - ( z , ) where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the evolution operator in wheeler - dewitt theory .",
    "this brings out another fundamental difference between the wheeler - dewitt theory and lqc . unlike the wheeler - dewitt theory ,",
    "the quantum constraint in lqc is a discrete operator with discreteness determined by the underlying quantum geometry in lqg . for the scales where the spacetime curvature is very small",
    "compared to the planck scale , which corresponds to the large volumes for the present model , the @xmath89 operator in lqc approximates the @xmath102 operator in the wheeler - dewitt theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the continuum differential geometry is recovered from the underlying discrete quantum geometry at the small spacetime curvature .",
    "quantum evolution of physical states can be studied numerically using the quantum constraint eq.([thetacons ] ) .",
    "one considers an initial state far away from the planck regime , with large volumes peaked at a certain value of @xmath41 at a classical trajectory .",
    "recall that in the classical theory , for a given value of @xmath41 there exists an expanding and a contracting trajectory which are disjoint and singular . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the state can be either chosen such that it is peaked on the expanding trajectory at late times or on the contracting trajectory at early times . using @xmath5 as a clock , such a state ,",
    "say chosen peaked on the expanding trajectory , is then numerically evolved towards the classical big bang singularity .",
    "the first numerical simulations were carried out using sharply peaked gaussian states @xcite .",
    "such states were shown to remain sharply peaked on the classical expanding trajectory for a long time in the backward evolution , till the spacetime curvature reaches approximately a percent of the planck curvature . at the higher curvature scales , departures between the classical trajectory and quantum evolution",
    "become significant , and the loop quantum universe bounces when the energy density reaches a maximum value @xmath103 @xcite . after the bounce , the quantum evolution is such that the state becomes sharply peaked on the classical contracting trajectory .",
    "quantum gravitational effects thus bridge the two singular classical trajectories providing a non - singular evolution avoiding the classical singularity .",
    "a result of the variation of volume with respect to internal time from a typical simulation is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 where the lqc evolution is also compared with the two classical trajectories in general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the quantum geometric effects play role only near the bounce and quickly become negligible when spacetime curvature becomes small .",
    "these studies have been recently generalized for very widely spread states and highly squeezed and non - gaussian states which capture the evolution of more quantum universes @xcite , using high performance computing and faster algorithms @xcite .",
    "the results of quantum bounce are found to be robust for all types of states .",
    "the existence of bounce does not require any fine tuning of the parameters or any special conditions .",
    "the quantum bounce is also found to be robust for slightly different quantization prescriptions in lqc @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the loop quantum evolution , the quantum evolution of wheeler - dewitt states yields a strinkingly different picture .",
    "initial states peaked on a classical trajectory remained peaked throughout the evolution and encounter the classical singularity . for the wheeler - dewitt states , the expectation values of the volume",
    "observable lie on the classical trajectory for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we find that unlike in the wheeler - dewitt theory , in lqc classical singularities are replaced by the bounce . the existence of bounce is tied to the underlying discrete quantum geometry  a feature which is absent in the wheeler - dewitt theory .",
    "the quantum evolution for various states in lqc illustrates the way classical gr is recovered in the low curvature regime .",
    "thus , lqc not only provides a non - singular ultra - violet extension of the classical cosmological models , but also leads to the desired infra - red limit .",
    "finally , we note that this feature provides an important criterion to single out the @xmath6 quantization as performed in the above analysis of the various possible choices @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is useful to note that in the earlier quantization of lqc , called the @xmath104 scheme in literature , edge lengths of the loop over which holonomies were constructed were considered to be constant @xcite . it does not yield the correct infra - red limit and can lead to ` quantum gravitational effects ' at arbitrarily small spacetime curvatures @xcite .",
    "these difficulties are shared by the lattice refined models @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the conclusion that @xmath6 quantization @xcite is the only consistent quantization in lqc is not solely tied to the infra - red limit of the theory .",
    "this conclusion can also be reached by demanding that the physical predictions be invariant under the rescalings of the fiducial cell @xcite , by demanding the stability of the quantum difference equation @xcite and by demanding that the factor ordering ambiguities in gravitational part of the quantum constraint in lqc disappear in the limit where wheeler - dewitt theory is approached @xcite .",
    "all these independent arguments provide a robust understanding of the viability of the @xmath6 quantization of the cosmological spacetimes .      in sec .",
    "2.1.2 we discussed the way underlying quantum geometry in lqg results in a quantum difference equation in lqc .",
    "evolution of states with this difference equation predict a quantum bounce at the planck scale .",
    "the question we are interested in now is whether it is possible to capture the key features of the quantum evolution , including the quantum bounce , in a continuum spacetime description at an effective level , allowing an @xmath4-dependence in the metric coefficients .",
    "if so , is it possible to obtain a modified differential friedman and raychaudhuri equations which incorporate the leading quantum gravitational effects ?",
    "if such a set of reliable quantum - gravity - corrected equations exist , then the exploration of phenomenological implications would become much simpler numerically , within the approximations and caveats underlying these equations .",
    "note however that , while physics obtained from such an effective spacetime description can provide important insights on the underlying quantum geometry , it is imperative to rigorously confirm the implications using full quantum dynamics in lqc where ever possible .",
    "it turns out that for states which satisfy certain semi - classicality requirements and lead to a universe which is macroscopic at late times , an effective continuum spacetime description of the loop quantum dynamics can indeed be derived using a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it provides an effective hamiltonian from which a modified friedman equation can be obtained .",
    "the result is an effective dynamical trajectory which turns out to be in an excellent agreement with the quantum dynamics for the sharply peaked states @xcite . in the following we",
    "briefly summarize the underlying method of deriving the effective dynamics following the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , obtain the modified friedmann equation for the massless scalar field model , and discuss its main features .",
    "various phenomenological implications of this modified friedmann dynamics have been extensively discussed in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , a couple of which will be discussed briefly in sec .",
    "3 .    in the geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite ,",
    "one treats the space of quantum states as an infinite dimensional phase space @xmath105 . the symplectic form ( @xmath106 ) on the phase space",
    "is given by the imaginary part of the hermitian inner product on the hilbert space .",
    "the real part of the inner product determines a riemannian metric on @xmath105 .",
    "one then seeks a relation between the quantum phase space @xmath105 with symplectic structure @xmath106 and the classical phase space @xmath107 with symplectic structure @xmath108 .",
    "the relation is given by an embedding of the finite dimensional classical phase space onto @xmath109 .",

    "the natural strategy , namely the projection of the natural liouville measure to the reduced , or gauge fixed space of solutions , produces ambiguous results it turns out , as pointed out in @xcite , that this fact is the origin of disparate results in the literature @xcite .",

    "it turns out that in general , unless one considers matter which has an equation of state , given by the ratio of the pressure and the energy density , to be greater than or equal to unity , the approach to the singularity is dictated by the anisotropic shear . in more general situations , such as in the bianchi - ix models where the presence of spatial curvature leads to even richer dynamics , the approach to the singularity is oscillatory in the kasner exponents and leads to the mixmaster behavior @xcite .",

    "this is justified because curvature invariants are well below the planck scale at all times during and after inflation , and hence quantum effects of the gravitational background are expected to be negligible .",

    "now , because the theory of tensor and scalar test fields propagating in @xmath275 has been written as a qft in curved spacetime @xmath287 , we can import the well - known theoretical machinery developed in that context and construct a fock - type quantization of the test fields . then",

    "this state is then evolved until the end of inflation and relevant quantities for observations , e.g.  the power spectra of tensor and scalar perturbations , are computed .",
    "the choice of the vacuum , however , rests on the implicit assumption that the evolution of the universe _ before _ inflation is unimportant in what the tensor and scalar modes respect ; otherwise tensor and scalar modes would reach the onset of inflation in an excited state relative to the inflationary vacuum . but to show whether this is a reasonable assumption one needs a model for the pre - inflationary universe .",
    "our strategy is to use lqc for this purpose , and _ compute _ , rather than postulate , the state of inhomogeneous perturbations at the onset of the slow - roll phase . in the resulting picture",
    "the universe contracts for an infinite amount of time , bounces at the planck scale , and then inflation starts at some time after the bounce after the bounce , and lasts for a similar interval of time .",
    "however , the universe only expands for around fifteen e - folds from the bounce to the onset of inflation , while it expands for more than 60 e - folds during inflation . on the contrary , while the spacetime scalar curvature during inflation is almost constant , in decreases about eleven orders of magnitude from the bounce to the onset of slow - roll .",
    "these numbers are obtained using initial conditions that lead to interesting observable effects in the cmb , and they can vary for other choices . ]",
    "the strategy will then be to start with vacuum initial conditions for tensor and scalar modes at early times , possibly prior to the bounce , evolve them using the lqc equations , and show that the resulting state at the onset of inflation coincides with the bunch - davies vacuum to a good approximation .",
    "if the initial state can be specified in a compelling fashion and if it does not evolve to a state that is sufficiently close to the bunch - davies vacuum at the onset of inflation , the viability of the framework would be jeopardized .",
    "if , on the other hand , the evolved state turns out to be close to the bunch - davies vacuum but with appreciable deviations , there would be new observable effects .",
    "therefore , the effect of lqc in observable quantities that we are looking for does _ not _ come from quantum gravity corrections generated _ during inflation_. there , the energy density and curvature of the universe are around eleven orders of magnitude below the planck scale , and quantum gravity corrections are suppressed by a similar factor . on the contrary ,",
    "the effects we are looking for are generated _ before _ inflation , when quantum gravity effects dominate .",
    "the important fact is that scalar and tensor perturbations keep memory of these effects @xcite which then can be imprinted in the cmb temperature anisotropies  if the amount of inflationary expansion is not much larger than 70 e - folds for these corrections not to be red - shifted to super - horizon scales .",

    "( i ) chose an inflationary potential @xmath235 . although it would be desirable to derive the potential from first principles , at the present time there is no compelling candidate within lqc .",
    "one could expected though that @xmath235 originates from a theory of particle physics , rather than from lqc which is a purely gravitational theory  although there also exist the exciting possibility that the inflaton field and its potential have a purely gravitational origin @xcite .",
    "therefore , the strategy so far in lqc has the same as in standard inflation , namely to use different phenomenologically viable potentials and contrast the results with observations .",
    "two choices have been explored in great detail in lqc : the quadratic and the so - called starobinsky potential @xcite : ( ) = m^2 ^ 2 ( ) = ( 1-(- ) ) ^2 the free parameter @xmath293 can be fixed by cmb observations although , as analyzed in detail in @xcite , in lqc there is some extra freedom .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that lqc effects have a purely quantum gravity origin and are largely independent of the choice of potential .",
    "therefore , predictions obtained from different choices of @xmath235 are all quite similar .",
    "+ ( ii ) quantum state for the flrw geometry @xmath292 . as discussed at the beginning of section [ qftqst ] , the states @xmath294 of interest differ from the ones described in section [ sec2 ] in that now the dynamics contains an inflationary potential @xmath235 . but detailed analysis @xcite have showed that lqc effects can be imprinted in the cmb only if the contribution from the potential @xmath235 is subdominant around the bounce time , as compared to the kinetic energy of @xmath5 .",
    "this is because potential dominated bounces lead to very long inflationary phases , and lqc effects will then be red - shifted to super - hubble scales .",
    "but even if the potential is subdominant around the bounce time , it gains relevance later in the evolution , and eventually dominates during inflation .",
    "however , it turns out that the potential dominated regime occurs well after the quantum gravity era , at a time when the energy density and curvature invariants are all well below the planck scale , and general relativity becomes an excellent approximation .",
    "therefore , the regime of physical interest for investigations of lqc phenomenology is such that the potential @xmath235 can be treated as a perturbation during the quantum gravity era .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relative effect of the potential in observable quantities under this circumstances is several order of magnitude below observational sensitivity . therefore , one can choose to simply ignore the potential in the quantum gravity era without affecting the accuracy of observational predictions .",
    "in this situation one is led to work with the states described in section [ sec2 ] .    among all the states for the homogeneous and isotropic gravitational field described in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", the simplest choice is to work with states @xmath295 that have very small quantum dispersions in volume @xmath291 around the bounce time .",
    "these states remain  sharply peaked \" during the entire evolution .",
    "more importantly , the resulting geometry can be accurately described by the effective metric presented in section ( [ sec.eff ] ) . for these states",
    "the energy density at the time of the bounce saturates the supremum in the entire physical hilbert space , @xmath296 .",
    "the only freedom in @xmath295 is then the way this energy density is divided between potential and kinetic energy of the inflation field at the bounce .",
    "different choices produce solutions that accumulate different amount of expansion between the bounce and the end of inflation , @xmath297 ; therefore , the freedom can be parameterized by the value of @xmath298 .",
    "one can also choose states @xmath92 which have large dispersion in @xmath291 , and therefore are not sharply peaked in any of the variables .",
    "the computation of the scalar power spectrum is numerically more challenging in this case , and has been recently performed in @xcite for states containing relative quantum dispersion in @xmath291 as large as @xmath299 in the planck epoch .",
    "the main lessons from this analysis are : i ) observational quantities _ are _ sensitive to the quantum dispersion in @xmath295 ; ii ) however , the effects are quite simple and , within observational error bars , predicted observable quantities can not distinguish between a widely spread state which produces a certain amount of expansion @xmath298 , and a sharply peaked states with a slightly different valued of @xmath298 ( see @xcite for details ) . therefore",
    ", if one is only interested in observational predictions , there is no loss of generality in restricting to sharply peaked states , as long as different value of @xmath298 are considered .",
    "this will be the strategy that we will follow in the rest of this section .",
    "+ ( iii ) quantum state for tensor and scalar modes .",
    "the specification of the initial state for inhomogeneous perturbations is an important question .",
    "two main strategies have been followed in the lqc - literature : the state is specified by choosing vacuum initial conditions at @xcite or before the bounce @xcite .",
    "it could seems at first that the far past is the natural place to set up initial data for perturbations .",
    "one can not disregard , however , the possibility that quantum gravity effects make the pre - bounce evolution unimportant . note that in presence of an inflationary phase the radius of the observable universe is of the order of 10 planck lengths at the time of the bounce . at these scales",
    "quantum gravity effects are very efficient , and there are indication that they could produce a diluting effect that makes scalar and tensor modes to forget about features acquired in the contracting phase .",
    "this is an interesting possibility , and in the absence of conclusive arguments the best strategy is to keep working with the two options and contrast their predictions with observations .    but even after making a choice between these two possibilities , one still has to face the inherent ambiguity in the definition of vacuum in quantum field theory in an expanding universe .",
    "if all wavelengths of interest are much smaller that the curvature radius , the adiabatic approach provides a useful criteria to reduce the ambiguity ; if we are not in this situation , other arguments are needed .",
    "different proposals for initial vacuum have been used in lqc . in @xcite , in a more general context , a covariant criterion was introduced to specify the notion of vacuum at a given time , by demanding that the expectation value of the adiabatically renormalized energy - momentum tensor vanishes at that time . in many situations of practical interest",

    "a natural question is then whether the lqc bounce preceding inflation provides a suitable mechanism to quantitatively account for the observed anomalies .",

    "furthermore , this mechanism also offers the possibility to account for the power suppression , since a _ monopolar _",
    "modulation appears , in addition to the dipole , at large angular scales , which could reverse the enhancement of power shown in figure [ spectrum ] .",
    "the analysis in @xcite included the non - gaussianity generated during inflation , but a contribution to the three - point function from the bounce is also expected .",

    "they are related to the choice of initial state for scalar perturbation at the time of the bounce mentioned above in this section .",

    "the new framework has become a fertile arena to obtain new mechanisms that could explain some of the anomalous features observed in the cmb , which indicate that physics beyond inflation is required to understand the large scale correlations in the cmb @xcite .    since lqc is a quantization of classical spacetimes with symmetries that are appropriate to cosmology , the theoretical framework shares the limitations of the symmetry reduced quantization strategy .",

    "within lqc itself , the concern was initially alleviated by checking that models with larger complexity , such as anisotropic bianchi i model , correctly reproduced the flrw quantization previously obtained , when the anisotropies are ` frozen ' at the quantum level .",
    "this test is even more remarkable when applied to models that have infinitely many degrees of freedom to begin with , as it is the case of the gowdy model .",
    "more generally , there are interesting recent results on establishing a connection between lqc and lqg @xcite .",
    "these include _ quantum - reduced _ loop quantum gravity @xcite , where the main idea is to capture symmetry reduction at the quantum level in lqg and then pass to the cosmological sector , and group field theory cosmology @xcite .",
    "promising results have been obtained in these approaches . as examples , improved dynamics as the one used in isotropic lqc has been found in quantum - reduced loop quantum gravity @xcite , and evidence of lqc like evolution and bounce have been reported in group field theory cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is rather encouraging that results from different directions seem to yield a consistent picture of the planck scale physics as has been extensively found in lqc    another important ingredient in lqc is the process of de - parameterization . in the absence of a fundamental time variable in quantum gravity , in lqc",
    "one follows a relational - time approach in which one of the dynamical variables plays the role of time , and one studies the evolution of other degrees of freedom with respect to it . as explained in section [ sec2 ] , in most of the lqc literature one",
    "uses a massless scalar field as time variable .",
    "an important question is how the physical results depend on the variable chosen as a time , i.e. if quantum theories constructed from different relational times are unitarily related .",
    "this is an age old question in quantum cosmology , but so far has not been systematically addressed .",
    "it is worth commenting on some of the directions where significant progress has been made in lqc , in contrast to the earlier works in quantum cosmology . the first one deals with a rigorous treatment of fundamental questions in quantum cosmology about the probability of events  such as the probability for encountering a singularity or a bounce .",
    "these are hard questions whose answers had been elusive due to the lack of sufficient control over the physical hilbert space structure , including properties of observables and a notion of time to define histories .",
    "thanks to the quantization of isotropic and homogeneous spacetimes using a scalar field @xmath5 as a clock , a consistent histories formulation can be completed both in the wheeler - dewitt theory and lqc @xcite .",
    "a covariant generalization of these results has also been pursued @xcite . using exactly soluble model of slqc computation of class operators , decoherence functional and probability amplitudes can be performed .",
    "it turns out that in the wheeler - dewitt theory the probability for bounce turns out to be zero even if one considers an arbitrary superposition of expanding and contracting states .",
    "the probability of bounce turns out to be unity in lqc .",
    "these developments show that not only lqc has been successful in overcoming problem of singularities which plague wheeler - dewitt theory , it has also established an analytical structure which has been used to answer foundational questions both in lqc and the wheeler - dewitt theory .    the second direction where developments in lqc are expected to have an impact beyond lqg are in the development of sophisticated numerical algorithms to understand the evolution in deep planck regime for a wide variety of initial states , including with very large spreads @xcite .",
    "some of these techniques have been exported from traditional numerical relativity ideas which are modified and applied in the quantum geometric setting . using high performance computing",
    ", these methods promise to yield a detailed picture of the physics of the planck scale .",
    "these techniques can be replicated in a straightforward way for other quantum gravity approaches .",
    "more importantly they provide a platform to understand the structure of quantum spacetime analogous to the numerical works in classical gravity @xcite",
    ". a deeper understanding of how quantum gravitational effects modify the bkl conjecture and change our understanding of approach to singularity in the classical theory is a promising arena .",
    "interesting results in this direction have started appearing , including on singularity resolution in bianchi models @xcite and quantum kasner transitions across bounces and selection rules on possible structures near the to be classical singularities @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that sometimes the limitations of lqc have been used to shed doubts on its results . these arguments , mainly articulated by the authors of @xcite , claim that a fully covariant approach with validity beyond symmetry reduced scenarios produces physical results inequivalent to those obtained from lqc .",
    "in particular , it is argued that , in presence of inhomogeneities , there is an unavoidable change of signature , from lorentzian to euclidean , in an effective theory .",
    "the authors of this chapter disagree with the conclusions reached in @xcite and subsequent papers along these lines .",
    "it our view , although the conceptual points raised by those authors are indeed interesting , their analysis relies in a series of assumptions and approximations that make their results far from being conclusive .",
    "furthermore , recent results on the validity of the effective theories show that care must be taken in generalizing certain conclusions from the effective description to the full quantum theory @xcite .",
