    "type ia supernovae ( snia ) are exceptionally useful distance indicators in cosmology and have been instrumental in the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "their apparent magnitudes must be `` standardized '' by correcting for empirical correlations between observable properties and intrinsic magnitude in order to reduce residual scatter sufficiently to measure cosmological parameters .    to date , cosmological parameter constraints from snia",
    "have been derived from optical lightcurve data .",
    "there are however clear indications that near infra - red ( nir ) data improve precision and accuracy further  @xcite . at nir wavelengths ( 900 nm @xmath6 2000 nm ) snia exhibit more uniform brightness , without the need for empirical standardization @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the peak luminosity in these studies can be as low as 0.1 mag .",
    "furthermore , nir light is less affected by extinction due to dust , which makes nir data less prone to pernicious dust - related systematics .",
    "distances in the nir can be measured to better than 6@xmath7 precision , making this wavelength region an exciting prospect for snia cosmology @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve morphology in the nir is markedly different from that in the optical , showing a pronounced second maximum in @xmath8 filters for `` normal '' snia @xcite .",
    "this rebrightening offers interesting clues into the physics of the explosion .",
    "the timing of the second maximum ( @xmath1 , measured as the time between @xmath9-band maximum light and the second maximum in a given nir filter ) in the @xmath10 filters is strongly correlated with the optical decline rate of snia ( measured by the @xmath11 parameter ) as shown in and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on radiative transfer calculations of synthetic lightcurves , predicted that @xmath1 is a function of the @xmath12nimass produced by the snia .",
    "indeed , @xcite found a strong correlation between the peak bolometric luminosity ( and therefore , @xmath12nimass , see * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath1 for a sample of snia with low - extinction from host galaxy dust .",
    "they demonstrate that this parameter can be used to infer the @xmath12nimass for snia .",
    "there are many reasons why @xmath1 is a potentially useful quantity for snia cosmology .",
    "firstly , since @xmath1 is a timing ( and not a flux ) estimate , it is unaffected by host galaxy reddening , which is not the case for optical decline rate parameters , e.g. @xmath13 and @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) .",
    "secondly , the rebrightening in the nir is due to an ionization transition of fe - group elements from doubly to singly ionized atoms at a transition temperature @xmath14 7000 k  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the time at which this transition occurs is driven by the amount of heating from @xmath12ni  produced by the explosion . since @xmath12ni  is the primary energy source for the peak brightness of the snia  @xcite , @xmath1 would be expected to correlate strongly with the peak magnitude of the snia and hence be an effective parameter for standardization .",
    "thirdly , the rebrightening in the nir is an exclusive feature of snia , not observed in any other type of sn .",
    "this makes the second maximum a useful indicator to distinguish snia from other types of sne in absence of spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "therefore , observing the nir second maximum could become critical for photometric classification of snia in future sn surveys . given that such data should become available with future facilities e.g .",
    "euclid ( expected launch 2019 ) , jwst ( expected 2018 ) , wfirst ( expected launch @xmath14 2020 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review) studying the standardization properties of @xmath1 can provide an alternative and more robust route to snia cosmology at no additional observational cost .",
    "furthermore , the time - delay between the optical peak brightness and nir rebrightening means that nir observations can be scheduled without the need for prompt alerts required to sample densely the optical lightcurve near its peak , which is necessary for an accurate estimate of @xmath11 .    the aim of this work is to compare the residual scatter in magnitudes after empirical standardization for a sample of nearby snia using the traditional stretch parameter ( @xmath13 ) versus what can be obtained when using @xmath1 instead ( or in addition ) .",
    "we address the question of whether the nir rebrightening time can be used to reduce the residual scatter in the peak luminosity of snia .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec - meth ]",
    "we describe the data set we use and present the bayesian methodology for our analysis including a description of the parameters of interest .",
    "we present the results of applying our method to this low-@xmath0 snia data set in section  [ sec - res ] and conclude in section  [ sec - conc ] .",
    "we have compiled a sample of 22 snia , in the redshift range @xmath15 , all with well - sampled optical and nir photometry .",
    "the source of nir snia photometry is the carnegie supernova project ( csp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the low-@xmath0 csp provides a sample of snia with optical and nir light curves in a homogeneous and well - defined photometric system ( the vega magnitude system ) and thus forms an ideal base for the evaluation of light curve properties .",
    "the salt2 fit parameters , i.e. peak b - band magnitude @xmath16 , lightcurve stretch correction @xmath13 , and colour correction @xmath17 ,   are taken from the analysis in  @xcite .",
    "the total number of snia with nir @xmath1 estimates is larger than presented here , however , we only use the subset analysed as part of the low-@xmath0 anchor in @xcite .",
    "the nir rebrightening time , @xmath1 , in the @xmath18-band , is evaluated as described in @xcite and subsequently re - centered to the sample mean value , @xmath19 days .      in order to determine the standardization parameters and residual dispersion in the snia magnitudes",
    ", we use the bayesian hierarchical method _ bahamas _  @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced bayesian hierarchical modeling to the problem of cosmological parameter extraction from salt2 fits .",
    "the key feature is the hierarchical treatment of sources of uncertainty , comprising of both measurement errors and population variability .",
    "each observed covariate ( for example @xmath20 , the observed apparent magnitude of the @xmath21-th snia ) is assumed to have an underlying true ( latent ) value ( for example @xmath22 , the real apparent magnitude of the @xmath21-th snia ) that is unobserved .",
    "linear regression is then applied to the true value of the covariate , which itself is drawn probabilistically from a distribution describing the population of snia . finally , latent values are marginalized from the posterior distribution . @xcite",
    "further developed this bayesian approach to include additional ( or alternative ) covariates for the standardization of snia , and to provide explicit sampling of the latent variables .",
    "we refer to @xcite for full details about the hierarchical model and the sampling methods ( see also @xcite for a similar model but applied under a frequentist framework ; @xcite for a different implementation of a similar hierarchical bayesian model , and @xcite for an analysis using bayesian graphs ) .",
    "another feature that distinguishes this bayesian procedure from the standard @xmath23 approach is the treatment of the absolute magnitude of snia s . rather than assuming that all snia s have the same intrinsic magnitude ( and then inflate the observational errors to obtain @xmath24dof = 1 , as in the standard approach ) , each snia is assigned its own absolute magnitude , @xmath25 .",
    "these are assumed to follow an underlying gaussian distribution ( denoted by @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 , whose mean , @xmath28 , and residual dispersion , @xmath29 , are determined from the data .",
    "similarly , the other latent parameters are modeled hierarchically as @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. , the aforementioned distributions describing the population of snia , where the means and standard deviations of the distributions are bayesianly determined from the data .",
    "this hierarchical structure has an advantage of `` borrowing strength '' , in particular , when estimating the intrinsic ( and unaccounted for ) scatter of snia ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "@xcite also showed that this method reduces the mean squared error of the parameter estimators when compared to the standard approach . in this work ,",
    "we extend _ bahamas _  to include @xmath1 as an additional linear covariate ( or as an alternative to @xmath5 ) .    the generalized phillips corrections , including any number of ( linear )",
    "covariates can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distance modulus at the observed redshift @xmath35 for cosmological parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a vector of covariates , and @xmath38 is the vector of regression coefficients . in the standard salt2 analysis @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the slope of the stretch correction parameter and @xmath42 is the slope of the colour correction parameter .",
    "( everywhere , hats denote measured quantities . ) in this analysis we consider 5 cases :    * @xmath43 and @xmath44 * @xmath45 and @xmath46 * @xmath39 and @xmath40 * @xmath47 and @xmath48 * @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,    where @xmath51 is the nir rebrightening parameter , giving the ( negative of the ) slope of the linear relationship between @xmath1 and intrinsic magnitude .",

    "we fix the cosmology since this parameters are unconstrained by low redshift snia data alone .",
    "the priors for the other parameters in our model are given in table [ table : main_params ] .",
    "a significant fraction of the residual dispersion in low-@xmath0 snia is due to peculiar velocities , since these objects are not fully in the hubble flow . to account for the variance due to peculiar velocities",
    ", we follow a procedure similar to @xcite .",
    "specifically , we add a term , @xmath68 , to the apparent magnitude error ; @xmath69 depends on the peculiar velocities uncertainty , @xmath70 , and redshift measurement error , @xmath71 , as @xmath72.\\ ] ] following @xcite , we set @xmath73 = @xmath74km / s .",
    "to ensure the robustness of the posterior distribution , we vary the choice of prior distribution for the residual intrinsic dispersion , @xmath75 , using ( 0.1,0.1 ) , ( 0.03,0.03 ) , ( 0.003,0.003 ) and @xmath76 ; @xmath77 denotes a random variable whose reciprocal follows a gamma distribution , its probability density is given by @xmath78 . ] with mode equal to @xmath79 .",
    "while the posteriors for all other parameters are fairly independent of the choice of prior distribution for @xmath75 , the posterior distribution of @xmath75 is sensitive to this choice .",
    "( this is not unexpected given the small number of snia in our sample . )",
    "thus we do not use the posterior distribution of @xmath75 to quantify and compare the residual scatter for different models .",
    "instead , we quantify the residual scatter in the hubble diagram with the hubble residual between the observed distance modulus , @xmath80 , and the model distance modulus , @xmath81 , for snia @xmath21 , that is , @xmath82    we emphasize that @xmath83 is a function of the unknown parameters @xmath28 and @xmath38 . thus in a bayesian analysis @xmath83 itself has a posterior distribution .",
    "we then calculate the posterior distribution of the sample standard deviation of the @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "because @xmath83 is a function of the unknown parameters @xmath28 and @xmath38 , @xmath87 is also a function of @xmath28 and @xmath38 and itself has a posterior distribution .",
    "thus we calculate the posterior distribution of @xmath87 .",
    "we find that @xmath87 is independent of the prior choice ( of @xmath75 ) and quantifies the residual scatter in the hubble diagram well .",
    "we use @xmath87 to compare the performance of the five choices of covariates enumerated in the five cases mentioned previously .    in order to cross - check our numerical results ,",
    "we obtain samples from the joint posterior distribution of the parameters of interest using both a gibbs sampler and a metropolis - hastings algorithm , obtaining identical results up to monte carlo noise .",
    "( details on the sampling algorithms can be found in @xcite . )",
    "we marginalize out the latent variables ( via monte carlo for the gibbs sampler and analytically for the metropolis - hastings algorithm ) and present marginal posterior distributions for the parameters of interest , including @xmath87 .",
    "table  [ table : posterior ] presents the posterior mean and standard deviation of the regression coefficients , as well as of @xmath88 for each of the five cases .",
    "when @xmath1 is used as the sole covariate , the ( negative of the ) slope of the linear relationship with intrinsic magnitude , @xmath51 , shows a 3.4@xmath89 deviation from zero .",
    "when colour is added as an additional covariate , the significance of the @xmath1 coefficient increases to @xmath90 . when all three covariates are used together , the ( absolute ) values of both the rebrightening time and the stretch correction slopes",
    "reduce , suggesting that ( as expected ) @xmath1 and @xmath5 encode similar standardization information .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     since the posterior distributions of @xmath87 are highly skewed , table  [ table : sdmu ] reports their 5th , 25th , 50th , 75th , and 95th percentiles , rather than their means and the standard deviations . also shown are @xmath2 posterior intervals for each distribution ; we choose the shortest @xmath91 intervals which in this case extend from the minimum to the 68th percentile of each distribution .",
    "the marginal posterior distributions of @xmath87 are displayed in figure [ fig : s_deltamu ] for all 5 cases considered .",
    "based on the residual scatter in the hubble diagram , @xmath87 , in the absence of colour correction , @xmath1 alone is a better standardization quantity than stretch : the ( shortest ) @xmath2 posterior interval is @xmath3 for the former , while it is @xmath4 for the latter .",
    "this can further be seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig : deltamu ] . on average ,",
    "@xmath1 ( red ) leads to smaller hubble residuals than @xmath5 ( blue ) .",
    "however , when the colour correction is added to the regression , nir rebrightening time and stretch lead to similar residual scatter , with rebrightening time and colour ( @xmath2 posterior interval is @xmath92 ) performing slightly better than stretch and colour ( @xmath2 posterior interval is @xmath93 ) , which is also shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : deltamu ] .",
    "when using all three covariates together , we observe no further reduction in the residual scatter .",
    "we conclude that @xmath1 can be effectively used as an alternative covariate to @xmath5 for the standardization of snia , but does not lead to further reduction in the residuals scatter in the hubble diagram once both stretch and colour corrections have been included as covariates .",
    "we also consider the case when colour is the only covariate , and find that the posterior distribution of @xmath87 is comparable to the case when @xmath1 is the only covariate .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : s_deltamu ] , the posterior distributions of @xmath87 in all five cases are skewed with long tails for larger values and sharp lower bounds .",
    "the sharp lower bound is a feature of the likelihood function , rather than an artifact of the analysis , or a prior - dependent feature . in order to show this ,",
    "for each of the 5 cases considered , we compute the maximum likelihood value of @xmath87 by optimizing @xmath94 .",
    "we find that in all five cases , the maximum likelihood value of @xmath87 coincides with the lower bound of its posterior distribution . with a gaussian likelihood , the maximum likelihood value of the residual variance is formed by minimizing the sum of squared residuals over the possible values of the regression coefficients .",
    "this means that there are _ no values _ of @xmath94 that produce values of @xmath87 less than the lower bounds in each of the five posterior distributions . as defined in equation",
    ", @xmath87 is a function of @xmath28 and @xmath38 and its posterior distribution is determined by theirs .",
    "we demonstrated on a low-@xmath0 snia sample that the waiting time for nir rebrightening , @xmath1 , is significantly better at calibrating the peak magnitude of snia when compared with stretch alone .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between @xmath1 , @xmath11 and the time of maximum @xmath95 colour ( denoted by @xmath96 ) .",
    "they inferred that the diversity in @xmath1 values of snia is driven by different masses of @xmath12niproduced in the explosion .",
    "as a follow - up , @xcite identified a strong correlation between the peak bolometric luminosity ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath1 for a sample of snia with well - measured nir data . since the luminosity at peak corresponds to the instantaneous energy deposition rate from @xmath12nidecay , the authors used the correlation between @xmath97  and @xmath1 and arnett s rule to infer a @xmath12nimass distribution .",
    "the correlation between @xmath12nimass and @xmath1 is stronger than that between @xmath12nimass and optical decline rate parameters noted in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore adopting @xmath1 as a standardization parameter can lead to a smaller residual dispersion because @xmath1 is more strongly correlated to the physical driver of the luminosity , thus explaining our findings .",
    "future sn surveys are designed to provide multi - band data for a large sample of snia .",
    "space - based observatories like euclid and wfirst will be equipped with nir filters , which will allow us to observe snia in the @xmath98 bands out to high-@xmath0 .",
    "with such a configuration , we can expect measurements of @xmath1 for snia at @xmath0 > 0.5 , with the view of using this quantity as an alternative standardization parameter to the optical decline rate . proposed a sn survey with lsst and the euclid satellite out to z @xmath14 1.5 . with their survey parameters ,",
    "they expect a total of @xmath14 1700 sne in the redshift range 0.75 < z < 1.5 , a sizeable sample to test our standardization procedure at high-@xmath0 .",
    "this would lead to a better understanding of the physical parameters underlying the standardization procedure ( e.g. , @xmath12ni mass ) , to tests of the validity of the empirical stretch correction and to a reduction of the systematic error budget in snia cosmology .    _",
