    "since their discovery ( heger 1922 ) , the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) have been a persistent spectroscopic enigma  representing unidentified ingredients in the physics and chemistry of the interstellar medium .",

    ". some characteristics of the carriers may be inferred , however , from the observed absorption - line profiles .",
    "high - resolution , high - s / n spectra have revealed substructure in the profiles of a number of the dibs ( sarre et al . 1995 ; kreowski & schmidt 1997 ; galazutdinov et al . 2008 ) . that substructure was initially attributed to either rotational structure ( ehrenfreund & foing 1996 ) or isotopic substitution ( webster 1996 ) in large , carbon - based carrier molecules in the gas phase  which could contain a non - negligible fraction of the available carbon .",
    "variations in the separations and relative strengths of the subcomponents  presumably reflecting differences in local environmental conditions  may be seen for a number of the dibs ( cami et al .",
    "2004 ; galazutdinov et al .",
    "2008 ) . while the variations in subcomponent separation seem to rule out isotopic substitution , modelling of the substructures as rotational contours",

    "there are some indications of etr for the three dibs on the right of fig .  3 also ,",
    "but we have not been able to explain them quantitatively by the mechanism we consider in this paper .",
    "they may be due to vibrational hot bands , as discussed in section 5.3 . in any case , the qualitative difference between the variations of the three dibs on the left and those on the right of fig .",
    "3 is obvious .",
    "the broad deep absorption observed for 9 sgr near @xmath136379.3 is a stellar feature and should be ignored .",
    "we interpret the huge etr observed for the three dibs on the left in fig .  3 as reflecting the population of many high @xmath4 levels of the large polar carriers of the dibs , due to radiative pumping by dust emission .",
    "while this effect is relatively minor for ch@xmath3 and ch in which only the lowest excited levels are affected , it can be huge for the dibs since a great many high @xmath4 rotational levels are affected because of the low rotational constants of dib carriers . for such small rotational constants , the @xmath67(@xmath4 ) and @xmath19(@xmath4 ) lines are nearly symmetric and linearly spaced by @xmath7  @xmath682@xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is a rotational constant ) at low @xmath4 and the @xmath21(@xmath4 ) lines pile up at the center of the band . as @xmath4 increases , however , the negative quadratic term ( @xmath71)@xmath72 ( see next section ) takes over and causes an @xmath19-branch band - head and the etr .",
    "the rotational constant in the excited state @xmath73 is almost always smaller than that in the ground state @xmath70 since an electronic excitation tends to weaken chemical bonds , which makes the molecule larger and the moment of inertia higher .",
    "the pronounced etrs observed for the three dibs , @xmath135780.5 , @xmath135797.1 , and @xmath136613.6 indicate that their carriers are polar molecules with dipole moments .",
    "the absence of etr for @xmath135849.8 , @xmath136196.0 , and @xmath136379.3 suggests that either the carriers of those dibs are non - polar or they are large polar molecules with very small @xmath71 .",
    "either way , the qualitative difference between the variations of @xmath136613.6 and @xmath136196.0 eliminates the possibility that they are due to the same molecule , in spite of their near perfect correlation ( mccall et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the distribution of molecules in rotational levels is determined as a result of their interaction with the environment through radiation and collision .",
    "they are influenced by the radiative temperature @xmath11 of planck s radiation formula ( planck 1901 ) and the kinetic temperature @xmath74 of maxwell s velocity distribution ( maxwell 1860 ) . if @xmath11  =  @xmath74 , molecules are in equilibrium , following the thermal boltzmann distribution ( boltzmann 1871 ) @xmath27  =  @xmath11  =  @xmath74 . in interstellar space , the two temperatures are generally different , so a non - thermal molecular distribution is more the rule than the exception .",
    "very approximate calculations for simple molecules ( e.g. for h@xmath75 , by oka & epp 2004 ) have been reported , but a calculation for general molecules is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we consider the simplest case of linear molecules , based on an approximate treatment of collisions , in order just to see if we can explain the pronounced etr using realistic molecular parameters .",
    "long linear molecules , more specifically acetylenic carbon chain molecules , have been proposed as candidates for carriers of dibs ( douglas 1977 ; maier et al .",
    "many such molecules are known to have large dipole moments , e. g. , 3.6  debye for hc@xmath76n ( westenberg & wilson ) , 5.6  debye for hc@xmath77n ( broten et al .",
    "1978 ) and 11.9  debye for c@xmath78h@xmath79 ( brnken et al . 2007 ) , and their rotational distributions are sensitive to @xmath11 .",
    "the result of this treatment is also applicable ( approximately ) to nearly linear molecules with a dipole moment along the linear axis , such as cumulene carbon chains h@xmath62c@xmath80",
    "( @xmath81  3 ) , which have also been considered as carriers of dibs ( mccarthy et al .",
    "calculations for general molecules are more complicated because of the three ( instead of one ) rotational constants , quantum numbers , and components of dipole moments , and the lack of spectroscopic and collisional data .",
    "we will keep that as a future project .",
    "nevertheless , the results from our simple case give insight for other more complicated molecules as well .",
    "the first excited levels of light molecules like ch@xmath3 and ch ( 40.1  k and 25.6  k above the ground level , respectively ) have very short lifetimes for spontaneous emission and their rotational distributions are determined solely by @xmath11 . for the large molecules which cause dibs , the rotational constants are smaller by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , their distributions are governed by collisions ( with @xmath74 ) for low @xmath4 rotational levels . as @xmath4 increases ,",
    "the rate of spontaneous emission increases rapidly ( @xmath82 ) , making radiative effects competitive with collisional effects until the radiative effects ( with @xmath11 ) take over and dominate at high @xmath4 levels .",
    "for example , for hc@xmath83n ( avery et al .",
    "1976 ) with rotational constant 1331.3313  mhz and dipole moment 4.33  debye , the collisional effects dominate for @xmath4  =  1 , become comparable to the radiative effects at @xmath84 , and the radiative effects dominate for high @xmath4 levels . in the following ,",
    "this subtle balance between radiative and collisional effects is considered .",
    "the radiative effects are accurately calculable while the collisional effects are treated approximately . in treating the latter",
    ", we use the principle of detailed balancing ( boltzmann 1872 ) as the guiding principle , as in oka & epp ( 2004 ) .      in the laboratory where the number density is high , spontaneous emission between rotational levels ,",
    "@xmath85 is many orders of magnitude slower than collisional processes and is negligible .",
    "then the detailed balancing between @xmath4 and @xmath4  -  1 levels are expressed as ,    @xmath86    ,    where @xmath87 is the number density of molecules with rotational quantum number @xmath4 , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are rates for collision - induced rotational transitions ( oka 1973 ) @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we follow the spectroscopists convention , in which the quantum states of higher energy are on the left and exothermic and endothermic processes are expressed by arrows pointing to the right and left , respectively .",
    "the rates satisfy the principle of detailed balancing , that is ,    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the number density in thermal equilibrium , @xmath94 is the degeneracy of the level , and @xmath95 is the rotational energy of the molecule in the @xmath4 level ( townes & schawlow 1955 ) . from eqs .",

    "when radiation is included along with collisions , the detailed balancing takes the form ,    @xmath98    where the einstein @xmath99 and @xmath70 coefficients express spontaneous emission and induced radiative effect , respectively ( einstein 1916 ) . using einstein s relations @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and planck s formula ( 1901 ) , @xmath102 , we obtain ,    @xmath103 = n(j-1)\\left[a^j\\frac{2j+1}{2j-1}\\frac{1}{e^{h\\nu / kt_r}-1}+c_{j-1}^\\uparrow \\right],\\ ] ]    instead of eq .  1 .",

    "9 and the populations @xmath87 calculated in the previous section . in order to take into account uncertainty broadening due to a short emission life time of the upper state or internal conversion by the douglas effect ( douglas 1966 ) ,",
    "spectral lines are broadened by @xmath121 .",
    "the simulated profiles are then convolved with the feros instrumental function ( assumed to be a gaussian with fwhm  =  6.25  km  s@xmath39 ) .    the most crucial molecular parameter for producing the observed etr is the difference between rotational constants @xmath122 .",
    "in order to explain the pronounced etr , we need molecules with large values of @xmath123 .",
    "the experimental values of this constant for carbon molecules ( mostly from maier s group ) are listed in table  2 .",
    "we note that for all molecules except one ( c@xmath83 ) the rotational constant decreases upon electronic excitation , as expected . the reported positive change for c@xmath83 ( motylewski et al .",
    "1999 ) is probably due to a mistake in the analysis ( j. p. maier 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "the large @xmath8 values of 4.3% , 3.4% , 5.7% , 4.9% etc .",
    "are the essence of the observed pronounced etr .",
    "a small increase on the order of 1% can not reproduce the pronounced etr unless @xmath11 is very high .",
    "this indicates that the carriers of dibs with pronounced etr are perhaps relatively small molecules .",
    "the calculated velocity profiles for @xmath135780.5 , @xmath135797.1 , and @xmath136613.6 are shown in fig .  5 , together with parameters which best mimic the observed etrs .",
    "it has been noted in our simulations that , of the seven parameters used in the analysis ( @xmath11 , @xmath74 , @xmath70 , @xmath47 , @xmath109 , @xmath8 , and @xmath124 ) , those related to collisions ( @xmath74 and @xmath109 ) are not very critical .",
    "even the values of @xmath70 and @xmath47 are not that critical .",
    "the most crucial parameters are @xmath11 , @xmath8 , and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the essence of the observations and the analysis in this paper is the prominent etr for the three dibs shown in the left column of fig .",
    "3 , in sharp contrast with the three dibs on the right .",
    "the first author has developed the above formalism based on the premise that the etrs result from a single `` local '' cloud near her 36 se .",
    "it is possible instead that the dibs toward her 36 are a composite of those local dibs and ( as seen toward 9 sgr ) foreground dibs , and that the latter need to be subtracted . in that view , the observed profiles reflect an accidental blend of dibs from two clouds : one in the foreground ( without etr ) and the other local to herschel 36 .",
    "the foreground - subtracted profiles shown ( in black ) in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "8 of paper i are difficult to understand , spectroscopically , however , as the usually observed dib cores are nearly absent . on the other hand , if the foreground absorption were significantly weaker toward herschel 36 than toward 9 sgr ( as shown in the right - hand panel of fig . 8 of paper i ) , then the subtracted profiles would appear to be more consistent with the analysis given above .",
    "that analysis and the discussion and conclusions given below are based on the premise that the beautiful and systematic etrs , which make sense spectroscopically , must be due to a single , local cloud .",
    "the above analysis has indicated that a large fractional decrease in the rotational constant @xmath8 ( @xmath7  5% ) and a high radiative temperature ( @xmath11 @xmath12  50  k ) in the environment of the dib carriers are needed to produce the observed pronounced etrs .",
    "@xmath11  = 14.6  k is not high enough to explain the etr .",
    "the width of an etr is simply proportional to @xmath8 , and high @xmath11 extends the rotational quantum number @xmath4 of the populated levels ( as seen in fig .  4 ) and thus greatly extends the etr .",
    "the requirement of such a high @xmath11 is surprising , but there seems to be no alternative , since the value of @xmath8 is limited ( table 2 ) .",
    "our calculations are only for linear molecules , but it seems that this requirement holds for other types of molecules with three rotational constants , @xmath99 , @xmath70 , and @xmath109 , as long as the etrs are ascribed to the differences between the rotational constants of the excited and ground states . other possible mechanisms , albeit not very realistic , are discussed below in sec .",
    "although our model calculations for polar linear molecules with high @xmath8 and @xmath11 give the observed pronounced etr for the three dibs as shown in fig .  5 , we can not claim that they are the carriers of the dibs .",
    "in particular , a linear molecule can not explain the triplet structure of dib @xmath136613.6 discovered by sarre et al .",
    "a perpendicular transition of a linear molecule gives a triplet structure but the central pileup of the @xmath21 branch lines should be stronger than those of the @xmath67 and @xmath19 branches by a factor of approximately 2 due to the hnl - london factors  which contradicts the observation . the claim by schultz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that @xmath136613.6 is due to a parallel band of a long chain cumulane molecule ( h@xmath62c@xmath80 ) does not work either , since the @xmath21 branch pileup is weak for such molecule .",
    "kerr et al . ( 1996 ) proposed a large planar symmetric top as the carrier of this band .",
    "such a molecule does not have a dipole moment and thus can not be the carrier of @xmath136613.6 ( which is sensitive to @xmath11 ) .",
    "in general , non - polar molecules often considered for dibs ( such as c@xmath80 , hc@xmath80h , h@xmath62c@xmath80h@xmath62 , nc@xmath80n , etc . ) , symmetric pahs ( like pyrene , coronene , ovalene etc . ) , or c@xmath126 and their cations and anions can not be the carriers of dibs exhibiting the etr .",
    "derivatives of pahs , polar pahs such as phenanthrene , tetraphen , pentaphene or recently synthesized olympicene could be the carriers , but most of them probably do not have sufficiently large @xmath8 to produce the etr .",
    "there are no experimental data for @xmath8 for coronene , but a theoretical value @xmath8  =  0.3% ( cossart - magos & leach 1990 ) is an order of magnitude too small to produce the pronounced etr .",
    "cami et al . (",
    "2004 ) discovered small variations in the structure of @xmath136613.6 for different sight lines and interpreted them as due to variations in rotational temperature from 21  k to 25  k. we believe that the rotational temperature is much lower ( because of spontaneous emission ) , and a minute increase of @xmath11 over the 2.73 k blackbody radiation is sufficient to explain the shifts ( due to excitation of @xmath67 and @xmath19 lines of low @xmath4 ) .    a similar difficulty is encountered also for @xmath135797.1 .",
    "the high resolution spectrum of this dib shows a sharp @xmath21 branch line .",
    "our model calculation requires a large line broadening which is obviously contradictory .",
    "here we are just content to be able to produce observed huge etrs using realistic @xmath8 and @xmath11 and leave those thorny problems for future studies .",
    "we ascribe the pronounced etr to small ( @xmath7  5% ) variations in the rotational constants , but there may be two other possible interpretations .",
    "it is known that some molecules change their shape from non - linear in the ground electronic state to linear in the excited state .",
    "some examples are ch@xmath62 ( _ _ b__@xmath127",
    "@xmath1  _ _ x__@xmath128 ) , hco ( _ _ __@xmath6  @xmath1  _ _ x__@xmath129 ) and no@xmath62 ( _ _ e__@xmath130",
    "@xmath1  _ _ x__@xmath131 ) ( herzberg 1989b ) .",
    "these molecules are too small to cause dibs , but if there are larger molecules with the same property , the change in the rotational constant @xmath99 by the electronic excitation is 100% and radiative pumping may cause pronounced etr without having to assume a high @xmath11 . while we have not been able to find relevant experimental data for large molecules of this nature , it is a possibility .",
    "such electronic transitions , however , tend to have many vibronic satellites with high franck - condon factors which are not seen for @xmath135780.5 , @xmath135797.1 , and @xmath136613.6 .",
    "alternatively , we may interpret the etr as a result of the excitation of low frequency vibrational modes ( rather than rotational levels in the ground state ) .",
    "the carriers then would not need to be polar molecules .",
    "the radiative effect for a vibrational excitation is typically 100 times less than that for rotational excitation , but the collisional excitations are also small and they may compete .",
    "the bending frequencies of c@xmath76 , 63.4  cm@xmath39 ( schmuttenmaer et al . 1990 ) , and of c@xmath76o@xmath62 , 18.3  cm@xmath39 ( fusina et al . 1980 ) , are too high , but there may be larger molecules with lower vibrational frequencies .",
    "such spectra , however , are likely to exhibit blue as well as red wings . also its effect will look more like the three examples on the right of fig .  3 , @xmath135849.8 , @xmath136196.0 , and @xmath136379.3 .",
    "we have interpreted the pronounced etrs observed for @xmath135780.5 , @xmath135797.1 , and @xmath136613.6 toward herschel 36 as the result of the variation of the rotational constant upon electronic excitation .",
    "our results do not lead to identification of the specific carriers of dibs , but they exclude some possibilities with various degrees of certainty .",
    "the presence or absence of the etr allows discrimination between polar and non - polar carriers .",
    "the carriers of @xmath135780.5 , @xmath135797.1 , and @xmath136613.6 , which show pronounced etr , can not be non - polar molecules .",
    "molecules like pure carbon chains ( c@xmath80 ) or symmetric hydrocarbon chains ( hc@xmath80h , h@xmath62c@xmath80h@xmath62 , nc@xmath80n , etc . ) and their cations and anions can not be the carriers of those dibs .",
    "likewise , symmetric pahs benzene , pyrene , coronene , ovalene etc . and their cations and anions ( cossart - magos & leach 1990 ; see also the many pahs discussed in sharp et al .",
    "2006 ) or c@xmath126 and their cations and anions can not be the carriers of dibs exhibiting strong etr .",
    "the carriers of dibs which show the etr ( on the left of fig .",
    "3 ) can not be the carriers of the dibs without etr ( on the right ) .",
    "in particular , the carriers of @xmath136196.0 and @xmath136613.6 can not be the same molecule , despite the near - perfect correlation of those two dibs ( mccall et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "if linear molecules are assumed ( as in section 4 ) , the number of heavy atoms is likely 36 but not much higher , since the values of @xmath8  =  @xmath132 are not high enough for heavier molecules to produce the pronounced etr ( unless the radiative temperature is extremely high ) .",
    "many linear molecules of this size have already been studied spectroscopically by maier s group , but cumulene carbene molecules @xmath133-h@xmath62c@xmath134 ( n @xmath12 3 ) may be candidates .",
    "non - linear molecules are outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the high column densities required to produce the strong dibs are problems ( oka & mccall 2011 ; liszt et al .",
    "2012 ) , but this will be a problem for any candidate molecules of this size .    the carriers of @xmath135849.8 , @xmath136196.0 , and @xmath136379.3 , which do not show the etr as observed in @xmath135780.5 , @xmath135797.1 , and @xmath136613.6 , are most likely non - polar molecules .",
    "the possibility that the carriers of those dibs exist in different location from other dibs and are not exposed to the dust emission is perhaps safely neglected . however , our simulations have not excluded the possibility that they may be due to large polar molecules with very small @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we have considered only linear molecules where the etr is created by large @xmath8  =  @xmath135 ( @xmath7  5% ) . for non - linear molecules ,",
    "there are other possibilities , such as large decreases in the differences of rotational constants @xmath136 or @xmath137 for prolate or oblate tops , respectively .",
    "either way , the relative variations of these constants are not very likely to be much higher than 5  % , except for the case mentioned in section 5.3 . in most cases , they are 10 times smaller than needed to produce the pronounced etr",
    ".      since carriers of dibs with pronounced etrs are polar molecules with modest size , they should be observable by radio astronomy . because of the low density and subthermal rotational distribution in diffuse clouds , the observation need to be by absorption ( liszt et al .",
    "2012 ) , and in relatively long wavelength region for low @xmath4 transitions .",
