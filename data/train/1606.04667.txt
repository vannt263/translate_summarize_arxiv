    "starburst ( sb ) - active galactic nucleus ( agn ) connection is generally explored in order to understand galaxy formation , structure and evolution . processes which stimulate starbursts",
    "may lead also to agn onset ( hopkins et al 2011 ) .",
    "dixon & joseph ( 2011 ) using a variety of spectroscopic diagnostics found that @xmath050% of the luminous infrared galaxies ( lirg ) in their sample shows some evidence for an agn .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath0 17 % of the sample galaxies seems dominated by emission from agn , and the remaining @xmath0 80 % have luminosities dominated by sb .",
    "@xmath050% of the sample galaxies indicates coupled agn and starburst activities suggesting that agns and starbursts commonly coexist .",
    "contini & contini ( 2007 ) investigating a sample of lirg ( @xmath510@xmath6 ) , ultra - lirg ( ulirg , @xmath510@xmath7 ) and hyper - lirg ( hlirg,@xmath5 10@xmath8 ) concluded that half of the lirg contains an agn , at least one agn is found in all the ulirg and none in the hlirg .",
    "the connection between the agn and the starburst is not direct and it is affected by a ( viscous ) time lag of gas flowing through the agn accretion disc leading to agn activity delay in star formation activity ( blank & duschl 2013 ) .",
    "agn feedback may terminate star formation in the host galaxy poor gas phase and trigger it in the rich phase ( zubovas et al .",
    "sb - agn coexistence in local galaxies has been investigated by the analysis of mid - infrared lines and of the continuum spectral energy distribution ( sed ) adopting diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. dixon & joseph 2011 ) and by the optical- uv lines and continuum sed in relatively high z galaxies by detail modelling ( contini 2015 and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the spectra from galaxies at z@xmath00.8 , presented by the ly et al ( 2015 ) deep2 survey .",
    "the observations were done by the deimos multi - object spectrograph on the keck ii telescope . the observed spectra account for the [ oiii]5007 + ( the + indicates that the 5007 and 4959 lines are summed ) , [ oiii]4363 , [ neiii ] 3869 + , [ oii]3727 + , and lines which can be used to constrain the models .",
    "the observed spectra are generally reproduced by detailed modelling .",
    "we have noticed by modelling the spectra observed from many different galaxy types ( contini 2016 and references therein ) , that in some cases , even when the [ oiii]5007+/and [ oii]3727+/line ratios are well fitted by the models , the [ oiii]4363/systematically disagree .",
    "for instance , [ oiii ] 4363/line ratios calculated by shock dominated models overpredict the data in super - luminous sn host galaxies ( contini 2016 ) .",
    "therefore , the [ oiii]4363/line ratios , when available , are useful to constrain the models . selecting the agn , sb , and/or",
    "only shock dominated models best fitting the data , the galaxy types can be distinguished .",
    "the 3 ( [ oiii]5007 + 4959/[oiii]4363 ) line ratios are favourite in the modelling process because they depend only indirectly on the o / h relative abundance .",
    "actually , o / h variations affect the cooling process in the recombination zone of the emitting clouds leading to different line spectra .",
    "we use models which account for both the photoionizing flux from a primary radiation source and shocks .",
    "shocks yield fragmentation of matter by turbulence created near the shock - front and compression of the gas downstream , leading to high densities which can trigger star formation .",
    "composite models resolved the problem regarding 3 in agn and liner ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ) spectra , which indicated relatively high temperatures ( @xmath5 10@xmath9k ) and densities ( @xmath5 10@xmath9 3 ) in the emitting gas ( contini & aldrovandi 1986 ) .",
    "moreover , comparing calculated with observed line ratios the gas motion direction can be determined , i.e. infalling towards the radiation source or ejected outwards ( fig .",
    "this is an important issue in view of the sb - agn feedback in galaxies .",

    "the data are reduced to a few significant lines , but the surveys contain hundreds of objects .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the o / h metallicity , the oxygen line ratios are generally calculated by the `` direct methods '' ( see e.g. ly et al 2015 , modjaz et al 2008 ) .",
    "the `` direct '' or   method ( seaton 1975 , pagel et al .",
    "1992 , etc ) was used to obtain o / h from the observed oxygen to line ratios . by this method ,",
    "the ranges of the gas physical conditions are chosen among those most suitable to the observed line ratios .",
    "the [ oiii]4363 line derives from the upper @xmath10 level , while [ oiii ] 4959 and 5007 lines derive from the lower @xmath11 level .",
    "the relative rates of excitation of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 levels depend very strongly on the temperature t ( osterbrock 1974 ) .",
    "therefore , t is calculated from the [ oiii]5007+/[oiii ] 4363 ratio , which depends also on the gas density .",
    "this is generally obtained from the [ sii ] 6717/6730 line ratios . in the present spectra",
    "the [ sii]6717,6731 lines were not observed .",
    "moreover , by `` direct methods '' a unique temperature is adopted throughout the whole galaxy , neglecting the physical conditions less adapted to the strongest lines .",
    "this leads to discrepancies between metallicities ( in terms of the o / h relative abundance ) calculated by `` direct methods '' and detailed modelling ( see , e.g. contini 2014a ) , because the gas cools and recombines in the regions far from the photoionization source , as well as downstream of shock - fronts . by detailed modelling",
    "the gas at low ( t@xmath12 10@xmath2k ) temperatures contributes to the line emission .",
    "the line fluxes which result from integration throughout regions of gas at various temperatures are different from those calculated by an homogeneous temperature .",
    "if the fractional abundances of the corresponding ions are low , relatively high o / h are needed to reproduce strong oxygen observed lines .",
    "so , the metallicities calculated by detailed modelling are generally higher than those calculated by `` direct methods '' .",
    "a comparison between the results obtained by `` direct methods '' and detailed modelling ( contini 2014a ) demonstrates that `` direct methods '' lead to o / h lower limits .",
    "detailed modelling of the spectra by pure photoionization models ( e.g. by the cloudy code ) gives satisfying results for intermediate ionization level lines .",
    "however , galaxies at high redshifts often originate from mergers and show a disturbed hydrodynamic structure .",
    "collisional phenomena are critical in the calculation of the spectra .",
    "we suggest that models based on the coupled effect of photoionization and shocks are the closest approximation to the complex structure of the emitting gas .",
    "therefore , the suma code ( contini 2015 and references therein ) is used .",
    "the code simulates the physical conditions in an emitting gaseous cloud under the coupled effect of photoionization from the primary radiation source ( sb or agn ) and shocks .",
    "the line and continuum emission from the gas are calculated consistently with dust - reprocessed radiation in a plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the calculations start at the shock front where the gas is compressed and thermalized adiabatically , reaching the maximum temperature in the immediate post - shock region ( @xmath13 km s@xmath14@xmath15 , where is the shock velocity ) .",
    "t decreases downstream following the cooling rate .",
    "the input parameters such as , the atomic preshock density 0 and the preshock magnetic field 0 ( for all models 0=10@xmath16gauss is adopted ) define the hydrodynamical field .",
    "the input parameters that represent the primary radiation for a sb are the effective temperature and the ionization parameter @xmath17 . for an agn ,",
    "the primary radiation is the power - law radiation flux from the active center @xmath18 in number of photons @xmath19 s@xmath14 ev@xmath14 at the lyman limit and spectral indices @xmath20=-1.5 and @xmath21=-0.7 . the primary radiation source is independent but it affects the surrounding gas .",
    "in contrast , the secondary diffuse radiation is emitted from the slabs of gas heated by the radiation flux reaching the gas and , in particular , by the shock . in our model the gas region surrounding the radiation source",
    "is not considered as a unique cloud , but as an ensemble of fragmented filaments .",
    "the geometrical thickness of these filaments is an input parameter of the code ( d ) which is calculated consistently with the physical conditions and element abundances of the emitting gas .",
    "primary and secondary radiations are calculated by radiation transfer throughout the slabs downstream .",
    "the fractional abundances of the ions are calculated resolving the ionization equations .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath22 ) and the abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , a , fe , relative to h , are also accounted for .    in the modelling process",
    ", we aim to reproduce the observed line ratios for each element .",
    "each line has a different strength which translates into the different precision by the fitting process .",
    "a minimum number of significant lines ( [ oiii ] 5007 + , [ oii]3727 + , [ oiii]4363 , [ nii ] , , ) is necessary to constrain the model but the number of the observed lines does not interfere with the modelling process .",
    "we deal with line ratios to avoid distance and morphological effects .",
    "we start adopting solar abundances by allen ( 1976 ) in the first modelling trials because their values are between the two more recent ones by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and asplund et al ( 2009 )",
    ". a perfect fit of the observed line ratios is not realistic because the observed data have errors , both random and systematic .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculation is due to the atomic parameters ( within 10 % ) which are often updated .",
    "the strongest lines are reproduced by @xmath12 10% , the weakest by @xmath0 50 % .",
    "the calculation code and our modelling method are described by contini ( 2014a , 2016 and references therein ) .    before starting the modelling process of the present survey galaxies ,",
    "some characteristics can be guessed by comparing different line ratios in fig .",
    "the top diagram shows that excluding three objects ( i d 4 , 15 and 16 ) the slope shown by the line ratio band suggests that a radiation mechanism should be adopted . in the bottom diagram , excluding three objects ( i d 4 , 8 and 15 ) , a well defined slope is not seen .",
    "this reveals large ranges of temperatures and densities in the emitting gas , indicating that other mechanisms such as e.g. shocks could be at work .",

    "3 top diagram shows that sb models are definitively in the sb zone , agn models in the agn zone , even if some models calculated for agn galaxies in the outflow case , are on the border line .",
    "for the other two diagrams ( [ oiii]/vs [ nii]/and [ oiii]/vs [ sii]/ ) most of the sb models are on the border line .",
    "this already suggests that some galaxies show a complex character of sb and agn .",
    "the spread of the [ oi]/line ratios and , in particular , the separation between the inflow from the outflow results , is due to the geometrical thickness large range of the emitting clouds in the agn dominated models . in the outflow case ( fig .",
