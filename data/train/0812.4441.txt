    "in the quark - nova ( qn ) picture , ( ouyed et al . 2002 ; kernen et al .",
    "2005 ; hereafter odd and koj respectively ) the core of a neutron star , that undergoes the phase transition to the quark phase , shrinks in a spherically symmetric fashion to a stable , more compact strange matter configuration faster than the overlaying material ( the neutron - rich hadronic envelope ) can respond , leading to an effective core collapse .",
    "the core of the neutron star is a few kilometers in radius initially , but shrinks to 1 - 2 km in a collapse time of about 0.1 ms @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential energy released ( plus latent heat of phase transition ) during this event is converted partly into internal energy and partly into outward propagating shock waves which impart kinetic energy to the material that eventually forms the ejecta .",
    "there are three previously proposed mechanisms for ejection of the outer layers of the neutron star ( i.e. crust ) : ( i ) unstable baryon to quark combustion leading to a shock - driven ejection ( horvath & benvenuto 1988 ) .",
    "more recent work , assuming realistic quark matter equations of state , argues for strong deflagration ( drago et al .",
    "2007 ) that can expel surface material . in these models",
    "up to @xmath5 can be ejected .",
    "these calculations focus on the microphysics and not on the effect of the global state of the resulting quark core which collapses prior to complete combustion ( koj ) , leading to conversion only of the inner core ( @xmath6 1 - 2 km ) of the neutron star ; ( ii ) neutrino - driven explosion where the energy is deposited in a thin ( the densest ) layer at the bottom of the crust above a gap separating it from the collapsing core ( koj ) . for the neutrino - driven mechanism ,",
    "the core bounce was neglected , and neutrinos emitted from the conversion to strange matter transported the energy into the outer regions of the star , leading to heating and subsequent mass ejection .",
    "consequently , mass ejection is limited to about @xmath7 ( corresponding to the crust mass below neutron drip density ) for compact quark cores of size ( 1 - 2 ) km ; ( iii ) thermal fireball driven ejection which we consider for the present study .",
    "the fireball is inherent to the properties of the quark star at birth .",
    "the birth temperature was found to be of the order of 10 - 20 mev since the collapse is adiabatic rather than isothermal ( odd ; koj ) . in this temperature regime",
    "the quark matter is in the superconducting color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase ( rajagopal&wilczek 2001 ) where the photon emissivity dwarfs the neutrino emissivity ( vogt , rapp , & ouyed 2004 ; ouyed , rapp , & vogt 2005 ) .",
    "the average photon energy is @xmath63@xmath8 for a cfl temperature @xmath8 : since the plasma frequency of cfl matter is @xmath9 mev ( e.g. usov 2001 ) , the photon emissivity is highly attenuated as soon as the surface temperature of the star cools below @xmath10  mev . to summarize ,",
    "the thermal fireball is generated as the star cools from its birth temperature down to @xmath11 mev .",
    "here we focus on the case where a qn goes off in isolation , neglecting any interaction with the surroundings , and the crust is ejected by a thermal fireball ( i.e. case ( iii ) above ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is presented as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we discuss the energetics of the qn and the resulting fireball and ensuing crust ejection . sect .",
    "3 deals with the hydrodynamical and thermal evolution of the ejecta .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "the qn ejecta , which is the left - over crust of the parent neutron star , is initially in the shape of a shell and is imparted with energy from the qn explosion .",
    "this energy released during the qn explosion ( @xmath12 ; in units of @xmath13 erg ) is a combination of baryon to quark conversion energy and gravitational energy release due to contraction .",
    "also , the rapid contraction creates a gap between the surface of the collapsed quark matter core and the inner edge of the remaining hadronic matter . before entering",
    "the cfl phase at @xmath14-@xmath15 mev the qs cools mainly by neutrino emission ; as shown in kernen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) a significant fraction of neutrinos escape through the crust .",
    "once the qs core enters the cfl phase , the energy is released in photons ( see vogt et al .",
    "2004 ; ouyed et al .",
    "then at that point thermalization leads to the creation of a @xmath16 fireball with a temperature of 10 - 20 mev .",
    "thus the initial state for crust ejection is a qs core surrounded by a fireball in the gap ( @xmath17 km ) in turn surrounded by the initially stationary neutron star crust .",
    "the general picture is that the fireball from the qn acts as a piston at the base of the crust ; i.e. the qs fireball expands approximately adiabatically while pushing the overlaying crust , and cooling fairly rapidly . using the relativistic force equation , a simple estimate for the timescale to accelerate the crust to lorentz factor of a few is @xmath6 0.1 to 1 millisecond .",
    "the force is due to the fireball pressure ( @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath14 - 20 mev and @xmath20 is the shell s area ) .",
    "the acceleration timescale is only a factor of a few smaller than the free - fall timescale .",
    "as the crust moves outward , the fireball cools approximately adiabatically , with the temperature @xmath8 proportional to @xmath21 with @xmath22 the volume between the quark star surface and the inner edge of the crust .",
    "initially the temperature decreases slowly with @xmath23 then later it decreases as @xmath24 where @xmath23 is the radial position of the crust .",
    "furthermore , the final kinetic energy of the crust for a lorentz factor of @xmath25 is about @xmath26 erg for a @xmath27 crust . thus the energy needed to eject the crust is less than 1% of fireball energy .",
    "the energy input to the crust is mainly kinetic and only a small fraction is thermal since there is no strong shock in this scenario . during the acceleration",
    ", the crust can respond on timescale @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the crust thickness ( about 1 km ) and @xmath30 is the speed of sound in the crust .",
    "the majority of the crust is degenerate with @xmath31 .",
    "the response timescale is @xmath32 seconds , about @xmath33th of the acceleration timescale .",
    "thus no strong shock will be generated except in the outermost non - degenerate ( i.e. low sound speed ) layers ( the mass contained in the non - degenrate layers is small @xmath34 ) .",
    "the bulk of the crust is thus accelerated smoothly by the pressure from the fireball . in comparison ,",
    "a normal sn has the energy of core collapse released into mostly non - degenerate matter .",
    "thus a strong shock is generated . in the qn case ,",
    "most of the crust is highly degenerate with high sound speed , thus it can be accelerated without a strong shock .",
    "one can estimate the lorentz factor of the qn ejecta by , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the efficiency of energy transfer from the qn to the ejecta s kinetic energy in units of 0.1 , and the ejecta mass , @xmath37 is given in units of @xmath27 .",
    "mass ejection in the qn scenario depends on details of energy transfer to the crust .",
    "best estimates of ejected mass from existing calculations are @xmath7-@xmath38 .",
    "we adopt a rounded , fiducial , ejected mass of @xmath27 for the remainder of this paper .",
    "heavier mass ejection would lead to mildly or non - relativistic ejecta .",
    "for ejecta masses higher than @xmath27 the corresponding initial density and size ( i.e. of the neutron star crust ) just before ejection are @xmath39 g @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively ( e.g. datta et al . 1995 ) , where @xmath42 is the radius of the parent neutron star before the qn explosion .",
    "also , the ejecta s birth temperature , @xmath43 , is estimated to be of the order of 10 mev . using general volume expansion ( @xmath44 )",
    ", mass conservation implies that the density of the ejecta will be @xmath45 .",
    "we define @xmath46 by a power law dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath47 with different @xmath46 describing different physical situations , e.g. constant volume , adiabatic , etc .. at this density and temperature the ejecta is relativistic degenerate , so that the fermi energy evolves with radius as @xmath48 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] for details ) .",
    "the total internal energy , @xmath49 , in the ejecta at birth can be estimated to be @xmath50 . here , the ejecta mass is given in units of @xmath27 , its density in units of @xmath51 g @xmath40 , and @xmath52 is the mean molecular weight dominated by the degenerate electrons .",
    "the corresponding heat equation describing the thermal evolution of the ejecta can then be written as @xmath53 where all quantities are expressed in the ejecta s frame .",
    "since the ejecta is expanding relativistically , in its frame we can approximate @xmath54 with @xmath47 in this case being the distance to the star from the ejecta .",
    "this allows the equation above to be recast into , @xmath55      we solve for the heat equation ( eq . [ eq : heat ] ) for the cases of adiabatic and isothermal expansion of the qn ejecta in the shape of a spherical shell .",
    "the expansion is relativistic and assumed to occur at at constant speed .",
    "the analysis is in the ejecta s frame . in the adiabatic case , @xmath56 which leads to @xmath57 . using the expression for @xmath58 ( with @xmath59 ) given in appendix a we arrive at @xmath60 which shows that the temperature goes to zero in finite time corresponding to a radius @xmath61",
    "clearly the radius is too close to the origin which means that in the adiabatic case the ejecta would cool almost immediately and would continue to expand at zero temperature , with @xmath62 . in reality",
    "the ejecta will solidify when it cools below the melting temperature of iron ( see  2.2 below ) .    in the isothermal case , @xmath63",
    ", the heat equation leads to @xmath64 with @xmath65 ; @xmath66 is @xmath42 in units of @xmath67 cm and @xmath68 is @xmath43 in units of 10 mev .",
    "the internal energy @xmath49 goes to zero at a finite radius @xmath69 which corresponds to @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding ejecta density at this radius is @xmath72 gm @xmath40 . for @xmath73 mev",
    "we find @xmath74 for @xmath71 . with a corresponding ejecta density @xmath75 gm @xmath40 .    in summary",
    ", applying the heat equation to the relativistically expanding ejecta shows an almost instantaneous loss of the internal energy .",
    "this mainly due to the @xmath76 work done by the ejecta as it expands or due to its rapidly increase in area which leads to efficient cooling .      in the early stages",
    "the qn ejecta , with a temperature in the tens of mev , resembles a hot molten plasma .",
    "because it is degenerate it cools extremely rapidly ( see appendix a ) .",
    "as the ejecta moves outwards it expands and cools undergoing a liquid to solid transformation ",
    "we will refer to the corresponding radius as the solidification radius @xmath77 .",
    "the state of ions ( in this case iron nuclei ) can be conveniently specified by the coulomb plasma parameter ( e.g. potekhin et al . 1999 ) , @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath20 are the ion charge number and the atomic weight of iron . since here",
    "@xmath80 prior to solidification , the shell material constitutes a strongly coupled liquid .",
    "solidification occurs for @xmath81 which implies a solidification temperature of @xmath82 kev ( see also de blasio 1995 ) .",
    "for example , using equation above and for @xmath71 , an ejecta born at @xmath83 mev and @xmath84-@xmath85 g @xmath40 , will cool to below @xmath86 kev and solidify ( see  2.1 ) when it reaches a radius of @xmath87-@xmath88 .",
    "the solidification radius is then @xmath89-@xmath90 km , at which point the ejecta s density is @xmath91 g @xmath40 ( see appendices [ appendixb ] ) .",
    "the corresponding ejecta density at this radius is @xmath92 gm @xmath40 .",
    "previous studies of decompressed neutron star crust show that the material heats up as it expands because the matter fuses into heavier elements and releases energy , which could prevent crystallization .",
    "the relevant calculations for expanding quark - nova ejecta has been performed in detail in jaikumar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . that work considers r - process in quark - nova ejecta with and without @xmath93-decay heating .",
    "in particular section 3 in that paper discusses the decompression of the ejecta . as can be seen from figures 5 and 6 in jaikumar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) the ejecta does not reheat above 10 kev ( see peak in temperature at time of a few milliseconds ) .",
    "the temperature prior to @xmath93-decay reheating is low enough for crystallization and break - up to occur .",
    "however , @xmath93-decay reheating which peaks at a few milliseconds after ejection ( see figures 5 and 6 in jaikumar et al . 2007 ) might re - melt the crystallized ejecta .",
    "even so , the melting temperature and the temperature of the re - heated ejecta may be similar : this would lead to crystallization at some later time .",
    "finally , we note that those calculations did not include radiative losses so they provide an upper limit on the ejecta reheating temperature , thus increasing the likelihood of crystallization .",
    "regardless of when crystallization occurs , the relativistic expansion causes rapid breakup into small chunks because of the inability of causal communication laterally in the shell . specifically , as the spherical shell expands radially outwards relativistically , it also stretches laterally relativistically is @xmath94 ( see appendix [ appendixd ] ) . ] . since the lateral expansion of the matter in the shell is limited by the speed of sound , @xmath95 , adjacent patches of the shell separate leading to breakup into small clumps .",
    "the breakup depends on the existence of surface tension in the expanding shell . for liquid or solid iron ( our case ) , inter - ionic forces ( mediated by the electrons )",
    "provide the tension .",
    "such a tension does not exist in a gas .",
    "e.g. , for sn ejecta where the shock accelerates the gas beyond the sound speed the lack of surface tension means the particles simply expand away from each other .",
    "an analogy is that of a bursting balloon versus expanding dust . for the innermost sn ejecta",
    "the density may be high enough that it behaves like a liquid rather than a gas . in that case , it is likely the sound speed ( which increases inward ) is higher than the expansion speed in the inner parts ( which decreases inward ; @xmath96 ) . if the sn ejecta is still a liquid at the radius where the expansion speed exceeds the speed of sound then it will be subject to this lateral breakup mechanism .",
    "the size of the clumps depends on whether the breakup occurs in the liquid or solid phase .",
    "we discuss the solid phase case first ; the liquid case differs in having a much larger breakup strain @xmath97 .",
    "as the ejecta solidifies at @xmath77 , a strain rapidly builds up inside as the ejecta continues to expand relativistically . defining the breaking strain of solid iron to be @xmath98 ( e.g. halliday & resnick  13.6 ) then the ejecta break - up occurs at roughly a radius of @xmath99 ( see appendix [ appendixd ] ) .",
    "the typical chunk size at birth is @xmath100 where @xmath101 , or , @xmath102 where we defined @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath97 and the breakup radius are given in units of @xmath104 and 100 km respectively , while the density at solidification radius is in units of @xmath105 g @xmath40 .    .clump",
    "/ chunk properties at breakup for liquid ( l ) and solid ( s ; see appendix [ appendixd ] ) cases [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 lists the properties of the clumps / chunks for the two cases of breakup occurring in early liquid or later solid phase .",
    "if the shell breaks into clumps during the liquid phase , there are two possibilities :    * \\(i ) the chunks will breakup into smaller pieces when they solidify . because of the degeneracy of the ejecta , the cooling is so rapid that even if initial breakup occurs in the liquid phase it will be immediately followed by another breakup governed by the smaller breaking strain @xmath97 of the solid .",
    "since the breakup radius is hardly changed the solid chunk size should be independent of whether clumping first took place during the liquid phase or not . *",
    "\\(ii ) the ambient temperature remains high enough to keep the clumps liquid as they expand .",
    "we note that as the density drops due to expansion , the crystallization temperature also drops ( @xmath106 since @xmath107 ) .",
    "there is a delicate competition between the dropping ambient temperature and the dropping crystallization temperature .    in summary ,",
    "if during the radial expansion , the ambient temperature drops below @xmath108 , then the liquid will crystallize .",
    "we adopt case ( i ) as our fiducial case .",
    "however most of our results are the same for both cases and we note whenever case ( ii ) gives a different outcome . in what follows",
    "we use the term chunks to refer to either the small solid iron pieces or the larger liquid clumps .      beyond the break - up radius , @xmath109 ,",
    "the chunks remain in contact with each other within the relativistically expanding ejecta as a whole .",
    "this is because the pieces expand in volume , filling up the space between them , and causing the density of each piece to continuously decrease , until they reach the zero pressure iron density ( @xmath110 g @xmath40 ) , at which point they stop expanding .",
    "if we define a filling factor to be , @xmath111 at @xmath109 , then it will remain unity until some separation radius @xmath112 .",
    "this radius of separation can be found from equation ( [ eq : rhoshell ] ) . with @xmath113 and",
    "our fiducial values this radius is @xmath114 which implies that the chunks remain closely packed until the ejecta as a whole reaches @xmath115 cm .",
    "this is an upper limit for the separation radius since we neglected the effects of the ions ( see appendix b ) .    an estimation of the cross - sectional area extended by each chunk just before separation is given by @xmath116 , or , @xmath117 ( see appendix [ appendixd ] for details ) .",
    "furthermore , their length can be found , from equation ( [ eq : drshell ] ) , to be @xmath118 .",
    "hence , we expect the chunk s length is roughly a hundred times its width for case ( i ) or equal to its width for case ( ii ) . in the observer s frame",
    "the ratio of length to width will be contracted by a factor of @xmath119 . for case ( i )",
    ", the chunks thus resemble what we will refer to as  iron needles \" , reminiscent of the subjet model of toma et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in the context of grbs .",
    "finally , as the chunks expand radially outwards to a radius @xmath120 , we can associate a filling factor @xmath121 .",
    "in this paper we investigate the thermal and dynamic evolution of a relativistically expanding iron - rich shell from a qn explosion .",
    "the qn produces a photon fireball which acts as piston to eject and accelerate the crust of the parent neutron star to mildly relativistic speeds .",
    "we find that the shell rapidly cools and breaks up into numerous ( @xmath122 to @xmath123 ) chunks because of the rapid lateral expansion .",
    "breakup may occur while the material is in liquid or solid phase : if liquid the chunks are nearly spherical ; if solid they are needle shaped moving parallel to their long axis .",
    "although the presented model is based on physical arguments , most of these are in reality more complicated and so would require more detailed studies and the help of numerical simulations .",
    "for example , the process of clumping , crystallization , and breakup of the ejecta , would require better knowledge of the ambient conditions surrounding the ejecta .",
    "the astrophysical implications will be discussed elsewhere .    this work is supported by an operating grant from the natural research council of canada ( nserc ) .",
    "the fermi energy for a relativistic and a non - relativistic gas is @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively ( e.g. shapiro&teukolsky 1983 ; p24 ) .",

    "the ejecta thickness increases in time at the speed of sound @xmath139 with @xmath140 in the ejecta s frame .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the ejecta s density quickly drops below the transition density @xmath141 g @xmath40 so that most of the ejecta thickness expansion occurs during the non - relativistic degenerate phase .",
