    "we have fixed @xmath60 by matching the width of the pion rapidity distribution .",
    "the data then favour clearly a lifetime of @xmath61 fm / c ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) but are not very sensitive to the emission duration @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the present plots are obtained with @xmath62 fm / c .",
    "@xmath63 discards opaque sources _ : + for the model ( [ 3]-[5 ] ) , the ykp - parameter @xmath63 is mainly sensitive to the temporal aspects of the source .",

    "the radius of a cold pb nucleus corresponds to @xmath64 fm in the gaussian parametrization ( [ 4 ] ) , i.e. , the experimental data indicate a very large source @xmath65 .",
    "this is dynamically consistent with a collision scenario in which the initially produced pressure gradients result in a significant transverse flow @xmath66 , driving the expansion of the system over a time of 9 fm / c to twice its initial size .",
    "the temperature may have decreased substantially during this expansion ; the data indicate 130 mev at freeze - out .",
    "these conclusions are further supported by the analysis presented by g. roland  @xcite , which is based on approximate analytical formulas .",
    "we have extracted the model parameters by comparison to numerical model calculations , following the above strategy .",
    "they are not obtained from a simultaneous fit to all observables , and hence we do not quote errors .",
    "the reaction plane analysis of triple - differential one - particle spectra ( [ 1 ] ) has been discussed extensively in this conference e.g. by a. poskanzer , j .- y .",
    "ollitrault , and s. voloshin . the general strategy for linking this analysis to an azimuthally sensitive particle interferometry",
    "is based on the @xmath67-dependence of the hbt - radii  @xcite , where @xmath67 measures the azimuthal angle of @xmath68 relative to the reaction plane , @xmath69 here , the many harmonic coefficients @xmath70 make a direct comparison to experimental data impossible",
    ". however , various relations hold amongst these coefficients , since the leading anisotropy in realistic source models @xmath4 can be quantified by very few parameters only . using the symmetries of the system and assuming that elliptic deformations dominate we find  @xcite @xmath71 a violation of eqs .",
