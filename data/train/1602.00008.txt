    "the generic task of quantum error correction is to find two logical code words  a qubit  embedded in a large hilbert space .",
    "the code words are required to be robust such that if any one of the single , independent errors @xmath12 occurs , no quantum information is lost and any quantum superposition of the logical code words can be faithfully recovered .",
    "this is equivalent to finding two logical code words @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , that satisfy the quantum error correction criteria  @xcite , known also as the knill - laflamme conditions  @xcite , @xmath15 for all @xmath16 such that @xmath17 are entries of a hermitian matrix and independent of the logical words .",
    "the independence of entries @xmath17 from the logical code words and the structure of the non - diagonal entries guarantee that the different errors are distinguishable and correctable .",
    "we consider a damped harmonic oscillator suffering from photon losses .",
    "our intention is to design logical code words , which are embedded in the hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator and protected up to @xmath18 photon loss events occurring in the time interval @xmath19 between two consecutive quantum correction stages .",
    "the set of discrete errors is @xmath20  . ] .",
    "we will see that satisfying the conditions for these errors is sufficient to produce a code that is systematically correctable up to a given order in @xmath21 under the full amplitude damping operators . here",
    "our primary focus will be on photon loss errors .",
    "later we will discuss correcting photon gain @xmath22 and dephasing errors @xmath23 .",
    "suppose we restrict our attention to the lowest @xmath24 fock states of a single mode of a resonator .",
    "this hilbert space is the same size as that for @xmath25 qubits and if one had complete control over it , one could imagine having a kind of hardware shortcut in which a single resonator mode replaces a complex of @xmath25 physical qubits to form one or more logical qubits  @xcite .",
    "notice that increasing the size of the hilbert space does not increase the number of error channels or the minimal number of error syndromes .",
    "consider the following simple encoding of @xmath25 qubits into the state of the resonator .",
    "the @xmath24 fock states cover photon numbers @xmath26 .",
    "let photon fock state @xmath27 be represented by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the binary representation of the number @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31th binary digit represents the eigenvalue @xmath32 for the corresponding ` physical qubit . '",
    "this appears to be a very simple and satisfactory encoding but consider what happens when the @xmath33 state ( say ) loses a single photon @xmath34 .",
    "what seems to be a simple error model in terms of photon loss actually becomes a model with correlated multi - qubit errors .",
    "hence typical quantum error correction schemes based on models of independent single qubit errors can not be easily transferred to this problem  @xcite . because the mean photon loss rate @xmath35 scales exponentially with @xmath25",
    ", we will focus here on representing a single logical qubit using a small number of states in the cavity to permit error correction .",
    "an example of a code protecting against @xmath36 is @xmath37 a photon loss error brings the logical code words to a subspace with odd photon numbers that is clearly disjoint from the even - parity subspace of the logical code words .",
    "therefore , the off - diagonal parts of the quantum error correction matrix   @xmath38 are identically zero .",
    "the remaining diagonal part of @xmath38 requires that the mean photon number is identical for both of the states , here @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the probability of a photon jump to occur ( or not to occur ) is the same for both of the states , implying that the quantum state is not deformed under an error .",
    "explicitly , if a quantum state @xmath40 suffers a photon jump , it is transformed to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the error words .",
    "the quantum information ( the complex coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) is not deformed .    in the optical regime , the photon loss error can be detected by an external photodetector .",
    "this is not yet practical in the microwave regime , but fortunately we have the capability of very high fidelity quantum non - demolition measurements of the photon number parity  @xcite .",
    "the original state is recovered by a unitary operation @xmath46 that performs the state transfer @xmath47 ; see appendix  [ app : binom_unitary ] for details . correcting a non - unitary error with a unitary operation works only because it is conditioned on the detection outcome of the particular error .",
    "notice that the code   is similar to a code developed in ref .",

    "et al . _",
    "for a multi - mode system .",
    "our code has the important advantages of requiring only a single bosonic mode and having rate for uncorrectable errors that is smaller by a factor of three ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] ) .",
    "generalizations of the code   are possible , for example @xmath48 in addition to the logical words having the same mean photon number , the error words @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 also have the same mean photon number .",
    "thus the code can tolerate another photon loss error and the protected error set is @xmath52 .",
    "the photon loss errors are detected by measuring photon number @xmath53 ; see appendix  [ app : binom_unitary ] .",
    "the error recovery procedure is similar to that above : an error detection is followed by a unitary operation performing a state transfer @xmath54 .",
    "the error correction matrix @xmath38 for the code   is diagonal because of the sufficiently large spacing of the occupied fock states in the logical words such that photon loss errors @xmath55 , @xmath56 , can not lead to overlap of the error words .",
    "frequency fluctuations of the cavity ( _ i.e. _  noise @xmath57 coupling to the photon number , @xmath58 , for example by transitions of a dispersively coupled ancilla qubit  @xcite ) cause dephasing of the quantum memory . in the limit of fast markovian noise , the effect of fluctuations is well approximated by a lindblad dissipator with a jump operator @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the dephasing rate . even in the case of non - markovian",
    "noise , the errors take the form @xmath61 .",
    "for small enough timesteps @xmath19 this error can be expanded as superposition of @xmath62 operators .",
    "thus in both cases protection can be achieved by considering the operator @xmath23 and its higher powers . in what follows",
    "we will refer to these operators as dephasing errors .    due to the spacing of the fock states and the properties of bosonic operators , the code   protects also against a dephasing error @xmath23 ,",
    "thus the full error set is @xmath63 .",
    "since the dephasing error does not change the photon number , it leads to an error state @xmath64 , @xmath65 which is a superposition of the original words and the error words related to the dephasing @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the only way to detect the dephasing error is to make projective measurements into the logical word basis @xmath68 and if the answer is negative and no photon loss errors were detected , the original state is recovered by making a unitary operation performing a state transfer @xmath69 .",
    "remarkably such complex operations applied to a cavity - ancilla qubit systems are now technically feasible  @xcite .",
    "the code   can instead be chosen to be protected against errors @xmath70 since a photon gain error and two - photon loss errors have the same change in the photon number @xmath53 and the logical code words already obey the quantum error correction condition for the photon gain error : @xmath71 . as a special case",

    "we now generalize the above codes to protect against the error set , @xmath74 which includes up to @xmath18  photon losses , up to @xmath75  photon gain errors , and up to @xmath76  dephasing events . we have found a simple class of codes which can correct such an error set , @xmath77 } \\sqrt{\\binom{n+1}{p}}\\ket{p(s+1 ) } , \\label{eq : binomial}\\ ] ] where the spacing is @xmath78 , maximum order @xmath79 and the range of the index @xmath80 is from @xmath2 to @xmath81 .",

    "encoding the different outcomes of a multi - valued measurement , such as @xmath109 , in the higher excited states of the ancillary qubit would allow single - shot measurements .",
    "an alternative is to do @xmath104 sequential measurements with a two - level qubit .",
    "dephasing errors result in mutually non - orthogonal error states : for them the quantum error correction matrix is non - diagonal but hermitian . for that reason , to detect and recover those errors one needs to make projective measurements in an orthonormalized basis , as with the code  . after a detection of an error ,",
    "the original state is recovered by a unitary operation performing a state transfer between the subspaces of the error and logical code words .",

    "@xmath76 can be increased without a limit .",
    "this gives the maximum order as @xmath114 .",

    "when choosing a code , the minimum value of @xmath8 is determined by the term with the largest total number of @xmath111 and @xmath22 operators .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 ( @xmath75 ) is given by the error term that causes the largest overall decrease ( increase ) in excitation number .",
    "for example , to correct @xmath128 requires @xmath129 from the first term , @xmath130 from the second term and @xmath131 as there are no number - decreasing terms .",
    "up to now we have assumed that the cavity is subject to a finite set of discrete errors .",
    "in fact , the cavity evolves continuously in time . for example , the standard lindblad time evolution of a density matrix @xmath132 of a cavity coupled to a zero - temperature bath with a cavity energy decay rate @xmath9 ( represented in the frame rotating at the cavity frequency ) is @xmath133 in a finite time interval @xmath19 , continuous - time evolution results in an infinite set of possible errors .",
    "exact quantum error correction of the full set of errors is not possible .",
    "however , the probabilities of the errors scale with powers of @xmath134 and we can choose to correct only the most important errors in @xmath134 .",

    "we expand each error operator in powers of @xmath134 and choose to correct up to a given highest order .",

    "initially , we consider only photon loss errors due to cavity damping and extend the discussion for photon gain and dephasing processes later .",
    "one can ` unravel ' the lindblad equation   for photon loss errors by considering the conditional quantum evolution of the system based on the measurement record of a photomultiplier that clicks whenever a photon leaks out of the cavity . in this quantum trajectory picture",

    "an important feature of the damped simple harmonic oscillator is that the precise timing of the the photon jumps plays no role .",

    "it reduces the relative probability of the higher occupied fock states with respect to the lower ones , formally expressed with the factor @xmath146 in the error operators  .",
    "others have addressed this by constructing multimode codes  @xcite .",

    "<S> our codes are similar in spirit to ` cat codes ' based on superpositions of the coherent states , but offer several advantages such as smaller mean boson number , exact rather than approximate orthonormality of the code words , and an explicit unitary operation for repumping energy into the bosonic mode . </S>",

    "<S> there is lively current interest in novel schemes for robustly encoding quantum information in bosonic modes  @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> early work by chuang  _ et  al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite developed two - mode bosonic codes which can protect quantum information against amplitude damping of the bosonic field . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a new class of codes that are similar but have two distinct advantages : they require only a single bosonic mode ( not two with identical decay rates ) , and they can correct other errors , _ e.g. _ ,   dephasing in addition to amplitude damping . </S>",
    "<S> our codes are also similar in spirit to the ` cat codes '  @xcite and indeed asymptotically approach them in certain parameter limits . </S>",
    "<S> however our codes require a smaller mean boson number to achieve a given fidelity , and are defined in a finite hilbert space , making explicit construction of the required unitary operations more straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> besides extending the lifetimes of bosonic qubits or quantum memories , we describe how such codes could be useful in increasing the fidelity of quantum communication and remote entanglement between hardware modules through photon ` pitch and catch ' protocols  @xcite as well as in improving the fidelity of communication based on reversible microwave to optical state conversion  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> superconducting microwave resonators are simpler than josephson junction based qubits and can readily be constructed to have lifetimes even longer than the best qubits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore interesting to consider the possibility of using microwave resonators as qubits or as quantum memories . experimental capabilities to arbitrarily control the quantum state of a hybrid cavity - qubit system are now so advanced  @xcite that it is time to take the next step and develop optimal quantum error correction codes that further extend the lifetimes of photonic quantum bits and memories .    because a resonator mode is a simple harmonic oscillator with equidistant level spacing , the only quantum states that can be accessed via classical linear drives are simple coherent states . to create more useful quantum superpositions of photon fock states which can store quantum information , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to couple the bosonic mode to a non - linear element , _ </S>",

    "<S> experiments have demonstrated coherent mapping of a superconducting qubit state onto the corresponding coherent superposition of @xmath2 and @xmath3 photons in a resonator  @xcite and the creation of more complex superpositions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later experiments with superconducting qubits and cavities demonstrated the ability to transfer the qubit state into the cavity for a period @xmath4s much longer than the qubit lifetime and then return it to the qubit prior to verification via process tomography  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , it is also now possible to make quantum non - demolition measurements of photon number parity  @xcite which can be used to greatly simplify the measurement of wigner functions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such parity measurements are utilized as the error syndrome measurement in cat codes  @xcite and will be used in some of the codes presented here . more generally , by employing optimal control pulses  @xcite for engineering the driving terms of both a harmonic oscillator and a coupled non - linear element </S>",

    "<S> if the errors are uncorrelated single - qubit errors , the bare error rate is @xmath8 times faster than for a single qubit . </S>",
    "<S> thus the quantum error correction protocol must overcome this factor of @xmath8 in order to reach break - even . if the errors are highly correlated , _ </S>",

    "<S> there is no evidence that correlated errors are a significant problem for well - shielded superconducting qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> another potential advantage of resonators is that the error model appears to be very simple . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant source of decoherence is the energy loss of the cavity as it slowly emits photons into its output and input ports . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity energy ring - down rate @xmath9 is the analog of @xmath10 for a qubit . to date </S>",
    "<S> , there is no evidence of dephasing errors associated with frequency fluctuations of 3d metallic superconducting cavities though dephasing has been seen in coplanar waveguide resonators by the zmuidzinas group  @xcite and attributed to two - level systems in the dielectric substrate . </S>",
    "<S> however dispersive coupling of a qubit to a resonator will introduce random fluctuations of the cavity frequency associated with @xmath11 state change events in the qubit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , there can be , for example , energy leakage from the driven ancillary qubit to the resonator that can be result in photon gain errors . </S>",
