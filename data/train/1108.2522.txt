    "the mechanism of exclusive production of mesons at high energies became recently a very active field of research ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) . these reactions @xmath7 ,",

    "the recent works concentrated on the production of @xmath9 mesons ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) where the qcd mechanism is similar to the exclusive production of the higgs boson . furthermore",
    ", the @xmath10 states are expected to annihilate via two - gluon processes into light mesons and may , therefore , allow the study of glueball production dynamics .",
    "the two - pion background to exclusive production of @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite mesons was already discussed . in ref .",
    "@xcite a new perturbative mechanism of the @xmath12 production was discussed . due to reasons explained in ref .",
    "@xcite this mechanism gives relatively small contribution in the @xmath2 invariant mass region .",
    "the cdf collaboration has measured the cross section of cep @xmath9 mesons in proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron @xcite . in this experiment @xmath9",
    "mesons are identified via decay to the @xmath13 with @xmath14 channel .",
    "the experimental invariant mass resolution was not sufficient to distinguish between scalar , axial and tensor @xmath9 . while the branching fractions to this channel for axial and tensor mesons are large @xcite ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) the branching fraction for the scalar meson is very small @xmath17 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross section for exclusive @xmath2 production obtained within the @xmath3-factorization is much bigger than that for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . as a consequence ,",
    "all @xmath20 mesons give similar contributions @xcite to the @xmath13 decay channel .",
    "clearly , the measurement via decay to the @xmath13 channel can not provide cross section for different @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath2 meson decays into several two - body channels ( e.g. @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) or four - body hadronic modes ( e.g. @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have analyzed a possibility to measure @xmath2 via its decay into @xmath26 channel @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction @xmath27 is large , the axial @xmath18 does not decay to the @xmath21 channel and @xmath28 is smaller @xcite .",
    "in addition a much smaller cross section for @xmath19 production means that in practise only @xmath2 will contribute to the signal .",

    "is described by the diagram shown in fig .",

[ fig : central_double_diffraction_diagrams_fsi ] .",
    "the expected non - resonant background can be modeled using a `` non - perturbative '' framework where the pion pair is produced by pomeron - pomeron fusion with an intermediate off - shell pion / reggeon exchanged between the final - state particle pairs ( see @xcite for details ) . in calculations of the amplitude",
    "we follow the general rules of pumplin and henyey @xcite used recently in ref .",
    "@xcite where a first estimate of the differential cross sections for the @xmath26 pairs production at the lhc energies has been presented .",
    "the regge parametrization of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 scattering amplitude includes both pomeron as well as @xmath34 and @xmath35 reggeon exchanges with the parameters taken from the donnachie - landshoff analysis @xcite of the total cross sections .",
    "the regge - type interaction applies at higher energies and at low energies should be switched off ( see @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we propose to use a generalized propagator .",
    "the form factors correct for the off - shellness of the intermediate pions are parametrized as @xmath36 , where the parameter @xmath37 is obtained from fit to the experimental data @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we first show ( fig .  [",
    "fig : diff_comp ] ) the differential cross sections of @xmath2 cep at @xmath38 = 14 tev without ( dashed line ) and with ( solid line ) absorptive corrections .",
    "these calculations were done with gjr nlo @xcite collinear gluon distribution , to generate the kmr ugdfs , which allows to use low values of the internal gluon transverse momenta @xmath39 gev@xmath40 .",
    "the bigger the value of the cut - off parameter , the smaller the cross section ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the calculations",
    "we take the value of the hard scale to be @xmath41 .",
    "the smaller @xmath42 , the bigger the cross section @xcite . in all cases",
    "the absorption effects lead to a damping of the cross section . in most cases",
    "the shape is almost unchanged .",
    "exception is the distribution in proton transverse momentum where the absorption effects lead to a damping of the cross section at small proton @xmath43 and an enhancement of the cross section at large proton @xmath43 . in relative azimuthal angle distribution",
    "we observe a dip at @xmath44 .",
    "transverse momentum distribution of @xmath2 shows a small minimum at @xmath45 2.5 gev .",
    "the main reason of its appearance is the functional dependence of matrix elements on its arguments @xcite .     +    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsig_dmpipi ] we compare differential distributions of pions from the @xmath2 decay ( see the peak at @xmath46 gev ) with those for the continuum pions .",
    "while left panels show the cross section integrated over the full phase space , the right panels show results including the relevant pion pseudorapidities restrictions @xmath47 ( rhic and tevatron ) and @xmath48 ( lhc ) .",
    "the @xmath2 contribution is calculated with grv94 nlo @xcite and gjr08 nlo @xcite collinear gluon distributions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_lhc ] we show distributions in pion transverse momenta ( left panels ) .",
    "the pions from the @xmath2 decay are placed at slightly larger transverse momenta .",
    "this can be therefore used to get rid of the bulk of the continuum by imposing an extra cut on the pion transverse momenta . in the right panels we show two - pion invariant mass distributions with additional cuts on both pion transverse momenta @xmath49 gev .",
    "now the signal - to - background ratio is somewhat improved especially at the tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "the main experimental task is to measure the distributions in the @xmath2 rapidity and transverse momentum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we show the two - dimensional ratio of the cross sections for the @xmath2 meson in its rapidity and transverse momentum : @xmath50 the numerator includes limitations on @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these distributions provide a fairly precise evaluation of the expected acceptances when experimental cuts are imposed .",
    "the experimental data could be corrected by our two - dimensional acceptance function to recover the distributions of interest .",
    "it was realized recently that the measurement of exclusive production of @xmath20 via decay in the @xmath13 channel can not give production cross sections for different species of @xmath20 . in this decay channel",
    "the contributions of @xmath20 mesons with different spins are similar and experimental resolution is not sufficient to distinguish them .",
    "we have analyzed a possibility to measure the exclusive production of @xmath2 meson in the proton-(anti)proton collisions at the lhc , tevatron and rhic via @xmath53 decay channel .",
    "since the cross section for exclusive @xmath2 production is much larger than that for @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the branching fraction to the @xmath21 channel for @xmath2 is larger than that for @xmath19 ( @xmath18 does not decay into two pions ) the two - pion channel should provide an useful information about the @xmath2 cep .",
    "we have performed detailed studies of several differential distributions and demonstrated how to impose extra cuts in order to improve the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the two - pion background was calculated in a simple model with parameters adjusted to low energy data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that relevant measurements at tevatron and lhc are possible . at rhic",
    "the signal - to - background ratio is much worse but measurements should be possible as well . imposing cuts distorts the original distributions for @xmath2 in rapidity and transverse momentum .",
    "we have demonstrated how to recover the original distributions and presented the correction functions for some typical experimental situations .",
