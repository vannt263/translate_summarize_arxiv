    "<S> we investigate the field - angle - dependent zero - energy density of states for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c with using realistic fermi surfaces obtained by band calculations . </S>",
    "<S> both the 17th and 18th bands are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> for calculating the oscillating density of states , we adopt the kramer - pesch approximation , which is found to improve accuracy in the oscillation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we show that superconducting gap structure determined by analyzing stm experiments is consistent with thermal transport and heat capacity measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the nonmagnetic borocarbide superconductor yni@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite has attracted considerable attention because of the growing evidence for highly anisotropic superconducting gap and high superconducting transition temperature 15.5k . in recent years , </S>",
    "<S> maki _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite theoretically suggested that the gap symmetry of this material is @xmath1+@xmath2 wave and the gap function has zero points ( point nodes ) in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this prediction , field - angle dependence of the heat capacity @xcite and the thermal conductivity @xcite have been measured on yni@xmath3b@xmath3c . </S>",
    "<S> the gap symmetry can be deduced from their oscillating behavior . </S>",
    "<S> those experimental results @xcite were considered to be consistent with the @xmath1+@xmath2-wave gap . </S>",
    "<S> however , the present authors @xcite recently found that the local density of states ( ldos ) around a vortex calculated for the @xmath1+@xmath2-wave gap on an isotropic fermi surface ( fs ) is not consistent with measurements by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we calculated the ldos around a vortex with the use of a realistic fs of the 17th band obtained by a band calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigated the density of states ( dos ) under zero field and the field - angle dependence of the zero - energy dos ( zedos ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we proposed alternative gap structure for yni@xmath3b@xmath3c and succeeded in reproducing those experimental observations consistently @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the field - angle - dependent zedos taking the 18th band into account in addition to the 17th band considered previously . while the so - called doppler - shift ( ds ) method was previously utilized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we adopt here a more reliable method @xcite for calculating the zedos .    </S>",
    "<S> the dos is the basis for analyzing physical quantities such as the specific heat and the thermal conductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the specific heat @xmath4 is proportional to the zedos in the zero temperature limit @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the dos is obtained from the regular green function @xmath2 within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity , which is represented by a parametrization with @xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> they follow the riccati equations ( @xmath9 ) @xcite : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath12 with the matsubara frequency @xmath13 and the vector potential @xmath14 .    to analyze the field - angle - dependent experiments quantitatively , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a method on the basis of the kramer - pesch approximation ( kpa ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method enables us to take account of the vortex - core contribution which is neglected in the ds method . by virtue of it </S>",
    "<S> , one can achieve quantitative accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a single vortex situated at the origin of the coordinates . to take account of the contributions of a vortex core , in the kpa we expand the riccati equations ( [ eq : ar ] ) and ( [ eq : br ] ) up to first order in the impact parameter @xmath15 around a vortex and the energy @xmath13  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( @xmath16 and @xmath15 is the coordinate along the direction perpendicular to @xmath11 ) . by this expansion </S>",
    "<S> , one can obtain an analytic solution of the riccati equations around a vortex . </S>",
    "<S> we then find the expression for the angular - resolved dos @xcite @xmath17^{\\frac{-2 \\lambda}{\\pi h } }    } { ( e - e_y)^2 + \\eta^2 }   \\biggl{\\rangle}_{\\rm sp}. \\label{eq : dos}\\ ] ] here , the azimuthal ( polar ) angle of the magnetic field @xmath18 is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in a spherical coordinate frame fixed to crystal axes , and @xmath21 is an area element on the fs [ e.g. , @xmath22 for a spherical fs in the spherical coordinates @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for a cylindrical fs in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath25 . in the cylindrical coordinate frame @xmath26 with @xmath27 in the real space </S>",
    "<S> , the pair potential is @xmath28 around a vortex , @xmath29 is the maximum pair amplitude in the bulk , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the real - space average around a vortex , where @xmath32 [ @xmath33 , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is the angle of @xmath39 in the plane of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are measured from a common axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is the vector component of @xmath43 projected onto the plane normal to @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the fs average of @xmath47 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider here a clean sc in the type - ii limit . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity effect can be incorporated through the smearing factor @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the angular dependence of the zedos ( @xmath51 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dos ] ) ) for yni@xmath3b@xmath3c with using the band structure calculated by yamauchi _ et al_.  @xcite . when integrating eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dos ] ) , the band structure is reflected in @xmath21 and @xmath11 ( @xmath39 , @xmath46 , and @xmath52 are obtained from @xmath11 ) . in yni@xmath3b@xmath3c </S>",
    "<S> there are three bands crossing the fermi level , which are called the 17th , 18th , and 19th bands . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons of the 17th band predominantly contribute to the superconductivity , since the dos at the fermi level for the 17th , 18th , and 19th bands are 48.64 , 7.88 , and 0.38 states / ry , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider here the fss of the 17th and 18th bands and neglect the 19th band because the dos is substantially small on the 19th fs . </S>",
    "<S> we use an anisotropic @xmath1-wave gap structure obtained in our preceding paper ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 27 ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) for the 17th fs . </S>",
    "<S> this gap structure was determined by analyzing stm observations @xcite . as for the 18th fs </S>",
    "<S> , we assume an isotropic gap with an amplitude equal to the maximum gap on the 17th fs , according to angular - resolved photo emission measurements @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> angular dependence of the zedos for yni@xmath3b@xmath3c ( a):with use of the 17th band , ( b ) : that of 18th band and ( c ) that of the 17th and 18th bands . the magnetic field tilts from the @xmath53 axis by polar angle @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 and @xmath56 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we rotate the applied magnetic field in the basal plane perpendicular to the @xmath53 axis ( @xmath57 ) and investigate the azimuthal angle @xmath19 dependence of the zedos . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show the partial zedos on the 17th fs only . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) , the oscillation amplitude is of the order 9  % . </S>",
    "<S> previously we have calculated the zedos by the ds method under the same condition and obtained the amplitude of the order 30  % @xcite , which was too large in comparison to experimental results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the kpa adopted in this paper yields substantial improvement in the amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we show the partial zedos on the 18th fs only . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) , the cusp - like minima appear . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the cusp - like structure is different from that of the 17th - fs case , since the gap is isotropic on the 18th fs while it is anisotropic on the 17th fs . </S>",
    "<S> the cusp - like minima are due to the fs anisotropy on the 18th fs . according to the band calculation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , the shape of the 18th fs is like a square as viewed from the @xmath58 axis in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> the sides of this square are parallel to the @xmath59 or @xmath60 axis </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the region where the fermi velocity is parallel to the @xmath59 or @xmath60 axis has a high proportion of the area on the 18th fs . </S>",
    "<S> now , the quasiparticles with the fermi velocity parallel to the magnetic field do not contribute to the zedos ( e.g. , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . as a result , when the magnetic field is rotated near the directions parallel to those axes , the change in the zedos is drastic , leading to cusp - like minima . </S>",
    "<S> udagawa _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite previously obtained cusp - like minima in the field - angle - dependent zedos by using a square - like fs model . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of their cusp - like minima is the same as that of the present result for the 18th fs . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the dos ratio @xmath61 of the 18th fs to the 17th fs is @xmath62 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the 18th fs is not dominant , and therefore the cusp - like minima observed in the experiments @xcite probably can not be attributed to the square shape of the fs only .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show the total zedos on both the 17th and 18th fss . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) , the oscillation amplitude is of the order 8 % and the overall behavior is almost similar to that for the 17th fs shown in fig .  [ fig:1](a ) . in the thermal conductivity measurements in yni@xmath3b@xmath3c , </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation amplitude in the field 1 t and 0.5 t is of the order 2  % @xcite and 4.5  % @xcite , respectively , at the same temperature 0.43 k. in the heat capacity measurements @xcite , the oscillation amplitude in 1 t at 2 k is of the order 4.7  % . </S>",
    "<S> the kpa is an approximation appropriate in the limit of the low temperature and low magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in terms of the order of the oscillation amplitude , our result could be considered to be consistent with that of those experiments . as for the directions of the minima , </S>",
    "<S> the result is also consistent with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> those mean that the assumed gap structure determined by analyzing stm experiments ( eq .  ( 27 ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) is consistent with the heat capacity @xcite and the thermal transport @xcite observations . </S>",
    "<S> so far we have found here that inclusion of the 18th - fs contribution does not drastically alter our previous conclusion @xcite , and the use of the kpa improves the value of the amplitude compared to our result @xcite by the ds method . </S>",
    "<S> we should note , however , that the sharpness of the cusp is rather weak in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) in comparison to the experimental observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this point may be resolved by considering carefully the @xmath58 dependence of the gap structure . </S>",
    "<S> the gap structure used here was determined to explain the azimuthal dependence of the observations in the basal plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a modification of the gap structure would be necessary to explain the observed polar - angle dependence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is left for future studies . here </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that such a detailed discussion is almost impossible till the kpa @xcite is developed as a new method with high precision .    in conclusion , we calculated the field - angle - dependent zedos on the fss from 17th and 18th band of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c . </S>",
    "<S> we adopted the gap structure @xcite determined by comparison with stm observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation amplitude was found to be of the order 8 % . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude does not deviate so much from the heat capacity @xcite and the thermal transport @xcite measurements . </S>",
    "<S> as for the directions of the minima , the result is also consistent with those experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the assumed gap structure on the 17th fs is essentially appropriate for the in - plane properties . </S>",
    "<S> further modification of the gap structure is expected in terms of the @xmath63 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the kpa improved the value of the amplitude compared to our previous result @xcite by the ds method . </S>",
    "<S> the kpa @xcite appears to be an efficient method with high precision for analyzing experimental data .    </S>",
