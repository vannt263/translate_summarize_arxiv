    "carbon monoxide is the second most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds after h@xmath8 , with readily observable electronic transitions in the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) , vibrational bands in the infrared , and pure rotational lines in the mm - wave regime .",

    "the first vuv detection of rotationally unresolved fourth - positive ( @xmath9@xmath0@xmath10 ) absorption bands from interstellar @xmath1c@xmath4o and @xmath6c@xmath4o was reported by @xcite ",
    "see @xcite for an extensive review of the fourth - positive bands .",
    "however , most measurements of various co species come from radio observations of molecular clouds with substantial total column densities ( @xmath11 ) of co. @xcite reported the first mm observations of @xmath1c@xmath4o and @xmath6c@xmath4o in dark clouds .",
    "rarer co varieties were reported later : @xmath1c@xmath3o by @xcite , @xmath1c@xmath2o by @xcite , and @xmath6c@xmath3o by @xcite .",
    "the `` final '' milestone for radio co was recently reached by @xcite , who reported the detection of the rarest stable co isotopomer , @xmath6c@xmath2o , in the @xmath12 oph molecular cloud . in the vuv ,",
    "absorption from co is sought , but such observations sample substantially smaller @xmath11(co ) than are commonly observed in the radio because ultraviolet extinction limits the number of suitable targets behind molecular clouds .",
    "a@xmath0x _ rotational lines of interstellar absorption bands have been fully resolved and measured only for @xmath1c@xmath4o and @xmath6c@xmath4o , using the echelle grating of the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on board the @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a previous detection with a ghrs first - order grating of rotationally unresolved @xmath1c@xmath3o was reported by @xcite toward @xmath14 oph .    in this letter",
    "we report the first vuv detection of interstellar absorption from @xmath1c@xmath2o bands , and present the first unblended measurements of its sibling , @xmath1c@xmath3o .",
    "these observations were made toward x per ( hd 24534 ) , using grating e140h of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) for data sets o64812010@xmath0030 and o64813010@xmath0020 .",
    "the star was observed through the smallest aperture ( 0.1  @xmath15 0.025 , the `` jenkins slit '' ) , providing the highest @xmath13 resolving power of @xmath16 = 200,000 over @xmath17 = 1316 to 1517  .",

    "we compare co isotopomeric ratios with ambient carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the context of theoretical models of translucent clouds .",
    "with the help of optically thin intersystem bands of co , we derived @xmath11(@xmath1c@xmath4o ) = 1.41 ( @xmath5 0.22 ) @xmath15 10@xmath4 @xmath18 toward x per from the same data sets used here , i.e. , a column density 5.5 @xmath5 0.9 times higher than toward @xmath14 oph ( sheffer et al .",

    "a@xmath0x _ ( 8@xmath00 ) band . although the column densities of the rarer isotopomers are derived below by using the same 4-cloud model , the resulting abundances of these species are sensitive only to the total equivalent width ( @xmath20 ) of each band , because the optical depth ( @xmath21 ) at line center is less than 1 .",
    "rotational structures of four @xmath1c@xmath3o _ a@xmath0x _ bands are now resolved : see ( 2@xmath00 ) , ( 3@xmath00 ) , ( 4@xmath00 ) , and ( 5@xmath00 ) in figure 1 . table 1 lists their laboratory wavelengths computed from term values given by @xcite , who measured vuv emission line positions for @xmath22= 0 to 9 at @xmath23 = 130,000 .",
    "the match of laboratory wavelengths with observed positions of x per absorption lines is very good , i.e. , they are consistent with the radial velocity of co along this line of sight . electric dipole oscillator strengths ( @xmath24-values ) are normally assumed to be identical for all co isotopomers",
    ". therefore , @xmath11(@xmath1c@xmath3o ) was derived by fitting the position and strength of observed bands using published @xmath24-values of @xmath1c@xmath4o @xcite . for the group of four _ a@xmath0x _ bands modeled here together ,",
    "their average @xmath24-value taken from chan et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is only 3.5% smaller than an average based on @xmath24-values recommended by @xcite .",
    "values of band @xmath20 and @xmath21[@xmath23(0 ) ] are also listed in table 1 to show that these rare species indeed have optically thin lines .",
    "all four bands were fitted simultaneously , to increase the `` signal - to - noise ratio '' of the model . in a complementary manner ,",
    "individual band fits are used to derive formal error bars for modeled parameters .",
    "the column density of @xmath1c@xmath3o is found to be 4.69 ( @xmath5 0.66 ) @xmath15 10@xmath1 @xmath18 .",
    "another free fitting parameter , the ground state excitation temperature ( @xmath25@xmath26,@xmath27@xmath28 ) , is consistent with very low rotational temperatures usually found in the vuv for co in diffuse clouds : @xmath29(@xmath1c@xmath3o ) = 3.4 ( @xmath5 1.0 ) k. for comparison , we find @xmath29 = 3.3 k and 3.7 k from the _ a@xmath0x _ ( 8@xmath00 ) bands of @xmath1c@xmath4o and @xmath6c@xmath4o , respectively , toward x per . for the @xmath30@xmath31 = 2 rotational level , we provide a 2 @xmath32 upper limit , @xmath33 @xmath34 6.2 k.    identical steps of observational reductions and data modeling were followed with spectral segments of @xmath1c@xmath2o bands , although rest wavelengths had to be computed indirectly from @xmath1c@xmath4o molecular constants , see table 1 .",
    "figure 1 presents fits of the four _ a@xmath0x _ bands of @xmath1c@xmath2o : ( 2@xmath00 ) , ( 3@xmath00 ) , ( 4@xmath00 ) , and ( 5@xmath00 ) .",
    "the measured column density of @xmath1c@xmath2o is 1.63 ( @xmath5 0.62 ) @xmath15 10@xmath1 @xmath18",
    ". a reliable determination of @xmath29 was possible only from the ( 3@xmath00 ) band , on account of the extreme weakness of the @xmath1c@xmath2o @xmath30@xmath31 @xmath35 0 lines .",
    "thus @xmath29(@xmath1c@xmath2o ) = 3.1 ( @xmath5 2.0 ) k , where twice the uncertainty from the four - band c@xmath3o model is adopted for this one - band result .",
    "note that the @xmath36 ( ground state ) rotational levels of @xmath1c@xmath2o are intrinsically split into hyperfine components , observable as radio line separations of @xmath37 3 km s@xmath38 or less ( see figure 1 of bensch et al .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath9 hyperfine splittings should be much smaller than ground state splittings , hyperfine separations for vuv transitions are of the order of 10@xmath39 km s@xmath38 , which we ignore here .",
    "as described in the last section , column densities for four co isotopomers toward x per are now available from stis spectra of _ a@xmath0x _ bands . note that vuv absorptions are confined to the narrow beam subtended by the background star , whereas radiotelescopes that are used for emission measurements have much larger beam sizes . of particular diagnostic value",
    "are the isotopomeric column density ratios and their departures from ambient isotopic ratios . in table 2",
    "we list co isotopomeric ratios derived from our data , as well as carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios that were measured for local molecular clouds and are taken from reviews by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the galactocentric distance of x per is 9% larger than that of the sun ; we assume that the material along its sight line is represented by local ism abundances .",
    "the level of isotopic fractionation is given by @xmath40 @xmath41 1 , where @xmath40 is defined as the isotopomeric ratio normalized by the corresponding isotopic ratio . from table 2",
    "we get @xmath40(12,13 ) @xmath42 ( @xmath1c@xmath4o/@xmath6c@xmath4o)/(@xmath1c/@xmath6c ) = 1.0 @xmath5 0.2 , @xmath40(16,18 ) = 5.4 @xmath5 1.2 , @xmath40(16,17 ) = 4.6 @xmath5 1.9 , and @xmath40(18,17 ) = 0.9 @xmath5 0.4 .",
    "relative to @xmath1c@xmath4o , the @xmath6c@xmath4o isotopomer is unfractionated .",
    "both @xmath1c@xmath3o and @xmath1c@xmath2o are quite severely fractionated but by similar factors such that @xmath40(18,17 ) is consistent with unity within the errors of measurement .",
    "the line of sight through the translucent ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath43 @xmath44 1.44 mag ) cloud toward x per harbors a total co column density of 1.43 @xmath15 10@xmath4 @xmath18 , which is one of the larger values observed in the vuv to date , but certainly is much smaller ( by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude ) than column densities commonly observed via radio emission in molecular clouds .",
    "co photochemistry in diffuse and translucent clouds has been studied theoretically in many papers , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium co abundance is dependent in large part on photodissociation driven by absorption of ultraviolet photons in bound - bound transitions to excited states from which predissociation occurs .",
    "multiple electronic transitions are involved in the dissociation .",
    "calculation of the photodissociation rate depends , of course , on the adopted interstellar radiation field , @xmath45 , and the penetration of the ultraviolet photons into a cloud .",
    "this latter process is affected by the ultraviolet opacity of the embedded dust grains and by @xmath21 in the co `` photodissociating '' lines and in overlapping h@xmath8 and h lyman lines . when @xmath21 of such key lines is large , co molecules become shielded against @xmath45 .",
    "self - shielding may occur for transitions not overlapped by hydrogen absorption .",
    "all co isotopomers are subject to photodissociation , the rate of which , @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 stands for an isotopomeric flavor ) , decreases into the cloud as molecular abundances and their opacities ( and that from grains ) build up . as a natural outcome of the preponderance of @xmath1c and @xmath4o among all carbon and oxygen isotopes , the primary isotopomer of co",
    "is subject to greater self - shielding , resulting in a steeper gradient of growing abundance into the cloud . for unshielded co molecules , e.g. , at the edge of a cloud ,",
    "the photodissociation rates of the various isotopomers are at their maximum values and effectively identical . owing to wavelength shifts between the `` photodissociating '' transitions of different isotopomers ,",
    "the dominant molecule @xmath1c@xmath4o can not fully self - shield the less abundant isotopomers .",
    "indeed , warin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) describe the shielding of rare isotopomers by @xmath1c@xmath4o as `` not efficient '' .",
    "calculations show that @xmath1c@xmath4o can be shielded from the ultraviolet over a large portion of a diffuse or translucent cloud but trace species like @xmath1c@xmath3o are almost entirely unshielded .",
    "therefore , the faster build up of @xmath1c@xmath4o with depth into the cloud is predicted to be manifested in increased fractionation because , e.g. , @xmath40(16,18 ) = @xmath48/@xmath49 @xmath35 1 .    in diffuse and translucent clouds ,",
    "carbon is predominantly ionized @xcite .",
    "consequently , the behavior of @xmath40(12,13 ) is compounded by the isotope exchange reaction @xcite , @xmath6c@xmath7 + @xmath1c@xmath4o @xmath50 @xmath6c@xmath4o + @xmath1c@xmath7 + @xmath51e(= 34.6",
    "k ) , which is very competitive with the photodissociation rate @xmath52 because its rate coefficient @xmath53 is 6.8 @xmath15 10@xmath54 @xmath55 s@xmath38 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* at @xmath56 = 80 k ) , and which is able , therefore , to enhance the abundance of @xmath6c - containing isotopomers at the expense of @xmath1c - containing isotopomers .",
    "( an analogous isotope exchange reaction involving oxygen ions , working to reduce both @xmath40(16,18 ) and @xmath40(16,17 ) , is inhibited by the fact that oxygen is predominantly neutral in these environments . )",
    "the outcome for @xmath6c@xmath4o is a compromise between the two isotope selective processes , photodissociation and isotope exchange .",
    "indeed , published photochemical models ( see more below ) do show that @xmath40(12,13 ) is expected to be @xmath371 in the outer cloud envelope even though @xmath52/@xmath49 @xmath35 1 , and remain @xmath371 until the interior parts of the cloud are reached , where photodissociation suffers great extinction and where co becomes the most abundant form of carbon instead of c@xmath7 , thus extinguishing the isotope exchange reaction .",
    "qualitatively , our measured isotopomeric ratios fit the above description of co photochemistry in translucent clouds .",
    "first , the @xmath1c@xmath4o/@xmath6c@xmath4o ratio is equal to the ambient carbon isotopic ratio .",
    "since @xmath52 is expected to be significantly higher than @xmath49 , the isotope exchange reaction must be operating in the probed regions of the clouds to effectively reduce @xmath40(12,13 ) from @xmath445.4 , the value of @xmath40(16,18 ) , to 1 .",
    "( the similarity of @xmath52 and @xmath48 is predicted by the similarity of the shielding functions of the two isotopomers , as can be seen in table 5 of van dishoeck & black 1988 . ) a different interpretation , that of a fully efficient shielding for both species , must imply that the isotope exchange reaction is not operating .",
    "such a scenario is possible only for a warm cloud with @xmath57 @xmath58 160 k , a value much higher than 20 k , as was inferred from a chemical model of the x per line of sight @xcite .",
    "second , both trace species @xmath1c@xmath2o and @xmath1c@xmath3o are underabundant relative to @xmath1c@xmath4o by a factor of @xmath375 .",
    "this suggests that neither trace species is significantly shielded .",
    "an inspection of the van dishoeck & black ( 1988 ) translucent cloud models , especially using their fig .",
    "11 of cumulative column densities ratios from model t6 , shows that @xmath40(16,18 ) does , indeed , climb up to @xmath375 some 1 pc into the cloud , where @xmath43 @xmath37 1.2 mag from cloud edge .",
    "simultaneously , the value of @xmath40(12,13 ) remains close to 1 throughout the cloud , because both isotope selective processes very nearly cancel each other .",
    "unfortunately , co column densities obtained from table 5 of van dishoek & black ( 1988 ) do not agree with our observed values , in the sense that in order to reproduce observed isotopomeric ratios , one has to pick those models with @xmath11(co ) much higher than observed . specifically , models t2 and h3 have values of @xmath43 , @xmath11(h@xmath8 ) , @xmath11(c@xmath7 ) , and @xmath11(@xmath1c@xmath4o ) that match the x per line of sight . however , the same models display values for @xmath40(12,13 ) and @xmath40(16,18 ) that are some 50% smaller than our observed values . on the other hand , whereas our isotopomeric ratios are matched by co ratios from models t4 , h4 , and h5 , the corresponding modeled co column densities for all isotopomers are 10 to 40 times higher than observed values .",
    "in fact , the high-@xmath11(co ) discrepancy is highlighted by the persistent agreement between modeled and observed @xmath11(c@xmath7 ) values .",
    "part of the discrepancy may be due to the x per line of sight passing through the cloud envelope , but not through the cloud center .",
    "such a scenario has been explored by @xcite , who showed that co ( but not c@xmath7 ) is especially sensitive to model geometry . in particular , for the same total extinction , off - center optical paths through a spherical cloud can generate @xmath11(co ) values lower by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude than values from a path that is perpendicular to a plane - parallel slab , the likes of which were employed by van dishoek & black ( 1988 ) and by warin et al .",
    "interestingly , snow et al . (",
    "1998 ) suggested that the cloud toward x per might be a dispersing remnant of a denser molecular cloud .",
    "besides not resembling a plane - parallel slab , this cloud may also pose modeling difficulties in terms of unsatisfied steady - state assumptions .",
    "likewise , it is possible to find partial agreement between the single , @xmath43 = 4.34 mag model of a translucent cloud from warin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and our results .",
    "as abundances of all co species increase into the cloud owing to enhanced uv shielding ( see their figure 7 ) , both @xmath1c@xmath4o and @xmath6c@xmath4o first reach a plateau at @xmath43 @xmath371.0 , where their mutual ratio is @xmath3770 , or @xmath40(12,13 ) @xmath370.8 , since their input carbon isotopic ratio is 90 . furthermore , at that very point into the cloud , the ratio of @xmath1c@xmath4o to @xmath1c@xmath3o stands at @xmath372000 , i.e. , @xmath40(16,18 ) @xmath374 .",
    "but in a similar fashion to the models of van dishoeck & black ( 1988 ) , predicted @xmath11(co ) values are more than 10 times higher than those observed toward x per .",
    "warin et al . ( 1996 ) also modeled individual rotational level populations for the co isotopomers , since level photodissociation rates are coupled to ground state excitation temperatures .",
    "modeled @xmath25@xmath26,@xmath27@xmath28 values are higher than our observed values , with @xmath29 @xmath37 0.1 @xmath15",
    "@xmath57 @xmath37 5 k. one possible remedy is to assume that the same ratio of @xmath29 over @xmath57 applies to the x per clouds . in that case",
    ", the observed @xmath29 value of @xmath44 3.5 k may indicate that @xmath57 is @xmath44 35 k toward x per , rather than 20 k. indeed , @xcite derived @xmath57 = 45 ( @xmath5 15 ) k from observations of c@xmath8 along this line of sight .",
    "the line of sight toward x per has provided us with a rich spectrum of _ a@xmath0x _ bands of co , allowing the first vuv detection of the rare isotopomer @xmath1c@xmath2o and the first rotationally - resolved views of both @xmath1c@xmath3o and @xmath1c@xmath2o .",
    "these detections were made possible by the superb qualities of stis as a vuv spectrometer .",
    "toward x per we find that @xmath6c@xmath4o is unfractionated with respect to @xmath1c@xmath4o owing to a balance between the rates of photodissociation and of the isotope exchange reaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of an isotope exchange reaction in the case of oxygen isotopes renders both @xmath1c@xmath3o and @xmath1c@xmath2o strongly fractionated and destroyed at the 80% level with respect to the strongly shielded @xmath1c@xmath4o . as was described above",
    ", similar isotopomeric ratios are to be found within published results from theoretical models .",
    "however , a large gap remains between observed and modeled column densities for co.    with the detection of @xmath1c@xmath2o toward x per , observers of interstellar absorption lines are left with the last two stable co isotopomers that have yet to be detected in the ultraviolet , namely , @xmath6c@xmath3o and @xmath6c@xmath2o .",
    "these are very challenging tasks at best , as the respective intrinsic abundances are expected to be and the abundance of @xmath1c@xmath2o . whereas @xmath6c@xmath3o was included in models of translucent clouds , not even a coarse grid of theoretical models exists for @xmath1c@xmath2o in translucent clouds .",
    "hopefully , the new observations of this species as reported here and of @xmath6c@xmath2o by bensch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) will provide an incentive for the inclusion of @xmath2o - bearing molecules in computer simulations .",
    "there is also a need for laboratory measurements , since the _ a@xmath0x _ bands of @xmath1c@xmath2o currently lack rigorous wavelength and perturbation analyses .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for very rapid handling of this manuscript .",

    "<S> such severe fractionation of rare species shows that both @xmath1c@xmath2o and @xmath1c@xmath3o are destroyed by photodissociation , whereas @xmath1c@xmath4o avoids destruction through self - shielding . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be contrasted with our ratio of @xmath1c@xmath4o/@xmath6c@xmath4o = 73 @xmath5 12 toward x per , which is indistinguishable from @xmath1c/@xmath6c , the result of a balance between photodissociation of @xmath6c@xmath4o and its preferential formation via the isotope exchange reaction between co and c@xmath7 . </S>"
