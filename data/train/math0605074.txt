    "<S> we compute the integral homology ( including torsion ) , the topological k - theory , and the hodge structure on cohomology of calabi - yau threefold hypersurfaces and complete intersections in gorenstein toric fano varieties . </S>",
    "<S> the methods are purely topological .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most fruitful sources of calabi - yau threefolds is hypersurfaces , or more generally complete intersections , in toric varieties . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially true since there is a proposal for the mirror of any such calabi - yau three - fold . </S>",
    "<S> usually the toric varieties associated to convex lattice polytopes are singular , causing the calabi - yau threefolds in them also to be singular , so that to get smooth calabi - yau threefolds we must resolve the ambient singularities and take the preimage in the resolution of the singular calabi - yau threefold . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done torically by the combinatorial device of taking a triangulation of the boundary of the convex lattice polytope defining the toric variety where the vertices of the triangulation are exactly the lattice points contained in the boundary of the polytope . in general </S>",
    "<S> , there will be many such triangulations of a given lattice polytope , leading to different ambient resolutions producing different families of calabi - yau threefolds associated with the original toric variety .    in spite of the existence of many different such resolutions of a given singular object , there are lattice - theoretic formulas for the hodge numbers of these resolutions expressed in terms of the lattice polytope and its polar . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the hodge numbers of all the different resolutions coming from different triangulations are the same . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs of these combinatorial formulas rely on the griffiths - dwork method of computing hodge numbers using residues of meromorphic differentials on the complement of the calabi - yau threefolds in the toric ambient space .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we study the resolution process from a more topological point of view . in the topological study of these objects , one treats both complete intersections and hypersurfaces simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows us to establish refined versions of the hodge number counts described above . by directly considering the topology and algebraic geometry of the resolutions we compare the cohomology of the resolution with the cohomology of the singular hypersurface or complete intersection . from this </S>",
    "<S> we are able to see several things . </S>",
    "<S> the image of @xmath0 of the singular object in @xmath0 of the resolution is identified with the weight 3 quotient of @xmath0 of the singular object and hence is the same for all resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of @xmath0 of the resolution is of hodge types @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is described as a sum of hodge structures , summed over the edges of the polytope . </S>",
    "<S> the hodge structure associated to an edge is the tensor product of the hodge structures on @xmath3 of a smooth curve , contained in the closure of the two - dimensional toric orbit given by that edge , with a hodge structure of type @xmath4 on the free abelian group with basis the set of lattice points interior to the edge . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the rational hodge structure on @xmath0 is independent of the choice of resolution . </S>",
    "<S> also , under the identification of @xmath5 with the tangent space to the moduli space of complex structures , the image of @xmath5 of the singular object is identified with the tangent space of so called `` polynomial deformations '' , i.e. , the subspace of deformations obtained by varying the hypersurface or complete intersection in the toric variety . </S>",
    "<S> the non - polynomial deformations are then accounted for by the curves associated to the edges of the polytope and the lattice points in the interiors of these edges . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we recover the so called `` correction term '' describing the dimension of the non - polynomial deformations directly from the resolution description .    </S>",
    "<S> it also follows from the resolution description that every class in @xmath6 of the resolution is poincar dual to a divisor , a toric divisor . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the hodge type of @xmath6 of the resolution is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to recover the combinatorial formula for the rank of this group from an understanding of the resolutions of singularities .    besides allowing us to enhance the combinatorial counts of hodge numbers to results about hodge structures and allowing us to see directly in terms of subvarieties and other topological objects the sources of these homology groups , there are other advantages to our topological approach . </S>",
    "<S> it permits us to establish results over the integers , and these of course lead to results in topological k - theory . </S>",
    "<S> since k - theory is the repository for the most refined conjectures about mirror symmetry , understanding of the integral homology and cohomology is crucial for more refined tests of mirror symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> while this paper establishes all the necessary topology results over @xmath7 in order to examine the mirror symmetry proposals ( see , for example , @xcite ) , we do not explore these issues here ; they will be taken up in another paper . </S>"
