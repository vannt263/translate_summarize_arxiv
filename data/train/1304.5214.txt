    "we develop uniform bounded error probabilistic and non  uniform deterministic algorithms of intrinsic , quasi - polynomial complexity for the point searching problem in basic semialgebraic sets and for the search of isolated local and global minimal points in polynomial optimization .",
    "the semialgebraic sets and optimization problems have to satisfy certain well motivated geometric restrictions which allow to associate with them an intrinsic _ system degree _ ( see section [ ss:2.2 ] ) that controls the complexity of our algorithms and constitutes the core of their intrinsic character .",
    "the algorithms we are going to design will become then polynomial in the length of the extrinsic description of the problem under consideration and its system degree ( we take only arithmetic operations and comparisons in @xmath6 into account at unit costs ) .",
    "the idea is that the system degree constitutes a geometric invariant which measures the intrinsic `` complexity '' of the _ concrete _ problem under consideration ( not of all problems like a worst case complexity ) . in worst case",
    "the sequential time complexity will be of order @xmath7 ( respectively @xmath4 ) , where @xmath1 is the number of variables and @xmath3 the maximal degree of the polynomials occurring in the problem description , @xmath2 their number and @xmath8 the maximal codimension of the real varieties given by the active constraints .",
    "we shall suppose that these polynomials are represented as outputs of an essentially division ",
    "free arithmetic circuit in @xmath9 $ ] of size @xmath10 ( here , we mean by essentially division - free that only divisions by rational numbers are allowed ) .",
    "the ( sequential ) complexity of our algorithms is then of order @xmath11 ( respectively @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 is the intrinsic system degree which in worst case becomes of order @xmath4 .",
    "we call this type of complexity bounds _ intrinsic _ and _ quasi - polynomial_.    for the problem of deciding the consistency of a given set of inequality constraints and of finding , in case the answer is positive , a real algebraic sample point for each connected component of the corresponding semialgebraic set , sequential time bounds of simply exponential order , e.g. @xmath14 , are exhibited in grigorev and vorobjov @xcite , canny @xcite , renegar @xcite , heintz , roy and solern @xcite , basu , pollack and roy @xcite and the book @xcite .",
    "such bounds can also be derived from efficient quantifier elimination algorithms over the reals ( @xcite ) . since two alternating blocks of quantifiers",
    "become involved , one would expect at first glance that only a @xmath15 time complexity bound could be deduced from efficient real quantifier elimination for polynomial optimization problems .",
    "but , at least for global optimization , one can do much better with an @xmath16 sequential time bound ( see @xcite , algorithm 14.46 ) . for particular global polynomial optimization problems",
    "the constant hidden in this bound can be made precise and the algorithms become implementable ( see greuet and safey el din @xcite , safey el din @xcite , greuet @xcite and jeronimo and perucci @xcite ) .",
    "accurate estimations for the minima are contained in @xcite .",
    "the main difference with our approach is that these papers contain _ extrinsic _ worst case complexity bounds whereas our bounds are _",
    "intrinsic_.    nevertheless , this article does not focus on the improvement of known worst case complexity bounds in optimization theory .",
    "our aim is to exhibit classes of point searching problems in semialgebraic sets and polynomial optimization problems where it makes sense to speak about intrinsic complexity of solution algorithms .",

    "we shall not stick on the distinction between schemes and varieties , because it will be irrelevant in the sequel .",
    "observe that this definition of dual polar varieties may be extended to the case that there is given a zariski open subset @xmath56 of @xmath23 and that @xmath22 is now the locally closed subvariety of @xmath23 given by @xmath57 in @xcite and @xcite we have introduced the notion of dual polar variety of @xmath22 and motivated by geometric arguments the calculatory definition above of these objects .",
