    "we consider linear operators of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are polynomials or rational functions in  @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes , for instance , the derivation @xmath7 or the shift operator @xmath8 .",
    "( formal definitions are given later . )",
    "operators act in a natural way on functions .",
    "they are used in computer algebra to represent the functions  @xmath9 which they annihilate , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "multiplication of operators is defined in such a way that the product of two operators acts on a function like the two operators one after the other : @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath12 is an annihilating operator for some function  @xmath9 , and if @xmath13 is any other operator , then @xmath14 is also an annihilating operator for  @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested in turning a given operator @xmath12 into a `` nicer '' one by multiplying it from the left by a suitable  @xmath13 , for two different flavors of `` nice '' .",
    "first , we consider the problem of removing factors from the leading coefficient @xmath15 of  @xmath12 .",
    "this is known as desingularization and it is needed for computing the values of @xmath9 at the roots of @xmath15 ( provided it is defined there ) .",
    "desingularization of differential operators is classical  @xcite , and for difference operators , abramov and van hoeij  @xcite give an algorithm for doing it .",
    "we give below a new proof of ( a slightly generalized version of ) their results .",
    "secondly , we consider the problem of producing left multiples with polynomial coefficients of low degree .",
    "unlike the situation for commutative polynomials , a left multiple @xmath14 of @xmath12 may have polynomial coefficients even if @xmath13 has rational function coefficients with nontrivial denominators and the polynomial coefficients of @xmath12 have no common factors . in such situations , it may happen that the degrees of the polynomial coefficients in @xmath14 are strictly less than those in  @xmath12 .",
    "this phenomenon can be exploited in the design of fast algorithms because a small increase of the order can allow for a large decrease in degree and therefore yield a smaller total size of the operator ( `` trading order for degree '' ) .",
    "degree estimates supporting this technique have been recently given for a number of different computational problems  @xcite .",
    "although limited to special situations , these estimates can overshoot by quite a lot .",
    "below we derive a general estimate for the relation between orders and degrees of left multiples of a given operator  @xmath12 from the results about desingularization .",
    "this estimate is independent of the context from which the operator  @xmath12 arose , and it is fairly accurate in examples .",
    "before discussing the general case , let us illustrate the concepts of desingularization and trading order for degree on a concrete example . consider the differential operator @xmath16[\\partial],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 . that @xmath12 is desingularizable at ( a root of ) @xmath18 means that there is some other operator @xmath19 $ ] such that @xmath14 has coefficients in @xmath20 $ ] and its leading coefficient no longer contains  @xmath21 as factor .",
    "such a @xmath13 is called a desingulariz__ing _ _ operator for @xmath12 at  @xmath21 and @xmath14 the corresponding desingulariz__ed _ _ operator . in our example , @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a desingularizing operator for @xmath12 at  @xmath21 , the desingularized operator is @xmath23 a desingularizing operator need not exist .",
    "for example , it is impossible to remove the factor @xmath24 from the leading coefficient of @xmath12 by means of desingularization . in section  [ sec : desing ]",
    "we explain how to check for a given operator @xmath12 and a factor @xmath21 of its leading coefficient whether a desingularizing operator exists , and if so , how to compute it .",
    "desingularization causes a degree drop in the leading coefficient but may affect the other coefficients of the operator in an arbitrary fashion .",
    "however , a desingularizing operator can be turned into an operator which lowers the degrees of all the coefficients . to this end , multiply @xmath13 from the left by some polynomial @xmath25 $ ] for which the coefficients of @xmath26 have low degree modulo  @xmath21 , i.e. , for which @xmath27 where @xmath28[\\partial]$ ] and @xmath29 has low degree coefficients . in our example , a good choice is @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 since @xmath14 has polynomial coefficients , so does @xmath32 this operator has degree @xmath33 , compared to @xmath34 achieved with the original desingularizing operator .",
    "there is no left multiple of @xmath12 of order  3 and degree less than  2 .",
    "there is also none of order  4 , but there does exist a left multiple of degree  1 and order  5",
    ". it can be obtained from  @xmath13 by multiplying from the left by an operator @xmath35[\\partial]$ ] of order  2 for which the coefficients of @xmath36 have low degrees modulo  @xmath37 : taking @xmath38 we have @xmath39 , where @xmath40 set @xmath41 .",
    "then , since @xmath14 has polynomial coefficients , so does @xmath42 its degree is @xmath43 .    as the factor @xmath24",
    "can not be removed from  @xmath12 , we can not hope to reduce the degree even further .",
    "we have thus found that the region of all points @xmath44 such that there is a left @xmath45$]-multiple of @xmath12 of order @xmath1 and with polynomial coefficients of degree at most  @xmath2 is given by @xmath46 .    in section  [ sec : curve ]",
    "we explain the construction of the operators @xmath47 that turn a desingularizing operator into one that lowers all the degrees as far as possible , and we give a formula that describes the points @xmath0 for which such a @xmath47 exists .",
    "in this section we discuss under which circumstances an operator  @xmath12 admits a left multiple  @xmath14 in which a factor of the leading coefficient of @xmath12 is removed .",
    "this is of interest in its own right , and will also serve as the starting point for the construction described in the following section . in view of this latter application , we cover here a slightly generalized variant of desingularization , which not only applies to the case where a factor can be completely removed , but also cases where only the multiplicity of the factor can be lowered .    in the shift case ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , consider the operator @xmath49 the factor @xmath50 in the leading coefficient can not be removed completely . yet we can find a multiple in which @xmath51 appears in the leading coefficient ( in shifted form ) with multiplicity one only .",
    "one such left multiple of @xmath12 is @xmath52    we speak in this case of a partial desingularization .",

    "we will see below that we may always assume @xmath87 , i.e. , if something can be removed at the cost of introducing new factors into the leading coefficient , then it can also be removed without introducing new factors .",
