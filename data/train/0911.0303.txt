    "the properties of nuclei at finite temperatures have attracted attention for a long time . due to a considerable amount of experimental data",
    "the main subject of the study was the thermal properties of the giant dipole resonance ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "in the astrophysical context the thermal properties of gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions are of special interest since they play a crucial role in weak - interaction mediated reactions ( electron capture , beta - decay , neutrino scattering etc . )  @xcite .",
    "for example , electron capture on iron group nuclei initiates the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star triggering supernova explosions .",
    "moreover , electron capture rates largely determine the mass of the core and thus the fate of the shock wave formed by the supernova explosion . since the strong phase space dependence makes the relevant stellar weak - interaction rates at the early stage of the collapse  when the electron chemical potential @xmath3 is of the same order as the nuclear q - values  very sensitive to the gt distributions these need to be calculated very accurately in this regime . with proceeding collapse and hence increasing density",
    ", @xmath3 grows faster than the q - values of the nuclei present in the matter composition , the capture rates become less sensitive to the details of the gt distribution and are mainly determined by the total gt strength and its centroid energy .",
    "however , forbidden transitions can no longer be neglected when @xmath3 reaches values of the order of 30 mev at core densities @xmath4 g/@xmath5  @xcite the situation is further complicated by the fact that weak - interaction processes in stellar environments take place at temperatures of the order a few hundred kev to a few mev and gt transitions occur not only from the nuclear ground state , but also from excited states .    from a microscopic point of view , there are two routes of handling gt strength distributions and weak - interaction rates at finite temperatures .",
    "one is a state - by - state evaluation of the rate by summing over boltzmann - weighted , individually determined gt strengths for the various states .",
    "the second is based on an equilibrium statistical formulation of the nuclear many - body problem . in this approach , the thermal response of a nucleus to an external perturbing field",
    "is given by the canonical ( or grand canonical ) expectation value of the corresponding transition operator . when applied to charge - exchange processes",
    "this method yields the temperature - dependent gt and first forbidden strength function that can be then used to calculate weak - interaction rates .    for @xmath6 and @xmath7-shell nuclei",
    "the first approach was originally used by fuller  et  al .",
    "@xcite who calculated stellar weak - interaction rates using the independent - particle shell - model , supplemented by experimental data , whenever available . to allow for gt transitions from nuclear excited states",
    "these authors employed the brink hypothesis .",
    "this assumes that the gt strength distribution on excited states is the same as for the ground state , only shifted by the excitation energy of the state .",
    "these rates were subsequently updated , taking into account the quenching of axial coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "modern high - performance computing capabilities combined with state - of - the - art diagonalization approaches make possible shell - model calculations of the gt strength distribution not only for the nuclear ground state , but also for the few lowest excited states .",
    "it was demonstrated  @xcite that even for the lowest excited states in the parent nucleus the brink hypothesis is valid only for the bulk of the gt strength , but is not applicable for the individual transitions to states at low - excitation energy in the daughter nucleus . taking this into account ,",
    "the weak - interaction rates based on the shell - model diagonalization approach  @xcite were derived from the individual gt distributions from the lowest excited states and from back - resonant contributions , i.e. from transitions determined from the inverse gt distributions connecting excited states in the daughter to the lowest states in the parent spectrum . however , the compilation of  @xcite applied brink s hypothesis when taking into account gt transitions from highly excited states .",
    "weak - interaction rates have also been computed using the spectral distribution theory  @xcite and the proton - neutron quasiparticle rpa model  @xcite .",
    "the first method is also based on the brink hypothesis .",
    "the latter does not use this hypothesis , but some uncertainties arise due to the approximate treatment of the parent excited states as multi - quasiparticle states as well as the insufficient knowledge of the quantum numbers of the states involved .",
    "recently stellar electron capture rates have been calculated within the framework of the finite temperature rpa using a set of skyrme interactions  @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage of consistency , however , it misses relevant correlations which , as we will demonstrate in the present paper , are crucial to derive stellar electron capture rates for neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the statistical way for the calculation of temperature - dependent gt and first - forbidden strength functions was first applied in  @xcite to study electron capture on neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the most advances realization of this way is presently performed in the framework of the shell - model monte - carlo ( smmc ) method  @xcite .",
    "it was found  @xcite that with increasing temperature the gt centroids shift to lower excitation energies and the widths of the distributions increase with the appearance of low - lying strength .",
    "both effects arise from thermally excited states , i.e. , the brink hypothesis is not supported by smmc calculations . in spite of its advantages ,",
    "the smmc method only yields the lowest moments of the gt strength distributions which introduce some inaccuracies into the rate calculations .",
    "moreover , the smmc method has restrictions in its applicability to odd - odd and odd - a nuclei at low temperatures .",
    "thus , the problem of an accurate description of the gt strength distribution at finite temperatures and reliable estimates of stellar weak - interaction rates is not solved completely yet : the shell - model diagonalization approach allows for detailed spectroscopy , but partially employs the brink hypothesis .",
    "the smmc method is free from this disadvantage , but can not provide a detailed strength distribution . moreover , present computer capabilities allow the application of the shell - model diagonalization method only to nuclei in the iron region ( @xmath8 ) , whereas the smmc approach can in principle be applied to all nuclei . however , such calculations are rather time - consuming and have therefore been limited to about 200 nuclei with mass numbers @xmath9  @xcite , while weak processes in more massive and neutron - rich nuclei also play an important role in various astrophysical scenarios .",
    "therefore , alternative methods to deal with gamow - teller strength distributions and weak - interaction rates at finite temperatures are desirable .",
    "in this paper we study the temperature dependence of the gamow - teller strength applying the proton - neutron quasiparticle rpa  @xcite extended to finite temperature by the thermo - field - dynamics ( tfd ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "this technique has the advantage that it does not rely on brink s hypothesis .",
    "the energies of the gt transitions and corresponding transition strengths are calculated as functions of the nuclear temperature . in this paper",
    ", we apply this method for the calculations of weak - interaction rates on iron group nuclei and neutron - rich nuclei beyond @xmath7-shell .",
    "however , this method is not only restricted to these nuclei but can be applied to heavier nuclei as well . in addition , it allows calculations of the strength distributions for forbidden transitions which contribute significantly to weak - interaction rates at high densities .",
    "although , in the present paper , we restrict our study to the one - phonon approach , the method can be extended to higher phonon admixtures thus yielding more detailed strength distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] , some important features of the tfd formalism with application to the nuclear structure problem at finite temperatures are presented .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "as a method to study a thermal behavior of quantum many - body systems the tfd method has two attractive features : a ) temperature effects arise explicitly as @xmath11-dependent vertices , providing a convenient starting point for various approximations ; b ) temperature and time are independent variables .",
    "the first feature allows for straightforward extensions of well - established zero - temperature approximations .",
    "it has been employed previously in  @xcite where selected nuclear structure problems at finite temperatures were considered .",
    "the standard tfd formalism treats a many - particle system in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath and a particle reservoir in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the thermal average of a given operator @xmath12 is calculated as the expectation value in a specially constructed , temperature - dependent state @xmath13 , which is termed the thermal vacuum .",
    "this expectation value is equal to the usual grand canonical average of @xmath12 .    to construct the state @xmath13 ,",
    "a formal doubling of the system degrees of freedom is introduced . in tfd ,",
    "a tilde conjugate operator  @xmath14  acting in the independent hilbert space  is associated with @xmath12 , in accordance with properly formulated tilde conjugation rules  @xcite . for a system governed by the hamiltonian  @xmath15 the whole hilbert space",
    "is now spanned by the direct product of the eigenstates of  @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and those of the tilde hamiltonian  @xmath17 , both having the same eigenvalues ( @xmath18 ) . in the doubled hilbert space",
    ", the thermal vacuum is defined as the zero - energy eigenstate of the so - called thermal hamiltonian @xmath19 and it satisfies the thermal state condition  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 for bosonic  @xmath12 and @xmath22 for fermionic @xmath12 .",
    "the important point is that in the doubled hilbert space the time - translation operator is not the initial hamiltonian  @xmath15 , but the thermal hamiltonian  @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the excitations of the thermal system are obtained by the diagonalization of  @xmath24 .",
    "as it follows from the definition of @xmath25 each of its eigenstates with positive energy has a counterpart  the tilde - conjugate eigenstate  with negative energy , but the same absolute value .",
    "this is a way to treat excitation- and de - excitation processes at finite temperatures within tfd .    obviously , in most of practical cases one can not diagonalize @xmath25 exactly .",
    "usually , one resorts to certain approximations such as the hartree - fock bogoliubov mean field theory ( hfb ) and the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in",
    "what follows the formal part of the tfd studies for charge - exchange excitations in hot nuclei is based in part on the results of  @xcite .    in our present study",
    "we use a phenomenological nuclear hamiltonian consisting of a static mean field , bcs pairing interactions and separable multipole and spin - multipole particle - hole interactions , including isoscalar and isovector parts .",
    "this is usually referred to as the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm )  @xcite .",
    "it was used to study the charge - exchange excitations in nuclei at zero temperature in  @xcite . in principle",
    ", the qpm formalism enables one to go beyond the qrpa and take into account the coupling of quasiparticles and phonons . at finite temperatures",
    "this coupling was considered in  @xcite . however , in the present study we restrict ourselves to the thermal qrpa .",
    "the main line of the present discussion is very similar to the qpm at @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the thermal hamiltonian , which reads as @xmath27 the first step in the approximate diagonalization of @xmath28 is the treatment of the pairing correlations .",
    "this is done by two successive unitary transformations .",
    "the first is the usual bogoliubov @xmath29 transformation from the original particle operators @xmath30 to the quasiparticle ones @xmath31 .",
    "the same transformation is applied to tilde operators @xmath32 , thus producing the tilde quasiparticle operators @xmath33 .",
    "the second transformation is the so - called thermal bogoliubov transformation  @xcite .",
    "it mixes the quasiparticle and tilde quasiparticle operators , thus producing thermal quasiparticle operators and their tilde partners : @xmath34 .",
    "we use ojima s  @xcite complex form of the thermal bogoliubov transformation @xmath35 the reasons for this are given in  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 are found by diagonalizing  @xmath37 and demanding that the vacuum of thermal quasiparticle obeys the thermal state condition  .",
    "this is equivalent to the minimization of the thermodynamic potential for bogoliubov quasiparticles . as a result one obtains the following equations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40^{-1/2},\\    x_j=\\bigl(1-y^2_j\\bigr)^{1/2 } , \\label{x&y}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the isospin quantum number @xmath43 .",

    "( [ bcs ] ) it is found that the ( pseudo)critical temperature is @xmath49 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in accordance with the bcs theory .    with the coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath51 , defined by eqs .",

    "some remarks are in order .",
    "tqrpa equations for gt excitations at finite temperature were also derived in  @xcite .",
    "they were obtained using the equation of motion method by replacing vacuum expectation values by thermal averages , i.e. , without applying the tfd formalism and doubling the hilbert space .",

    "neutrinos escape freely from the interior of the star .",
    "hence no pauli blocking for neutrinos is considered in the final state .",

    "this virtue makes it conceptually superior to the hybrid approach of smmc+rpa which has previously been used to estimate such rates for neutron - rich nuclei . in the present application of the model",
    "we have done a first step towards its complete realization describing correlations within the tqrpa .",
    "while this already recovers much of the essential physics , the detailed comparison to shell model results implies that the model must be extended to include correlations beyond tqrpa .",
