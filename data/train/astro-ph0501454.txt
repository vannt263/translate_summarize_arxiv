    "theories unifying gravity with other interactions suggest a possibility of temporal and spatial variation of fundamental constants of nature . a review of these theories and measurement results can be found in @xcite .",
    "a very sensitive many - multiplet ( mm ) method to search for the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath0 by comparison of quasar absorption spectra with laboratory spectra has been suggested in ref @xcite .",
    "it requires calculations of relativistic corrections to atomic energy levels which allow one to find dependence of atomic transition frequencies on @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the laboratory values , @xmath10 and @xmath5 are the rest value of transition frequency and the fine structure constant for an atom or ion in a remote cloud of ionized gas located on a distance up to 12 billion light years from us .",
    "calculations of @xmath4 for a number of atomic transitions have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite used mm method @xcite and found possible evidence of @xmath5 variation , while other groups @xcite have used the same method @xcite but found no indications of the variation ( note , however , that works @xcite are based on data from keck telescope located in northern hemisphere while works @xcite used data from very large telescope located in southern hemisphere .",
    "therefore , the disagreement between the results , in principle , may be attributed to the spatial variation of @xmath5 . ) .    to improve these results",
    "it would be very important to include into data analysis new atomic transitions where possible effects of @xmath5 variation are larger . indeed , now systematic effects are at most comparable to the observed frequency shifts corresponding to value of @xmath11 reported in @xcite . if transitions with an order of magnitude larger values of @xmath4 will be used these systematic effects will be negligible in comparison with the frequency shifts produced by @xmath12 .",
    "coefficients @xmath4 are small in light atoms and rapidly increase ( @xmath13 ) with nuclear charge @xmath2 .",
    "recently transitions in heavy ions ge ii ( @xmath14 , rest wavelength 1602.4863 a ) , sn ii ( @xmath15 , rest wavelength 1400.450 a ) and pb ii ( @xmath16 , rest wavelength 1433.9056 a ) have been observed in quasar absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present work we perform calculations of the dependence of transition frequencies on @xmath5 in ge ii , sn ii and pb ii .",
    "coefficients @xmath4 in pb ii are an order of magnitude larger than in lighter elements ( @xmath17 ) which were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . potentially , this may give an order of magnitude increase of sensitivity to @xmath5 variation and help to eliminate possible disagreement between the results of different groups .",
    "note that only e1 transitions from the ground states are observed in quasar absorption spectra .",
    "calculations for ge  ii , sn  ii and pb  ii are difficult due to strong configuration mixing and level pseudo - crossing . as it was pointed out in our previous works energies of different atomic states considered as functions of @xmath3 may have very different slopes and come to crossing at particular values of @xmath5 @xcite . since there can be no real crossing of levels with the same conserving quantum numbers the phenomenon",
    "is called level pseudo - crossing .",
    "configurations are strongly mixed and the slope of curve representing @xmath18 change very quickly in the vicinity of level pseudo - crossing . if this happens near physical value of @xmath5 ( @xmath19 ) the results for the coefficients @xmath4 ( see eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ) become unstable since small error in a position of level crossing results in a large error in @xmath4 .",
    "one way of dealing with this problem is by fitting the experimental values of the land @xmath20-factors @xcite .",
    "when states of different total angular momentum @xmath21 and total spin @xmath22 are mixed the resulting values of @xmath20-factors depend on configuration mixing similar to @xmath4-coefficients ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the weight of a state @xmath26 ) . therefore",
    ", correcting the mixing coefficients to fit the experimental @xmath20-factors helps to find true values of the @xmath4-coefficients as well .",
    "however , in the case of ions considered in present work , there is strong configuration mixing between states of the same @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath28 is the total momentum ) .",
    "these states are the @xmath29 states of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 configurations ( @xmath32 for ge  ii , @xmath33 for sn  ii and @xmath34 for pb  ii ) .",
    "the mixed states have the same values of @xmath20-factors and resulting @xmath20-factor does not depend on configuration mixing .",
    "in contrast , the values of @xmath4-coefficients are still sensitive to configuration mixing .    in principle , it is possible to use experimental hyperfine structure ( hfs ) to fit the configuration mixing coefficients . since single - electron matrix elements of the hyperfine interaction",
    "have very different values for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 states , different configurations must have different values of the many - electron hfs matrix element .",
    "therefore , fitting the experimental hfs would have the same effect as fitting of experimental @xmath20-factors .",
    "unfortunately , no experimental data on hfs is available for ge  ii , sn  ii and pb  ii .    this leaves us with energies being the only control of the accuracy of calculation of the @xmath4-coefficients ( with exception of few levels of pb  ii where @xmath20-factors are also useful ) .",
    "calculations need to be done to very high accuracy for the energies to be a reliable control .",
    "the criterion is that deviation of the calculated energies from the experimental values must be much smaller than the experimental energy interval between mixed states .",
    "the interval between different @xmath38 states of ge  ii ,",
    "sn  ii and pb  ii is a little larger than 10000  @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the deviation of the calculated energies from the experiment should be less than @xmath40 1000  @xmath39 or @xmath41  1% of the excitation energy from the ground state .",
    "a method which can produce the results of desirable accuracy was suggested in ref .",
    "calculations are done in the @xmath42 approximation .",
    "this means that the self - consistent hartree fock procedure is done for the quadruply charged positive ion . as it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , removal of @xmath35 and @xmath36 valence electrons does nt really affect the atomic core ( apart from singe - electron energies ) and @xmath42 approximation is a good approximation for all ions with number of valence electrons ranges from 1 to 5 .",
    "these include neutral atom and negative ion .",
    "the main advantage of this approximation is that core - valence correlations can be relatively easy included beyond the second - order of the perturbation theory .",
    "as it has been demonstrated in ref  @xcite inclusion of higher - order core - valence correlations can significantly improve the accuracy of calculations .",
    "the ions of our current interest have three valence electrons and the effective hamiltonian for the three - electron wave function of valence electrons has the form @xmath43 @xmath44 is the one - electron part of the hamiltonian @xmath45 @xmath46 is the single - electron operator ( correlation potential ) which describes correlations between a particular valence electron and core electrons .",
    "it is the same operator which is used for atoms and ions with one external electron above closed shells ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath47 is the two - electron part of the hamiltonian @xmath48 @xmath49 is the two - electron part of core - valence correlations .",
    "it represents screening of coulomb interaction between valence electrons by core electrons .",
    "note that removing @xmath50 from the effective hamiltonian reduces it to the effective hamiltonian of the standard configuration interaction ( ci ) method .",
    "since we use many - body perturbation theory to calculate @xmath50 the technique we use can be called the ci+mbpt method @xcite .",
    "the details of calculations for positive ions of ge , sn and pb will be presented elsewhere .",
    "below we discuss specifics of calculations for ge  ii , sn  ii and pb  ii .      the ge  ii ion is the lightest of three ions ( @xmath2=32 ) and the easiest from computational point of view .",
    "the core - valence correlations are relatively small due to small number of electrons in the core .",
    "the relativistic corrections are small too .",
    "the latter means in particular that fine structure is small and energy multiplets stay well apart from each other and there is no level pseudo - crossing .",
    "also , there is almost no mixing between states of different total angular momentum @xmath21 and/or different total spin @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath51 states of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 configurations are still strongly mixed . however ,",
    "due to high accuracy of the calculations the final results are very stable .",
    "we calculate @xmath46 and @xmath49 for the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) in the second order of the mbpt .",
    "inclusion of @xmath46 brings single - electron energies of ge  iv to agreement with the experiment on the level of 0.1% .",
    "no higher - order core - valence correlations need to be included .",
    "the final results are presented in table  [ geii ] .",
    "to calculate @xmath4-coefficients ( see eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) ) we perform calculations of the energies for @xmath54 . than @xmath55 and finally @xmath56 .",
    "we need both @xmath57 and @xmath58 to check for non - linear behavior of energies which is usually an indicator of the level pseudo crossing . for ge  ii @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "are practically identical for all levels considered .",
    ".[geii]energy levels and relativistic energy shift of ge  ii ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we used combination of the many - body perturbation theory and configuration interaction method to calculate dependence of the energy levels on the fine - structure constant ( @xmath4-coefficients ) .",
    "this dependence is due to the dirac relativistic corrections ( which are strongly modified by the many - body effects ) .",
    "as we found in our previous works the breit interaction and qed radiative corrections are not important for the atoms of interest .",
    "calculations in ge ii and sn ii are straightforward and dependence of the transition frequencies on @xmath59 is close to the linear one ( @xmath60 ) . the accuracy of the energy level calculation in ge ii and sn ii is better than 1% , for the fine structure intervals the accuracy is better than 3% .",
    "therefore , the errors in @xmath4 should not exceed 3% .",
    "the levels where @xmath4 are anomalously small may be an exception .",
    "for example , a conservative estimate of accuracy for the level with @xmath61 @xmath39 in ge ii where @xmath62 @xmath39 is better than 10% .",
    "the value of @xmath4 for this level ( @xmath63 @xmath39 ) was also calculated in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the present calculation is more accurate .",
    "the case of pb ii is more complicated due to the level pseudo - crossing ( as functions of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath3 is highly non - linear ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "however , after taking into account the experimental information about the @xmath20-factors and intervals between energy levels the errors in @xmath4-values are reduced to @xmath64 .",
    "the values of @xmath4 in sn ii and especially pb ii are much larger than in the elements which were previously used to search for @xmath5 variation where @xmath65 @xmath39 . for the detected transitions @xcite ge ii ( @xmath14 , rest wavelength 1602.4863 a ) @xmath66 @xmath39 , sn ii ( @xmath15 , rest wavelength 1400.450 a ) @xmath67 @xmath39 , and pb ii ( @xmath16 , rest wavelength 1433.9056 a ) @xmath68 @xmath39 .",
    "the largest ( in absolute value ) calculated @xmath4-coefficient in pb ii is @xmath69  @xmath39",
    ". this may give significant increase in sensitivity to the variation of @xmath5 .",
