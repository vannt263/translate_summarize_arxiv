    "there is currently an unfortunate dichotomy in analytical approaches to qcd .",
    "one either calculates using lagrangian methods and , with the exception of monte carlo simulations , is limited to perturbative calculations , or one employs low energy models of qcd and eschews the known high energy behavior of the theory .",
    "there are only a few approaches where , for example , the calculation of hadronic form factors may be connected to the expected quark counting behavior at high energies .",
    "these include qcd sum rules  @xcite , nrqcd  @xcite , and to some extent light cone quantization  @xcite .",
    "this paper develops a formalism by which the known high energy behavior of qcd ( pqcd ) may be rigorously joined to standard phenomenological models of hadrons .",
    "this is achieved by using the renormalization group to run the scale of the qcd hamiltonian to the hadronic regime where it smoothly joins a fixed phenomenological behavior .",
    "this approach imposes important constraints on the low energy portion of the model .",
    "if one wishes to recover pqcd , one must work with current quarks .",
    "thus the low energy theory must also deal with current quarks .",
    "however phenomenology indicates that constituent quarks are the relevant degrees of freedom at low energy .",
    "thus , one must allow for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the model .",
    "this , in turn , means that a nontrivial vacuum must be incorporated into the theory .",
    "finally , we see that one must use many - body techniques when calculating observables .",
    "the hamiltonian - based renormalization group we employ is particularly useful in this regard because it allows for the use of nonperturbative many - body techniques .",
    "we call this approach the `` dynamical quark model '' ( dqm ) .",
    "the fact that the low energy behavior of the dqm evolves directly from pqcd is very helpful when analyzing the dynamical structure of the low energy portion of the model .",
    "for example , we are able to rigorously establish that the non - abelian coulomb interaction is responsible for the quark structure of confinement in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we are also able to resolve ambiguities in the separation of short and long distance phenomena when evaluating current matrix elements .",
    "this brings us to a final important reason for employing the renormalization group improved ( rgi ) hamiltonian .",
    "as stated , we are obliged to use many - body methods while working with the model .",
    "the major tools at our disposal are the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) and the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "these build , for example , meson bound states of the type @xmath0 or @xmath1 respectively . if one wants to allow for mixing to , for example , @xmath2 or @xmath3 states then these must be explicitly included in the calculation .",
    "such coupled channel problems are rather difficult to solve .",
    "thus it is imperative to include as much of the physics of fock sector mixing as possible directly into the hamiltonian .",
    "for example , the phenomenologically important hyperfine splittings can be incorporated by iterating the @xmath2 vertex , thereby adding an effective transverse gluon exchange operator to the hamiltonian .",
    "using the rgi hamiltonian automatically achieves this goal .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . a model based on the coulomb gauge qcd hamiltonian",
    "is introduced in section ii and its high energy behavior is analyzed .",
    "to do this we impose a chiral invariant regulator and then calculate the rgi hamiltonian .",
    "the counter - term structure and possible perturbative and nonperturbative renormalization schemes are then discussed . in section iii",
    "we show how effective operators are constructed and examine the ultraviolet behavior of the quark creation operator , the axial current , and the scalar quark density .",
    "section iv presents nonperturbative , one - loop , many - body calculations of the vacuum gap equation , the quark condensate , and the dynamical quark mass .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "our starting point will be the coulomb gauge hamiltonian of qcd .",
    "there are many reasons for choosing to work in the coulomb gauge .",
    "for example , as stated in the introduction , it is expedient to have explicit @xmath4 interactions in the hamiltonian to make a connection with quark model phenomenology .",
    "further advantages of the coulomb gauge are that all unphysical degrees of freedom have been eliminated so that subsidiary conditions on states are not necessary .",
    "this also implies that the norm is positive definite .",
    "furthermore , spurious retardation effects are minimized .",
    "we note that it is impossible to address the issue of gauge invariance in this model because it is defined in a specific gauge . however , qcd is gauge invariant so it is perfectly acceptable to work in a fixed gauge .",
    "the real issue is not how the model changes under a gauge transformation , but how well the phenomenological low energy interaction @xmath5 we will use mimics the actual low energy behavior of qcd .",
    "the only way to address this is to solve qcd ( on the lattice , say ) or to compare the predictions of the model to observables",
    ". this will be the subject of future papers .",
    "for now , we note that lattice gauge theory indicates that @xmath5 should be a linear potential when the quarks are static , our predicted glueball spectrum agrees well with lattice calculations@xcite , and the model is guaranteed to reproduce the success of the naive quark model for heavy quarks .",
    "the dqm hamiltonian is obtained after a rather long series of operations .",
    "the first step is to regulate the bare hamiltonian in a manner which is consistent with the renormalization scheme we shall employ and which does not interfere with the nonperturbative calculations we will eventually perform .",
    "this introduces a scale into the hamiltonian which we shall call @xmath6 .",
    "renormalization is carried out by performing a similarity transformation on the hamiltonian .",
    "this transformation is designed to eliminate couplings between the scale @xmath6 and an arbitrary , but nearby , lower scale @xmath7 .",
    "the similarity transformation preserves the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( to the order we work to ) while restricting the matrix elements of the hamiltonian to a smaller , band - diagonal form .",
    "since elimination of these couplings reveals uv divergences in the bare hamiltonian the third step is to absorb these by fixing appropriate counter - terms .",
    "after this we repeat the last two steps above , thereby generating a renormalization group improved effective hamiltonian .",
    "the final step of our program is to include a phenomenological term which is meant to model the behavior of the higher order terms that have been ignored in the perturbative analysis .      as mentioned above , our starting point is the coulomb gauge hamiltonian of qcd @xcite ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the free hamiltonian ,    @xmath10\\psi(\\x )   + tr \\int d\\x \\left[\\bbox{\\pi}^2(\\x ) + { \\bf b}_{\\cal a}^2(\\x)\\right ] .",

    "usually the effective hamiltonian is constructed by dividing the hilbert space into two portions which are defined by projection operators , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . in general the effective hamiltonian may be written as a sum of the projected hamiltonian , @xmath22 and a set of effective interactions , @xmath23 arising from elimination of couplings between the @xmath20 and @xmath24 spaces .",
    "typical methods for constructing the effective hamiltonian produce energy denominators in @xmath23 which may vanish .",
    "this introduces severe complications when attempting to nonperturbatively diagonalize the effective hamiltonian .",
    "an elegant way for avoiding these problems is given by the similarity transformation scheme of gazek and wilson @xcite .",

    "<S> a model which combines the perturbative behavior of qcd with low energy phenomenology in a unified framework is developed . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by applying a similarity transformation to the qcd hamiltonian which removes interactions between the ultraviolet cutoff and an arbitrary lower scale . </S>",
    "<S> iteration then yields a renormalization group improved effective hamiltonian at the hadronic energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure preserves the standard ultraviolet behavior of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the hamiltonian evolves smoothly to a phenomenological low energy behavior below the hadronic scale . </S>",
    "<S> this method has the benefit of allowing radiative corrections to be directly incorporated into nonperturbative many - body techniques . </S>",
    "<S> it is applied to coulomb gauge qcd supplemented with a low energy linear confinement interaction . a nontrivial vacuum is included in the analysis via a bogoliubov - valatin transformation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the formalism is applied to the vacuum gap equation , the quark condensate , and the dynamical quark mass . </S>"
