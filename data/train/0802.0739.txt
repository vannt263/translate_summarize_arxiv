    "flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes induced by @xmath6 transitions are not allowed at tree level in the standard model ( sm ) , but are generated at loop level and are further suppressed by the ckm factors .",
    "therefore , these decays are very sensitive to the physics beyond the sm via the influence of new particles in the loop . though the branching ratios of fcnc  decays are small in the sm , quite interesting results are obtained from the experiments both for the inclusive @xmath7 @xcite and exclusive decay modes @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates @xcite .    among different semileptonic",
    "decays induced by @xmath6 transitions , @xmath10 decays are of particular interest , because of the absence of a photonic penguin contribution and hadronic long distance effects these have much smaller theoretical uncertainties . but experimentally , it is too difficult to measure the inclusive decay modes @xmath11 as one has to sum on all the @xmath12 s",
    ". therefore , the exclusive @xmath13 decays play a peculiar role both from the experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "the theoretical estimates of the branching ratio of these decays are @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite whereas , the experimental bounds given by the @xmath2-factories , belle and babar , on these decays are @xcite : @xmath16these processes , based on @xmath17 are very sensitive to the new physics and have been studied extensively in the literature in the context of large extra dimension model and @xmath18 models 12 , 13 . any new physics model which can provide a relatively light new source of missing energy ( which is attributed to the neutrinos in the sm )",
    "can potentially enhance the observed rates of @xmath19 missing energy .",
    "recently , h. georgi has proposed one such model of unparticles , which is one of the tantalizing issues these days @xcite .",
    "the main idea of georgi s model is that at a very high energy our theory contains the fields of the standard model and the fields of a theory with a nontrivial  ir fixed point , which he called bz ( banks - zaks ) fields @xcite .",
    "the interaction among the two sets is through the exchange of particles with a large mass scale @xmath20 .",
    "the coupling between the sm fields and bz fields are nonrenormalizable below this scale and are suppressed by the powers of @xmath20 .",
    "the renormalizable couplings of the bz fields then produce dimensional transmutation and the scale invariant unparticle emerged below an energy scale @xmath21 . in the effective theory below the scale @xmath21 the bz operators matched onto unparticle operators , and the renormalizable interaction matched onto a new set of interactions between standard model and unparticle fields .",
    "the outcome of this model is the collection of unparticle stuff with scale dimension @xmath5 , which is just like a non - integral number of invisible massless particles , whose production might be detectable in missing energy and momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "this idea promoted a lot of interest in unparticle physics and its signatures have been discussed at colliders @xcite , in low energy physics @xcite , lepton flavor violation @xcite , unparticle physics effects in @xmath22 mixing @xcite , and also in cosmology and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "aliev et al . have studied @xmath23 missing energy in unparticle physics @xcite in which they have studied the effects of an unparticle @xmath0 as a possible source of a missing energy in these decays .",
    "they have found the dependence of the differential branching ratio on the @xmath24-meson s energy in the presence of scalar and vector unparticle operators and then using the upper bounds on these decays , they put stringent constraints on the parameters of the unparticle stuff .    the studies are even more complete if similar studies for the p - wave decays of @xmath2 meson such as @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is missing energy ) and @xmath27 , where @xmath28  and @xmath29 are the pseudoscalar and axial vector mesons respectively , carried out . in this paper , we have studied these p - wave decays of @xmath2 meson in unparticle physics using the frame work of aliev et al .",
    "we have considered the decay @xmath30 in sm although for these modes no signals have been observed so for , but in future b - factories where enough data is expected , these decays will be observed .",
    "these superb factories will be measuring these processes by analyzing the spectra of the final state hadron .",
    "in doing this measurement a cut for high momentum on the hadron is imposed , in order to suppress the background .",
    "therefore , unparticle would give us a unique distribution for the high energy hadron in the final state , such that in future b - factories one will be able to distinguish the presence of unparticle by observing the spectrum of final state hadrons in @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section ii after giving the expression for the effective hamiltonian for the decay @xmath10 , we define the scalar and vector unparticle physics operators for @xmath32 . then using these expressions we calculate the various contributions the decay rates of @xmath33 both from the sm and unparticle theory in section iii . recently , grinstein et al",
    ". gave comments on the unparticle @xcite mentioning that mack s unitarity constraint lower bounds on cft operator dimensions , e.g @xmath34 for primary , gauge invariant , vector unparticle operators . to account for this",
    "they have corrected the results in the literature , and modified the propagator of vector and tensor unparticles .",
    "we will also give the expressions of decay rate using these modified vector operators in the same section .",
    "finally , section iv contains our numerical results and conclusions .",
    "the flavor changing neutral current @xmath10 are of particular interest both from theoretical and experimental view .",
    "one of the main reason of interest is the absence of long distance contribution related to the four - quark operators in the effective hamiltonian . in this respect ,",
    "the transition to neutrino represents a clean process even in comparison with the @xmath35 decay , where long - distance contributions , though small , are expected to present @xcite . in standard model",
    "these processes are governed by the effective hamiltonian    @xmath36    where @xmath37 are the elements of the cabbibo - kobayashi maskawa matrix and @xmath38 is obtained from the @xmath39 penguin and box diagrams where the dominant contribution corresponds to a top quark intermediate state and it is @xmath40@xmath41 is the weinberg angle and @xmath42 is the usual inami - lim function , given as @xmath43with @xmath44 .    the unparticle transition at the quark level can be described by @xmath32 , where one can consider the following operators :    * scalar unparticle operator @xmath45 * vector unparticle operator @xmath46    the propagator for the scalar unparticle field can be written as@xcite @xmath47with @xmath48",
