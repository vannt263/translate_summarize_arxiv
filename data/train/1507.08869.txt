    "probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of column density @xmath7(hi+h@xmath8 ) obtained using far - infrared emission of dust from _ herschel _ show a characteristic shape for low - mass star - forming regions : a lognormal distribution for low @xmath7 , commonly attributed to turbulence , and a single power - law tail for higher @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "additional extinction due to foreground / background emission provokes that the width of the lognormal part becomes more narrow and the peak shifts to higher a@xmath0 , while the slope(s ) of the power - law tail(s ) are steeper , compared to an undisturbed distribution @xcite .",
    "however , the slope of the second power - law tail is less affected because a contamination of a few a@xmath0  does not significantly change the highest column densities . contamination and projection effects , however , could still lead to substructure in the pdf , which might complicate the simple lognormal + power - law tail(s ) representation .",

    "these central regions correspond in their geometry and physical properties to what was defined as ridges ( or hubs ) in massive clouds @xcite , i.e. , regions with high column density ( @xmath2610@xmath27 @xmath23 ) over small areas .",
    "the pacs 70 @xmath9 m images ( fig .",

    "* ) , monr2 hosts several uc hii  regions and bipolar outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and cepob3 includes an embedded massive cluster .",
    "table  [ table ] lists the masses contained above the two break points . for the high column density regime ( yellow ) , we determine also the equivalent radius @xmath28 , and the density @xmath29 .",
    "it becomes obvious that most of the mass is constituted by the lower column density regime , i.e. , 83% , 61% , and 68% for cepob3 , monr2 , and ngc6334 , respectively .",
    "the mass above the first deviation point makes up 15% to 39% of the complexes",
    ". the highest column density clumps still account for a significant amout of mass in monr2 and ngc6334 ( both 15% ) , but a much smaller proportion ( @xmath301% ) for cepob3 .",
    "the average density @xmath31 in these clumps is also high , i.e. , between 2@xmath1110@xmath5 @xmath6 and 3.5@xmath1110@xmath32 @xmath6 .",
    "however , the existence of high density clumps / cores does not by itself explain the second power law . in a region such as aquila , @xmath115% of the total cloud mass",
    "resides in gas of density larger than 10@xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite , but only a single power - law tail is observed @xcite .",
    "+ we focus now on the analysis of the two power - law tails . from the slope @xmath33 , the exponent @xmath2 for the density distribution @xmath34 can be derived . for a spherical geometry , representing clumps and cores , @xmath35 @xcite . for a cylindrical one , characterizing filaments , @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "table  1 lists the values for both geometries for the first and second tail .",
    "the values of @xmath2 for the first tail range between 1.3 and 2 , consistent with free - fall collapse , see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed discussion of both filaments and clumps / cores .",
    "the values of @xmath37 between 1.85 and 2.64 correspond very well to the range of values directly measured for the b211/b213 filament in taurus in @xcite .",
    "independent observational support for gravitational contraction comes from molecular line observations of other gmcs that show spectral infall signatures across ridges @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the formation of high - mass stars requires a very large mass accretion rate , provided by infall from merging filaments and gravitational collapse of larger structures on parsec - scales . for the excess  presuming it can be described by a power - law ",
    "@xmath2 lies between 1.9 and 4.2 .",
    "the assumption of a spherical density distribution is probably more valid here , because the corresponding regions are more compact and circular .",
    "however , free - fall alone can not produce @xmath42 , only a slowed - down collapse can lead to piling up high ( column ) densities on very small spatial scales .",
    "the pdf excess we observe for the gmcs in our study is not a systematic property of all gmcs .",
    "it is also seen in rosette @xcite , w43 and w51 ( schneider et al . , in prep . ) , and w3 ( rivera - ingraham et al . , 2015 ) , but there is no example of a low - mass star - forming cloud that displays this feature . similarly , there are also massive clouds such as carina and ngc3603 @xcite , vela @xcite , or m16 @xcite where no clear indication for this excess is found in the pdfs of the whole cloud .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the excess is caused by a systematic bias introduced during the determination of the dust column density maps .",
    "it is out of the scope of this paper to discuss in detail the general uncertainties related to the determination of the column density maps and we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we mention here briefly the biases that could potentially influence the inferred slope and are thus relevant for the results of this paper : 1 ) an overestimation of the line - of - sight temperature ( assumed to be constant for the sed fit ) leads to an underestimation of the column density ( and the vice versa ) .",
    "2 ) if dust opacity increases towards high column densities , then this could give rise to a steeper slope of the power - law tail at higher densities .",
    "3 ) the adopted value of the specific dust opacity @xmath15=2 could be too high in parts of the warm gmcs .",
    "a lower ( higher ) value of @xmath15 in the greybody fits leads to higher temperatures and thus lower ( higher ) column densities .",
    "given that the excess / second power - law tail is only found in high - density ( @xmath3810@xmath39 @xmath6 ) star - forming clumps on size scales of @xmath11 pc , i.e. in ridges / hubs , the physical process(es ) in control of it must be active on small scales .",
    "it is evident that at these densities gravitational collapse of individual star - forming cores is involved , but it is not yet understood what produces the remarkable excess in column density .",
    "we emphasize that in all cases the newly found excess is preceeded by a first power - law in the pdf consistent with the dominant effect of self - gravity found by numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we thus expect the regions under consideration to contract in almost free - fall @xcite , i.e. , gas at a density @xmath40 _ falls _ towards higher densities @xmath41 . without any change in physical processes for higher densities , free - fall would proceed unimpeded and the power - law would extend indefinitely . deviations from this idealised single power - law can be twofold . on the one hand",
    "the second excess could be due to a change in dynamics at high densities or due to observational effects . in the following we give some tentative explanations that , however , need more profound studies .    any physical process that slows down the free - fall motions reduces the flow of mass towards higher densities .",
    "we stress that in this paradigm the deceleration of free - fall stems from _ within _ the centres of the cloud clumps .",
    "processes acting from the outside like a hot ambient medium in which the cloud is embedded or large - scale colliding flows are unlikely to directly alter the pdf at the highest densities without altering the distribution at lower densities that is in the free - fall regime of the first power - law .",
    "rotational effects ( 1 . ) have been invoked to explain excess at high densities seen in a density pdf obtained from an isothermal , self - gravitating supersonic turbulence simulation @xcite .",
    "the spatial scales at which angular momentum is likely to dominate , however , are probably smaller than the resolution of the observations presented in this paper ( 0.10.25 pc ) . likewise ,",
    "thermodynamical effects of increasing thermal pressure due to shielding and reduced cooling ( 2 . )",
    "is unlikely to dominate at the observed scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the role of magnetic fields ( 3 . ) is rather unclear .",
    "it was shown that _ strong _",
    "@xcite or _ intermediate _",
    "@xcite magnetic fields , acting on a clump scale , slow down and can even completely prevent the star - formation process in magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations . if magnetic fields entirely prevent the collapse and star formation , the clouds are stable and will not show a first gravitationally dominated power - law in the pdf .",
    "_ moderate _ and _ weak _ magnetic fields tend to reduce the degree of fragmentation but once a gravitational instability sets in , the fields are unlikely to stop further collapse and star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , the n - pdf shows a power - law tail due to the gravitational collapse of the supercritical cores .",
    "moreover , a change in dominant geometry ( 4 . ) , i.e. , from filamentary to spherical , could also provide an explanation .",
    "longitudinal filament collapse on parsec scales reduces the mass transfer rate and dense gas is then piled up @xcite .",
    "all of the above proposed mechanisms to produce column density excess should apply for all types of clouds  not only to the most massive gmcs .",
    "therefore , high column density excesses should be observed more commonly , but this is not the case .",
    "note , however , that the slope of the power - law tail(s ) depends on the projection , i.e. the viewing angle , in which the cloud is being observed @xcite . in any case ,",
    "a major difference between clouds forming only low - mass stars and those with high - mass star - formation is stellar feedback ( 5 . ) .",
    "for example , additional compression by _ internal _ ionization due to an ultra - compact hii  region can provoke a power - law tail with @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "( high - mass ) outflows may also play a role .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the slope of the power - law pdf in different regions in perseus depends on the local feedback from low - mass young stellar objects .",
    "a recent study of monr2 @xcite revealed a significant number of co outflows in the central region that imprints on the velocity structure of the region .",
    "not all clouds with protostellar feedback , however , also show a second power - law .",
    "if feedback does not efficiently couple to the surroundings and the dense gas , an excess in the pdf might not develop or might not be visible at the observed scales in the column density pdf .",
    "at this point , it is not possible to give a final answer for our detection of excess / second power - law in the pdf of massive gmcs .",
    "further studies are required to look into more detail which of the proposed processes can play a dominant role . besides more sophisticated 3d hydrodynamic simualtions of star - forming regions a deeper understanding of how local thermal and dynamical properties are reflected in observations is needed .",
