    "neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) produces a plethora of absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift quasars .",
    "numerical n  body / hydrodynamics simulations of structure formation in the igm , within the framework of cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated cosmologies ( cen 1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; miralda  escud 1996 ; hernquist 1996 ; zhang 1998 ; theuns 1998a , b ; dav 1999 ; bryan 1999 ) , have recently provided a definite picture for the origin of the forest , one of an interconnected network of sheets and filaments with virialized systems ( halos ) located at their points of intersection . at @xmath7 , the lowest column density absorbers ( @xmath8 ) arise in this context in the underdense ( @xmath9 ) minivoids between the filaments , absorbers that give rise to moderate column density lines ( @xmath10 ) correspond to modestly overdense ( @xmath11 ) filaments , and high column density absorbers ( @xmath12 ) arise in highly overdense ( @xmath13 ) structures at the intersection of filaments ( zhang 1998 ) .",
    "most simulations to date assume that the igm is photoionized and photoheated by a uv background close to that inferred from quasars ( as computed by haardt & madau 1996 , hereafter hm96 ) .",
    "the overall normalization of the column density distribution depends approximately on the parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hydrogen ionization rate , @xmath16 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the baryon density parameter .",
    "the width of the lines , as measured by the @xmath19 parameter of a voigt profile , is set by thermal broadening , peculiar velocities , and hubble expansion across the filaments .",
    "while the first simulations showed good agreement with the observed line statistics , recent detailed studies at higher numerical resolution have revealed a serious conflict with the data : the models predict median values for the @xmath19 distribution of about @xmath20 at @xmath21 , compared with the observed median of @xmath22 ( theuns 1998b ; bryan 1999 ) .",
    "one possible way to restore the agreement with observations is to increase the temperature of the igm , adding to the thermal broadening .",
    "as theuns ( 1999 ) have pointed out , this may be achieved by increasing the baryon density @xmath23 , or by heating the gas for longer by increasing the age of the universe ( e.g. by lowering the total matter density @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , the gas temperature at late times is determined ( approximately ) by the balance between adiabatic cooling and photoelectric heating and varies as @xmath25 ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "thus the needed increase in temperature ( a factor of 2 ) is difficult to accomplish without conflicting with big bang nucleosynthesis for reasonable values of @xmath24 and @xmath16 ( theuns 1999 and   3 of this paper ) . delaying the reionization of helium",
    "may also help ( haehnelt & steinmetz 1998 ) , but this appears to boost the temperature by only a small factor .",
    "other mechanisms that could increase the line ",
    "width include photoelectric dust heating ( nath , sethi , & shchekinov 1999 ) and radiative transfer effects during the reionization of helium ( miralda  escud & rees 1994 ; abel & haehnelt 1999 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we point out that a potentially important heating term has been neglected in all previous numerical studies , namely compton heating of electrons by hard x  ray background photons .",
    "we show that this effect will dominate over photoelectric heating of hydrogen at redshifts @xmath26 in popular models for the redshift evolution of the extragalactic background radiation and that it will drive the igm towards a temperature of about @xmath27 k at @xmath6 .",
    "in an igm that interacts solely with a background of uv ionizing photons ( assumed to originate from quasars and/or star  forming galaxies ) , the dominant heat input is due to photoelectric heating of hydrogen and helium atoms .",
    "the energy input from hydrogen photoionization is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean neutral hydrogen density , @xmath30 the specific intensity of the uv radiation background , @xmath31 the photoionization cross  section , and @xmath32 the energy of the lyman edge .",
    "equation ( [ photo ] ) can be integrated to give @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ( proper ) energy density of the metagalactic flux . in a quasar ",
    "dominated background , photoheating by will be larger than @xmath35 by a factor 1.52 .",
    "the main cooling processes are compton cooling against the microwave background at high redshifts and adiabatic cooling at redshifts @xmath36 .",
    "allow now the intergalactic gas to exchange energy with the xrb through compton heating at a rate @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean electron density , @xmath39 the specific intensity of the xrb , and @xmath40 the thomson cross  section .",
    "energy is transferred from photons to electrons when @xmath41 , and in this limit equation ( [ compt ] ) becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mean photon energy and @xmath44 the energy density of the xrb . for photons above 100 kev relativistic effects",
    "become significant , and compton scattering takes place in the klein ",
    "nishina regime .",
    "the relativistic generalization of equation ( [ compt ] ) can be written as ( cf .",
    "blumenthal 1974 ) @xmath45 \\label{comptkn}\\ ] ] ( for @xmath46 ) , where @xmath47 is the photon energy in units of @xmath4 .",
    "all the energy of the primary electrons will be deposited into the medium as heat ( through coulomb collisions ) , since energy losses due to collisional excitation and ionization of h and he are negligible in such a highly ionized igm ( e.g. shull & van steenberg 1985 ) .    the xrb spectrum is characterized by a narrow peak in spectral power , @xmath48 , at 30 kev ; a simple analytical fit to the observed energy flux in units of @xmath49 yields @xmath50 from 3 to 60 kev ( boldt 1987 ) . at higher energies , the _ heao _ 1 a4 data can be fitted with a power ",
    "law , @xmath51 from 80 to 400 kev ( kinzer 1997 ) .",
    "the preliminary diffuse @xmath52ray spectrum from 800 kev to 30 mev measured with comptel ( kappadath 1996 ) obeys another power ",
    "law , @xmath53 ( kribs & rothstein 1997 ) .",
    "the total energy density in the 0.00330 mev band is @xmath54 .",
    "the mean , `` effective '' ( as it includes a large correction due to klein ",
    "nishina effects ) photon energy is @xmath55 kev . note that , because of the decline at high energies of the klein ",
    "nishina cross  section , the ( x@xmath56)ray heating rate is numerically equivalent to the rate one would derive by assuming pure thomson scattering of photons in the range 3180 kev only . with the adopted spectrum , about half of the total energy exchange rate at the present  epoch is provided by photons above 110 kev and about 14% is contributed by photons above 1 mev .",
    "we can now estimate the relative importance of compton versus photoelectric heating of hydrogen .",
    "the qso contribution to the local metagalactic flux at the lyman edge is @xmath57 @xmath58 ( hm96 ) . assuming a spectral index of @xmath59 , from equations ( [ photo ] ) and ( [ compt ] ) we get @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "the equation of ionization equilibrium for an igm with mean hydrogen density @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 and temperature @xmath65 k gives @xmath66 , hence @xmath67 . at the present ",
    "epoch , photoelectric heating is then the dominant contribution . at @xmath68 , the uv background from optically",
    " selected quasars increases to @xmath69 @xmath58 ( hm96 ) , the gas temperature reaches @xmath70k or higher , and ionization equilibrium now yields @xmath71 . if the bulk of the xrb is produced at high redshifts , @xmath44 increases as @xmath72 , and the rate of gain in thermal energy per baryon due to compton scattering goes up as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is less than unity because klein ",
    "nishina corrections become more important at high redshifts .",
    "the same exercise then yields @xmath75 at @xmath68 .",
    "the relative strength of the two competing heating terms will obviously depend on the redshift evolution of ionizing and x  ray extragalactic radiation .",
    "two cosmological effects may tend to make compton scattering of hard x  ray photons the dominant source of heating at high redshifts in a highly ionized , low density igm :    * at fixed ionization state and energy density ratio @xmath76 , the ratio @xmath77 increases with @xmath43 as @xmath78 , where @xmath74 for @xmath79 ; * at fixed ratio between the quasar uv and x  ray volume emissivities , the radiation energy density @xmath44 increases with redshift relative to @xmath34 , as the mean free path of photons at @xmath80   becomes very small , sources at higher redshifts are severely attenuated , and the uv background is largely `` local '' beyond a redshift of @xmath81 ( e.g. madau 1992 ) .    in the absence of any other cooling or heating mechanisms , compton cooling off cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons and compton heating by the xrb will drive the thermal state of the igm towards the compton temperature @xmath82 independently of the electron density . at @xmath61 , @xmath83 k.",
    "in this section we will calculate numerically the thermal history of a uniform igm of primordial composition within a cosmological context .",
    "the code that we use includes the relevant cooling and heating processes ( as described in theuns 1998b , and references therein ) and follows the non  equilibrium evolution of hydrogen and helium ionic species .",
    "the gas is allowed to interact with the cmb through compton cooling , with the xrb through compton heating , and with the time  dependent qso ionizing background as computed by hm96 .",
    "it is widely believed that the diffuse xrb is due to the summed emission from agns ( see fabian & barcons 1992 for a review ) .",
    "there is insufficient information , however , to uniquely infer from the data the evolution with cosmic time of the hard x  ray volume emissivity . according to the findings of boyle ( 1994 ) from _ rosat _ data",
    "( see also page 1996 ) , the model that best fits the cosmological evolution of soft x  ray selected agns in an einstein ",
    "desitter universe is one in which the comoving volume emissivity increases as @xmath84 for @xmath85 ( in qualitative agreement with the evolution of the qso optical luminosity function ) , and remains roughly constant at higher redshifts , up to @xmath86 ( miyaji , hasinger , & schmidt 1998 ) . assuming that these simple prescriptions also describe the evolution of hard x  ray sources , the energy density of the xrb then increases approximately as @xmath87 at low redshifts , and as @xmath88 at @xmath89 . to account for the existence of a high redshift cut ",
    "off , we will parameterize the evolution of the x  ray energy density as @xmath90 figure 1 shows the ensuing compton heating rate per baryon as a function of redshift for @xmath91 , compared with the photoionization heating rate from optically  selected quasars .",
    "figure 2 shows the thermal history of an igm with @xmath92 ( burles and tytler 1998 ) for two cosmological models : an einstein ",
    "desitter universe and a spatially flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant with parameters close to those inferred from type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( see efstathiou 1999 , and references therein ) . in both cases , we assume a photoionizing background as computed by hm96 and a hubble constant of @xmath93 ( see freedman 1998 ) .",
    "the dotted lines show the temperature evolution if the x  ray background is ignored , as has been assumed in all previous work .",
    "the solid lines include compton heating by the xrb according to the model of equation ( [ ux ] ) . including the x  ray background with a redshift cut ",
    "off parameter of @xmath91 causes the temperature of the igm to rise to @xmath94k at @xmath95 and @xmath96k at @xmath21 .",
    "the igm temperatures are even higher in the @xmath97dominated model .",
    "these results are extremely insensitive to the amplitude of the photoionizing background and relatively weakly dependent on @xmath98 and @xmath16 .",
    "they are , however , sensitive to the assumed redshift evolution of the x  ray background and to the hard x  ray spectrum at photon energies above @xmath99 kev , which is poorly known but dominate the heating rate .",
    "the results of figure 2 and the numerical simulations of theuns ( 1999 ) suggest that heating of the igm by the hard xrb may well be able to account for the @xmath19parameter distribution of the forest .",
    "furthermore , our results suggest that the observed @xmath19parameter distribution may provide a useful probe of the evolution of x  ray diffuse radiation at high redshift .",
    "compton heating will also tend to flatten the equation of state of the intergalactic gas , since the compton heating per unit mass is independent of density .",
    "however , for our model with @xmath91 , this effect is small , even for low density regions .",
    "we have shown that compton heating of electrons by hard x  ray background photons provides an important heating source of the igm . for plausible parameters ,",
    "heating by the xrb will be comparable to photoelectric heating at redshifts @xmath26 .",
    "this effect has been ignored in most numerical simulations of the forest , yet it can have a significant impact on the temperature of the igm , raising it to temperatures as high as @xmath100k at redshifts @xmath101 .",
    "the increase in igm temperature caused by this effect may explain why the @xmath19parameter distributions derived from numerical simulations ( theuns 1998b ; bryan 1999 ) are narrower than those observed .",
    "theuns ( 1999 ) have previously suggested that the temperature of the igm can be raised by invoking a high baryon density in a universe with low total matter density .",
    "however , the density required , @xmath102 , is well above the value implied by primordial nucleosynthesis and the measurements of the deuterium abundances from quasar spectra ( @xmath103 , burles and tytler 1998 ) .",
    "compton heating by hard x  ray photons may help to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "the origin and main production epoch of the xrb are still largely unsolved problems .",
    "the @xmath19parameter distribution of the lines could provide important information on the evolution of x  ray background radiation at high redshifts .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that , as another consequence of compton heating of the igm , there may exist an x  ray proximity effect , in analogy with the usual uv proximity effect ( e.g. bechtold 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "this could result in a hotter igm , and consequently broader lines , in the immediate vicinity of a long  lived x  ray emitting quasar ( lifetime @xmath104 the compton heating timescale ) .",
    "we have benefited from useful discussions with g. bryan , a. meiksin , j. miralda  escud , m. rees , and t. theuns .",
    "we are especially grateful to jordi miralda ",
    "escud for pointing out the importance of relativistic corrections at high redshift .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through atp grant nag54236 , and by nsf through grant phy9407194(pm ) .",
