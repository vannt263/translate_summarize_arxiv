    "mira  a ( o  ceti , hd  14386 ) is the prototype for a class of pulsating giant stars on the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the pulsations of mira variables help drive very strong winds from the surfaces of these stars .",
    "mass loss rate estimates for mira  a itself generally fall in the range @xmath4 to @xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "mira  a has a companion star , mira  b , which is located @xmath8 away @xcite , corresponding to a projected distance of about 70  au at its distance of @xmath9  pc @xcite .",
    "mira  a s wind is being accreted by mira  b , forming an accretion disk .",
    "the mira system is attractive for studying accretion processes since it is one of the few wind accretion systems in which the components of the system are resolvable .",
    "mira  b s accretion disk emits broad , high temperature emission lines of c  iv @xmath101550 , si  iii ] @xmath101892 , and mg  ii @xmath102800 , among others , which were first observed by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) @xcite .",
    "the optical and uv continuum of mira  b appears to be dominated by the accretion based on its strong variability on many timescales , and based on accretion rate estimates of @xmath11 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 @xcite . because of the complexities involved with the wind accretion onto mira  b , it is uncertain whether the star is a white dwarf or a red dwarf .",
    "the uv spectrum of mira  b was observed many times by iue between 1979 and 1995 @xcite , and also by the faint object camera ( foc ) instrument on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) on 1995 december 11 @xcite . the uv continuum and emission lines of mira",
    "b show some modest variability within the 19791995 data , with fluxes varying by about a factor of 2",
    ". however , on 1999 august 2 the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instrument on hst obtained a uv spectrum from mira  b that was radically different from any previous observation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the fluxes of the continuum and high temperature emission lines ( e.g. , c  iv @xmath101550 , si  iii ] @xmath101892 , mg  ii @xmath102800 , etc . ) were over an order of magnitude lower than ever observed before .",
    "furthermore , the character of the spectrum below 1700    had changed dramatically , with the spectrum dominated by many narrow h@xmath0 lines rather than being dominated by the aforementioned broad , high temperature lines .",
    "these h@xmath0 lines are pumped by the strong h  i ly@xmath1 line , a fluorescence mechanism that has been found to produce detectable h@xmath0 emission from the sun and more recently from many other astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "the surprising stis data raise many new questions about the accretion onto mira  b. why did the uv fluxes fall so dramatically ? where are all these h@xmath0 lines coming from ? why were the h@xmath0 lines not observed by iue ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) analyzed the h@xmath0 lines in detail .",
    "they found that the dominance of h@xmath0 emission in the 1999 hst / stis data is due at least in part to an h  i ly@xmath1 line that is _ not _ weaker than during the iue era , unlike the continuum and every other non - h@xmath0 line in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , the h@xmath0 lines pumped by ly@xmath1 appear much stronger relative to other uv emission lines than before , when the h@xmath0 lines were not even detectable by iue .",
    "it was proposed in papers i and ii that the fundamental cause of the change in mira  b s uv spectrum was an order of magnitude decrease in the accretion rate onto the star .",
    "this interpretation is supported by analysis of wind absorption in the mg  ii h & k lines at 2803 and 2796   , respectively , which shows that the accretion - driven mass loss rate from mira  b at the time of the hst / stis observations is lower by about an order of magnitude from what it was during the iue era , consistent with the observed decrease in accretion luminosity .",
    "exactly why the ly@xmath1 flux did _ not _ decrease with everything else in the spectrum remains somewhat of a mystery . in paper",
    "ii , we suggested that the ly@xmath1 emission may have indeed decreased , but the weaker wind opacity at the time of the hst / stis observations allowed more ly@xmath1 emission to escape and compensated for this decrease .",
    "as far as where the h@xmath0 lines are coming from , several arguments were presented in paper ii against the h@xmath0 emission being from the accretion disk .",
    "instead , the h@xmath0 lines are most likely coming from h@xmath0 within mira  a s wind , which is being heated and dissociated by h  i ly@xmath1 as it approaches mira  b. the h@xmath0 emission line ratios and the amount of h@xmath0 absorption observed for the pumping transitions within ly@xmath1 are both consistent with an h@xmath0 layer with @xmath12  k and @xmath13 .",
    "this temperature is close to the dissociation temperature of h@xmath0 , suggesting that the h@xmath0 could be from an h@xmath0 photodissociation front surrounding mira  b. a photodissociation front model presented in paper ii demonstrates that such a front can indeed reproduce the properties of the h@xmath0 emission , although it was suggested that the collision of the winds of mira  a and b could also play a role in heating the h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0 photodissociation rate estimated from the data is roughly consistent with mira  b s @xmath14",
    "m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 total accretion rate , meaning that the h@xmath0 we are seeing being fluoresced and dissociated by ly@xmath1 is probably on its way to being ultimately accreted onto mira  b. molecular hydrogen is the dominant constituent of mira  a s wind by mass , so the accretion processes relating to h@xmath0 are particularly important .",
    "the fluorescence , dissociation , and heating of the h@xmath0 by ly@xmath1 , which is what the uv h@xmath0 lines are probing , is therefore an important step in the process of accretion onto mira  b.    in this paper , we report on new uv observations of mira  b from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "the fuse satellite observes the @xmath15    wavelength range , which is almost entirely inaccessible to the hst .",
    "the mira binary system has never been observed in this wavelength region , so the fuse data allow us to search for new emission line diagnostics for mira  b.",
    "the fuse satellite observed mira  b on 2001 november 27 starting at ut 9:04:57 .",
    "the observation consisted of 11 separate exposures through the low resolution ( lwrs ) aperture , with a combined exposure time of 29,183 s. the spectra were processed using version 2.0.5 of the calfuse pipeline software .",
    "note that while mira  a and mira  b are both within the @xmath16 lwrs aperture , experience with iue data demonstrates that miras do not produce any detectable emission below 2000    @xcite , so any emission detected by fuse should be from mira  b.    in order to fully cover its 9051187    spectral range , fuse has a multi - channel design  two channels ( lif1 and lif2 ) use al+lif coatings , two channels ( sic1 and sic2 ) use sic coatings , and there are two different detectors ( a and b ) . for a full description of the instrument , see @xcite . with",
    "this design fuse acquires spectra in 8 segments covering different , overlapping wavelength ranges .",
    "we coadded the individual exposures to produce spectra for each segment .",
    "we experimented with cross - correlating the exposures before coaddition , but there are not many spectral features strong enough to cross - correlate against , so the simple straight coaddition proved more reliable .",
    "coaddition of the various segments with each other can potentially lead to degradation of spectral resolution , but we decided to do this anyway to increase the low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of our data .",
    "we inspected the individual segments carefully to ensure they were reasonably well aligned before coadding them .",
    "figure  1 shows two regions of the fuse spectrum .",
    "the top panel is a coaddition of the sic1b and sic2a segments and the bottom panel is a combination of the lif1b and lif2a segments .",
    "we have rebinned the two spectra by factors of 15 and 5 , respectively , to increase s / n .",
    "the fuse data highly oversample the line spread function , so this rebinning does not severely degrade the spectral resolution even for the factor - of-15 rebinning .",
    "the bottom spectrum in figure  1 has also been smoothed slightly , but only for purposes of display .",
    "no stellar emission is detected between 990 and 1115   , so that region of the fuse spectrum is not shown .",
    "the top panel of figure  1 shows mostly only airglow lines of h  i and o  i. there is a broad emission feature at 976    that may be c  iii 977.02    emission from the star , but the feature is shifted from its expected location by a suspiciously large amount ( @xmath17 200 km  s@xmath7 ) , making this identification tentative ( see  5 ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows numerous narrow lines that we identify as h@xmath0 emission , as will be described in detail below .",
    "many of these lines are blended with the c  iii @xmath101175 multiplet , making it unclear whether c  iii is really contributing any flux to the blend at all .",
    "both c  iii lines shown in figure  1 are strong lines frequently seen in stellar spectra , and we expected to be able to detect these lines from the mira  b accretion disk .",
    "we will discuss them further in  5 .",
    "we have fitted gaussians to all of the stellar emission features shown in figure  1 , using a chi - squared minimization routine to determine the best fit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first three columns of table  1 list the fit parameters and their 1@xmath18 uncertainties .",
    "the parameters are the central wavelength ( @xmath19 ) , flux ( @xmath20 , in units of @xmath21 ergs  @xmath22  s@xmath7 ) , and full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated using a monte carlo technique whereby the fluxes in the spectrum are varied within the bounds suggested by the flux error vector , and a large number of fits are performed on the altered spectra to see how much fit parameters vary .",
    "our quoted 1@xmath18 uncertainties are the 1@xmath18 variations of the monte carlo trials .",
    "figure  2 shows the fit to the complicated blend at 1176   .",
    "the narrow lines are all h@xmath0 lines , and we assume the sum of the two broad components is representative of the c  iii emission . the parameters for both broad gaussians are listed in table  1 and tentatively identified as c  iii .    the line spread function of fuse is not particularly well defined , so we have made no attempt to correct for instrumental broadening in our fits .",
    "the h@xmath0 lines observed by hst / stis have an average width of @xmath23 km  s@xmath7 , after correction for instrumental broadening ( paper  ii ) .",
    "the effective resolution of fuse is @xmath24 km  s@xmath7 , so we expect the fuse h@xmath0 lines to have widths of @xmath25 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with the measured line widths in table  1 , with blending perhaps being responsible for the broadening of a few h@xmath0 lines .",
    "the h@xmath0 lines have average redshifts of @xmath26 km  s@xmath7 relative to their rest wavelengths . considering the @xmath27 km  s@xmath7 uncertainty in the fuse wavelength calibration ,",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath28 km  s@xmath7 velocity found for the stis h@xmath0 lines , which in turn is consistent with the mira system s radial velocity of @xmath29 km  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "most of the h@xmath0 lines listed in table  1 have never before been identified in any astrophysical spectrum . in paper",
    "ii , we found that all of the h@xmath0 lines observed by hst / stis could be associated with lyman band fluorescence sequences pumped by the strong h  i ly@xmath1 line .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission excites h@xmath0 from various rovibrational states within the ground electronic state ( @xmath30 ) to the excited @xmath31 state .",
    "radiative deexcitation back to various levels of the ground electronic state yields the lyman band fluorescence sequences observed by stis .",
    "we conclusively identified h@xmath0 lines in the stis spectrum by finding many lines in each fluorescence sequence , each having a ly@xmath1 pumping path , and noting that the line ratios are at least roughly consistent with the transition branching ratios .",
    "this is harder to do in our fuse spectrum , because we have fewer lines to work with .",
    "the lyman band sequences from paper  ii only contribute to a couple of the h@xmath0 lines in figure  1 ( at 1143    and 1162   ) .",
    "the other narrow lines are from previously unidentified sequences .",
    "we used the lyman band line list of @xcite to search for possible matches to our narrow fuse lines , but we quickly found that most of these lines are clearly not lyman band h@xmath0 .",
    "however , we were much more successful when we searched the werner band h@xmath0 line list of @xcite . just as emission from ly@xmath1 can excite h@xmath0 to the @xmath31 state to produce lyman band emission , ly@xmath1 can also excite h@xmath0 to the excited @xmath32 state to produce werner band emission , most of which falls within the fuse bandpass rather than the higher wavelength range of stis .",
    "the werner band fluorescence is of a slightly different character than the lyman band fluorescence .",
    "quantum selection rules require lyman band transitions to have @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the upper and lower rotational quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "transitions with @xmath36 are defined as p - branch lines and those with @xmath37 are r - branch lines .",
    "the @xmath32 state is actually degenerate and consists of a @xmath38 state and a @xmath39 state .",
    "the energy levels of the two states are practically identical , but werner band transitions from @xmath38 must have @xmath40 ( i.e. , p and r branch transitions ) , while transitions from @xmath39 must have @xmath41 ( q branch transitions ) .",
    "the werner band is therefore different from the lyman band in having a q branch , but because the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states are different the q branch lines can only be pumped by q branch transitions within ly@xmath1 , and the p and r branch lines can only be pumped by p and r branch transitions .",
    "perusal of the @xcite line lists leads to possible h@xmath0 identifications for all the narrow lines seen in the fuse data , but conclusive identification is complicated due to most potential new fluorescence sequences having only 1 or 2 observed lines , and also due to many of the lines possibly being blends of more than one h@xmath0 line . in order to clarify the situation and provide support for the detection of some of the weaker h@xmath0 lines ,",
    "we perform a forward modeling exercise using the results of paper  ii . in paper",
    "ii , we used the stis h@xmath0 lines to estimate the temperature and column density of the h@xmath0 , and we also reconstructed the ly@xmath1 profile that the h@xmath0 must see in order to account for the observed h@xmath0 flux . using these results , we create a synthetic h@xmath0 spectrum , considering all new lyman and werner band fluorescence sequences that may be contributing to the fuse h@xmath0 lines . in table  1",
    ", we list the line fluxes predicted by this forward modeling exercise ( @xmath42 ) . in particular , table  1 lists all lines that we believe contribute at least 10% of the flux of an observed fuse h@xmath0 feature based on the @xmath42 values . note that there is a broad , weak emission feature at 11341138    that our forward modeling exercise suggests may be partially h@xmath0 emission .",
    "however , h@xmath0 lines can not seem to account for most of the flux of the line , so we do not consider it a clearly detected h@xmath0 feature .",
    "another purpose of the forward modeling exercise , besides line identification , is to see if the reconstructed ly@xmath1 profile and h@xmath0 parameters from paper  ii can reproduce the fluxes in our fuse data .",
    "table  1 shows that the predicted fluxes generally agree with the measured fluxes rather well , with a few exceptions .",
    "the ly@xmath1 profile must therefore be about the same at the time of the fuse observation ( 2001 november 27 ) as it was at the time of the stis observation ( 1999 august 2 ) .",
    "this means that we can consider the fuse and stis h@xmath0 lines together to refine the h@xmath0 analysis presented in paper  ii , which we will do in  4 .",
    "while trying to identify the fuse h@xmath0 lines , we also revisited the stis data and found one new stis h@xmath0 fluorescence sequence , which is also listed in table  1 .",
    "the five detected lines in this sequence are individually rather weak , but collectively they amount to a convincing detection .",
    "this new sequence is important because it is fluoresced at a lower wavelength than any other mira  b h@xmath0 sequence , thereby providing a useful diagnostic for the h@xmath0-observed ly@xmath1 flux at shorter wavelengths ( see  4 ) .",
    "we note that this sequence was also detected in observations of the t  tauri star tw  hya @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that only a few of the h@xmath0 lines listed in table  1 have been identified in previous astrophysical spectra . while fluoresced lyman band h@xmath0 lines have been observed and analyzed from a number of different sources ( see  1 ) , the list of werner band detections is very short .",
    "@xcite noted a couple werner lines in solar spectra , which are actually fluoresced by the o  vi @xmath101032 line rather than ly@xmath1 , and @xcite report fuse detections of a few werner band h@xmath0 lines from the prototype young accreting star system , t  tauri .",
    "planetary aurora produce abundant h@xmath0 emission in both the lyman and werner bands , but this is collisionally excited rather than fluoresced emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "table  2 lists all the pumping transitions within ly@xmath1 that are responsible for the h@xmath0 lines observed by fuse and stis .",
    "our analysis has expanded the list from the 13 lyman band sequences analyzed in paper  ii to 16 lyman and 13 werner sequences .",
    "this increase in h@xmath0 data is sufficient to justify a reanalysis of the h@xmath0 lines to see if conclusions from paper  ii remain unchanged .",
    "the ratios of h@xmath0 fluxes within each fluorescence sequence are inconsistent with the line branching ratios and are therefore clearly affected by opacity effects ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "the opacity of the h@xmath0 lines depends on the level populations of the h@xmath0 molecules being fluoresced , which in turn depends on the temperature , t , and total column density of the h@xmath0 , @xmath43 .",
    "the line ratios are therefore a diagnostic for t and @xmath43 . in paper",
    "ii , we developed a plane parallel , monte carlo radiative transfer code to determine which t and @xmath43 values best fit the line ratios .",
    "we repeat this analysis including the new h@xmath0 data presented here . for the blended lines in table  1 , we divide up the line flux according to the percent contributions to the line suggested by the @xmath42 values .    for each transition , we need to know the absorption strength ( @xmath44 ) , and the energy ( @xmath45 ) and statistical weight ( @xmath46 ) of the lower level .",
    "the necessary atomic data are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "table  2 lists the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 values of the ly@xmath1 pumping transitions .",
    "another factor considered in the radiative transfer model is dissociation .",
    "fluorescence to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states can result in dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule rather than radiative deexcitation back to the ground electronic state .",
    "the dissociation probabilities listed in @xcite are considered in the model .",
    "the @xmath47 values in table  2 indicate the fractional probability of dissociation for each excitation to the excited electronic state .",
    "the @xmath48 values indicate the fraction of fluorescences within each sequence that ultimately lead to dissociation rather than the emergence of an h@xmath0 line photon , based on our best - fit radiative transfer model ( see below ) .",
    "line opacity can cause multiple photoexcitations before an h@xmath0 photon emerges or an h@xmath0 molecule is destroyed , so @xmath49 . in paper  ii , the @xcite tables were read incorrectly , resulting in the dissociation fractions being significantly overestimated .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 values in table  2 of paper  ii are therefore too large in general .",
    "besides consideration of the new fuse data , a secondary reason for reanalyzing the h@xmath0 lines is to revise our analysis to see if conclusions made in paper  ii regarding the importance of dissociation still stand .",
    "the only free parameters of the model and @xmath50 and @xmath43 , and figure  3 shows @xmath51 contours measuring how well the h@xmath0 line ratios are reproduced by models with different t and @xmath52 values .",
    "the h@xmath0 line ratios are best explained by an h@xmath0 layer with a temperature and column density of @xmath2  k and @xmath3 , respectively , similar to the @xmath53  k and @xmath54 results from paper  ii .",
    "thus , neither the new fuse data nor the corrected treatment of dissociation change these values much .",
    "the third column of table  2 lists the total ly@xmath1 flux absorbed that emerges as h@xmath0 line flux , @xmath55 , not including the absorbed flux that leads to h@xmath0 dissociation .",
    "these @xmath55 values include corrections for h@xmath0 lines in each sequence that are too weak to be detected , with the correction factors provided by the best - fit radiative transfer model .",
    "the @xmath55 values in table  2 are slightly higher than those from paper  ii ( for the 13 original lyman band sequences ) due to the lower dissociation fractions .",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath48 values in table  2 can be used to compute the ly@xmath1 flux that must be overlying each h@xmath0 pumping transition within ly@xmath1 , thereby allowing us to reconstruct the ly@xmath1 profile seen by the h@xmath0 , @xmath56 .",
    "once again we refer the reader to paper  ii for details of this computation , although here we assume our revised values of @xmath2  k and @xmath3 in the calculations .",
    "figure  4 shows the new reconstructed ly@xmath1 profile .",
    "the analysis assumes that the fluoresced h@xmath0 completely surrounds the star and that the h@xmath0 emission emerges isotropically .",
    "if these assumptions are inaccurate , the derived profile will be different from the actual profile by some geometric scaling factor , @xmath57 , explaining why the y - axis of figure  4 is labeled @xmath58 .",
    "the red and green boxes in figure  4 show the inferred flux overlying lyman and werner band transitions , respectively , which pump observed fluorescence sequences .",
    "these data points collectively map out a self - consistent ly@xmath1 line profile , albeit with some scatter .",
    "the consistency of the werner band data points , which are entirely from the fuse data , and the lyman band data points , which are mostly from the stis data , provides further evidence that the ly@xmath1 profile is the same at the time of the fuse and stis observations .",
    "our best estimate for the reconstructed ly@xmath1 profile is indicated by the dashed line in figure  4 .",
    "this is not very different from the profile derived in paper  ii ( also shown in fig .  4 ) .",
    "the biggest difference between the two profiles is below 1215.5   , which is entirely due to the addition of the new 31 r(15 ) lyman band sequence fluoresced at 1214.4648   .",
    "this is the only sequence fluoresced at wavelengths blueward of the stellar rest frame .",
    "its existence demonstrates that the h@xmath0 sees at least some ly@xmath1 flux on the blue side of the line . as described in paper  ii , the reason the observed and reconstructed ly@xmath1 lines are highly redshifted is because of absorption from mira  b s wind on the blue side of the line .",
    "the upper limits in figure  4 are from lyman and werner band transitions within ly@xmath1 that do not fluoresce enough h@xmath0 emission to be detectable .",
    "these upper limits are consistent with the ly@xmath1 profile derived from the detected fluorescence sequences .    photodissociation rates were overestimated in paper  ii due to the use of inaccurate dissociation fractions ( see above ) .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to derive better estimates for h@xmath0 photodissociation rates using the revised analysis presented here .",
    "we computed these rates for the detected sequences listed in table  2 , using the @xmath55 and @xmath48 values in that table , and we found that some of the weaker sequences that are newly detected in our fuse data [ e.g. , 50 p(20 ) ] are surprisingly strong contributors to the total h@xmath0 dissociation rate .",
    "this suggests that undetected sequences might collectively contribute substantially to h@xmath0 dissociation via ly@xmath1 fluorescence .",
    "therefore , the best way to accurately estimate the h@xmath0 photodissociation rate is to perform a forward modeling exercise computing contributions for _ all _ h@xmath0 transitions within ly@xmath1 , not just the ones that yield detected h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the numerous upper limits in figure  4 provide some idea for how many h@xmath0 transitions must be considered .",
    "we perform this calculation using the monte carlo radiative transfer routine described above and in paper  ii , assuming the ly@xmath1 profile derived in figure  4 , and assuming the @xmath2  k and @xmath3 values from the line ratio analysis to compute the h@xmath0 level populations .",
    "figure  5 shows a simulated uv h@xmath0 spectrum computed from this calculation .",
    "we estimate that the total ly@xmath1 flux absorbed and reemitted by h@xmath0 is @xmath59 ergs  @xmath22  s@xmath7 , about 31% higher than the flux one would estimate from the detected sequences alone .",
    "about 6.8% of the fluorescences lead to h@xmath0 dissociation rather than the emergence of an h@xmath0 line photon , suggesting a dissociation rate of @xmath60 s@xmath7 ( at mira s distance of 128  pc ) , or @xmath61",
    "m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 .",
    "surprisingly , this is a factor of 2.1 times higher than the value one would derive from the detected sequences alone .",
    "although the undetected sequences absorb less ly@xmath1 flux , they tend to have higher dissociation fractions and therefore contribute significantly to the dissociation rate .",
    "nevertheless , the largest contributor to h@xmath0 dissociation is the detected 40 p(19 ) lyman band sequence , which accounts for 23.5% of the total dissociation rate .",
    "although the dissociation fractions assumed in paper  ii were too high , this is mitigated by the legitimate increase in dissociation rate provided by consideration of undetected fluorescence sequences .",
    "thus , the dissociation rate quoted above is only a factor of 2 lower than reported in paper  ii . in paper",
    "ii , we proposed that the h@xmath0 emission is arising within a photodissociation front within mira  a s wind as it approaches mira  b , and we constructed a model of this front consistent with the observations .",
    "we experiment with new photodissociation front models assuming our revised estimates for photodissociation rates , and we find that the factor of 2 change is not enough to significantly alter the model .",
    "thus , the photodissociation front model remains a very viable interpretation for the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , the implied h@xmath0 dissociation rate is comparable to mira  b s total accretion rate , consistent with the idea that the uv h@xmath0 emission is showing us h@xmath0 in mira  a s wind being fluoresced , heated , and dissociated by ly@xmath1 as it approaches and is ultimately accreted by mira  b.    we now discuss some of the limitations of our h@xmath0 modeling efforts , because our estimation of @xmath50 and @xmath43 and our reconstruction of the ly@xmath1 profile in figure  4 rely on several assumptions . for example",
    ", our plane - parallel modeling essentially assumes that mira  b is surrounded by an isothermal h@xmath0 layer of uniform @xmath43 and that h@xmath0 level populations are precisely thermal . in reality",
    ", the h@xmath0 may have a distribution of temperatures ( as the photodissociation front models actually predict ) , it may be distributed inhomogenously around the star , and the fluorescence process itself could lead to some level of nonthermality in the level populations .",
    "the limitations introduced by our simplifying assumptions are presumably responsible for the significant scatter of ly@xmath1 flux data points in figure  4 about the best - fit dashed line ly@xmath1 profile , beyond the measurement uncertainties . since the reconstructed profile imprecisely reproduces the data points in figure  4 , the h@xmath0 fluxes of the synthetic spectrum described above are naturally imprecise as well . for example",
    ", the synthetic spectrum predicts lines at 1130    and 1135    that are significantly stronger than observed and a line at 1162  significantly weaker than observed ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "another source of uncertainty is line blending , which is not considered in our radiative transfer calculations .",
    "for example , there are 2 lyman band data points at 1219    in figure  4 that are too low , probably because these h@xmath0 pumping transitions are blended enough that they are partially shielding each other from the full ly@xmath1 flux present at that wavelength .",
    "emission line blends could also lead to h@xmath0 photons shifting from one fluorescence sequence to another .",
    "all the effects and assumptions described above could lead to inaccuracies in our derived h@xmath0 properties .",
    "one goal of our fuse observations was to try to detect broad , high temperature emission lines formed in the accretion disk of mira  b. we see no evidence of the o  vi @xmath621032,1038 lines , which are typically very strong lines in coronal spectra . we estimate a 3@xmath18 upper limit of @xmath63 ergs  @xmath22  s@xmath7 for these lines .",
    "the only possible accretion lines are the two c  iii lines shown in figure  1 .",
    "the widths of these two lines are roughly consistent with observations of high temperature lines from iue @xcite , but the identification with c  iii is still somewhat tentative .",
    "we identify the broad bump at 976.447    as c  iii @xmath10977 , but if it is c  iii it has a very large blueshift of @xmath64 km  s@xmath7 , assuming a stellar velocity of @xmath65 km  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the scattered solar c  iii @xmath10977 line is sometimes seen in fuse spectra , but the observed feature is far too broad for that to be responsible .",
    "the spike seen on the red edge of the line could perhaps be the solar emission .",
    "one possible explanation for the blueshift of the c  iii line is that we are seeing emission predominantly from the side of the accretion disk that is rotating towards us .",
    "there is no corresponding blueshift of the c  iii @xmath101175 line ( see below ) , but the @xmath10977 line is a high opacity resonance line , meaning intervening c  iii material could in principle scatter background @xmath10977 emission , while the @xmath101175 lines are lower opacity intersystem lines , so the same process may not work for @xmath101175 .",
    "another possible explanation for the c  iii blueshift is absorption from overlying h@xmath0 .",
    "the density of h@xmath0 transitions increases towards the shorter wavelengths accessible to fuse .",
    "these transitions will have higher opacities than any of the observed h@xmath0 lines , since they will be originating from lower , more populated levels of the ground electronic state .",
    "below about 1110    there are lyman and werner band transitions from the lowest levels that will be populated even at very cool temperatures .",
    "the column densities of h@xmath0 in these lowest levels could be much higher than for the @xmath2  k population that we have detected via ly@xmath1 fluorescence .",
    "this is because most of the h@xmath0 within mira  a s wind , in which mira  b is embedded , will be at low @xmath66  k temperatures , and only the lowest energy levels will be populated in this cold h@xmath0 . because of the significant h@xmath0 opacity in the neighborhood of the c  iii @xmath10977 line , the red side of the line might be absorbed , making the resulting c  iii profile appear as blueshifted as seen in our fuse data . despite these plausible explanations for the blueshift , the detection of the @xmath10977 line will remain tentative until a more definitive explanation of the blueshift is available .",
    "the c  iii @xmath101175 multiplet is blended with many h@xmath0 emission lines and it is therefore unclear that c  iii is actually contributing to the observed emission .",
    "at the end of  4 we described a forward modeling calculation designed to compute the total h@xmath0 photodissociation rate from ly@xmath1 fluorescence , including contributions from undetected fluorescence sequences .",
    "this calculation also provides us with the synthetic h@xmath0 emission spectrum shown in figure  5 .",
    "this figure compares the synthetic spectrum with the fuse data , demonstrating a reasonably good fit to the observed h@xmath0 lines .",
    "the bottom panel focuses on the 1176    region .",
    "we subtract the h@xmath0 spectrum from the data to see if the h@xmath0 lines can account for all of the line flux .",
    "the residual flux shown below the lowest panel of figure  5 suggests that there is flux remaining after this subtraction that we can associate with the c  iii @xmath101175 multiplet .",
    "the integrated flux remaining is @xmath67 ergs  @xmath22  s@xmath7 , in good agreement with the c  iii flux suggested by the two - gaussian representation in figure  2 , providing support for this being a reasonably accurate c  iii flux measurement .",
    "the flux ratio of c  iii @xmath10977 and c  iii @xmath101175 is often used as a density diagnostic , but in mira  b s case the significant uncertainties involved in measuring both lines are too large to obtain a believable density measurement .",
    "the 1176    emission feature is the only feature in our fuse spectrum that is also detectable in the previous hst / stis spectrum ( see fig .  2 in paper i ) .",
    "the sensitivity of stis drops dramatically below 1200   , so the s / n of the stis spectrum at 1176    is very low .",
    "the data quality does not allow us to separate the h@xmath0 emission from the c  iii emission , so we can only report a total stis flux of @xmath68 ergs  @xmath22  s@xmath7 for the 1176    line .",
    "this agrees well with the integrated fuse flux of @xmath69 ergs  @xmath22  s@xmath7 . in  3 and",
    " 4 , we demonstrated that the h  i ly@xmath1 line had not changed between the times of the stis and fuse observations .",
    "the excellent flux agreement for the 1176    feature provides further evidence that the uv spectrum of mira  b is unchanged .",
    "the c  iii @xmath101175 line has also been observed numerous times by iue .",
    "we found 32 short - wavelength , low - resolution ( sw - lo ) observations of mira  b in the iue archive .",
    "only about half of them are long enough exposures with sufficient s / n to measure a c  iii flux .",
    "note that while h@xmath0 may be contaminating the c  iii line in the hst / stis and fuse data , we do not believe that this is the case for the iue data . in paper",
    "i it was argued that unblended h@xmath0 features should have been seen in the iue data if h@xmath0 were contributing flux to other emission features such as c  iii @xmath101175 .    in figure  6",
    ", we plot the c  iii fluxes as a function of time , where for purposes of this figure we have made no attempt to correct the stis and fuse fluxes for h@xmath0 contamination .",
    "the stis and fuse fluxes are about an order of magnitude lower than the iue fluxes , consistent with the drop in flux seen in the continuum and many other emission lines ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the drop in flux is presumably due to a substantial decrease in accretion rate , which also led to a similar decrease in mass loss rate for mira  b ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "the consistency of the 1999 stis and 2001 fuse data demonstrates that this decrease is an enduring phenomenon .",
    "it is possible that similar changes in accretion rate have been detected from optical data .",
    "mira  b is difficult to observe from the ground due to its close proximity with the generally brighter mira  a , but during mira  a minimum it is possible to detect the presence of mira  b. @xcite and @xcite report a possible periodic variation in mira  b s optical light curve with a period of 14 years and with an intensity range of about a factor of 4 . considering that these optical intensities will be contaminated with mira  a emission even at mira  a minimum",
    ", these variations might be consistent with the factor of 20 variations seen in the uv .",
    "however , if the period of these variations is 14 years , why did the long - lived iue not see them ?",
    "@xcite report a mira  b optical minimum in 1971 , so in figure  6 we display a 14-year period sine curve consistent with this phasing .",
    "all the iue data points occur near predicted maxima , while the stis and fuse data points are near a predicted minimum .",
    "there is an unfortunate time gap in the iue data from 19811990 that means the predicted mira  b minimum period was not covered by the iue sw - lo data set .",
    "thus , it is possible that the substantial drop in flux seen by stis and fuse is simply the uv manifestation of the 14-year optical cycle detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one argument against this is that while there are no sw - lo iue observations from 19811990 , there are long - wavelength , low - resolution ( lw - lo ) spectra from 1983 july 9 and 1988 january 8 .",
    "although mg  ii @xmath102800 and continuum fluxes are somewhat lower than average in these spectra , neither spectrum shows flux levels dramatically below those of other lw - lo observations in the iue data set .",
    "this leaves only about a 5-year time gap in the iue coverage during which mira  b fluxes could have dropped tremendously like they did in 19992001 .",
    "nevertheless , it would be worthwhile to observe mira  b again with fuse and/or hst in 20042007 to see if high uv fluxes return as figure  6 predicts .",
    "we have analyzed uv observations of the wind - accreting star mira  b , using new fuse spectra combined with previous hst / stis data .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    ": :    in the new fuse data , we detect ly@xmath1-fluoresced    h@xmath0 lines that are mostly werner band lines rather    than the lyman band lines previously detected by hst .",
    "most of the fuse    h@xmath0 lines have never before been identified in an    astrophysical spectrum .",
    "2 . : :    using previously developed techniques , we analyze the mira  b    h@xmath0 emission , combining the old hst / stis and the new    fuse h@xmath0 data .",
    "we estimate a temperature and column    density for the h@xmath0 layer responsible for the emission    of @xmath2  k and @xmath3 ,    respectively .",
    "3 . : :    our modeling efforts demonstrate that undetected h@xmath0    fluorescence sequences actually produce more h@xmath0    photodissociation from ly@xmath1 fluorescence than do the    detected sequences . considering both , we estimate a total    photodissociation rate of @xmath61    m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 , comparable to the    @xmath11 m@xmath6    yr@xmath7 total accretion rate of mira  b. the fuse and hst    h@xmath0 emission may be coming from a photodissociation    front , as first proposed in the analysis of the hst data ( see    paper  ii ) .",
    "4 . : :    the only stellar lines detected in our fuse spectrum other than    h@xmath0 are the broad c  iii @xmath10977 and    c  iii @xmath101175 lines , which originate from within    mira  b s accretion disk .",
    "the c  iii @xmath10977 line is    highly blueshifted from its expected location , which leads us to    consider its identification as tentative .",
    "overlying    h@xmath0 absorption or particularly bright emission from    one side of the accretion disk could in principle be responsible for    the blueshift .",
    "the c  iii @xmath101175 line is heavily    blended with numerous h@xmath0 emission lines , making an    accurate flux measurement difficult .",
    "5 . : :    analysis of the h@xmath0 and c  iii    @xmath101175 lines in the 1999 hst / stis and 2001 fuse    data demonstrates that the uv spectrum of mira  b is roughly the same    at these two times .",
    "the uv fluxes of both data sets are dramatically    lower than ever observed by iue in 19791995 .",
    "the presence of the    lower fluxes over at least two years ( 19992001 ) demonstrates that    they are a persistent phenomenon .",
    ": :    we hypothesize that the drop in uv flux in 19992001 is associated    with a previously identified 14-year periodic variation in optical    emission from mira  b , and that iue missed the variation due to most    iue observations falling near the two maxima of the cycle during the    iue era .",
