    "experiments on atom or electronic systems of various types in photonic cavities have been opening up a new and exciting venue to test and manipulate photon - matter interactions in the strong coupling limit.@xcite    modeling of these time - dependent systems has commonly been aimed at evaluating their steady state properties , that can include such diverse observables as their conductance,@xcite the life time,@xcite the broadening,@xcite or the energy shift of certain many - body states or modes of relevance . here , we would like to draw attention to how the experimentally challenging transient time regime can reveal information about the interaction of the participating constituents , in our case , electrons and cavity photons .",
    "many different formalisms have been used to describe transport in many - body systems on the nanometer scale .",
    "most common have been methods built on various green function approaches.@xcite less common has been the use of master equations,@xcite or a generalized master equation in combination with configuration interaction ( ci),@xcite where the hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized in a truncated fock many - body space.@xcite between these two approaches is an interesting correspondence .",
    "when dealing with a system with two types of interactions , like the electron - electron interaction , and the electron - photon interaction , one typically may start by building a green function for the electron including the mutual electron interaction",
    ". a second step would be to evaluate the green function of the full system dressed by the photons.@xcite similarly , in a ci - approach , one starts by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix for the coulomb interacting electrons , constructs a new many - body fock - basis from the states of the coulomb interacting electrons and possibly the photon number operator , and diagonalizes then the full hamiltonian matrix.@xcite this approach has been termed : `` stepwise introduction of model complexity '' . theoretically , similar structure and accuracy could be accomplished for the static properties in the two very different formalism , though their actual potential depends strongly on the system of interest .",
    "their difference becomes more obvious for the dynamic or the transport part .    here",
    ", our goal is to apply the latter strategy to analyze the effective interaction of electrons in a very special system .",
    "we focus our attention on the interaction of two electrons in a parallel double dot system .",
    "we want to answer the question if it is possible to determine how the interaction of the two electrons with a single photon mode in the system modifies their repulsion .",
    "how is this effective electron - electron interaction ?",
    "does it depend on how the question is approached , using static or dynamic properties of the system .",
    "this question naturally arises when the energy spectrum of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite is evaluated for strong electron - photon coupling and photon energy out of resonance with the two atom levels.@xcite in this case a strong negative dispersion is found with increasing atom - photon coupling , but the model was not intended for the off - resonance situation , and it is known that the diamagnetic electron - photon interaction has to be included in a related model of electrons and cavity photons in a short quantum wire.@xcite    we explore these question for the case of a parallel double dot system with two interacting electrons closed with respect to electron exchange with the environment , and compare the results with the situation in which the system is the open version of the model , when it is coupled to two external leads with a bias voltage that promotes current through it .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that the geometry of this particular system furnishes it with very special properties worth studying .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we introduce the components of the static model , the many - body formalism for exactly interacting electrons and cavity photons in a confined system with a continuous geometry describing two parallel dots embedded in a short quantum wire .",
    "we explore its static and dynamics properties with increasing electron - photon interaction .",
    "the dynamic properties are obtained by observing the response of the system to an excitation with an external classical electric dipole pulse of short duration .",
    "we then proceed to open the system up to transport by coupling it to two external electron leads and investigate the effects of varying the electron - photon interaction on the time - dependent currents to and from the system , the charge in it , and its distribution through it .",

    "the entity , two electrons dressed by cavity photons , appears as a quasiparticle with different properties in different `` setups '' .    in our parallel double dot system",

    "this is not a universal behavior as can be seen for two electrons in a quantum wire without the embedded dots.@xcite we conclude thus that the effects of the photon field in the cavity could not generally be described by a constant renormalization of the dielectric constant of the surrounding material .",
    "we find that in our transport setup the photon field enhances the coulomb repulsion of the two electrons in a parallel double quantum dot .",
    "this is true for initial states below , in , or above the bias window , as the coupling to the leads at @xmath54 and the photon field enables slight coupling to states higher in the energy spectrum , and particularly to a one - electron state lower in the spectrum , i.e.  the one - photon replica of the one - electron ground state .    in the closed system , in equilibrium , when gauged through the extent of the charge densities of the two - electron states , the effective interaction of the two electrons is increased , or left untouched . on the other hand , when probed by observing the dispersion of the internal collective oscillation modes , excited by a weak classical electric dipole pulse , the effective interaction of the two electrons is reduced , or left unaffected .",
    "when we observe the strengthening of the repulsion between the two electrons due to the dressing of their mutual interaction by the cavity photon field it is seen by the spreading of the charge ( or polarization ) , but in the case of the transient transport we have to bear in mind the influence of occupation of states with one more or less electron than the initial state had .",
    "a clear exception to the enhancement of the repulsive interaction by the electron photon coupling in the present model is the softening of the relative component of the collective oscillation mode as measured by the fourier transform of the expectation values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ absorption ] . here ,",
    "[ state-61 ] compared to fig .",
    "[ d0 ] indeed shows that in addition to a spreading of the charge density both in @xmath27- and @xmath44-direction we see a very small accumulation of charge between the quantum dots during the oscillations .",
    "this is valid for both linear polarization of the photon field in the @xmath27- and @xmath44-direction .",
    "the charge densities show a quadrupole oscillation that is facilitated by the two terms of the electron - photon coupling thus resulting in a softening of the mode with higher coupling .",
    "the fourier transform of the dipole response as measured by @xmath100 and @xmath101 is much less affected by the coupling giving weight to our argument that the softening of the relative mode can be referred to the interaction between the electrons .",
    "one can wonder if the changes in the effective electron - electron interaction observed here can be attributed to the pauli principle and would thus also be seen in noninteracting systems .",
    "we are sure the electron - photon interaction would have effects on electrons that were not coulomb interacting , but that could be explained as the emergence of an electron - electron interaction . generally , it is impossible to distinguish effects caused by changes in the structure of the state space and the underlying wavefunctions . one",
    "might even ask if such an attempt would depend on the basis used .",
    "an increasing complexity of a state space can be used to describe the geometry of a system .",
    "the system we explore here is a complex system with many parameters requiring long cpu - time on parallel facilities .",
    "we find dispersion of the energy of the two - electron states indicating increased repulsion with stronger electron - photon coupling .",
    "as mentioned before this is not always the case for two - electron systems in a photon cavity.@xcite we are not only gauging these systems in their equilibrium and it is likely that variants with different geometry can sustain different collective modes leading to a reduction of the effective electron - electron interaction as we have found here .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at two different points in the model we are witnessing an effective light - light scattering or interactions .",
    "first , through the dressing of the electrons by the cavity photons as the coulomb interaction of the electrons is also mediated by photons .",
    "second , the diamagnetic electron - photon interaction necessary here is essentially a nonrelativistic light - light interaction that in solid state systems can lead to nonlinear effects for much lower strength than is needed in a vacuum treated relativistically .",
    "the steady state in the open system only depends on the location of the bias window in the energy spectrum of the system and the coupling strength .",
    "it would thus be independent of the initial number of photons in the cavity .",
    "our results for the transient regime depend on the initial number of photons and electrons in addition to the location of the bias window , though we have verified that our finding here is valid for an initial state with few photons ( 0 - 2 ) .",
    "we are describing a system with electron states , coupled to photons , that can have very different coupling to the leads due to their geometry making the estimation of the time needed to reach a steady state difficult .",
    "this together with the fact that conceivably some quantum electro - optical devices might be operated in the late transient time in order to save time and reduce dephasing lets us focus on that regime .",

    "<S> this can be understood in terms of the cavity photons dressing the polarization terms in the effective mutual electron interaction leading to nontrivial delocalization or polarization of the charge in the double parallel dot potential . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the effective repulsion of the electrons can be reduced by quadrupolar collective oscillations excited by an external classical dipole electric field . </S>"
