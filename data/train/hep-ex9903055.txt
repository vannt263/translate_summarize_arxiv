    "polarized deep inelastic scattering is a powerful tool for studying the internal spin structure of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "early results obtained by experiments at slac  @xcite and cern  @xcite indicated that quarks contribute very little to the nucleon s spin .",
    "this contradicted expectations of the naive quark - parton model , and led to the so - called spin crisis .",
    "additional theoretical and experimental studies followed , resulting in a richer view of the nucleon .",
    "experiments at cern  @xcite , slac  @xcite , and desy  @xcite have provided increasing levels of precision and enabled the determination of polarized parton distribution functions using next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculations and the ( altarelli - parisi or dglap ) evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the e155 experiment at slac was , for both the proton and deuteron , to make a precision measurement of @xmath0 covering a wide kinematic range .",
    "to study the internal spin structure of the nucleons , the slac experiments have used the inclusive deep inelastic scattering of a polarized electron beam incident on a fixed polarized nucleon target .",
    "the kinematics of a scattering event are determined by the incident electron energy ( @xmath10 ) and the energy ( @xmath11 ) and angle ( @xmath12 ) of the scattered electron with respect to the incident beam direction .",
    "the event kinematics are described by the 4-momentum transfer squared @xmath13 , and the bjorken scaling variable @xmath14 .",
    "the bjorken scaling variable gives the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the struck quark .    in the unpolarized case , the cross - section for inclusive measurements is related to the unpolarized structure functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the polarized case ,",
    "the difference between cross - sections for anti - aligned versus aligned electron spins ( denoted @xmath17 ) and nucleon spins ( denoted @xmath18 ) is given by @xmath19 \\label{eq : parallel_diff}\\ ] ] for the case of longitudinal polarization of the target , and by @xmath20 \\label{eq : perp_diff}\\ ] ] for the case of transverse polarization of the target , where @xmath21 is the nucleon mass and @xmath22 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the notation @xmath23 ( and similarly for other cases ) is used below .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : parallel_diff ] ) and  ( [ eq : perp_diff ] ) introduce the spin structure functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these functions differ for the various targets ( proton @xmath26 , neutron @xmath27 , and deuteron @xmath28 ) , but are related by @xmath29 .",
    "the factor @xmath30 corrects for the d - state probability of the deuteron ,",
    "@xmath31  =  0.05@xmath320.01 .",
    "this probability is treated as a constant with respect to bjorken @xmath8 .    since in both cases on the left hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : parallel_diff ] ) and  ( [ eq : perp_diff ] ) the cross - sections are nearly equal , to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 by measuring the cross - sections and taking the differences would require detailed and accurate knowledge of detector acceptance and efficiency .",
    "instead , the spin structure functions are obtained by measuring asymmetries , where these common factors divide out .    measuring cross - section asymmetries @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 yields the polarized structure functions via @xmath36 \\hspace{3em}{\\mathrm and}\\hspace{3em }   g_2 = { f_1 \\over d^\\prime } { y \\over 2 \\sin\\theta }   \\left(- a_\\| \\sin\\theta + a_\\bot { e_0 + e^\\prime \\cos \\theta \\over e^\\prime}\\right ) \\ , .\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath15 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 above are all functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the kinematic variables used in the above expression are determined from @xmath10 and either @xmath37 or @xmath38 as follows : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "@xmath15 was calculated from fits to world data on @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath44 @xcite .    in leading order @xmath0",
    "is only sensitive to the net quark polarizations .",
    "however , in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xmath0 is also sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution @xmath45 through the @xmath46 evolution of the polarized parton distributions .",
    "this evolution is governed by the altarelli - parisi ( or dglap ) evolution equations@xcite and reflects the increasing resolution of deep inelastic scattering with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "one important consequence of this evolution is to link the quark distributions to the gluon distributions through g @xmath47 gq splitting .",
    "this makes it possible to indirectly measure the gluon distributions by measuring the quark distributions over a wide range in @xmath46 .",
    "given sufficient statistical power over a wide range in @xmath8 and @xmath46 , nlo pqcd analysis of the @xmath46 dependence of @xmath48 can be used to constrain the net polarization of the gluon .",
    "although the naive picture of the @xmath1 structure function is unclear , twist-2 calculations from wandzura and wilczek  @xcite provide a relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 : @xmath49 more generally , @xmath25 can be written as @xmath50 , where the second and third terms are twist-2 and twist-3 , respectively .",
    "the experiment e155 ran in early 1997 and collected @xmath51180 million deep inelastic scattering electron events .",
    "keys to the success of e155 included : the high intensity , highly - polarized beam ; the use of lithium deuteride as the deuteron target material ; and the construction of a third spectrometer .",
    "longitudinally polarized 48.3 gev electron beam pulses @xcite of up to 400 ns duration were produced at 120  hz by a circularly polarized laser beam illuminating a strained gaas photocathode . the beam polarization @xmath52=0.810",
    "@xmath32  0.020 was determined using mller scattering from 20154 @xmath53 m thick fe - co - v polarized foils  @xcite .",
    "two polarized nucleon target materials were used in e155 : ammonia ( @xmath2nh@xmath54 ) as a proton target ; and lithium deuteride ( @xmath4li@xmath7h , or @xmath4lid )  @xcite as a deuteron target . as in e143  @xcite ,",
    "polarization of the target materials was obtained using the technique of dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) . in this technique , a combination of microwaves ( @xmath51140  ghz ) , low temperature ( 1  k ) , and a high magnetic field ( 5  t ) polarizes paramagnetic electron centers in the target material , and transfers that polarization to the nucleons .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements were made using coils embedded in the target materials to determine the polarization at regular intervals .",
    "these measurements were calibrated to the signal measured at thermal equilibrium near 1.6 k  @xcite .",
    "the polarizations slowly decreased over time due to radiation damage , and were restored by periodic annealing at about 80  k for the nh@xmath3 target and 185  k for the lid . as compared to deuterated ammonia ( @xmath2nd@xmath54 ) , lithium deuteride provides a larger ratio of polarized ( effective ) deuterons to the total number of nucleons as well as higher radiation resistance .",
    "the @xmath4li can , to first order , be treated as a polarized deuteron plus an unpolarized alpha particle , and therefore half of the nucleons in @xmath4lid are the desired polarizable species .",
    "average polarizations of @xmath55 80% for the proton target and @xmath55 22% for the deuteron target were achieved .",
    "overall relative uncertainties on p@xmath56 of 6% ( preliminary ) and 4% were obtained for the proton and deuteron respectively .",
    "scattered electrons were detected in three independent magnetic spectrometers at central angles of 2.75@xmath57 , 5.5@xmath57 , and 10.5@xmath57 with respect to the incident beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrometers ] .",
    "the spectrometers at 2.75@xmath58 and 5.5@xmath58 were used previously in the experiment e154  @xcite . in each spectrometer , electrons were identified by threshold gas cherenkov counters and a total absorbing lead glass electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "particle momenta and scattering angles were measured with sets of scintillator hodoscopes .",
    "the 10.5@xmath57 spectrometer was added for e155 to double the @xmath46 range of the experiment .",
    "the experimental asymmetries were determined from the numbers of scattered electrons per incident beam charge for negative and positive beam helicity for each target , divided by the beam and target polarizations .",
    "the rates were corrected for contributions from charge symmetric background processes , which were measured by reversing the spectrometer polarities .",
    "corrections were also included for mis - identified hadrons , which were typically 2% or less of the electron candidates .",
    "also , a dilution factor accounted for the fraction of events originating from the polarizable protons or free deuterons , as opposed to the other materials in the target .",
    "the average dilution factor for the proton target was 0.15 , for the deuteron target 0.19 .",
    "nuclear correction factors accounted for the presence of several polarizable nuclear species in the target . for the proton , a small correction was made for the polarization of the nitrogen nuclei .",
    "for the deuteron , the measured asymmetry included contributions from the free deuterons and effective deuterons in @xmath59li .",
    "the effective deuteron in @xmath4li has a net polarization of 87% of the @xmath4li polarization  @xcite , which leads to an effective dilution factor of @xmath510.36 for @xmath59lid , as compared with @xmath510.22 for @xmath2nd@xmath54 .",
    "the measured deuteron asymmetries also were corrected for small contributions from polarized protons in li@xmath60h and @xmath61li .",
    "both internal @xcite and external @xcite radiative corrections were obtained using an iterative global fit of all data , including e155 .",
    "previous slac data were recorrected in a manner consistent with the e155 corrections .",
    "the e155 proton results are plotted as @xmath62 vs.@xmath63@xmath9 in fig .  [",
    "fig : fanplot ] . there is a remarkable agreement between the many experiments .",
    "the world data on @xmath62 exhibit a clear @xmath9 dependence , and the scaling violation is similar in character to that of the unpolarized structure functions . at low @xmath8 ,",
    "the spin structure function increases with @xmath9 , and at high @xmath8 it decreases with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "the e155 deuteron results  @xcite are presented as @xmath64/@xmath65 vs.@xmath63@xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2dep ] .",
    "they are also in good agreement with world data , and the data from the three spectrometers provide both large @xmath46 coverage and good statistical resolution in the mid-@xmath8 region .",
    "there is no significant @xmath46 dependence for @xmath66 , and likewise @xmath67 , indicating that the polarized and unpolarized structure functions evolve similarly .",
    "evolving the data to a common @xmath9 by use of a functional fit to world @xmath0 data , and integrating over the kinematic @xmath8 range of e155 yields preliminary results for @xmath68  ( gev / c)@xmath7 : @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "the extrapolations for the unmeasured high @xmath8 region are negligible .",
    "however , the contribution from the low @xmath8 region below 0.014 does not converge for the functional fit , reinforcing the need for additional data at very low @xmath8 .",
    "using the e154 @xcite pqcd fit to calculate the contribution for the low @xmath8 region gives values : @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where again the first error is statistical , the second is systematic , and the third error is a theory error .",
    "these values can be combined to obtain a preliminary e155 result for the bjorken sum rule  @xcite , @xmath73 .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical prediction at @xmath68  ( gev / c)@xmath7 , @xmath74 , which includes third order qcd corrections  @xcite , using @xmath75  @xcite .    using the published nlo pqcd fit methods of e154  @xcite , but including final smc results  @xcite and preliminary e155 results in the data set , polarized parton distributions were extracted .",
    "the eight - parameter fit had a @xmath76/d.o.f .",
    "of 206/210 . from the parton distributions ,",
    "the following preliminary integral results are obtained at @xmath68  ( gev / c)@xmath7 , in the @xmath77 scheme : @xmath78 = @xmath79 , @xmath80 = @xmath81 , and @xmath82 = @xmath83 , where the first errors are statistical and the second systematic , and similarly sized theory errors are ignored .",
    "the bjorken sum rule result is again consistent with the theoretical prediction .",
    "additionally , the fit polarized parton distributions yield the preliminary results : @xmath84 = @xmath85 and @xmath86 = @xmath87 .",
    "the data indicate that the gluon contribution to nucleon spin @xmath45 is positive , but do not constrain the value well .",
    "the data do well constrain the quark spin contribution @xmath88 , and it is smaller than predicted naively or by the ellis - jaffe sum rule  @xcite .",
    "e155 ran for a short period during the 1997 run at 38.8 gev beam energy with the target polarization transverse to the beam direction .",
    "results for the @xmath1 structure function obtained from this data  @xcite are shown ( as @xmath89 ) in fig  [ fig : xg2 ] .",
    "the data from the three spectrometers show no @xmath46 dependence to the virtual photon - nucleon asymmetry @xmath90 within uncertainties , so the data from the individual spectrometers have been combined .",
    "the data are consistent with @xmath91 , and satisfy the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule  @xcite within errors .",
    "however , the current results lack the power to differentiate among @xmath91 , model predictions @xcite , and @xmath92 .",
    "this will be addressed by the much larger data set planned for the e155 extension run ( march - may 1999 ) , which will focus on measurements with the target polarization perpendicular to the beam direction in order to make a high precision measurement of the @xmath1 structure function .",
    "the data from this run will significantly improve knowledge of @xmath1 and will definitively distinguish between @xmath1  =  0 and @xmath91 ."
