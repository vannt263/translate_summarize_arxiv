    "ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) were first identified over a decade ago ( hilker et al . 1999 ; drinkwater et al . 2000 ) , but whether they should be considered as galaxies or massive star clusters is still uncertain ( e.g. hasegan et al .",
    "2005 ; mieske et al . 2009 ; hilker 2009 ; forbes & kroupa 2011 ; willman & strader 2012 ) .",
    "brodie et al .",
    "( 2011 ) adopted a working definition for ucds to have half - light sizes of @xmath13  pc and @xmath14  mag ( with no upper limit on luminosity ) .",
    "the two main formation channels discussed in the literature are variations of merged star clusters or stripped dwarf galaxies @xcite . in this sense their current size and luminosity are thought to be the result of a ` bottom - up ' growth from lower masses , or a ` top - down ' evolution from higher masses .",
    "support for the idea of both formation channels for ucds comes from the results of norris & kannappan ( 2011 ) .",
    "they found many ucds to be consistent with high mass globular clusters .",
    "however , they also reported one ucd around ngc 4546 that was in a counter - rotating orbit with respect to the host galaxy and its globular cluster system",
    ". furthermore , they calculated that the ucd had a very short dynamical friction timescale .",
    "this strongly suggested that it had been recently captured and was not part of the galaxy s original gc system .",
    "evidence for ucds forming as massive star clusters in the nearby universe was presented by penny et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who found young , blue candidate ucds with ( @xmath15)@xmath16  mag in the perseus cluster associated with gas filaments around the cluster s central galaxy ngc 1275 .",
    "ngc1275 therefore provides a location in which to study the formation of massive star clusters and proto - ucds in the nearby universe .",
    "if these massive blue star clusters are able to remain bound against the cluster tidal potential , they will be seen as typical red ucds once their stellar populations fade in a timescale of @xmath17  myr .    using a state - of - the - art compilation of pressure - supported systems with old stellar populations , brodie et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that ucds had a tight colour - magnitude relation that was different from normal globular clusters .",
    "this , and kinematic differences , argued against the merged star cluster scenario .",
    "however , they also found that ucds do not have a well - defined size - luminosity distribution as might have been expected in the stripping scenario @xcite .",
    "a further expectation of the stripping scenario is that the remnants come from a range of progenitor masses .",
    "hence we would expect a continuity of objects between the most massive ucds and compact ellipticals ( ces ) , the latter of which are thought to be the tidally stripped remnant of a normal galaxy ( faber 1973 ) .",
    "such intermediate mass objects are too massive to be explained as merged star clusters .    in the compilation of brodie",
    "et al . ( 2011 ) , their figure 8 shows very few objects with confirmed sizes and luminosities intermediate between those of ucds and ces .",
    "one such object is m59co highlighted by chilingarian & mamon ( 2008 ) as a `` missing link '' between ucds and ces .",
    "this object , with a confirmed velocity placing it in the virgo cluster , has @xmath18  mag ( @xmath19 @xmath20  mag ) .",
    "a dual sersic fit to the surface brightness profile gave a ` nucleus ' of half - light radius @xmath21  pc with an extended component of @xmath22  pc .",
    "the object was also found to be old and relatively metal - rich .",
    "another extreme ucd in the virgo cluster , m60-ucd1 @xcite with @xmath23  mag and a dynamical mass @xmath24  m@xmath7 is the densest galaxy identified to date , and occupies the region of size - magnitude space between the most massive globular clusters and the faintest compact elliptical galaxies .    in this work we present the results of a keck deimos follow - up study of ucd candidates in the nearby perseus cluster ( @xmath25  mpc ) identified in @xcite out to 250  kpc from the cluster centre .",
    "the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) is the unusual ngc 1275 , which is actively accreting / disrupting satellite galaxies at the present time , making perseus an ideal environment in which to study the formation of ucds as disrupted des vs. massive star clusters .",
    "the focus on this paper is the origin of ucds in clusters- are they massive star clusters or the cores of tidally stripped galaxies ?",
    "in particular we examine on the origin of the largest perseus ucd , ucd13 , via its size , kinematics , cluster location and stellar population .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] , we describe our observations and their reduction . in section  [ perucd ]",
    "we briefly discuss the properties of the confirmed perseus cluster members , including the size luminosity distribution for ucds .",
    "an analysis of ucd13 is presented in section  [ ucd13 ] , with a tidal stripping formation scenario for ucd13 examined in section  [ sec : ucd13 ] .",
    "a star cluster origin for ucd13 is discussed in section  [ starcluster ] .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] , and present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in @xcite , from hst acs wfc imaging we identified 84 candidate ucds in the perseus cluster core using two fields in the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) bands , along with five fields in the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) bands . these ucd candidates were selected based on their sizes alone ( @xmath34 ) , with no colour or luminosity cuts placed on their selection . instead ,",

    "these observations provide spectral coverage from @xmath40   to 7250   for the blue chip , and 7500   to 9200   for the red chip , covering both the h@xmath41 and calcium ii triplet ( cat ) absorption features at the redshift of perseus ( @xmath42  km  s@xmath1 , struble & rood 1999 ) .",
    "we targeted 37  ucd candidates in the perseus cluster core for spectroscopy .",
    "the deimos data were reduced using the idl spec2d pipeline .",
    "the data were flatfielded , wavelength calibrated using arkrnexe arcs , and sky - subtracted , and 14 ucd candidates emerged with sufficient signal - to - noise to determine reliable redshifts .",
    "radial velocities were measured using the iraf procedure fxcor .",
    "example spectra for two ucds ( ucd13 and ucd25 ) are shown in figure  [ twospecs ] .",
    "it can be seen that the cat  3 line for ucd13 is affected by sky lines , so can not be used in the velocity dispersion determination as described in section  [ sec : ce ] .",
    "the ucd spectra were matched to vazdekis ( 2003 ) model spectra with a range of ages and metallicities , covering both the h@xmath41 and cat regions .",

    ", in prep .    to help establish if this object is the stripped remnant of a much larger system , we measure its internal velocity dispersion using the penalised pixel fitting ( ppxf ) routine ( cappellari & emsellem , 2004 ) .",
    "the instrumental velocity dispersion is confirmed using two stellar spectra that were taken as serendipitous observations during the deimos observations ( these stars fell into the slits of our target objects ) .",
    "we measure ucd13 to have an internal velocity dispersion @xmath45  km  s@xmath1 , determined from the cat  1 and cat  2 lines , and confirmed using the h@xmath41 line .",

    "using an effective radius @xmath49  pc as found for a single profile fit , we obtain @xmath50  km  s@xmath1 .",

    "using the virial theorem with a correction for the srsic profile shape provided in @xcite , this gives us a dynamical mass for the object of @xmath52  m@xmath12 .",
    "we estimate a stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath53 ) using the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "we assume a salpeter imf , an old stellar population with an age of 10  gyr , and a metallicity [ z / h ]  @xmath54  dex , comparable to the ucd s metallicity presented in section  [ metal ] . based on this , we find a @xmath27-band @xmath53 of @xmath55 .",
    "the absolute @xmath27-band magnitude of ucd13 ( @xmath56  mag ) is converted to a solar luminosity and then multiplied by the stellar @xmath53 , giving a stellar mass for the object of @xmath57  m@xmath7 .",
    "this gives @xmath58 of 4.5 .",
    "however , the imf for ucds may be better described by a kroupa imf ( e.g. @xcite ) . using a kroupa imf with [ z / h]@xmath54  dex and an old stellar population",
    ", the @xmath27-band stellar mass - to - light ratio will decrease to 3.66 , resulting in @xmath58 = 7.2 .",
    "both results for @xmath58 are inconsistent with a highly dark matter dominated object .",
    "we use the method of @xcite to measure the metallicity of ucd13 from the strength of the near infrared calcium triplet spectral feature .",
    "sensitive to metallicity and insensitive to ages older than 3 gyr @xcite , the strength of cat is independent of @xmath41-element enhancement and horizontal branch morphology @xcite .",
    "however the strength of the cat is dependent on the imf as the cat is weaker in a stellar population with a bottom heavy imf , such as those found in massive early type galaxies by @xcite , than in a population with a kroupa imf and the same metallicity @xcite .    to remove the effect of strong sky line residuals on the cat measurement , we mask the sky line regions and fit a linear combination of stellar templates to the observed spectrum .",
    "we then measure the strength of cat on the fitted spectrum and use a monte carlo resampling technique to estimate a confidence interval on the measured line strength .",
    "lastly we use the single stellar population models of @xcite to convert the line strength into a metallicity . see @xcite for further details of the metallicity measurement process .",
    "we measure a metallicity of [ z / h ] @xmath59  dex from the strength of the cat . using the gc colour  metallicity relation of @xcite",
    "we derive a colour based metallicity of [ z / h ] = @xmath60  dex , consistent with the cat based metallicity .",
    "the metallicity and other properties of ucd13 measured in this work are summarised in table  [ props ] , along with three comparison objects from the literature ( m59co , @xcite ; vucd7 , @xcite ; and m60-ucd1 , @xcite ) .",
    "could ucd13 be the tidal remnant of a once much larger galaxy ?",
    "ucd13 has a velocity @xmath61  km  s@xmath1 , compared to @xmath62  km  s@xmath1 for ngc  1275 @xcite . at an angular separation of @xmath63 ,",
    "ucd13 and ngc 1275 have a minimum physical separation of 30  kpc .",
    "such conditions are highly favourable for galaxy - galaxy interactions and tidal stripping .",
    "ngc1275 furthermore exhibits a shall structure consistent with the bcg actively disrupting and accreting lower mass galaxies today ( e.g. penny et al . , 2011 ) , and ucd13 s progenitor likely contributed to these shells .",
    "it is therefore highly likely the two objects are interacting given their small radial velocity separation of @xmath64  km  s@xmath1 and close physical proximity , so we examine ucd13 for features that might indicate that it is a ucd formed via the tidal stripping of a low mass galaxy .      when a galaxy is tidally stripped , its effective radius and luminosity will be reduced , but its central velocity dispersion and central metallicity will remain largely unchanged from those of its progenitor @xcite . as the tidal remnant relaxes after stripping , its effective radius will increase slightly , causing its central velocity dispersion to decrease ,",
    "however this effect will be small .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that for a disc galaxy , the stellar disc of the galaxy will be heavily stripped , and its central velocity @xmath47 will decrease by @xmath65  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this decrease in velocity dispersion is within our error bar of @xmath66  km  s@xmath1 , and we can assume that the progenitor and remnant galaxies will have the same value of @xmath47 .    for the tidal stripping of a nucleated de with a fragile stellar envelope ( i.e. most of its mass",
    "is located in its central regions ) , we hypothesise than this decrease in @xmath47 will be even smaller .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ msig ] , at a given magnitude des exhibit a scatter in their measured internal velocity dispersions , with @xmath47 ranging from @xmath67 km  s@xmath1 to @xmath68  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "any decrease in @xmath47 resulting from the tidal transformation of a de to a ucd given our measured value of @xmath69  km  s@xmath1 will fall within this range .",
    "we can therefore use our measurement of ucd13 s central velocity dispersion to characterise the nature of its progenitor .",
    "old , pressure supported galaxies follow a well - defined relation between @xmath46 and luminosity : the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) .",
    "however , the slope of this relation is observed to change in the dwarf elliptical regime , from @xmath70 for giant ellipticals , to @xmath71 for des @xcite .",
    "this allows us to more easily separate the kinematics of giants and dwarf ellipticals .",
    "we can therefore use the luminosity - sigma relation to estimate the mass of the progenitor of ucd13 by examining its location on the velocity dispersion ",

    "[ msig ] ) . we can rule out ucd13 as currently being a dsph with a high surface brightness core , as its velocity dispersion is higher than that of dsph galaxies of comparable magnitude . in the local group , fornax , sculptor and leo",
    "i have have luminosities comparable to ucd13 ( @xmath73 ) , but central velocity dispersions @xmath74  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the ucd s @xmath47 is too low for it to be the remnant of a low - mass elliptical galaxy or bulge .",
    "we confirm the luminosity of ucd13 s progenitor by utilising the relations of @xcite .",
    "using the relations presented in their figures 4 and 5 , @xmath75  km  s@xmath1 corresponds to a galaxy with @xmath76  mag and @xmath77  mag .",
    "ucd13 has @xmath78  mag , in strong agreement with this predicted progenitor colour . therefore ,",
    "based on colour and internal velocity dispersion , the progenitor of ucd13 is likely a dwarf elliptical galaxy with @xmath79  mag .",
    "we should note than an internal velocity dispersion of @xmath80  km  s@xmath1 is not inconsistent with the velocity dispersion - magnitude relation for massive star clusters .",
    "however , the size of ucd13 ( @xmath81  pc ) is higher than that expected for an extended star cluster with a comparable @xmath47 . despite having a higher velocity dispersion of @xmath82  km  s@xmath1 ,",
    "the massive luminous star cluster w3 has a size @xmath83  pc , one - fifth the size of ucd13 . for a comparable central velocity dispersion ,",
    "massive star clusters are more compact than ucd13 .",
    "a massive star cluster origin for ucd13 is examined in detail in section  [ starcluster ] .",
    "the surface brightness distributions of des are generally well fitted by an exponential @xmath84 srsic profile , while the light distributions of giant ellipticals closely follow a de vaucouleurs profile with a srsic index @xmath85 .",
    "although the luminosities of ces frequently overlap those of des ( @xmath86 ) , the compact ellipticals are easily separated from des due to their concentrated light distributions from a single srsic profile fit , with @xmath87 . with @xmath88 from a single profile srsic fit , ucd13 has a concentrated light distribution resembling that of a typical compact elliptical galaxy .    to establish",
    "if the object s large size and luminosity could be the result of the tidal stripping of a de , in fig  [ sizemag ] we include for comparison a sample of de nuclei from @xcite .",
    "ucd13 is more extended than a de nucleus of comparable magnitude by a factor of 10 .",
    "@xcite find a comparable result for ucds in the fornax and virgo clusters , with ucds having effective radii larger than @xmath89  pc , twice the size of those of early - type de nuclei at the same luminosity .",
    "however , during a tidal stripping event , the nucleus may be able to retain or re - accrete some of its envelope of tidally stripped stars .",
    "if a stripped de is able to retain some of its stellar envelope in addition to its nucleus , the resulting ucd will be more extended than a de nucleus alone .",
    "@xcite show that ucds with sizes @xmath90  pc can be formed from the tidal stripping of a nucleated de if the de has a small pericentric approach ( @xmath91  kpc ) from the perturbing galaxy",
    ". the de must be on a highly elliptical orbit , and must be on its first or second approach for such a transformation to occur . in their simulations , this scenario produces extended ucds with sizes @xmath3  pc .",
    "the resulting ucds consist not only of the remnant de nucleus , but also some of the de s retained stellar envelope .    given its close proximity to ngc 1275 ( @xmath92  kpc ) and small separation in radial velocity ( @xmath64  km  s@xmath1 )",
    ", ucd13 would currently be near the apocentre of a radial orbit , else we are observing its orbit face - on ( such an orbit could still be a radial ) .",
    "if ucd13 is indeed at an orbit apocentre @xmath92  kpc after several pericentric approaches to ngc 1275 , dynamical friction will have decayed its original highly elliptical orbit into a circular one , as predicted in the simulations of @xcite . therefore a de stripping scenario is a feasible explanation for its origin .      assuming a de rather than a massive cluster origin for ucd13",
    ", we proceed to examine the mass - metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies to estimate the mass of the ucd s progenitor .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation for galaxies presented in figure  6 of @xcite shows that a galaxy with [ z / h]@xmath93  dex has a mass @xmath94  m@xmath7 .",
    "this mass is comparable to that of a de with @xmath72 , in agreement with the result using the faber - jackson relation presented in section  [ sec : vlrel ] .",
    "a galaxy - like central bulge with a stellar envelope as exhibited by ucd13 ( fig .",
    "[ ucd13 ] ) does not necessarily exclude a massive star cluster origin .",
    "the simulations of @xcite showed that ucds with diffuse stellar envelopes similar to that observed for ucd13 can be formed when massive ( @xmath95  m@xmath12 ) star cluster complexes merge .",
    "such objects will have circular isophotes in their inner regions , with their ellipticities increasing at large radii .",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath96  mag as the upper magnitude limit for ucds formed as giant globular clusters , with ucd13 approaching this magnitude limit assuming @xmath97 , a typical value for ucds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "multiple mergers between multiple massive star clusters would be required to reach this size , and the simulations of @xcite are able to form ucds via this method .",
    "ucds formed out of a merged star cluster complex would have a core of merged star clusters , with an envelope of stripped stars lost during the merger of the star clusters- similar in morphology to ucd13 .",
    "the intermediate age star cluster w3 ( @xmath98  pc ) in the merger remnant ngc  7252 is likely a ucd - like object @xcite recently formed via this method .",
    "however , its size is only one - quarter that of ucd13 , so it is unclear if massive star clusters such as w3 are the same class of objects as the most extended ucds .",
    "we therefore examine the sizes of massive star clusters surrounding ngc  1275 ( e.g. @xcite ) to address this question .",
    "ngc  1275 is surrounded by a complex system of filaments , a number of which host regions of active star formation .",
    "these star forming regions are hypothesised as a region of ucd formation , with several proto - ucds located in these filaments exhibiting @xmath99 colours @xmath100 , implying ages @xmath101  myr . however , the sizes of these young ucd - like star clusters are far smaller than that found for ucd13 , with the largest blue ucd , ucd29 , having a size @xmath102  pc @xcite . instead",
    ", objects such as ucd13 are more likely to form in lower density regions of the cluster .",

    "@xcite showed that a number of young , massive star clusters in the star forming filaments surrounding ngc  1275 are being tidally stripped and will eventually fall into the galaxy s nucleus , and thus ngc  1275 s filaments may not be an ideal location for forming more extended ucds via star cluster mergers .",
    "mergers between multiple massive young , ucd - sized star clusters are required to produce an extended object such as ucd13 .",
    "a star - cluster merger formation scenario for ucd13 therefore seems unlikely .",

    "the ucd population in perseus may have multiple origins .",
    "ucds with smaller effective radii are likely an extension of the globular cluster system to higher magnitudes and sizes .",
