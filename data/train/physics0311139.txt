    "sparnaay s 1958 experiments [ 1 ] exposed the existence of zero - point radiation , which nernst had considered as a possibility in 1916 .",
    "however , sparnaay was not looking for it , since he was only trying to check casimir s hypothesis about the mutual attraction of two uncharged conductor plates placed very close together [ 2 ] .",
    "this attraction should have disappeared when the temperature approached absolute zero , but sparnaay found that at near that temperature there was still some attraction not accounted for by casimir s hypothesis , being independent of temperature and obeying a very simple law ; it is directly proportional to the surface of the plates , and inversely proportional to the 4@xmath7 power of the distance @xmath8 between them .",
    "sparnaay observed this force when the plates were placed in a very complete vacuum at near zero - absolute temperature . for a distance of @xmath9 cm between the plates",
    ", he was able to measure a force of @xmath10 , and deduced the formula @xmath11    in a near - perfect vacuum and at a temperature very near absolute zero , which implies the absence of any  photon gas \" , the phenomenon observed by sparnaay could only be produced by a radiation inherent to space .",
    "this could be only the case if its spectrum is relativistically invariant , which could only happen if its spectral distribution is inversely proportional to the cubes of the wavelengths in other words , if the number of photons of wavelength @xmath12 which strike a given area within a given time is inversely proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "a function of spectral distribution which is inversely proportional to the cubes of the wavelengths , implies a distribution of energies which is inversely proportional to the 4@xmath7 power of the wavelengths , because the energies of the photons are inversely proportional to the wavelengths . in 1969 , timothy h. boyer [ 4 ] showed that the spectral density function of zero - point radiation is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number giving the measurement of wavelength @xmath12 .",
    "this function produces the next , for the corresponding energies @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "there must therefore be a threshold for @xmath12 , which will hereafter be designated by the symbol @xmath1 .    in the sparnaay effect , the presence of a force which is inversely proportional to the 4@xmath7 power of the distance @xmath8 between the plates , while the distribution of energies is also inversely proportional to the 4@xmath7 power of the wavelengths , leads us to infer that the cause of the apparent attraction must lie in some factor which varies inversely with the wavelength , and which causes a behaviour different from the photons of wavelengths equal to or greater than @xmath8 , since : @xmath19    the factor in question turns out to be the proportion of photons which are reflected , not absorbed ; that is the coefficient of reflection @xmath20 , while the different behaviour is caused by the obstacle which the presence of each one of the two plates offers to the reflection from the inner face of the other one , of photons of wavelength equal or greater than  @xmath8 \" . as we know , the energy which is transferred by a reflected photon is double that transferred by one which is absorbed .    to simplify the following arguments , it is convenient to use the @xmath21 system of measurements in which the basic magnitudes are the quantum of electric charge , the mass of the electron and the speed of light . in this system ,",
    "the units of length and time are respectively @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the results of sparnaay s experiments provide a link with reality which may be enough to show the intensity of the energy flow belonging to zero - point radiation . a recent paper [ 5 ]",
    "has shown that this flow is one which corresponds to the incidence in an area @xmath24 of one photon of wavelength @xmath1 every @xmath25 , plus one photon of wavelength @xmath26 every @xmath27 , etc . up to one photon of wavelength @xmath28 every @xmath29 , where @xmath30 [ 6 ] .",
    "this radiation implies the energy flow per @xmath24 and @xmath25 which is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 [ 7 ] .",
    "this energy flow produces a force per @xmath33 which is given by @xmath34 which when expressed in the c.g.s .",
    "system and per @xmath35 is given by @xmath36    in cosmic rays , photons have been observed with energies of the order of more than @xmath37  ev , [ 8 ] which implies that the value of @xmath38 must be greater than @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is therefore inmense . in consequence",
    "the analysis of the possible interactions of zero - point radiation with the elementary particles assumes enormous interest .",

    "poincar was the first to point out that this ` something '  must be allowed for in the calculation of energy and momentum \" .",

    ", poincar suggested that something must exist which can counteract this repulsion and this ` something '  has therefore been named ` poincar s tensions ' .",
    "the possible configuration must be one which has no favoured direction , which implies that it must have spherical symmetry .",
    "electrostatic repulsion would appear in the form of a centrifugal force . to meet this",
    ", poincar s tensions would have to be arranged as centripetal forces able to counteract it .",
    "when submitted to these fields of opposing forces , the charge of the electron would tend to distribute itself equally over a spherical surface .",
    "zero - point radiation , which arrives equally from all directions of space , provides centripetal energy flows towards every imaginable spherical surface , and from these flows there could be derived equally centripetal flows , to fill the role of poincar s tensions .",
    "sparnaay s experiments have allowed us to measure the intensity of the energy flows inherent to zero - point radiation ; compton s experiments discovered the laws which govern the phenomena of dispersal and energy transfer produced by the interaction of photons with free particles and matter .",
    "finally the differential cross section for these phenomena follows the klein - nishima - tann formula . with this knowledge we can attempt to calculate the centripetal force which could be produced by the zero - point radiation , on an electron with its charge distributed equally over a spherical surface of radius  @xmath41 .    the collision of a photon with a free particle of matter , shown in fig .",
    "1 , produces the compton effect .",
    "the colliding photon of energy @xmath42 and wavelength @xmath12 , loses part of its energy to the particle , and is diverted at an angle @xmath43 to its previous trajectory .",
    "when losing energy , it increases its wavelength by an amount which is given by compton s equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the said particle mass . for the electron , compton s wavelength @xmath47 .    in the case of zero - point radiation , the free particle of matter , which is subjected to equal forces from all directions , does not move , but suffers compression towards its centre .",
    "the encounter of a photon with an electron does not always produce the compton effect ; the differential cross section for this @xmath48 is given by the klein - nishima - tann formula for dispersal with electrons , which is @xmath49 where @xmath43 is the angle of dispersal , @xmath50 the frequency of the arriving photon , @xmath51 that of the dispersed photon , @xmath52 the classical radius of the electron , @xmath48 is the differential cross section for the compton effect , and @xmath53 . by bringing in this relation and remembering that @xmath54",

    "sparnaay s measurements allow us to deduce that , in the case of photons with wavelength equal to or greater than @xmath79  cm , the energy flow of the zero - point radiation agrees with the energy flow corresponding to the incidence , in an area @xmath24 , of the photon of wavelength @xmath1 every @xmath25 , plus another of wavelength @xmath26 every @xmath27 , up to a photon of wavelength @xmath28 every @xmath29 .",
