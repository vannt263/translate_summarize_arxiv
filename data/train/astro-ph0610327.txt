    "gas temperature and co number density are closely anti - correlated ( -0.86 ) , owing to the strong temperature sensitivity of carbon monoxide .",
    "the cool areas in the middle photosphere allow for formation of more co compared to the hotter `` filamentary '' regions by typically 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "but co is also very abundant in the ( low ) chromosphere above and binds a large fraction of all available carbon atoms there .",

    "due to the continuous passage of these waves the atmosphere can not relax to a cool state ( w06 ) .",
    "the average temperature is only reduced by @xmath14k .    in sharp contrast to the thermal structure of the model chromosphere , the ionisation degree of hydrogen is rather homogeneous in the upper layers at values set by the passing hot wave fronts ( l06 ) .",
    "a similar picture is found for the magnetic field in the chromosphere of internetwork regions that is much more homogeneous and also more dynamic than in the layers below ( s05 ) .",
    "the highly dynamic middle chromosphere seems to be separated from the slower evolving lower layers by the surface of plasma @xmath15 ( at an average height of @xmath161000 km ) . the photospheric field is highly structured with a kind of `` small - scale canopy '' above granule interiors as a result of flux expulsion by the hydrodynamic flow . even a weak initial field of 10 g is sufficient to build up kg flux tubes whereas the field strength above the granule interiors often drops to only @xmath17 g .",

    "the continuum intensity at a wavelength of 500 nm ( fig .",

    "it has an intensity contrast of @xmath18% , whereas the corresponding contrast of the emergent grey intensity is 17% and thus the same as for the 3d hydrodynamic model with grey radiative transfer by w04 .    the caiih line wing intensity ( * ? ?",
    "* ( fig .",
    "[ fig : int]c , see also leenaarts & wedemeyer - bhm 2005 ) ) originates from the middle photosphere and thus shows the same although reversed pattern as the co distribution ( panel b ) .",

    "the intensity at 160 nm is on average formed only a little bit higher in the high photosphere .",
    "in contrast to the caiih line wing map , the intensity image at 160 nm only exhibits the hottest regions of the reversed granulation pattern as the gas temperature translates highly non - linearly into intensity at uv wavelengths .",
    "most of the pattern appears relatively dark and is thus hard to detect so that the hot regions resemble isolated grainy features .",

    "the situation is more complicated for the solar chromosphere as ( i ) meaningful diagnostics are rare and/or hard to interpret and ( ii ) realistic multi - dimensional numerical modelling of this layer is difficult due to many reasons and hardly possible with nowadays computational resources .",
    "the central parts of the caii resonance lines are commonly used as chromospheric diagnostic ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see wger  2006 for a recent example ) ) but are difficult to interpret as the intensity has contributions from a large height range and non - local / non - equilibrium effects have to be taken into account . in contrast",
    ", the gas temperature almost linearly translates into continuum intensity in the ( sub-)millimetre range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : int]f for a continuum intensity map at 1 mm ) .",
    "unfortunately the current instruments are not able to resolve the small spatial scales discussed here ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see , e.g. , white  2006 ) ) .",
    "the future atacama large millimeter array ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( alma , beasley  2006 ) ) , a interferometer with a large number of antennae in the ( sub-)millimetre range , will provide sufficiently high spatial resolution for a detailed comparison with numerical models .",
    "the receivers will cover a wavelength range from 0.3 mm to 9 mm .",
    "the intensity at the different wavelengths originates from different layers from the high photosphere to the middle chromosphere , with the average formation height increasing with wavelength . simultaneous observation at different wavelengths could thus serve as a tomography of the atmosphere , finally allowing for mapping the ( three - dimensional ) thermal structure of the solar chromosphere ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ( loukitcheva  2006 ; wedemeyer - bhm  in prep . ) ) .",
    "the intensity contrast at 1 mm is 23% and thus very similar to the 500 nm continuum .",
    "despite the steady increase in realism many details of the models still have to be taken with caution .",
    "maybe the strongest limitation is the assumption of lte ( in particular for the radiative transfer ) which was necessary to keep the problem computationally tractable so far .",
    "lte is also assumed in the `` post - simulation '' radiative transfer calculations with .",
    "the extension to a more realistic non - lte treatment in both the simulation and the intensity / spectrum synthesis will be an important point to work on in future .",
    "consequently , the temperature amplitudes of the current model chromosphere might still be uncertain to some extent .",
    "nevertheless this class of models can give important hints for the interpretation of observations .",
    "co - existing cool and hot regions in an inhomogeneous and dynamic atmosphere offer the ultimate solution for the diagnostic dilemma with apparently contradicting temperatures derived from co on the one and uv - based diagnostics on the other hand .",
    "these different observational aspects can now be explained together with one single model , like the one presented here , whereas conventional ( semi)-empirical 1d models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. , vernazza  1981 ) ) can at best account for selected aspects of the atmosphere .",
    "the full potential of detailed 3d models gets obvious when addressing the small - scale spatial pattern .",
    "for instance , the models imply that the spatial resolution of trace at 160 nm is not sufficient to resolve the small - scale pattern of the middle to upper photosphere . that has consequences for the conclusions derived for atmospheric dynamics and heating ( * ? ? ? * ( fossum & carlsson 2005 ) ) .",
    "a comprehensive numerical model is also helpful for defining constraints on diagnostics ( in combination used as a kind of tomography ) that are required for the desired empirical determination of the thermal structure of the atmosphere .",
    "for instance , the continua at ( sub-)millimetre wavelengths as chromospheric diagnostics seem to be a promising alternative to the complicated inner regions of the caii resonance lines .",
