    "after the discovery of co band head emission in the bn object by scoville et al .",
    "( @xcite ) a large number of further detections in other young stellar objects ( yso ) followed ( see e.g. geballe & persson @xcite ; carr @xcite ; chandler et al .",
    "@xcite ; greene & lada @xcite ; najita et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "several scenarios were discussed to explain the origin of the hot ( 25005000 k ) and dense ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) co component ( for some examples see calvet et al .",
    "@xcite ; martin @xcite ) , but the most likely location is a neutral disk or wind ( carr @xcite ; chandler , carlstrom , & scoville @xcite ) .",
    "the disk model is especially supported by high resolution spectroscopic observations of the co @xmath2 band head .",
    "the shape of this band head shows for several yso the kinematic signature of keplerian rotation ( carr et al .",
    "@xcite ; carr @xcite ; najita et al .",
    "@xcite ) and is a powerful tracer for the existence of a circumstellar disk around young stellar objects .",
    "also the peculiar b[e]-star shows the first overtone co bands in emission .",
    "these bands were observed first by geballe & persson ( @xcite ) with a velocity resolution of about 460km / s .",
    "mwc349 is a binary system consisting of the main component mwc349a , classified as a b[e]-star , and the b0 iii star companion , mwc349b , localized @xmath7 west of mwc349a .",
    "we are only interested in the main component , in the following refered to as mwc349 .",
    "its evolutionary state is still unclear .",
    "it shows some characteristics of a pre - main sequence b[e]-type star as well as characteristics of a b[e ] supergiant ( e.g. lamers et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    cohen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) determined its distance ( 1.2kpc ) , bolometric luminosity ( @xmath8l@xmath9 ) and the visual extinction towards it ( @xmath10mag of which 2mag might be circumstellar ) .",
    "the existence of a bulge of circumstellar dust around mwc349 has been known since long ago ( e.g. geisel @xcite ) .",
    "the proposition that mwc349 also has a disk was supported by observations of double - peaked emission lines ( hamann & simon @xcite , @xcite ) and by ir speckle interferometry ( leinert @xcite ; mariotti et al .",
    "@xcite ) which revealed a disk - like structure of the dust emission in the east - west direction , seen nearly edge on .",
    "an accumulation of neutral gas and dust in the equatorial plane of the star is also expected to be responsible for the bipolar structure of the optically thick wind zone seen in the vla - map of white & becker ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass loss rate found for a 50km / s wind velocity is @xmath11m@xmath9yr@xmath12 ( cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another indicator for the circumstellar disk are the strong hydrogen recombination maser lines in the mm and submm range which also show the characteristic double - peaked profiles ( e.g. martn - pintado et al .",
    "recombination lines at different wavelengths sample different regions . with decreasing quantum number @xmath13 , i.e. increasing frequency",
    ", one sees ionized gas closer to the star .",
    "the fact that the rotational velocity of recombination lines with decreasing @xmath13 displays a systematical increase led to the assumption that the double - peaked maser emission comes from the ionized atmosphere of a keplerian rotating disk around a 2530m@xmath9 star ( thum , martn - pintado & bachiller @xcite ; thum et al .",
    "@xcite ) whose free - free and free - bound emission was modelled by kraus et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , rodrguez & bastian ( @xcite ) determined the inclination angle of the disk towards the line of sight to @xmath14 .    in this paper , we present new low resolution observations of the total first overtone co band emission as well as high resolution observations of the @xmath2 and @xmath15 band heads .",
    "we discuss the probable location of the hot co gas by modeling the emission for several scenarios .",
    "in 1997 we observed mwc349 with the ukirt telescope in the nir range ( @xmath16 m ) with a spectral resolution of @xmath17km / s ( fig.[observ]a ) .",
    "the spectrum contains several prominent hydrogen and helium recombination lines as well as the first overtone co bands , all of them in emission .",
    ".identified lines in the nir spectrum of mwc349 ( figs . a and b ) . [ cols=\">,>,>,^,^ \" , ]     [ seg_param ]    but there is still another alternative with @xmath18@xmath4 , which we discuss now .",
    "if the co band emission arises in the disk , it must come from inside the evaporation radius of the dust , @xmath19 , because of its high temperature of @xmath20k . according to the kraus et al .",
    "model of the dust disk , the distance is then smaller than 2.88au according to a rotational velocity greater than 90km / s .",
    "let us assume @xmath21km / s . to avoid the problems with the line profile in case of such a high @xmath22 , as discussed in subsection [ disk ] and demonstrated in figure [ rot ] , we propose a configuration as depicted in figure [ skizze4 ] .",
    "the disk has a bulge and because of its small inclination angle @xmath23 , this bulge blocks the light from the inner edge of the disk on the near side to the observer .",
    "we therefore receive emission only from sector 1 in figure [ skizze4 ] where the _ radial _ velocity is low . in figure [ segment ]",
    "we show computations of the flux received from sector 1 for different opening angles @xmath24 .",
    "the ranges of radial velocities in the sectors are summarized in table [ seg_param ] .",
    "we present low and high resolution spectra in the near infrared of the b[e]-star mwc349 .",
    "the wavelength interval 2.2852.342@xmath0 m contains mainly emission of the first overtone bands of the co molecule as well as the pfund series of atomic hydrogen . from modeling the pfund lines under the assumption that they are optically thin , we find that they come from the inner part of the region around mwc349 and are in lte .",
    "the hydrogen line profiles are approximately gaussian and their width indicates a wind velocity of @xmath25km / s .    the co molecules are at a temperature of 35004000k , the population of the vibrational levels is close to lte .",
    "the width of the @xmath2 band head indicates a velocity broadening of the order of 5060km / s , depending on the broadening mechanism , wind or rotation .",
    "the location of the hot co gas producing the band emission could not be clarified , but we were able to propose several scenarios .    because the co as well as the pfund lines can be fitted with a gaussian velocity component of @xmath26km / s , the first possibility is that the co bands arise in the windy transition layer between the disk and the hii region , presumably in dense clumps ( see fig.13 ) .",
    "the band head has in this case an optical depth of order unity ( @xmath27@xmath4 ) .",
    "alternatively , the co might form in a thin layer above the dust disk at radii between 6.5 and 15au . in this scenario ,",
    "the co emission is optically very thin ( @xmath28@xmath4 ; @xmath29 ) , and the gas is thermally decoupled from the dust . as we could only produce fits of mediocre quality ( see fig.15 ) , due to the characteristic line profiles under keplerian rotation ( see figure [ rot ] ) , this is not our favorite configuration .",
    "finally , we suggest that the co bands come from the inner edge of the circumstellar disk .",
    "because of the required high temperature and column density , the co gas must be located inside the evaporation radius of the dust , i.e.  at distances less than @xmath30au from the star .",
    "although this would imply a high rotational velocity component which would usually lead to a characteristic shoulder in the band profile , which is not observed , the disk may well have a bulge , as depicted in figure [ skizze4 ] .",
    "this bulge absorbs the co emission from the near part of the rotating inner disk edge , so that the observer sees only a sector on the far side where the radial velocities are all smaller than @xmath31km / s .",
    "with such a geometrical configuration , a satisfactory fit is also possible ( see figure [ segment ] ) .",
