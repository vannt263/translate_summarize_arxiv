    "the coupling with the local slope of the surface field @xmath48 can be theoretically derived , leading to    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes the gradients along the normal and tangential direction to the trajectory .",
    "the tangential gradient of the field ( equation [ gradientchampcirculaire](a ) ) becomes independent of the memory @xmath13 in the long memory limits .",

    "guided by this idea , it becomes natural to decompose the field for any path into two parts @xmath54 and dissociate the propulsive contribution @xmath55 from the coherent structure @xmath56 .",
    "the short time effect , being mainly propulsive , admits mainly a tangential component and also imposes @xmath57 as a corollary , the propulsion being a short term action , we define the long term evolution of the field so that it does not contribute anymore to the propulsion , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath58 these two hypotheses impose two constraints which should have consequences on the description of the field .",
    "the frenet decomposition of the surface wave ( equation  [ decompositionchampsemilocal ] ) prescribes @xmath59 seeking in equation  [ identificationterm ] , the terms having a zero tangential derivative ( @xmath60 ) yields @xmath61 .",

    "but is it still valid as we get into longer memory regime ?",
    "section  [ intermediate ] deals with the intermediate time scale dynamics and will investigate how this physical hypothesis stands as we go onto a more complex trajectory .",
    "the income of energy to the drop mediated by @xmath55 increases its horizontal momentum .",
    "nevertheless , as the friction starts acting , the drop loses a part of energy and a dynamical exchange of its energy between the surface field and the drop occurs .",
    "this process defines a steady velocity @xmath65 at which the energy propelling the particle balances its frictional loss of energy . in the regime parameter of interest , this equilibrium speed is a constant of the motion . in the phase space of the dynamics , this constraint defines a manifold in the neighbourhood of which it is convenient to express the dynamics .",
    "this constraint on speed contains some of the major non hamiltonian features of the dynamics in the short memory regime as shown in @xcite .",
    "experiments and path - memory simulations of the dynamics in a harmonic potential @xcite showed that for a given drop , the mean velocity is a constant of the motion and the corresponding fluctuations remain small ( typically@xmath66 ) . in the tangential direction , the combined effect of friction and propulsion from the surface @xmath67 can be expressed as @xmath68 let us mention that only the short term field @xmath55 contributes in the tangential direction as @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath67 is tangential to the trajectory _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath70 .",
    "the amplitude of the propulsion @xmath71 must provide @xmath65 as fixed point and also is only a function of the amplitude of the speed _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 . additionally @xmath73 must be odd in @xmath74 as a complete reverse of the instantaneous of the motion should not break any symmetry in the propulsion , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath75 .",

    "equation  [ selpropulsionterm ] known as a rayleigh - type friction @xcite can be understood from a dynamical point of view : if @xmath74 the speed of the particle decreases below @xmath65 , the density of secondary sources left behind the particle increases the efficiency of the surface field propulsion . on the contrary , if @xmath74 increases above its set point @xmath65 , the density of secondary sources decreases , and the propulsion loses some of its efficiency .",
    "this asymptotic expansion of the propulsion is similar to the propulsion model of a. boudaoud _",

    "an extension of this model considering the fluctuations in speed has been recently developed by bush _",
    "et al._@xcite and shows the importance of these higher order terms in recovering effective mass effects .",
    "the propulsion being expressed in this simple manner , how does the rest of the surface field contribute to the emergence of the intermediate time scale dynamics and of the associated pivotal wave structure ?",
    "we study in this part , the construction of the semi - local wave structures arising at intermediate time scale .",
    "we apply this approach to the lemniscate attractor in the case of a ( 2d ) harmonic potential .",
    "first , we propose a qualitative approach .",
    "second we use the time scale decomposition of the field decomposition ( equation  [ timescaledecompositionofthefield ] ) suggested in section  [ intro2 ] to rationalize the intermediate time scale dynamics .",

    "we also indicate ( in red points ) the location of the instantaneous centre of curvature . as shown in @xcite , the elementary lemniscate path exits under other forms , with an azimuthal drift ( typically smaller than @xmath79 per orbital period ) or by intermittency in a chaotic regime . in all cases",
    "however and as shown in figure [ pivotfig](b ) , when the particle turns back , its speed is minimal and its average centre of curvature concentrates in the neighbourhood of the pivotal point , noted @xmath80 . in figure [ pivotfig]e",
    ", we overdraw in black curve the part of the path contributing effectively to the pivotal surface structure ( typically the @xmath13 last secondary sources )",
    ". then , we plot in the associated figure [ pivotfig]c ( in blue line ) a slice of the normalized surface field along the @xmath81-axis , and in dashed line a bessel function of order zero centred at the pivotal point @xmath80 and of negative and normalized amplitude .",
    "the field generated by this elementary pivotal motion is a pivotal field and is well fitted by a bessel function of order @xmath82 , centred in @xmath80 which actually defines @xmath80 .",
    "let us note that the emergence of this structure does not require a large number of secondary sources .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs for the trefoil attractor @xmath83 as indicated in the coupled figures [ pivotfig](d ) and ( f ) . + locally the turn back generates a surface field @xmath84 : the semi local symmetry of the surface field is a signature of the semi local circular symmetry of the path .",
    "qualitatively , the effect of this process is the emergence of a preferred radius of curvature .",
    "we now derive theoretically how such structures arise .",
    "the short time scale provides information in the tangential direction and it has been shown in the paragraph [ short ] that the propulsion is mediated by short time field @xmath55 .",
    "the rest of field @xmath56 , revealed as the memory increases , is mainly involved in the normal mechanical balance .",
    "we now investigate its role in the emergence of the intermediate time scale dynamics and in the construction of the pivotal wave structure .",

    "note that neglecting @xmath97 is equivalent to the hypothesis ( b ) .",
    "this hypothesis relies on the symmetry of the paths we intend to describe : at an intermediate time scale dynamics , the trajectory of the walker is made of a succession of loops .",
    "each loop promote a dominant local symmetry .",
    "also the separation of the time scales in the dynamics enables the modelling of the dynamics by a set of equations    @xmath98    equations [ equationnormalgeneral](a ) and [ equationnormalgeneral](b ) are kinematic and are consequently always valid .",
    "equation [ equationnormalgeneral](c ) is a differential equation in @xmath95 and simply corresponds to a derivation of its integral form ( equation [ decompositionchampsemilocal ] ) .",
    "it means that the mode @xmath82 of the frenet - adapted wave basis evolves in time owing to two distinct contributions : it relaxes over a memory time and the mode is maintained by the coupling with the drop impacts .",
    "equation [ equationnormalgeneral](c ) can be taken as a definition of @xmath95 and thus does have be checked .",
    "equation [ equationnormalgeneral](d ) is the momentum balance in the tangential direction and is a direct consequence of the expansion of the dynamics in the neighbourhood of the manifold @xmath99 .",
    "equation [ equationnormalgeneral](e ) arises from the normal mechanical balance and differs from the others as no time - derivative is involved .",
    "this implicit equation in @xmath41 actually defines the manifold on which the dynamics evolves .",
    "+ we apply this approach in the case of a ( 2d ) harmonic potential @xmath100 of eigenpulsation @xmath101 which leads to @xmath102 also , the complexity of the dynamics has been reduced to a five dimensional representation @xmath103 .",

    "ii ) the simplicity of equation  [ equationnormal](e ) actually relies on hypothesis ( a ) ( eq .",
    "[ hypothesea ] ) .",
    "it is natural to retain only the dominant field symmetry corresponding to a single pivotal motion but we have to evaluate _ a posteriori _ the relevance of such an hypothesis .",

    "the normal balance is well captured by the equation  [ equationnormal](e ) ( blue time intervals of fig .  [ verifsimu]a ) and the neglected terms @xmath104 are well negligible .",
    "this justifies hypothesis ( a ) ( see equation  [ hypothesea ] ) .",
    "as expected , we also note that the frenet basis decomposition is not convenient as the walker moves in a quasi straight line motion ( red time intervals of figure  [ verifsimu](a ) ) .",
    "figure  [ verifsimu](b ) shows that the tangential balance is also well captured by the equation  [ equationnormal](d ) .",
    "this paragraph also justifies the physical distinction between a short time field @xmath55 mainly involved in the propulsion , and a long time field @xmath56 mainly involved in the normal balance .",
    "it explains the relevance of the decoupling of the effects of the two distinct time scales as it can capture the main features of the dynamics .",
