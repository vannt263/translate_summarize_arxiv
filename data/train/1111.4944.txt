    "the description of the masses and the interaction of low - lying hadron resonances is a central subject of high - energy physics @xcite . to this end , a lot of effort has been put in the development of quantum field theoretical effective hadronic lagrangians : chiral perturbation theory @xcite , its extension with vector mesons @xcite , and linear @xmath0-model(s ) @xcite represent the most outstanding examples .    in this work we concentrate on the theoretical advances of the latter class of hadronic theories :",
    "namely , we focus on a linear @xmath0-model with ( axial-)vector mesons , which aims to describe ( almost all ) hadrons up to 1.7 gev , both in the vacuum and at nonzero temperature and density .",
    "although the linear @xmath0-model with scalar and pseudoscalar mesons has been extensively studied , its generalization with ( axial-)vector mesons was up to now not systematically investigated .",
    "preliminary studies in this direction have been performed for the case @xmath1 only in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath2 is the number of quark flavors . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite a different theoretical principle based on the so - called local realization of chirally symmetry was employed , and in ref .",
    "@xcite only ` half ' of the fields was taken into account ( the scalar isotriplet @xmath3 meson and the pseudoscalar meson @xmath4 were neglected ) .",
    "the construction of the lagrangian of the here considered linear @xmath0 model follows two basic requirements stemming from the underlying qcd theory @xcite : ( i ) global chiral symmetry @xmath5 ( ii ) dilatation invariance , with the exception of terms stemming from the gauge sector ( scale - anomaly and @xmath6 anomaly , in accord with qcd ) and of terms which describe the non - zero values of the quark masses ( explicit breaking of the dilatation symmetry ) .",
    "all other terms are thus described by dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "the assignment of the fields of the model with the resonances listed in the pdg @xcite is straightforward for the multiplets @xmath7 @xmath8 , and @xmath9 as usual , the scalar meson multiplet @xmath10 is problematic : the present @xmath0-model shows indeed results which are at odd with previous @xmath0-model studies .",
    "namely , the preferred scenario is realized for scalar mesons between @xmath11-@xmath12 gev .",
    "this result is a consequence of the inclusion of ( axial-)vector degrees of freedom , which generate peculiar interference effects in the decay amplitudes .",
    "more in general , the role of the ( axial-)vector states is relevant in both the meson and baryon sectors for a proper description of the phenomenology .    some of the resonances of the multiplet @xmath13 were interpreted in ref . @xcite as dynamically generated states .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , unitarization procedures can regenerate preformed quark - antiquark states which were formally integrated out in order to obtain the low - energy effective lagrangians of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , the interpretation of the states @xmath13 as a quark - antiquark multiplet is , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , upheld .",
    "the present proceeding paper is organized as follows : in sec . 2 and 3 we review the mesonic and baryonic sectors respectively , and in sec .",
    "4 we present our conclusions and outlooks .",
    "the basic ingredients of the linear @xmath0-model in the meson sector are the glueball / dilaton field @xmath14 , the ( pseudo)scalar multiplet @xmath15 and the left - handed and right - handed vectorial multiplets @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( the matrices @xmath18 are the generators of the group @xmath19 ) .",
    "the mesonic lagrangian @xmath20 which fulfills the criteria of ( i ) global chiral symmetry and ( ii ) dilatation invariance takes the following form for a generic number of flavors @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath21   -\\lambda_{1}(\\mathrm{tr}[\\phi^{\\dag}\\phi])^{2}+\\nonumber\\\\ + &   c(\\det\\phi^{\\dag}-\\det\\phi)^{2}\\text { } + \\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{\\varepsilon } ( \\phi^{\\dag}+\\phi)]-\\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{tr}[(l^{\\mu\\nu})^{2}+(r^{\\mu\\nu})^{2}]\\nonumber\\\\ &   + \\frac{b}{2}g^{2}\\mathrm{tr}[(l^{\\mu})^{2}+(r^{\\mu})^{2}]+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr}[\\hat{\\delta}(l^{\\mu})^{2}+(r^{\\mu})^{2}]-2ig_{2}\\left ( \\mathrm{tr}[l_{\\mu\\nu}[l^{\\mu},l^{\\nu}]]+\\mathrm{tr}[r_{\\mu\\nu}[r^{\\mu},r^{\\nu}]]\\right )   \\nonumber\\\\ &   + h_{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\left [   \\phi^{\\dag}l_{\\mu}l^{\\mu}\\phi+\\phi r_{\\mu}r^{\\mu } \\phi\\right ]   + 2h_{3}\\mathrm{tr}\\left [   \\phi r_{\\mu}\\phi^{\\dag}l^{\\mu}\\right ] \\text { } + ... \\text{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and dots represent further terms which are either large-@xmath23 suppressed or unimportant in the evaluation of decays and ( on - shell ) scattering lengths .",
    "following comments are in order :    \\(i ) besides the dilaton field @xmath14 , the mesonic fields of the model are quark - antiquark fields .",
    "this can be easily seen by studying the so - called large-@xmath23 limit @xcite : the masses are @xmath23-independent and the widths scale as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the dilaton potential reads @xmath25 @xmath26   $ ] @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 has dimension energy and sets the energy scale of the theory .",
    "\\(iii ) the @xmath6 anomaly term is parametrized by the parameter @xmath28 , which has dimension [ energy]@xmath29 .",
    "\\(iv ) in the ( pseudo)scalar sector the explicit symmetry breaking of both chiral and dilatation symmetries is encoded in the matrix @xmath30 , where the entries are the bare quark masses . similarly , in the ( axial-)vector sector the analogous diagonal matrix @xmath31 has been introduced .",
    "\\(v ) chiral symmetry breaking takes place when the parameter @xmath32 is negative .",
    "in fact , upon the condensation of the field @xmath33 the ` wrong ' mesonic mass sign is realized for @xmath34 .",
    "\\(vi ) the calculations are performed at tree - level .",
    "the inclusion of loops is a task for the future , but only slight changes are expected @xcite . here",
    "we mostly concentrate on decay widths ; it is in this respect interesting to notice that the latter do not correspond to a exponential law as function of time because large variations take place for hadrons @xcite .    once the shifts of the scalar fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where the first term is a diagonal matrix with the quark - antiquark condensates , and necessary redefinitions of the pseudoscalar and axial - vector fields have been performed , the explicit calculations of physical processes are lengthy but straightforward .",
    "the case @xmath1 with frozen glueball @xmath37 has been studied in ref .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of ( axial-)vector mesons has a strong influence on the overall phenomenology .",
    "for instance , the width of the scalar meson @xmath0 ( the chiral partner of the pion ) decreases substantially w.r.t . the case without ( axial-)vector mesons",
    ": for this reason , the identification of this field with the resonance @xmath38 is not favoured , because the theoretically evaluated width is smaller than @xmath39  mev , while the experimental one is larger than @xmath40 mev . on the contrary",
    ", the identification of the @xmath0 field with the resonance @xmath41 turns out to be in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the description of the ( axial-)vector resonances is also in agreement with the experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the glueball with a bare mass of about @xmath42 gev , in agreement with the lattice calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , has been studied for the first time in a chiral model with ( axial-)vector mesons .",
    "( for a compilation of other approaches see refs . @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the state @xmath43 results as the predominantly ( @xmath44 ) glueball state , and the rest of the phenomenology is only slightly affected w.r.t . the previous case , in which @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , also the gluon condensate can be evaluated and turns out to be in agreement with lattice results .",
    "future works in the meson sector consist in the study of the cases @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "preliminary results of the former case were already presented in conference proceedings @xcite and a systematic study will be concluded soon .",
    "interestingly , when increasing @xmath2 of one unit , only two additional parameters , both related to the included bare quark mass , are necessary .",
    "thus , enlarging the model is straightforward ( although it implies lengthy calculations ) and allows for more stringent checks of the model .    finally , being the scalar states above @xmath11 gev , a natural question is the assignment of the existing resonances below @xmath11 gev . according to the jaffe s interpretation @xcite",
    "these resonances can be interpreted as a scalar nonet of tetraquark states , see refs . @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "the coupling of tetraquark fields to the chiral model is possible by following the prescription of ref .",
    "the study of this scenario and the arising mixing patterns represents an outlook .",
    "interestingly , in the simplified case @xmath1 there is only one scalar tetraquark field @xmath48 , which can be identified with the resonance @xmath38 ; its coupling to the chiral model has been discussed also at nonzero @xmath49 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that it can substantially influence the properties of the chiral phase transition .",
    "this study shows that the correct interpretation of scalar resonances is mandatory not only for a correct understanding of spectroscopy in vacuum , but also toward a proper description of hadrons at nonzero temperature .",
    "the inclusion of the nucleons and their chiral partner into the model was performed in ref .",
    "the aim is the description of vacuum phenomenology ( such as pion - nucleon scattering lengths and decays ) , the origin of the nucleon mass , the properties of nuclear matter , and the chiral phase transition at nonzero density .    in the so - called mirror assignments @xcite",
    "one starts with two baryonic fields @xmath50 and @xmath51 transforming under chiral transformation as @xmath52 while @xmath50 transforms as usual , @xmath51 transforms in a ` mirror way ' . due to this characteristic it is possible to write down the following lagrangian in the baryonic sector for @xmath1 : @xmath53 whereas @xmath54 with @xmath55 and the chirally invariant mass term @xmath56 reads @xmath57 the chirally invariant fields @xmath48 and @xmath14 represent the scalar tetraquark and glueball , respectively .",
    "( note , the term @xmath56 would not be possible if the field @xmath51 would transform as @xmath50 . )",
    "all the introduced coupling constants are dimensionless , as required by the requirement of dilatation invariance .    upon generation of the tetraquark and gluon condensates @xmath58 and @xmath59 , a nonvanishing chiral mass emerges@xmath60 which represents the mass contribution to the nucleon which does _ not _ stem from the chiral ( quark - antiquark ) condensate @xmath61 .",
    "the nucleon and its partner arise upon diagonalization of @xmath50 and @xmath62 : @xmath63{c}n\\\\ n^{\\ast}\\end{array } \\right )   = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\cosh\\delta}}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}e^{\\delta/2 } & \\gamma_{5}e^{-\\delta/2}\\\\ \\gamma_{5}e^{-\\delta/2 } & -e^{\\delta/2}\\end{array } \\right )   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}\\psi_{1}\\\\ \\psi_{2}\\end{array } \\right )   \\text { , } \\cosh\\delta=\\frac{m_{n}+m_{n^{\\ast}}}{2m_{0}}\\text { , } \\label{mix}\\ ] ] whereas the masses of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are a combination of @xmath66 and the chiral condensate @xmath67 : @xmath68    the study of the vacuum s properties of this model has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . upon a fitting",
    "to known experimental and lattice values , the value of @xmath66 turns out to be non - negligible : @xmath69 mev . as a further step",
    "the pion - nucleon scattering lengths can be calculated and are in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "( in particular , one has @xmath70 mev@xmath71 , which should be compared with @xmath72 mev@xmath71 .",
    "the isospin - even scattering length @xmath73 depends on the scalar meson sector and is therefore more subtle , see details in ref .",
    "it is in this respect important to stress that ( i ) ( axial-)vector mesons play a non - negligible role for the pion - nucleon scattering lengths and ( ii ) the use of the naive assignment , which is equivalent to the case without the chiral partner of the nucleon , delivers unacceptable result for the scattering lengths .",
    "the extension to nonzero density has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the parameter @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ m0 ] ) has been set to zero .",
    "it is thus assumed that the tetraquark state dominates : an important outcome of eq .",
    "( [ m0 ] ) is the generation of a tetraquark - exchange term for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , which intuitively corresponds to the exchange of diquarks between nucleons .",
    "the corresponding resonance is the lightest scalar state @xmath38 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite it is possible to describe nuclear matter saturation for the very same value of @xmath66 obtained in the vacuum .",
    "moreover , the nuclear matter compressibility turns out to be in agreement with the experimental value . for",
    "increasing density a first order chiral phase transition takes place at @xmath75 , at which both quark - antiquark and tetraquark condensates drop to ( almost ) zero .",
    "interestingly , in the proposed approach the binding of nuclear energy is possible in virtue of the existence of a light tetraquark field .",
    "an amusing consequence is that nuclear matter seems to be a peculiarity of our @xmath76 world , which does not hold when increasing @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in this work recent results obtained with a linear @xmath0-model with ( axial-)vector mesons have been presented . the inclusion of ( axial-)vector degrees of freedom is a necessary step toward a proper description of both vacuum and medium properties of hadrons .",
    "various outlooks of the described approach are planned : ( i ) the extension to @xmath46 is an ongoing project with preliminary results presented in ref .",
    "only two additional parameters w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath1 case are needed .",
    "( ii ) inclusion of a light tetraquark nonet and evaluation of mixing with the quark - antiquark states .",
    "( iii ) the extension to @xmath46 allows to included charmed mesons into the chiral model ( for the first time with ( axial-)vector states ) .",
    "also in this case only two additional parameters w.r.t . the case @xmath46 are necessary .",
    "( iv ) the pseudoscalar glueball with a lattice predicted mass @xcite of about @xmath77 gev can be easily incorporated into the model .",
    "both outlooks ( iii ) and ( iv ) are interesting in view of the planned panda experiment @xcite at the fair facility at gsi / darmstadt .",
    "( v ) evaluation of weak decays of the @xmath78-lepton into hadrons .",
    "( vi ) calculation of nucleon - nucleon scattering and related dilepton production , e.g. ref .",
    "( vii ) extension of the study at nonzero @xmath49 .",
    "preliminary works were performed with simplified versions of the models in refs .",
    "@xcite , but a systematic study needs to be performed .",
    "care is needed in view of the discussion presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that a modification of purely hadronic models is necessary in order to be in agreement with basic properties of the large-@xmath23 limit .",
    "( viii ) further studies of properties at nonzero density , with special attention to the quarkyonic phase and to non - homogeneous condensates @xcite , are planned . the outlooks ( vii ) and ( viii )",
