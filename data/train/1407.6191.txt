    "in recent times the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) has generated a lots of excitement in the field of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , as it allows thermodynamic concepts to be applied to also small systems , as well as to systems that are arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "the ft expresses universal properties of the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath0 for functional @xmath1 $ ] , like work , heat , power flux or entropy production , evaluated along the fluctuating trajectories @xmath2 taken from ensembles with well - specified initial distributions .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies to elucidate different aspects of ft .",
    "we refer to the recent review @xcite which contains an extensive list of references both from the theoretical and the experimental aspects .",
    "the ft can be broadly classified into two groups , namely , the transient ft ( tft ) and the steady state ft ( ssft ) .",
    "the tft pioneered by evans and searles @xcite applies to relaxation towards a steady state but at finite time . in this work",
    ", they obtain the symmetries of the pdf of ` entropy production ' at the transient . on the other hand",
    "the ssft quantifies the ` entropy production ' @xmath3 in a time duration @xmath4 , in the non equilibrium steady state as , @xmath5 this was first found by evans _",
    "_ in simulations of two - dimensional sheared fluids  @xcite and then proven by gallavotti and cohen  @xcite using assumptions about chaotic dynamics .",
    "kurchan @xcite and lebowitz and spohn @xcite have established this theorem for stochastic diffusive dynamics . in all these early works ,",
    "the entropy production has been identified with the entropy production in the medium .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the ssft holds even for finite times in the steady state if one incorporates the entropy production of the system . though the ft for entropy production has been found to be robust under rather general conditions",
    ", the question is whether this is generic for other observables like work , dissipated heat etc .",
    "indeed , there are only a handful of examples where the ssft for work , heat @xcite has been investigated .",
    "it has been observed that the validation of ssft for these observables is not universal , e.g. in @xcite , the authors have found the ` work ' to satisfy ssft while the ` heat ' does not , in general .",
    "thus , one hopes to gain insights by studying exactly solvable cases .",
    "as the ft deals only with the symmetry properties of the pdf , the explicit form of the pdf is often not required to realize the validity of the relation .",
    "however , it is by itself , an interesting endeavor to compute the pdf of the time integrated quantities like work , heat , etc . , and there are not many such examples where it can be done analytically .",
    "the long time behavior of the pdf is intimately related to the so - called large deviation function ( ldf )  @xcite , and in the recent years , a lot of efforts have been devoted to the computation of ldfs in non - trivial models  @xcite . the symmetry relation can be expressed in terms of a symmetry relation satisfied by the corresponding ldf .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an underdamped brownian particle driven by a correlated random external field .",
    "we study the pdf of the work done by the external random field in a given duration .",
    "the exact ldf associated with the pdf is found to have a non - trivial form .",
    "the ssft is found to be hold in a restrictive parameter space of the model , confirming the fact that the ft for work , heat is non generic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we define the model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mgf ] we compute the moment generating function ( mgf ) of work @xmath6 performed in a given time @xmath4 in steady state , which has the form @xmath7 . in sec .",

    "the velocity @xmath10 of the particle evolves according to the underdamped langevin equation , given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the friction coefficient .",
    "the viscous relaxation time scale for the particle is @xmath13 .",
    "the thermal noise @xmath14 is taken to be a gaussian white noise with mean zero and correlation@xmath15 , where diffusion constant @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "this system reaches a steady state and in the steady state the external force has zero mean and covariance @xmath22 .",
    "the heat current flowing from the bath to the particle is the force exerted by the bath times the velocity of the particle @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a given time @xmath4 , the total amount of heat flow ( in the unit of @xmath23 ) is given by , @xmath24 on the other hand , the change in the internal energy of the particle in this finite interval @xmath4 is given by @xmath25~.   \\label{energy}\\ ] ] then the first law of the thermodynamics ( conservation of energy ) gives @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the work done on the particle by the external force , which is given by @xmath28 this work is a stochastic quantity and our goal is to compute its pdf @xmath29 .",
