    "<S> nuclear magnetic relaxation rate @xmath0 in iron - pnictide superconductors is calculated using the gap function obtained in a microscopic calculation . </S>",
    "<S> based on the obtained results , we discuss the issues such as the rapid decrease of @xmath0 just below the transition temperature and the difference between nodeless and nodal s - wave gap functions . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the effect of coulomb interaction on @xmath0 in the random phase approximation and show its importance in interpreting the experimental results .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    iron pnictides , multi - orbital hubbard model , gap structure , nmr    iron - pnictide superconductors have been one of the central issues in condensed matter physics since its discovery . </S>",
    "<S> many experimental and theoretical works have been carried out to elucidate the symmetry and the structure of the superconducting gap function since the information on the gap structure gives a vital clue to determine the origin of the superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it is recognized that the iron - pnictide superconductors show varieties of the structure of the gap function@xcite , i.e. , nodeless behavior in some systems and nodal behavior in other systems .    </S>",
    "<S> nmr measurement of @xmath1 is useful in determining such detailed structure of the gap function and many experimental results have been published@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we calculate @xmath1 based on some models for iron pnictides and compare the obtained results with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> since many theoretical works exist@xcite , we concentrate on the unresolved issues such as the rapid decrease of @xmath0 just below the transition temperature and the discussion on the difference between nodeless and nodal s - wave gap functions .    for this purpose , we use the five - orbital hubbard model proposed in ref @xcite . since we want to discuss the difference between the nodeless s - wave and nodal s - wave , we use following two models . </S>",
    "<S> one is a simplified model downfolded from the lda calculation on the lafeaso system . here </S>",
    "<S> `` simplify '' means that we neglect the three dimensionality and take hopping integrals only up to the fifth nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> other is a three dimensional model of the lafepo system . </S>",
    "<S> all results shown below are obtained with band filling @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the coupling between the conduction electrons and nuclear spins is diagonal in the orbital basis and using the constant form factor @xmath3 , @xmath1 can be written as @xmath4 note that @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the orbital indices . without coulomb interaction , we have @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the normal ( anomalous ) green s function in the orbital representation . </S>",
    "<S> we also take acount of the coulomb interaction within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , where the enhancement factor @xmath11 is included . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath12 is the matrix form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ chi0 ] ) and @xmath13 is the spin vertex defined as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , 0 ( others ) . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we use @xmath18 ev , @xmath19 ev , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> as is noted above , we describe the coupling between electrons and nuclear spins and the green s function in the orbital basis . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we describe the gap function also in the orbital basis . in this orbital representation , </S>",
    "<S> the gap function becomes matrix form as @xmath22 . limiting the discussion on the s - wave channel , </S>",
    "<S> physically important entries of @xmath22 can be written as @xmath23 note that subscript 2 , 3 and 4 represent @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbital respectively . to determine the parameters in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ d22]-[d24 ] ) , we solve the linearized eliashberg equation with the effective interaction calculated within rpa ( we follow the formalisms in ref  @xcite ) . then , we obtain the gap function with interband sign reversal witch can be parameterized as ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) = ( 0.0075 , -0.038 , -0.0155 , 0.0075 , 0.21 , 0.11 , -0.047 , -0.0054 , 0.045 ) for lafeaso and ( 0.060 , -0.030 , -0.011 , 0.0050 , -0.072 , 0.024 , -0.0044 , -0.022 , -0.017 ) for lafepo . </S>",
    "<S> the important difference between the two results is that @xmath36 has weaker @xmath37 dependence in lafepo and this weak dependence leads to the node when the gap function is written in the band representation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the gap function is nodeless in lafeaso and nodal in lafepo .    for studying the gap function below @xmath38 , we assume the usual temperature dependence , i.e. , we use @xmath39 in this work , @xmath38 is fixed to a large value of 0.02 ev to avoid the numerical difficulty . scaling factor @xmath40 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deltat ] ) is determined to have @xmath41 that is typical for iron - pnictide superconductors with @xmath42 being the largest gap value on the fermi surface .     without coulomb interaction where @xmath43 is the @xmath44 value at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> calculation is done with 192@xmath45192 ( 100@xmath45100@xmath458 ) meshes in the momentum space for lafeaso ( lafepo ) system . </S>",
    "<S> upper ( lower ) panel shows the results without ( with ) coulomb interaction.,width=219 ]    first , we show the results without coulomb interaction in the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in this calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we use the damping factor @xmath46 to discuss the clean limit ( @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the used gap functions have unconventional property ( interband sign reversal ) , the results show that the small coherence peaks appears in both of lafeaso and lafepo system . </S>",
    "<S> ( the coherence peak in lafepo is neglegibly small . ) </S>",
    "<S> inset of the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows that @xmath0 decreases slower in lafepo system that has the nodal gap function compared with lafeaso system as is expected . </S>",
    "<S> actually , @xmath0 in lafepo decreases slower than @xmath49 just below @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we show the results with coulomb interaction treated within rpa in the lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the most important difference between results with and without coulomb interaction is the disappearance of the coherence peaks . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the same damping factor @xmath46 as in the case of without coulomb interaction , i.e. , we assume the same strength of the impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can eliminate the coherence peaks without including the impurity effects . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this disappearance is that coulomb interaction makes the interband contribution to @xmath0 more dominant than the intraband contribution and the dominance of the interband contribution leads to the disappearance of the coherence peak for the gap function with an interband sign reversal@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another important point is that coulomb interaction gives faster decrease of @xmath0 just below @xmath38 as can be seen by comparing the inset of upper and lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> paying attention to the temperature just below @xmath38 , the result for lafeaso system shows more rapid decrease than @xmath50 , which is the experimintally claimed rapid decrease@xcite , and the result for lafepo system shows the decreasing rate close to @xmath49 . note that such details depend on the value of @xmath40 as is the case without coulomb interaction .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the difference of the nodeless and nodal s - wave gap function through calculating @xmath1 using the microscopically determined gap functions . </S>",
    "<S> we have also demonstrated that coulomb interaction can be a possible reason for the non existence of the coherence peaks in the clean limit . </S>",
    "<S> further , we have shown the importance of coulomb interaction in the discussion of the power of @xmath0 just below @xmath38 . </S>"
