    "in 1951 , plya and szego conjectured :    _ of all @xmath0-polygons with the same area , the regular @xmath0-polygon has the smallest first dirichlet eigenvalue , _    referring to the dirichlet eigenvalue of the laplacian .",
    "it is very simple to see that among all rectangles of same area , the one that minimizes the first laplace dirichlet eigenvalue is the square . using steiner symmetrization ,",
    "plya and szego proved the conjecture for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but it is still an open problem for @xmath3 . on the other hand , the well known faber - krahn s inequality ,",
    "affirms that in any dimension , among all domains of same volume , the euclidean ball has the smallest first laplace dirichlet eigenvalue .",
    "the notion of the first dirichlet eigenvalue for linear elliptic operators , has been extended to fully nonlinear ones ( see @xcite ) . indeed , for linear operators , berestycki , nirenberg and varadhan in @xcite use the maximum principle to define the principal eigenvalue .",
    "so , following their idea it is possible to prove that , if @xmath4 denotes the pucci s supremum operator , with ellipticity constants @xmath5 and if @xmath6 is a bounded lipschitz domain , then there exists @xmath7 in @xmath6 such that @xmath8 for @xmath9 for @xmath10 the existence of a negative eigenfunction is similarly proved .",
    "it is hence quite natural , to wonder if the faber - krahn inequality is valid for these `` eigenvalues '' associated to @xmath4 ; precisely , given a ball @xmath11 is it true that @xmath12 here @xmath13 indicates the volume .",
    "faber - krahn inequality is proved in several ways , the most classical one uses steiner symmetrization together with the rayleigh quotient that defines the eigenvalue .",
    "clearly these tools are not at all adapted to this non variational fully nonlinear setting .",
    "another possible proof relies on a more geometrical understanding of the problem ; as it is well - explained in @xcite , a domain @xmath6 is critical for the laplace first eigenvalue functional under fixed volume variation , if and only if the eigenfunction @xmath7 associated to @xmath14 has constant neumann boundary condition i.e. if it is a solution of an overdetermined boundary value problem .",
    "this is proved using hadamard s identity ( we refer to @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "but , by serrin s classical result , the only bounded domains which admit non trivial solutions satisfying overdetermined boundary conditions are balls . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that at least for @xmath15 and @xmath16 close enough , the only bounded domains for which the overdetermined boundary value problem associated to @xmath4 admits a non trivial solution are the balls .",
    "this suggests that ( [ fk ] ) may be true .",
    "unfortunately , it is not known if , for the eigenvalue functional associated to @xmath4 , the critical domains under fixed volume have eigenfunctions with constant normal derivative .    both the faber - krahn inequality and the plya and szego conjecture state that symmetry of the domain decreases the laplace first eigenvalue .",
    "if this is true for the pucci eigenvalue is not known but the scope of this paper is to show that among a family of subsets of @xmath17 of same area , which are in some sense deformations of rectangles , the one that minimizes @xmath18 is the most symmetric one .",
    "this minimal domain will be denoted @xmath19 for @xmath20 and it is , somehow , a deformation of a square .",
    "the result is accomplished by explicitly computing the eigenvalue @xmath21 and the corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "observe that the square is not the good set to consider , since , as it is proved in proposition [ rect ] , the eigenfunction associated to the square is not the product of two functions of one variable .",
    "remarkably , an analogous explicit computation of @xmath22 leads to unbounded sets .",
    "in particular , one can construct a symmetric unbounded set @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "in order to fix notations , we recall that the supremum pucci operator is defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath27 and @xmath28 are fixed constants .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the following observation .",
    "let @xmath31 and let @xmath32 be the principal eigenfunction of @xmath4 in @xmath33 associated with the positive principal eigenvalue @xmath34 , that is @xmath35 u>0 \\quad \\hbox{in }   q\\ , , \\",

    "then , by symmetry and regularity results , @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 smooth , positive , even , and , up to a normalization , satisfying @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath40 and equation ( [ eigen ] ) tested at @xmath41 yields @xmath42 moreover , if for some @xmath43 one has @xmath44 , then from equation ( [ eigen ] ) written for @xmath45 we obtain the contradiction @xmath46 therefore , we have @xmath47 in @xmath48 and , again from equation ( [ eigen ] ) , we deduce that @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 f\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)=0\\ , , \\",

    "we suitably extend the function @xmath65 in order to obtain an eigenfunction for @xmath4 relative to the eigenvalue @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath115 has singularity points at @xmath116 , where an angle of amplitude @xmath117 occurs ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , for @xmath118 , the eigenfunction @xmath119 has the expression @xmath120 showing that @xmath121 vanishes quadratically as @xmath122 .",

    "indeed , by the comparison principle , it immediately follows that @xmath127    the function @xmath128 can be extended in order to obtain a changing sign eigenfunction for @xmath4 in the whole @xmath17 .",

    "conversely , the connected components of the set @xmath133 are unbounded for any @xmath134 . for @xmath135 @xmath136",
    "is connected and unbounded in both @xmath81 and @xmath82 direction , whereas either for @xmath137 or for @xmath138 the connected components of @xmath136 are contained in unbounded respectively horizontal or vertical stripes , see figure 2 .",
    "since @xmath89 is a negative eigenfunction for @xmath4 in each of the connected components of @xmath136 , we can say that for these sets one has @xmath139 .",
    "we finally remark that this construction does not yield a changing sign eigenfunction for a bounded domain , so that we can not calculate eigenvalues different from the principal ones .",
    "let us now enlarge , by deforming the sets @xmath90 , the class of domains for which we can evaluate the positive principal eigenvalue of @xmath4 .",
