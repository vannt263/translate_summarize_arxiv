    "there are many motivations to introduce an extended higgs sector .",
    "examples are , including obsolete ones , fine - tuning in the weak - scale higgs mass @xcite suggesting supersymmetry @xcite , @xmath0-violation @xcite , grand unification @xcite , extended gauge symmetry @xcite , strong @xmath0 problem @xcite , string theory @xcite , vacuum stability @xcite , light fermion mass / weak - scale hierarchy @xcite , fermion flavour structure @xcite , neutrino mass @xcite , dark matter ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , cosmic rays @xcite , baryogenesis @xcite , inflation @xcite , novel collider phenomenology @xcite , as well as anomalies seen in precision ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and accelerator ( see e.g.  @xcite ) experiments . in this article , we entertain the possibility that an intriguing outcome from the lep experiment is in fact pointing to an extended higgs sector , which may be directly inspected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    specifically , we take as our framework the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) of type - i with @xmath7 in the vicinity of the @xmath2-boson mass .",
    "the two main points of this paper are the following .",
    "( 1 ) the charged higgs produced in association with the lightest neutral higgs can be discovered as an excess in the @xmath8 process at the lhc .",
    "moreover , this could happen even at the early stage with @xmath9 in a substantial portion of the parameter space .",
    "( 2 ) with the lightest neutral higgs mass assumed to be @xmath10 , the charged higgs one - loop effect can enhance @xmath11 enough to produce the excess observed at the recent lhc analyses @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is particularly welcome since the @xmath12 production at hadron colliders is generically suppressed due to higgs mixing .",
    "this light charged higgs scenario was previously advocated in  @xcite , whose contents we recap here .",
    "the lep elecroweak working group has performed an analysis of @xmath2 decay branching ratios . in their report",
    ", @xmath13 appears to be higher than @xmath14 and @xmath15 , to the level of 2.8 standard deviations @xcite .",
    "should this difference be real , it would violate the charged current lepton universality , that is predicted by the gauge invariance of the standard model ( sm ) and has been confirmed in many indirect tests .    as a resolution of this puzzle , one of the authors pointed out that a significant portion of the apparent lepton non - universality can be attributed to production of light charged higgs pairs which predominantly decay to the @xmath16 final states @xcite .",
    "one of the most natural ways to realise a @xmath1 that has mass @xmath17 and is thus light enough to be on - shell produced at lep , is to employ the type - i two higgs doublet model ( 2hdmi ) . in this model ,",
    "all the @xmath1fermion couplings are suppressed like @xmath18 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . with the choice of a high enough @xmath5 , this enables @xmath1 to escape from the severe flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) constraints as well as any process that probes the @xmath1fermion interaction such as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    presuming the above lep anomaly to be real",
    ", the following points make this scenario more appealing .",
    "first , invoking a light charge higgs ( discussed also in  @xcite ) is the only proposed solution that does not spoil the other precision lepton universality tests using lepton or meson decays @xcite .",
    "second , the requirement of a light charged higgs plus @xmath22 singles out type - i out of the four types of 2hdms @xcite in which tree - level fcnc is forbidden by a @xmath23 symmetry @xcite .",
    "note that these assumptions already fix many aspects of the model that otherwise offer more than one option , i.e.the yukawa coupling structure , the charged higgs mass , and the viable range of @xmath5 .",
    "these combine to predict a distinct set of collider physics signatures .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider @xmath0-violation in the higgs sector , which can in general occur in a class of 2hdms . in this way",
    ", we can explore higgs mixing patterns which received relatively less attention .",
    "a practical advantage is that one can analyse both the scalar and the pseudo - scalar higgses in a unified manner : switching between the two sectors reduces to tuning the higgs mixing angles , which determine the composition of each neutral mass eigenstate .    within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there are earlier studies of @xmath0-violating higgs phenomenology . in particular , the general @xmath0-violating potential and mass spectrum",
    "can be found in the paper of a.  pilaftsis and c.  wagner @xcite , where the importance of the scalar  pseudo - scalar transitions in higgs phenomenology was emphasised . in the same article ,",
    "the couplings of the charged higgs boson to @xmath0-violating higgs bosons were also discussed .",
    "this article is organised as follows .",
    "we begin by giving an overview of the model in the next section .",
    "section  [ sec : strategy ] is a summary of our search strategy , which leads to the main phenomenological results presented in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "section  [ sec : h1 ] is devoted to the diphoton signal of the lightest neutral higgs .",
    "we deliver our conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in addition , we present : the ghost lagrangian for our setup of 2hdm  in appendix  [ appe : b ] , the relation between our parametrisation and perturbativity in appendix  [ appe : perturbativity ] , and differential cross - sections of our main process in appendix  [ appe : diff ] .",
    "let us give a brief description of the type - i 2hdm  that we have chosen .",
    "the type of a 2hdm  refers to one of the multiple ways to organise the yukawa couplings .",
    "there are four types in which quarks or leptons of each charge couple to only one higgs doublet @xcite , so that neutral higgses are naturally prevented from mediating fcnc @xcite . to this end",
    ", we impose the softly broken @xmath23 symmetry , under which the two higgs doublets @xmath24 transform as @xmath25 whereas the fermion fields remain unchanged .",

    "in addition to the above theoretical requirements , we impose the experimental constraints in  ( [ eq : h2 exclusion ] ) in order to respect the current higgs production limits from the lhc .",
    "this rules out the dark - shadowed strip on the plane .",
    "the bounds on @xmath90 and @xmath91 apply as long as their masses are in the range between 160 and 600  gev .",
    "all these conditions being fulfilled , the question to ask is how much portion of the remaining unshaded region the lhc can cover .    as in the preceding plot , the @xmath2@xmath1@xmath12 coupling largely determines the shape of the @xmath142 contours . as long as one moves along the horizontal axis , @xmath12 is purely @xmath0-even , and therefore its interactions not involving other neutral higgses reduce to those of @xmath70 in the @xmath0-conserving higgs sector .",
    "and @xmath91 do not reduce to those of @xmath71 and @xmath72 due to non - vanishing @xmath103 . ] for instance , the @xmath2@xmath1@xmath12 coupling vanishes at the point @xmath166 , as is the case in figure  [ fig : cpc xs vs angles ] .",
    "this explains why the significance decreases as one approaches this point .",
    "it should be meaningful to interpret the interesting behaviour of @xmath164 around the point @xmath167 , although it belongs to the @xmath168 exclusion strip .",
    "for instance , there might be a way to circumvent the constraint  ( [ eq : h2 exclusion ] ) by taking a different set of parameters . in the neighbourhood of this point ,",
    "one finds a sudden drop of significance even though the @xmath2@xmath1@xmath12 coupling stays nearly maximal .",
    "this is because the @xmath12@xmath137@xmath169 coupling is suppressed there as can be seen in table  [ tab : feynman rules ] . at the origin , @xmath12 becomes fermiophobic , and its dominant decay modes are @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the fermiophobia of @xmath12 generically gives rise to an enhanced @xmath172 without the charged higgs loop contribution . including the @xmath1-loop , the diphoton branching fraction can range from zero up to @xmath173 .",
    "[ we give a related discussion in section  [ sec : h1 ] .",
    "] therefore , the possibility of observing the @xmath142 state in the central low - significance hole via an alternative decay channel of @xmath12 such as the @xmath6 mode , is highly dependent on the other model parameters .",
    "as one departs away from the horizontal axis , @xmath174 , @xmath12 acquires more of the @xmath0-odd component .",
    "this reinforces the production rate of @xmath142 and thereby the significance , since the @xmath2@xmath1@xmath72 coupling is not suppressed for any @xmath100 as can be seen in figure  [ fig : cpc xs vs angles ] .",
    "overall , figures  [ fig : significance cpv ] demonstrate that there is an ample portion of the parameter space in which the lhc has a good chance to discover the @xmath142 production .",
    "obviously , the chance is substantially better in the `` full luminosity '' case , shown in figure  [ overlap_14tev ] . with the exception of the narrow corners around both ends of the horizontal axis and the hole encircling the fermiophobic point , the discovery of @xmath142 through the @xmath4 final state should be possible at any point in the unshaded physically sensible domain defined by  ( [ eq : mass ordering ] ) , ( [ eq : perturbativity ] ) , and ( [ eq : h2 exclusion ] ) . in the same figures",
    "is presented the @xmath12-strahlung process , which could also be detected depending on the mixing angles and the lhc operation condition .",
    "one can understand the shape of the @xmath175 contours by looking at the @xmath12@xmath176@xmath177 coupling in table  [ tab : feynman rules ] . in figure  [ overlap_07tev ] for `` early searches ''",
    ", one finds no common portion of the parameter space with @xmath178 for both processes .",
    "this setup predicts that it is not possible to discover both channels during the first data taking period in the @xmath179 final states .",
    "should this occur , this scenario will have to be modified to survive . in figure  [ overlap_14tev ] , one finds a much broader region in which @xmath12-strahlung could be discovered .",
    "part of this region is shadowed in light grey where the `` full lhc '' could observe both this process and @xmath142 production .",
    "this section is devoted to phenomenology of the lightest neutral higgs .",
    "in particular , we show that the charged higgs loop can exert a marked influence on the @xmath181 decay mode , which is of the utmost importance in the neutral higgs search at the lhc .",
    "we shall consider the following standard higgs production mechanisms : @xmath182 in figures  [ fig : np ] , we plot the cross - sections of these channels at @xmath131 against @xmath5 for each of the two benchmark points .",
    "we have explicitly verified that all these production mechanisms are mostly unaffected in the range of @xmath84 between @xmath183 and @xmath184 and in the neighbourhood of the chosen @xmath7 .",
    "all the production rates are lower than those in the sm .",
    "this is because of the suppression of the couplings in table  [ tab : feynman rules ] . combining production and decay",
    ", we obtain an intriguing result : @xmath12 may have escaped from the past and present searches due to the suppression of both its production and the branching ratios to massive vector boson pairs .",
    "as this scenario generically predicts lower rates into fermion pairs , it could be disfavoured by the recent hint in the @xmath124 mode from the tevatron @xcite if it persists .",
    "obviously , one can ease the reduction of @xmath12 production by taking the higgs mixing pattern to the sm - like limit , @xmath185 . in this case , the charged - neutral higgs associated production will be suppressed as shown in figures  [ fig : significance cpv ] . recall that we are assuming a hierarchical neutral higgs mass spectrum and that all the experimental evidences from the lhc and the tevatron are caused by the lightest of the three neutral higgs particles , which is also supposed to be produced in association with @xmath1 .",
    "relaxing one or more of these hypotheses may lead to a different consequence , although we do not explore this possibility in this paper .    on the other hand ,",
    "branching fractions of the two loop - induced decay modes , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , have possibilities of being enhanced as well as diminished , depending on the input parameters .",
    "if they are increased , the suppressed higgs production can be alleviated .",
    "the decay into the digluon final state arises from the fermion loop , dominated by the top - quark contribution .",
    "although the same type of loop is present also in the sm , its value can be different due to the variation of the @xmath12@xmath188@xmath189 coupling which is determined by the higgs mixing angles as in table  [ tab : feynman rules ] .",
    "in particular , an interesting role is played by the @xmath0-odd component @xmath72 in @xmath12 that could enhance the digluon branching fraction .",
    "its effects are twofold : ( a ) @xmath72 does not couple to a vector boson pair unlike the @xmath0-even higgs @xmath70 ;",
    "( b ) the digluon to difermion partial width ratio of @xmath72 is higher than the corresponding quantity of @xmath70 , i.e.@xmath190 when @xmath191 .",
    "this effect stems from the different lorentz structures of the scalar and the pseudo - scalar couplings with fermions .",
    "the potential enhancement of the @xmath127 decay mode might be of interest at a future lepton collider experiment .",
    "the decay amplitude of @xmath186 has two more components , the @xmath2- and the @xmath1-loops , in addition to the fermion loop . in the sm ,",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath2-loop . like the fermion loop",
    ", the @xmath2-loop can vary as a function of @xmath192 .",
    "one might attempt to increase the diphoton branching fraction by invoking the same mechanism as with the digluon mode .",
    "as @xmath12 becomes pseudo - scalar - like , the fermion loop alone does receive the relative enhancement that is given by  ( [ eq : agg / hgg ] ) with @xmath127 replaced by @xmath6 and each numerator including only the fermion loop .",
    "however , this kills the @xmath2-loop at the same time , which is the dominant contribution in the sm .",
    "therefore , a high @xmath0-odd fraction in @xmath12 is not really helpful in increasing @xmath193 .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that the charged higgs loop can greatly affect the @xmath6 mode when @xmath7 is low @xcite .",
    "in particular , this mechanism can lead to a high enough diphoton rate to be consistent with the excess surrounding the higgs mass of @xmath3 recently observed by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12@xmath111@xmath156 coupling depends on more parameters than the other loops , in particular on @xmath85 , with which one can play in order to engineer the amplitude .",
    "the maximal permitted size of the @xmath1-contribution is mostly controlled by perturbativity and unitarity .",
    "in passing , we remark that change of @xmath85 affects also @xmath194 and therefore the region excluded by  ( [ eq : h2 exclusion ] ) , as we will see in the following plots .",
    "+    to further study this potential variation , we plot the branching fraction of @xmath186 in figures  [ h1-aa ] and [ h1-aa mu=180 ] .",
    "indeed , it can deviate substantially from its sm value depending on the mixing angles .",
    "one finds a valley between the two curves labelled `` a '' on each of the two plots , along which the branching ratio is highly suppressed . across this valley",
    ", the @xmath186 amplitude flips its sign .",
    "as the plots show , the contours are deformed if @xmath85 is changed , since they depend on the @xmath1-loop .",
    "one can also notice that part of the `` d '' contour of a high branching fraction lies on the verge of the perturbativity border , demonstrating that a sizeable @xmath1-loop contribution involves large quartic higgs couplings .",
    "in conjunction with gluon - gluon fusion , this brings us to the cross - section of @xmath195 in figures  [ gg - aa ] and [ gg - aa mu=180 ] . with our crude leading - order approximation",
    ", it is estimated to be about @xmath196 in the sm . in the entire region of panel  [ gg - aa ] ,",
    "the cross - section is smaller than its sm value due to the suppressed @xmath12 production .",
    "nevertheless , one still has the option to change @xmath85 that affects the charged higgs loop .",
    "for instance , the cross - section at @xmath197 is approximately @xmath198 for @xmath199 . at this point ,",
    "the @xmath2- and the @xmath1-loops interfere destructively .",
    "taking @xmath200 instead , one can make the interference constructive by flipping the sign of the @xmath1-contribution .",
    "this pushes the cross - section up above the sm prediction , as displayed in figure  [ gg - aa mu=180 ] . in this plot",
    ", the rate of @xmath195 can be comparable to its sm value even when the mixing angles are fairly removed from the sm - like point , @xmath185 . in combination with figures  [ fig : significance cpv ]",
    ", this exhibits the exciting possibility that the lhc can discover a light charged higgs in the foreseeable future while the recent evidences for higgs decays to @xmath6 are partly due to the charged higgs loop effect .",
    "as one can expect , the charged higgs loop effect weakens for high @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , @xmath193 for @xmath162 is roughly half its value for @xmath163 , when one keeps @xmath197 and @xmath200 .",
    "we demonstrated the superb potential of the lhc to discover a light charged higgs close to the @xmath2-boson mass in the @xmath0-violating 2hdmi . for this purpose",
    ", we exploited the property of the @xmath201 process that its cross - section is stable against variation of @xmath5 , which can be anywhere above the lower bound placed by the most stringent fcnc constraints .",
    "we set the higgs masses to their favoured values , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , and found that the lhc can spot an excess in the @xmath4 events , except in small corners and holes of the parameter space .",
    "we also examined the @xmath12-strahlung channel from @xmath2 , which offers access to the complementary parameter volume to that of @xmath204 .    with regard to @xmath0-violation",
    ", we observed interesting consequences of the scalar  pseudo - scalar mixing .",
    "in particular , @xmath205 can be considerably affected by the composition of @xmath12 .",
    "this result might be relevant to higgs scrutiny at prospective linear collider experiments .",
    "motivated by the recent evidences for higgs production at the lhc , we studied @xmath206 . due to the higgs mixing matrix elements appearing at interaction vertices , the production of @xmath12",
    "is generically suppressed in comparison to the sm .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath1-loop amplitude can make a constructive interference with the standard @xmath2-loop to raise @xmath207 . depending on the parameter choice",
    ", this effect can be significant enough to increase the diphoton production rate from gluon - gluon fusion up to or even above the sm prediction .",
    "alternatively , one can opt to enhance the @xmath12 production itself by letting the higgs mixing pattern approach the sm - like limit . in this case , the other processes with @xmath12 going into the fermion and the massive vector boson pairs are also restored , the price to pay being suppression of the @xmath204 rate .    related to this last point , it may be beneficial to study further possibilities of the light charged higgs scenario in which one makes assumptions different from those underlying the present article .",

    "<S> , the charged - neutral higgs associated production mechanism can cause a significant excess in the @xmath4 events over a vast range of @xmath5 as long as the higgs mixing pattern avoids a few limiting cases . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the low @xmath1 mass , the charged higgs loop can play a striking role in neutral higgs decays into @xmath6 , thereby compensating for a suppressed gluon - gluon fusion rate . </S>",
