    "na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 has captured much attention since its discovery.@xcite this insulator exhibits a large curie weiss temperature ( 650 k ) , yet does not magnetically order down to the lowest measured temperature .",
    "the reason for this is thought to be due to the strongly frustrated nature of the iridium lattice , which forms a hyperkagome network composed of corner sharing triangles ( the hyperkagome lattice being formed by replacing one of the four ir sites in a pyrochlore lattice by a na ion ) .",
    "most models that have been proposed to describe this material assume an isotropic heisenberg model with an effective spin of 1/2 .",
    "this is somewhat of a surprise , given the distorted nature of the lattice and the strong spin - orbit coupling of the iridium ions .",
    "these issues have been discussed in depth in ref .  .",
    "in a previous paper,@xcite we have calculated the exchange constants based on a particular tight binding parametrization of the electronic structure , and found that the resulting spin hamiltonian should be highly anisotropic . in the present paper",
    ", we revisit this issue by considering a more general tight binding parametrization .",
    "we now include the residual crystal field splittings of the ir 5d orbitals due to the octahedral distortions , and find that this corrects a major deficiency of the previous fit , which was an anomalously large value for the @xmath3 hopping . as a result , the more general parametrization leads to the exchange interaction being dominated by the direct exchange between ir ions , and as a consequence , we find an approximately isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "we also find the observed magnitude of the exchange for a reasonable value of the coulomb repulsion .    in section",
    "ii , we provide a microscopic derivation of the exchange hamiltonian , finding a few differences from previously published results . in section iii",
    ", we describe the tight binding parametrizations of the electronic structure , and then in section iv , the resulting exchange constants as a function of the coulomb repulsion . in section",
    "v , we summarize our findings .",
    "in na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , the @xmath4 5d manifold contains one hole per iridium site ( the @xmath5 levels are empty ) , and the oxygen 2p levels are filled .",
    "@xcite this single hole sits in a half - filled doublet level due to spin - orbit coupling , thus motivating an effective s=1/2 exchange model .",
    "this picture , which is supported by our electronic structure calculations , can be exploited to calculate the exchange couplings following ref .  .",
    "in our own derivation , we exploit the work of refs .  , which calculated the exchange couplings for cuprates in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , following the earlier work of koshibae _ et al .",
    "@xcite referred to in ref .  .",
    "we want to derive the exchange couplings generated to fourth order in the hopping of ir holes in the @xmath4 complex .",
    "hopping can be direct between the ir@xmath6 ions or via the p - orbitals of the o@xmath7 ions .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the kramers - degenerate energy levels of the @xmath4 complex with @xmath9 .",
    "these splittings are mostly due to the spin - orbit coupling , which acts to form a lower quartet and an upper doublet , but there is a contribution as well from residual crystal field splittings resulting from the low site symmetry of the iridium ion ( noting that the space group is cubic ) .",
    "@xcite the vacuum state is denoted as @xmath10 where all three levels are fully occupied . the ground state is then generated by linear combinations of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 characterizes the kramers degenerate states , @xmath13 is the site index , and @xmath14 is the creation operator for a hole in the @xmath4 complex .",
    "according to the goodenough - kanamori rules , the strongest contribution to the exchange coupling results from two half - occupied orbitals , so we may focus only on the hopping between the @xmath15 orbitals .",
    "the hamiltonian acting on the ground state is then @xmath16 with on - site hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath14 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators for holes .",
    "indices @xmath13 and @xmath21 describe sites of the ir ion and its nearest - neighbor o ions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the ir @xmath4 and o @xmath20 levels , and @xmath24 are spin indices . the relevant hopping between nearest neighbor ir and o sites is @xmath25 where the spin dependent matrix elements for hopping between ir , and ir and o ions , are @xmath26 note that we use a formulation in terms of holes . but to compare with the results of ref .  , we will insert for the energies of virtual states that of the electrons and not the holes .",
    "the kramers degenerate ground state is split due to virtual hopping processes .",
    "an effective spin hamiltonian @xmath27 can be derived from perturbation theory in @xmath28 .",
    "accounting only for interactions between neighboring spins it is of the general form @xmath29 here @xmath30 indicates a sum over nearest neighbor sites and @xmath31 with spin-@xmath32 operators @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) . in what follows",
    "we want to derive expressions for @xmath35 up to fourth order in the hopping . for this",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath36 so that @xmath37 the energy of the ground state @xmath38 is set to zero .",
    "the lowest order contribution results from direct hopping between ir ions .",
    "there are two contributions resulting from the back and forth hopping of holes on ir sites @xmath13 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "both processes give identical contributions , so we can restrict ourselves to the hopping of a hole at site @xmath13 and multiply its contribution by a factor of two , @xmath40 as mentioned above , we want to compare with the findings of ref .",
    "and therefore we give the energy of the intermediate state with two holes on ir site @xmath39 in terms of the electron s energy .",
    "the latter is @xmath41 and results from the difference in reduced ( increased ) coulomb interaction on the site where a hole is inserted ( removed ) . inserting @xmath42 from eq .",
    "9 we get @xmath43 ) @xmath44 to rewrite this as @xmath45 where the trace is over spin - indices and we neglected a quadratic term @xmath46 which does not contribute to the effective spin hamiltonian in eq",
    "terms involving the factor @xmath32 lead to contributions which also do not contribute to eq .  8 . neglecting these",
    "we find @xmath47 this expression is a factor of two larger than that quoted in ref .  .",
    "we now turn to processes involving intermediate oxygen and states arising from fourth order hopping .",
    "let us start with two observations .",
    "first , only those processes where the hole hops from one ir via the o to a different ir give spin dependent contributions , i.e. processes where the hole hops to o and then returns to the same ir it started from do not contribute to eq .  8 and will be neglected in the following .",
    "second , following ref .",
    ", we notice that there are two qualitatively different processes in which fourth order hopping contributes to eq .",
    "8 . in the ` consecutive channel ' ( cc )",
    "a hole hops from an ir ion to the o , then to the second ir , and finally back to the first ir via the same or a different o. in this channel there are two holes on an ir ion in the intermediate state .",
    "the consecutive channel cc gives an identical contribution as the direct term , however with an effective hopping amplitude @xmath48 . in the second ` simultaneous channel ' ( sc )",
    "a hole hops from one of the ir ions to the o , and then a second hole hops from the second ir to the same or a different o. afterwards the holes return to the ir , i.e. back to the ground state in which one hole occupies each ir . in this second channel , two holes simultaneously occupy o as intermediate states .",
    "[ [ consecutive - channel - cc ] ] consecutive channel cc : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let us first turn to contributions from the consecutive channel ( cc ) and look at a hole at ir site @xmath13 .",
    "hopping of the hole from site @xmath13 to @xmath39 via an o ion at site @xmath21 results in a state @xmath49 with two holes occupying @xmath4 levels of ir at site @xmath39 and no hole on ir site @xmath13 , @xmath50 the ( electron ) energy of the intermediate state after the first hop is a sum of four contributions . removing the hole from the @xmath4 level and inserting the hole in the @xmath51-level of the o ion at site @xmath21",
    "gives @xmath52 for the on - site energies and @xmath53 from the increased and reduced coulomb interaction between the electrons on ir and o ions , respectively .",
    "that is , the energy of the intermediate state after the first hop is @xmath54 inserting eq .",
    "10 then gives @xmath55 introducing the effective hopping between ir sites @xmath56 which is a matrix in spin space ( summation over intermediate spins is implicit ) , this is rewritten as @xmath57 eq .",
    "22 corresponds to the intermediate state @xmath58 in the direct exchange hole pathway eq .  13 with the hopping matrix elements @xmath59 .",
    "therefore division by the ( electron ) energy @xmath60 of the intermediate state eq .  22 and application of the second hop which returns the hole to ir site @xmath13",
    ", we find @xmath61 where the factor of two accounts again for the fact that an identical contribution results from a process in which the hole starts at site @xmath39 .",
    "[ [ simultaneous - channel - sc ] ] simultaneous channel sc : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the ` simultaneous channel ' sc both ir - holes from sites @xmath13 and @xmath39 hop onto o ions in the intermediate state @xmath62 .",
    "this can occur in a process in which the first hole at site @xmath13 and then the hole at site @xmath39 hops , or in the reversed order .",
    "the first hop in this process results in the state @xmath63 is again @xmath64 in eq .",
    "19 . adding then the second hole on the same or a different o ion , we obtain the intermediate state @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 an explicit expression for this intermediate state is given in appendix  a , and we here only remark that its ( electron ) energy depends on whether both holes are on the same o ion or not .",
    "it has the non - interacting contribution @xmath67 , an interaction contribution @xmath68 from removing holes at ir sites @xmath13 and @xmath39 , and the interaction contribution @xmath69 if both holes are on the same o ion and @xmath70 in case they are not .",
    "this can be summarized as @xmath71 the return to the ground state can occur again in two ways , i.e. , a hole returns first to ir at site @xmath13 and then the second returns to site @xmath39 , or in the reversed order .",
    "the overlap of the resulting state with the ground state defines the effective hamiltonian    @xmath72    the calculation of eq .",
    "27 is identical to the one for cuprates in refs .",
    "5,6 . for completeness",
    "we give details in appendix  b , and here merely state that neglecting spin independent contributions , the effective hamiltonian of interest is @xmath73 finally , summing the superexchange contributions from both channels the superexchange contribution is @xmath74 where we introduced @xmath75 note that the expression for @xmath76 differs from that of ref .  .",
    "this difference was previously noted in refs .   in connection with the similar expression in ref .  .",
    "we next want to bring eq .",
    "17 for the direct exchange into the form @xmath77 to this end we insert eqs .  5 and 6 into eq .",
    "17 @xmath78 we then employ the identity ( checked in appendix  b ) @xmath79 to find that @xmath80 is of the form eq .  31 with @xmath81 to do the same calculation for the superexchange eq .  29 ,",
    "let us first rewrite products of hopping matrices @xmath82 where in the last line we introduced @xmath83 we can now apply again eq .",
    "33 to find @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 given in eq .  30 .",
    "in ref .  , we performed local density approximation calculations for the electronic structure of na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , and then performed a tight binding fit within a slater - koster formalism . to understand the tight binding fit , we need to step back and take a look at the electronic structure of this material .",
    "@xcite na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 is composed of iro@xmath87 octahedra , and as with many transition metal oxides , these octahedra are distorted , with just a c@xmath88 symmetry axis preserved . moreover , there are two types of oxygens , with four of the six around an ir ion being of one type ( o2 ) , the other two of the other type ( o1 ) .",
    "note that the two o1 ions are not related by an inversion like in cuprates , but are related by a @xmath89 rotation about the c@xmath88 axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "a minimal tight binding model restricted to near neighbors only would then consist of hoppings of ir to o1 , ir to o2 , o1 to o1 , o2 to o2 , o1 to o2 , and ir to ir . because of the distorted nature of the lattice , not all distances between given atom types are the same . to reduce the number of fit parameters",
    ", we then assumed a typical inverse fourth power dependence of the hopping integrals with distance for a given atom combination . in practice , this affects only the o to o hoppings , and we note that an inverse fourth power behavior was indeed found for iro@xmath88.@xcite the net result is that we need 18 tight binding parameters : energies of @xmath4 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath91 ) 5d orbitals on ir , energies of 2p orbitals on o1 and o2 ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) d - d hoppings ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath3 ) , d - p hoppings ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 for ir - o1 and ir - o2 ) , p - p hoppings ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 for o1-o1 , o2-o2 , o1-o2 ) , and the coefficient of the spin orbit splitting for the ir 5d orbitals , @xmath100 ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) .",
    "these parameters are then used to evaluate the various elements of the secular matrix that generates the eigenvalues.@xcite the diagonal elements are simply given by the various on - site energies , and the spin - orbit coupling matrix elements in a crystal field basis compatible with that used in ref .   can be found in ref .  .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements are of the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the hopping integral between orbital @xmath51 on site @xmath13 and orbital @xmath104 on site @xmath39 , and @xmath105 are the three direction cosines between the two sites at @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in our case ,",
    "the resulting secular matrix has dimension 312 ( there are four formula units in the unit cell , i.e. , there are 120 ir 5d orbitals and 192 o 2p orbitals in the unit cell when spin - orbit is included ) . in considering off - diagonal elements of the secular matrix , note that each iridium ion is surrounded by six oxygens and four other iridium ions ( fig .  1 ) , and each oxygen is surrounded by twelve other oxygens .",
    "once the secular matrix is set up , then the various tight binding parameters are iteratively adjusted to achieve an optimal fit to the band structure eigenvalues .",
    "the function being minimized is a sum of the squares of the differences of the tight binding eigenvalues from the first principles ones of the electronic structure calculation .",
    "the minimization was performed using powell s method.@xcite we first fit the calculation without spin - orbit using 42 eigenvalues ( the bottom and tops of the o1 , o2 , and @xmath5 complexes , as well as all 36 bands of the @xmath4 complex ) at each of the four symmetry points of the simple cubic brillouin zone . as",
    "an initial start to the minimization , we used previously derived tight binding parameters for iro@xmath88,@xcite scaled ( by an assumed inverse fourth power dependence on distance ) to the na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 lattice .",
    "the starting values for the on - site energies were estimated from the orbital decomposed density of states of the band calculation .",
    "after minimization , the resulting tight binding parameters were then used as input to fitting the calculation with spin - orbit , now involving 78 eigenvalues ( the bottom and tops of the o1 , o2 , and @xmath5 complexes , as well as all 72 bands of the @xmath4 complex ) , again at the four symmetry points .",
    "for the initial start , the spin - orbit coupling parameter , @xmath100 , was estimated from the splitting of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 eigenvalues of the band calculation .",
    "after minimization , the resulting fit gave a good reproduction of the energy bands , along with the fermi surface ( figs .",
    "8 and 9 of ref .  )",
    "this is non - trivial , given the low site symmetry of this lattice , the size of the secular matrix , and the large 18 parameter function space .",
    "this fit , though , does not take into account the residual crystal field splitting of the 5d orbitals due to the distortions of the octahedra .",
    "these splittings , although somewhat obscured by hybridization , appear to be present ( fig .  3 of ref .  ) , and could potentially be of importance . including them increases the number of tight binding parameters to 21 ( with two more parameters needed for the @xmath4 manifold and one for the @xmath5 one ) .",
    "a complete description of these splittings are complicated because they involve a number of crystal field potential terms , @xmath110 , whose coefficients are difficult to estimate from first principles .",
    "rather , we used a simplified approach where we ignore the small coupling between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals . for a c@xmath88 axis along ( 1,1,0 ) , the @xmath4 diagonal elements of the secular matrix would be ( relative to @xmath90 ) of the form -2@xmath111 for @xmath112 , and + @xmath111 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with an off - diagonal matrix element @xmath115 between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the sign depending on whether the c@xmath88 axis is along ( 1,1,0 ) or ( 1,-1,0 ) .",
    "diagonalization of this sub - matrix leads to two even symmetry states and one odd symmetry state relative to the c@xmath88 axis .",
    "we note that this simplified form ignores the smaller off - diagonal matrix element between @xmath112 and @xmath116 which would couple the two even symmetry states . for the @xmath5 sub - matrix ,",
    "the diagonal matrix elements ( relative to @xmath91 ) are -2@xmath117 for @xmath118 and + 2@xmath117 for @xmath119 .",
    "diagonalization of this sub - matrix leads to one even symmetry and one odd symmetry state . as the c@xmath88 axis",
    "is rotated from one iridium site to the next , these @xmath4 and @xmath5 sub - matrices in turn must be rotated ( leading to off - diagonal terms between @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) .",
    "the resulting 21 parameter tight binding fit had about a 25% smaller rms error than the 18 parameter one ( the band dispersion from the fit is plotted in fig .  2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the solution space is more complex than in the 18 parameter case , and as a consequence , it is difficult to estimate how well the minimization routine has succeeded in finding an optimal solution . in particular , the @xmath120 parameters ( table i ) lead to effective level splittings for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals that do not seem to correspond well to those indicated by the band structure calculation ( fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "moreover , the fermi surface is somewhat degraded relative to the one of the 18 parameter fit ( fig .",
    "9 of ref .  ) . on the other hand",
    ", the 21 parameter fit corrects a major deficiency of the 18 parameter one , in that @xmath3 , which was anomalously large in the 18 parameter fit ( 0.1545 ev ) , is now far more reasonable ( 0.0521 ev ) .",
    "this , and other differences in the tight binding parameters ( comparing table i with table ii of ref .  ) , turn out to have a qualitative impact on the exchange constants , as we will see in the next section .",
    ".tight binding hopping parameters in ev from the 21 parameter fit .",
    "the on - site energies are @xmath92 = -6.4241 , @xmath93 = -3.9141 , @xmath90 = -1.7230 , @xmath121 = 0.6619 , with the spin - orbit coupling @xmath100 = 0.5797 .",
    "the residual crystal field splittings of the cubic levels on the ir sites are denoted as @xmath120 ( @xmath122 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we can contrast this with the 21 parameter fit , shown in fig .",
    "@xmath123 reaches the experimental value of 28 mev for a @xmath60 of about 1.5 ev , which is close to the anticipated value of 2 ev .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are close in value to @xmath123 .",
    "this indicates a far more isotropic spin hamiltonian , which is in support of various theories for this material . for completeness , we list all the coefficients of the spin hamiltonian in table ii for the 21 parameter fit with @xmath60 = 1.5 ev .",
    "we note not only the effective isotropy of @xmath126 , but also the much reduced value of the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction compared to what was previously indicated in ref .  .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the much smaller value of @xmath60 ( 0.5 ev ) assumed in the previous work . on general grounds ,",
    "we note the dominance of @xmath127 in table ii compared to the other exchange terms , in particular , the large ratio of @xmath127 to @xmath128 .",
    "this is in contrast to the well known case of cuprates , where the superexchange term is dominant .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the 90 degree ir - o - ir bond present in this material compared to the 180 degree cu - o - cu bond found in the cuprates .",
    "other qualitative differences between the 90 and 180 degree cases have been emphasized in the recent work of jackeli and khaliullin.@xcite    finally , we show in fig .",
    "4 the dependence of the exchange constants on @xmath129 . its effect is to cause increased anisotropy .",
    "however , this is more pronounced for the 18 parameter fit than the 21 parameter one . at larger values of @xmath129 than those shown in fig .  4",
    ", there are divergences that are associated with zeros of the denominators entering @xmath76 ( eq .",
    "this corresponds to intermediate states that are low in energy , meaning that perturbation theory is no longer valid .",
    "obviously , for very large values of @xmath129 , the superexchange contributions disappear , leaving only the isotropic direct exchange term .    ) on the oxygen sites , with a repulsion ( @xmath60 ) of 1.5 ev on the iridium sites ; ( a ) is from the 18 parameter tight binding fit and ( b ) from the 21 parameter fit .",
    "the horizontal dashed line is the experimental value for @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite , width=326 ]    from the above , it is obvious that the exchange constants are very sensitive to the tight binding parametrization , and also the values of the various coulomb repulsions .",
    "we also note that higher order processes are ignored , for instance , sixth order superexchange processes involving additional hoppings between the two o ions connecting two ir sites which are known to play a role for the honeycomb lattice found in na@xmath88iro@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite longer range hoppings on the iridium sublattice could also be of importance as well",
    "we have found that an approximately isotropic heisenberg model can be motivated from a tight binding parametrization of the electronic structure of na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , with the experimental value of @xmath130 reproduced for a reasonable value of the coulomb repulsion , @xmath60 . to obtain this result",
    ", it was important to account for the residual crystal field splittings of the ir 5d orbitals due to the octahedral distortions .",
    "our findings are obviously of some importance in regards to models for this quantum spin liquid , since anisotropy acts to stabilize long range magnetic order.@xcite the large value of the exchange is of much interest , since a large @xmath130 appears to be associated with the unusual properties of cuprates , including their d - wave superconductivity .",
