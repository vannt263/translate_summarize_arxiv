    "the structure of quark and lepton mass matrices has been under theoretical study for many years .",
    "whereas the 6 quark masses and the 3 mixing angles and 1 @xmath1 violating phase in the quark sector are now measured with some precision , the lepton sector is still missing some crucial information .",
    "recently , the neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 has been measured by the daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is now centered at around 0.1 means that the previously favored tribimaximal mixing pattern ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) is invalid , although the @xmath7 symmetry  @xcite used to obtain it  @xcite is still applicable with some simple modifications  @xcite . on the other hand , in the simplest application  @xcite of @xmath7 ,",
    "all the quark mixing angles are zero .",
    "the question is whether there exists another symmetry which successfully yields both quark and lepton mass matrices , with good fits of all masses , mixing angles , and phases .",
    "the answer is yes , as elaborated below .    using the non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath0 of the heptagon",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that the @xmath1 violating phase of the quark mixing matrix may be predicted , whereas @xmath0 also yields a pattern  @xcite for the neutrino mass matrix consistent with what is observed .",
    "this pattern is previously derived using the symmetry @xmath8  @xcite , and realizes a specific conjecture  @xcite that the neutrino mass matrix has two texture zeros in the basis that charged - lepton masses are diagonal .    in sec .",
    "2 the symmetry @xmath0 is explained . in sec .",
    "3 the assignments of quarks under @xmath0 are given with the accompanying higgs structure and the resulting mass matrices . in sec .",
    "4 numerical fits to the quark masses and mixing angles are given , with a prediction of the @xmath1 violating phase . in sec .",
    "5 the assignments of leptons under @xmath0 are given with the accompaning higgs structure and the resulting mass matrices . in sec .",
    "6 the neutrino mass matrix is analyzed to show that it allows for nonzero @xmath2 and a specific correlation between it and @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 .",
    "given that @xmath11 is close to the tribimaximal value , it prefers an inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses although a quasidegenerate pattern with either normal or inverted ordering can not be ruled out . in sec .",
    "7 there are some concluding remarks .",
    "the group @xmath0 is the symmetry group of the regular heptagon with 14 elements , 5 equivalence classes , and 5 irreducible representations .",
    "its character table is shown below .",
    "+    .character table of @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a result , the @xmath12 mass matrix is diagonal , coming from the yukawa terms @xmath13 and @xmath14 . as for the majorana @xmath15 mass matrix ,",
    "the allowed yukawa terms are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting mass matrix is thus of the form  @xcite @xmath19 which was first derived using @xmath8  @xcite , and realizes one of the conjectures of ref .",
    "rotating @xmath20 to the tribimaximal basis using @xmath21 it becomes @xmath22 where @xmath23 if @xmath24 , tribimaximal mixing is recovered . in particular , @xmath25 or @xmath26 means that @xmath27 . in previous studies , the special cases @xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite have been explored .",
    "the requirement from @xmath0 that @xmath30 is a new condition which will predict a special correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 .    consider the unitary matrix @xmath31 such that @xmath32 then @xmath33 is the lepton mixing matrix up to phases .",
    "let @xmath31 be approximately given by @xmath34 then for @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 in addition , since the effective neutrino mass @xmath37 in neutrinoless double beta decay is given by @xmath38 whereas @xmath39 we have the relationship @xmath40.\\ ] ] since @xmath41 is very small , this model predicts @xmath42 to a very good approximation .",
    "the structure of eq .  ( 38 ) also shows that an inverted ordering of neutrino masses is expected , although the quasidegenerate limit is also possible in which case either inverted or normal ordering may occur . in the following we focus on the inverted case , i.e. @xmath43 .    for @xmath25",
    ", @xmath44 is rotated to @xmath45 according to @xmath46 as a result , @xmath47 if all parameters are real , then for @xmath48 , @xmath49 would be 0.80 , which is ruled out by present data , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "however , a fit may be obtained for complex values .",
    "we go back to eq .",
    "( 25 ) and observe that @xmath51 may be chosen real , so only @xmath52 is complex .",
    "this means that @xmath53 is real as well as @xmath54 , and for @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "writing @xmath57 as @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61 , \\\\",

    "@xmath81 concluding remarks ------------------    we have studied a specific pattern for both quark and lepton mass matrices . in both cases ,",
    "one mass matrix is diagonal ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) , whereas the other has two zeros ( @xmath84 and @xmath20 ) . in the case of @xmath20 , the assumption that it is majorana corresponds to one of the conjectures of ref .",

    "@xcite using the non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath0",
    ". the conjectured form of @xmath20 was first derived  @xcite using @xmath8 , but it may also be obtained  @xcite using @xmath85 or @xmath0 . here",
    "we consider @xmath0 as the unifying symmetry for both quarks and leptons .",
    "the @xmath1 violating parameter @xmath86 in the quark sector is constrained in this model by @xmath87 . within one standard deviation of all six measurements ,",
    "we obtain @xmath86 in agreement with data . in the neutrino sector , we obtain @xmath66 as well as @xmath64 as functions of @xmath49 and also predict @xmath78 as a function of @xmath49 .",
