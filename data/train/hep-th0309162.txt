    "why is gravity so weak ? or equivalently , why are the proton ( and other hadrons ) so light compared to the planck scale ? as wilczek has explained nicely @xcite , the solution to this hierarchy puzzle results from asymptotic freedom . without any fine - tuning of the bare gauge coupling at distances as short as the planck length ,",
    "a 4-d non - abelian gauge theory like qcd produces a correlation length @xmath3 that is larger than the shortest length scale in the problem , by a factor exponentially large in the inverse coupling .",
    "the inverse correlation length defines a mass scale @xmath4  the proton mass in wilczek s example  that is hence exponentially smaller than the planck scale .",
    "since we consist mostly of these very light particles ( protons and neutrons ) in natural units of their mass we experience gravity as a very weak force .",
    "lattice gauge theorists benefit from the absence of a hierarchy problem in numerical simulations of gauge theories . in this case the shortest length scale ( and hence the analog of the planck length ) is the lattice spacing .",
    "again , thanks to asymptotic freedom , without any fine - tuning of the bare gauge coupling , the physical correlation length can be made arbitrarily large in lattice units .",
    "hence , putting aside practical difficulties due to the limited power of computers , there is no problem of principle in approaching the continuum limit in 4-d yang - mills theories on the lattice .",
    "unfortunately , the situation is not as simple in full lattice qcd including quarks .",
    "in fact , for a long time lattice field theorists have suffered from a hierarchy problem in the fermion sector .",
    "this problem arises when one removes the unwanted doubler fermions by breaking chiral symmetry explicitly , for example , by introducing a wilson term in the lattice fermion action .",
    "recovering chiral symmetry in the continuum limit then requires a delicate fine - tuning of the bare fermion mass .",
    "this is not only a pain in practical numerical computations , but should be considered a serious problem of principle at the heart of the nonperturbative regularization of theories with a chiral symmetry .",
    "when one works in the continuum , one often takes chiral symmetry for granted because it can be maintained in dimensional regularization .",
    "however , the subtleties related to the definition of @xmath5 in the framework of dimensional regularization are just another aspect of the same deep problem of chiral symmetry that is obvious on the lattice .    returning to the hierarchy puzzle",
    ", we should ask why the quarks inside the proton are light .",
    "in particular , we should still be puzzled by the fact that we consist of not just of gluons , but also of light quarks .",
    "certainly , if one imagines wilson s lattice qcd as a ( highly simplified ) model for the short distance physics of our world , without unnatural fine - tuning , quarks would live at the lattice spacing scale , while gluons ( or , more precisely , glueballs ) are naturally light .",
    "fortunately , the long - standing hierarchy problem of lattice fermions  and hence of the nonperturbative regularization of chiral symmetry  has recently been solved .",
    "based on work of callan and harvey @xcite , the first step in this direction was taken by kaplan @xcite who realized that massless lattice fermions arise naturally , i.e.  without fine - tuning , as zero - modes localized on a domain wall embedded in a higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "for example , left - handed fermions in four dimensions can be localized on a domain wall that represents a 3-brane embedded in a 5-d space - time .",
    "similarly , right - handed fermions can be localized on an anti - wall . by keeping the wall and the anti - wall at a sufficiently large distance , i.e.   by spatially separating left- and right - handed fermions in the extra dimension , they are prevented from mixing strongly with one another .",
    "thus , they are protected from picking up a large mass and are naturally light .",
    "since @xmath5 appears in its action , the 5-d theory itself does not even have a chiral symmetry .",
    "hence , in contrast to four dimensions , a wilson term in the 5-d lattice action removes the doubler fermions without doing damage to chiral symmetry .",
    "overlap lattice fermions @xcite also live in an extra dimension and are closely related to domain wall fermions .",
    "when one integrates out the extra dimension , the 4-d version of overlap fermions satisfies the so - called ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite . as lscher first realized , this relation implies a lattice version of chiral symmetry @xcite which led him to a spectacular breakthrough : the nonperturbative construction of lattice chiral gauge theories @xcite .",
    "perfect and classically perfect lattice fermion actions @xcite also obey the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite .",
    "however , the explicit construction of such actions is a delicate problem that can itself be considered a form of fine - tuning .",
    "fermion actions that naturally obey the ginsparg - wilson relation without fine - tuning , on the other hand , can be related to the physics in a higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "the existence of light 4-d fermions may hence be a hint to the physical reality of extra dimensions .",
    "indeed , brane worlds embedded in a higher - dimensional space - time provide a very interesting perspective on ordinary 4-d physics @xcite .    in present lattice qcd applications of domain wall or overlap fermions the extra dimension is not taken physically seriously . in particular , the gluon field is usually frozen in the fifth dimension , thus violating locality in the extra dimension . for left- and right - handed domain wall fermions localized on a wall and an anti - wall ,",
    "one takes the chiral limit by separating the wall from the anti - wall in the extra dimension , while the gluonic correlation length is kept fixed .",
    "consequently , one approaches the chiral limit before the continuum limit , and the extra dimension does not have a physically meaningful extent . in order to cancel singularities resulting from the 5-d bulk , one introduces ghost fields violating the spin - statistics theorem . while all this is not wrong if one only wants to construct 4-d qcd , it is unnatural if one takes the fifth dimension seriously .",
    "there is an alternative nonperturbative formulation of qcd ( and other field theories )  d - theory @xcite  in which the extra dimension is used in a more natural way . in d",
    "- theory the familiar classical fields emerge dynamically from discrete variables ( such as quantum spins or quantum links ) which undergo dimensional reduction . in this formulation of qcd",
    ", gluons emerge dynamically from higher - dimensional physics . starting with a 5-d quantum link model from which a non - abelian coulomb phase with massless gluons emerges",
    ", compactification of the fifth dimension leads to a correlation length ( i.e.  an inverse glueball mass ) that is exponentially large in the size of the extra dimension . as a consequence of asymptotic freedom of 4-d qcd",
    ", the size of the extra dimension then shrinks to zero in physical units as one approaches the continuum limit .",
    "domain wall fermions fit naturally into this framework .",
    "in particular , the chiral and continuum limits are reached simultaneously , the theory is fully local in the extra dimension , no unphysical ghost fields are needed , and the extra dimension completely disappears in the continuum limit via dimensional reduction . if one imagines the d - theory regularization of qcd as an ( again highly simplified ) short distance model of our world , not just gluons , but also quarks are naturally light .",
    "this solves the second part of the hierarchy puzzle : if we assume the existence of a fifth dimension , we need no longer be puzzled why we also consist of light quarks .",
    "in this paper we use the 3-d gross - neveu model @xcite at large @xmath0 as an analytically soluble toy model for illustrating the issues discussed above . using the standard procedure ,",
    "domain wall fermions were applied to the gross - neveu model in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that calculation the fermionic left- and right - handed zero - modes localized on a wall and an anti - wall are coupled by hand .",
    "while this is sufficient if one just wants to construct the 2-d gross - neveu model , it violates locality in the extra dimension .",
    "this is unnatural if one takes that dimension seriously . in this paper , in the spirit of d - theory",
    ", we do take the extra dimension physically seriously and let the left- and right - handed zero - modes communicate through the bulk of the extra dimension by a locally implemented 4-fermion interaction .",
    "then , just as in qcd , the d - theory mechanism of dimensional reduction leads to naturally light fermions without fine - tuning . in our calculation",
    "not even the domain walls on which fermion states can be localized are put by hand .",
    "they arise dynamically from the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath6 chiral symmetry of the gross - neveu model .",
    "the walls play the role of branes and hence our construction can be viewed as an attempt to construct stable brane worlds .",
    "we find exact brane world solutions just relying on the dynamics of the underlying higher - dimensional theory , without making ad - hoc assumptions about where the branes shall be located .",
    "in realistic brane world constructions stabilizing the branes is a highly non - trivial issue . in our model",
    "we construct an exact solution for a fully consistent and stable wall - anti - wall configuration .",
    "although our toy model is very simple , it reveals an interesting mechanism for brane stabilization : if branes are made of fermions ( and thus have a baryon asymmetry ) baryon number conservation in the higher - dimensional theory may imply brane stability .",
    "unfortunately , in our toy `` world '' the baryon asymmetry is so large that all states are occupied with fermions and any potentially non - trivial physics is completely pauli - blocked .    in section 2",
    "basic features of the 2-d gross - neveu model are reviewed , while section 3 discusses the 3-d gross - neveu model . in section 4 the 3-d gross - neveu model",
    "is considered in the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "after compactification of the third dimension , the model undergoes dimensional reduction to the 2-d gross - neveu model by the generation of a correlation length that is exponentially large in the size of the extra dimension .",
    "section 5 discusses dimensional reduction from the chirally broken phase of the 3-d model , using configurations with either one wall or a wall - anti - wall pair . in the wall - anti - wall case",
    "a naturally light dirac fermion is generated with its left- and right - handed components being localized on the two walls .",
    "again , the theory undergoes dimensional reduction to the 2-d gross - neveu model .",
    "the emerging chiral order parameter of the 2-d theory as well as the brane tensions and the issue of brane world stability are also discussed .",
    "finally , section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "a synopsis of this work is given in ref .",
    "in this section , we introduce the 2-d gross - neveu model @xcite as the target theory which we will later obtain from dimensional reduction of the corresponding 3-d model .",
    "various 2-d field theories , including the gross - neveu model , were recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the gross - neveu model at large @xmath0 in the continuum .",
    "its euclidean action is given by @xmath7 = \\int d^2x \\left[{\\overline \\psi}\\gamma_{\\mu } \\partial_{\\mu } \\psi -   \\frac{g}{2n } \\left({\\overline \\psi}\\psi \\right)^2\\right].\\ ] ] we have suppressed a flavor index that runs from 1 to @xmath0 and gives rise to a global @xmath8 flavor symmetry .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is the dimensionless 4-fermion coupling which remains fixed in the t hooft limit @xmath10 .",
    "the explicit factor @xmath11 ensures that the interaction term stays of the same magnitude as the kinetic term in this limit .",
    "in addition to the @xmath8 flavor symmetry , the model has a @xmath6 chiral symmetry @xmath12 where @xmath13    let us consider the @xmath14 limit and derive a gap equation that describes the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath6 symmetry of eq.([symmetry2 ] ) .",
    "first , we introduce an auxiliary scalar field @xmath15 representing the chiral order parameter @xmath16 .",
    "it linearizes the 4-fermion interaction , such that @xmath17 = \\int d^2x   \\left[{\\overline \\psi}\\gamma_{\\mu } \\partial_{\\mu } \\psi   - { \\overline \\psi}\\psi \\phi + \\frac{n}{2 g } \\phi^2 \\right].\\ ] ] the partition function then takes the form @xmath18 ) = \\int { \\cal d}{\\overline \\psi}{\\cal d}\\psi { \\cal d}\\phi \\exp(- s[{\\overline \\psi},\\psi,\\phi]).\\ ] ] in the large @xmath0 limit we may restrict @xmath19 to a space - time - independent constant @xmath20 @xcite . doing so , the action in momentum space takes the form @xmath17 = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2 } \\int d^2k \\",
    "{ \\overline \\psi}(- k)[i \\gamma_\\mu k_\\mu - \\phi ] \\psi(k ) +   \\frac{n v}{2 g } \\phi^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the volume of space - time .",
    "we integrate out the fermion fields @xmath22 ) =   \\exp(- n v v_{eff}(\\phi)),\\ ] ] in order to obtain the effective potential @xmath23 of the chiral order parameter . in the infinite volume limit the fermion integration yields @xmath24 using eq.([epot2 ] ) , the minimum @xmath25 of the effective potential is determined by @xmath26 which implies the gap equation @xmath27 in order to solve the gap equation , a cut - off @xmath28 is introduced in 2-d momentum space .",
    "the ultraviolet limit @xmath29 is reached for @xmath30 and one then obtains @xmath31 the exponential factor in eq.([massgap2 ] ) is a manifestation of asymptotic freedom of the 2-d gross - neveu model .",
    "the factor @xmath32 in the exponent is the inverse of the corresponding 1-loop @xmath33-function coefficient . due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ", the fermions pick up a mass @xmath34 .",
    "the cut - off @xmath28 is removed by varying the bare coupling @xmath9 such that the physical fermion mass @xmath1 remains fixed . after removing the cut - off",
    ", the effective potential takes the form @xmath35 which is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "next we consider the 3-d gross - neveu model @xcite with the euclidean action @xmath36 = \\int d^3x \\left[{\\overline \\psi}\\gamma_\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi + { \\overline \\psi}\\gamma_3 \\partial_3 \\psi -   \\frac{g}{2n } \\left({\\overline \\psi}\\psi \\right)^2\\right].\\ ] ] in three dimensions the 4-fermion coupling @xmath37 has the dimension of a length .",
    "we will soon compactify the third direction or endow it with domain walls and obtain the 2-d gross - neveu model by means of dimensional reduction . hence , in this case , the 3-direction is not euclidean time but just an additional spatial dimension which will ultimately become invisible .",
    "instead , we choose the 2-direction to represent euclidean time . in three dimensions",
    "there is no chiral symmetry because @xmath38 appears explicitly in the action .",
    "still , the 3-d action has a @xmath6 symmetry which reduces to the chiral symmetry of the 2-d gross - neveu model after dimensional reduction , but which also involves a spatial inversion in the 3-direction , @xmath39 later we will consider the @xmath40-independent zero - mode that determines the physics of the dimensionally reduced 2-d gross - neveu model . then eq.([symmetry3 ] )",
    "reduces to the usual 2-d @xmath6 chiral symmetry of eq.([symmetry2 ] ) .    as in the 2-d case , we take the large @xmath0 limit and derive a gap equation @xmath41 introducing a cut - off @xmath42 in 3-d momentum space , and assuming @xmath43 , in the ultraviolet limit @xmath44 we obtain @xmath45 we have introduced the critical coupling constant @xmath46 . at strong coupling , @xmath47 ,",
    "one has @xmath48 , so we are in the broken phase . for weak coupling , @xmath49 , on the other hand",
    ", we are in the symmetric phase . for large @xmath42 ( and up to a trivial additive constant ) the effective potential reduces to @xmath50 in the symmetric phase the effective potential @xmath51 has a single minimum at @xmath52 , while in the broken phase it has two degenerate minima at @xmath53 .",
    "the effective potential in the symmetric and broken phases is depicted in figures 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "in this section we start from the symmetric phase of the 3-d gross - neveu model . by compactifying the third dimension to a circle of circumference @xmath33 ,",
    "the system is dimensionally reduced to the 2-d gross - neveu model .",
    "interestingly , the massless fermion that exists in the bulk of the 3-d gross - neveu model can not remain massless after compactification .",
    "if it would , the size @xmath33 of the extra dimension would be negligible compared to the then infinite fermionic correlation length , and the model would become a massless 2-d gross - neveu model . however , as we have seen , in the 2-d gross - neveu model the @xmath6 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for all values of the coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "hence , as the third dimension is compactified , the previously massless 3-d fermion must necessarily pick up a mass . consequently",
    ", its correlation length @xmath2 will become finite .",
    "then the question arises if @xmath3 is large or small compared to @xmath33 .",
    "let us study the mechanism of dimensional reduction from the symmetric phase in some detail .",
    "the 3-d gap equation with periodic boundary conditions in the third direction takes the form @xmath54 to evaluate the sum , we use the poisson resummation formula and we obtain @xmath55 the gap equation then reads @xmath56 again , we introduce the cut - off @xmath28 in 2-d momentum space and perform the integral . for large @xmath28",
    "we obtain @xmath57 in order to match the 2-d cut - off @xmath28 to the 3-d cut - off @xmath42 , for a moment we consider the broken phase of the 3-d model .",
    "then @xmath58 approaches its constant bulk value as @xmath59 , such that eq.([massgap3to2 ] ) implies @xmath60 we match this with the previous result of eq.([phi0 ] ) by identifying @xmath61 returning to the symmetric phase of the 3-d model , @xmath58 vanishes as @xmath59 and eq.([massgap3to2 ] ) implies @xmath62 interestingly , the correlation length @xmath3 becomes exponentially larger than @xmath33 as @xmath33 itself goes to infinity .",
    "hence , counter - intuitively , as the size of the third dimension becomes large ( in units of the inverse cut - off @xmath63 ) the physical correlation length of the fermion increases exponentially and the low - energy physics reduces to the one of the 2-d gross - neveu model .",
    "there is a hierarchy of three separate length scales in this problem .",
    "the shortest length scale is determined by the inverse cut - off @xmath63 .",
    "the next scale @xmath64 is the size of the extra dimension . finally , the largest length scale @xmath65 is dynamically generated by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the dimensionally reduced 2-d model .",
    "in fact , the size @xmath33 of the extra dimension plays the role of the inverse cut - off for the 2-d gross - neveu model that arises by means of dimensional reduction . identifying the coupling constant of the dimensionally reduced model as @xmath66 eq.([xi ] ) turns into @xmath67 which is nothing but the asymptotic freedom relation eq.([massgap2 ] ) of the 2-d gross - neveu model .",
    "in particular , we identify @xmath68 as the effective cut - off of the dimensionally reduced model .",
    "the same subtle mechanism of dimensional reduction was first observed in the 3-d @xmath69 sigma model @xcite .",
    "however , in that case dimensional reduction results only when one starts in the broken phase of the 3-d model , which contains massless goldstone bosons . as a consequence of the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem",
    ", these particles can not remain massless as the theory dimensionally reduces to two dimensions .",
    "since the @xmath6 symmetry of the gross - neveu model is discrete , the theorem does not apply in this case . in the 3-d gross - neveu model",
    "the massless phase is the one without spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "still , both the 2-d @xmath69 model and the 2-d gross - neveu model are massive , although for different reasons . in the next section",
    "we will see how dimensional reduction arises starting from the broken phase of the 3-d gross - neveu model .",
    "figure 4 shows the chiral condensate ( or equivalently the mass gap ) as a function of @xmath37 both for finite and for infinite @xmath33 .    from the point of view presented in the introduction , the way we have obtained the 2-d gross - neveu model by means of dimensional reduction from the symmetric phase of the 3-d model is not really satisfactory .",
    "since we studied the large @xmath0 limit , an analytic calculation was possible in the continuum using a momentum cut - off that does not break chiral symmetry explicitly . on the other hand , a fully nonperturbative treatment at finite",
    "@xmath0 would require a formulation on the lattice , which leads to the fermion doubling problem .",
    "for even @xmath0 this problem can be avoided using staggered fermions . however , for odd @xmath0 one would use wilson fermions and thus break chiral symmetry explicitly by the regulator . recovering chiral symmetry in the continuum limit then requires unnatural fine - tuning of the bare fermion mass .",
    "the idea of domain wall fermions is to construct naturally light fermions via dimensional reduction from a higher dimension . in the next section",
    ", we will see explicitly how this works in the broken phase of the 3-d gross - neveu model .",
    "dimensional reduction from the symmetric phase , on the other hand , requires a 3-d massless fermion to begin with . in a fully nonperturbative lattice calculation at finite @xmath0",
    "this would require unnatural fine - tuning at the level of the 3-d theory .",
    "hence , the above mechanism of dimensional reduction from the symmetric phase does not work naturally ( i.e.  without fine - tuning ) when the cut - off violates chiral symmetry .",
    "this is why we now turn to the chirally broken phase .",
    "in this section we describe how the 2-d gross - neveu model can arise via dimensional reduction from the broken phase of the 3-d model .",
    "if one would again compactify the third dimension to a circle , the finite correlation length @xmath70 of the fermion in the 3-d bulk would never become large compared to @xmath33 .",
    "hence , with periodic boundary conditions , dimensional reduction would not happen from the broken phase , even in the @xmath71 limit , because the ratio @xmath72 remains non - zero in this limit .",
    "light fermions in @xmath73 dimensions can arise naturally by dimensional reduction from a massive theory in @xmath74 dimensions as zero - modes localized on a domain wall @xcite .",
    "interestingly , domain walls indeed exist as stable topological objects in the broken phase of the 3-d gross - neveu model .",
    "we will see that a system with a single domain wall has a free massless left - handed 2-d fermion living on the wall .",
    "a system with a stable wall - anti - wall pair separated by a distance @xmath33 , on the other hand , supports a left - handed fermion living on the wall as well as a right - handed fermion living on the anti - wall .",
    "the left- and right - handed fermionic zero - modes communicate with each other through the 3-d bulk between the wall and the anti - wall and pick up a mass @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , in analogy to the mechanism of dimensional reduction discussed before , the corresponding correlation length @xmath2 grows exponentially with @xmath33 when one separates the wall from the anti - wall .",
    "hence , in units of the 2-d fermion correlation length @xmath3 , the size @xmath33 of the bulk between the walls shrinks to zero .",
    "consequently , from the low - energy point of view of a 2-d observer living on the walls , the wall - anti - wall system  although truly 3-dimensional  looks exactly like a 2-d space - time .",
    "first we consider a system with a single domain wall separating two distinct broken phases with chiral condensate values @xmath58 and @xmath75 .",
    "the domain wall itself is described by a field configuration @xmath76 that interpolates between the two vacuum states , @xmath77 . determining the shape @xmath76 of the domain wall is a non - trivial problem .",
    "fortunately , a similar problem has been solved a long time ago by dashen , hasslacher , and neveu @xcite in the 2-d gross - neveu model . in that case , the topological object is not a domain wall but simply a solitonic particle . as we will see , the 2-d soliton solution of ref .",
    "@xcite naturally extends to three dimensions . in order to determine @xmath76 we apply the following strategy",
    "first , we make an educated guess ( the 2-d soliton solution ) for @xmath76 .",
    "second , we integrate out the fermions in the given non - trivial background , and we verify explicitly that the resulting @xmath78 self - consistently reproduces @xmath76 . our approach is a 3-d generalization of work by pausch , thies , and dolman @xcite and by feinberg @xcite , and is also related to work by chandrasekharan @xcite .",
    "the ansatz for the domain wall profile which is obvious from what we know about 2-d solitons is given by the standard kink profile @xmath79 we have arbitrarily centered the domain wall at @xmath80 . of course , there is a trivial translational zero - mode which does not concern us here . in minkowski space - time",
    "the fermions propagating in the non - trivial domain wall background field @xmath76 are described by the single - particle dirac hamiltonian @xmath81.\\ ] ] we choose the euclidean dirac matrices to coincide with the pauli matrices , @xmath82 .",
    "after dimensional reduction the 1-direction will remain and  from the low - energy point of view of a 2-d observer  the spatial 3-direction becomes invisible .",
    "using translation invariance of the dirac equation in both , the spatial 1-direction and in time , we make the separation ansatz @xmath83 which implies @xmath84 there is a localized state @xmath85 with the energy eigenvalue @xmath86 .",
    "this state describes a free massless left - handed fermion with spatial momentum @xmath87 localized on the domain wall .",
    "note that the localized states of positive energy are left - movers with @xmath88 . since in 2-d",
    "there is no spin , a left - handed particle is indeed simply moving to the left .",
    "similarly , the particles localized on an anti - wall with the profile @xmath89 are right - movers .",
    "the wall profile as well as the wave function of the localized state are illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "the spectrum of the dirac equation also includes a continuum of bulk states @xmath90 with the energy eigenvalues @xmath91 .",
    "the localized and bulk states together form a complete orthonormal basis of the single particle hilbert space .    in the next step ,",
    "we verify explicitly that the solutions from above self - consistently reproduce the domain wall profile of eq.([profile ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we evaluate @xmath92 summing over the filled dirac sea of negative energy states , in the limit @xmath93 one finds @xmath94 i.e.  the ansatz of eq.([profile ] ) for the profile of the domain wall is indeed reproduced by the actual @xmath78 of the fermions living in the corresponding background field .",
    "the factor @xmath11 has canceled because each negative energy state is filled with @xmath0 fermions .",
    "we have also used eq.([cutoff ] ) to eliminate the cut - off @xmath28 in favor of @xmath37 and @xmath58 .",
    "since the modes localized on the wall have @xmath95 , they have no effect on the self - consistency of the domain wall solution itself .",
    "in particular , one can also fill the negative energy states for those modes and thus construct the usual vacuum for the 2-d physics on the brane . by occupying a localized state @xmath96 with spatial momentum @xmath97 ,",
    "we then obtain a left - moving particle with energy @xmath98 . at low energies @xmath99 the fermions that are localized on the brane",
    "do not feel the extra dimension and see just a 2-d space - time . at sufficiently large energies",
    "@xmath100 , on the other hand , fermions can escape into the extra dimension .",
    "from the point of view of a 2-d observer , this process seems to violate fermion number conservation .",
    "at this point we have explicitly constructed a topologically stable brane on which massless left - handed fermions can propagate as free particles . in the case of a single domain wall ,",
    "the dimensional reduction of fermions from three to two dimensions is straightforward . in the next subsection",
    "we will construct a brane world consisting of a wall - anti - wall pair . in that case",
    ", the mechanism of dimensional reduction is more subtle .",
    "as we have seen , left - handed fermions can be localized on a domain wall .",
    "similarly , right - handed fermions can be localized on an anti - wall .",
    "a world that contains both left- and right - handed fermions should hence contain a wall - anti - wall pair . in order to keep the fermions light ,",
    "the wall and the anti - wall must be separated in the extra dimension by a sufficient distance .",
    "if the low - energy physics of the dimensionally reduced theory happens simultaneously on the wall and the anti - wall , the question arises how the brane separation @xmath33 compares with the natural length scale @xmath3 on the branes .",
    "interestingly , in analogy to the mechanism of dimensional reduction from the symmetric phase that was discussed in section 4 , we will find that , as @xmath33 increases , the length scale @xmath3 grows exponentially such that the brane separation becomes small in the natural physical units of a low - energy observer .",

    "then the upper component of the wave function , which is localized on the anti - wall , tends to zero , and the particle is almost entirely located on the wall .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "the wave function of a fast right - mover , on the other hand , is concentrated on the anti - wall .    at @xmath106 ,",
    "i.e.  at distance @xmath114 between the branes , we end up in the vacuum @xmath115 and the mass of the dirac fermion is simply given by the 3-d fermion mass @xmath116 .",
    "when the branes are separated by a large distance @xmath117 , i.e.  for @xmath118 , on the other hand , the mass of the dirac fermion goes to zero as @xmath119 consequently , when the branes are separated at a large distance @xmath33 , the 2-d correlation length @xmath120 again grows exponentially with @xmath33 and the system dimensionally reduces . in particular , from the point of view of a low - energy 2-d observer , the left- and right - handed modes propagating simultaneously on the wall and the anti - wall are indistinguishable from an ordinary point - like dirac fermion . at the same time , a 3-d high - energy observer whose natural length scale is @xmath121 would say that the dirac particle consists of a left - handed and a right - handed constituent , both separated by a large distance @xmath117 .    in the wall - anti - wall configuration",

    "however , in the wall - anti - wall case , there is also the second term . performing the @xmath126-integration",
    ", that term contributes @xmath127 which needs to be canceled by an appropriate contribution from the states localized on the branes . for these states",

    "those have energy @xmath129 and exactly cancel the contribution @xmath32 in eq.([contribution ] ) . in order to cancel the @xmath130-term in eq.([contribution ] ) as well , we also need to fill some positive energy states ( or , equivalently , empty some negative energy states ) . hence ,",
    "in contrast to the single wall case , the wall - anti - wall configuration is unstable if the 2-d brane world is in its vacuum state . in order to stabilize the brane configuration ,",
    "we occupy all positive energy states localized on the wall ( with energy @xmath131 ) up to some fermi momentum @xmath132 .",
    "the cancellation condition , which determines the value of @xmath132 , then takes the form @xmath133 consequently , the energy of the particles at the fermi - surface @xmath134 is equal to the lowest energy @xmath58 of states propagating in the 3-d bulk of the extra dimension .",
    "any fermion that one adds to the brane world has enough energy to escape into the extra dimension .",
    "thus , our brane world  which indeed contains naturally light fermions  is necessarily completely packed with these particles .",
    "hence , any potentially interesting physics of the light fermions is entirely pauli - blocked , and this `` world '' can only exist in one ( physically quite uninteresting ) state .",
    "this is in contrast to the single - wall case , where any fermion occupation of the localized states was self - consistent with the wall profile .",
    "it should be noted that we have assumed the configuration to be constant in the spatial 1-direction along the brane .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that , at non - zero fermion density , translation invariance may break by the spontaneous formation of a crystal lattice .",
    "if this happens here as well , it is still possible that our brane world displays some non - trivial physics .",
    "this could be investigated along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we have seen , in the wall - anti - wall case a light fermion mode is localized on the branes . in this subsection",
    "we raise the question about the dynamical origin of the fermion mass .",
    "in particular , we ask if it arises as a consequence of chiral symmetry breaking in the dimensionally reduced theory .",
    "let us first discuss the single wall case .",
    "obviously , the wall configuration arises as a consequence of the broken @xmath6 symmetry in the 3-d bulk .",
    "this @xmath6 symmetry is a combination of a 2-d chiral transformation and a reflection about a 2-d plane perpendicular to the 3-direction .",
    "it is interesting to note that the wall profile @xmath135 is invariant against the transformation @xmath136 which combines a 2-d chiral transformation with a reflection at the domain wall center . together with the transformation of eq.([symmetry3 ] ) , this particular @xmath6 symmetry indeed remains intact even in the presence of the domain wall . from the point of view of a 2-d observer living on the brane , this @xmath6 symmetry is nothing but 2-d chiral symmetry . as a consequence of this unbroken @xmath6 chiral symmetry , the fermion localized on the brane is massless .",
    "next we discuss the wall - anti - wall case in which the wall profile is no longer invariant under the transformation of eq.([trans ] ) . as a consequence , there is no exact @xmath6 chiral symmetry from the point of view of the 2-d brane world .",
    "still , as the wall and the anti - wall are separated by a large distance @xmath33 , an approximate chiral symmetry emerges which turns into an exact symmetry at infinite brane separation .",
    "the fermion mass @xmath137 decreases exponentially with @xmath33 .",
    "is this mass due to explicit or spontaneous breaking of the emerging approximate @xmath6 symmetry ? in order to clarify this question , we now compute the value of the chiral order parameter of the dimensionally reduced 2-d theory on the brane . first , we define an effective 2-d fermion field @xmath138 by smearing the 3-d fermion field with the wave function of the modes localized on the right or left side of the brane world . note that the 2-d fermion field , defined in this way , indeed has the correct dimension .",
    "next , we calculate the 2-d chiral condensate @xmath16 . it is straightforward to show that only the modes localized on the branes contribute to this quantity .",
    "the contribution takes the form @xmath139 where again @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the domain wall height @xmath58 serves as a natural cut - off for the physics in the brane world .",
    "hence , we occupy all states with negative energies @xmath142 , and ( for @xmath143 ) we obtain @xmath144 using eq.([massgap ] ) we identify @xmath145 as the effective 2-d coupling constant , and we then indeed obtain @xmath146 just as in the 2-d gross - neveu model . as we have seen in the previous subsection , for reasons of consistency , our brane world can not exist in its vacuum state .",
    "thus , the actual ( non - vacuum ) value of the chiral condensate also receives contributions from states with positive energies @xmath147 and , in fact , even vanishes .",
    "still , since for large @xmath33 the vacuum value of the chiral condensate @xmath25 agrees with the dynamically generated fermion mass @xmath1 , we conclude that this mass actually results from the spontaneous breakdown of the emergent @xmath6 chiral symmetry .",
    "let us consider the question of stability of the brane world . obviously , unlike the single wall , the wall - anti - wall configuration is not topologically stable .",
    "for example , one might worry that the wall and the anti - wall attract each other and annihilate through a continuous deformation of the profile @xmath76 into the trivial vacuum @xmath148 .",
    "the energy stored in the brane tension would then be released and turned into heavy 3-d fermions .",
    "such a catastrophic event would clearly be the end of our brane world .",
    "alternatively , if the wall and the anti - wall repel each other , they would simply drift apart in the extra dimension .",
    "remarkably , in the gross - neveu model the wall - anti - wall configuration is stable against both annihilation and drifting apart .",
    "what is the dynamical mechanism responsible for the stability ?",
    "the key observation is that the wall and the anti - wall themselves consist of fermions  what else could they possibly be made of in this model ?    in the wall - anti - wall case ,",
    "the fermion density is given by @xmath149 let us also calculate the brane tension @xmath150 , i.e.  its energy per unit length .",
    "the brane tension receives contributions from three different sources : the filled bulk states , the filled surface states localized on the branes , and the @xmath151 term .",
    "the latter contributes @xmath152 = - \\frac{2 n a \\phi_0}{g},\\ ] ] while the surface states localized on the branes yield @xmath153 the calculation of the fermionic contribution of the bulk states requires special care .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , we impose periodic boundary conditions in the 3-direction over a finite extent @xmath154 .",
    "note that , in contrast to a single wall , the wall - anti - wall configuration is indeed consistent with periodic boundary conditions . in the finite box",
    "only discrete values for @xmath155 are allowed .",
    "these values are determined by the scattering phase shift @xmath156 as @xmath157 with @xmath158 . for sufficiently large @xmath154 ( such that @xmath159 ) the @xmath155 values are given by @xmath160 in the next step we sum the energy differences between occupied bulk states in the wall - anti - wall and the vacuum configuration @xmath161 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{n}{2 \\pi } \\int dk_1 \\sum_n \\left(k_{3,n } - \\frac{2 \\pi n}{l}\\right )   \\frac{d\\sqrt{k_1 ^ 2 + k_3 ^ 2 + \\phi_0 ^ 2}}{dk_3}|_{k_3 = 2 \\pi",

    "\\delta(k_3 ) \\frac{d\\sqrt{k_1 ^ 2 + k_3 ^ 2 + \\phi_0 ^ 2}}{dk_3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these manipulations , we have taylor expanded around @xmath162 and , at the end , we have taken the @xmath163 limit .",
    "performing a partial integration , using @xmath164 and summing up all contributions to the brane tension , one finally obtains @xmath165 remarkably , the energy per fermion , @xmath166 , is independent of the separation of the walls and equals the mass of a fermion in the 3-d bulk .",
    "consequently , given a fixed number of fermions , they can be divided arbitrarily into some that form the brane world and others that remain at rest in the 3-d bulk .",
    "this explains how our brane world is protected from the dooms - day scenario of wall - anti - wall annihilation .",
    "the branes can accrete fermions that fall onto them , coming from the bulk of the extra dimension .",
    "this process increases the brane separation @xmath33 as well as the fermi - momentum @xmath132 , but it also decreases the fermion mass @xmath1 , such that the energy of the states at the fermi - surface @xmath58 remains fixed .",
    "the thickness of the world @xmath33 increases only logarithmically with the fermion density .    at infinite brane separation , @xmath59 , i.e.  for @xmath118 , the fermion density and the energy density approach two times the corresponding values of a single wall brane world that is completely packed with fermions .",
    "the brane tension for this object is given by @xmath167 .",
    "interestingly , once the wall and the anti - wall are separated by an infinite distance , they can support configurations with any value of the fermi - momentum @xmath168 .",
    "the corresponding brane tension is then given by @xmath169 for instance , an empty single - wall brane world ( in its vacuum state ) costs an energy @xmath170 per unit length .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , light fermions can arise naturally from higher dimensions as states localized on domain walls .",
    "following the ideas behind d - theory , in contrast to standard applications of domain wall fermions in lattice field theory , we have taken the extra dimension physically seriously .",
    "in particular , we have maintained locality in the bulk of the extra dimension , and we have used dimensional reduction to make the extra dimension invisible to a low - energy observer . the 3-d gross - neveu model at large @xmath0 has been used as a toy model in which one can obtain analytical insight into these phenomena . in particular , the gross - neveu model with a discrete @xmath6 chiral symmetry",
    "provides domain walls dynamically through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "interestingly , fermionic zero - modes can be localized on these walls which themselves consist of fermions .",
    "an exact analytic solution was found for a stable wall - anti - wall configuration , and indeed light fermions arise naturally via dimensional reduction in this brane world . remarkably , the wall - anti - wall configuration is stable ( although not topologically stable ) due to the baryon asymmetry of the fermions that the brane is made of .",
    "this mechanism of brane stabilization may be interesting for realistic brane world constructions .",
    "ironically , in our toy model the `` world '' is stable only if the baryon asymmetry is so large that all fermion states are occupied and all physics is completely pauli - blocked .",
    "we take this as a lesson for brane world model building .",
    "our toy `` world '' was free to follow its own dynamics , without us making any ad - hoc assumptions about where branes should be located .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the `` world '' then behaved in some  but not in all respects  as its builders had intended .",
