    "excluded volume interactions in hard - sphere mixtures are interesting for a number of reasons . for one thing , colloidal systems are often modeled as mixtures of dissimilar hard spheres and , experimentally , it is known that this interaction plays an important role in the observed behavior . moreover , due only to the existence of a disparate size ratio between solute and solvent , the ( purely entropic ) effect on the solvent mediated interaction forces between solute particles in a hard - sphere suspension may be quite dramatic .",
    "take for instance the case of two ( not necessarily equal ) big hard spheres immersed in a fluid of small hard spheres .",
    "when the distance between the two big spheres is less than the diameter of the small spheres , the latter may not got into the gap .",
    "this depletion effect induces an imbalance in the local pressure leading ultimately to an effective attraction between the big spheres .",
    "a rather similar phenomenon occurs when , in the presence of say a hard planar wall , one has a single big hard sphere ( solute ) in a sea of small hard spheres ( solvent ) .",
    "the concept of depletion force was first introduced by asakura and oosawa@xcite over fifty years ago in the context of colloid - polymer mixtures . ever since",
    ", a great number of papers devoted to depletion interactions involving hard - sphere mixtures have appeared in the literature .",
    "the approaches have also been varied ranging from experiment,@xcite density functional theory,@xcite computer simulations,@xcite virial expansions,@xcite the derjaguin approximation,@xcite or the integral equation formulation of liquid state theory.@xcite    very recently we have addressed the problem of deriving the density profiles of multicomponent hard - sphere mixtures near a planar hard wall@xcite using an alternative approach to the integral equation theory for the structural properties of the system.@xcite the main aim of this paper is to complement our former results with the study of the depletion potential for various systems involving hard - sphere mixtures . specifically we will deal with the depletion interaction between two different ( big ) hard spheres immersed in a multicomponent mixture of ( small ) hard spheres . a limiting case of this situation",
    "is when the diameter of one of the big spheres becomes infinite and so this sphere is seen as a hard planar wall both by the other big sphere and by the multicomponent mixture of small spheres .",
    "it should be emphasized that our approach represents an improvement over the percus  yevick ( py ) theory .",
    "in fact , it retains the major asset of the latter , namely it also yields analytical results in laplace space .",
    "further , our approach is technically simple too , so that the improvement over the py theory is not achieved at the expense of adding difficulty to the theoretical development .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we provide a relatively simple derivation of the asakura ",
    "oosawa depletion potential by looking at the exact results for the radial distribution functions of a multicomponent hard - sphere mixture to first order in density .",
    "this is followed in section [ sec3 ] by a summary of the results for the structural properties of a multicomponent hard - sphere mixture obtained by using the rational function approximation ( rfa ) method.@xcite this section also includes the limit where two of the species in the mixture ( the solute ) are present in vanishing concentration and the special cases where the solute particles have equal diameters or one is seen as a wall both by the other solute particle and by the solvent .",
    "section [ sec4 ] presents the results both of the depletion potential and the depletion forces for some illustrative cases and compares them with available computer simulation data.@xcite we close the paper in section [ sec5 ] with a discussion of the results and some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we present a simple derivation of the asakura  oosawa depletion potential@xcite that follows from exact results of the structural properties of multicomponent hard - sphere mixtures rather than the original geometrical arguments .",
    "let us consider an @xmath0-component hard - sphere mixture in which the closest distance between a sphere of species @xmath1 and a sphere of species @xmath2 is @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 can be considered as the `` diameter '' of a sphere of species @xmath1 .",
    "the mixture can be either additive , i.e. , @xmath5 , or nonadditive , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "the number density of the mixture and the mole fraction of species @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "to first order in @xmath7 , the radial distribution functions @xmath9 are exactly given by g_ij(r)=g_ij^(0)(r)+g_ij^(1)(r)+(^2 ) , [ 8ao ] where g_ij^(0)(r)= ( r-_ij ) , [ 9ao.0 ] g_ij^(1)(r)=_k=1^n+2 x_k g_ij;k^(1)(r ) , [ 9ao ] g_ij;k^(1)(r)&=&[r^2 + 2(_ik+_kj)r-3(_ik-_kj)^2 ]   + & & ( _ ik+_kj - r)^2(r-_ij)(_ik+_kj - r ) .

    "now we assume that the mole fractions of species @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( here labeled as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ) vanish , so that the other species ( @xmath15 ) constitute the solvent . in that case , the depletion potential @xmath16 for the effective interaction between the solute spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by u_ab(r)=-g_ab(r ) , [ 1ao ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 the absolute temperature . according to eqs .   and , to first order in @xmath7 ( and for @xmath22 ) , one has u_ab(r)=-g_ab^(1)(r ) , [ 2ao ] so that , taking eqs .   and into account , u_ab(r)&=&-_i=1^n x_i(_ai+_bi - r)^2[r^2 + 2(_ai + & & + _ bi)r-3(_ai-_bi)^2](_ai+_bi - r ) . + [ 3ao ]    if both solute spheres are identical ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , eq .",

    "oosawa expression.@xcite    note that the validity of eq .   to first order in @xmath7 actually extends to _ any _ interaction among the solvent particles , including the so - called asakura  oosawa model ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , i.e.",
    ", only the solute - solvent ( @xmath26 and @xmath31 ) and solute - solute ( @xmath30 ) interactions need to be those of hard spheres .",
    "we must also point out that eq .  , while applying to first order in density only , is quite general in the following sense : ( i ) the solvent may be in general polydisperse , ( ii ) the solute - solvent and solute - solute hard - sphere interactions are not necessarily additive , and ( iii ) the two solute spheres may have arbitrary sizes .",
    "we remark that , in general , the depletion potential @xmath16 is not a polynomial function of distance but a polynomial of degree four divided by the distance between the centers of spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 . only in the cases",
    "@xmath36 [ see eq .  ] and @xmath37 [ see eq .  ] does the potential become a polynomial ( of degree three ) .",
    "the results of this section are exact but restricted to a low - density solvent .",
    "in particular , the asakura ",
    "oosawa potentials turn out to be purely attractive ( with a range corresponding to the diameter of the solvent particles ) and scale with the solvent density .",
    "neither of these features remains as the density is increased . while it would be nice to have some measure of the error made in using eqs . or in actual situations",
    ", there is unfortunately no clear - cut way to estimate such an error .",
    "instead , we note that , according to the qualitative discussion performed in ref .  , the entropic force grows faster than the bulk density and becomes repulsive for distances on the order of half the diameter of the solvent particles .",
    "hence , in order to account for these and other finite - density effects on the depletion interaction one must adopt a different strategy and resort to approximations . in the next section we present our analytical approach , which includes the py approximation as a particular case .",
    "in this section we start by recalling the main aspects of the rfa method for multicomponent hard - sphere mixtures@xcite and refer the interested reader to our recent review paper@xcite and references therein for details .    as in the preceding section ,",

[ fig5 ] ]    as can be seen from the figures , the rfa results certainly represent an improvement over the py theory in all cases for both the depletion force and the depletion potential , yielding in particular much better values for the well depth in the depletion potential .",
    "our analysis will begin with the cases where both solute particles have the same size ( @xmath111 ) , namely those in figs . when @xmath104 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) the oscillations of both the rfa and the py curves are slightly dephased with respect to the simulation data .",
    "a similar behavior is exhibited by the density functional theory shown in fig .",
    "2a of ref .  .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] also shows that the depletion force is a much more stringent quantity than the depletion potential .",
    "in particular , the py theory predicts a local minimum of @xmath112 ( associated with an inflection point of @xmath113 ) at @xmath114 , while both the rfa and the simulation data present a monotonic increase of @xmath112 in the region @xmath115 . if @xmath106 ( figs . , the performance of the rfa with respect to the depletion force becomes poorer as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath107 , but the theory is still able to capture even quantitatively all the features of the depletion potential for @xmath108 and @xmath109 . for @xmath105 , paradoxically in contrast to the case @xmath104 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it follows correctly the trend of the oscillations but otherwise overestimates the barrier height . although not shown here and most likely related with the previous deficiency , also for @xmath105 the force starts to present features that seem not to occur in the simulations .",
    "we will come back to this point later on in connection with the hard planar wall limit @xmath116 .",
    "now we turn to a more stringent situation , namely the case where the depletion effect takes place between a hard planar wall and a solute sphere , i.e. , @xmath116 . in this instance , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , the agreement between the rfa results and the simulation data is also reasonably good . particularly rewarding",
    "is the fact that , at least for @xmath108 , one gets a good performance even when @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "analogously to the cases with @xmath111 , the rfa strongly improves over the py results for distances @xmath117 from the wall but both theories practically coincide for larger distances .",
    "also , the py theory predicts a spurious local minimum of the depletion force near @xmath118 . it should be pointed out that in the planar wall limit one also starts to get a peculiar behavior , not shown in the figures , for relatively low densities ( @xmath109 if @xmath110 ) .",
    "this behavior , also shared by the py theory , has similar features to the ones mentioned in connection with the poorer performance for some systems having @xmath119 , that is , the appearance of spurious local minima in the depletion forces and of inflection points in the depletion potentials . while in the case @xmath111 within the rfa approach they may have their origin on the decreasing reliability of the contact values of the radial distribution functions with increasing size disparity @xmath120 , when @xmath116 the features have to do with the fact that in the hard planar wall limit the radial distribution functions both for the py theory and in the rfa may become negative around the first minimum , @xcite which is clearly unphysical .",
    "in this paper we have derived the depletion force and potential between two ( in principle different in size ) large spheres whose interaction is mediated by the presence of a multicomponent hard - sphere mixture ( the solvent ) composed of smaller particles .",
    "this has been done by using the rfa approach and the end results turn out to be completely analytical in laplace space .",
    "one may say that the rfa approach not only retains the analytical character of the py theory and the good performance of this latter at long distances , but it has some further assets as well .",
    "hence , apart from the elimination of the thermodynamic consistency problem , it is also able to correct the main drawbacks in the py formulation in connection with the present problem , namely the poor prediction of the short distance behavior and of the well depth in the depletion potential and the non - divergent character of the stickiness parameter in the colloidal limit . since it seems natural that the most relevant part of the depletion potential be the one corresponding to short distances , the improvement over the py result in this particular region may be considered as a success of the rfa approach .",
    "but the fact that after such an improvement one can also cater for the ( correct ) long and intermediate distance behaviors represents another nice feature of the approach .",
    "it should be clear that , while for simplicity in the illustrative examples we have considered that the solvent is a monocomponent fluid , our development is far more general allowing us in principle to examine the same problem but with the solvent being a polydisperse hard - sphere mixture.@xcite as far as we know , no simulation data for such a system are available and so a comparison in this instance is not possible yet .",
    "in general , our expectation that the rfa produces reasonably accurate results both for the depletion forces and the depletion potential for low and moderate densities , provided the solute - solvent size ratio @xmath120 is not too big , is fulfilled .",
    "we have already pointed out one of the limitations of the rfa approach ( also present in the py theory ) , namely the fact that in extreme conditions it may lead to unphysical ( negative ) values for the distribution function @xmath121 , which in turn yield spurious features in the depletion interaction @xmath122 .",
    "one technical point must be mentioned at this stage .",
    "it concerns the choice of contact values for the radial distribution functions of the mixture and the isothermal susceptibility .",
    "while here we have considered the ecsk3 contact values [ see eq .  ] and an isothermal compressibility @xmath58 that is thermodynamically consistent [ see eq .  ] , the rfa approach does not forbid the possibility of other choices .",
    "for instance , for high values of @xmath120 one could instead take the simulation results or the _ ad hoc _ proposal of henderson and chan@xcite for the contact value @xmath123 .",
    "however , we have checked that , when using the empirical @xmath123 , the region where @xmath121 takes negative values does not disappear , although those values become less negative .",
    "we would expect of course that the more accurate the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the isothermal susceptibility we use as an input , the better the performance of our development .",
    "this , however , remains to be assessed .",
    "finally , we want to point out that in this paper we have restricted ourselves to the infinite dilution limit of the two solute particles . this has allowed us to equate the depletion potential with the potential of mean force .",
    "if the concentration of the solute is increased , this approximation will cease to be valid .",
    "an important asset of the rfa is that it also yields analytical expressions for the direct correlation functions and the bridge functions of the mixture .",
    "these expressions could in principle be used for finite concentrations of the solute , for instance following the formulation of the depletion potential made by castaeda - priego _ _ et al.__@xcite this we plan to do in future work .",
