    "<S> overall , we find that imrs is observed for a wide range of structural and dynamical parameters of the system ( see supplemental material  @xcite , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : lorenz - robustness ] for similar robustness observed for a continuous - time system ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the low levels of coherence between node @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) and the nodes in b are maintained over a range of parameter values , following dependence patterns similar to those of the coherence levels within b ( see supplemental material  @xcite , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : cohe - ab ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> low coherence between periphery and intermediate nodes has also been observed in certain cases of remote synchronization  @xcite [ but with pairs of identically synchronized oscillators in the intermediate part of the network , which is not compatible with the imrs condition ( iii ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> a key aspect of imrs lies in its behavior against noise . </S>",
    "<S> while the synchronization of nodes @xmath1 and @xmath0 is robust against independent noise added to the dynamics in a and c only up to a certain level ( which is expected ) , imrs is completely insensitive to noise in b , even when the noise level is very high ( see supplemental material  @xcite , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : robustness - noise ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this characteristic robustness of imrs stems from the mirror symmetry and is also associated with the dynamical incoherence in condition ( iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , ( remote ) synchronization of nodes @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be extremely sensitive to noise in b when some nodes in b are identically synchronized . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated using the network topology considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see supplemental material  @xcite , sec .  [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : non - robustness - noise ] ) .    our demonstration of imrs challenges the notion that paths of communication between nodes that are exchanging information should be somehow observable . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly striking feature of imrs we studied here is that the coupling between a and b , as well as b and c , is bidirectional . </S>",
    "<S> this allows information to be transferred from a to c through b , despite the scrambling of that information by the incoherent chaotic dynamics of b , which reduces the amount of shared information in b to a level that is too low for eavesdroppers ( as measured by mutual information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this feature fundamentally sets imrs apart from a master - slave type of chaos synchronization  @xcite , in which the dynamics of b influences that of a and c , but not vice versa , thus prohibiting communication between nodes @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> similar master - slave synchronization can be observed even when b is replaced by noise , if the average of the noise is nonzero and its effect is equivalent to parameter change that drives the dynamics into synchrony  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a defining characteristic of imrs we demonstrated is the dynamical incoherence within group b , which is allowed in the presence of the mirror symmetry we established as a general condition for observing imrs . </S>",
    "<S> while we focused on undirected networks here , an analog of mirror symmetry can be formulated for directed networks using the notion of input equivalence  @xcite . since zero - lag synchronization of distant areas of the brain has been experimentally observed  @xcite , our results suggest the intriguing possibility that a mirror symmetry is hidden deep inside the synaptic connectivity structure . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that our discovery will spark the interest of many researchers and lead to further discoveries of fundamental connections between hidden network symmetry and emergent collective behavior in complex systems .    </S>",
