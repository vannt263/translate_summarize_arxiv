    "the boundedness and decay properties of solutions to the scalar wave equation @xmath3 on the exterior regions of kerr black hole backgrounds @xmath4 have been the subject of considerable recent activity , in view of the intimate relation of this problem to the stability of these spacetimes themselves in the context of einstein s theory of general relativity ( cf .",

    "see also  @xcite .",
    "our  @xcite also obtained such decay results in the general subextremal case @xmath1 , under the assumption that @xmath7 is itself axisymmetric .",
    "( let us mention also the previous non - quantitative study  @xcite of fixed azimuthal modes on kerr . )",
    "the main significance of these restrictive assumptions is that the well - known difficulty of superradiance is controlled by a small parameter ( the case @xmath6 ) or is in fact completely absent ( the case of axisymmetric @xmath7 ) .",
    "the present paper represents the culmination of this programme by dropping these restrictions , extending the above boundedness and decay results to the _ general subextremal case @xmath1 without axisymmetry _ :",
    "general solutions @xmath7 of @xmath8 on the exterior of a kerr black hole background @xmath9 , arising from bounded initial energy on a suitable cauchy surface @xmath10 , have bounded energy flux through a global foliation @xmath11 of the exterior , bounded energy flux through the event horizon @xmath12 and null infinity @xmath13 , and satisfy a suitable version of `` local integrated energy decay '' .    2 .",
    "similar statements hold for higher order energies involving time - translation invariant derivatives .",
    "this implies immediately uniform bounds on @xmath7 and translation - invariant derivatives to arbitrary order , up to and including @xmath12 , in terms of a sufficiently high order initial energy .",
    "the precise statements of parts 1 and 2 of the above theorem will be given in section  [ statementsections ] as theorems  [ theresult ] and  [ h.o.s . ] .",
    "note that these are exact analogues of theorems 1.2 and 1.3 of  @xcite , dropping the assumption of axisymmetry ( alternatively , theorem 1.1 dropping the assumption @xmath14 ) .",
    "the main results of the present paper have been previously announced in our survey paper  @xcite , which provided both an outline of the proof and many details of the crucial arguments , including all high frequency multiplier constructions . to complete the outline ,",
    "one required a quantitative refinement of whiting s classical mode stability result  @xcite and a continuity argument in the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the former refinement has very recently been obtained  @xcite and will be indeed used in our proof . as for the latter ,",
    "the proof presented here introduces a streamlined continuity argument which as an added benefit in fact _ reproves _ the theorems of the first parts of the series  @xcite in the case @xmath6 .",
    "we will only rely on  @xcite for a detailed discussion of the background , the setup and several of its elementary propositions .",

    "as stated , the above theorem and its corollary concern the black hole exterior .",

    "this insight goes back to  @xcite . on the other hand , by a result of  @xcite , uniform non - degenerate energy boundedness can not hold up to the cauchy horizon in view of the blue - shift .",
    "uniform @xmath17 bounds on @xmath7 and its _ tangential _ derivatives up to and including the cauchy horizon have been obtained in the thesis of franzen  @xcite .",
    "besides the kerr family , there is an additional class of black hole spacetimes of interest in classical general relativity : the sub - extremal kerr  newman metrics .",
    "these now form a @xmath18-parameter family of metrics , with parameters @xmath2 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( the latter representing _ charge _ ) , which , when coupled with a suitable maxwell field associated to @xmath20 , satisfy the _ einstein ",

    "see  @xcite .",
    "let us note however , that kerr - de sitter is still not understood in its full subextremal range , in particular in view of the absence of an analogue of the mode stability statements  @xcite .",

    "we refer the reader to the many additional references in the first part of this series  @xcite , our survey  @xcite and our lecture notes  @xcite . ]",
    "returning to the classical astrophysical domain , let us recall finally that the kerr metrics @xmath30 represent black hole spacetimes in the full _ closed _ parameter range @xmath31 ; the geometry of the extremal case @xmath32 , however , exhibits several qualitative differences , most conspicuously , the degeneration of the celebrated _ red - shift effect _ at the horizon . in view of the recently discovered _ aretakis instability _",
    "@xcite , the precise analogue of the above theorem _ does not _ in fact hold without qualification in the case of extremality @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , in the extremal case , for generic solutions , certain higher order time - translation - invariant derivatives asymptotically blow up along the event horizon .",
    "this generic blow up is completely unrelated to superradiance and holds even for solutions @xmath7 restricted to be _",
    "axisymmetric_. for such axisymmetric @xmath7 , restricted decay results of a definitive nature have been obtained by aretakis  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental remaining problem for scalar waves on black hole backgrounds of interest in classical general relativity is thus the precise understanding of the for general -axisymmetric solutions .",
    "we begin with an overview of the difficulties of the problem and the basic elements of the proof . in this discussion",
    ", we will assume some familiarity with the schwarzschild and kerr families of metrics as well as basic aspects of the analysis of wave equations on lorentzian manifolds .",
    "see our lecture notes  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed at length in the first parts of this series  @xcite the various difficulties connected to showing energy boundedness and `` integrated local energy decay '' for solutions of the wave equation @xmath8 in the very slowly rotating case .",
    "we review these briefly .",
    "already in the schwarzschild case @xmath5 , to show boundedness , one must face the difficulty that at the _ event horizon _ @xmath12 , the conserved @xmath33-energy ( associated to stationarity of the metric ) degenerates . to show integrated local energy decay",
    ", one must moreover understand both `` low '' and `` high '' frequency obstructions to dispersion , in particular , the high - frequency obstructions connected to the presence of _ trapped null geodesics_.    the horizon difficulties were overcome by our introduction of the red - shift vector field  @xcite , while the difficulties concerning both excluding low frequency obstructions and quantifying the high frequency phenomena connected to trapped geodesics were overcome in one go by appeal to the energy identity of morawetz - type ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) multipliers associated to a vectorfield @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a carefully chosen function vanishing at the so - called photon sphere @xmath36 , the timelike cylinder to which all trapped null geodesics asymptote . in the schwarzschild context , such morawetz estimates were pioneered by  @xcite .",
    "the boundedness of the nonnegative space - time integral given by the energy identity associated to this multiplier is precisely the statement of `` integrated local energy decay '' .",
    "see also  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of any such estimate at trapping is necessary in view of a general result of sbierski  @xcite in the spirit of the classical  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that such a degenerate estimate indeed holds ( and the precise nature of the degeneracy ) means that the trapping is `` good '' ; at the level of geodesic flow , this corresponds to the fact that dynamics is hyperbolic near the trapped set .",
    "this estimate also degenerates at the event horizon when only the initial conserved @xmath33-energy is included on the right hand side . on the other hand , as shown in  @xcite , again using the red - shift vector field , this degeneracy is removed by replacing the latter with the initial _ non - degenerate _ energy .    turning from schwarzschild to the very slowly rotating kerr case @xmath6 ,",
    "the above difficulties are combined with a new one : _",
    "superradiance_. now , the vector field @xmath33 is spacelike in a region outside the horizon known as the _ ergoregion _ , hence its energy identity gives no obvious _ a priori _ control over the solution .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the high - frequency obstructions to decay can not be captured from classical physical space vector field multipliers  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen at the level of geodesic flow as the projection of the trapped space to physical space is no longer a codimension-@xmath37 hypersurface .",
    "the problem of superradiance was first overcome in our proof of boundedness  @xcite mentioned previously , which concerned in fact the more general setting of the wave equation on backgrounds that are small axisymmetric stationary perturbations of schwarzschild , a class including the very slowly rotating kerr case @xmath6 . in this class of spacetimes , one can analyse solutions with respect to frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to the stationary and axisymmetric killing fields , and decompose general solutions @xmath7 of @xmath8 into their superradiant and non - superradiant part . for the latter part",
    ", one can prove boundedness as in schwarzschild .",
    "for the superradiant part , it turns out that one can explicitly prove _ both _ boundedness and integrated local energy decay perturbing a schwarzschild energy identity yielding both positive boundary and space - time terms that do not degenerate .",
    "the non - degeneracy of this estimate encodes the fact that the _ superradiant part of @xmath7 is not trapped_. we shall return to this insight later in our discussion of the general @xmath1 case .    turning to the issue of proving decay for @xmath6 , the problem of capturing the good properties of trapping",
    "was overcome using _ frequency - localised _ generalisations of the morawetz multipliers applied in schwarzschild .",
    "there have been three independent approaches  @xcite , which all crucially rely on the additional hidden symmetries of kerr that are reflected in the existence of a killing tensor and separability properties of both geodesic flow and the wave equation itself . in our approach",
    "@xcite , the frequency localisation uses directly carter s separation of the wave equation  @xcite , which introduces , in addition to @xmath40 and @xmath41 above , a real frequency parameter @xmath42 parameterised by an additional parameter @xmath43 such that , localised to each frequency triple @xmath44 , the wave equation @xmath8 reduces to the following second order o.d.e .",
    "@xmath45 where @xmath46 is a potential and @xmath47 denotes differentiation in a rescaled @xmath48 coordinate .",
    "the frequencies @xmath49 are themselves eigenvalues of an associated elliptic equation whose eigenfunctions ( known as oblate spheroidal harmonics ) appear in the formula reconstructing @xmath7 from @xmath50 .",
    "note that in the schwarzschild ( @xmath5 ) case , the reduction to @xmath51 corresponds to the classical separation by spherical harmonics , and we have explicitly @xmath52 ( independent of @xmath40 ) and @xmath53 for all @xmath49 , the potential @xmath54 has a unique simple maximum at an @xmath16-value @xmath55 such that @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "one sees thus the relation of this potential to the trapping phenomenon .",
    "indeed , the radial dependence of null geodesics with fixed energy and angular momentum is governed by a potential which coincides with @xmath46 above in the high frequency rescaled limit .",
    "in the kerr case , the eigenvalues @xmath42 are no longer explicit expressions , and the form of @xmath46 is considerably more complicated .",
    "it was shown , however , in  @xcite , that for @xmath6 and for frequencies in the `` trapping '' regime @xmath58 the potential @xmath46 retains its `` good '' schwarzschild properties .",
    "specifically , the potential @xmath46 in @xmath51 can be seen to again have a unique simple maximum in this frequency range , whose @xmath16-value @xmath59 depends on the frequency parameters @xmath60 this allows , separately for each @xmath61 , the construction of an analogue of the current @xmath34 vanishing exactly at @xmath59 , yielding the desired positivity properties . unlike the schwarzschild case , however , there does not exist a unique high frequency limit of @xmath59 , consistent with the fact  @xcite that these currents can not be replaced by a classical vector field defined in physical space .",
    "see however  @xcite . at the level of geodesic flow ,",
    "this precisely reflects the fact that trapped null geodesics exist for a full range of @xmath16-values in a neighbourhood of @xmath36 .",
    "can be understood more conceptually , using the structural stability properties of normal hyperbolicity , provided the latter condition is checked for schwarzschild ; see  @xcite .",
    "note however that these stability properties depend on strong regularity assumptions on the metric , whereas our original boundedness theorem  @xcite only requires closeness to schwarzschild in @xmath62 .",
    "thus one expects the domain of validity of  @xcite to be strictly bigger than the class of spacetimes where decay results of the type of our main theorem hold . ]    in the remaining frequency regimes , one can in fact simply carry over the previous physical - space schwarzschild constructions ( see our argument in  @xcite ) to the more general @xmath63 case , as , restricted to those ranges , the relevant schwarzschild estimates _ do not _ degenerate and thus their positivity properties are manifestly stable to small perturbation . alternatively , as in the first parts of this series  @xcite , one can construct new currents taylored specifically to these frequency ranges .",
    "the latter approach is more flexible ( it has the additional benefit of providing  @xcite an independent second proof of the schwarzschild case ) and will be more useful for the general subextremal case @xmath1 .",
    "let us note that our proof of integrated decay in the first part of this series  @xcite in fact gives a separate proof of the boundedness statement of  @xcite , when the latter is specialised to kerr . here",
    ", one exploits the fact that when @xmath6 , superradiance is controlled by a small parameter and thus boundary terms of the wrong sign can be absorbed by a small multiple of the red - shift current added to the conserved @xmath33 energy .",
    "one obtains thus boundedness and integrated local energy decay at the same time , without separating the solution into its superradiant and non - superradiant parts .",
    "we shall see , however , that for the general case @xmath1 , the original insight of  @xcite will again be fundamental .    in discussing our frequency analysis for both the problems of boundedness and integrated local energy decay , we have suppressed an important point : to define frequencies @xmath64",
    ", we are applying the fourier transform in time .",
    "since solutions are not known _ a priori _ to be sufficiently integrable in time , however , one must first apply suitable cutoffs in the future , generating error terms which must then be absorbed . for this ,",
    "some weak _ a priori _ control of these terms is essential  and here we have used in both  @xcite yet again the closeness to schwarzschild .",
    "the analogue of this procedure for the general @xmath1 case is our appeal to the continuity argument of section  [ continuityintro ] .",
    "we defer further discussion of this till then .      in passing to the general subextremal case @xmath1 , the first fundamental issues that must be addressed are the `` high frequency '' ones .",
    "the most obvious question is whether the structure of trapping retains its `` good '' properties which allow in principle for degenerate integrated decay statements . at the same time , since superradiance is no longer governed by a small parameter , one has to understand what is it which finally quantifies its strength , or , in the context of the proof , how does one guarantee the control of boundary terms in space - time energy identities .    though geodesic flow and various measures of the strength of superradiance have been thoroughly investigated in physics  @xcite , the properties that turn out to be essential for our argument do not appear to have been considered explicitly in the classical literature . indeed , it is somewhat of a miracle that the kerr geometry turns out to be well behaved on both accounts , , specifically :    1 .",
    "_ the structure of trapping is as in schwarzschild . _ 2 .   _",
    "superradiant frequencies are not trapped .",
    "_    the embodiment of properties ( a ) and ( b ) we shall need were proven already in our survey paper  @xcite by analysing the potential @xmath46 in @xmath51 . concerning ( a ) , the `` trapping '' frequency range @xmath65 , the potential @xmath46 was shown to have a unique simple maximum @xmath66 at a ( frequency dependent ) @xmath16-value @xmath59 , just as in the slowly rotating case @xmath6 .",
    "( this shows _ a fortiori _ that the underlying null geodesic flow near trapping is hyperbolic . ) concerning ( b ) , it was shown that for high _ superradiant _ frequencies , @xmath67 the maximum of @xmath46 is always `` quantitatively '' above the energy level @xmath68 , in the sense @xmath69 ( this in turn shows _ a fortiori _ that future directed null geodesics whose tangent vector has nonnegative inner product with @xmath33 are never future trapped ; they will always cross the event horizon @xmath12 .",
    "vanishes , this is intimately related to the fact that there are no trapped null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath33 .",

    "_ note that in contrast to the @xmath6 case , the stronger statement that @xmath33 is eventually timelike along any future trapped null geodesic is not true ; i.e.  it is not true that all future trapped null geodesics must leave the ergoregion .",
    "_ )    as with the @xmath6 case , it is not statements about geodesic flow that we appeal to , but rather we use directly the properties of the potential @xmath46 to construct appropriate energy currents .",
    "more specifically , the above properties of the potential are used to construct frequency dependent multiplier currents yielding both positive bulk _ and positive boundary terms _ for all high frequency ranges . in the superradiant case",

    "note that these high - frequency multiplier constructions all appeared explicitly in our survey  @xcite .",
    "we will repeat these constructions here with very minor modifications .",
    "see the outline in section  [ outlinesection ] below .",
    "it is interesting to note that property ( b ) above in fact degenerates in the extremal limit @xmath71 in the following sense : at the endpoint of the superradiant frequency range @xmath72 , one loses the @xmath73 in @xmath70 .",
    "this is an additional ( and separate ) phenomenon to the degeneration of the red - shift and could have interesting implications for the remaining problem of understanding non - axisymmetric @xmath7 in the extremal case @xmath32 .",
    "see  @xcite and the discussion in  @xcite .",
    "the above still leaves us with the problem of understanding _ bounded _",

    "one must first distinguish the near stationary case @xmath75 .",
    "this frequency range is very sensitive to global aspects of the geometry .",
    "it turns out that here an explicit multiplier construction is possible which adapts our construction of the first parts of this series  @xcite .",
    "( interestingly , the cases of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are here handled differently . )",
    "these multiplier constructions appear for the first time in the present paper .",
    "turning now to the remaining bounded frequencies , as explained in our survey  @xcite , whereas in the _ non - superradiant _ regime , one can explicitly construct multipliers with both nonnegative bulk and boundary terms , for bounded non - superradiant frequencies , adapting the constructions of  @xcite from the @xmath6 case , there does not appear to be a straightforward such construction for the superradiant regime , when neither can superradiance be treated as a small parameter , nor can one exploit @xmath70 together with either @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath49 as a large parameter .",
    "one can indeed construct currents with a non - negative _ bulk _ term , but these generate a boundary term of the wrong sign which still must be controlled .    as announced already in  @xcite , to control the remaining term one requires a quantitative extension of whiting s celebrated mode stability  @xcite , which in particular excludes the presence not just of growing modes but also resonances on the real axis .",
    "this was achieved in the recent  @xcite .",
    "appeal to  @xcite will indeed allow us to control the remaining boundary term .",
    "again , see the outline in section  [ outlinesection ] below .      to obtain higher - order integrated local energy decay in the slowly rotating case @xmath6 , it was sufficient to commute @xmath8 with @xmath33 ( which is killing ) and also with the red - shift vector field ( the latter an argument first applied in  @xcite ) , exploiting the fact that the latter , though not killing , generates positive terms in appropriate energy estimates modulo terms which can be controlled by the @xmath33-commutation . to show this fact , one uses in turn that control of a second derivative of @xmath7 in a timelike direction",
    "allows control of all second derivatives of the solution via elliptic estimates ( in view of equation @xmath8 ) .    for the general case @xmath1 , one appeals to yet another fundamental fact about kerr geometry :    1 .   _ the span of the stationary @xmath33 and axisymmetric @xmath78 killing fields is timelike outside the horizon for the full range @xmath1 . _",
    "thus , commuting with @xmath33 , @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 is a cutoff function with compact support in @xmath16 ) and the red - shift vector field , one can essentially apply the same argument as before .",
    "we now return to the issue that we have suppressed at the end of section  [ reviewsr ] , namely , the question of how can one justify in the first place a frequency analysis based on real frequencies @xmath40 defined via the fourier transform in time . in the case @xmath6 , closeness to schwarzschild gave a small parameter that could be exploited here . for the general @xmath1 case , however ,",
    "as explained already in our survey  @xcite , one must exploit a continuity argument in @xmath81 .",
    "note first that to justify the fourier assumption and thus prove integrated local energy decay , one sees easily that it is sufficient to assume the non - quantitative assumption that the energy through @xmath11 of the projection @xmath82 of @xmath7 to each azimuthal frequency is finite .",
    "this is the statement that we show by continuity : for each azimuthal frequency number @xmath83 , we define the subset @xmath84 we will show that @xmath85 is a non - empty open and closed subset of @xmath86 , and thus , @xmath87 .",
    "we turn to a brief account of the continuity argument .",
    "the non - emptyness of @xmath85 follows from the general boundedness result for black hole spacetimes without ergoregions proven in  @xcite , specialised to the schwarzschild case @xmath5 .    for openness",
    ", one shows that if @xmath88 , then @xmath89 satisfies @xmath90 for sufficiently small @xmath73 .",
    "one exploits here @xmath73 as a small parameter .",
    "the issues associated to openness already appeared in the small @xmath6 case ; see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the fact that we have fixed the azimuthal mode @xmath41 makes the argument here technically easier to implement . for this",
    ", the fundamental insight is that    1 .   trapping occurs _ outside the ergoregion_. 2 .   using the energy identity for a vector field of the form @xmath91",
    ", one can obtain boundedness modulo lower order terms supported only in the ergoregion .    to exploit the above",
    ", we first construct from a fixed-@xmath41 solution @xmath82 to @xmath8 on @xmath30 and for each @xmath92 , a solution @xmath93 of the inhomogeneous wave equation @xmath94 on an interpolating metric @xmath95 which coincides with @xmath30 in the region between @xmath10 and @xmath96 and coincides with @xmath97 in the region in the future of @xmath98 and to which the integrability properties apply ( since @xmath99 ) . applying our estimates and using 1 .  and 2 .",
    ", we may now absorb ( for sufficiently small @xmath73 ) the error terms arising from the inhomogeneity to obtain an integrated decay statement for @xmath82 .",
    "we note that the fixed-@xmath41 currents used for 1 .  and 2",
    ".  may find additional applications .",
    "closedness is easy given the estimates shown and the smooth dependence of the kerr family on the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the frequency analysis on which our proof of integrated local energy decay is based does not directly `` see '' the energy flux on fixed time hypersurfaces @xmath11 , only the energy fluxes on the horizon @xmath12 and future null infinity @xmath13 .",
    "thus , it remains to show boundedness of the energy ( and higher - order energies ) through @xmath11 .    in the slowly rotating case @xmath6 ,",
    "it is clear that given integrated local energy decay , boundedness of the energy flux through a spacelike foliation easily follows _ _ a posteriori _ _ by revisiting the physical space energy identity of a globally timelike vector field which coincides with @xmath100 where the latter is timelike , noting that , if @xmath81 is sufficiently small @xmath100 is timelike near trapping .",
    "the above argument again uses in an essential way the disjointness of the ergoregion and the set  associated to trapping  on which integrated local energy decay estimate degenerates .",
    "as we have remarked earlier , these sets intersect when @xmath101it is only in phase space where superradiance can be understood as disjoint of trapping .",
    "one approach to boundedness could be to try to exploit again property ( b ) from section  [ highfreqinsec ] .",
    "it is technically easier to simply exploit the physical space fact ( c ) of section  [ hoehere ] , namely that killing fields @xmath33 and @xmath78 together span a timelike subspace outside the horizon .",
    "specifically , in a small neighbourhood of any @xmath16-value there exists a combination of @xmath33 and @xmath78 which is timelike and killing .",
    "we use our frequency analysis to partition a solution @xmath7 of the wave equation into finitely many pieces @xmath102 , each of which satisfies an analogue of integrated local energy decay degenerating only in a small neighbourhood of some @xmath103 . applying the energy estimates corresponding to a suitable @xmath104-dependent combination of @xmath33 and @xmath78 to each @xmath102 , and summing , one obtains the desired non - degenerate uniform boundedness of the energy flux through @xmath11 .",
