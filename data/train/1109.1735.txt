    "<S> we study the @xmath0 decay mode of a heavy cp - even higgs boson of the nmssm , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lightest cp - odd higgs state of this scenario , the former produced in association with a bottom - antibottom pair , and find that , despite small event rates , a significant ( in fact essentially background free ) signal should be extractable at the lhc with very high luminosity , so long that a @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 represents a jet ) and @xmath5 final state is exploited , in presence of @xmath6-tagging .    the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , owing to the introduction of an extra complex higgs singlet field , which only couples to the two mssm - type higgs doublets , embeds a higgs sector which comprises a total of seven mass eigenstates : a charged pair @xmath7 , three cp - even higgses @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and two cp - odd higgses @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consequently , higgs phenomenology in the nmssm can be very different from that of the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> as a key example , over the past few years , there have been several attempts to extend the so - called ` no - lose theorem ' of the mssm  stating that at least one mssm higgs boson should be observed through the usual sm - like production and decay channels at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) throughout the entire mssm parameter space @xcite  to the case of the nmssm @xcite . from this perspective , it was realised that at least one nmssm higgs boson should remain observable at the lhc over the nmssm parameter space that does not allow any higgs - to - higgs decay mode . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when a light non - singlet ( and , therefore , potentially visible ) cp - even higgs boson , @xmath12 or @xmath1 , decays mainly to two very light cp - odd higgs bosons , @xmath13 , one may not have any higgs signal of statistical significance at the lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , further violations to the theorem may well occur if one enables higgs - to - sparticle decays ( e.g. , into neutralino pairs , yielding invisible higgs signals )  . while there is no conclusive evidence on whether a ` no - lose theorem ' can be proved for the nmssm at the lhc </S>",
    "<S> , there has also been put forward an orthogonal approach : to see when a , so to say , ` more - to - gain theorem ' for the lhc @xcite can be formulated within the nmssm . </S>",
    "<S> that is , whether there exist regions of the nmssm parameter space where more and/or different higgs states are visible at the lhc than those available within the mssm .    in our attempt to overview both such possibilities , </S>",
    "<S> we assume here a light cp - odd higgs boson , @xmath2 , emerging from the decay @xmath14 , where the heavy cp - even state , @xmath1 , is produced in association with @xmath6-quark pairs at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> this work complements the one carried out in a previous paper where the light @xmath2 state is produced in pairs from decays of not only @xmath1 states but also @xmath12 ones , always from the aforementioned production mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct @xmath2 production in association with @xmath15 pairs was considered in @xcite for the case of @xmath5 as well as @xmath16 decays , in @xcite for the case of the @xmath17 channel and in @xcite for the @xmath18 mode .    for our study of the nmssm higgs sector </S>",
    "<S> we have used nmssmtools @xcite , which is a numerical package computing the masses , couplings and decay widths of all the higgs bosons of the nmssm in terms of its input parameters at the electro - weak ( ew ) scale . </S>",
    "<S> nmssmtools also takes into account theoretical constraints as well as experimental limits , including the unconventional channels relevant for the nmssm .    here , instead of postulating unification or taking into account the susy breaking mechanism , we fix the soft susy breaking terms to a very high value , so that they give a small or no contribution at all to the outputs of the parameter scans . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we are left with six free parameters at the ew scale , uniquely defining the nmssm higgs sector at tree - level . </S>",
    "<S> our parameter space is in particular identified through the yukawa couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the soft trilinear terms @xmath21 and @xmath22 , plus tan@xmath23 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets ) and @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the vev of the higgs singlet ) .    in order to make a comprehensive study of the nmssm parameter space </S>",
    "<S> , we have used nmssmtools to scan over the aforementioned six parameters taken in the following intervals :    @xmath26 + @xmath27 + @xmath28    soft terms which are fixed in the scan include : + @xmath29 tev , + @xmath30 tev , + @xmath31 tev , + @xmath32 tev . </S>",
    "<S> + we have finally performed our scan over 2@xmath3310@xmath34 randomly selected points in the specified parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the points which violate the constraints ( either theoretical or experimental ) are automatically eliminated by nmssmtools .    </S>",
    "<S> the surviving data points are then used to determine the cross - sections for nmssm higgs hadro - production by using calchep @xcite for signals and madgraph @xcite for backgrounds . as the susy mass scales have been arbitrarily set well above the ew one ( see above ) , </S>",
    "<S> the nmssm higgs production modes exploitable in simulations at the lhc are those involving couplings to heavy ordinary matter only . amongst the productions channels onset by the latter , we focus here on @xmath35 i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , higgs production in association with a @xmath6-quark pair , followed by @xmath36 ( incidentally , notice that @xmath12 is never heavy enough to enable sizable @xmath37 decays ) and then @xmath38 notice that we discard here the possibility of @xmath39 decays , for two reasons : on the one hand , the mass region below the @xmath40 threshold is severely constrained ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; on the other hand , the @xmath41 decay rates are @xmath42 times suppressed with respect to the @xmath40 ones , so that they would be numerically irrelevant ( see forthcoming figures ) . </S>",
    "<S> as for @xmath18 decays , while being in turn more numerous than the @xmath40 ones ( above the @xmath43 threshold ) by an amount @xmath44 , they are overwhelmed by qcd backgrounds in @xmath45  + jet final states . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the @xmath2 masses of relevance to this study will typically range between 15 and 60 gev or so .    </S>",
    "<S> we adopt herein cteq6l @xcite as parton distribution functions , with scale @xmath46 , the centre - of - mass energy at parton level , for all processes computed . </S>",
    "<S> we finally assume @xmath47 tev throughout for the lhc energy . </S>",
    "<S> also , in our numerical analyses , we have taken @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 gev for the ( running ) bottom- and ( pole ) top - quark mass , respectively , while we have input @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev for the ( pole ) tau- and ( pole ) muon - lepton mass , respectively .    as an initial step towards the analysis of the data , we have computed the production cross - section @xmath52 times the decay br@xmath53 against the br itself , </S>",
    "<S> see fig .  1 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ fig : mass ]    in summary , we have proven that there exists a small but well defined region of parameter space where the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states of the nmssm , both with a mixed singlet and doublet nature , could potentially be detected at the lhc if 250 gev @xmath54 300 gev and @xmath55 gev @xmath56 gev , in the @xmath57 mode , when the cp - even higgs state is produced in association with a @xmath15 pair for rather large tan@xmath23 , large ( and positive ) @xmath58 , large ( and negative ) @xmath21 , and slightly negative @xmath59 , for typically perturbative values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . after a realistic @xmath60 analysis at parton level </S>",
    "<S> , we have in fact produced results showing that the extraction of such a signal above the dominant irreducible sm background should be feasible using standard reconstruction techniques @xcite and large lhc luminosities , i.e. , after several years of running at design values or rather promptly at the super - lhc @xcite . while more refined analyses , incorporating @xmath61-decays , parton shower , hadronisation and detector effects , are needed in order to delineate the true discovery potential of the lhc over the actual nmssm parameter space , we are confident that our results are a step in the right direction to both : ( i ) prove the existence of a ` more - to - gain theorem ' at the cern collider for the nmssm with respect to the mssm ( as higgs  @xmath62  higgs signals are only possible in the latter scenario in parameter space regions already excluded by experimental data ) and ( ii ) to establish a ` no - lose theorem ' for the nmssm at the lhc ( as some of the parameter regions where the aforementioned signal can be detected overlap with those where @xmath63 decays might be ineffective in extracting an nmssm higgs signal ) . </S>"
