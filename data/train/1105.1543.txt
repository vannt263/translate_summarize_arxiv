    "three major questions regarding relativistic jets in radio loud extragalactic radio sources that are of fundamental interest are , `` how powerful is the typical radio jet ? '' , `` how frequently do quasars produce long term jets ? '' and `` how is the jet power related to the accretion flow thermal luminosity ? '' .",
    "the signature of long term powerful jets are the radio lobes of fanaroff - riley ii ( fr ii ) radio sources .",
    "quasars with double radio lobes are conspicuous , but quite rare .",
    "thus , radio selected samples are typically used to address the questions above since sufficient sample size is required for statistical merit .",
    "most radio loud sources , is usually defined as a 5 ghz flux density 10 times larger than the @xmath9 flux density , @xmath10 @xcite . ] do not display radio lobes with the resolution and dynamic range of first @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to find the frequency of the fr ii phenomenon in quasars and the complete distribution of their kinetic luminosity , one must have the ability to detect lobe emission that is below the fr i / fr ii divide .",
    "the fr i / fr ii distinction is both a morphological and luminosity classification . in terms of long term",
    "average jet power , @xmath4 , this approximate boundary is at @xmath11 ergs / sec @xcite .",
    "this divide corresponds to a 1.4 ghz flux density @xmath12 mjy at @xmath13 , well within the sensitivity of the first radio survey , even if the emissivity is distributed over 10 beamwidths ( see equation ( 1 ) , below ) . thus , the extant databases are now at a point where the questions above can be addressed rigorously .",
    "we intend to study @xmath4 with a carefully selected , large sample of sdss dr7 quasars ( @xmath0 ) that is cross - referenced to the first database . selecting the sources in this way reveals prominent narrow lines ( [ oiii ] @xmath145007 and [ oii ] @xmath143727 ) and two broad lines h@xmath15 @xmath144861 and mg ii @xmath142798 in the sdss spectral window for all objects .",
    "this allows us to compare the various derived properties in the context of a single sample of objects in a way that removes the uncertainties associated with sample selection biases if a different set of objects and lines are used for the analysis depending on redshift .",
    "the cross - correlations between the different estimators of the photo - ionizing continuum allow us to segregate out the effects of doppler beaming and line emission created by jet induced shocks , thereby reducing systematic uncertainties in the bolometric luminosity , @xmath8 , the broadband thermal luminosity from ir to x - ray , of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .    in the next section",
    ", the sample is described as well as the extended radio flux data reduction and the optical spectra data reduction .",
    "the third section summarizes the distribution of @xmath4 that is found .",
    "the fourth section discusses the correlations of @xmath4 with the optical / uv spectral parameters .    , computed by means of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . ]",
    "in order to determine the dependence of line luminosity on the thermal continuum in a quasar , we constructed a sample of sdss dr7 quasars with @xmath0 and spectra with a median s / n @xmath1 7 , this yielded 10069 agns .",
    "this base sample has been analyzed previously for other purposes in @xcite .",
    "the sdss dr7 data was cross - referenced to the first database . of these , there were 9270 sources found within these first fields that comprise our sample .",
    "most of the radio loud sources did not have extended radio flux with the dynamic range and resolution of first . indicating a sub - galactic compact structure or very weak , fr i level , extended emission .",
    "the optical spectra were reduced as in @xcite yielding the following for every quasar : the optical / uv continuum luminosity from 5100 @xmath16 to 3000 @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the luminosity of the broad components of h@xmath15 @xmath144861 , @xmath18 , and mg ii @xmath142798 , @xmath19 , and the luminosity of the narrow lines [ oiii ] @xmath145007 , @xmath20 , and [ oii ] @xmath143727 , @xmath21 .",
    "the spatial resolution associated with the interferometer beamwidth of the first survey is @xmath22 20 kpc at z = 0.4 and @xmath22 30 kpc at z = 0.8 .",
    "the optically thin extended flux density on scales of this size and larger can be used to estimate the long term time averaged kinetic energy flux in a jet , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "first observations are at a fairly low frequency , 1.4 ghz , so they are sensitive to steep spectrum optically thin emission . resolved emission at 1.4 ghz is very likely to be optically thin @xcite .",
    "thusly motivated , we want to extract this extended flux from the first radio database for the sdss quasars .    the first step was to cross - reference all first sources within 30 `` of the sdss sources .",
    "each one of these radio fields was inspected visually .",
    "diffuse emission that is roughly concentric with either the optical quasar position , or an unresolved radio core located within 3 '' of the optical position , is considered extended emission of the quasar .",
    "this would be core - halo type emission .",
    "components within 10 `` of the optical / radio core are considered extended emission .",
    "distant components located 10 '' to 70 \" from the quasar / radio core position are considered to be associated with the quasar if there is an extension or jet pointing towards the direction of the optical quasar / radio core position , or if there is a second distant component located on a line that passes close to this optical quasar / core position ( i.e. , a classical triple ) .",
    "we also considered partially resolved sources in the image plane , quantifying the extended emission as the integrated flux minus the peak flux .",
    "other configurations were not considered extended flux associated with the quasar ( either chance background sources or core flux ) .",
    "the most accurate estimates of @xmath23 should use an isotropic estimator such as the radio lobe flux .",
    "the sophisticated calculation of the jet kinetic luminosity in @xcite incorporates deviations from the overly simplified minimum energy estimates into a multiplicative factor @xmath24 that represents the small departures from minimum energy , geometric effects , filling factors , protonic contributions and low frequency cutoff .",
    "the quantity , @xmath24 , is argued to be constrained between 1 and 20 . in @xcite , it was further determined that @xmath24 is most likely in the range of 10 to 20 .",
    "thus , choosing a value of @xmath25 , @xcite converted the analysis of @xcite to the formula in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , even though it is just a time average .",
    "it is assumed throughout this letter that @xmath26=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this formula is an isotropic method that allows one to convert 151 mhz flux densities , @xmath29 ( measured in jy ) , into estimates of @xmath4 ( measured in ergs / s ) : @xmath30^{\\frac{6}{7}}\\mathrm{ergs / s}\\;,\\\\ & & z \\equiv 3.31-(3.65 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\left[(1+z)^{4}-0.203(1+z)^{3}+0.749(1+z)^{2 } + 0.444(1+z)+0.205\\right]^{-0.125}\\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the total optically thin flux density from the lobes ( i.e. , * no contribution from a doppler boosted jet or the radio core * ) .",
    "the spectral index is defined by the convention , @xmath31 .",
    "the appropriate application of this equation requires that one must extricate the diffuse lobe emission from the doppler boosted core and jet .",
    "the expression , ( 1 ) , requires 151 mhz flux densities , so we extrapolate the 1.4 ghz extended flux from the first observation . without further knowledge , for lobe emission @xmath32 is the most typical value found in @xcite , and this value is used to extrapolate the 1.4 ghz flux density to 151 mhz .",
    "these extrapolations were also cross - referenced to any available low frequency data in ned for a consistency check .",
    "there is no evidence that a significant amount of flux was resolved out by the first beam size . for a discussion of the errors implicit in equations (",
    "1 ) and ( 2 ) , see the discussions of @xcite .",
    "the independent derivation in @xcite indicates that most estimates in a large sample will be accurate to within a factor of 2 .",
    "figure 1 is a histogram of @xmath4 for the 266 quasars with detected extended radio emission .",
    "notice that there is a partition associated with an approximate fr",
    "i / fr ii dividing line at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the histogram shows that the first sensitivity in this redshift range is capable of detecting fr i level extended emission .",
    "there are 220 fr ii sources above the fr i / fr ii divide and 46 sources below the divide .",
    "this corresponds to 2.3% of the optically selected quasars",
    "have fr ii level extended emission and @xmath3 have fr i level extended emission .",
    "the fraction that are fr i sources would certainly increase with deeper radio observations .",
    "the fraction that are fr ii would also likely increase with deeper radio imaging ( change some fr i levels to fr ii levels ) as faint diffuse flux is likely swamped by the first rms noise .",
    "the frequency of 2.3% for the fr",
    "ii quasars is consistent with the value of 1.7% deduced by @xcite since their sample has a mean of @xmath34 , so many faint , diffuse fr ii sources ( that are prominent in figure 1 ) would be difficult or impossible to detect with first sensitivity at these high redshifts , hence their lower deduced rate of occurrence .",
    "the significant fraction of fr i extended flux densities is consistent with the discovery of quasars with fr i extended radio emission in @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of this study is that the peak of the quasars extended luminosity distribution is resolved in figure 1 due to the first sensitivity in this redshift range .",
    "it shows that the most frequent luminosity ( for sources with extended emission ) is definitely at the fr ii level .",
    "the peak level of the histogram is @xmath35 with marginal evidence of a second peak at @xmath36 .",
    "only 33 sources have @xmath37 , @xmath22 0.3% .",
    "although powerful fr ii quasars ( @xmath37 ) are prominent in low frequency radio surveys such as the 7c survey , @xcite , these sources are extremely rare , perhaps the rarest subclass of quasar - an order of magnitude rarer than low ionization broad absorption line quasars @xcite .",
    "whatever physical phenomenon creates these large values of @xmath4 must be very difficult to achieve and maintain for long periods of time in a quasar environment .",
    "the blue continuum luminosity is the most basic signature of the thermal emission from the quasar , so it is the most commonly used quantity for estimating @xmath8 .",
    "perhaps the most popular bolometric correction is the simple one proposed by @xcite , @xmath38 . clearly , using a portion of the optical / uv continuum",
    "is more accurate than a single point and we have that at our disposal , @xmath17 . in @xcite , in another study of these 10,069 sdss sources , the @xcite relation was converted to @xmath39 @xmath17 is the most direct way to estimate @xmath8 .",
    "one can also estimate @xmath8 from the spectral luminosity at 3000 @xmath16 for the sources in this sample .",
    "the average spectral index of the optical / uv continuum for the radio quiet sources in the sample of 10,069 quasars was found in @xcite to be @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the @xcite estimator can also be realized as @xmath42    it is interesting to see if there is a strong relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath4 as has been inferred for radio galaxies in @xcite . an uncertainty in equation ( 3 ) , in the the context of radio sources ,",
    "is the high frequency tail of the synchrotron emitting jet and its potential to dilute the pure @xmath17 from the accretion flow .",
    "our carefully selected sample ameliorates these concerns .",
    "we have other reliable surrogates for @xmath8 .",
    "the synchrotron tail dies of rapidly with frequency in the optical / uv and the big blue bump from the accretion disk becomes more prominent in the uv @xcite .",
    "the spectral index of @xmath43 of the optical / uv synchrotron tail in quasars is typically , @xmath44 , compared to the accretion spectral luminosity with @xmath40 for the 10,069 sources in the sdss quasar sample @xcite .",
    "thus , the ratio of the synchrotron tail luminosity ( @xmath45 ) to the accretion luminosity is typically @xmath46 times larger at 5100 @xmath16 than at 3000 @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , if synchrotron dilution is significant , there should be a noticeable difference in the correlations of quasar parameters with @xmath17 and those with @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that the broad components of mg ii and in particular h@xmath15 are excellent surrogates for the underlying accretion disk luminosity .",
    "these spectral parameters are available for all sources in our sample .",
    "figure 2 shows that @xmath18 is an excellent surrogate for @xmath17 for our radio sources as well .",
    "the best fit relationship displayed at the top of the plot is nearly linear .",
    "the tight correlation is evidence that doppler beaming of the high frequency tail of the synchrotron jet is not a major contaminant to the continuum luminosity measured by sdss in a statistical sense .",
    "we explore the correlations between the spectral features and @xmath4 in the correlation matrix , table 1 .    cccccccc    ' '' ''    & @xmath17 & @xmath48 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath4 +    ' '' ''    @xmath17 & 1 & 0.985 & 0.869 & 0.732 & 0.525 & 0.379 & 0.314 + @xmath48 & 0.985 & 1 & 0.871 & 0.775 & 0.522 & 0.367 & 0.313 + @xmath18 & 0.869 & 0.871 & 1 & 0.799 & 0.636 & 0.468 & 0.417 + @xmath19 & 0.732 & 0.775 & 0.799 & 1 & 0.565 & 0.397 & 0.421 + @xmath49 & 0.525 & 0.522 & 0.636 & 0.565 & 1 &",
    "0.844 & 0.507 + @xmath50 & 0.379 & 0.367 & 0.468 & 0.397 & 0.844 & 1 & 0.467 + @xmath4 & 0.314 & 0.313 & 0.417 & 0.421 & 0.507 & 0.467 & 1 +    the statistical metric of choice is the spearman rank correlation coefficient in table 1 .",
    "as expected , @xmath17 and @xmath48 are tightly correlated and their correlations with @xmath18 are also tight ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the most intriguing aspect of table 1 and figure 3 is that the weakest correlation with @xmath4 is from the continuum itself and then @xmath18 .",
    "the correlations of @xmath4 with the narrow line strengths are more significant than with the broad lines or the continuum .",
    "a lack of a strong correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath17 is consistent with the right hand panel of figure 4 of @xcite based on a sample of optically selected radio loud quasars .     versus @xmath51 for the 266 quasars with extended luminosity .",
    "the dashed lines are the 2.5 @xmath52 level scatter from the linear fit that were chosen to highlight the small number of sources below the trend - line that might be significantly affected by doppler boosting . ]",
    "many previous studies have shown a strong correlation between narrow line strengths and @xmath4 for radio galaxies @xcite . however , the more direct indicators of the continuum in table 1 ( the broad lines and a direct view of the continuum itself ) either did not exist or were hidden by the dusty torus @xcite . it was shown in @xcite that a narrow line luminosity is not nearly as accurate of a measure of @xmath8 , as @xmath17 or a broad line luminosity .",
    "it seems that the interpretation of the correlation of @xmath50 with @xmath4 for the relatively powerful 7c sources in @xcite in terms of a strong correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath4 might need some revision . in table 1 , the correlations of @xmath50 and @xmath49 are stronger with @xmath4 than with @xmath17 or @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that jet propagation is a comparable or more significant source of excitation energy than photo - ionization for the o ii emitting gas in fr ii radio sources .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath49 is superior to @xmath50 as a measure of @xmath8 , due to at least two effects : the dependence on the ionization parameter , @xcite , and contamination by star formation in host galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , correlations with @xmath49 have a more direct physical interpretation . for o iii , the source of excitation for",
    "the narrow line gas might be roughly an equal mix of photo - ionization energy and jet induced energy based on the correlation strengths in table 1 .",
    "thus , the narrow line strength and @xmath4 are dependent statistical quantities .",
    "so , if a narrow line strength is used as a surrogate for @xmath8 in a correlation analysis or scatter plot with @xmath4 then the probability of large outlier sources ( i.e. , large @xmath4 and small narrow line strength ) is greatly diminished compared to a scatter plot in the @xmath4 - @xmath8 plane ( i.e. , large @xmath4 and small @xmath8 ) because @xmath4 is itself a strong source of narrow line emitting gas .",
    "this interpretation seems to rectify a discrepancy seen here and elsewhere in the literature .",
    "consider the bimodal scatter in the ir luminosity/ radio luminosity plane noted by @xcite in their figure 1 .",
    "they concluded that significant @xmath4 can exist in sources where there is essentially very little accretion thermal luminosity as well as in sources with large ( quasar - like ) @xmath8 .",
    "conversely , the correlation between narrow line strength and @xmath4 in @xcite led to the conclusion that accretion power was very closely linked to jet power .",
    "based on table 1 , this difference in interpretation arises because a strong radio source with a weak ionizing continuum is still likely to be a major source of narrow line emission , thereby keeping these sources correlated with narrow line strength - even though they are not correlated with @xmath8 .",
    "an important point to bear in mind is that only a small range of optical luminosity is probed here , with most sources being within one order of magnitude . given the very large scatter in some of these correlations , it is clear that over such a small range of luminosity , correlation statistics can give low values .",
    "observations over many orders of magnitude with the same scatter would give much higher correlation coefficients , e.g. the correlations of @xcite .",
    "however , the scatter in these relationships is still significant , 0.54 dex @xcite .",
    "versus @xmath51 and on the right is the same for @xmath53 for the 266 quasars with detected extended luminosity .",
    "since the two scatter plots look very similar , the effects of doppler beaming must be negligible within the sample as discussed in the text .",
