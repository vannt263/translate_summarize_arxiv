    "it seems to be generally recognized that the relative scarcity of experimental data on hyperon - nucleon and especially hyperon - hyperon interactions calls for major theoretical input to arrive at a satisfactory description of the data@xcite . from the boson exchange point of view such a description is typically approached by  upgrading \" a reliable description of the @xmath2-interaction with su(3 ) flavor symmetry , assuming of course that the formulation of the @xmath2-interaction admits such a generalization .",
    "an example of this approach can be found in the construction of the nijmegen potentials ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the one - boson exchange potentials obtained in this way generally predict the existence of loosely bound hyperons , while ruling out deeply bound hyperons .",
    "an alternative approach which is well tailored to address the construction of hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon potentials is one based on the skyrme model@xcite . it has already been successfully implemented in the construction of the nucleon - nucleon potential , as reviewed recently by walhout and wambach@xcite . in the skyrme model",
    "deeply bound hyperons also seem to be excluded once casimir energies are properly taken into account@xcite , but deuteron - like states , for which a skyrmion product ansatz description seems to suffice , remain possible .",
    "an analysis of such configurations to determine hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon potentials have in fact recently been carried out by klbermann and eisenberg@xcite where much of the focus is on the central interactions .",
    "no conclusive statements about the existence or otherwise of bound states seem to have emerged from these two studies .    before we indicate below that the su(3 ) skyrme model construction of hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon potentials can indeed lead to qualitative and quantitative results , it is perhaps worthwhile to point out that such an approach has the further merit that it ties together the mesonic sector ( @xmath3 ) , the baryonic sector ( @xmath4 ) and the @xmath1 sector in the single comprehensive framework of a dynamically closed model with only a few ( typically  5 ) parameters",
    ". furthermore the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking part is fixed by meson masses and weak decay constants , while in turn it then reproduces the hyperon spectrum in the @xmath4 sector and will also be responsible for two hyperons forming loosely bound deuteron - like states .",
    "we now turn to some of the more salient aspects of our analysis .",
    "it is rather satisfactory to find that , apart from the known problems associated with the central attraction in the skyrme model ( see sec.[sec4 ] for further discussion of this point ) , many of the more robust predictions from the one - boson exchange approach to the problem also emerge from the skyrme model analysis . in this regard",
    "we mention that we extract unambiguously an attractive @xmath5 interaction in the @xmath6 state , a result also required from a number of complementary analyses@xcite .",
    "secondly we find e.g. an @xmath7 potential with relative components of the various spin and isospin interactions which are comparable with those found in the nijmegen potentials@xcite . as another specific example",
    ", the spin dependence of the @xmath8 potential we obtain is the same as that favoured from phenomenological and potential model estimates in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore it is possible to predict from our analysis the spin and isospin of bound deuteron type hyperon states .",
    "we also extract a rather prominent correlation of an increased binding of baryons with growing strangeness .",

    "[ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] we introduce the su(3 ) lagrangian , recall aspects of the framework in which it is typically employed and discuss our strategy of identifying a set of independent relative orientations of two skyrmions which eventually facilitates the identification of the various interaction potentials .",

    "these forces mainly reduce the one pion tail of the su(2 ) soliton to a more rapid decay corresponding to the higher meson masses present in the cloud .",
    "in order to obtain a hyperon - hyperon potential ( generally baryon - baryon potential ) we follow the standard skyrme model procedure , namely evaluate the energy of a @xmath1 configuration and subtract the energies of the two @xmath4 configurations which constitute that @xmath1 configuration . as the extremely short distance behaviour of the potentials to be calculated",

    "the occurence of the casimir operator of su(3 ) is due to a manipulation which allows us to keep the indices of the @xmath32-functions in the su(2)-subgroup : the energy density from the skyrme term @xmath17 has contributions proportional to @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the left euler angular momentum operators .",

    "since total strangeness is , of course , conserved , the baryon described by the euler angles @xmath35 must compensate for the hypercharge difference .",
    "speaking in terms of a one boson exchange description , the latter processes thus contain the kaon exchange terms .",
    "the details of the calculation of the matrix elements and the various interaction potentials are collected in appendix [ secappa ] .",
    "we must emphasize , however , that generally , we will only use wave functions diagonalizing the rigid rotator hamiltonian , because the use of a chiral angle which changes in response to the flavor symmetry breaking forces@xcite is technically too complicated , here .",
    "for testing purposes we will also use baryon wavefunctions which are su(3 ) symmetric as well as those for the strong symmetry breaking limit .",
    "unfortunately , the restriction to the rigidly rotating soliton directly leads to the fact that the asymptotic forces will always have the one - pion exchange tail , even for kaon exchange terms .",
    "this statement can be verified by examination of the asymptotic interaction , which is related to the lower order terms in the lagrangian after insertion of the equations of motion for the individual solitons . within su(2 )",
    "this has been shown by yabu and ando @xcite , and the extension to su(3 ) is straight - forward :    @xmath48    the eight asymptotic pseudoscalar soliton fields @xmath49 solving the euler lagrange equations should have the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 leading to @xmath52 however , due to the rigid rotator approximation all masses are set to @xmath53 and the asymptotic constants all equal @xmath54 for su(3)-symmetry the matrix elements of the @xmath32-functions in eq .",

    "the main emphasis of the present investigation is on the question of whether strangeness is loosely bound .",
    "accessing the problem within the framework of the skyrme model has some advantageous and some problematic aspects .",
    "the problematic aspects stem from uncertainties in the higher order terms of the lagrangian , inadequacies of the product ansatz and , ultimately , the disturbing feature that an intermediate range attraction in the nucleon - nucleon system does not emerge as simply and naturally as one might have hoped , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the obvious advantages lie in the fact that the lower order terms of the lagrangian are unambiguously fixed in the mesonic winding number zero sector .",
    "now , the same lagrangian governs the higher winding number configurations , so that conclusions based solely on the lower order terms , should also be reliable for the case of higher winding numbers .",
    "one example for this is the baryon spectrum in su(3 ) , where the lower order su(3 ) symmetry breaking in the lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ lfsb ] ) , is sufficient to describe the mass splittings , as recalled in sec .",
    "another example is given in the case of meson - baryon scattering where the use of mesonic weak decay constants and masses for this winding number one configuration is mandatory@xcite .",
    "provided that the problem of the missing intermediate range attraction finds its resolution in higher order terms and/or in improved two - baryon configurations@xcite beyond the product ansatz , we can confidently focus on the longer range part of the interaction : it does not involve the higher order terms explicitely and also the product ansatz gradually becomes exact .",
    "the longer range components of the baryon - baryon forces are due to the flavor symmetric and flavor symmetry breaking mass terms @xmath58 and @xmath40 , and the non - linear @xmath0-model term @xmath59 , see eq .",
    "( 14 ) , where the latter does not contribute at all to the central interaction .",
    "if we accept the line of reasoning above , the central interactions from the flavor and chirally symmetric terms of the lagrangian are viable to modifications , the others not .    in figs .",
    "3 - 4 we show the central interactions from the flavor symmetric part of the lagrangian for the @xmath2- , @xmath60- , @xmath61- and @xmath62-systems .",
    "the general absence of any attraction is as conspicuous as the fact , that the variation with respect to decreasing hypercharge of the system is small .",
    "this suggests , that any improvement on the central attraction in the @xmath2-system will lead to very similar attractions for the other baryons .",
    "we explore this hypothesis in figs .",
    "3 - 4 by varying the higher order stabilizing terms of the lagrangian : fig .",
    "3 shows the changes when the usual skyrme term @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ lsym ] ) , is replaced by its alternate form @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ lsym ] ) .",
    "this substitution does not lead to any changes within su(2 ) , but in su(3 ) the situation changes drastically as may be seen from the figure .",
    "since the @xmath4 solitons in the su(2)-subgroup are unaffected by variations of @xmath18 it is clear that large negative values of @xmath18 will yield arbitrary attraction for @xmath1-configurations in su(3 ) .",
    "but it seems very likely to us , that the @xmath4 soliton would not be stable towards deformations out of the su(2)-subgroup then , to which it was constrained by ansatz .",
    "we therefore refrain from such manipulations . in any case , from the mesonic sector , @xmath16 seems to be small@xcite since it violates the zweig rule .",
    "4 shows the changes , when the fourth order stabilizer is replaced by a sixth order one and when scalar degrees of freedom are taken into account . for the latter ,",
    "we choose a form inspired by , but simpler than , a local approximation to the dilatons@xcite , namely @xmath66 which effectively scales down @xmath67 in the interior of the soliton .",
    "expanding the exponential to second order gives the non - linear @xmath0-model and the usual attractive symmetric fourth order term which destabilizes the soliton , but here there are higher order terms present in the exponential to counteract this destabilization now . within su(2 ) the inclusion of dilatons was shown to lead to an intermediate range central attraction@xcite when these fields were made strong enough . in su(3 ) , however , strong dilaton fields lead to a problem since not only @xmath67 is scaled down in the interior but also all mass terms resulting in too small hyperon splittings in the @xmath4 sector@xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the rationale of all these different higher order terms is not only to investigate further mechanisms for an intermediate range attraction , but also to demonstrate that the central interaction from the flavor symmetric terms is fairly independent of the hypercharge of the two - baryon configuration .",
    "if the @xmath2-system acquires it s intermediate range attraction from the flavor symmetric terms , this attraction will also be present for the hyperons .",
    "it remains to be said , that the interactions in figs .",
    "3 - 4 have all been determined with baryon wavefunctions diagonalizing the rotational motion in the presence of su(3 ) symmetry breaking , see eq .",
    "the distortions in the baryon wavefunctions away from su(3 ) , however , do not play a decisive role here , which means , that su(3 ) symmetric wavefunctions or wavefunctions in the strong symmetry breaking limit always lead to very small variations of the flavor symmetric central interaction with respect to hypercharge .",
    "5 shows the central interactions for identical baryons as they arise from those terms , which explicitly break the flavor symmetry .",
    "these contributions arise solely from the euler angle matrix elements of @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) and are directly proportional to the product of the strangeness contents of the two interacting baryons , since @xmath69 . from fig .   5 we see that @xmath70 is attractive and large , such that binding is enhanced with growing strangeness content . since this additional binding comes from a term fixed in the mesonic sector , we judge this to be a reliable conclusion , which also summarises one of the main points of the present work .    in appendix [ secappb ]",
    "we give a complete list of all interaction components for @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath71 , @xmath5 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 systems using only the normal skyrme term , @xmath17 , as stabilizer adjusting the @xmath74-splitting .",
    "again , the longer - range spin - isospin dependence is due to terms fixed in the mesonic sector and thus insensitive to any reasonable modifications of the lagrangian . for",
    "the @xmath2-case we exploit one of the advantages of our approach to the su(3)-interactions , namely that we are able to switch continuously from su(3)-symmetry to the su(2)-limit by simply changing the baryon wavefunctions , see eq .",
    "( a1 ) . comparing these cases for the @xmath2-interaction",
    ", we find that there is a smooth transition with small changes in the longer range parts of the interaction to the well known results in su(2 ) .",
    "this finding apparently is in contrast to other work published recently on the baryon - baryon interactions in the su(3 ) skyrme model@xcite and similar discrepancies persist for other baryon pairs , too , which could be@xcite due to difficulties in the monte carlo integrations used in ref.@xcite .    from the fact that two nucleons are loosely bound and well separated in an isospin @xmath75 , spin @xmath76 state ( the deuteron ) , and",
    "that no additional repulsion arises in the longer - range central interactions when hypercharge is decreased , we are able to predict the spin and isospin of bound deuteron - like states of hyperons . to this end",
    "we just have to examine the sign of the different spin - isospin components of the long - range interaction , which , as already has been stated , is due to well established terms in the lagrangian .",
    "explicitly ( see appendix [ secappb ] ) we find that an @xmath8-pair should be bound in a ( @xmath77)-state , an @xmath7-pair in a ( @xmath77)-state , an @xmath71-pair in a ( @xmath78)-state , a @xmath5-pair in a ( @xmath78)-state , a @xmath72-pair in a ( @xmath79)-state , and a @xmath73-pair in a ( @xmath80)-state .    in su(2 )",
    "the most attractive configuration , the torus , can be found numerically by initializing a general minimization algorithm with the most attractive product configuration@xcite .",
    "this most attractive product configuration occurs at a relative orientation of @xmath81 for the two hedgehogs . with the tools set up for the present investigation we are in a position to determine the most attractive product configuration in su(3 ) by minimizing the flavor symmetric part of the interaction energy , eq .",
    "( 7 ) with respect to the 8 euler angles in @xmath23 at all separations .",
    "interestingly , the most attractive orientation is unchanged , i.e. it resides in the su(2 ) subgroup , hinting that the torus will also be the minimum in the @xmath1-sector of su(3 ) . in case of flavor symmetry with all meson masses equal to the pion mass",
    "the torus is known@xcite to be lower in energy than the so(3)-soliton found by balachandran _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "in the present work we have explored to which extent it is possible to make reliable statements about whether hyperons form bound deuteron like states . to this end we have used the su(3 ) skyrme model and compared the @xmath2-interaction in the product ansatz to different @xmath82- and @xmath83-interactions which emerge from the same ansatz .",
    "( @xmath84 represents any octet baryon with non - zero strangeness . ) for loosely bound deuteron like configurations",
    "the product ansatz is sufficient if the only purpose is the investigation of whether there is more binding in the @xmath82-system relative to the @xmath2-case in the longer range part of the interaction .",
    "such a comparison within the skyrme model unfortunately also meets two other obstructions : the well - known problem of the missing intermediate range central attraction and the incomplete knowledge on the correct combination of higher order stabilizing terms .",
    "the latter statement , of course , reflects the belief that the lower order terms are fixed by their empirical values in the mesonic sector for which evidence has been given in several places@xcite .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the higher order stabilizers , which exclusively make up the chiral and flavor symmetric contributions to the central interaction , show little variation with respect to different baryon pairs considered .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties associated with these terms are eliminated when we look at differences between @xmath2- @xmath82- and @xmath83-interactions : if some combination of higher order terms  most likely a coupling to scalar degrees of freedom  leads to a central attraction in the @xmath2-case , it will also do so for the other cases .",
    "there remain the longer range contributions from the known lower order terms : the non - linear @xmath0-model is responsible for the spin and flavor dependent components of the interaction , whereas the chiral and flavor symmetry breaking terms introduce further central interactions which become increasingly attractive as the strangeness contents of the participating baryons grow .",
    "the conclusion , that hyperons must be bound in deuteron like states , therefore seems inescapable .",
    "although our findings confirm or extend what is commonly expected , we think that we actually have added some weight to such expectations .",
    "since the contribution of the non - linear @xmath0-model to the potential is also considered a reliable quantity here , we were actually in a position to predict the spins and isospins of the most attractive baryon - baryon configurations .",
