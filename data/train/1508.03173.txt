    "in this paper i will derive a combinatorial formula for the partition function .",
    "i discovered this formula by investigating a tree of the partition function .",
    "it appears that the set of all partitions is not homogeneous and different partitions belong to different levels .",
    "the formula that will be discussed in this paper has also been discovered by andrew sills@xcite from georgia southern university . in his paper professor",
    "sills uses durfee squares to prove the formula . in my work , as i have mentioned above , i derive the formula from the tree structure of the partition function .",
    "i learned about work of professor sills accidentally , after my colleague francesco sica had written a letter to george andrews for the quick assessment of the formula .",
    "professor andrews , in turn , forwarded this letter to andrew sills , who sent me his own article and suggested me to think about open questions which he posted in his article .",
    "i believe that my approach is different from his and uses another combinatorial methods .    in the second part of the paper",
    "i establish connection between partitions and q - binomial coefficients and give new combinatorial meaning for the q - binomial coefficients .",
    "partition function @xmath0 is the number of ways of writing integer @xmath1 as a sum of positive integers , where the order of addends is not important .",
    "for example , since    @xmath2    @xmath3 . by convention",
    "@xmath4 when @xmath5 and @xmath6 when @xmath7 .",
    "it is very hard to compute @xmath0 for big @xmath1 by simply writing down all partitions of @xmath1 .",
    "the table below shows values of @xmath0 for different @xmath1 s .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     looking at the table one may notice that center simmetric partitions are conjugate to each other .",
    "this fact can be generalized as follows : partitions corresponding to @xmath8 in @xmath9 are conjugate to the partitions corresponding to @xmath8 in @xmath10 .",
    "remember that    @xmath11    at the same time    @xmath12    putting these two facts together we get    @xmath13    for @xmath14 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand ,    @xmath16    and    @xmath17    therefore ,    @xmath18",
    "partition function plays very important role in many areas of mathematics . for example :    1 .   @xmath0 counts the number of conjugacy classes in the symmetric group @xmath19 , which is at the same time the number of irreducible representations of @xmath19 .",
    "2 .   number of distinct abelian groups of order @xmath20 equals to @xmath0 .",
