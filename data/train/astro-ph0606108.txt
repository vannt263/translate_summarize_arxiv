    "the trihydrogen ion , h@xmath0 , is supposed to become the principal carrier of positive charge in the centres of cold , dense cores when heavy elements like c , o and n , are nearly completely depleted ( @xcite ) .",
    "because deuterium fractionation reactions are favoured in cold gas , relatively large abundances of the isotopoloques h@xmath1d@xmath2 and d@xmath1h@xmath2 are to be expected in these objects .",
    "this has been also confirmed by observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while infrared absorption spectroscopy of h@xmath0 can be used to extract vital information on the gas columns towards infrared sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , the rotational lines of h@xmath1d@xmath2 and d@xmath1h@xmath2 probe the physical conditions of cold , prestellar cores .",
    "the abundance of h@xmath0 and its deuterated forms depend on the cosmic ray ionization rate of h@xmath1 , and on the abundances of destructing agents : electrons , gaseous neutral species like co and n@xmath1 , and negatively charged grains ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furhermore , the h@xmath0 abundance and the h@xmath1d@xmath2/h@xmath0 abundance ratio depend heavily on the _ ortho : para _ ratio of h@xmath1 , which in turn is a function of time and density ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ground - state @xmath3 transition of _",
    "ortho_-h@xmath1d@xmath2 lies between adjacent atmospheric o@xmath1 and h@xmath1o absorption lines and its observation requires extremely good conditions .",
    "a reasonable limit is that the precipitable water vapour content of the atmosphere , pwv , is less than 0.5 mm , which can be achieved at high - altitude observatories only .",
    "h@xmath1d@xmath2 has been previously detected from mauna kea towards a protostellar core ( @xcite ) , and in a small number of prestellar dark cloud cores ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report on the first h@xmath1d@xmath2 observations with the atacama pathfinder experiment , apex , during its science verification periods in july , october and november 2005 .",
    "the main goal of this series of observations was to test the feasibility of the 372 ghz line observations with this instrument .",
    "in the course of these measurements h@xmath1d@xmath2 was detected in a core belonging to a high - mass star forming region .",
    "this may open new vistas to the chemical evolution preceding the collapse of massive stars .",
    "the selection of targets contains five starless cores of molecular clouds and one massive , cold core which encloses a low - luminosity far - infrared source .",
    "the massive , cold core * orib9 * embedding iras 05405 - 0117 in the region of orion b is described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the average ammonia linewidth is only @xmath8 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the core does not stand out on the @xmath10co and c@xmath11o maps of @xcite , probably because of co depletion . in this survey",
    "we have included the three n@xmath1h@xmath12 peaks found by @xcite .",
    "these are likely to pinpoint separate clumps within the core .",
    "the clump associated with the iras source is likely to represent an early stage of collapse at which newly born stars have not yet disturbed their surroundings .",
    "the subsidiary clumps ( orib9 e and n ) may be in a still earlier , pre - collapse phase . depending on the time spent in the pre - collapse phase , chemical evolution may have resulted in a high degree of depletion and an increased h@xmath1d@xmath2 abundance .",
    "the two positions observed towards the nearby , starless dark cloud * l183 * ( l134n ) ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) correspond to the @xmath13 m continuum peaks in the scuba map of @xcite .",
    "the southern maximum ( l183-s , the @xmath14 m emission peak ) can be assigned to a very cold , dense core with a high degree of molecular depletion .",
    "the two sources may represent different evolutionary stages of prestellar cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare their chemical and dynamical properties .",
    "after perfoming these observations we learned that the h@xmath1d@xmath2 has been detected at several positions along the dense ridge of l183 with the cso by @xcite .",
    "the starless , dense clump * r cra nw * in the northwestern part of the r coronae australis cloud lies close to the 1.2 mm continuum source `` mms10 '' ( @xcite ) .",

    "we estimate from the n@xmath1h@xmath12 data of @xcite that the n@xmath1h@xmath2 column density towards iras 05405 - 0117 is @xmath22  @xmath23 .",
    "the intensity of the supposed n@xmath1h@xmath20 line is consistent with this value .",

    "were made at low elevations .",
    "furthermore , the system temperature was higher than expected from the observing conditions , probably because of problems with the integration of the asc correlator into the system .",
    "the observed h@xmath1d@xmath2 line has quadrupole hyperfine structure due to the spins of d and the two h nuclei .",
    "the splitting is , however , very small ( @xmath24  khz , @xcite ) compared with the doppler width at 10 k ( @xmath25  khz ) , and we treat the line as if it had a single component .",
    "we estimate the _ ortho_-h@xmath1d@xmath2 column densities , @xmath26 , in the same manner as done in @xcite .",
    "a lower limit for the excitation temperature , @xmath27 , is obtained from the observed @xmath28 by assuming that the line is optically thick .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the gas , @xmath29 , sets an upper limit .    towards l183-s ( 0,0 ) ,",
    "the reasonable @xmath27 range is @xmath30 ( allowing @xmath29 be slightly higher than the dust temperature ) . assuming that @xmath31  k , and that the source fills the main beam uniformly , we arrive at the values @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xmath23 .",

    "the peak h@xmath1 column density towards l183-s derived from scuba data is @xmath35  @xmath23 ( kirk & ward - thompson , 2006 , private communication ) . using this value",

    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 decrease ( higher @xmath27 , smaller @xmath39 ) or increase ( lower @xmath27 , larger @xmath39 ) by a factor of three",
    ". the line shape does not support , however , the idea of large opacities , and we think the values corresponding to @xmath40  k are the most likely .",
    "orib9 is little studied and dust continuum measurements are not available .",
    "the @xmath29 derived from ammonia is 10  k , and the minimum @xmath27 from the line intensity is 4  k. using the assumption @xmath41  k , which is midway between the two extremes , we get @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath23 towards n and e. the ammonia column density in these positions is @xmath44  @xmath23 . assuming that the fractional nh@xmath17 abundance is @xmath45 ( e.g. @xcite ) we get @xmath46",
    ". the line profiles with rather poor s / n ratios do not exclude large optical thicknesses .",
    "the column density range implied by the possible @xmath27 values is @xmath47 @xmath23 , and the derived fractional abundance has the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "according to the model of @xcite , the characteristic steady - state value of the _ o / p_-ratio of h@xmath1d@xmath2 is @xmath48 in the density range @xmath49  @xmath50 appropriate for the objects of this study . adopting this _",
    "o / p_-ratio the total h@xmath1d@xmath2 abundances in l183-s and orib9 become @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the performance of apex and its equipment , and the atmospheric transmission on chajnantor are found to meet very high standards .",
    "the telescope is therefore likely to become a very important tool for studies of molecular cloud interiors and star formation using h@xmath1d@xmath2 , and other difficult molecules .",
    "the present observations towards a small sample of dense cores with some diversity of physical characteristics suggest that either an elevated temperature ( as in r cra nw ) or the presence of an embedded star ( as towards iras 05405 - 0117 ) , even if there is little evidence for star - cloud interaction , decreases the changes to find h@xmath1d@xmath2 .",
    "the kinetic temperature , velocity dispersion and the fractional h@xmath1d@xmath2 abundance in orib9 are similar to those in the prestellar dark cloud cores l1544 , 16293e , and l183 , where strong emission of this line has been detected previously .",
    "the masses and the central densities of these nearby cores are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the total mass of the orib9 core estimated from ammonia is of the order of @xmath55 ( @xcite ) , and the subcondensations seen in the n@xmath1h@xmath2 map ( @xcite ) are likely to be an order of magnitude more massive than l1544 , 16293e , or l183 .",
    "a ( sub)millimetre continuum map is needed to confirm this .",
    "nevertheless , orib9 seems to be capable of forming a massive star or a dense cluster of low- to intermediate - mass stars , and is therefore exceptional among sources detected in h@xmath1d@xmath2 so far .",
    "this detection confirms the existence of very cold , quiescent , dense cores in massive star forming regions .",
    "the previous evidence for such objects is scarce",
    ". some infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) have gas temperatures approaching 10  k and ammonia linewidths slightly below 1 kms@xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "yet another massive core with these characteristics has been recently found in the region of isoss j18364 - 0221 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the linewidths in these objects are , however , clearly larger than in orib9 . on the other hand ,",
    "only a small fraction of irdcs have been observed in spectral lines to date . because compression leads to an intensified cooling by molecules and dust ,",
    "the collapse of all dense cores should be preceded by a cold , quiescent phase .",
    "very cold gmc cores may have remained indiscernible because of their short life - time or the fact that large - scale surveys are usually biased towards the presence of a certain molecular species which might be depleted in the coldest regions .    as discussed recently by @xcite ,",
    "the h@xmath1d@xmath2 abundance depends inversely on the _ ortho_:_para _ ratio of h@xmath1 , which is largest at early stages of core evolution .",
    "consequently , a high degree of deuterium fractionation is a sign of matured chemistry characterized by a low _ o_/_p _ h@xmath1 and probably a high degree of molecular depletion .",
    "ortho_-h@xmath1d@xmath2 detection towards orib9 suggests an evolved chemical stage and tells of a longlasting prestellar phase .",
    "however , estimates of the _ o_/_p _ ratio of h@xmath1 and the degree of deuterium fractionation using other tracers are needed to confirm this . despite these obstacles , it seems viable to use the 372 ghz h@xmath1d@xmath2 line together with chemistry models to estimate timescales related to the early evolution of massive cores .",
