    "pulsars are normally modelled as rapidly rotating , highly magnetized stars composed mainly of neutrons .",
    "it has been observed that their rotation frequencies are decaying , this spin - down being quantified by the braking index ( bi ) , @xmath0 , defined by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the pulsar s angular velocity and the dot denotes a time derivative . in such model , which we will refer to as canonical , the main time - varying field responsible for the loss of rotational energy in a pulsar is a magnetic dipole field @xcite . also , the canonical model predicts n=3 for all existing pulsars .",
    "there are not many pulsars for which the bi was obtained observationally ( see table [ tab : pulsars ] ) .",
    "most of their bi values lie within the range @xmath3 ( see table [ tab : bcomplete ] ) .",
    "the only pulsar with index greater than three is j1640 - 4631 , whose value , @xmath4 , was recently measured@xcite .",
    "since the canonical model fails to yield the observed bi , improvements on this model have been tried involving different theoretical approaches @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our predicted bi values for j1418 - 6058 and 1e 1547.0 - 5408 ( also known as j1550 - 5418 ) are in agreement with the predictions by @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tab : morepulsars ] the numbers for pulsar j1124 - 5916 are close to those for j1640 - 4631 , including our predicted bi .",
    "the value @xmath5 is the largest that our model can provide . since the latter pulsar has @xmath6 ,",
    "we wonder if the former would have @xmath7 as well . as a generalization , perhaps pulsars that have bi close to 2.95 in our model might have @xmath8.this suggests that our model may be able to indicate pulsars with bi larger than three even though it was developed for pulsars with indices less than three .    , versus the effective force proportionality constant , @xmath9 , for the pulsars listed in table [",
    "tab : bcomplete ] .",
    "the symbols are located at the values of @xmath9 obtained from the model trough equation ( [ eq : bcomplete ] ) using the observational values of @xmath0 presented in table [ tab : bcomplete ] .",
    "that equation also provides the lines for each pulsar .",
    "the line made of small diamonds corresponds to the fitted function in equation ( [ eq : nbfit ] ) .",
    "the intersecion between this line and that of each individual pulsar is close to the respective symbol . ]",
    "we analysed a modification of the canonical model for pulsars spin - down that introduces an effective force that is tangential to the star s rotation motion .",
    "our goal was to provide more precise predictions of pulsars bi .",
    "the effective force involves all yet unknown physical contributions that make pulsars bi less than three .",
    "our results were possible assuming that the pulsars have the same ( typical ) values for some physical characteristics , like mass and radius .",
    "we used eight pulsars with observed bi to calibrate the model . also , we discovered an extra relation between the bi , the ratio @xmath10 and the tangential force constant of a pulsar which enabled us to make predictions of bi of other pulsars .    the results that we found are applicable to pulsars with @xmath11 larger than 10@xmath12 rad s@xmath13 and with @xmath10 near the range 1 - 25 @xmath14 10@xmath15 s@xmath16 . in order to improve the model , it is important to find physical details about the effective force .",
    "its mathematical structure is simple and general , allowing different physical possibilities for its origin .",
