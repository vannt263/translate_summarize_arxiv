    "the evolution of galaxies involves the birth and death of stars , therefore , galaxies unavoidably produce metals as they live .",
    "thus , galaxies with very low metallic content are probably unevolved objects , and if we find them nearby , they provide a readily accessible fossil record from the early universe .",
    "these objects are to be expected according to the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation , where large galaxies arise through the assembly of smaller ones in an inefficient process leaving many dwarf galaxies as remnant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they seem to be materialized as the extremely metal - poor ( xmp ) dwarf galaxies observed today which , consequently , would be the closest examples we can find of these elementary primordial units from which larger galaxies assembled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "those units must have been extremely common in the past , but they can not be directly observed at high redshift .",
    "nearby low metallicity galaxies offer a chance for detailed studies otherwise impossible . studies of their interstellar medium ( ism ) can shed light on the properties of the primordial ism at the time of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "for example , even the most metal - deficient galaxies in the local universe formed from matter already enriched by an early star formation episode , and the determination of the minimum galactic metallicity seems to be the best constraint available on these first stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because they have not undergone much chemical evolution , these galaxies are also the best objects for the determination of the primordial he abundance that constrains cosmological models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the class of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contains the galaxies with the lowest known gas - phase metallicity .",
    "it is so far unclear whether such preference for xmp galaxies to be bcds is genuine or if the association results from an observational bias that systematically disfavors low surface brightness objects .",
    "the best xmp candidates in the local universe are bcds , but metal poor galaxies are found among other types of dwarf galaxies as well ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    unfortunately , xmp galaxies are rare .",
    "the review by @xcite cites only 31 targets with metallicity below one tenth the solar value , which is the threshold customary used to define xmp galaxies . for decades izw18 held the record of lowest metallicity @xcite , and although a few other examples have been recently found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is a minimum metallicity close to that of i  zw  18 , which corresponds to a few hundredths the solar value .",
    "the existence of such metallicity threshold is suggestive of the pre - galactic origin of metals as it happens with halo stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it may also be due to other effects like the early self contamination of the ongoing starburst that rises any original level to a minimum metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even the technical difficulty of metallicity determinations below a threshold . the number of low metallicity galaxies has significantly increased since the work by @xcite , but they are still rare objects .",
    "the thorough bibliographic compilation described in   [ biblio_search ] shows only 129 such targets .",
    "the shortage of low metallicity galaxies is partly a consequence of their low luminosity as expected from the luminosity - metallicity relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". they must be faint and so detectable only within a very local volume .    in order to enlarge the list of this rare yet interesting objects , we have carried out an automatic search for low metallicity galaxies in the seventh sloan digital sky survey data release ( sdss / dr7 ) .",
    "the work is reported here . so far as we are aware of",
    ", this is the first systematic search of this kind on sdss / dr7 , even though extensive searches in earlier sdss data releases have been reported .",
    "the advantage of an orderly search rather than the more traditional serendipitous discovery is twofold .",
    "first , it maximizes the number of potential candidates .",
    "second , the bias of the selection is quantifiable , allowing us to estimate for the first time the volume number density of xmp galaxies in the local universe .",
    "low metallicity galaxies are characterized by having a [ nii]@xmath56583 line negligibly small as compared to h@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the ratio between [ nii]@xmath56583 and h@xmath0 is used to measure metallicities through the appropriate calibration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a low value of this ratio has been imposed as a necessary condition in classical works seeking for xmp galaxies .",
    "building on this classical approach , we address the problem in an original way by automatically classifying the galaxies according to the shape of their spectra in a region around h@xmath0 .",
    "we expected the classification to automatically separate classes of galaxies whose spectra present this property , and those targets would be regarded as metal poor candidates .",
    "note that our approach does not require the detailed knowledge of the spectral properties of the xmp galaxies , e.g. , we do not have to specify a particular ratio [ nii]@xmath56583 over h@xmath0 for a galaxy to be included .",
    "they are determined by the classification algorithm in view of the existing spectra .",
    "this minimum need of prior knowledge makes the search novel and robust against uncertainties in the selection criteria .",
    "the above conjecture turned out to work , and the result of the study is presented here .",
    "we employ a robust classification algorithm called _ k - means _ ,",
    "commonly used in data - mining ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which we have already successfully applied to sort out different types of astronomical spectra spanning from polarization profiles in the sun to galaxy spectra @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe the systematic search for low metallicity galaxies (   [ kmeans ] ) .",
    "sdss / dr7 renders 32 xmp candidates .",
    "the physical properties of the galaxies thus selected are analyzed in   [ properties ] .",
    "these candidates , together with the rest of sdss / dr7 galaxies , allow us to compute the volume number density of low metallicity galaxies in the local universe (   [ number_density ] ) . in order to contextualize our work",
    ", we carried out a comprehensive search for xmp in the literature .",
    "the results are given in ",
    "[ biblio_search ] . a summary with conclusions and",
    "follow up work is provided in   [ conclusions ] .",
    "as we mention in the introduction , the spectrum around h@xmath0 is very sensitive to metallicity .",
    "the ratio between the equivalent widths of [ nii]@xmath56583 and h@xmath0 goes to zero with decreasing metallicity , as calibrated by , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we make use of this sensitivity to select low metallicity galaxies classifying all the galaxies with spectra in sdss / dr7 according to their shape around h@xmath0 . those classes containing spectra where [ nii]@xmath56583 turns out to be negligible small with respect to h@xmath0 will be saved as candidates . for detailed information on the sdss spectral catalog , see @xcite , @xcite , as well as the comprehensive sdss / dr7 web site .",
    "the main properties of the catalog affecting our analysis are the spectral resolution of the spectra , some @xmath6 at h@xmath0 , and the fact that it includes all galaxies up to an integrated @xmath7 magnitude of @xmath8 .    since the classification must be based on the shape of the spectrum rather that on other incidental property ( e.g. , the galaxy luminosity ) , the spectra must go through a previous normalization procedure .",
    "the original spectra are shifted to restframe wavelength using sdss redshifts , and then normalized to the flux in the @xmath9 color filter .",
    "in addition , the continuum around h@xmath0 is subtracted , and this spectrum is re - normalized to the peak intensity of [ nii]@xmath56583 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath10 stands for the spectrum in restframe wavelengths and normalized to @xmath9 , then the spectrum to be classified is @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath5 stands for the wavelength , and @xmath13 is the intensity at the extreme of [ nii]@xmath56583 , i.e. , the maximum if the line is in emission and the minimum if it is in absorption .",
    "the continuum intensity @xmath14 is derived by linear interpolation of the spectrum in two clean windows at both sides of the spectral region of interest , namely , from 6400  to 6460 , and from 6610  to 6670 .",
    "note that the denominator of equation  ( [ def1 ] ) is always positive so that the lines in absorption remain in absorption after normalization .",
    "we came across this normalization after some alternative trials .",
    "the normalization to [ nii]@xmath56583 turns out to maximize the contrast since it goes to zero for the low metallicity galaxies we are trying to identify .",
    "figure  [ normalization ] summarizes the normalization procedure .",
    "it includes the original spectrum ( the black solid line ) as well as the two continuum windows used to determine the continuum intensity .",
    "after normalization ( i.e. , after continuum removal plus division by the maximum intensity at [ nii]@xmath56583 ) it becomes the dashed line , which is the 80  wide spectral range undergoing classification .",
    "@xmath56583 small compared to the nearby h@xmath0 line . the original spectrum ( the black solid line )",
    "is normalized before classification rendering the ( red ) dashed line .",
    "the normalization includes removing the continuum , and dividing the residual by the maximum intensity of [ nii]@xmath56583 .",
    "the blue solid bars at the extremes mark the intervals used to determine the continuum .",
    "the central 80  wide bar embraces the spectral region of interest .",
    "wavelengths @xmath5 are in  , and the spectra are given in arbitrary units .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we employ the algorithm k - means for classification .",
    "it treats the spectra as vectors in a @xmath15-dimensional space , with @xmath15 the number of wavelengths .",
    "it is a rather standard technique in data - mining , machine learning , and artificial intelligence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we have already successfully employed it for massive classification of galaxy spectra @xcite .",
    "it works iteratively , starting from randomly chosen cluster centers .",
    "each galaxy spectrum is assigned to the cluster center that is closest in a least - squares sense .",
    "then the cluster centers are recomputed as the average spectrum of all the spectra in the class , and the assignation begins again .",
    "the algorithm ends when no spectra are re - classified in two successive iterations .",
    "the main advantages are : ( 1 ) it is fast , simple , and robust , as requited to classify large data sets , ( 2 ) it guarantees that similar spectra end up in the same class , ( 3 ) it automatically yields the number of classes , and ( 4 ) it provides spectra that are characteristic of the classes .",
    "these template spectra are just the average of all the spectra in the class , and they can be analyzed and interpreted as individual galaxies under the same assumptions followed when applying the popular _ stacking _ technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the drawbacks are : ( 1 ) the starting random seeds influence the classification , and such effect must be followed up and , eventually , corrected for , and ( 2 ) the classes do not necessarily represent individual clusters in the classification space , but may be parts of clusters .",
    "the latter downside is not a problem in our particular application since we are not interested in clustering but in separating spectra with different shapes . as for the former ,",
    "one have to carry out several independent trials to test the robustness of the classes on the initialization .",
    "we apply k - means to the galaxies with spectra having redshift @xmath16 , which is equivalent to classifying all the @xmath17 galaxies with spectra in sdss / dr7 since the low metallicity targets are expected to be faint (   [ intro ] ) and , consequently they can not be observed at high redshift given the apparent magnitude threshold imposed by sdss .",
    "( for a galaxy at redshift @xmath18 0.25 to be observed spectroscopically , the absolute @xmath7 magnitude must be smaller than @xmath19 . )",
    "the k - means procedure is applied in two successive steps , because a single application renders classes too coarse to separate low metallicity galaxies . in the first application ,",
    "we remove classes having h@xmath0 in absorption , as well as those whose [ nii]@xmath56583 is much too large . actually the limit is not imposed directly on [ nii]@xmath56583 , but on the equivalent oxygen abundance deduced via the so - called n2-method which depends , exclusively , on the ratio between the equivalent widths of [ nii]@xmath56583 and h@xmath0 , @xmath20\\lambda6583}\\big / w_{\\rm h\\alpha}\\big ) .",

    "the subset undergoing the second classification contains some 5000 galaxies , which correspond to only 0.6% of the original set .",

    "one of the advantages of carrying out a systematic search in sdss / dr7 is starting from a magnitude limited sample .",

    "however , we can not discard the existence of missing targets (   [ biblio_search ] ) and , if so , the figures we provide have to be scaled up accordingly .",
    "although it is difficult to tell how much , we will try to make an educated guess .",
    "about sixty known xmp galaxies in the sdss field of view have not been included in our selection ( see fig .",

    "they may have been excluded for several reasons  because they are too faint , because noise in the spectra artificially enhances [ nii]@xmath56583 with respect to h@xmath0 , because [ nii]@xmath56583 exceeds the limits of our selection , and possibly others .",

    "obviously , the almost one million spectra in the database can not be inspected individually , and we resort to the use of a standard automatic method of classification : k - means . after two nested runs of the procedure , and a subsequent cleaning up for artifacts created by the sdss pipeline",

    "are formed by chains of knots .",
    "already noticed the trend for xmp bcds to reveal a cometary morphology due to the presence of intense star formation at one edge that gradually decreases .",
    "this shape is not unique to xmp galaxies , but it comprises only 10% of all bcds @xcite , whereas it is dominant when they are metal poor .",
    "the origin of the xmp shapes is also unclear .",
    "there are arguments for gravitational triggering due to mergers with low - mass stellar or gaseous companions , or for the self propagation of star formation activity within a pre - existing gas rich galaxy .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite have found that all xmp galaxies have distorted hi morphologies , which may indicate the infall of external unenriched gas feeding the starburst and dropping the metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". it may also be the signature of gas stripping forced by the interaction with an external medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "a concluding remark is in order .",
    "the methods for mining massive astronomical databases are still under development .",
    "the bases are simply too large for the traditional techniques to be efficient . in this sense",
    ", the current paper presents a new approach that may be of interest beyond our particular application . the standard method to find xmp galaxies ( or galaxies with any other property )",
    "would have been to set , beforehand , the observational criteria the targets should fulfill . then those targets complying with the criteria would have been selected .",
