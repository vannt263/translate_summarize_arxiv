    "the study of the dynamics of an ordered medium driven by an external force through quenched impurities is relevant to many physical systems .",
    "examples include charge - density waves ( cdws ) in anisotropic metals@xcite and flux - line lattices ( fll ) in the mixed state of type - ii superconductors@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that in both these systems impurities destroy the equilibrium long - range translational order ( lrto ) and pin the medium .",
    "a driving force @xmath3 , originating from an electric field or a current , can overcome the constraining forces from the impurities and cause the medium to slide . at @xmath4 , classical cdws exhibit",
    "a depinning transition at a critical driving force @xmath5 from a pinned ( @xmath6 ) to a sliding ( @xmath7 ) state .",
    "this transition has been described as a dynamic critical phenomenon .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics of the system near the critical point has been studied extensively both by numerical simulation@xcite and by @xmath8 expansions@xcite and is fairly well understood .    in contrast , the dynamics of driven disordered media at large driving force , well above the depinning transition , has only recently begun to receive some attention . in the sliding state the pinning by impurities is less effective and it has been suggested that the medium may recover the lrto at sufficiently large velocity .",
    "recent experiments in ybco as well as simulations of two - dimensional flux lattices have indeed shown that the flux array orders at large drives .",
    "koshelev and vinokur @xcite have described this phenomenon as a true phase transition from a flowing liquid to a moving solid . whether the ordering of driven flux lattices is a true dynamical phase transition or a crossover is still an open question .",
    "some of us recently addressed this class of questions by focusing on a model of driven cdws in the presence of disorder and thermal noise@xcite .",
    "the model considered in ref.@xciteallows for disorder - induced phase slips of the cdw . in three dimensions it yields a dynamical phase transition of the sliding cdw from a disordered phase with plastic flow to a temporally periodic `` moving solid '' phase with quasi - long - range translational order . in two dimensions the moving solid phase is unstable due to the proliferation of phase slips .    in the present paper we focus on a related model of the dynamics of sliding cdws that incorporates a nonequilibrium nonlinear term of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) form@xcite , that was neglected in ref.@xcite . to render the analysis tractable with this addition , we have , however , neglected phase slips , and , for most of what follows , thermal fluctuations .",
    "while the neglect of thermal noise has very little effect upon our results , the omission of phase slips appears more severe .",
    "indeed , the model considered here is by definition an elastic continuum at all driving forces and a `` liquid phase '' with dislocations can not occur .",
    "we expect that at sufficiently low temperature and large driving force the omitted defects will make only minor changes to our results , at least on experimentally observable time scales .",
    "the true ( infinite time ) asymptotics is , however , likely to be affected by this omission .",
    "interestingly , despite its strong topological constraints , our model nevertheless exhibits a phase transition at a critical driving force @xmath0 from an isotropic rough ( disorder dominated ) flowing phase at small driving forces , to an anisotropic smooth flowing phase where nonlinearities are washed out by the external drive .",
    "the average cdw velocity changes sharply at the transition , which is argued to be first order .",
    "the two phases are characterized by different values of the roughening exponent governing the growth of spatial fluctuations of the cdw phase with the size @xmath9 of the system in the direction of the external drive ( @xmath10direction ) . in the rough phase",
    "the phase fluctuations grow linearly with @xmath9 , @xmath11 , indicating that the elastic model breaks down .",
    "this suggests that in a corresponding model that allows for phase slips , this phase would be a flowing liquid . above @xmath0 the disorder",
    "is washed out in the direction of motion .",
    "fluctuations are strongly suppressed in this direction and @xmath12 for @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "our results have two implications for cdw experiments at high velocities , provided phase slip effects are sufficiently suppressed at low temperatures .",
    "first , above the critical force ( @xmath15 ) , translational correlations are expected to be highly anisotropic , decaying much more rapidly transverse to the motion than along it .",
    "this implies a substantial increase in the ratio of widths of bragg scattering peaks , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are peak widths perpendicular and parallel to the cdw wave vector , respectively .",
    "secondly , within our model , the non - equilibrium ordering transition is characterized by a jump discontinuity in the differential conductance @xmath19 .",
    "as discussed in further detail in the next section , we are able to predict only the singular behavior of @xmath20 , and not the full non - linear form of the @xmath21 curve .",
    "we expect these two results to survive in varying degrees in models including phase slips ( and hence experiments ) .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the translational correlations in the high - velocity phase should remain at low temperatures .",
    "the resistance singularity is expected to be more sensitive to phase slips ( as , indeed , is the entire small @xmath3 phase ) .",
    "their effects are expected to round the step in @xmath20 very near to @xmath0 .",
    "charge - density waves are coupled electron - phonon excitations which exist in a class of anisotropic metals consisting of weakly coupled chains . in these materials the electronic density is sinusoidally modulated along the chain @xmath22 direction , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the in - chain fermi wave vector and @xmath25 the amplitude of the charge modulation . at low temperature , due to the gap in the dispersion relation for the amplitude ,",
    "amplitude fluctuations are strongly suppressed and the dynamics can be described in terms of the phase @xmath26 only .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 for a cdw in a @xmath28dimensional metal can be written as @xcite @xmath29   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int d\\bfr v({\\bf r})\\rho_1\\cos(2k_fx+\\phi({\\bfr},t ) ) ,   \\label{cdwh2d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have rescaled coordinates to obtain an isotropic elastic term .",
    "the coefficient @xmath30 is a stiffness constant .",
    "the effect of impurities is described via a gaussian random potential @xmath31 with zero mean , @xmath32 , and short range correlations , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 a short wavelength cutoff .",
    "the overdamped equation of motion for the cdw phase variable @xmath26 is given by@xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 has the dimension of a diffusion constant @xmath37 . here @xmath38 is the relaxation time of a thermally excited phonon , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the electronic mass and effective mass , respectively .",
    "we have also let @xmath41 . the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ flreom ] ) arises from an electric field @xmath42 applied along the @xmath10direction , with @xmath43 , and can be shifted away by @xmath44 .",

    "equation ( [ flreom ] ) is the conventional fukuyama - lee - rice ( flr ) model of cdw dynamics@xcite , which has been studied extensively both analytically and numerically , particularly near the depinning transition .",
    "the flr model exhibits a depinning transition at a threshold field @xmath49 , corresponding to a threshold force @xmath50 .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , the flr equation is incomplete in the strongly driven regime .",
    "it is essentially a near - equilibrium description , in which only the most relevant perturbation ( the driving field ) has been added to the equilibrium relaxational dynamics .",
    "several additional effects become important in the sliding state .",
    "the most important such effect is that of _ convection_. in particular , in a cdw moving with velocity @xmath48 , the partial time derivative @xmath51 in eq .",
    "[ flreom ]  must be replaced by the total convective derivative @xmath52 .",
    "more generally , the linear derivative ( @xmath53 ) term arises because the electric field breaks the reflection symmetry @xmath54 .",
    "note that the coefficient of this term is small for small velocities , which is why it is neglected in the usual equilibrium and near - static ( i.e. cdw depinning ) contexts .",
    "a second term ordinarily omitted from the flr equation in equilibrium arises from coupling to the underlying periodic lattice .",
    "this intrinsic pinning in the direction of motion can be incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ flreom ] ) by the replacement @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a periodic potential , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is in general incommensurate with @xmath59 .",
    "while in other contexts such an incommensurate periodic potential can be safely neglected , we will see that it gives rise to important effects for the asymptotic behavior in the strongly driven limit .    including both these effects ,",
    "we arrive at a suitable generalization of the flr equation , @xmath60\\sin(2k_f   x+\\phi(\\bfr , t ) ) , \\label{generalflr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again a numerical factor has been absorbed into the periodic potential @xmath61 .",
    "we have allowed for renormalizations of the convective term by keeping the coefficient @xmath62 general , but we expect @xmath63 .",
    "[ generalflr ]  is capable of describing the behavior of the cdw ( up to the aforementioned caveats respecting phase slips and thermal fluctuations ) in the full range of applied fields from well below to far above the nominal threshold field .",
    "in fact , eq .  [ generalflr ]  is so general that it is a rather inappropriate point from which to study the moving state .",
    "this is made evident by making the transformation @xmath64 , in order to focus on the fluctuations @xmath65 around the uniformly sliding cdw .",
    "the resulting equation of motion for @xmath65 contains force terms which oscillate rapidly in time . to determine their effect at time scales longer than @xmath66 , one must develop instead an _ effective _ equation of motion for a coarse - grained ( temporally and spatially averaged ) phase @xmath67 . in what follows",
    "we will drop the overbar and denote the coarse - grained phase variations simply by @xmath65 .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure may be explicitly performed in two different ways .",
    "the simplest method is a variant of the high - velocity expansion about the sliding state@xcite , obtained by iterating a formulation of eq .",
    "[ generalflr ]  as an integral equation .",
    "a more complicated , but conceptually more clear approach is to coarse - grain using renormalization group ( rg ) methods , in which short wavelength and high frequency components of @xmath65 are explicitly integrated out in a field - theoretic formulation .",
    "a similar calculation was carried out recently in a different context by rost and spohn@xcite .",
    "both approaches are straightforward but tedious , and we simply quote the results in what follows@xcite .    several simplifications are obtained in this effective coarse - grained description .",
    "the most important is the modification of the random potential term @xmath68 , which , as mentioned before becomes oscillatory .",
    "a careful treatment reveals , however , that this term does not strictly average to zero in the coarse - grained model .",
    "instead , as discussed in refs.@xcite , it generates an effective spatially varying drag force @xmath69 . to leading order in @xmath70",
    ", its correlations are @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this may be understood physically as simply reflecting variations of the impurity density in different regions of the sample , which then exert a spatially random drag force on the cdw .",
    "an important difference between this term and the original sine - gordon type term is that it does not prefer any particular value of the phase variation @xmath65 .",
    "this is in fact an exact result in the moving phase , reflecting the non - trivial transformation property @xmath73 under a time - translation @xmath74 . in general terms , the equilibrium ordered phase of the cdw is described as a state of spontaneously broken spatial translation symmetry .",
    "this state is highly susceptible to disorder , because randomness explicitly breaks precisely this symmetry ",
    "i.e. it acts as a random field .",
    "by contrast , the sliding cdw breaks _",
    "time_-translation symmetry , which is an _",
    "exact _ invariance of the system , even with @xmath75 .",
    "a second simplification occurs in the intrinsic pinning term . like the random potential",
    ", this term also becomes oscillatory in time , but generates a non - trivial correction upon coarse - graining . to second order in a gradient expansion , the correction has the form of an additional drag force @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 are constants .",
    "physically , the gradient corrections arise because the drag force from intrinsic pinning becomes less effective as the cdw wavevector ( whose local shift is proportional to @xmath78 ) becomes less commensurate with the underlying lattice . for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the isotropic case @xmath79 , which is expected to be approximately correct for cdws whose density profile is well approximated by the single fourier harmonic form of eq .",
    "[ cdw ]  and which is not too far from commensurability .",
    "the resulting gradient - squared correction is a realization of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) nonlinearity in the cdw system .",
    "the final coarse - grained equation of motion is @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "this coefficient is positive , because a mis - oriented cdw ( with @xmath82 ) is less slowed down than an aligned one ( with @xmath83 ) .",
    "[ eomeffective ]  is the basis for our study of the moving state .",
    "we caution , however , that some information is lost in this approach , and various non - universal high energy features of the cdw behavior are no longer easily calculable .",
    "an important example is the full form of the i - v curve . as can be explicitly seen in the coarse - graining procedure , the cdw frequency @xmath84 as a function of @xmath42 or @xmath45 has non - trivial contributions from the short - wavelength degrees of freedom not contained in eq .",
    "[ eomeffective ] .",
    "an additional difficulty is that the drag forces @xmath85 and @xmath86 are strongly force dependent .",
    "our long - wavelength description _ does _ , however , capture the _ singular _ part of the cdw velocity .",
    "we define @xmath87 where the overbar denotes a spatial average and the brackets denote the disorder average .",
    "the quantity @xmath88 is actually a frequency shift .",
    "note that , because this includes only the singular part of the @xmath89 relation , there is no particular preferred sign for @xmath90 .",
    "the spatial fluctuations of the phase can be characterized by their growth with the system size .",
    "a useful measure of such fluctuations employed in the study of interface dynamics is the `` interface width '' in the long - time saturated regime , given by @xmath91 ^ 2}>^{1/2 } \\label{width}\\ ] ] in a d - dimensional system of size @xmath92 .    if the kpz term is neglected in eq .",
