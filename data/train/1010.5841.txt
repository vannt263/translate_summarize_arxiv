    ", we can assume that @xmath39 has the form either @xmath563 with @xmath564 or @xmath565 with @xmath564 , @xmath566 and @xmath567 .",
    "in the former case it follows that @xmath568 and @xmath569 , while in the latter we have that @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "an asymptotic bound can be obtained from the remark that the number of pairs @xmath572 such that @xmath573 and that @xmath574 is at most @xmath575 .",
    "indeed , @xmath576 the lemma follows from considering the bounds for @xmath341 and @xmath577 .",
    "@xmath258    note that the representation of a number @xmath39 is not unique ; for instance , the numbers @xmath578 and @xmath579 represent the same @xmath39 .",
    "however , this detail only makes our bound rougher .",
    "a more careful counting shows that @xmath580 is indeed an upper bound for the number of algebraic integers of degree 2 lying in @xmath280 . as a way of illustration , see that for @xmath283 there are @xmath581 algebraic integers between @xmath298 and @xmath299 while for @xmath582 there are @xmath583 algebraic integers lying in @xmath584 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theo : finiteness ] follows immediately from claims 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "theorem [ theo : finiteness ] did not settle the finiteness of cubic graphs with cyclic defect or excess . in this subsection",
    "we take care of this case .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theo:3def ] first exploits the fact that for a cubic graph of diameter @xmath13 and cyclic defect , or a cubic graph of girth @xmath480 and cyclic excess , the polynomial @xmath585 must have an integer root @xmath500 between @xmath586 and @xmath587 . in this direction",
    "we prove that @xmath588 , and in this case , @xmath589 and @xmath590 , thus ruling out the existence of graphs with cyclic defect . as the order @xmath7 of cubic graph with cyclic",

    "in addition , if @xmath590 then @xmath222 , so @xmath592 must also have algebraic roots of degree 1 or 2 . recall that all these algebraic integers lie on the interval @xmath593 .",
    "the next step of the proof is to settle that @xmath594 is the only algebraic integer of degree at most 2 for which the polynomial @xmath595 , where @xmath596 .",
    "the conditions that @xmath545 , @xmath597 and @xmath589 greatly narrow down the numbers @xmath356 that could make @xmath598 ; we then prove that the only such numbers are @xmath599 and @xmath600 .",
    "the proof ends when we prove that , in fact under all the previous conditions , for @xmath599 @xmath600 the polynomial @xmath601 .",
    "[ theo:3def ] for @xmath221 there is no graph of degree 3 , diameter @xmath71 and cyclic defect .",

    "suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that there is at least a cubic graph of diameter @xmath602 and cyclic defect , and at least a graph of girth @xmath89 and cyclic excess .",
    "relying on corollaries [ cor : evenn ] and [ cor : evennex ] , next we discard the values of @xmath439 and @xmath603 for which @xmath591 is different from @xmath478 or @xmath195 .",
    "note that @xmath604 , @xmath605 , @xmath606 are multiples of 4 if @xmath453 and that @xmath607 if @xmath56 ; this can be checked easily by induction .",
    "for @xmath467 the polynomial @xmath608 has no factor of degree 1 or 2 to be used with the eigenvalue 0 of the matrix @xmath609 ( see corollary [ cor:3,4,6 ] ) .",

    "computing modulo 32 we see that the value @xmath589 can be attained only if @xmath613 . in this case , these graphs have an order multiple of 4 and @xmath614 , and therefore , we must add the conditions that @xmath591 and @xmath592 have algebraic roots of degree 1 or 2 .",
    "henceforth , together with the integers @xmath615 and 2 , we analyze the set of the 38 algebraic integers of degree 2 between @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "these numbers are as follows : @xmath616 for @xmath617 , @xmath618 for @xmath619 , @xmath620 for @xmath621 and at last @xmath622 .",

    "the function @xmath606 in @xmath13 is null for @xmath596 .",

    "the function @xmath629 in @xmath13 is periodic and never null for @xmath596 ; the same happens for @xmath630 and @xmath631 .",

    "@xmath633 of quadratic number @xmath356 is @xmath634 . ] in the _ algebraic extension _ is called algebraic if every element of @xmath635 is algebraic over @xmath636 . ] @xmath637 .",

    "generated by 2 in the ring @xmath555 of algebraic integers , then the polynomial @xmath644 never enters into that ideal , and thus , never vanishes .",
    "this is the case for the numbers @xmath645 , @xmath646 , @xmath647 , @xmath648,@xmath622 , @xmath649 , and @xmath650 .    for the numbers",
    "@xmath651 we note that for @xmath652 the number @xmath653 has the form @xmath654 with @xmath655 , and that for @xmath656 the number @xmath657 has the form @xmath658 with @xmath655 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath659 .",
    "therefore , we have ruled out all the numbers @xmath660 .",
    "note that if @xmath661 then @xmath662 .    finally , observe that for @xmath652 the number @xmath663 has the form @xmath664 with @xmath655 .",
    "this leaves the numbers @xmath665 out .",
    "this completes the proof of the claim .",
    "we finalize the proof of the theorem by showing the following two claims .",
    "* claim 2 . *",
    "provided that @xmath652 with @xmath545 , @xmath597 and @xmath589 , the only numbers @xmath356 that could make @xmath598 are @xmath599 and @xmath600 .",
    "* proof of claim 2 . * set @xmath632 , then to have simultaneously @xmath597 , @xmath589 and @xmath598 we must have that @xmath666 and that @xmath667 .",
    "since the coefficients of @xmath591 are integers , the former condition means that @xmath668 divides 1 in the ring of integers of @xmath669 , while the latter condition implies that @xmath638 divides 1 in the aforementioned ring .",
    "these conditions also imply that the norms of @xmath668 and @xmath638 in the algebraic extension @xmath670 must be @xmath671 or @xmath297 .",
    "thus , only the numbers @xmath672 and @xmath673 satisfy both conditions . @xmath258    * claim 3 . * for @xmath652 with @xmath545 , the polynomials @xmath674 and @xmath675 never take the value 1 .    *",
    "proof of claim 3 .",
    "* we first consider the value @xmath676 , and claim that for @xmath677 with @xmath678 , the values @xmath679 are never integers .",
    "observe that @xmath680 and that @xmath681 .",
    "as @xmath682 and @xmath683 , by induction @xmath684 . ]",
    ", we obtain that @xmath685 , which is not the norm of an integer .",
    "recall that the norm of integers is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4 .",
    "this approach also rules out the value @xmath686 .",
    "the values of @xmath687 are never 1 for @xmath688 .",

    "while substantial progress in this direction was made through algebraic approaches , definitive solutions to problems [ probrep ] and [ probex ] still seem to be elusive , mainly due to the complexity of the theoretical problems that emerged during our investigation .",
