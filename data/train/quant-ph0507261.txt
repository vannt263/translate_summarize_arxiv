    "much progress has been made recently in experimental studies of periodically modulated vibrational systems .",
    "examples include optically bistable systems , electrons in penning traps , josephson junctions , and various nano- and micro - mechanical resonators @xcite-@xcite .",
    "all these systems display bistability of forced vibrations .",
    "because of thermal or externally applied noise , there occurs switching between coexisting stable vibrational states .",
    "the measured switching probabilities of noise - induced transitions are in a good agreement with the theoretical predictions .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of a quantum oscillator .",
    "the generality of the oscillator as a model system and the current interest in quantum computing and coherent phenomena lead to two major questions : ( i ) does a resonantly driven oscillator display coherent quantum effects that would qualitatively differ from those in two - level systems , and ( ii ) in the presence of relaxation , what is the probability of switching between coexisting stable states due to quantum fluctuations ? these two questions are addressed in the present paper , which is based on the results @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a weakly nonlinear oscillator is a multi - level quantum system with nearly equidistant energy levels @xmath0 .",
    "therefore a periodic force of frequency @xmath1 can be nearly resonant for many transitions at a time , i.e. , @xmath2 can be close to the interlevel distance @xmath3 for many @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to strong nonlinearity of the response even to comparatively weak resonant fields .",
    "a well - known quantum effect of the oscillator nonlinearity is the onset of rabi oscillations due to resonant multiphoton transitions .",
    "multiphoton rabi oscillations occur when the spacing between remote energy levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 coincides with the energy of @xmath6 photons , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the multiphoton transition amplitude is resonantly enhanced , because an @xmath8 transition occurs via a sequence of virtual field - induced transitions @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) , all of which are almost resonant . an associated classical effect , in the presence of dissipation , is hysteresis of the amplitude of forced vibrations as function of the field amplitude @xmath11 and @xmath1 .    in this paper ( see also @xcite ) we show that multiphoton transitions in the oscillator are accompanied by a new effect , _ antiresonance _ of the response . when the frequency of the driving field adiabatically passes through a resonant value , the vibration amplitude displays a sharp minimum or maximum , depending on the initially occupied state .",
    "we argue that the antiresonance and the multiphoton rabi oscillations can be observed in josephson junctions .",
    "if the frequency @xmath1 is close to twice the oscillator frequency , then @xmath2 is close to @xmath12 for many @xmath4 at a time .",
    "this leads to parametric resonance in the oscillator , in which it oscillates at frequency @xmath13 in response to the driving .",
    "such oscillations are intrinsically bistable , because their phase can take on two values that differ by @xmath14 .    we will be most interested in the semiclassical behavior of the oscillator , which , on the one hand , stretches all the way to the classical region , and on the other hand , works well for oscillators even deep in the quantum domain . in the semiclassical picture",
    ", resonant multiphoton transitions correspond to tunneling between floquet states of the oscillator with equal quasienergies .",
    "[ the quasienergy @xmath15 gives the change of the wave function @xmath16 when time is incremented by the modulation period @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the occurrence of equal - quasienergy states is related to the bistability of forced vibrations of a classical oscillator .",
    "tunneling of a driven oscillator is a carefully studied@xcite example of dynamical tunneling @xcite .",
    "the wkb analysis gives an important insight into the origin of the antiresonance , which goes beyond the perturbation theory in the driving field .",
    "dynamical tunneling also leads to transitions between coexisting metastable states of forced vibrations , which emerge in the presence of dissipation due to coupling to a thermal reservoir . in terms of quantum mechanics ,",
    "dissipation is due to interlevel oscillator transitions with energy being transferred to ( or from , for nonzero temperature ) the reservoir .",
    "it turns out that dissipation may also lead to transitions between metastable states of forced vibrations , even for zero temperature @xcite",
    ".    for @xmath19 there occur only interlevel transitions where the oscillator energy goes to the reservoir ( but the energy loss is compensated by the driving field , in the stationary regime ) . however , the quasi - energy may increase or decrease as a result of a coupling - to - reservoir induced transition , although with different probabilities .",
    "therefore along with drift over quasienergy towards a metastable state , which results from more probable transition , there emerges diffusion away from this state as a sequence of less probable transitions .",
    "the diffusion may lead to activated - like escape .",
    "activation in this case has purely quantum nature , and therefore we call it quantum activation .",

    "it is convenient to analyze the dynamics in the rotating wave approximation by switching from the fast oscillating operators @xmath25 to slowly varying operators @xmath26 using transformations @xmath27 for resonant driving and @xmath28 for parametric driving , with @xmath29 and @xmath30    the variables @xmath26 are the appropriately scaled coordinate and momentum .",
