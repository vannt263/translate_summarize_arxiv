    "the first observations of kondo effect in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite have spurred a great deal of experimental and theoretical activity during the last few years . since these experimental breakthroughs , remarkable achievements",
    "have been reported , including the observation of the unitary limit,@xcite the singlet - triplet kondo effect , @xcite kondo effect in molecular conductors @xcite , and the kondo effect in qds connected to ferromagnetic @xcite and superconducting reservoirs , @xcite just to mention a few .",
    "recently , jarillo - herrero _ et al . _ reported perhaps the most sophisticated example , namely the observation of an orbital kondo effect in a carbon nanotube ( cnt ) quantum dot ( qd).@xcite in these experiments it was shown that the delocalized electrons of the reservoirs can screen both the orbital pseudospin degrees of freedom in the cnt qd ( the @xmath0-k@xmath2 double orbital degeneracy of the two - dimensional band structure of graphene ) and the usual spin degrees of freedom , resulting in an su(4 ) kondo effect at low temperatures . in a recent letter , @xcite we showed that quantum fluctuations between the orbital and spin degrees of freedom may indeed dominate transport at low temperatures and lead to this highly symmetric su(4 ) kondo effect .",
    "more recently , sakano and kawakami@xcite have studied , using the bethe ansatz method at zero temperature and the non - crossing approximation at finite temperatures , the more general case where the quantum numbers of @xmath3 degenerate orbital levels are conserved , and found new interesting features of the su(@xmath4)-symmetric kondo effect .",
    "importantly , this is true provided that both the orbital and spin indices are conserved during tunneling .",
    "this poses an interesting question about the nature of the nanotube - lead contact because , in principle , there is no special reason why the orbital degrees of freedom in the cnt should be conserved during tunneling .    as mentioned , this orbital pseudospin originates from the peculiar electronic structure of the nanotube ( nt ) .",
    "@xcite the electronic states of a nt form one - dimensional electron and hole sub - bands as a result of the quantization of the electron wavenumber @xmath5 perpendicular to the nt axis , which arises when graphene is wrapped into a cylinder to create a nt . by symmetry , for a given sub - band at @xmath6",
    "there is a second degenerate sub - band at @xmath7 .",
    "semiclassically , this orbital degeneracy corresponds to the clockwise ( @xmath8 ) or counterclockwise ( @xmath9 ) symmetry of the wrapping modes .",
    "a plausible explanation of why this degree of freedom is preserved during tunneling could be that the qd is likely coupled to nt electrodes ( the metal electrodes are deposited on top of the nt so maybe the electrons tunneling out of the qd enter the nt section underneath the contacts ) but this issue clearly deserves a thorough microscopic analysis about the nature of the contacts .",
    "the conservation of the orbital quantum number seems more likely in the vertical quantum dots ( vqd),@xcite where the orbital quantum number is the magnetic quantum number of the angular momentum .    here",
    ", we take a different route and , assuming some degree of mixing in the orbital channel , ask ourselves about the robustness of the su(4 ) kondo effect against asymmetry in the couplings and/or mixing .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the relevant model hamiltonian and classify different schemes of the lead - dot coupling .",
    "these different coupling schemes result in different symmetries and hence affect significantly the underlying kondo physics .",
