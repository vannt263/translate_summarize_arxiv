    "the problem of the quantum state of a nucleating bubble has been addressed in the literature several times@xcite . the results relevant for our discussion",
    "can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have a self - interacting scalar field @xmath2 ( the tunneling field ) described by the lagrangian @xmath3 where @xmath4 has a local ( metastable ) minimum at some value @xmath5 and a global one at @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ potencial ] ) .",
    "the bubble nucleation can be pictured as the evolution of the @xmath2 field in imaginary time .",
    "the solution of the corresponding euclidean time equation which interpolates between the false vacuum at spacetime infinity and the true vacuum inside the bubble is called the bounce . in the absence of gravity ,",
    "vacuum decay is dominated by the @xmath7 symmetric bounce solution @xcite .",
    "so we shall write the tunneling field as a function of @xmath8 alone , @xmath9 where @xmath10 are cartesian coordinates in euclidean space .",
    "the solution describing the bubble after nucleation is given by the analytic continuation of the bounce to minkowski time @xmath11 through the substitution @xmath12 .",
    "then , the bubble solution depends only on the lorentz invariant quantity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the usual minkowski coordinates .",
    "if there are quantum fields interacting with the tunneling field , their state will be significantly affected by the change of vacuum state .",
    "pioneering investigations of this matter were carried out by rubakov @xcite and vachaspati and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "these latter authors considered a model of two interacting scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath15 , and found the quantum state for @xmath16 ( the quantum counterpart of @xmath15 ) by solving its functional scrdinger equation . in order to find a solution , they impose as boundary conditions for the wave function @xmath17 $ ] regularity under the barrier and the tunneling boundary condition ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "they found that the quantum state must be so(3,1 ) invariant .",
    "+    _ _ _ _ _ _    a somewhat different approach was pursued later by sasaki and tanaka @xcite .",
    "they carried out a refinement of the method for constructing the wkb wave function for multidimensional systems , first introduced by banks , bender and wu @xcite and extended to field theory by vega , gervais and sakita @xcite , and obtained the so called quasi - ground state wave function .",
    "the quasi - ground state wave function is a solution of the time independent functional schrdinger equation to the second order in the wkb approximation which is sufficiently localized at the false vacuum so that it would be the ground state wave functional it there were no tunneling .",
    "they also found that the state must be so(3,1 ) invariant .",
    "moreover , general arguments , due to coleman @xcite , suggest that the decay must be so(3,1 ) invariant .",
    "if not , the infinite volume lorentz group will make the nucleation probability diverge . from a practical point of view , therefore , it would be interesting to know to what extent symmetry considerations alone can be used to determine the quantum state after nucleations . as a first approach to this question it will be useful to compute the two - point function and the renormalized expectation value of the stress tensor in a so(3,1 ) invariant quantum state for two simples models of one - bubble spacetimes .",
    "our aim is to study the quantum state of a field @xmath15 described by a lagrangian of the general form @xmath18 where the mass term is due to the interaction of the field @xmath15 with a nucleating bubble .",
    "working from the very beginning in the heisenberg picture , we will construct an so(3,1 ) invariant quantum state for the field @xmath16 . after we will find its hadamard two - point function @xmath19 , and we will check whether it is of the hadamard form @xcite . loosely speaking ,",
    "a hadamard state can be described as a state for which the singular part of @xmath20 takes the form @xmath21 where @xmath2 denotes half of the square of the geodesic distance between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are smooth functions that can be expanded as a power series in @xmath2 , at least for @xmath23 in a small neighborhood of @xmath22 .",
    "hadamard states are considered physically acceptable because for them the point - splitting prescription gives a satisfactory definition of the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor . after clarifying the singular structure of @xmath20",
    ", we will use the point - splitting formalism @xcite to compute the renormalized expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor in this quantum state .",
    "finally we will briefly discuss the applicability of a uniqueness theorem for quantum states due to kay and wald @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we will restrict ourselves to piecewise flat spacetime .",
    "it proves very useful to use coordinates adapted to the symmetry of the problem . so we will coordinatize flat minkowski space using hyperbolic slices , which will embody the symmetry under lorentz transformations .",
    "we define the new coordinates @xmath26 ( milne coordinates ) by the equations @xmath27 where @xmath14 are the usual minkowski coordinates . in terms of these coordinates",
    ", we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the metric on the unit 3-dimensional spacelike hyperboloid , and @xmath30 is the line element on a unit sphere .",
    "the above coordinates cover only the interior of the lightcone from the origin . in order to cover the exterior",
    ", we will use the rindler coordinates @xmath31 in terms of this coordinates , the line element reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the metric on the @xmath34 hypersurfaces , and @xmath35 is the line element on a unit `` radius '' ( 2 + 1)-dimensional de sitter space , @xmath36    the milne and the rindler coordinates are related by analytic continuation , @xmath37 notice that @xmath38 is timelike inside the lightcone and becomes spacelike after analytical continuation to the outside , whereas @xmath39 is spacelike inside the lightcone but its analytical continuation is time - like .",

    "here we will consider two simple models .",
    "first we shall consider a massless field living in the vilenkin - ipser - sikivie spacetime@xcite .",
    "the vis spacetime represents the global gravitational field of a reflection symmetric domain wall , and can be constructed by gluing two minkowski spaces at some @xmath40 , the locus corresponding to the evolution of the bubble wall ( see fig .",
    "[ vis ] ) .",
    "the second model we will study is a field which interacts with the tunneling field only on the bubble wall . for the tunneling field",
    ", we will assume the thin bubble wall approximation .",
    "more general models of the form ( [ wish ] ) will be considered elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the quantization will be performed in the `` rindler wedges '' of these spaces , because the hypersurfaces @xmath41 are cauchy surfaces for the whole spacetime .       +    _ _ _ _ _ _    here we consider a massless field living in a spacetime constructed by gluing two minkowski spaces at some @xmath40 .",
    "we take rindler coordinates in the region outside the origin of the two pieces , using a rindler patch for each one . on each side ,",
    "the rindler coordinate @xmath42 , where the index @xmath43 or @xmath39 refers to the left or right pieces , ranges from @xmath44 on the lightcone to some value @xmath45 , where the two minkowski pieces are identified . defining @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we can coordinatize both pieces letting @xmath48 range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath53 is the heaviside step function .    in order to construct a quantum state ,",
    "we expand the field operator @xmath54 in terms of a sum over a complete set of mode functions times the corresponding creation and annihilation operators , @xmath55 the mode functions @xmath56 satisfy the field equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 stands here for the four dimensional dalambertian operator in the vis spacetime . taking the ansatz @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , equation ( [ eqmassless ] ) decouples into @xmath62f_p & = p^2 f_p.\\label{eqf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath63 stands for the covariant dalembertian on a ( 2 + 1 ) de sitter space",

    "if we let @xmath68 take positive and negative values , the normalized mode functions @xmath65 for @xmath66 , which are the usual scattering waves , can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 the normalized supercurvature mode @xmath67 is given by @xmath71 where the coma indicates that @xmath72 refers to @xmath73 instead of @xmath68 .",
    "as we are interested in a so(3,1 ) invariant state , the natural choice for @xmath64 are the positive frequency ( 2 + 1 ) bunch - davies modes @xcite , @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the usual spherical harmonics . with this choice , it is straightforward to show that the quantum state for @xmath76 is so(3,1 ) invariant .",
    "now we proceed to compute the two - point wightman function @xmath77 , @xmath78 from now on we will suppose that the two points @xmath22 and @xmath23 belong to the rindler wedge of the `` left minkowski '' space , so we will omit the @xmath79 index for notational simplicity .",

[ desitter ] ) . at the end of the calculation",
    ", we will take the limit @xmath99 .",
    "introducing @xmath100 , the two - point function @xmath101 can be compactly written as @xmath102 after performing the @xmath68 integration we obtain @xmath103     +    _ _ _ _ _ _    the `` supercurvature '' contribution of the @xmath67 mode is in fact divergent .",
    "this is related to the zero mode problem of massless quantum fields in spacetimes with compact cauchy surfaces . following the usual prescription @xcite , we formally write this divergent term as a divergent piece plus a finite one , @xmath104 where the infinity has been hidden in an infinite constant ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "after , when taking derivatives to compute the energy - momentum tensor , this divergent constant term will give no contribution .",

    "the first term in the final expression for @xmath20 is the usual minkowski ultraviolet divergence .",
    "the second term , @xmath108 , is due to the nontrivial geometric boundary conditions imposed by the symmetry of our problem .",
    "if @xmath108 were not singular , the state would be of the hadamard form@xcite .",

    ". it is logarithmically singular whenever one of the points is on the lightcone emanating from the origin .",
    "it is also singular when @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy the relation @xmath109 , so the argument of the logarithm diverges .",
    "the roots of this equation are at @xmath110 to clarify the position of the singularities , let us fix the point @xmath111 and look for the points @xmath112 which make @xmath113 singular .",
    "taking into account that @xmath114 and @xmath115 should be real and should satisfy @xmath116 , it is seen from ( [ rootsing ] ) that the allowed values of @xmath117 are of the form @xmath118 ( i.e. , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are `` timelike '' separated on a ( 2 + 1 ) de sitter hyperboloid , see fig .  [ zplane ] ) , with @xmath121 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath122 .",

    "this implies that @xmath124 , and we have no restriction on @xmath125 . since @xmath126 , we find that @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",

    "note that as @xmath22 approaches to the bubble wall ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) , the distance to the nearest singular point @xmath23 reduces .",

    "summarizing , the two - point function is locally hadamard everywhere except on the bubble wall and on the lightcone .",

    "the solution of this schrdinger equation is the scattering basis ( [ scatt ] ) with the transmission and reflection coefficients given by @xmath142 following a similar path , we arrive at the following hadamard two - point function ( for points @xmath22 , @xmath23 in the rindler wedge and inside the bubble ) , @xmath143\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & - \\left._2f_1\\left[1,v_0;v_0 + 1;-e^{-i\\tilde\\zeta } \\frac{\\xi_r\\xi'_r}{r_0 ^ 2}\\right]\\right)=\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2\\sigma}+w(x , x'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is explicitly so(3,1 ) invariant .",
    "if we take the coincidence limit , the function @xmath108 has divergences on the bubble wall , so the state is not locally hadamard .",
    "apart from this , it has nonlocal logarithmic singularities at the points where the argument of the hypergeometric functions become 1 , i.e. , whenever @xmath144 .",
    "this is the same relation we found in the vis model .",
    "borrowing the conclusions from the vis model , the state is locally hadamard everywhere except on the bubble wall , and has ( harmless ) timelike nonlocal singularities ( except also on the bubble wall ) .",
    "as we have seen , the two models we have considered share two singular behaviors : the existence of nonlocal singularities and the singularity of @xmath108 in the coincidence limit on the bubble wall . these singularities seem to be related with the oversimplification of the model . presumably , if instead of a @xmath145-like term interaction we had introduced a smooth function , these divergences would disappear .",
    "as we have pointed out , for the two models we have studied the singularities of @xmath20 are nearly of the hadamard type .",
    "we can use the point - splitting regularization prescription to compute the renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy momentum tensor @xcite , @xmath146,\\\\ { \\mathcal d}_{ab ' } & = \\nabla_a\\nabla_{b'}- \\frac{1}{2}g_{ab'}g^{cd'}\\nabla_c\\nabla_{d'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] noticing that @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is one half of the square distance in a unit ( 2 + 1 ) de sitter spacetime , the covariant derivatives in the `` de sitter '' direction are easily computed from @xcite @xmath149 & = 0 , \\\\ { [ ^{ds}\\sigma_{;ab ' } ] } & = -\\frac{g_{ab}}{\\xi_r^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the brackets stand for the coincidence limit .",

    "( i.e. , @xmath22 is in the left rindler wedge and inside the bubble ) .",
    "it is clear from the expression that the energy - momentum tensor behaves somewhat better than the two - point function .",
    "it is divergent on the bubble wall , but behaves smoothly on the lightcone .",
    "so it can be analytically continued to the inside of the lightcone .",
    "there it behaves like the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid , @xmath152 where @xmath153 . on the lightcone it satisfies the equation of state @xmath154 whith @xmath155 for large",
    "@xmath38 the equation of state turns out to be @xmath156 with @xmath157 taking into account that the field is massless except on the bubble - wall , one might naively expect that the energy momentum tensor would behave like radiation , with @xmath158 . instead of this",

    "as before , the energy - momentum tensor turns out to be singular only on the bubble wall .",
    "continuing analytically the results to the inside of the light - cone , we find that it is of the perfect fluid form . on the lightcone it satisfies the equation of state @xmath154 with @xmath160 for large",
    "@xmath38 the equation of state turns out to be @xmath161 with @xmath162 notice that in this model the energy density is negative and decreases faster than radiation .",
    "in this paper we have performed the computation of @xmath163 in a quantum state which fulfills our basic requirement of so(3,1 ) invariance . in fact",
    ", we have just outlined the most simple method to find a so(3,1 ) invariant state .",
    "the question is whether by choosing a different set of modes we can also obtain an inequivalent so(3,1 ) invariant state but also of the hadamard form .",
    "a theorem due to kay and wald @xcite is illuminating in this respect .",
    "the theorem states that in a spacetime with a bifurcate killing horizon there can exist at most one regular quasifree state invariant under the isometry which generates the bifurcate killing horizon .",
    "let us briefly analyze the conditions under which the theorem holds .    in ( 3 + 1 ) spacetimes",
    ", we get a bifurcate killing horizon whenever a one parameter group of isometries leaves invariant a 2-dimensional spacelike manifold @xmath164 .",
    "the bifurcate killing horizon is generated by the null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath164@xcite .",
    "for example , minkowski spacetime has bifurcate killing horizons .",
    "the isometry group is a one - parameter subgroup of lorentz boosts , and the manifold @xmath164 is a two - plane .",
    "any so(3,1 ) invariant spacetime , where the line element can be written in the form @xmath165 has a so(3,1 ) invariant bifurcate killing horizon .",
    "noticing that the @xmath34 hypersurfaces are ( 2 + 1 ) de sitter spaces which can be thought as embedded in a ( 3 + 1 ) minkowski space , any boost generator on these hypersurfaces is the infinitesimal generator of a isometry which 1 ) leaves invariant a spacelike 2-manifold ( so we get a bifurcate killing horizon ) and 2 ) leaves any so(3,1 ) symmetric state invariant .",
    "we can take , for example , the boost generator in the @xmath166 plane of the embedding minkowski space .",
    "expressed in the rindler coordinates , it becomes @xmath167 the killing field @xmath168 leaves invariant the spacelike 2-manifold @xmath169 , @xmath170 .",
    "all bubble spacetimes with or without the inclusion of gravity do possess this bifurcate killing horizon .",
    "a ( pure ) quasifree ground state is the ( wider ) algebraic version ( see @xcite and references therein ) of what is usually called a `` frequency splitting '' fock vacuum state .",
    "a quasifree state has the special property of being completely characterized from its two - point function .",
    "a regular quasifree ground state is a quasifree ground state whose two - point symmetric function is globally hadamard and which has no zero modes .",
    "the vis model has a zero mode ( as any massless field in spacetimes with compact cauchy surfaces have @xcite ) , so the theorem can not be directly applied .",
    "also strictly speaking , the quantum state we have found for the st model does not fulfill the requirements of the theorem , because it is not globally hadamard . roughly speaking",
    ", a two - point function is said to be globally hadamard if it is locally hadamard and in addition has nonlocal singularities only at points @xmath22 , @xmath23 which are null related within a causal normal neighborhood of a cauchy hypersurface .",
    "as we have seen , if we ignore the problems on the bubble wall , the hadamard function @xmath171 ) we have found for the st model has nonlocal singularities , but they are timelike related .",
    "so , if it were not for the singularities on the bubble wall , the state would be globally hadamard and without zero modes . as stated before",
    ", we think that the singularities on the bubble wall would disappear if the potential were modeled by a smooth function instead of by a @xmath145-like term , making the state globally hadamard . then , symmetry would suffice to determine the ( physically admissible ) quantum state for this model .",
    "generic models which would not present these pathologies will be presented elsewhere@xcite",
