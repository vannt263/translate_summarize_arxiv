    "among non - equilibrium dynamical systems , living organisms are the most challenging ones that scientists can study .",
    "a biological system constantly exchanges material , energy and information with the environment as it regulates its growth and survival .",
    "the energy and chemical balances at the cellular level involve an intricate interplay between the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic environment , through which life at the intermediate mesoscopic scale is maintained @xcite .",
    "the development of a multicellular structure requires non - equilibrium dynamics , as microscopic imbalances are translated into the macroscopic gradients that control collective action and growth @xcite .",
    "much effort is devoted to the search for basic principles of organization ( growth , communication , regulation and control ) on the cellular and multicellular levels @xcite .",
    "our approach is to use the successful conceptual framework for pattern formation in non - living systems as a tool to unravel their significantly more complex biological counterparts . of critical importance",
    "is the choice of starting point , i.e. the choice of which phenomena to study : it has to be simple enough to allow progress , but also well motivated by the significance of the results .",
    "cooperative microbial behavior is well suited for these requirements , as we explain below .",
    "we focus on two examples : the branching growth in bacterial colonies of , and the chiral growth of",
    ". examples of these patterns are shown in fig.[fig : intro ] .",
    "traditionally , bacterial colonies are grown on substrates with a high nutrient level and intermediate agar concentration @xcite .",
    "such `` friendly '' conditions yield colonies of simple compact patterns , which fit well the contemporary view of bacterial colonies as a collection of independent unicellular organisms ( non - interacting `` particles '' ) . however",
    ", bacterial colonies in nature must regularly cope with hostile environmental conditions @xcite . when hostile conditions are created in a petri dish by using a very low level of nutrients , a hard surface ( high concentration of agar ) , or both , very complex patterns are observed .",
    "drawing on the analogy with diffusive patterning in non - living systems @xcite , we can state that complex patterns are expected .",
    "the cellular reproduction rate that determines the growth rate of the colony is limited by the level of nutrients available for the cells .",
    "the latter is limited by the diffusion of nutrients towards the colony ( for low nutrient substrate ) .",
    "hence colony growth under certain conditions should be similar to diffusion limited growth in non - living systems as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "the study of diffusive patterning in non - living systems teaches us that the diffusion field drives the system towards decorated ( on many length scales ) irregular fractal shapes @xcite .",
    "indeed , bacterial colonies can develop patterns reminiscent of those observed during growth in non - living systems @xcite .",
    "but , this is certainly not the end of the story .",
    "in fact , the colonies exhibit far richer behavior .",
    "this is ultimately a reflection of the additional levels of complexity involved @xcite .",
    "the building blocks of the colonies are themselves living systems , each having its own autonomous self - interest and internal degrees of freedom . yet ,",
    "efficient adaptation of the colony to adverse growth conditions requires self - organization on all levels which can only be achieved via cooperative behavior of these individual cells .",
    "thus , pattern formation at the colony level may be viewed as the outcome of a dynamical interplay @xcite between the micro - level ( the individual cell ) and the macro - level ( the colony ) . for this interplay to work",
    ", the effects of changes at the micro - level must make themselves felt at the macro - level .",
    "this is why the notion of a singular perturbation , discovered to be a key for understanding pattern selection in non - living systems , will be of even more importance here .",
    "this manuscript is mainly a review of our modeling studies . yet",
    "we include some important new results : 1 .",
    "explanations and modeling of chemotaxis during chiral growth .",
    "2 . modeling and characterization of weak chirality ( global weak twist ) during branching growth .",
    "for completeness , section [ sec : bio - bg ] includes a brief description of the necessary biological background needed to justify our models of the growth .",
    "how should one approach the modeling of the complex bacterial patterning ?",
    "with present computational power it is natural to use computer models as a main tool in the study of complex systems .",
    "however , one must be careful not to be trapped in the `` reminiscence syndrome '' , described by j. d. cowan @xcite , as the tendency to devise a set of rules which will mimic some aspect of the observed phenomena and then , to quote j. d. cowan `` they say : ` look , is nt this reminiscent of a biological or physical phenomenon ! '",
    "they jump in right away as if it s a decent model for the phenomenon , and usually of course it s just got some accidental features that make it look like something . ''",
    "yet the reminiscence modeling approach has some indirect value .",
    "true , doing so does not reveal ( directly ) the biological functions and behavior .",
    "however , it does reflect understanding of geometrical and temporal features of the patterns , which indirectly might help in revealing the underlying biological principles .",
    "another extreme is the `` realistic modeling '' approach , where one constructs a model that includes in details all the known biological facts about the system .",
    "such an approach sets a trajectory of ever including more and more details ( vs. generalized features ) .",
    "the model keeps evolving to include so many details that it loses any predictive power .",
    "here we try to promote another approach  the `` generic modeling '' one @xcite .",
    "we seek to elicit , from the experimental observations and the biological knowledge , the generic features and basic principles needed to explain the biological behavior and to include these features in the model .",
    "we will demonstrate that such modeling , with close comparison to experimental observations , can be used as a research tool to reveal new understanding of the biological systems .",
    "generic modeling is not about using sophisticated , as it may , mathematical description to dress pre - existing understanding of complex biological behavior .",
    "rather , it means a cooperative approach , using existing biological knowledge together with mathematical tools and synergetic point of view for complex systems to reach a new understanding ( which is reflected in the constructed model ) of the observed complex phenomena .",
    "the generic models can yet be grouped into two main categories : 1 .",
    "discrete models such as the communicating walkers models of ben - jacob @xcite and the bions model of kessler and levine @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the microorganisms ( bacteria in the first model and amoebae in second ) are represented by discrete , random walking entities ( walkers and bions , respectively ) which can consume nutrients , reproduce , perform random or biased movement , and produce or respond to chemicals .",
    "the time evolution of the chemicals is described by reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "2 . continuous or reaction - diffusion models @xcite .",
    "in these models the microorganisms are represented via their 2d density , and a reaction - diffusion equation of this density describes their time evolution .",
    "this equation is coupled to the other reaction - diffusion equations for the chemical fields . in the context of branching growth ,",
    "this idea has been pursued recently by mimura and matsushita @xcite , kawasaki @xcite , kitsunezaki @xcite and kozlovsky @xcite .",
    "a summary and critique of this approach can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : cont - models ] we present the continuous modeling of the branching growth . in section [ sec : c ] the chiral growth is modeled using the `` atomistic '' communicating spinors model , which enables us to model chemotaxis response .",
    "it is the first time that the chemotaxis effect on chiral growth has been studied .",
    "the actual study of chemotaxis , both in the chiral growth and the branching growth is done in section [ sec : chemo ] .",
    "section [ sec : weak_chiral ] is devoted to the studies of weak chirality .",
    "the phenomenon is modeled using both continuous and discrete models .",
    "we introduce a measure for weak chirality which enables a more crucial comparison between the models results and the observed patterns .",
    "good agreement was found .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we explain that the weak chirality phenomenon is general , and show examples of weak chirality during growth of the chiral morphotype and the vortex morphotype . in the latter it results from a different mechanism , and",
    "indeed the twist is not linear with the radius of growth .",
    "following the experimental observations which are explained in this manuscript , we will describe the most relevant information for the understanding and modeling of the observed colonial patterning .",
    "we base relevancy on our previous experience and we concentrate on bacterial movement .        some additional examples of the patterns exhibited by colonies of the are shown in figures [ fig:2.1 ] , [ fig:2.2 ] and [ fig:2.3 ] . for intermediate agar concentrations ( about 1.5% ",
    "@xmath0 in @xmath1 ) , at very high peptone levels ( above 10@xmath2 ) the patterns are compact ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.2]a ) .",
    "at somewhat lower but still high peptone levels ( about 5 - 10@xmath2 ) the patterns exhibit quite pronounced radial symmetry and may be characterized as dense fingers ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.2]b ) , each finger being much wider than the distance between fingers . for intermediate peptone levels , branching patterns with lower fractal dimension ( reminiscent of electro - chemical deposition ) are observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.2]c ) .",
    "the patterns are `` bushy '' , with branch width smaller than the distance between branches .",
    "as the peptone level is lowered , the patterns become more ramified and fractal  like .",
    "surprisingly , at even lower peptone levels ( below 0.25@xmath2 for 2% agar concentration ) the colonies revert to organized structures : fine branches forming a well defined global envelope .",
    "we characterize these patterns as fine radial branches ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.2]d ) .",
    "for extremely low peptone levels ( below 0.1@xmath2 ) , the colonies lose the fine radial structure and again exhibit fractal patterns ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.3 ] ) . for high agar concentration",
    "the branches are very thin ( fig . [",
    "fig:2.3]b ) .    at high agar concentration and very high peptone levels the colonies display a structure of concentric rings ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.4 ] ) . at high agar concentrations",
    "the branches also exhibit a global twist with the same handedness ( weak chirality ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2.5 ] .",
    "similar observations during growth of other bacterial strains have been reported by matsuyama @xcite .",
    "we referred to such growth patterns as having weak chirality , as opposed to the strong chirality exhibited by the",
    ".    a closer look at an individual branch ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.6 ] ) reveals a phenomenon of density variations within the branches .",
    "these 3-dimensional structures arise from accumulation of cells in layers .",
    "the aggregates can form spots and ridges which are either scattered randomly , ordered in rows , or organized in a leaf - veins - like structure .",
    "the aggregates are not frozen ; the cells in them are motile and the aggregates are dynamically maintained .      under the microscope , cells are seen to perform a random - walk - like movement in a fluid .",
    "this fluid is , we assume , excreted by the cells and/or drawn by the cells from the agar @xcite .",
    "the cellular movement is confined to this fluid ; isolated cells spotted on the agar surface do not move .",
    "the boundary of the fluid thus defines a local boundary for the branch ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.9 ] ) .",
    "whenever the cells are active , the boundary propagates slowly as a result of the cellular movement pushing the envelope forward and production of additional wetting fluid .",
    "electron microscope observations reveal that these bacteria have flagella for swimming .",
    "the observations reveal also that the cells are active at the outer parts of the colony , while closer to the center the cells are stationary and some of them sporulate ( form spores ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.10 ] ) .",
    "it is known that certain bacteria respond to adverse growth conditions by entering a spore stage until more favorable growth conditions return .",
    "such spores are metabolically inert and exhibit a marked resistance to the lethal effects of heat , drying , freezing , deleterious chemicals , and radiation .    at very low agar concentrations ( below 0.5% ) the bacteria swim inside the agar and not on its surface .",
    "between 0.5% and 1% agar concentration some of the bacteria move on the surface and some inside the agar .",
    "chiral asymmetry ( first discovered by louis pasteur ) exists in a whole range of scales , from subatomic particles through human beings to galaxies , and seems to have played an important role in the evolution of living systems @xcite . bacteria display various chiral properties .",
    "mendelson @xcite showed that long cells of can grow in helices , in which the cells form long strings that twist around each other .",
    "they have shown also that the chiral characteristics affect the structure of the colony .",
    "ben - jacob @xcite have found yet another chiral property  the strong chirality exhibited by the . here",
    ", the flagella handedness acts as a microscopic perturbation which is amplified by the diffusive instability , leading to the observed macroscopic chirality .",
    "this appears to be analogous to the manner in which crystalline anisotropy leads to the observed symmetry of snowflakes @xcite ; more about this later .",
    "exhibits a wealth of different patterns according to the growth conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.14 ] ) . as for ,",
    "the patterns are generally compact at high peptone levels and become ramified ( fractal ) at low peptone levels . at very high peptone levels and high agar concentration , conceals its chiral nature and exhibits branching growth similar to that of .",
    "below 0.5% agar concentration the exhibits compact growth with density variations .",
    "these patterns are almost indistinguishable from those developed by the . in the range of 0.4%-0.6% agar concentration",
    "the exhibits its most complex patterns ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.16 ] ) . surprisingly , these patterns are composed of chiral branches of both left and right handedness .",
    "microscopic observations reveal that part of the growth is on top of the agar surface while in other parts the growth is in the agar .",
    "our model of the chiral growth explains that indeed growth on top of the surface and in the agar should lead to opposite handedness .",
    "optical microscope observations indicate that during growth of strong chirality the cells move within a well defined envelope .",
    "the cells are long relative to those of , and the movement appears correlated in orientation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2.17 ] ) .",
    "each branch tip maintains its shape , and at the same time the tips keep twisting with specific handedness while propagating .",
    "electron microscope observations do not reveal any chiral structure on the cellular membrane @xcite .",
    "in the course of evolution , bacteria have developed ingenious ways of moving on surfaces .",
    "the most widely studied and perhaps the most sophisticated translocation mechanism used by bacteria is the flagellum @xcite , but other mechanisms exist as well @xcite .",
    "swimming is a solitary movement done in liquid .",
    "a swimming bacterium runs nearly straight runs , interrupted by short periods of tumbling .",
    "tumbling event is a random rotation in one location .",
    "the direction of the next run is dictated by the final orientation of the tumbling bacterium .    a swimming bacterium propagates itself by rotating a bundle of flagella .",
    "each flagellum is an helical protein filament which is hooked to a molecular engine transversing the bacterial membrane .",
    "the engines of all flagella rotate synchronously clockwise or counterclockwise .",
    "when the bacterium turn them counterclockwise , the flagella form an aligned bundle and push the bacterium forward .",
    "when they turn clockwise , the flagella disjoin and the bacterium tumbles .    in our experiments , the bacteria do not swim in a pre - supplied liquid , but in a layer of fluid on the surface of the agar .",
    "the bacterial cells move individually and at random in the same manner as flagellated bacteria move in wet mounts ( i.e. , nearly straight runs separated by brief tumbling ) .",
    "swimming takes place only in sufficiently thick surface fluid .",
    "microscope observations reveal no organized flow - field pattern .    based on microscope observations of movement and electron microscope observations of flagella",
    "we identify the movement of and as swimming .",
    "cells tumble about every @xmath3 depending on external conditions .",
    "the speed of the bacterium between tumbling events is very sensitive to conditions such as the liquid viscosity , temperature and ph level .",
    "typically , it is of the order of 1 - 10@xmath4 .",
    "swimming can be approximated by a random walk with variable step size @xcite . at low bacterial densities",
    "the random walk can be described by a diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "low bacterial densities means that the mean free path between bacterial collisions @xmath6 is longer than the tumbling length @xmath7 , thus collisions between the bacteria can be neglected .",
    "the mean free path ( or collision length ) is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the 3d bacterial density and @xmath10 is the 2d density  the projection of @xmath9 on the surface .    at high densities ( @xmath11 ) , the collisions can not be neglected . in attempt to approximate the dynamics in those conditions",
    ", one may want to consider the time of straight motion to be @xmath12 instead of @xmath13 .",
    "hence @xmath14 depends on the bacterial density to yield @xmath15 this approximation is valid under the assumptions that a collision event is identical to a tumbling event ( abrupt uncorrelated change in direction of motion ) , that a tumbling event is independent of the collisions , and that the speed between such events is not affected by their frequency .",
    "the assumption that a collision event is like a tumbling event poses many problems .",
    "even if the bacteria do not activate special response to collision it is unrealistic to assume that collisions are elastic , or that the flagella adopt immediately to the new orientation which changes during collisions .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume strong correlation between the cell s orientation before collision and the cell s orientation after collision .",
    "in addition , the orientation after the collision should be biased according with the average direction of motion of the surrounding bacteria , as they carry the liquid with them .",
    "the important parameter is not the collision length @xmath6 but re - orientation time @xmath16 .",
    "the re - orientation time is the time it takes a bacterium to loose memory of its initial orientation , i.e. the time span on which the final orientation has effectively no correlation with the initial orientation . at low densities",
    "the re - orientation time @xmath16 is equal to the tumbling time @xmath17 . as the density rises and the collisions become more frequent , @xmath16 decrease .",
    "@xmath18 defines the densities above which the constant diffusion coefficient @xmath19 is not a good approximation .",
    "it is quite possible that these densities are high enough so as to make the velocity and even the type of motion dependent on bacterial density , making relation ( [ eq : hige_density_diffusion:0 ] ) irrelevant . in any case",
    ", high cellular densities does mean an effective decrease in the diffusion coefficient related to the bacterial movement .",
    "when swimming in an unstirred liquid , very low cellular densities also effect the movement .",
    "the bacteria secrete various materials into the media and some of them , e.g. enzymes and other polymers , significantly change the physical properties of the liquid making it more suitable for bacterial swimming .",
    "the secretion of these materials depend on cellular density , thus at not - too - high densities the speed of swimming rise with the cellular density .",
    "hence the diffusion coefficient related to the bacterial movement should be a non - monotonic function of the bacterial density .",
    "moreover , the specific functional form might depend on the specific bacterial strain .",
    "in other conditions there is similar but more pronounced effect . on semi - solid surface",
    "the bacteria can not swim at all inside the agar and they have to produce their own layer of liquid to swim in it . to produce such fluid the bacteria secrete lubricant ( wetting agents ) .",
    "other bacterial species produce known extracellular lubricants ( such as surfactants , see @xcite and references therein , or the extracellular slime produced by @xcite ) .",
    "these are various materials ( various cyclic lipopeptides were identified ) which draw water from the agar",
    ". the composition and properties of the lubricant of is not known , but we will assume that higher concentration of lubricant is needed to extract water from a dryer agar , and that the lubricant is slowly absorbed into the agar ( or decomposes ) .",
    "a single bacterium on the agar surface can not produce enough fluid to swim in it , thus the bacteria can not break out of the layer fluid and the branches of a or colony can be defined by this fluid .",
    "whenever bacteria enter the shallower parts of the layer , at the edge of the branch , they become sluggish , indicating that the depth of the layer effects the bacterial movement .",
    "it can be argued ( see section [ nonlinear ] ) that in such cases the bacterial speed is related to the bacterial density by a power law ( at least in low densities ) . not only the diffusion coefficient related to the bacterial movement is a non - monotonic function of the bacterial density ( as in a liquid agar ) , but it is also vanishes for extremely low densities . in this case",
    "it is clear that the specific functional form depend on the specific bacterial strain ( - , for example , can not move at all under such conditions ) .",
    "chemotaxis means changes in the movement of the bacteria in response to a gradient of certain chemical field @xcite .",
    "the movement is biased along the gradient either in the gradient direction or in the opposite direction .",
    "usually chemotactic response means a response to an externally produced field , like in the case of chemotaxis towards food .",
    "however , the chemotactic response can be also to a field produced directly or indirectly by the bacterial cells",
    ". we will refer to this case as chemotactic signaling .",
    "the bacteria sense the local concentration @xmath20 of a chemical by membrane receptors binding the chemical s molecules @xcite .",
    "it is crucial to note that when estimating gradients of chemicals , the bacterial cells actually measure changes in the receptors occupancy and not in the concentration itself .",
    "when put in continuous equations @xcite , this indirect measurement translates to measuring the gradient @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant whose value depends on the receptors affinity , the speed in which the bacterium processes the signal from the receptor , etc .",
    "this means that the chemical gradient times a factor @xmath23 is measured , and it is known as the `` receptor law '' @xcite .    in a continuous model",
    ", we incorporate the effect of chemotaxis by introducing a chemotactic flux @xmath24 : @xmath25 @xmath26 is the gradient sensed by the bacteria ( with @xmath27 having the units of 1 over chemical s concentration ) .",
    "@xmath28 is usually taken to be either constant or the `` receptor law '' .",
    "@xmath29 is the bacterial response to the sensed gradient ( having the same units as a diffusion coefficient times the units of the bacterial density @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is positive for attractive chemotaxis and negative for repulsive chemotaxis .",
    "ben - jacob argued @xcite that for the colonial adaptive self - organization the bacteria employ three kinds of chemotactic responses , each dominant in different regime of the morphology diagram ( the claim was made for , but the same hold for their relatives ) .",
    "one response is the food chemotaxis mentioned above .",
    "it is expected to be dominant for only a range of nutrient levels ( see the `` receptor law '' below ) .",
    "the two other kinds of chemotactic responses are signaling chemotaxis .",
    "one is long - range repulsive chemotaxis .",
    "the repelling chemical is secreted by starved bacteria at the inner parts of the colony .",
    "the second signal is a short - range attractant .",
    "the length scale of each signal is determined by the diffusion constant of the chemical agent and the rate of its spontaneous decomposition .",
    "_ amplification of diffusive instability due to nutrients chemotaxis : _ in non - living systems , more ramified patterns ( lower fractal dimension ) are observed for lower growth velocity .",
    "based on growth velocity as function of nutrient level and based on growth dynamics , ben - jacob @xcite concluded that in the case of bacterial colonies there is a need for mechanism that can both increase the growth velocity and maintain , or even decrease , the fractal dimension .",
    "they suggested food chemotaxis to be the required mechanism .",
    "it provides an outward drift to the cellular movements ; thus , it should increase the rate of envelope propagation . at the same time , being a response to an external field it should also amplify the basic diffusion instability of the nutrient field .",
    "hence , it can support faster growth velocity together with a ramified pattern of low fractal dimension .    _ repulsive chemotactic signaling : _ [ sec : repulsive ] we focus now on the formation of the fine radial branching patterns at low nutrient levels . from the study of non - living systems",
    ", it is known that in the same manner that an external diffusion field leads to the diffusion instability , an internal diffusion field will stabilize the growth .",
    "it is natural to assume that some sort of chemotactic agent produces such a field . to regulate the organization of the branches",
    ", it must be a long - range signal . to result in radial branches it must be a repulsive chemical produced by bacteria at the inner parts of the colony . the most probable candidates are the bacteria entering a pre - spore stage .",
    "if nutrient is deficient for a long enough time , bacterial cells may enter a special stationary state  a state of a spore  which enables them to survive much longer without food . while the spores themselves do not emit any chemicals ( as they have no metabolism ) , the pre - spores ( sporulating cells ) do not move and emit a very wide range of waste materials , some of which unique to the sporulating cell . these emitted chemicals might be used by other bacteria as a signal carrying information about the conditions at the location of the pre - spores .",
    "jacob @xcite suggested that such materials are repelling the bacteria ( repulsive chemotactic signaling ) as if they escape a dangerous location .",
    "- , like most bacteria , reproduce by fission of the cell into two daughter cells which are practically identical to the mother cell .",
    "the crucial step in the cell division is the replication of the genetic material and its sharing between the daughter cells .",
    "haste replication of dna might lead to many errors  most organisms limit the rate of replication to about 1000 bases per second .",
    "thus the reproduction must take at least minimal reproduction time @xmath31 .",
    "this reproduction time @xmath31 is about @xmath32 in bacilli .    for reproduction , as well as for movement and other metabolic processes , bacteria and all other organisms need influx of energy .",
    "any organism which does not get its energy directly from sunlight ( by photo - synthesis ) needs an external supply of food . in",
    "the patterning experiments the bacteria eat nutrient from the agar .",
    "as long as there is enough nutrient and no significant amount of toxic materials , food is consumed ( for cell replication and internal processes ) at maximal rate @xmath33 . to estimate @xmath33 we assume that a bacterium needs to consume an amount of food @xmath34 of about @xmath35 .",
    "it is 3 times its weight  one quanta for doubling body mass , one quanta used for movement and all other metabolic processes during the reproduction time @xmath36 , and one quanta is for the reduced entropy of making organized cell out of food .",
    "hence @xmath37 is about 2@xmath38 ( 1@xmath39gram ) .",
    "if nutrient is deficient for a long enough period of time , the bacterial cells may enter a special stationary state  a state of a spore  which enables them to survive much longer without food .",
    "the bacterial cells employ very complex mechanisms tailored for the process of sporulation .",
    "they stop normal activity  like movement  and use all their internal reserves to metamorphose from an active volatile cell to a sedentary durable seed. while the spores themselves do not emit any chemicals ( as they have no metabolism ) , the pre - spores ( sporulating cells , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2.10 ] ) do not move and emit a very wide range of wast e materials , some of which unique to the sporulating cell .",

    "when bacteria are grown in a petri dish , nutrients are usually provided by adding peptone , a mixture including all the amino acids and sugars as source of carbon .",
    "bacteria which are not defective in synthesis of any amino acid can grow also on a minimal agar in which a single source of carbon and no amino acids are provided .",
    "such growth might seem to be easier to model as the growth is limited by the diffusion of a single chemical .",
    "however , during growth on minimal agar there is usually a higher rate of waste products accumulation , introducing other complications into the model .",
    "moreover many of our strains are auxotrophic i.e. defective in synthesis of some amino acids and need an external supply of it .",
    "providing the bacteria with these amino acids and only a single carbon source might pose us the question as to what is the limiting factor in the growth of the bacteria .",
    "for all those reasons we prefer to use peptone as nutrient source .",
    "we said that if there is ample supply of food , bacteria reproduce in a maximal rate of one division in @xmath40 .",
    "if the available amount of food is limited , bacteria consume the maximum amount of food they can . in the limit of low bacterial density ,",
    "the available amount of food over the tumbling time @xmath13 is the food contained in the area @xmath41 , where @xmath14 and @xmath42 are the diffusion coefficients of the bacteria and the food , respectively .",
    "hence the rate of food consumption is given by @xmath43 ( weather @xmath14 is constant or not ) .    in a continuous model , reproduction of bacteria",
    "translate to a growth term of the bacterial density which is @xmath10 times the eating rate per bacteria . in the limit of high nutrient",
    "it is @xmath44 , and in the limit of low nutrient it is proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "this brings to mind michaelis - menten law @xcite of @xmath46 with @xmath47 constants .",
    "many authors take only the low nutrient limit of this expression , @xmath48 , although it is not biologically established that the bacteria in the experiments are limited by the availability of food and not by their maximal consumption rate .",
    "the lubricating bacteria model is a reaction - diffusion model for the bacterial colonies of the @xcite .",
    "this model includes four coupled fields .",
    "one field describes the bacterial density @xmath49 , the second describes the height of lubrication layer in which the bacteria swim @xmath50 , a third field describes the nutrients @xmath51 and the fourth field is the stationary bacteria that `` freeze '' and begin to sporulate @xmath52 ( see section [ sec : repulsive ] ) .",
    "we first describe the dynamics of the bacteria and of the nutrient .",

    "the spinors , like the bacteria , can not modulate their runs as a function of the difference between their direction and that of the gradient ; they do not know what is the direction of the gradient , only the directional derivative along their path .",
    "as was demonstrated in figure [ fig : cmodel : weak ] , one of the key features for the weak chirality in the spinors model is the correlation in orientation of the spinors ( through @xmath129 ) .",
    "in fact in this model the twist of the branches stems from the deviation of the runs direction from the orientation of neighboring spinors .",
    "the twist of the branches is related only indirectly , through the neighbors orientation , to the chemorepellent s gradient .",
    "a continuous model of such process should include information about the mean orientation of the bacterial cells .",
    "it should include chemotaxis without rotation , anisotropic diffusion ( smaller diffusion coefficient in orientations orthogonal to the mean orientation of neighbors ) and a rotation on the diffusion operator .",
    "such a model will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the discrete spinors model allows for a detailed representation of the bacterial properties .",
    "the macroscopic dynamics and resulting patterns , however , are similar in both models  apparently the growth does not amplify the difference in the microscopic dynamics",
    ". thus the ` unrealistic ' microscopic description of the non - linear diffusion model does not rule it out as an approximation to the growth dynamics of bacterial colonies with weak chirality .",
    "all through this manuscript we referred to chirality as a two - valued property  either the pattern is chiral or it is not .",
    "there are various attempts in the literature to quantify chirality with a continuous measure .",
    "see for example the method of avnir @xcite , who applied their method also to large disordered objects . while this method is general and",
    "can quantify with a single number the measure of asymmetry of any given object , it is not quite satisfactory for our purpose .",
    "we would like to know the time evolution of the chirality of a colony , and not just `` mean '' chirality given by a single number .",
    "we sacrifice the generality of the measure to that end .",
    "since the growth velocity of the colonies ( both experimental and simulated ) is constant , we measure the chirality as a function of radius instead of function of time .",
    "thus we can work on chirality of an image , not of a process .",
    "the image can be a scanned picture of the real colony or a result of a computer simulation .",
    "we look for a mapping of the image to a new one , which in some sense does not distinguish left from right ( the ambiguity stems from the fact that a large random object will not have , in general , reflection symmetry , thus there is no trivial definition for chirality of such objects ) .",
    "the mapping is defined by : @xmath172 where each point in the image is described by the polar coordinates @xmath173 , measured from the center of the colony .",
    "thus , each point is rotated by an increment @xmath174 which depends on the radius @xmath175 ( i.e. the distance from the center ) .    working on many experimental patterns , as well as simulated patterns ,",
    "we have learned that in most cases a linear dependence of @xmath176 on @xmath175 is sufficient to give quite satisfactory results , that is , to transform a chiral pattern into a `` normal '' branching pattern .",
    "the rotating angle is thus written : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the radius of the colony , and @xmath179 is the rotation angle at that radius .",
    "the fact that this linear angular mapping suffices to `` de - chiral '' the simulated patterns may not be of much importance ( in the case of the continuous model , at least , this is almost a direct result of the way in which we introduce the weak chirality ) .",
    "the same transformation works for images of real colonies of , but _ does not _",
    "work for chiral colonies of other bacteria ( see sec . [",
    "sec : conc ] ) .",
    "this strengthens our belief in the models .",
    "we first briefly reviewed experimental observations of colonial patterns formed by bacteria of the species .",
    "we described both the tip - splitting growth of the and the chiral , twisted - branches growth of .",
    "both colonial patterns and optical microscope observations of the bacteria dynamics were presented .    in this manuscript we presented observations of various forms of chiral patterns in bacterial colonies .",
    "our goal was to explain the various aspects of chirality .",
    "we used two types of models : continuous reaction - diffusion models which deal with bacterial density , and a hybrid semi - discrete model which deals with properties of the individual bacterium . from a comparison of the models simulation and experimental observations",
    "we conclude that chemotactic signaling plays an important part in the development of colonies of the two types .",
    "we also estimate how sensitive the growth is to the details of the microscopic dynamics , demonstrating that the more complex the pattern is , the more sensitive the growth is to the small details .",
    "we would like to note that the is not the only bacteria whose colonies exhibit chirality .",
    "ben - jacob discussed in @xcite the formation of colonies of , where each branch is produced by a leading droplet and emits side branches , each with its own leading droplet .",
    "each leading droplet consists of hundreds to millions of bacterial cells that circle a common center ( a vortex ) at a cellular speed of about @xmath180 m/s . in fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] we show a colonial pattern of these bacteria .",
    "the chirality we termed ` weak chirality ' is evident in this figure . in this case",
    "the chirality is not related to the handedness of the flagella , but to the rotation of the vortices .",
    "when `` pushed '' by repulsive chemotaxis , magnus force acts on the vortices and drive them side - ways from the radial direction of the chemorepellent s gradient .",
    "this difference in mechanisms is expressed in the global pattern : the colonial patterns of can not be `` de - chiraled '' by the transformation ( linear angular mapping ) that `` de - chiral '' the .",
    "the fact that the models for weak chirality match in this respect the the weak chirality of and not the ` weak chirality ' of is another support for their success in describing the bacterial colonies .",
    "we hope we have convinced the reader that chirality in patterns of bacterial colonies gives important clues about the underlying dynamics .",
    "the processes leading to such patterns are more complex than those leading to non - twisted branching patterns .",
    "the chiral patterns are more sensitive to the underlying dynamics and as such they require more accurate models .",
    "this reflects on the success of the models we presented as being a good description of the colonies .",
