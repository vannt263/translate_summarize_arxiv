    "the link between flows with singularities and polygonal billiards is given in @xcite .",
    "in said work a flow on a compact surface is constructed from any given rational polygonal billiard and fixed direction .",
    "the equilibrium points of the flow are singularities of saddle type associated with the corners of the polygon .",

    "it states that a flow on a compact surface , in the absence of singularities of saddle type of index 0 , is expansive if and only if the singularities are of saddle type and the union of their separatrices is dense in the surface . roughly speaking",
    "the proof is the following .",
    "take two points in different local orbits , consider a separatrix between them and follow them until the end of the separatrix .",
    "the separation occurs because the singularity is of saddle type of negative index . to prove the converse the key step is to show that there are no wandering points .",
    "the rest of the argument is quite standard .",

    "we introduce the definition of expansive flow and show the equivalence with the definition of @xmath0-expansive given in @xcite .",

    "it is known that the interval and the circle do not admit expansive homeomorphisms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless it is easy to prove that expansive flows on those spaces are the ones with a finite number of singular points . in particular this",
    "shows that expansive flows can posses saddle connections .",
    "in fact , example [ bitoroexp ] shows that there exist expansive flows with cycles of saddle connections that disconnect the surface . in theorem [ structure ]",
    "we give a procedure to construct every expansive flow on a compact surface , the procedure is : suspend some minimal interval exchange maps , add singularities of index 0 , make cuts along saddle connections and glue them .",

    "section 9 . as an application and a source of examples of expansive flows on surfaces we consider rational polygonal billiards . as explained in @xcite such billiard flows can be seen on a compact surface and fixing a direction @xmath8 a flow is determined presenting singularities of saddle type in the corners .",
