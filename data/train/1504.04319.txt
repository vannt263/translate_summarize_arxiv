    "a good deal of current research on the operation of _ smart grids _ has been focused on the information structures and protocols that enable operation , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . to facilitate load management at the level of a residential or commercial building microgrid , the authors have proposed the concept of packetized direct load control ( pdlc ) . here the term packetized refers to a fixed time energy usage authorization , with the emphasis being on usage by thermostatic appliances ( water heaters , refrigerators , air conditioners , etc . )",
    "that have been aggregated into pools defined by common operating characteristics .",
    "taking hvac , for example , consumers in each room in a building choose their preferred set point , and then an operator ( _ smart building operator _ , sbo ) of the local appliance pool will determine an appropriate comfort band around the set point .",
    "our previous work has shown that pdlc is capable of ensuring consumer comfort while at the same time reducing power oscillations that occur when no control is applied and appliances operate independently , @xcite .    while packet - switched energy distribution protocols appear to have numerous advantages in controlling demand oscillations from predictable loads , open questions remain concerning the operation of small - scale distribution networks in which multiple distributed generation ( dg ) sources inject power with hard - to - predict intermittency . in such settings ,",
    "stable and secure grid operation will be increasingly challenged by non - radial distribution network topologies in which lines connecting loads and power sources are opened and closed according to arrays of factors including weather , time - of - day , and real - time energy market conditions .    focusing the discussion on network topology control , section ii begins with a review of _ braess paradox _ in transportation networks .",
    "section iii focuses on an analogous phenomenon in a voltage controlled circuit .",
    "here it is shown that changing the circuit topology by adding a small load can lead to relatively large losses in the circuit as a whole .",
    "section iv discusses similar sensitivity in optimal power flows within a simple non - radial distribution grid .",
    "section v extends the analysis of section iii to voltage - controlled circuits of arbitrary size .",
    "open problems are discussed in section vi .",
    "the principal challenge addressed here is the management of network congestion in the presence of load and dg ( distributed generation ) uncertainties .",
    "we begin by recalling the well known braess paradox that is generally associated with congestion in transportation networks .",
    "the setup , in simple form , is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : jb : braess ] .",
    "there is a network ( of roads ) with an origin _ o _ and destination _ d_. a certain number of travelers will make the journey , and in the network in fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : braess](a ) they have a choice of the route with segments @xmath0 or segments @xmath1 .",
    "congestion may enter either route in terms of travel times that depend on the number of users traveling on each segment .",
    "if @xmath2 denotes the number of voyagers on the segment , the travel times on segments @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the same and equal to @xmath5 for some constant @xmath6 .",
    "the travel times on segments @xmath7 and @xmath8 are similarly equal to @xmath9 for some positive @xmath10 .",
    "there are many different values of the parameters used in the literature , but the basic idea is that because the left - hand and right - hand routes in fig .  [",
    "fig : jb : braess ] have the same congestion cost , @xmath11 , introducing the cross link will break the cost symmetry and could cause the cost of travel to increase . taking the particular values of @xcite : @xmath12 , and letting the total number of travelers be @xmath13 , we find that without the cross link , the best choice for minimizing travel time is for three of the travelers to choose the left - hand route and three to choose the right hand route .",
    "this is a nash equilibrium .",
    "the travel time for each traveler is @xmath14 .",
    "when the no - cost cross link is present , however , travelers will observe a possibly shorter route given by following the segments @xmath8-cross - link-@xmath7 . indeed ,",
    "if only three of the six travelers took this route , the travel cost could be as low as @xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , all six travelers may choose the route , in which case , the cost becomes @xmath16 .",
    "taking the cost to be travel - time , braess paradox is that adding a delay - free travel link can actually increase congestion and the users travel time .",
    "braess paradox in this setting involves selfish social choices .",
    "there is a similar apparent paradox in electric circuits , as noted by cohen and horowitz ( @xcite ) that is a consequence of the laws of electrophysics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : circuit ] , the question immediately arises as to how the horizontal connection changes the characteristics of the circuit on the top and bottom links . specifically",
    ", suppose that @xmath17 .",
    "elementary invocation of kirchhoff s current and voltage laws indicates that in the absence of the horizontal link , the currents @xmath18 and @xmath19 will be equal , but if the link is added with a moderate value of the resistance @xmath20 , we will have @xmath21 .",
    "this change is not surprising and is consistent with the observation in @xcite that introducing the path changes the voltage drop across the circuit .",
    "it is also consistent with the observations in @xcite,@xcite that adding this link may worsen congestion in similar models of power grid interconnections .",
    "the interesting question posed in @xcite and @xcite is whether ( and when ) there is a useful tradeoff in grid design that balances the increased reliability of larger numbers of power lines against the congestion that may occur due to adding these lines to the network . in what follows ,",
    "we study a related question of when congestion may unexpectedly occur in a distribution network under the pdlc protocols described in @xcite@xcite .        historically , distribution networks have had radial topologies , with distribution lines leading from a single trunk or power source to various commercial and residential loads .",
    "this standard topology is likely to change with the ever increasing penetration of distributed generation in the form of wind , solar , plug - in electric vehicles , and many other forms of alternative energy .",
    "microgrids as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : distribution ] will become prevalent , and these will increasingly resemble miniaturized transmission networks in which sources and loads will be connected through a multiplicity of line links that can be opened and closed as needed to maintain the needed balance between capacity and demand . it is against this backdrop that we examine the question of how the increased penetration of spatially distributed generation together with new electricity market models aimed at managing demand response will challenge the operating security of microgrid distribution networks .",
    "recent work has demonstrated how various communication protocols can be effectively employed in networks of smart microgrids to improve energy efficiency , decrease demand volatility , and ensure customer satisfaction@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "although this work has examined packet switched energy delivery in terms of temporal uncertainty in the operation of microgrids , the effects of spatial and network topology variability and uncertainty of both demand and dg capacity is not well understood .",
    "while the precise magnitude of costs associated with mitigating the uncertainties of renewable generation sources is not known , some estimates suggest that higher reserve margins will be required . for instance , the historical averages of reserve requirements in the power grid point to 7% to 8% as generally sufficient to handle contingencies .",
    "there are now predictions that if renewable penetration gets to the 33% level ( still a long way off ) these requirements may go as high as 15% , @xcite .",
    "the implications of renewables for transmission networks remains a work in progress . with the increasing likelihood",
    "that distribution networks will incorporate small - scale distributed generation as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : distribution ] , we turn to the question of how these intermittent sources will affect network congestion on a small scale",
    ". our working definition of congestion will be in terms of fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : circuit ] , where we say that there is congestion if there is a significant difference between currents @xmath18 and @xmath19 and more importantly , between the energy losses due to heat @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we note that if there is no horizontal link ( i.e. if @xmath24 or equivalently , if @xmath25 ) , then @xmath26 , and if @xmath27 , the heat losses at each resistor are equal as well .",
    "these conclusions remain true irrespective of the magnitudes of the voltage sources .",
    "if @xmath27 and the voltage sources happen to be equal in magnitude , then @xmath24 no matter what value is assigned to @xmath20 . if there is any imbalance in the voltages @xmath28 and @xmath29 , or if one of them is zero ( think of a wind turbine or solar array being out of service due to weather conditions ) , then a small value of @xmath20 on the cross link of fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : circuit ] can produce a very large difference in the currents @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we summarize this in the following :    suppose @xmath30 and that @xmath31 . then if the cross link is not connected in fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : circuit ] we have that @xmath32 while if the cross _ is _ connected and @xmath33 is positive but small , we have @xmath34 . moreover , the total heat loss across across the entire circuit is approximately twice the loss if the cross link is disconnected .",
    "a simple application of kirchhoff s circuit laws shows that the currents @xmath35 are related to the circuit voltages and resistances by relationships that are linear in the voltages but subtly nonlinear in the resistances .",

    "[ fig : jb : circuit ] is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jb : circuitplotcurrent ] .",
    "connecting the link with a very small resistance @xmath20 brings the current @xmath18 to essentially zero , while doubling the current @xmath19 .",
    "it is not surprising that the losses on the line through which @xmath19 flows increase dramatically .",
    "it is also the case that the total losses for the circuit double when the connection is made .    .",
    "the magenta line indicates the per unit current values @xmath18,@xmath19 when the cross is not present .",
    "the red , blue , and green curves are the values of the currents @xmath18,@xmath19 , and @xmath38 ( as functions of the resistance @xmath20 ) when the cross link is connected .",
    "@xmath39 in all cases . ]",
    "the _ loss cost of the link _ ( lcl ) is defined as the ratio between the total network losses before and after the addition of a new link or other capacity enhancement . denoting the system losses before and after the capacity enhancement as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43    the lcl concept is our version of the _ price of anarchy _ that is discussed in routing congestion problems in transportation networks , @xcite .",
    "proposition 1 shows that the lcl for the balanced load network with @xmath27 is 2 .",
    "the following corollary extends the result to imbalanced networks of parallel connected resistors .",
    "suppose @xmath44 , if the cross link is connected and @xmath20 is positive but small , then the price of anarchy of the kirchhoff - braess network is @xmath45    based on kirchhoff s circuit law , the current @xmath35 that flows through the resistor @xmath46 are @xmath47 the total system loss for small value of @xmath48 is @xmath49 on the other hand , the system loss before adding @xmath20 is @xmath50 from the above two equations , we have the lcl is @xmath51 this ends the proof of proposition 1 .",
    "a general scenario for proposition 1 is to consider that two voltage sources are connected in the opposite direction at the same time , namely both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are non - zero . in typical distribution networks ,",
    "the level of voltage is the same , say 110v at the user level .",
    "therefore a much more complex electric network with the same level of voltage sources can be equivalently transformed into the network of two voltage sources connected in the opposite direction with a series connected to an equivalent resistor . in the following proposition , we show that the lcl will increase as the imbalance increases between the two resistors of the equivalent circuit .",

    "if we rewrite ( [ eq : jb : lcl ] ) in terms of @xmath60 or @xmath61 , a straightforward argument using elementary calculus and counting cases shows that for any @xmath62 , lcl is an increasing function of @xmath63    in decision theory , it is frequently desirable to base decisions on criteria that are known ( or can be proven ) to be monotonic in the decision variables .",
    "the previous section showed that if there is a lack of balance in the voltage source distribution that large current imbalances ( congestion ) can occur . in this section",
    ", we note that if there are imbalances in the resistances in our model network , then there will be a non - monotonic dependence of the losses @xmath22 and @xmath23 on the magnitude of the resistance @xmath20 .    referring to the circuit of fig .",

    "[ fig : jb : powerflow ] .",
    "we examine a dc power flow model of the three bus network in which bus 1 and bus 2 are generators , while bus 3 is a load .",
    "the production costs of operating the generators are @xmath78 for @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the nodal power injection at the @xmath81-th bus .",
    "these costs of generation are convex functions , reflecting the fact that as the power increases , the incremental cost rises superlinearly due to wear and tear on the machinery , decreased efficiency margins .",
    "the `` elastic price '' load at bus 3 is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the inelastic component of the load and @xmath84 is the `` price elastic '' component of the load .",

    "the nodal power injections always sum to zero , as do the columns and rows of @xmath96 , and since the power flow equations are invariant under a common phase shift of the @xmath91 s it is convenient to choose a reference bus ( say bus 1 ) at which we set the phase angle @xmath97 .",
    "the _ optimal power flow _",

    "this solution must be the same as what would have been obtained by minimizing ( [ eq : jb : objective ] ) directly .",
    "it holds much more generally that for a connected power grid , the optimal power injections from generators is independent of the line conductances _ provided there is no congestion_. the proof is a direct extension of the above but is omitted due to space limitations .",
    "we instead examine the sensitivity of congestion to generation cost in the simple example at hand .",
    "adopting the cost functions of @xcite , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and recalling that @xmath115 , the optimal power injections are easily seen to satisfy @xmath116 clearly , the cost coefficients @xmath117 must be such that the power injections are within the ranges ( [ eq : jb : constraints])specifically the marginal value of consumer preference for load price elasticity must be in balance with the marginal costs of generation . to evaluate the line loading produced by the power injections ( [ eq : jb : powerinjection ] ) , we solve ( [ eq : jb : powerphase ] ) and use ( [ eq : jb : lineloads ] ) .",

    "the line loading between the less costly generator and the load ( @xmath121 ) turns out to be a monotonically increasing function of the conductance @xmath122 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if @xmath122 is small enough in relation to @xmath123 , the line loading will have @xmath124 . and",
    "the load will draw more power from the line to the more expensive generator @xmath125 .",
    "write the phase and line - loading relationship in matrix form : @xmath126 , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 is the matrix representation specified by ( [ eq : jb : lineloads ] ) :    @xmath129 we can then express the line loadings directly in terms of the power injections by writing @xmath130 for small values of @xmath131 , this relationship is @xmath132 where @xmath133 . with the power injected by generator @xmath134 being shifted from line @xmath135 to lines @xmath136 and @xmath137 , it is reasonable to expect that congestion on these lines will be sensitive to changes in @xmath98 and generation cost parameter @xmath138 .",
    "indeed a straightforward calculation shows that there is extreme sensitivity to the cost parameter with @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a positive constant , and @xmath2 is a smooth function of @xmath131 .",
    "once an uncongested optimum power flow lies outside the operating range of any component ( [ eq : jb : constraints ] ) , the operating limit of that component becomes a binding constraint in terms of which the optimal power flow problem must be resolved .",
    "( see @xcite ) . rather than pursuing constrained optimal power flow at this point ,",
    "we briefly explore the pervasiveness of the kirchhoff - braess phenomena in larger networks .",
    "we shall consider the effect of attaching an arbitrary two - port voltage controlled circuit ( e.g.  a single resistor or single voltage source in the simplest cases ) to any two points of an existing voltage controlled circuit of arbitrary topology .",

    "we begin by recalling that a voltage controlled dc circuit is made up of resistors , capacitors , inductors , and voltage sources .",

    "then a fundamental node basis may be formed from the set of connected components of the given graph , by arbitrarily selecting one node from each connected component .",
    "since there exists at least one path comprised purely by voltage source links between every node pair in a connected component , we can easily get the voltage difference between the fundamental node and other nodes in that connected component by computing the algebraic sum of voltage sources on their connecting paths .",

    "[ kir ] must be zero for @xmath195 .",
    "the potential function thus reaches its global minimum loss level under normal operating conditions .",
    "we consider what happens if a new link ( two - port circuit ) is attached to any pair of nodes , if both endpoints of the newly introduced link are added to the same connected component of @xmath196 , defined above , then the total loss of the original circuit will remain the same as @xmath197 .",
    "however , if the two endpoints of the new link are added to two different connected components , say @xmath173 and @xmath198 , and if we denote the current flowing on the new link from @xmath173 to @xmath198 by @xmath199 , then we will have @xmath200 after adding the new link , the algebraic sum of all currents flowing on the original resistors that meet at the @xmath163-th connected component is determined by the current @xmath199 which is not necessarily zero as there may be current import and export to the newly added link from the original system .",
    "therefore the original loss equilibrium is perturbed away from its minimum level , and thus the system loss of the original system will have increased .",
    "this proves the proposition .",
    "the multi - node connected components of @xmath196 may have arbitrarily complex topologies  including tree and loop components .",
    "if a fundamental node basis that differs from the one chosen to define the loss in ( [ eq : jb : loss ] ) is chosen , the form of the loss function ( [ eq : jb : loss ] ) will differ accordingly .",
    "the critical point determined by setting the partial derivatives in ( [ kir ] ) equal to zero will minimize the new expression for loss .",
    "it follows from the kirchhoff circuit laws , that the minimizing values in both representations are the same  as we would expect .    a more general version of proposition [ prop : jb : resistance ] can be established .",
    "indeed , the proof as given applies to the connection any two - port voltage controlled circuit to an existing voltage controlled circuit in steady state . although the proof becomes more involved , a similar result holds for the addition of an @xmath201-port external circuit .",
    "it has long been recognized that contingencies like the loss of a major power line can pose significant threats to the secure operation of the power grid .",
    "the focus of this paper has been on the way that seemingly small changes can have large effects .",
    "we have presented examples of simple circuits and networks that display the kinds of sensitivity to small changes in operating parameters that will need to be better understood as smart microgrids become an increasingly important part of power distribution networks .",
    "secure operation of these microgrids will require the real - time coordinated control of increasing numbers of small - scale generation resources and consumer - provided demand response assets while respecting the safe operating ranges of all lines and equipment .",
    "taking inspiration from concepts of congestion in traffic networks , we have studied what we call kirchhoff - braess phenomena  the apparent worsening of congestion due to the addition of a lightly loaded line connecting points in the network .",
    "we have defined a power network analogue of the price of anarchy that we call the _ loss cost of the link _ ( lcl ) .",
    "this is simply the ratio of losses after and before the asset ( e.g.  a line ) has been added .",
    "it has been shown that this ratio is frequently greater than one , and this has been studied in detail for simple small networks and in considerable generality for voltage controlled networks in section vi .",
    "space does not permit treatment of current - controlled circuits , but a corresponding theory characterizes situations in which network losses increase and other situations in which there are decreases in network losses when a new circuit link is added .",
    "an important goal of future research is an understanding of general classes of optimal power flows in which the cost sensitivity of network congestion as treated in section v is extended to realistic transmission and distribution networks .",
    "models that capture degradation of voltage , frequency and other important physical parameters are being developed .",
    "the authors thank colleagues michael caramanis and justin foster for bringing braess paradox in distribution networks to their attention .",
