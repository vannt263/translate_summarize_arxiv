    "it is interesting to find that the topologies induced by this operator and by the sixth type of covering lower approximation operator are the same . in the third part , we study the conditions which make the first type of covering upper approximation operator be a closure operator , and find that the topology induced by the operator is different from the one induced by lower approximation operator . however , it is the same as the topology induced by the fifth type of covering upper approximation operator .",
