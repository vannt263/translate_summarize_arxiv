    "the braneworld scenarios that our observed four  dimensional universe can be considered as a brane embedded in a higher  dimensional space  time , can supply new insights for solving the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite and the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",

    "are described by fermions , localization of a bulk fermion is very important for any braneworld model @xcite . in general , if one does not introduce the coupling between the fermion and scalars which generate the thick braneworlds , a bulk fermion does not have a normalizable zero mode in five dimensions .",
    "so in order to localize a bulk fermion , the scalar  fermion coupling should be introduced .",
    "usually , the yukawa coupling @xmath4 is a natural choice when the scalar has the configuration of a kink ( i.e. , @xmath2 is an odd function of the extra dimensional coordinate ) .",

    "recently , liu et al . presented a new localization mechanism of a bulk fermion on braneworlds generated by such a scalar with even parity @xcite .",
    "the scalar  fermion coupling is given by @xmath5 , which ensures not only the @xmath7 reflection symmetry of the lagrange but also localization of the left or right  chiral fermion zero mode on the branes .    in this paper",

    "if only introducing the yukawa coupling , the effective potentials of the left and right  chiral fermion kaluza  klein ( kk ) modes in the corresponding schrdinger equations are modified volcano  type potentials .",
    "and the left and right  chiral fermion zero modes tend to a constant and infinity respectively , when far away from the brane .",

    "when both two couplings are considered , the potentials will have a barrier at each side of the brane , and tend to a positive constant when far away from the brane .",
    "then one of the left and right  chiral fermions zero modes can be localized on the brane , and there exists a mass gap in the mass spectra of the fermion kk modes . then the massive bound and/or resonant kk modes can be localized and/or quasilocalized on the brane .",

    "in this paper , localization and mass spectra of a bulk spin-@xmath0 fermion field on a thick brane generated by two scalar fields ( a kink scalar and a dilaton scalar ) in five dimensions have been investigated .    for localization of the fermion zero mode ,",
