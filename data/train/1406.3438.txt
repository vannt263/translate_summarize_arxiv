    "the existence of such localized state essentially shows the confinement effect of the geometry in quantum region .",
    "it is noted that the three - terminal - opening structure here is very different from the previously studied t - junction system,@xcite where only two terminals are open and the structure confinement is more like a kind of cavity confinement.@xcite very recently , xu _",
    "et al_. investigated the localized state in the three - terminal - opening t - shaped graphene nanoribbons.@xcite as reported , the existence of the localized state due to the t - shaped confinement provides the discrete channel to interfere with the directly propagating channels since the localized state embeds in the continuum .",
    "this typical interference , known as the fano - type interference,@xcite leads to a characteristic asymmetric line shape in the transmission . furthermore ,",
    "if one connects two infinity terminals in the cross - shaped structure , to shape a ring geometry , due to the topological similarity there should exist at least one localized state trapped at the intersection of ring and the attached wire .",
    "however , this localized state has not yet been studied in the literature .",
    "ring geometries , thanks to its special topological property , have attracted intensive attention.@xcite for example , electrons confined to a closed path pierced by a magnetic flux , manifest a phase coherence phenomenon : the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect,@xcite which has been experimentally observed both in metallic@xcite and semiconducting rings.@xcite in addition , in an analogous effect of the ab effect : the aharonov - casher effect,@xcite the phase coherence of electrons traveling through a closed path with spin - orbit interaction,@xcite has been experimentally demonstrated through a single@xcite and through an array of mesoscopic rings.@xcite topics , such as berry phase,@xcite spin - related conductance modulation,@xcite spin filters@xcite and detectors,@xcite spin rotation@xcite and spin switching mechanisms,@xcite have also been exploited intensively in ring geometries . however , up till now , the above mentioned localized state in a ring geometry attached to the wire has not yet drawn any attention .",
    "recent studies@xcite for a ring attached to the wire showed the existence of bound states , which are bounded in the ring but with small amplitude at the intersection and almost no amplitude along the wire .",
    "however , this kind of bound state is not the localized state as we mentioned above .",
    "moreover , these bound states have no coupling with the propagating states due to the symmetry.@xcite accordingly , no asymmetric fano line shape appears for this type of bound states .    in this work",
    ", we propose a scheme that uses a ring with a tangent connection to the wire as well as a magnetic flux threading the ring for modulation .",
    "we show that there exist localized states trapped at the intersection with energies lying below the each subband .",
    "the localized state embedded in the lower subband has a coupling with the continuum ones which leads to the fano - type interference .",
    "we find that this model can provide a large tunable energy gap in the transmission due to the interplay of the fano - type antiresonance and structure antiresonance .",
    "we further demonstrate that this energy gap is very robust against anderson disorder , making this proposal highly feasible for a real application .",

    "the wire is connected to the left / right leads with the same width @xmath1 through perfect ideal ohmic contacts .",
    "we describe the model by the tight - binding hamiltonian with the nearest - neighbor approximation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian of the entire ring , @xmath7 are the hamiltonian of the left , right leads and the wire except the part overlapping with the ring , respectively .",

    "in order to show that the existence of the localized state trapped at intersection is indeed due to the geometric confinement effect similar to the cross - shaped structure , we first study an one - dimensional model in sec .  [ results_a ] , which shows that there exists only one localized state trapped at the intersection with energy lying below the energy band .",
    "we then lift the energy of this localized state into the energy band by using an on - site gate voltage@xcite and obtain the fano asymmetric line shape in the transmission .",

    "[ results_b ] ) , due to the subband effect , there exist localized states trapped at the intersection with energies lying below the each subband .",
    "the transmission therefore is strongly modulated by the fano - type interference especially at the fano antiresonance due to the coupling between the localized state and the continuum ones .",
    "for the one - dimensional model ( @xmath22 ) , we take the ring size @xmath23 , i.e. , the ring contains 11 lattice points .",
    "the diagonalization of the one - dimensional structure hamiltonian @xmath24 shows that there exists only one localized state trapped at the intersection ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figyw2 ] ) with energy lying below the energy band . moreover , the energy of this localized state @xmath21 is around @xmath25 , which is close to the energy of the localized state in one - dimensional cross - shaped structure with the same on - site and hopping energy parameters.@xcite the transmission therefore only shows the oscillatory behavior due to the structure resonance and antiresonance as shown in fig .",
    "[ figyw3](a ) , where the transmission amplitude is plotted against the fermi energy @xmath21 in the absence of magnetic flux .",
    "moreover , the corresponding resonant energies in transmission , except the two outermost resonances which are close to the energy band edges , coincide with the eigenvalues of the isolated mesoscopic ring with the same size.@xcite the energies of the two outermost resonances are also very close to the eigenvalues of the isolated mesoscopic ring . in fig .",

    ", the diagonalization of the structure hamiltonian @xmath24 shows that there exist localized states trapped at the intersection with energies lying below the each subband . the states which we are interested in are the ones whose energies lying inside the lowest subband .",
    "we find that when the inner radius of the ring @xmath2 is one order of magnitude smaller than the width @xmath1 of the wire , there exists only one localized state trapped at the intersection with energy lying inside the first subband .",
    "however , with increasing the inner radius of the ring @xmath2 under the same width @xmath1 , two localized states appear in the first subband and tend to be degenerate .",
    "geometrically , the increase of the inner radius separates the two positions where the ring intersects into the wire , the intersection then gradually evolves into two small equivalent intersections of the t - shaped structure .",
    "the two localized states embedded in the first subband concentrate at these two intersections . since we are interested in the localized states due to the geometric confinement , we therefore concentrate on the case with small inner radius of the ring ( one order of magnitude smaller than the width @xmath1 of the wire ) .    in fig .",

    ", the coupling @xmath39 mainly comes from the region where the localized state concentrates and the localized state trapped at a larger region has a stronger coupling ( larger wave - function amplitude in the wire ) .",

    "the energy window we choose in the figure lies inside the first subband .",
    "one finds that the asymmetric fano line shape appears at the vicinity of @xmath37 .",
    "the position of the fano line shape coincides with the corresponding localized state obtained from the diagonalization .",
    "one observes that the magnetic flux has little effect on the position of the fano line shape but has a marked influence on its shape .",
    "this interesting modulation is caused by the shift of the structure resonance which has been demonstrated in the case of one - dimensional model in the previous subsection .",
    "when the fano dip is close to an antiresonance dip ( @xmath29 ) , a wide energy gap @xmath41 $ ] appears in the transmission ( see the red solid curve ) .",
    "moreover , this gap can be turned off via tuning the magnetic flux . specifically , when the fano dip is close to a resonance peak ( @xmath28 ) , a sharp dip with a sharp peak nearby appears in the transmission and a large transmission amplitude @xmath42 is obtained for the gap window @xmath41 $ ] ( see the blue dotted curve ) .",
    "this feature demonstrates that the energy gap can be turned off or on by tuning the magnetic flux .",
    "therefore , this model can work as a transistor with on and off features by tuning the magnetic flux .",
    "we now show the feasibility of the above proposed model for a real application by analyzing the robustness of the energy gap against the anderson disorder . in our simulation ,",
    "the anderson disorder is introduced by generating random on - site energies at the structure sites : @xmath43 in eq .",

    "[ figyw6](a ) against the fermi energy in the vicinity of the energy gap with different anderson disorder strengths @xmath40 .",
    "one finds that the vanishingly small transmission amplitudes in the gap window @xmath41 $ ] become larger as the disorder strength @xmath40 increases .",
    "but even for the very large disorder strength @xmath46 , the corresponding transmission amplitudes for the gap window are still smaller than @xmath47 , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the  on \" transmission amplitudes @xmath48 as mentioned above . for comparison , we also show the robustness of an ordinary antiresonance ( with the energy window @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath29 ) without a fano antiresonance nearby in fig .",
    "[ figyw6](b ) .",
    "the transmission amplitudes in this energy window rapidly increase with the strength of the disorder .",
    "specifically , they already reach over @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the transistors only based on the structure antiresonance are very weak against the disorder .     _ vs _ fermi energy of the leads with different inner radii @xmath2 of the ring when @xmath36 and @xmath52 . , width=309 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figyw7 ] , we plot the transmission amplitudes against the fermi energy for the system with @xmath36 and @xmath52 but with different inner radii @xmath2 , one observes that the asymmetric fano antiresonance dip which appears in transmission when @xmath53 ( see the red solid curve ) gradually fades away with increasing the inner radius of the ring under the same width @xmath36 .",
    "especially , when @xmath54 under the same width @xmath36 , this dip in transmission is barely visible and two sharp resonance peaks appear ( see the pink chain curve ) . as mentioned above , under the same width @xmath1 , the increase of the inner radius separates the intersection into two small ones and there appear two localized states each trapped at a small intersection . since the strength of the coupling @xmath39 between the localized state @xmath55 and the continuum ones @xmath3 depends on the area of the localized region , these two localized states trapped at the small intersection therefore have weak couplings with the continuum ones , leading to two sharp resonance peaks in the transmission",
    "in summary , we have extended a special kind of localized state trapped at the intersection due to the geometric confinement , first proposed in a three - terminal - opening t - shaped structure,@xcite into a ring geometry with a tangent connection to the wire .",
    "this kind of the localized states has long been overlooked in the ring geometry attached to the wire . in this ring geometry , where we use a magnetic flux to thread the ring for modulation",
    ", we find that when the inner radius of the ring is one order of magnitude smaller than the width of the attached wire , there exists one localized state trapped at the intersection with energy lying inside the lowest subband .",
    "the fano - type interference due to the coupling between this localized state and the continuum ones strongly modulates the transmission , leading to a fano line shape .",
    "however , the increase of the inner radius of the ring weakens this coupling and the asymmetric fano dip fades away . by tuning the magnetic flux for the structure with small inner radius of the ring , we find that a wide energy gap appears in the transmission when the fano antiresonance and the structure antiresonance are close to each other .",
    "we propose that our structure can be used as a transistor since large transmission amplitudes can be obtained in the same energy gap region when the two types of the antiresonance are tuned away from each other by changing the magnetic flux .",
    "we also demonstrate the strong robustness of this energy gap against the anderson disorder ( in contrast to an ordinary structure antiresonance ) .",
