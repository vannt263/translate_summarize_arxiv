    "charged particles create electron - hole pairs in a moderately p - doped epitaxial layer located on top of a highly p - doped ( p++ ) wafer substrate and below some highly doped p - well ( p++ ) implants of the front - end circuitry .",
    "the generated electrons are collected on a n - well implanted on top of the epitaxial layer . in conventional cps ,",
    "the epitaxial layer is not fully depleted , and the electrons move mainly by thermal diffusion .",
    "however , they are deflected by build - in voltages of the p - epi / p++ interfaces which somewhat guide them toward the n - well / p - epi collection diode .",
    "once collected , the charge is stored in the diode - parasitic capacitance , which voltage drop is amplified by a low - noise in - pixel amplifier .",
    "cps feature the possibility of fine pixel pitch ( down to @xmath2 ) providing a very good spatial resolution ( typically a few @xmath3 ) .",
    "the very thin epitaxial layer ( @xmath4 ) allows to thin the sensor down to @xmath5 , which turns into an exceptionally small material budget .",
    "furthermore , the sensors can be operated at room temperature , avoiding to use complicated cooling systems which additionally contribute to the material budget .",
    ".sensors design goals of star - pxl ( operational ) and new alice - its inner ( its - in ) and outer ( its - out ) layers .",
    "@xmath6 refers to the spatial resolution , and tid and niel to the ionizing and non - ionizing doses , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sensor s readout speed depends on the on - chip data processing circuitry .",
    "initially , the signal from the in - pixel amplifier was multiplexed to a common analog readout bus and sent out for further processing , giving a few @xmath7 readout time ( @xmath8 ) for a sensor of larger sensitive area . a factor of 1000 reduction in @xmath8 was obtained by reading in succession rows of the pixel matrix , allowing each pixel to send in parallel their signal to the column end , the so - called rolling shutter architecture .",
    "this data is then processed trough discriminators ending each column for digitization and then further processed by an on - chip data sparsification circuit .",
    "this allowed parallel column readout and reduced transmission band - width , shortening the @xmath8 to about @xmath9 .",
    "all these developments allowed the conception of a cps , called mimosa-28  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tabsensorsproperties ] ) , suited to the star - pxl detector  @xcite operated at rhic / bnl , the first vertex detector based on the cps technology .",
    "the star - pxl has successfully participated to two data - taking campaigns and is currently in operation .",
    "it has proven to be reliable and to deliver the expected added value for the star physics program .",
    "the 400 sensors composing the pxl have allowed accumulating a sizable amount of experience with these devices .",
    "the performances reached by the mimosa-28 sensor are not suited to match some of the more demanding requirements of the new alice - its  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tabsensorreq ] ) , mainly in terms of @xmath8 and power consumption ( outer layers ) , and to a lesser extent in terms of radiation tolerance   are the ones reported in the tdr , but more detailed studies have shown that significantly lower doses need to be tolerated . ] ( inner layers ) .",
    "this triggered the exploration of a new @xmath1 cmos process with several advantages to overcome the limitations of the ams @xmath0 cmos process used for mimosa-28 .",
    "this document describes the features of the new cmos process and its advantages as compared to elder ones .",
    "furthermore , current status of the r&d for the conception of a sensor adapted for the alice - its outer layers is also presented .",
    "to overcome the limitations of the mimosa-28 sensor for the alice - its application , it was decided to migrate to the novel tower - jazz @xmath1 cmos process .",
    "one of its aspects is the smaller feature size , improving the @xmath8 ( higher integration density ) and tolerance to ionizing radiation .",
    "furthermore , the process grants thicker epitaxial layers with higher resistivity , improving the signal - to - noise ratio and tolerance to non - ionizing radiation .",
    "finally , the new technology concedes for deep p - well implants which shield the n - well hosting pmos transistors , preventing parasitic charge collection .",
    "this allows both pmos and nmos transistors to be used inside pixels , permitting to implement an in - pixel discriminator .",
    "all these features widen the choice of the readout architecture strategy .",
    "an asynchronous readout similar to the one used for the hybrid pixel sensors  @xcite is pursued via the alpide design  @xcite , which is the most promising approach to equip the alice - its inner layers .",
    "this approach comes with certain risks of missing the project s tight schedule , as it requires building and testing a complex pixel matrix with several new features to be validated . in order to be on schedule it was decided to also follow a more conservative approach , the mistral - o chip , using the validated rolling shutter readout of the mimosa-28 sensor .",
    "mistral - o was intended to instrument the alice - its outer layers , which feature two orders of magnitude higher surface to cover , thus requiring special attention on power consumption , response uniformity and robustness .",
    "mistral - o needs to be about 10 times faster than mimosa-28 together with twice less power consumption ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tabsensorreq ] ) .",
    "it has as well to be pin - to - pin compatible with the alpide design , which includes pads over the pixel matrix suited to laser soldering .",
    "furthermore , the sensor s slow control and digital logic need to be adapted to alpide s standards .      as a first step for validating the new @xmath1 cmos - process ,",
    "a full scale prototype called fsbb - m0 was built early in 2015 ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tabsensorsproperties ] ) .",
    "the sensor includes a very similar analog front - end and digital readout chain as the mimosa-28 sensor with a @xmath8 reduced by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "this was achieved by reducing the number of pixels in a column to be readout ( @xmath11 ) and increasing the size of the pixel long the column ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "furthermore , the rolling shutter readout mode addresses simultaneously all pixels belonging to a pair of neighboring rows .",
    "therefore , each discriminator addresses 208 pixels instead of 928 , with a proportionnally reduced @xmath8 .",
    "the sensing nodes are staggered in order to maximize the uniformity of the sensing node density and to alleviate the spatial resolution asymmetry consecutive to the pixel s rectangular shape .",
    "moreover , the sparsification circuit allows to find clusters of pixels in 2-dimensional windows instead of the 1-dimensional ones of mimosa-28 , which had to be merged off - line .",
    "several fsbb - m0 sensors were first studied in the laboratory , where their temporal and fixed pattern noise performances were assessed over a wide range of positive temperatures .",
    "these measurements were performed before and after irradiation with an x - ray source ( up to @xmath13 ) and with @xmath14 neutrons ( up to @xmath15 ) , up to doses relevant for the alice - its inner layers ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tabsensorreq ] ) .",
    "the sensors were next tested with particle beams at the cern - sps with negatively charger pions of @xmath16 , and at desy with electrons of @xmath17 .",
    "each set - up was made of six fsbb - m0 sensors operated simultaneously on beam .",
    "the performances of each sensor were assessed by considering it as a device under test ( dut ) and the rest as reference planes for track reconstruction ( telescope ) .",
    "the measurements showed satisfactory results , ilustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig - fsbbbis_nonirradiated ] .",
    "a nearly @xmath18 detection efficiency and a dark occupancy of @xmath19 was observed for all non - irradiated sensors tested .",
    "the dark occupancy could be reduced by an order of magnitude by masking a small fraction ( @xmath20 ) of the noisiest pixels , with negligible impact on the detection efficiency .",
    "satisfactory detection efficiency ( @xmath21 ) was also obtained for sensors irradiated at doses relevant for the alice - its inner layers , and dark occupancies of @xmath19 were obtained by masking the @xmath22 noisiest pixels .",
    ".,width=264,height=151 ]    in order to estimate the telescope pointing resolution ( @xmath23 ) at the dut position , the experimental set - up was simulated with a geant4-based tool .",
    "a @xmath23 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) , was obtained at the cern - sps ( desy ) beam test facility .",
    "the low ( high ) values of @xmath23 correspond to the dut located at the center ( ends ) of the sensors layout .",
    "this allowed to estimate the dut spatial resolution ( @xmath6 ) by subtracting the @xmath23 from the track - hit residue .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fsbbbis_nonirradiated ] , a @xmath6 of @xmath28 was obtained for all six sensors tested , with a slightly higher value along the long - side of the rectangular pixel ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "it is substantially better than one would expect for the digital readout according to the @xmath30 rule .",
    "this follows from charge charing , giving a hit pixel multiplicity of about 3 in average , thereby providing a substantially better @xmath6 based on the center - of - gravity of the cluster of pixels .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath6 to charge sharing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fsbbbis_trkpositionwrtdiode_vs_mult ] , which displays , for different hit pixel multiplicities , the tracks impact position with respect to the closest collection diode .",
    "one can appreciate the regions with respect to the collection diodes where an impinging particle needs to hit the sensor in order to produce a given pixel multiplicity .",
    "the sizes of those regions give a measurement of the spatial resolution , which vary smoothly from one hit pixel multiplicity to the other .",
    "even if a subset of about @xmath31 of the hits show only one pixel , they exhibit a @xmath6 much better than @xmath32 in both pixel directions .",
    "such single pixel clusters are formed exclusively by particles impinging the pixel near the collection diode ( top - left plot of fig .",

    "the next step consisted in addressing the alice - its requirements by achieving nearly twice less readout time and power consumption .",
    "a large fraction of the power consumption is due to the in - pixel circuitry .",
    "power savings can then be achieved by minimizing the number of pixels per sensor , i.e. by increasing their dimensions .",
    "this approach exploited the alleviated spatial resolution requirement for the outer layers as compared to the inner layers ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tabsensorreq ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the use of large pixels elongated in the row direction further downscales the number of pixels per discriminator and the number of columns per surface unit , reducing in this way the @xmath8 and the power consumption .",
    "the increase of the pixel surface has however drawbacks in terms of charge collection .",
    "the mean distance the signal charges cross until being collected increases as the collection diode density is reduced , increasing the probability for charge trapping by defects of the silicon crystalline structure .",
    "this probability is further enhanced after non - ionizing irradiation . however ,",
    "this effect is foreseen to remain acceptable given the relaxed requirements in the alice - its outer layers .",

    "two different pixel dimensions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 were implemented .",
    "each pixel incorporates a sensing node connected to a pre - amplifier featuring a feedback loop ended with a forward biased diode compensating the leakage current delivered by the sensing node and fixing its depletion voltage .",
    "the preamplifier is followed by a clamping circuit subtracting the pixel pedestal and connected to a discriminator located at the column end .",
