    "mass flows are an active research topic in magnetic confinement fusion due to their importance for plasma stability and confinement . in recent years",
    ", both experimental and theoretical efforts were made to improve understanding of the momentum transport mechanisms that determine the observed plasma rotation profiles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that fluctuating zonal flows ( zf ) in magnetically confined plasmas can be driven by turbulence through an inverse cascade process familiar from 2d hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .",
    "these structures are thought to regulate turbulent transport by a ) draining energy from small scale turbulence , via the turbulent momentum flux ( reynolds and maxwell stresses ) , and depositing it into the @xmath2 mode ( with @xmath3 and thus @xmath4 ) , and b ) breaking up turbulent eddies once the associated sheared flow pattern is formed . in this view , large - scale flows ( mean and fluctuating ) and small - scale turbulence form a dynamical system whose equilibrium state determines the turbulent transport levels @xcite .",
    "possibly , zfs could explain one of the most fundamental , long - standing issues in fusion physics : the low - to - high confinement transition ( see @xcite for a recent experimental finding in this respect ) . indeed , the practical importance of zonal flows stems from their capability to affect global cross - field transport .",
    "experimentally , global , fluctuating flow patterns manifest themselves as electric potential structures exhibiting long - range correlation ( lrc ) , and have been observed in different devices using langmuir probes and heavy ion beam probes @xcite .",
    "these lrc potential structures oscillate but are constant on a flux surface ( which amounts to having @xmath5 ) , but to qualify as a zonal flow - like structure they must also be ` zonal ' ( i.e. have a finite radial scale @xmath6 ) and be dominated by low frequencies ( somewhere between the characteristic time - scales of turbulence , @xmath7s , and confinement , @xmath8ms ) . the turbulent drive of the zf has mainly been investigated @xcite using bi - spectral techniques @xcite , and a flow generation mechanism by three - wave coupling was identified , in accordance with rather general considerations concerning the structure of drift - wave equations @xcite .",
    "although some devices have reported a reduction of the broadband spectral power of turbulence associated with the presence of large scale flows ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , the crucial practical property of a zf ( i.e. , its ability to regulate global transport ) has not been tested experimentally in fully developed broadband turbulence .    in this paper , we provide empirical evidence of global transport regulation by zonal flow - like potential structures with long distance correlation . for that purpose",
    ", we present a simple method to isolate the temporal evolution of the fluctuating , collective floating potential oscillations from the combined measurements of a 2d langmuir probe array and a toroidally separated single probe pin .",
    "this allows us to characterize the time - resolved dynamics and to study its effect on edge potential profiles , local turbulence , and global particle transport .",
    "we find that the instantaneous zf amplitude modulates global particle fluxes dynamically , as reflected by @xmath1 radiation monitors around the device .",
    "we show that the ability to identify spontaneous and collective rotation events with flux surface symmetry opens up the possibility to study effective viscosity in stellarators and tokamaks , without the need of external momentum input through nbi @xcite or external biasing @xcite .",
    "experiments where carried out in the 4-period , flexible , low shear stellarator tj - ii using electron cyclotron heated plasmas .",
    "the typical magnetic field strength is @xmath9 t and the rotational transform @xmath10 at the last closed flux surface ( lcfs ) ( typical minor radius @xmath11 is 20 cm ) , dropping slowly to a central value of @xmath12 .",
    "electron temperatures range from @xmath13 kev at the centre to an edge value of @xmath14 ev .",
    "pin arrangement in the 2d probe and orientation with respect to the magnetic field structure of tj - ii . ]",
    "the floating potential measurements presented in this work were obtained with a 2d array of @xmath15 tungsten pins , with radial and poloidal separations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 mm , respectively ( see figure [ fig : probe ] ) .",
    "simultaneous measurements are taken with another pin in a different sector of the machine , having a long parallel connection length with the 2d probe ( @xmath18 m).the sampling rate of the floating potential signals is 2 mhz .",
    "the results presented here depend crucially on the separation of the zf contribution to the floating potential oscillations the long range correlated part of the potential fluctuations  from the uncorrelated , local fluctuations .",
    "this is achieved by means of a singular value decomposition ( svd ) , described below ( an alternative method based on the same idea but using the hilbert - huang transform has recently been proposed @xcite ; early applications of svd to fluctuations in plasmas can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "given a @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 , its svd consists of a product of three matrices @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are unitary matrices ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 is a real , non - negative , diagonal matrix with elements @xmath26 sorted in decreassing order , i.e. @xmath27 . the @xmath28 and @xmath29 column vectors , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are orthonormal vector sets and are called _ topos _ and _ chronos _ respectively @xcite . in terms of the topos and chronos vectors , equation ( [ eq : svd ] ) can be written as @xmath32 this nomenclature is most appropriate when the matrix @xmath20 consists of the signals of spatially separated measurements .",
    "this is also the case here , i.e. we construct the matrix @xmath20 as @xmath33 , where the @xmath34 are the 20 floating potentials measured with the 2d probe and @xmath35 is the floating potential of the distant probe .",
    "the @xmath36 index ranges over the number of samples in the floating potential signals ( @xmath37 in the dataset used below ) .",
    "the cross correlation matrix of the signals for time lag @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of the topos vectors : @xmath39 this can be seen from @xmath40 inserting the svd decomposition ( eq.([eq : svd ] ) ) one obtains @xmath41 which is the matrix form of equation ( [ eq : xcorr ] ) .",
    "the total signal energy has the simple expression @xmath42    with our naming convention of the floating potentials , the long range correlation between any one probe @xmath43 in the 2d array and the remote probe is given by @xmath44 .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xcorr ] ) , one can write the lrc as a sum of the contributions of each of the topos @xmath45 @xmath46 we have defined a new quantity , the _ partial eigenmode correlation _ @xmath47 . in view of the fact that this quantity gives the correlation of the distant probe with all the 20 signals in the 2d probe ,",
    "this vector has 20 entries .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : lrc ] ) simply expresses that for a particular topo @xmath45 to contribute significantly to the lrc , it must carry a significant fraction of the signal energy ( @xmath48 ) and involve the distant probe signal ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the surface plots shown in figure [ fig : svd ] show the partial eigenmode correlation of the first two svd modes of a 30 ms record of floating potential measurements .",
    "the average plasma density is stable at around @xmath50 m@xmath51 , and the innermost pins of the 2d probe display a long range correlation of 0.53 ( normalized to @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "the 20 first components of @xmath53 corresponding to the 2d probe array are rearranged in a square matrix , mimicking their actual spatial distribution .",
    "the surface colouring corresponds to the total lrc of the 2d pins that is given by the sum of the individual eigenmode partial correlations according to eq.([eq : lrc ] ) .",
    "this empirical decomposition reveals three characteristics features that are consistently reproduced for other similar shots having lrcs .    *",
    "the topo ( and the lrc ) displays a symmetry in the poloidal direction . while this is to be expected for sufficiently low @xmath0 modes it has to be stressed that this symmetry is not imposed by the svd technique but appears naturally .",
    "* the first mode @xmath54 accounts for most of the lrc observed in the 2d array ( compare the colorbar and the @xmath55-values of the topos , i.e. the partial eigenmode correlation , in fig.[fig : svd ] ) .",
    "* ther first mode accounts for a significant part of both the cumulative signal energy @xmath56 ( namely @xmath57 ) and the distant probe s fluctuation energy @xmath58 ( with @xmath59 ) . *",
    "the frequency spectrum of the first chrono is dominated by low frequencies @xmath60 khz .    from these observations , we conclude that the coherent floating potential evolution given by the first svd mode is a global , low - frequency - dominated , low-@xmath0 electric potential structure that we will refer to as the _ zonal flow _ ( zf ) component . in matrix form",
    "@xmath61 therefore , the first chrono will be tentatively identified with the evolution of zonal flow amplitude , symbolically @xmath62 .",
    "subtraction of the zf component from the total 2d floating potential evolution provides a local , largely uncorrelated turbulent component given by @xmath63 both zf and local components are extracted at the same time resolution as the original signals .",
    "also , one should keep in mind that the identification made in equation [ eq : zf ] is not absolute in any sense ( hence : zonal flow - like ) , but rather , motivated by the observations made above .",
    "the conditional averages and correlation analyses presented in the next section confirm this interpretation .",
    "figure [ fig : chronos ] shows the zf amplitude @xmath64 ( i.e. the first svd chronos ) alongside one of the 2d - array floating potentials and the distant probe signal .",
    "@xmath64 clearly reflects most of the temporal evolution of either potential .",

    "averaged radial profile of floating potentials measured with the 2d probe for different ranges of zf amplitude .",
    "the inset shows the probability density function of the zf amplitude .",
    "instantaneous profiles falling within each of the nine bars are averaged and correspond to the entries in the legend , where @xmath65 is the standard deviation of the zf amplitude .",
    "the top plot shows the corresponding @xmath66 ( curves , left axis ) and shearing rates ( circles , right axis ) . ]",
    "the modulation of the floating potential profiles @xmath67 by the zf and their derived electric fields @xmath68 and shearing rates @xmath69 are shown in figure [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "time slices are selected corresponding to specific ranges of @xmath70 values , and the floating potentials are time - averaged over those slices .",
    "the inset in figure [ fig : profiles ] shows the probability distribution of @xmath70 whose values are given in the normalised units used to represent the chronos vectors .",
    "the floating potential modulations show how this value translate into volts at the different locations .",
    "thus , we find that positive zonal flow amplitudes increase the @xmath71 shearing rate , reaching values over @xmath72 s@xmath73 at @xmath74 , whereas negative amplitudes act to flatten the mean potential profile , reducing the shearing rate .",
    "the overall mean profile coincides with the black curve , corresponding to the zero zf amplitude .",
    "the maximum zf amplitude is located around @xmath75 near the second innermost row .",
    "this is confirmed by measurements in which the probe was located further inside the plasma column . from the profile modification ,",
    "a rough estimate of the zf radial scale is @xmath76 cm @xmath77 ( ion larmor radius ) .",
    "the oscillating radial electric field computed from the floating potential gradient varies from @xmath78 to @xmath79 kv / m at the location of the peak @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath71 poloidal velocities obtained from this @xmath66 estimate range from @xmath80 to @xmath81 km / s .",
    "it should be noted that these estimates of @xmath66 and @xmath82 do not take into account the electron temperature contribution to the plasma potential .",
    "besides , all but the innermost pins in the 2d probe are shadowed by the insulating boron nitride probe body , which may introduce further ( although smaller ) corrections to the mean plasma potential caused by the density wake of the parallel ion flow past the probe @xcite . however their observed modulations or relative changes are less sensitive to these corrections and are considered a good proxy of plasma potential modifications .",

    "bottom : dynamical parameter of a zf burst extracted from the conditionally averaged @xmath70 pulse shape and the model given by equation [ eq : model ] .",
    "@xmath70 units are arbitrary .",
    "the peak amplitude ( @xmath84 ) correspond to about @xmath85v increase in the inner floating potentials . ]",
    "these oscillations are collective for they are observed in both probes .",
    "this is illustrated by the floating potential evolution shown in figure [ fig : condazf ] , conditionally averaged over 152 events with @xmath86 .",
    "the response of the distant probe has the same waveform as that observed with the 2d array .",
    "the average waveform of the zonal flow burst can be used to estimate characteristic parameters of the zf dynamics .",
    "we model its time evolution with the simple 1d differential equation @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the zf drive ( which may depend on @xmath70 ) and @xmath89 is the damping rate due to constant viscous forces .",
    "an estimate of @xmath89 is obtained from an exponential fit to the tail of the zf decay in the @xmath90 \\mu$]s interval ( figure [ fig : condazf ] ) , assuming the flow is freely decaying ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the resulting decay time is @xmath92s , similar to the decay time measured in earlier work @xcite using external biasing switch - off experiments .",
    "note that this damping rate is a measure of effective viscosity corresponding to the flux surface . using this value",
    ", we also obtain the time evolution of the forcing term @xmath88 by integration of eq.([eq : model ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : condazf ] shows that the waveform of @xmath93 if almost square . rise and decay times are both @xmath94s for a total boost duration of @xmath95s . in physical units , the incremental force ( acceleration ) and asymptotic velocity are respectively @xmath96 m / s@xmath97 , and @xmath98 km / s .",
    "equation ( [ eq : model ] ) can be interpreted to model the evolution of the flux surface averaged poloidal velocity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath93 is the turbulent drive ( associated with the reynolds stress ) and the @xmath99 term accounts for the neoclassical viscosity or magnetic pumping effect . to obtain the dynamical model parameters we had to rely on the hypothesis that the forcing term is small in the region of the fit , as suggested by the exponential waveform typical of freely decaying flows ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and assume that the viscous coefficient is constant in time .",
    "future work will investigate both the relation between the zf drive and the locally measured reynolds stress , and the relation between the observed damping time and the effective neoclassical flow decay rate .",
    "expected values of power in the high @xmath0 part of the spectrum as a function of the zf amplitude .",
    "the absolute spectral power in these wavelengths increases for decreasing radius . to simplify comparison",
    ", we have normalized the spectral power at each radius to the corresponding time average power , and expressed the result as percent difference w.r.t . this value . ]",
    "the 4 poloidally separated pins of the 2d probe allow us to obtain the instantaneous spectral power in the @xmath100 and @xmath81 cm@xmath73 wave - vectors . in figure",
    "[ fig : highk ] , we plot the expected value of the spectral power of the uncorrelated part of the floating potential in the two non - zero @xmath0 wave numbers , @xmath102 , as a function of the zf amplitude for several radial locations .",
    "( that is , @xmath103 where the spatial fourier transform is applied to the corresponding entries of the local floating potential @xmath104 only , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zf ] ) and ( [ eq : local ] ) ) .",
    "it is found that positive zf amplitudes are correlated with a @xmath105 reduction in the small scale fluctuations , while a comparable increase is observed for negative zf amplitudes .",
    "this is consistent with the profile modifications expected in either situation ( fig.[fig : profiles ] ) , as positive zf amplitudes increase the shearing rates , while negative zf amplitudes decrease them .",
    "cross correlation curves between the zonal flow amplitude and different @xmath1 monitors around the tj - ii stellarator ( inset , blue line ) .",
    "tj - ii has four equivalent quadrants , labelled a to d , and each quadrant is subdivided into 8 sectors .",
    "the @xmath1 signals are labelled according to their quadrant and sector .",
    "the cross correlation between the uncorrelated part of a floating potential ( refer to equation [ eq : local ] ) and the @xmath1 signals is low ( inset , grey line ) . ]",
    "the effect of these collective radial electric field modulations in the global particle transport becomes apparent in figure [ fig : halphas ] where the zf amplitude is plotted together with different monitors of @xmath1 radiation distributed around the device .",
    "@xmath1 is mainly emitted by neutrals recycled from the walls when outward particle fluxes reach the limiters and other material vessel components .",
    "clearly , specific zf relaxation events are followed by a burst of @xmath1 radiation in all monitors . this prominent visual impression is confirmed by the cross correlation of the zonal flow amplitude and an @xmath1 trace shown in the inset . the observed 100 @xmath89s time lag in the correlation curve implies an effective radial velocity of @xmath106 m / s , assuming that the plasma - wall distance is @xmath1071 cm .",
    "this velocity matches the typical radial velocity obtained from the turbulent @xmath108 convective transport . on the same axis",
    ", we also plot the cross correlation of an @xmath1 signal with the uncorrelated part of the floating potential measured at one of the innermost pins , showing a low positive correlation level .",
    "overall , these results suggest that the extraction method presented above is successful in identifying zfs that modify radial transport .",
    "the results shown here focus on the detailed analysis of one shot , however similar behaviour ( collective profile modulations anticorrelated with @xmath1 radiation ) is observed for other shots with a similar density ( around @xmath109 m@xmath51 ) displaying long range correlations . in previous work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that lrcs in tj - ii emerge in the vicinity of this value ( where the mean electric field changes from a positive to a negative root ) and at high densities ( @xmath110 m@xmath51 ) close to the l - h transition .",
    "the investigation of the spatio - temporal characteristics of the correlated structures at high density is left to future work .",
