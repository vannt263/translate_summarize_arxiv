    "concluded that sbs  1543 + 593 is low surface brightness ( lsb ) dwarf spiral galaxy .",
    "the idea that dwarf and lsb galaxies are responsible for at least some dlas was originally proposed by york et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and subsequently re - examined by several authors ( e.g. jimenez , bowen , & matteucci 1999 ; boissier , p ' eroux , & pettini 2002 ) .",
    "observationally , this has now been confirmed in a number of cases , at least at redshifts @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) have successfully identified many low - redshift dla systems , and are in the process of studying them with direct imaging ( e.g. , turnshek et al .",
    "2001 ; nestor et al . 2002 ; rao et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) . indeed , many turn out to be dwarf and/or lsb galaxies .",
    "the combination of low absorber redshift , small impact parameter , and brightness of the background qso ( @xmath24 , reimers & hagen 1998 ) makes sbs  1543 + 539 a highly promising system for investigating the all - important dla - galaxy connection in greater detail than is possible in more distant examples.km  s@xmath2)ton  1480 ( @xmath25 ) pair ( miller , knezek , & bregman 1999 ) , but the qso in this case is @xmath26mag fainter than hs  1543 + 5921 in the @xmath27-band .",
    "furthermore , the qso - galaxy impact parameter is @xmath28kpc , nearly 20 times greater than that of sbs  1543 + 539hs  1543 + 5921 . of course , any galaxy which presents a cross - section in  absorption greater than @xmath14()@xmath29  cm@xmath4 ( the historical limit defining dlas ) is capable of being a dla galaxy",
    "however , a background source is required to produce a continuum against which this   column can be measured . ]    more generally , sbs  1543 + 539 offers one of the best opportunities to compare element abundances measured from emission lines in  regions with those from cool interstellar gas producing absorption lines .",
    "this is a very important consistency check , as we now explain .",
    "essentially all available information on chemical abundances at high redshifts is from qso absorption line studies  data from other techniques are still very few and of limited accuracy ( pettini 2003 ) .",
    "conversely , most of what we know about the chemical composition of galaxies in the nearby universe is based on measurements of nebular lines from star - forming regions ( e.g. garnett 2003 ) . while in the milky way and",
    "the magellanic clouds these two different lines of enquiry give consistent results , there has so far been very little opportunity to compare them in other environments , at either high or low redshift .",
    "relevant to this point is the suggestion by kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) that the  regions of metal - poor galaxies may be self - polluted with metals produced in the immediate past and not yet mixed in the general interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "one such example _ may _ be the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy i  zw  18 , but opinions are still divided as to whether the o / h ratio measured from interstellar absorption lines is lower than the value found in the  regions ( kunth et al .",

    "the sbs  1543 + 539hs  1543 + 5921 pairing gives us the means to address these issues with a modest amount of observational effort and with fewer complications than i  zw  18 , where the interstellar absorption lines are viewed against the ( spatially extended ) background of a stellar cluster which is located _ within _ the galaxy , rather than a point source behind it .",
    "in anticipation of forthcoming ultraviolet spectroscopy of hs  1543 + 5921 with sufficient resolution for abundance determinations , we present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of sbs  1543 + 539 aimed at obtaining additional information about its properties not already covered in the studies by bowen et al .",
    "( 2001a , b ) . in particular , we report the first measurements of o and n abundances in one of the  regions of the galaxy .",

    "2 we describe the observations which consist of _ hst _ wfpc2 imaging and ground - based optical spectroscopy . in ",
    "3 we present our main results : the galaxy s region luminosity function (  3.1 ) , its star formation rate (  3.2 ) and element abundances (  3.3 ) .",
    "these are compared with similar results for nearby dwarf galaxies and high redshift dlas in  4 . in ",
    "5 we draw attention to specific problems which can be addressed by comparing the data presented here for sbs  1543 + 539 with those which will be obtained from absorption line studies of its neutral interstellar medium . finally , we summarize our main conclusions in  6 .",
    "we imaged the field of sbs  1543 + 593 with the wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) on _ hst _ on 20 september 2000 as part of our go program 8570 .",
    "the galaxy was located on the wf3 chip .",
    "exposures were obtained through the following filters : f225w ( 4000s ) , f336w ( 3000s ) , f450w ( 1000s ) , and f702w ( 1000s ) .",
    "figure  1 is a greyscale reproduction of an image formed by combining data from all four filters with the following color coding : red = f702w , green = f450w , and blue = f336w+f255w . as well as",
    "the qso hs  1543 + 5921 , a foreground star ( to the north - west of the qso ) , and several background galaxies , the image shows the faint spiral arms of sbs  1543 + 593 traced by a number of spatially extended objects which are likely to be regions .",
    "we used the f450w and f702w images to identify and measure the properties of these regions .",
    "the f450w and f702w observations each consisted of two 500s exposures , spatially offset from each other by a small amount . to obtain the final image for each filter ,",
    "the two exposures were registered and then combined ; pixels affected by cosmic - ray events were removed in the process .",
    "we decided to transform the _",
    "magnitudes derived from the f450w and f702w images to johnson - cousins @xmath32 magnitudes and @xmath33 color ( dolphin 2000 ) , so that our results could be compared more easily with others in the literature .",
    "the regions were identified using the deeper f702w image .",
    "this was accomplished by first subtracting the backgound signal , selecting a threshold magnitude of @xmath34mag  arcsec@xmath4 for the analysis , and smoothing the image using 3x3  pixel averaging .",
    "the midas aip software package was then used to generate a catalog of spatially extended objects .",
    "regions smaller than 4  pixels ( with areas @xmath35arcsec@xmath4 ) were subsequently rejected from the catalog .",
    "we then inspected the original image by eye to verify that the identified regions had the location and appearance of regions in sbs  1543 + 593 .",
    "figure  2 shows the final f702w image and an aip - derived outer isophote for the galaxy corresponding to an _ hst _ magnitude @xmath36mag  arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "identified regions are labeled in figure  2 and listed in table  1 in order of increasing `` y '' pixel position .",
    "our final catalog comprises 33 likely regions .",
    "note that the bright region observed spectroscopically by reimers & hagen ( 1998 ) corresponds to our region # 5 , but these authors may have also included flux from region # 7 in their spectrum .",
    "the mask derived from the f702w image was then applied to the f450w image for the corresponding analysis .    for each of the regions , table  1 gives an identifying number , wf3 x - y pixel coordinates , ra and dec coordinates derived from the iraf / stsdas package metric , the @xmath32 magnitude and @xmath33 color , errors , and parameters describing the sizes and shapes of the regions ( area , semi - major axis , minor - to - major axis ratio , and position angle ) .",
    "table  1 should be considered a list of _ candidate _",
    "regions , because we can not definitively discern the objects true nature ( i.e. , whether they are background galaxies , star clusters , or regions ) based on magnitude and color information alone . on the other hand ,",
    "most of them are likely to be  regions ; certainly this is the case for all the objects covered by our spectroscopic observations described below .",
    "we also determined the total @xmath32 magnitude of the galaxy ( within the 26.8 mag arcsec@xmath4 isophote shown on figure  2 ) after subtracting the qso and the star .",
    "we found r@xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the errors quoted here are total errors and include the photometric and background errors , the errors from the subtraction of the quasar and foreground star , errors for transformation to johnson - cousins @xmath27 and @xmath32 , and zero point errors .",
    "the total magnitude error is dominated by the errors in the subtraction of the qso and the star . of course the magnitudes quoted also",
    "depend on the surface brightness level to which they are measured .",
    "thus , our total @xmath32-band magnitude is significantly brighter than that determined by reimers & hagen ( 1998 ) , who measured @xmath39 to the 24mag  arcsec@xmath4 isophote , but is in good agreement with the value of @xmath19 derived by bowen et al .",
    "( 2001a ) from their fit to the surface - brightness profile .    from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 )",
    "we find that the galactic foreground extinctions are relatively small , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the qso and some regions in sbs  1543 + 593 were obtained in service mode with the double - beam cassegrain spectrograph ( isis ) of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma , canary islands , and with the blue channel spectrograph of the 6.5 m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) . in all cases",
    "we used a 2@xmath42  wide slit ; other details of the observations are collected in table  2 .    figure  2 shows the location of the slit overlaid on the contour map of the galaxy .",
    "we attempted to maintain this same slit location for all spectroscopic observations and were aided in this by the presence of the qso .",
    "however , we have no way of estimating uncertainties in the emission line fluxes which may result from small differences in slit positioning and from seeing fluctuations .",
    "the slit was oriented at position angle pa=10.5degrees east of north , so as to include the qso and the brightest region in sbs  1543 + 593 ( region # 5 ) .",
    "this precluded us from observing at the parallactic angle .",
    "as can be seen from figure 2 , with this orientation we also covered four other  regions , in two close pairs ( # 12 , # 15 , and # 27 , # 28 respectively ) ; however , each member of the pair is not resolved .    in figure  3",
    "we have reproduced a portion of the two - dimensional isis red spectrum covering the h@xmath0 , [ n  ii ]  @xmath43 , and [ s  ii ]  @xmath44 emission lines .",
    "regions and the qso are marked on the @xmath45-axis .",
    "interestingly , in addition to the  regions targeted , we also detect emission lines from a previously unrecognized source , labeled `` x '' in figure  3 , 2.9@xmath42  to the north of region # 5 .",
    "there is no evidence of this region in the _ hst _ f702w image ( see figure  1 ) , nor in the unfiltered stis image obtained by bowen et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard techniques in iraf ; this included bias substraction , flat fielding , sky subtraction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "the acquisition of the isis red spectrum was accompanied by observations of two standard stars , g138 - 31 and kopff  27 .",
    "both stars were observed through a 6@xmath42 wide slit , under the same seeing conditions as the object , 1@xmath42 fwhm , and at low airmass ( 1.06 ) .",
    "we chose g138 - 31 for the flux calibration .",
    "however , in order to investigate systematic errors due to the flux calibration , we compared the fluxes derived , both for the qso and region # 5 , using the other standard star available , kopff  27 .",
    "we found that the qso flux is 15% lower at the blue end when calibrated with kopff  27 , and that this offset reduces to 4% at the red end of the spectrum .",
    "thus , we estimate the systematic flux error at h@xmath0 for  region # 5 to be @xmath465% .",
    "one dimensional extractions of the  region spectra are reproduced in figure  4 .",
    "figure 5 shows the isis spectrum of  region # 5 obtained with the blue arm of isis .",
    "it includes the h@xmath47 line and the [ ]  @xmath48 doublet (  region # 5 is the only one in which these lines are detected in our blue spectra ) .",
    "data obtained over two nights were combined to derive the final calibrated spectrum .",
    "the individual spectra were calibrated relative to the standard star bd  + 17  4708 , which was observed on both nights under similar seeing conditions , through a 2@xmath42 wide slit , and at low airmass ( 1.0 ) .",
    "note , however , that the observations of sbs  1543 + 593 were obtained at higher airmasses , 1.5 and 2.0 on the two nights respectively ( see table 2 ) . under these conditions",
    "we expect significant atmospheric dispersion , but the effect is likely to be negligible over the small wavelength interval between the emission lines of interest , i.e. , h@xmath47 and [ ]  @xmath49 .",
    "the temperature sensitive [ ]  @xmath50 line remains undetected in  region # 5 , despite the long exposure time of 10000s ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "any systematic offset in the flux calibrations of the blue and red spectra will affect the measured ratio of h@xmath0 to h@xmath47 , needed to estimate the internal reddening of  region # 5 , and the determination of the nitrogen - to - oxygen ratio .",
    "unfortunately , there is no wavelength overlap between the isis red spectrum obtained on april 25 , 2000 and the isis blue spectra recorded on june 12 & 13 , 2001 .",
    "we tried to interpolate across this wavelength gap using the spectral energy distribution of the qso , but its rich iron spectrum makes judging the location of the continuum difficult .",
    "thus , we are unable to provide a quantitative assessment of systematic flux errors ; our best guess is that the offset between the red and the blue spectra is no larger than 15% .",
    "the isis blue spectra do not extend to sufficiently short wavelengths to include the [ ]  @xmath51 emission line .",
    "for this reason , we obtained an additional short exposure with the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph ; the one - dimensional spectrum is shown in figure  6 .",
    "the conditions were not photometric and we did not obtain a standard - star observation during this night .",
    "however , there is substantial overlap in the spectral coverage of the mmt and the wht spectra .",
    "we calibrated the mmt spectrum with reference to the wht one , by forcing the fluxes of the emission lines in common ( h@xmath47 and [ ] ) to agree between the two sets of observations ( the observed mean ratio for the three emission lines in common was @xmath52 ) .",
    "the rest frame fluxes of all the emission lines detected are collected in table  3 .",
    "the flux errors quoted are random errors only .",
    "they reflect the @xmath53 error in the continuum underlying the line ; a @xmath54 upper limit is given for lines that were not detected .",
    "in addition , the spectroscopy enabled us to make an independent determination of the redshift of sbs  1543 + 593 .",
    "the observed wavelengths of the emission lines are listed in table  3 .",
    "we derive a mean redshift of @xmath55 for sbs  1543 + 593 , which is the same as the value measured by bowen et al .",
    "( 2001b ) from 21 cm emission .",
    "the regions are tracers of the young stellar population in sbs  1543 + 539 .",
    "they are scattered throughout the disk of sbs  1543 + 539 .",
    "the stars in the disk are not resolved .",
    "the yellow - reddish color of the unresolved disk light indicates that an older and more contiguous stellar population underlies the sprinkling of regions ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the light of the unresolved stars , together with the distribution of regions , trace a spiral arm - like pattern .",
    "we therefore classify this galaxy as a type sm . according to the definitions by de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) and sandage & bingelli ( 1984 ) , sm galaxies are the latest - type dwarfs in which some fragmentary traces of a spiral pattern are still present , while dwarfs of even later type are classified as i m .",
    "the latter are galaxies that have a totally chaotic appearance , but the differences are really quite subtle .",
    "( panel 21 in sandage & bingelli 1984 also serves to illustrate the appearance of high surface brightness bcds , such as i  zw  18 ; a comparison with panels 1217 shows clearly how different bcds are from sm / im galaxies ) .    with the _ caveat _ that not all of the candidates listed in table  1 may turn out to be  regions , it is instructive to consider their global properties , for comparison with those of other nearby galaxies (  4.2 ) .",
    "a color - magnitude plot of the candidate  regions listed in table  1 indicates that there are four objects with colors or magnitudes which lie outside the main distribution .",
    "it is possible that these extended objects were erroneously considered to be candidate  regions in sbs  1543 + 539 . in what follows",
    ", we assume a value of @xmath56 for the total number of  regions in sbs  1543 + 539 .",
    "following equation ( 1 ) of kennicutt , edgar & hodge ( 1989 ) , the @xmath32-band luminosity function ( lf ) of the candidate  regions was fitted by a power - law with slope @xmath57 .",
    "the luminosity function is complete down to @xmath58 .",
    "if we interpret the @xmath32-magnitude as an h@xmath0 flux ( by simply scaling the @xmath32-magnitude by a factor of @xmath59 ) , then the slope becomes @xmath60 .",
    "the brightest region , # 5 , has an h@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath61ergs  s@xmath2 (  3.2 ) .",
    "this is the luminosity of quite an ordinary region ; it is , for example , a factor of @xmath62 lower than the h@xmath0 luminosity of a giant  region like 30  doradus in the lmc .",
    "region # 5 , is also the most extended one in sbs  1543 + 539 ( see table  1 ) , with a diameter of 1.9arcsec which translates to a linear size of about 390pc ( see  4.1 ) . the faintest  regions for which we believe to be complete have luminosities of about @xmath63ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "we can use the h@xmath0 emission line fluxes from the regions observed spectroscopically to estimate star formation rates , as follows .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of sbs  1543 + 539 , measured from 21 cm ( bowen et al .",
    "2001b ) and optical emission lines (  2.2 ) is @xmath21 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "correcting for the motion of the sun relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , and for the rotation of the lsr about the centre of the galaxy , we obtain a galactocentric velocity @xmath64 km  s@xmath2 . ignoring peculiar velocities giving rise to departures from the hubble flow",
    ", this corresponds to a distance @xmath65mpc . at this distance ,",
    "the h@xmath0 emission line fluxes listed in table  3 correspond to the following h@xmath0 luminosities : @xmath61ergs  s@xmath2 ( region # 5 ) ; @xmath66ergs  s@xmath2 ( object x ) ; @xmath67ergs  s@xmath2 ( regions # 12,15 ) ; and @xmath68ergs  s@xmath2 ( regions # 27,28 ) .",
    "with kennicutt s ( 1998 ) h@xmath0sfr calibration    @xmath69    we obtain sfr=(9.1 , 1.4 , 1.2 , 1.9)@xmath70  yr@xmath2 for the four regions respectively .",
    "the total @xmath32-band luminosity of all 33 regions is a factor of @xmath71 times that of regions # 5,12,15,27,28 .",
    "thus , we can obtain an approximate estimate of the total sfr in sbs  1543 + 539 by assuming that the @xmath32-band to h@xmath0 luminosity ratios are roughly the same for all 33 candidate regions .",
    "this assumption could be questioned because , for example , object x is not detected in @xmath32 , but it may be approximately valid when all the  regions are considered together . with this scaling , we estimate that the total h@xmath0 luminosity of sbs  1543 + 539 is @xmath72ergs  s@xmath2 which corresponds to a total sfr@xmath1  yr@xmath2 .      in this section",
    "we use the emission line fluxes listed in table  3 to deduce the nebular abundances of oxygen and nitrogen in  region # 5 .",
    "normally , the first step is to correct the line fluxes for effects of dust reddening .",
    "however , in our case the ratio @xmath73(h@xmath0)/@xmath73(h@xmath47)@xmath74 is _ smaller _ ( although consistent within the error ) than the case b recombination value of 2.86 for the ` standard ' @xmath75@xmath76 and @xmath77k  region density and temperature ( osterbrock 1989 ) . evidently , the reddening of  region # 5 is small and we therefore neglect it in the calculation of nebular abundances .",
    "[ the foreground galactic reddening of e(@xmath78)=0.016 determined from the maps by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) is also inconsequential ] .",
    "approximate estimates of the oxygen abundance in  regions have traditionally been obtained from the strong line index @xmath79 which relates ( o / h ) to the relative intensities of [ o  ii ]  @xmath51 , [ o  iii ]  @xmath48 , and h@xmath47 ( pagel et al . 1979 ) .",
    "recent reassessments by skillman , c^ ot ' e , & miller ( 2003 ) and kennicutt , bresolin , & garnett ( 2003 ) have shown that the resulting values of ( o / h ) are typically accurate to within @xmath80dex .",
    "in deriving the oxygen abundance we have made use of the most recent formulation by kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno ( 1999 ) of the analytical expressions by mcgaugh ( 1991 ) ; these formulae express ( o / h ) in terms of @xmath81 and the ionization index @xmath82 .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure 7 which shows the well - known double - valued nature of the relation .",
    "however , in this case the high value of @xmath81 ( @xmath83 ) corresponds to the region of the diagram where the upper and lower branches of the @xmath81 relation meet .",
    "taking into account the random errors in both the @xmath81 and @xmath84 indices ( calculated by propagating the errors listed in table  3 ) , we obtain values of @xmath85 which range from 7.96 to 8.61 , or @xmath86 .",
    "these in turn correspond to oxygen abundances of between 1/6 and 3/4 of solar ( [ o / h]@xmath87 to @xmath88 ) adopting the value @xmath89 from the recent reappraisal of solar photospheric abundances by holweger ( 2001 ) .",
    "more recently , kewley & dopita ( 2002 ) have used a combination of stellar population synthesis and photoionization models to develop a set of ionization parameter and abundance diagnostics which are also based on the use of the strong optical emission lines .",
    "they claim that because their techniques solve explicitly for both the ionization parameter and the chemical abundance , their diagnostics are an improvement over earlier methods , such as @xmath81 . applying their algorithms to our measurements in table  3 , we obtain @xmath90 , @xmath91dex lower than our previous estimate .",
    "we can also use the scaling relation between the @xmath92 parameter ( @xmath93}~\\lambda 6583/$]h@xmath0 ) and the oxygen abundance recently proposed by denicol , terlevich & terlevich ( 2002 ) to obtain an independent estimate of ( o / h ) from the relative strengths of [ n  ii ]  @xmath43 and h@xmath0 .",
    "their equation    @xmath94    yields @xmath95 .",
    "the quoted error here includes both the random error in our measurement of the @xmath92 index and the errors quoted in eq .",
    "the latter are from a least - squares fit to data of denicol et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which extend over an oxygen abundance range from 1/50 of solar to twice solar , and thus are an indication of the scatter of the data from the best - fit calibration .",
    "we place high confidence in our determination of the oxygen abundance with the @xmath92 index , because the [ n  ii ]  @xmath43 and h@xmath0 lines were measured from the same spectrum . moreover , this spectrum was recorded at low airmass ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "however , we note that the oxygen abundance derived using the @xmath92 index is in good agreement with the values obtained above using the ratios of [ o  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , and h@xmath47 , even though these emission lines were measured from different spectra obtained under less - than - optimal conditions .    thus",

    "nitrogen has both a primary and a secondary component , depending on whether the seed carbon and oxygen from which n is synthesized are those manufactured by the star during helium burning , or were already present when the star first condensed out of the interstellar medium . in  regions of nearby galaxies ,",

    "the ( n / o ) ratio in dlas exhibits a range of values which extends from the primary plateau at @xmath163 down to one order of magnitude less .",
    "the scatter is now well established and can not be attributed entirely to measurement errors .",
    "qualitatively , this difference between dlas at high redshifts on the one hand , and the most metal - poor  regions in the local universe on the other , is consistent with the idea of a delayed production of primary n from intermediate mass stars ( relative to the near - instantaneous release of o by type ii supernovae ) , as pointed out by pettini , lipman , & hunstead ( 1995 ) .",
    "quantitatively , however , the situation is more complicated .",
    "the large number of dlas with values of ( n / o ) below the primary plateau has led to speculation that the time delay between the realease of n and o may be longer than anticipated  which in turn would suggest that stars with masses @xmath165 can also contribute to the nucleosynthesis of n , perhaps aided by stellar rotation ( meynet & pettini 2003 ) .",
    "an alternative proposal has appealed to a truncated initial mass function ( prochaska et al .",
    "molaro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have drawn attention to the possibility that there may be a _",
    "lower _ limit to ( n / o ) which could be used to infer the level of primary production of n by massive stars .    a dissenting opinion to this general picture",
    "was put forward by izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) who were struck by the narrow range of values of ( n / o ) they measured in the most metal - poor bcds and proposed that the @xmath166 plateau constitutes a _ lower _ limit set by the primary production of n by the same massive stars which release o when they explode as supernovae .",
    "a corollary of this hypothesis is that the lower abundances of n measured in many dlas are spurious ; izotov , schaerer , & charbonnel ( 2001 ) attribute them to an overionization of  relative to   ( and  in cases where s is used instead of o ) .",
    "herein lies the importance of measuring @xmath14 ( ) in the dla in hs  1543 + 5921 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  10 , the ( n / o ) ratio we deduce for  region # 5 in sbs  1543 + 593 is typical of other  regions with an oxygen abundance of @xmath167 solar .",
    "it falls in the region of the diagram where secondary production begins to make a discernable contribution to the overall n yield and where time delay effects would have little impact on the measured ( n / o ) ratio .",
    "thus , if the ratio ( n / o ) in the cool , neutral gas of sbs  1543 + 593 turned out to be lower than the value measured in  region # 5 ( while the oxygen abundance was the same ) , overionization of  relative to  would be the most likely explanation .",
    "such an outcome would provide support for the interpretation of dla abundances proposed by izotov and collaborators .",
    "a similar test has recently been performed in i  zw  18 , but with conflicting conclusions . while aloisi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) deduced a value of @xmath14()/@xmath14 ( ) which is consistent with ( actually higher by a factor of @xmath168 than ) the ( n / o ) ratio in the  gas , the estimate by lecavalier des etangs et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is one order of magnitude lower than that of aloisi et al .",
    "remarkably , these two studies used the same _ fuse _ data !",
    "the problem in this case is partly due to the difficulty of deriving a reliable column density for . in any case , i  zw  18 is not ideal for this test , because the interstellar absorption lines are detected against the background of ob stars _ within _ the galaxy , so that the line of sight _ must _ include ionized , as well as neutral , gas .",
    "furthermore , there may be concerns with interpreting absorption due to the superposition of multiple sight - lines .",
    "the experiment is much cleaner in the case of the sbs  1543 + 593/hs  1543 + 5921 pair , since the qso is at much higher redshift than the galaxy and is a point source .",
    "thus we await with anticipation the results of high resolution ultraviolet observations of this qso - galaxy pair .",
    "the main conclusion from the imaging and spectroscopic observations of sbs  1543 + 593 presented here is that this is an sm dwarf galaxy of intermediate surface brightness , with properties which are entirely in line with those of other local dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have obtained the first determinations of the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in a _ bona fide _ dla galaxy using emission line diagnostics which refer to the ionized gas , rather than the neutral interstellar medium more commonly probed with qso absorption line spectroscopy .",
    "we deduce @xmath169 solar and @xmath170 solar ; these values are consistent with other properties of sbs  1543 + 593 , including its morphology which shows it to be an evolved disk galaxy with a mix of young and old stars .",
    "the value of these measurements is that they provide a reference for future uv spectroscopy of the dla .",
    "the  region to which they refer is the brightest in sbs  1543 + 593 and is located only 3.3kpc from the qso sightline  over this distance we do not expect significant abundance gradients .",
    "available , low resolution , spectra of the qso hs  1543 + 5921 only allows us to establish a lower limit to the oxygen abundance which is not particularly informative , @xmath171 solar , because the  @xmath172 line is saturated . in reality",
    "the abundance of o in the neutral ism must be much larger , since this lower limit corresponds to a velocity dispersion of the gas of several hundred km  s@xmath2 which is excluded by the available 21 cm emission line profile . we make a prediction for the column density of , whose uv absorption lines are expected to be only mildly saturated and should therefore provide a more precise measure of the abundance of the @xmath0-capture elements than .",
    "we have also highlighted the importance of  as a test of the ionization corrections which may apply to dla abundance determinations .",
    "the location of  region # 5 in a plot of ( n / o ) vs. ( o / h ) , near the intersection of the primary and secondary levels of nitrogen production , will make it easier to distinguish between ionization and time - delay effects as the cause of the low n abundances reported in several high redshift dlas .",
    "all in all , the sbs  1543 + 539hs  1543 + 5921 pair is particularly well - suited for a long - overdue comparison between absorption and emission line abundance measurements in dlas , because hs  1543 + 5921 : ( 1 ) shines near centrally through the disk of sbs  1543 + 539 and ( 2 ) is a bright background point source , rather than an extended cluster of stars within the galaxy . in this paper",
