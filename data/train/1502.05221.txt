    "the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy was the last classical dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) discovered before the advent of the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "its discovery was made by @xcite and it was identified while performing a spectroscopic radial velocity survey of the galactic bulge stars @xcite .",
    "its heliocentric distance ( @xmath1 kpc , from @xcite ) makes it the second closest known satellite galaxy of the milky way ( mw ) and , because of the strong tidal interaction suffered by the sgr dsph during its orbit , it has left behind a well - known stellar stream @xcite , whose chemical characteristics have been recently studied and compared with the ones of the sgr main body and other dsph galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the sgr dwarf galaxy has been classified as a dsph because of its very low central surface brightness ( @xmath2 mag arcsec@xmath3 , from @xcite ) , its very small total amount of gas ( @xmath4 , from @xcite ) and because of the age and metallicity of its main stellar population , which dates back to the age of the universe and it is on average very iron poor . chemical abundances in sgr have been measured by many authors up to now ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of these studies have shown that the abundance patterns in sgr are different than those in the mw .",
    "this work aims at testing the suggestions of @xcite , which claimed that the @xmath0-element deficiencies observed in the sgr dsph galaxy can not be explained only by means of the time - delay model @xcite but they rather result from an initial mass function ( imf ) deficient in the highest mass stars . on the other hand",

    "@xcite also suggested that the eu abundances in the sgr galaxy might be explained by core - collapse sne , whose progenitors are stars less massive than the main oxygen producers , as previously envisaged also by @xcite . since many studies of nucleosynthesis have pointed out the difficulty of producing r - process elements during sn explosions @xcite , in this work , we test different scenarios for the eu production , both the one in which eu is produced by core - collapse sne and the most recent one , where the eu is synthesized in neutron star mergers ( nsms , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter scenario was recently explored in the context of a detailed chemical evolution model by @xcite , where they were able to well match the [ eu / fe ] abundance ratios observed in the mw stars .    here",

    "the main effect of the metallicity - dependent igimf of r14 is a dependence of the maximum possible stellar mass , that can be formed within a stellar cluster , on the [ fe / h ] abundance and on the sfr , especially if the latter is very low .",

    "the igimf is based on the following assumptions , based on observations .    1 .",
    "the mass spectrum of the embedded stellar clusters is assumed to be a power law , @xmath13 , with a slope @xmath14 @xcite . in accordance with the mass of the smallest star - forming stellar cluster known ( the tauris ",
    "auriga aggregate ) , we assumed @xmath15 , whereas the upper mass limit of the embedded cluster is a function of the sfr @xcite : @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "the latter relation was adapted by r14 from the original work of @xcite .",
    "it turns out from equation ( [ eq : imf ] ) that the overall [ fe / h ] dependence entirely resides in the slope of the imf of the high - mass range .",
    "the maximum stellar mass @xmath24 that can occur in the cluster and up to which the imf is sampled , is calculated according to the mass of the embedded cluster , @xmath19 ; furthermore , @xmath24 must be in any case smaller than the empirical limit , which here has been assumed to be @xmath25 ( see , for more details , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath26 relation is simply due to the fact that , in the case of very low sfrs , the small clusters may not have enough mass to give rise to very massive stars ; on the other hand , in the case of large sfrs , the maximum possible mass of the embedded clusters may be very large and so very massive stars are able to originate ( see r14 ) .",
    "so @xmath24 depends both on the sfr and , to a lesser extent , on the [ fe / h ] abundance of the parent galaxy .",
    "it is worth remarking that recent studies @xcite suggest that the star cluster imfs can become top - heavy at sfrs larger than @xmath27 m@xmath28 yr@xmath29 .",
    "this range of sfrs is clearly out of reach for sgr , therefore we have neglected this modification of the igimf theory in our study .    in fig .",
    "[ igimf ] , we show what is the effect of the dependence of the igimf upon the sfr . for very low sfrs ( @xmath30yr@xmath29 ) , the igimf turns out to be very much truncated and the maximum mass that can be formed strongly depends on the sfr .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in galaxies with a low sfr , the mass distribution function of the embedded clusters is truncated at low values of @xmath19 ( see equation [ eq : meclmax ] ) and small embedded clusters can not produce very massive stars .    in fig .",
    "[ m_max ] , we illustrate how @xmath24 is determined both by the sfr and by the [ fe / h ] abundance . the effect of the [ fe / h]-dependence is clearly opposite to that of the sfr - dependence .",

    "this can be also explained by looking at fig .",
    "[ ii ] , from which one can conclude that the @xcite imf predicts the highest core - collapse sn rates , whereas the igimf the lowest ones , over the entire galaxy lifetime .",
    "so in conclusion , given a particular value of the galaxy gas mass fraction @xmath116 , the @xcite imf predicts the highest metal content in the galaxy while the igimf predicts the lowest one .    in fig .",
    "[ eu_cescutti ] , we show the predictions of our models with the eu yields of @xcite for the [ eu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] abundance ratio patterns .",
    "we remind the reader that in this case the eu is assumed to be produced by core - collapse sne in the range @xmath45-@xmath46 and the stellar yields were determined ad hoc to reproduce the observational trend observed in the mw stars .",
    "we find that neither the igimf nor the classical imfs are able to reproduce the observed data set when adopting those yields .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that eu could be produced by core - collapse sne whose progenitors are less massive than the stars more important in oxygen production , which have masses @xmath117 .",
    "we tested this scenario in our chemical evolution model of the sgr dwarf .",
    "therefore , we have included in our models the eu yields by @xcite from core - collapse sne in the range @xmath118-@xmath48 . according to these yields , the eu",
    "is produced as an r - process element , with @xmath119 being the fraction of eu ejected by a star of mass @xmath120 .",
    "the results of the chemical evolution models which assume the yields of @xcite can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eu_ishimaru ] , where we show the [ eu / fe ] abundance ratio as a function of the [ fe / h ] abundances , as predicted by our models with different imfs . in that figure , we show also the results of models with the @xcite yields artificially increased by a factor of @xmath121 .",
    "we find that the models with the original @xcite yields are not able to reproduce [ eu / fe ] and [ eu / o ] at the same time .",
    "in fact , while the [ eu / fe ] ratios can be better explained by the models with the @xcite imf , because of the higher weight of the @xmath118-@xmath48 stars in this imf , the high [ eu / o ] ratios can not be reproduced even by the model with the igimf , which predicts a lack of o. by increasing the @xcite yields , we obtain a better result and , in principle , we could explain in this way the observed eu abundances in this galaxy .",
    "since the r - process nucleosynthesis is still debated in the literature , we also tested the case in which nsm events are the main responsible for the production of eu in galaxies , a hypothesis which has received a large interest recently ( e.g. @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ europium ] , the [ eu / fe ] and [ eu / o ] ratios as predicted by our models with @xmath122 ( thick lines ) are compared with the ones predicted by our models assuming @xmath123 ( thin lines ) , as in @xcite . in both cases , the truncation of the igimf strongly affects the predicted [ eu / o ] ratios , which are always higher than the [ eu / o ] ratios predicted with the standard imfs .",
    "our models with @xmath123 are still not able to reproduce the abundance ratios in the sgr dwarf .",
    "the choice of the @xmath123 derives from the best value quoted by matteucci et al .",
    "( 2014 ) to reproduce eu in the solar vicinity : however , the yields of eu per event can be as high as @xmath122 , in agreement with the upper limit of @xcite and with current calculations adopting more recent nuclear data ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with this value we can",
    "clearly better reproduce both the [ eu / fe ] and the [ eu / o ] abundance ratios observed in this galaxy .",
    "because of the mentioned still existing nucleosynthesis uncertainties and the small number of observations available for dsph galaxies and sgr galaxy in particular , our results can only safely demonstrate that the idea of @xcite is correct and that the [ eu / o ] ratio can be a possible diagnostic in future observations and studies of chemical evolution .",
    "in this context , we do not wish to explore all the possible combinations for eu production sites , as in @xcite where models including both core - collapse and nsms were considered .",
    "the paucity of data for sgr , in fact , prevents us from drawing any conclusions on eu produced in stars with mass as large as @xmath124 , leaving their chemical signature at low metallicities . for the same reason",
    ", we can not safely conclude anything about the time delay for the coalescence of neutron stars . to illustrate that , in fig .",
    "[ europium_tau ] , we show what is the effect on the predicted [ eu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relations of varying the delay time for coalescence from @xmath55 myr ( top figure ) to @xmath125 myr ( bottom figure )",
    ". we remark on the fact that these are extreme cases , given the uncertainty still present in the delay time for nsms ( see @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ abundance_ratios ] , we show also the abundance patterns of [ o / si ] . following the suggestions of @xcite ,",
    "the truncation of the imf can leave a signature in the hydrostatic over explosive @xmath0-element abundance ratios .",
    "the si is an explosive @xmath0-elements and its stellar yields are not affected by the truncation as much as those of oxygen . by looking at the figure ,",
    "the @xcite data for [ o / si ] are well reproduced with the igimf , supporting the idea that a truncated imf should be preferred in this galaxy .",
    "however , the data are still uncertain and prevent us from drawing firm conclusions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dispersion in the [ r - process / fe ] abundance ratios observed in the extreme metal - poor halo stars suggests that the frequency of r - process producers , per sn event , must be @xmath126 per cent @xcite .",
    "this could be considered as a support to the idea of nsms as eu producers , since nsm binaries are a small fraction of the number of core - collapse sn events ( we assume @xmath54 , as in @xcite ) .      in fig .",
    "[ var_nu ] , we explore the effect of changing the model parameter @xmath65 in the [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] abundance ratio patterns , when the metallicity - dependent igimf of r14 is assumed .",
    "the third dimension ( colour - coding ) in the figure corresponds to the sfrs under play and the parameter space that we explore is the one provided by @xcite , with the sf efficiencies continuously varying in the range @xmath127-@xmath75 gyr@xmath29 .",
    "we remark on the fact that @xcite assumed a @xcite imf .    by looking at fig .",
    "[ var_nu ] , by increasing the sf efficiency , it allows us to reach higher [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios as well as higher sfrs at a fixed [ fe / h ] abundance .",
    "furthermore , the models with @xmath85 gyr@xmath29 and @xmath86 gyr@xmath29 with the @xcite and @xcite imfs predict always higher [ @xmath0/fe ] abundances than the models calculated with the igimf .",
    "this is due to the extremely low efficiency of formation of massive stars when the igimf is assumed for galaxies with very low sfrs .",
    "the effect of changing the wind parameter @xmath76 is much lower than varying the sf efficiency @xmath65 .",
    "for a fixed value of the sf efficiency , the time of the onset of the galactic wind as well as the [ fe / h ] ratio of the ism at that epoch are always the same .",
    "so different values of the @xmath76 parameter affect the chemical evolution only after the onset of the galactic wind .",

    "we find that the models with the @xcite set of stellar yields agree very well in the predicted [ o / fe ] and [ si / fe ] abundance ratios with the models which include the recent yields of the chieffi and limongi group . on the other hand",
    ", there is still quite a large uncertainty in the stellar yields of mg and ca , which affect the results of our models for these two chemical elements ; in particular , the final results for [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] may differ by almost @xmath160 dex .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we explored also the combined effect of different imf and stellar yield assumptions .",
    "we find that the effect of assuming different stellar yields is almost similar for [ o / fe ] and [ si / fe ] , if we assume the @xcite or the @xcite imfs .",
    "on the other hand , when assuming the igimf , we find that our models become on average more influenced by the assumed stellar yields .",
    "in this paper , we have tested the effects of different imfs on the chemical evolution of sgr dwarf galaxy .",
    "in particular , we have considered the igimf of r14 , which depends on the metallicity and sfr , and the invariant @xcite and @xcite imfs .",
    "we have run several models by studying the effect of the various parameters , such as the efficiency of sf and the wind parameter .",
    "we have compared different scenarios for the production of eu . in particular , we have considered the recent nsm scenario of @xcite and the canonical scenario in which eu is produced by core - collapse sne .    finally , we have studied the effect of different stellar yield assumptions on the predicted abundance ratio patterns in this galaxy and we have explored also the combined effect of varying both the imf and the stellar yield assumptions .    in what follows ,",
    "we summarize the main conclusions of our work .    1 .",
    "the igimf tends to predict lower [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ eu / fe ] ratios in objects with low sfr than the classical @xcite and @xcite imfs .",
    "in fact , in the case of the igimf , there is a deficiency in the formation of massive stars , which are the main contributors of the @xmath0-elements .",
    "the dependence of the igimf on the sfr is much stronger than that on the metallicity , which in fact could be neglected .",
    "our results support the conclusion that the time - delay model is necessary to explain the trend of the [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ eu / fe ] ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] ; furthermore , the assumption of a truncated imf such as the igimf provides a better qualitative agreement with the abundance ratio patterns observed in the sgr galaxy , although both the data and the stellar yields that we assume in our models are still too uncertain to draw firm conclusions .",
    "it is worth recalling that the effect of changing the imf consists mainly in shifting the [ @xmath7/fe ] ( with @xmath7 the abundance of a generic element ) curves up or down along the @xmath8-axis , whereas the shape of the [ @xmath7/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] curves is mainly determined by the lifetimes of the stellar producers of @xmath7 and fe and by the star formation history ( time - delay model ) .",
    "the oxygen is the hydrostatic @xmath0-element which is most sensitive to the cut - off in mass of the imf , while the explosive @xmath0-elements such as the silicon and the calcium are much less sensitive .",
    "so the hydrostatic over explosive @xmath0-element abundance ratios can retain a well - defined signature of a truncated imf , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the o and si are among the chemical elements which are less affected by uncertainties relative to their stellar yields ; the results of our models , in particular the comparison of the [ o / si ] versus [ fe / h ] relations predicted by our models with the @xcite data , might support the idea that the imf in the sgr galaxy is truncated , with the igimf being the favourite among the different imfs here explored .",
    "however , again , the data are still too uncertain to draw firm conclusions .",
    "all our models with eu coming from core - collapse sne are not able to reproduce the [ eu / fe ] and [ eu / o ] abundance ratios at the same time , unless the yields from stars in the range @xmath118-@xmath48 are artificially increased by a factor of @xmath161 . when including the eu produced by nsms as the only source of this element , we are also able to well match the data , by assuming yields as suggested by recent calculations @xcite .",
    "since nsms , which are nowadays considered as more promising sites for eu production , arise from stars which have an initial mass in a lower range than that of the most important oxygen producers , the hypothesis of @xcite remains true .",
    "furthermore , we confirm that in sgr the truncation of the imf might have played a relevant role in the [ eu / o ] versus [ fe / h ] relations , while the [ eu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] is due mainly to the time - delay model .",
    "5 .   by exploring the parameter space , and in particular by studying the effect of the star formation and galactic wind efficiencies",
    ", we found that the major role in determining the final abundance pattern in sgr galaxy is played by the star formation efficiency , while the wind parameter has only a small effect .",
    "the imfs considered here are all able to reproduce the present time observed total hi mass . on the other hand",
    ", the model with the igimf predicts final total stellar masses which are slightly larger than the ones predicted by the models with the classical imfs .",
    "this is probably due to the delayed onset of the galactic wind in igimf models , because of the reduced energetic feedback from massive stars .",
    "the galaxy forms stars for a longer period and thus a large mass in long - living , low - mass stars can accumulate .",
    "the present results can be useful to study also other dsphs , since the history of these galaxies is characterized by a low sfr , which implies a truncated imf in the formalism of the igimf theory . in a forthcoming paper , we will discuss the chemical evolution of fornax .",
    "our last comment is that combining the chemical evolution models with the spectro - photometric ones might greatly help to better constrain the role and the effect of the igimf in the evolution of galaxies and that will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
