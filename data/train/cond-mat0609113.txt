    "under fast enough cooling or densification , materials which are as diverse as molecular and polymeric liquids , colloidal suspensions , granular assemblies and molten mixtures of metallic atoms , may form glasses  @xcite .",
    "these are amorphous states that may be characterized mechanically as a solid , but lack long - range crystalline order . despite all the work devoted to the subject , the mechanisms responsible for the vitrification processes are not well understood , and the transition to the glassy state remains one of the most controversial problems in condensed matter physics .    in a recent paper  @xcite , using an effective potential method , a replica formalism has been set up to describe supercooled liquids .",
    "this approach shows that the thermodynamics of these systems near their glass transition temperature @xmath0 is equivalent , in the sense of `` universality classes '' , to that of ising spin glasses in a magnetic field @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "spin - glass droplet scaling ideas  @xcite were used to discuss the consequent expected glass phenomenology .",
    "this approach would be appropriate if the lengthscales of cooperatively rearranging regions near @xmath2 were many times larger than the intermolecular separation .",
    "in fact , recent studies  @xcite have indicated that this lengthscale is rather modest and only a few intermolecular distances . as a consequence , glasses are not really in the regime where droplet scaling ideas are appropriate .",
    "we shall therefore examine in this paper the glass phenomenology which arises when the correlation length is not large but instead is in the precursor regime to the droplet scaling limit .",
    "rather to our surprise , we are able to find in this regime all the characteristic features of glass phenomenology such as the vogel - fulcher relation  @xcite , the kauzmann temperature  @xcite , the adam - gibbs relation  @xcite , etc ...    we shall study in particular the edwards - anderson ( ea ) ising spin glass model  @xcite in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath1 both in one dimension ( @xmath3 ) and in three dimensions ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the behavior in both dimensions is similar , but the @xmath3 case can be studied more thoroughly as its equilibrium properties can be determined exactly by means of a renormalization group approach , and its dynamical properties are accessible via monte carlo simulations . even in the @xmath3 case ,",
    "the model is able to mimic most of the experimental observations on supercooled liquids .",
    "an apparent kauzmann paradox  @xcite is found , accompanied by a growing ( but still modest at the fields which we use ) lengthscale @xmath5 and by an apparent divergence of the relaxation time as in the vogel - fulcher ( vf ) equation with @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "there is thus an apparent thermodynamical and dynamical singularity at a finite temperature @xmath7 , but it is not a true transition .",
    "@xmath7 is just a crossover temperature such that when @xmath8 the growth of @xmath5 as @xmath9 decreases has largely ceased .",
    "the @xmath4 case can not be solved exactly but has been studied within the migdal - kadanoff approximation ( mka )  @xcite , and a similar glass phenomenology emerges .",
    "but there are some significant difference between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases , due to the fact in @xmath3 there is no finite temperature spin glass transition , but only a diverging lengthscale as @xmath10 when @xmath11 , whereas in @xmath4 , there is in zero field a finite temperature transition and so in order to have a lengthscale of only a few intermolecular diameters at low temperatures , a large field has to be applied .",
    "our work within the mka in @xmath4 does not provide a quantitatively accurate picture , but the results are so encouraging that it would seem worthwhile to attempt to get more quantitative results , probably by use of monte carlo methods .",
    "unfortunately glass timescales are so long compared to molecular collision timescales that realistic simulations will be challenging .",
    "the investigations presented here suggest a new framework to understand glass behavior : features of the intermolecular potential and the density determine the value of the field @xmath1 and the temperature scale , but once these are fixed there is sufficient universality left near the glass transition @xmath2 that the mapping to ising spin glasses in a field provides a semi - quantitative account of both the thermodynamic properties of glasses and those dynamical features which can be undestood in terms of flipping and cooperative rearranging of spin domains of linear extent @xmath5 sitting in a random effective magnetic field , requiring free energy activation over barriers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] we solve the ea ising spin glass in an external magnetic field in one dimension by using a decimation approach and we study its dynamical properties by performing monte carlo simulations ; we then discuss the connection to the phenomenology of glasses . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] we examine the three dimensional case , by means of the migdal - kadanoff approximation . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we present some concluding remarks .",
    "the ea ising spin glass hamiltonian in @xmath3 in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field reads : @xmath12 where the spins @xmath13 can take values @xmath14 , and the nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath15 are independent of each other and gaussianly distributed with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath16 . in principle",
    "@xmath1 could be a function of temperature but we shall regard it as a temperature independent constant , whose magnitude is chosen both in @xmath3 and @xmath4 so that the low - temperature spin glass correlation length @xmath5 is of the order of a few lattice spacings and so is comparable to the glass correlation length of real glasses at @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the free energy of the system by using an iterative real - space renormalization group technique  @xcite .",
    "it consists in tracing out every other spin in the system , thereby generating new effective interactions between the remaining spins which sit in new magnetic fields : @xmath17 } \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\,\\,\\ , = e^ { w_{i+1}^{(n+1 ) } + \\beta \\left [ j_i^{(n+1 ) } \\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+2 } + h_i^{(n+1 ) } \\sigma_i + h_{i+2}^{(n+1 ) } \\sigma_{i+2 } \\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the @xmath18-th step in the decimation process , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , have probability distributions , which evolve with the iteration . in @xmath3",
    ", the ea model has a genuine critical point at @xmath21 , corresponding to a non - trivial fixed point of the recursion relations .",
    "conversely , at any finite temperature and magnetic field , the system evolves toward a trivial `` random paramagnetic '' fixed point : the variance of the effective couplings decreases under iteration and approaches zero , whereas the effective magnetic fields have a distribution which approaches a gaussian , with mean @xmath1 ( i.e. , the initial value of the magnetic field ) , and variance @xmath22 .    for each realization of the quenched disorder , the free energy , @xmath23 , can be determined exactly by summing the spin - independent terms , @xmath24 , which are generated at each step of the decimation  @xcite . once the average over the disorder is taken , @xmath25_j$ ] ,",
    "the entropy density is obtained using @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d]a the entropy is plotted versus the temperature for three different value of the magnetic field , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the figure shows a temperature range in which the entropy decreases linearly , and would be extrapolated to vanish at @xmath30 as @xmath31,\\ ] ] demonstrating that the model has a `` kauzmann paradox '' similar to that observed in supercooled liquids .",
    "however , below a crossover temperature , @xmath32 , the entropy deviates from linearity and does not vanish completely except at @xmath33 .    by computing the derivative of the free energy with respect to the variation of the magnetic field on two different sites ,",
    "it is possible to evaluated the equilibrium connected correlation function : @xmath34 > from the exponential decay of the correlation function , @xmath35_j \\sim \\exp ( - l / \\xi ) $ ] , we extract the equilibrium correlation length of the system , @xmath5 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d]b for the same values of the magnetic field as before .",
    "@xmath5 increases as the temperature is decreased but at low enough temperatures ( @xmath36 ) , it bends over and approaches a finite value at @xmath33 , proportional to @xmath37 , as predicted by the droplet picture  @xcite on equating the energy to flip a domain of size @xmath5 to the magnetic field energy which could be gained , @xmath38 , and for @xmath39 , @xmath40 .    in order to establish a connection with the dynamical features of glass - forming liquids , we have studied the dynamical properties of the @xmath3 model by performing monte carlo simulations of a system of @xmath41 spins .",
    "we have computed the spin - spin cumulant auto - correlation function , defined as : @xmath42_j.\\ ] ] for large enough waiting times , @xmath43 , the system reach stationarity , characterised by time transitional invariance , i.e. , @xmath44 . although the mapping established in ref .",
    "@xcite is explicit only for equilibrium quantities and might not extend to dynamical features , we find that , in analogy with glass - formers , @xmath45 is very well fitted by a stretched exponential form , @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 is the system relaxation time . the spin - spin auto - correlation function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : relax ] for several values of the temperature .",
    "the relaxation time is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d]d for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 as a function of the temperature .",
    "similarly to what happens in supercooled liquids  @xcite a vogel - fulcher law , @xmath48 is able to fit quite accurately the data for each value of the magnetic field ( over @xmath49-@xmath50 decades ) , with the vf temperature , @xmath51 , set equal to the kauzmann temperature , @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "again , the dynamical singularity is only apparent , since the relaxation time diverges only at @xmath33 according to an arrhenius law . at low enough temperature @xmath53",
    "deviates from the vf law .",
    "such a departure starts to emerge for @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , the onset of the deviation from the vf fit seems to coincide with the crossover temperature @xmath56 at which the entropy deviates from linearity .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the adam - gibbs ( ag ) relation  @xcite , @xmath57 , which holds in the temperature range explored by the simulations , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : relax ] .",
    "the original derivation  @xcite of the ag equation relies on the assumption of the existence of correlated regions of size @xmath5 rearranging cooperatively , and on the hypothesis that @xmath58 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d]c , this relation seems to hold in the intermediate temperature window explored in the simulations , whereas it breaks down below @xmath56",
    ".    one might wonder whether the whole entropy , @xmath59 , which we have calculated , plays the role of the `` configurational entropy '' for supercooled liquids in the ag relation .",
    "when @xmath60 , the thermodynamics is dominated by the flipping of the few single spins for which the local field is comparable to @xmath9 . for @xmath61 ,",
    "the thermodynamics is dominated by the excitation of `` droplets '' of size @xmath5 .",
    "hence it is tempting to regard the very low temperature entropy in our spin glass simulations as being the contribution to the entropy from a single state , and that the configurational entropy is that which arises when many droplets are thermally excited .",
    "we have studied also the `` configurational entropy '' which is obtained by subtracting from @xmath59 the linear contribution which fits the very low temperature entropy .",
    "however , the same qualitative results were found with this definition of @xmath59 .    due to the success of the ag relation ,",
    "it is natural to expect that the dynamics of the system will be dominated by the flipping of spin domains of size @xmath5 . since the variance of the the effective couplings decreases under iteration and approaches zero after a few iteration steps ,",
    "whereas the effective magnetic fields are gaussianly distributed with mean @xmath1 and variance @xmath22 , one might guess that the dynamics of the system is equivalent to that of a chain of non - interacting spin domains of linear extent proportional to @xmath5 , sitting in a random external field .",
    "notice that this situation has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . taking into account the time to pass a spin flip through the domain , which involves the breaking of the largest bond in the domain",
    "whose magnitude will be denoted by @xmath62 , the time to reverse each spin domain will be of the form @xmath63 $ ] . if the distribution of the @xmath62 is also gaussian , the distribution of the sum @xmath64 will be another gaussian of variance @xmath65 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this leads to the following expressions for the relaxation time @xmath66 $ ] and for the stretching exponent @xmath67^{-1/2}$ ] , with a constant @xmath68 .",
    "we have verified that these formula work quite well in describing the dynamics of the system in one dimension ( with @xmath69 ) . nevertheless , they are not _ perfect _ : the constant @xmath70 is bigger than one ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 is too small",
    ". these discrepancies could be because the time it takes to flip the spins by breaking the largest bond on a line of spins of length @xmath5 has not been handled with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the largest bond has its own probability distribution , which is just not a gaussian .",
    "a full theory would be complicated .",
    "however , in @xmath4 much bigger values of the external field have to be taken to keep the magnitude of the correlation length only a few lattice spacings at low temperatures , so one could reasonably expect that the relaxation time is dominated just by the random fields alone .",
    "the fragility @xmath73 , and the kauzmann temperature @xmath7 ( see eq .  ( [ eq : vtf ] ) ) are both affected by the magnetic field , @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath73 decreases as @xmath1 is increased ( i.e. , stronger glasses are described by bigger fields ) , whereas @xmath7 ( and @xmath56 ) increases as @xmath1 is increased . in the main frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : frag ] , the dependence of @xmath7 on the fragility is plotted .",
    "we also plot the behavior of another two important quantities : the jump in the specific heat @xmath74 and the stretching exponent @xmath75 ( at @xmath76 ) .",
    "the former can be estimated by ( arbitrarily ) setting @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 , @xmath79 being the slope of the entropy in the linear regime [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dentr ] ) ] ; the latter can be directly computed from numerical simulations .",
    "interestingly enough , @xmath75 is found to be an increasing function of @xmath73 , whereas @xmath74 decreases as @xmath73 increases , in agreement with observations on supercooled liquids  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath4 case , which is most relevant for real supercooled liquids .",
    "we have evaluated the free energy of the ea spin glass model in a field by means of the mk approximation , a real - space renormalization group techniques that gives approximate recursion relations for the flow of the coupling constants and magnetic fields distributions  @xcite .",
    "we have used the `` bond moving '' procedure , where the bonds on the @xmath4 lattice are moved before each decimation step , so that no higher order couplings are generated  @xcite : in a @xmath80-dimensional lattice , @xmath81 bonds are superimposed and added up , whereas the `` naked '' spins that are left behind have no couplings . taking",
    "the trace over the spins that are on the main bonds leads to the coupling constants , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1drg ] ) , between neighboring spins on the coarse - grained lattice .",
    "the decimation procedure is iterated @xmath18 times on a lattice of size @xmath82 .",
    "there is a flexibility in the mk renormalization scheme as to how the fields are moved .",
    "we have treated the field terms as belonging to bonds : when a bond is moved we also move all its field terms to the end that is to be traced over next  @xcite .    in @xmath4 , within the mka , when @xmath11 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the variance of the effective couplings grows indefinitely under iteration . for finite values of the magnetic field",
    "there is no evidence of a de almeida - thouless line  @xcite .",
    "the variance of the couplings might grow initially for low enough fields and/or temperatures , but it always decreases and eventually vanishes after a sufficient number of iteration steps , just like in @xmath3 .",
    "the average value of the field distribution equals the initial value of the uniform magnetic field , @xmath1 , whereas the width of the distribution saturates at a finite value , @xmath22 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the entropy per spin and the correlation length @xmath5 , obtained within the mka from the exponential decay of the variance of the effective coupling , @xmath85 , which decreases as @xmath86 at large @xmath18 , are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig:3dentropy]a and  [ fig:3dentropy]b for @xmath87 , showing a scenario very similar to that found in @xmath3 : there is a temperature range in which the entropy per site , @xmath59 , is linear and is extrapolated to vanish at a finite kauzmann temperature , @xmath7 ; a crossover occurs at a higher temperature @xmath56 , where the entropy deviates from linear behavior .",
    "the correlation length , @xmath5 , grows as the temperature is decreased and approaches a finite value at @xmath33 .",
    "we also mention that , similarly to the @xmath3 case , there is a modest range of values of the external magnetic field @xmath1 ( for @xmath88 ) for which the ag relation , @xmath89 , holds in the temperature region @xmath90 .",
    "this ag relation , however , breaks down below @xmath56 and at high temperatures and in contrast to the @xmath3 case is of less utility .    due to the magnitude of the relaxation times , standard monte carlo simulations of the @xmath4 model",
    "are more challenging than in the @xmath3 case , and we will leave them for future investigations .",
    "however , since the values of interest of the magnetic field are much bigger than in @xmath3 , one can surmise that the flipping of a spin domain of size @xmath5 sitting in a random external magnetic field gaussianly distributed and with variance @xmath91 are the dominant dynamical processes ; hence , the energy barriers involved in such processes might account reasonably well for the system s relaxation time , leading to @xmath92  @xcite . following this hypothesis ,",
    "we have verified that @xmath93 $ ] can be well fitted by a vf law with @xmath6 for @xmath94 . from the vf fit of this quantity",
    "it is also possible to extract the fragility , @xmath73 , in the @xmath4 case . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : frag ] , @xmath7 and @xmath74 are plotted as a function of @xmath73 , showing they have very similar behavior to that found in @xmath3 .",
    "the domain size @xmath5 according to droplet scaling is given by equating the cost of flipping a droplet of size @xmath5 , @xmath95 , to the field energy which might be gained , @xmath96 .",
    "as in @xmath4 the exponent @xmath97 is small , ( @xmath98 )  @xcite , it follows that @xmath99 , which implies that the ag relation @xmath100 should hold .",
    "the stetching exponent @xmath75 would be expected to be @xmath101^{-1/2}$ ] , provided again that the time taken to pass the domain wall through the domain is not significant .",
    "one feature of the mka study in 3d is that the configurational entropy seems to be smaller than the quoted values near the glass transition , perhaps by as much as a factor of @xmath102 @xcite . in the derivation of the mapping to spin glasses @xcite",
    "one can see that the field @xmath1 will be a function of both the temperature and density , rather than simply being a temperature independent constant as we have assumed here throughout for simplicity . allowing for this temperature dependence could significantly change the entropy .",
    "for example suppose @xmath103 , then the high - temperature limit of the entropy is @xmath104 $ ] , and by adjusting @xmath105 , can be made as large as desired .",
    "the mapping between supercooled liquids and spin glasses in an external magnetic field , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , thus seems to provide a semi - quantitative explanation of the properties of supercooled liquids including the kauzmann paradox , the vogel - fulcher behavior of the relaxation time , the stretched exponential decays of correlation functions , a growing lengthscale , and the adam - gibbs relation in the regime @xmath106 , which is the precursor regime accessed by the experiments , where the correlation length is growing with temperature but is still only a few intermolecular distances . the droplet scaling limit studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is appropriate only when the correlation length is much bigger than this .",
    "the large timescales which exist below the glass transition temperature @xmath0 prohibit the taking of equilibrium data below it and so the apparent thermodynamic and dynamical singularities at @xmath7 can not be accessed .",
    "in our scenario , @xmath7 is only a crossover temperature at which the growing correlation length saturates to a constant value .",
