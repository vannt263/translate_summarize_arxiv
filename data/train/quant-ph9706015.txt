    "<S> the equality in ( [ eq:3 ] ) is reached by any gaussian function and moreover these are the unique minimizers  @xcite . since the gaussian can be taken centered at the origin , the same sharp bound holds in the subspace of even functions . </S>",

    "<S> such question would arise , for instance , in the case of two electrons in a triplet spin state since the relative coordinate wave function must be odd . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will address this problem in the one dimensional case , @xmath17 . for future reference </S>",
    "<S> , we will denote the functional @xmath18 by @xmath19 and the subspace of the odd functions in @xmath20 by @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we seek to find the infimum of @xmath22 in the space @xmath21 , and also to establish the form of the possible minimizers , or , more generally , of the minimizing sequences .    </S>",
    "<S> quite likely the problem just raised is non trivial if treated in a fully rigorous mathematical manner . in 1957 </S>",
    "<S> it was noted by hirschman ( in the one dimensional case ) that the l.h.s . of ( [ eq:3 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is non negative ; this result follows from the classical hausdorff - young inequality ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , he then conjectured that the sharp bound was attained by gaussian functions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was not until 1975 that beckner  @xcite , motivated by preliminary results of babenko  @xcite , established the necessary sharp version of hausdorff - young inequality from which hirschman - beckner inequality ( [ eq:3 ] ) immediately follows . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the problem of finding sharp bounds in restricted classes of functions , such as linear subspaces , seems to have deserved less or not attention at all . </S>",
    "<S> given the difficulty of the problem , we have adopted here an exploratory approach in order to gather `` experimental '' information on the minimizing function , namely , by numerically minimizing the entropy functional . from the point of view of rigorous mathematical results , this procedure can only yield upper bounds on the sharp bound , nevertheless it can provide useful insights and help to make reasonably founded conjectures on the form of the minimizers . </S>",
    "<S> such conjectures are presented below .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly describe the numerical procedure used . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the expansion of the elements of @xmath20 in terms of the orthonormal harmonic oscillator basis @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the associated hermite polynomials . </S>",

    "<S> we actually consider the following @xmath32-dimensional subspace of @xmath21 @xmath33 for @xmath32 as large as possible , then make use of standard numerical algorithms to look for the minimum of @xmath19 in this space . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical minimization algorithms become less efficient as @xmath32 increases , thus implying a maximum admissible value for @xmath32 in practice . </S>",
    "<S> the largest space used was that corresponding to @xmath34 , which , of course , yielded the best ( i.e. , the lowest ) entropy , namely , @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this number , as well as the minimizing functions itself , is only very weakly dependent on the minimization method used ( e.g. a steepest descend or a simplex algorithm ) , the precise value of @xmath32 and the initial conditions used . </S>",
    "<S> also , we have checked that the gaussian minimum @xmath36 is correctly reproduced if even as well as odd functions are allowed . </S>",
    "<S> it turned out that imposing the conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 did not result in an increase of the entropy . </S>",
    "<S> analogous restrictions can be imposed on the gaussian minimizer in the subspace of even functions . </S>",
    "<S> the minimizing function ( for @xmath34 and the above mentioned restrictions ) is shown in figure  1 .    motivated by the numerical results , we define the following two one - parameter families of functions , @xmath39 where the parameter @xmath40 takes positive values . note that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are two unrelated functions ; the symbol @xmath43 is used to distinguish them and it does not denote a derivative . </S>",
    "<S> our preliminary ansatz is that the small @xmath40 limit of @xmath41 ( or equivalently of @xmath42 ) corresponds to a minimizer of @xmath22 in @xmath21 . under this assumption , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical curve shown in figure  1 would be a regularized approximation to the small @xmath40 limit of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the numerical curve coincides almost perfectly with @xmath41 or @xmath44 for @xmath45 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq:5 ] ) , similar to value of @xmath32 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4 ] ) .    for convenience we will refer to @xmath46 and @xmath47 as sequences since it is always possible to choose a positive sequence @xmath48 with @xmath49 so that @xmath50 is a sequence in the usual sense . strictly speaking the limits as @xmath51 of the @xmath46 or @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> do not take place within @xmath20 , i.e. in norm . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , their point - wise limit is 0 except at the points @xmath53 , where they take the value 1 , whereas their norms @xmath54 and @xmath55 converge to @xmath56 , as will be shown below . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the limit of @xmath57 is 0 , thus both sequences @xmath46 and @xmath52 become equivalent for small @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> we will introduce the following notation . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath58 be a normed vector space , and let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be two sequences in @xmath58 ( in the sense @xmath51 and @xmath40 taking positive values ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will say that they strongly approach each other if @xmath61 , and this will be denoted by @xmath62 or @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that the sequences are not assumed to be cauchy sequences , hence nothing is implied for the limits of @xmath64 or @xmath65 as @xmath66 and @xmath67 independently approach @xmath68 . from the triangle inequality </S>",
    "<S> it follows that this is an equivalence relation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if @xmath63 , it follows that @xmath69 , since @xmath70 in @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is proved in lemma 1 below .    </S>",
    "<S> the word `` limit '' applied to the sequences @xmath46 and @xmath52 is used here only in an improper sense . </S>",
    "<S> the strict statement , if correct , would be that @xmath46 is a minimizing sequence in @xmath21 , that is , one that approaches the infimum of @xmath22 in @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation , to be discussed in more detail later , shows that @xmath71 , therefore we formulate the following conjecture :    * conjecture 1 . * _ the infimum of the functional @xmath22 in @xmath21 is @xmath72 . _    </S>",
    "<S> our best numerical value for @xmath22  ( @xmath73 ) is only slightly above @xmath72 ( @xmath74 ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us make some remarks on the form of the assumed minimizing sequence and its improper limit @xmath75 . both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are odd and real functions and moreover @xmath76 and vice versa , thus @xmath77 in @xmath20 ( and also point - wise ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 is formed by a set of localized states arranged antisymmetrically around 0 and distributed equidistantly through the real line . </S>",
    "<S> the small scale structures ( the so called ultraviolet region in physics ) are narrow gaussian functions , namely , @xmath78 . likewise , the large scale structure ( infrared region ) is a wide gaussian function centered at the origin , i.e , @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> . we will refer to this overall arrangement as a singular `` bi - gaussian '' function . as it will be shown below </S>",
    "<S> , the double gaussian structure of the minimizer @xmath75 is directly responsible for the fact that @xmath72 is twice the infimum of @xmath22 in @xmath20 , which is saturated by a ( simple ) gaussian function . as we will recall in a moment , minimizing @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> is equivalent to maximize the fourier transform operator . for any linear operator from @xmath80 into @xmath81 with a gaussian kernel </S>",
    "<S> , lieb has shown that the ( unrestricted ) maximizer , if any , must be a gaussian function  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subspace @xmath21 does not contain such functions , yet it seems that nevertheless a kind of gaussian , to wit , a bi - gaussian function , is the maximizer also in this case . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable how even the seemingly simple constraint @xmath82 yields a quite unexpected result , which however is full of structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the sharp bound @xmath83 on the entropy @xmath22 follows from computing the norm of the fourier transform operator @xmath9 considered as a linear operator from the space @xmath80 into its dual @xmath81 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we can define a new functional as @xmath86 @xmath87 vanishes at @xmath88 , since @xmath9 is unitary in @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the functional @xmath87 is related to the @xmath22 by @xmath89 where the derivative is a right derivative . </S>",
    "<S> following hirschman s argument , let @xmath90 denote the norm of the operator @xmath9 restricted to a subspace @xmath58 of @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath91 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:8 ] ) and using @xmath92 , it follows @xmath93 as first proved by beckner  @xcite , the infimum in @xmath80 is reached by gaussian functions and thus @xmath94 . in view of conjecture 1 </S>",
    "<S> , it is natural to make the stronger assumption    * conjecture 2 . * _ the norm of the linear operator @xmath9 from the space @xmath95 of odd functions of @xmath96 into @xmath97 , with @xmath98 , is @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the infimum of @xmath87 in @xmath95 is @xmath100 . _    </S>",
    "<S> conjecture 1 follows from this one . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation to be detailed below shows that the sequences @xmath46 and @xmath52 yield the value @xmath101 as @xmath40 goes to 0 , thus , according to this conjecture , they are minimizing sequences also for @xmath87 in @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> conjectures 1 and 2 settle the point ( or , more properly , open the question ) of the infimum of @xmath22 and @xmath87 in @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> as noted , we do not expect a strict minimizer of @xmath87 to exist and we have instead to consider minimizing sequences , i.e. such that @xmath102 . to address this point and the related problem of uniqueness , and also to give further support to the conjectures </S>",
    "<S> , we will now turn to a more detailed study of the bi - gaussian ansatzs @xmath41 and @xmath42 and their admissible generalizations .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath103 denote the class of distributions , @xmath104 of the form @xmath105 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath106 is dirac s delta function . </S>",
    "<S> further , let @xmath107 be a function in @xmath108 . then </S>",
    "<S> , for each @xmath109 we will associate to @xmath107 two functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 in @xmath96 by means of the relations @xmath112 we will use the notations @xmath113 and @xmath114 to the denote the defining constructions of @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively . rather than state the more general conditions on @xmath107 for the above definitions to make sense , we will restrict @xmath107 to the schwartz space of fast decreasing @xmath115 functions , on which the tempered distributions are defined . </S>",
    "<S> this space will be denoted by @xmath116 , and will be considered as a subspace of @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> it has several useful properties : it is dense in @xmath108 , is invariant under fourier transform , and their elements are sufficiently regular for our purposes , in particular , the defining series of @xmath110 and @xmath111 exist and are absolutely and uniformly convergent for given @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> both definitions are related by using either @xmath117 or @xmath118 as the first argument of @xmath107 </S>",
    "<S> . we will be interested throughout in the limit of small positive @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> in this limit , and for each @xmath13 , the terms @xmath119 and @xmath120 vanish unless @xmath121 is of order @xmath40 , thus both definitions become equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , they strongly approach each other as @xmath40 goes to 0 , i.e. @xmath122 this statement is meaningful since the normalizations of @xmath110 and @xmath111 are well - defined ; they have finite @xmath5-norm as @xmath40 goes to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is proved in lemma 1 and proposition 1 below .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the best way of understanding the constructions @xmath110 and @xmath111 is to consider the case of a separable function @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of @xmath110 corresponds to make a convolution of @xmath124 with @xmath125 and then multiply by @xmath126 , whereas in @xmath111 the multiplication is performed in the first place and the convolution is done next . in the limit of small @xmath40 both operations commute , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , @xmath127 . </S>",

    "<S> the bi - gaussian ansatzs @xmath41 and @xmath42 are of the form @xmath113 and @xmath132 with @xmath133 i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the small @xmath40 limit of @xmath110 or @xmath111 does not take place in @xmath96 , nevertheless , after an appropriate renormalization , there is a weak limit as a distribution , namely @xmath135 where the constant @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from considering the integrals @xmath137 or @xmath138 for an arbitrary test function @xmath139 , after the change of variables @xmath140 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us compute the @xmath5-norm of @xmath110 in the limit @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> since in this limit the overlap among different terms of the defining series of @xmath110 is negligible , for each value of @xmath141 at most one term of the series is relevant . </S>",

    "<S> the improper minimizer @xmath75 is invariant under complex conjugation and fourier transform but breaks dilatation and normalization invariances ( as also does any non trivial function in @xmath14 ) . in physics language , these two symmetries are spontaneously broken . </S>",
    "<S> a similar statement can be made for the gaussian minimizers in @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark , however , that the group of symmetries generated by transformations _ ( i)-(iv ) _ does not act transitively on the set of minimizers of @xmath22 in @xmath20 , since complex ( rather than real ) affine transformations would needed to connect two arbitrary gaussian functions . likewise </S>",
    "<S> , the previous symmetries applied to @xmath75 do not exhaust the set of minimizers , and in fact the symmetry group in @xmath176 is even larger ; e.g. two independent dilatations applied to @xmath124 and @xmath107 still define an symmetry transformation which acts effectively on @xmath210 ( always meaning in the limit of small @xmath40 for which @xmath210 has been defined ) .    in passing , note that under a dilatation @xmath211 , ( @xmath212 positive ) , the quantities @xmath213 , @xmath167 , @xmath214 and @xmath166 scale as @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus the quantities @xmath201 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 are dilatation invariant , as they should .    </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , the sequence @xmath46 is not convergent in @xmath96 and it can not be made convergent by a suitable ( @xmath40-dependent ) renormalization of @xmath41 since its weak limit is the singular distribution @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is not a cauchy sequence ; two elements @xmath221 and @xmath222 need not be near each other in the strong topology , even for arbitrarily small values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the sequence does not even approach itself in the mean and hence a precise definition is needed to state that some other minimizing sequence must approach this one . </S>",
    "<S> besides , note that given a minimizing sequence , one can apply independent arbitrary symmetry transformations for each value of @xmath40 and still have a minimizing sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a minimizing sequence needs not approach strongly @xmath46 or more generally @xmath223 for fixed ( i.e. @xmath40-independent ) @xmath124 and @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical calculation shows that the infimum in @xmath21 can be achieved in the subspace @xmath224 , whereas that corresponding to the subspace @xmath225 is larger . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that fourier transform invariance is not spontaneously broken , that is , that after an appropriate dilatation , the minimizer can be brought to the space @xmath224 ( note that @xmath9 is not invariant under dilatations ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the problem of minimizing @xmath22 in @xmath20 ; a minimizer ( a gaussian ) is not necessarily an even function , but it can be brought to one after a suitable translation . in the case of @xmath95 , </S>",
    "<S> not existing a true minimizer , it is important to specify in which sense the minimizer must satisfy the condition @xmath226 ( assuming our conjecture of unbroken fourier transform invariance to hold ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can expect that the condition is satisfied in the weak sense . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that @xmath227 weakly converges to @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> it can not be expected , however , to hold in strong sense for an arbitrary minimizing sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen noting that every centered gaussian @xmath107 , together with @xmath124 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:13 ] ) , would yield a minimizing sequence in @xmath95 . by a centered gaussian , </S>",
    "<S> it is meant a function of the form @xmath228 , where @xmath32 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath220 are complex numbers , @xmath32 is non vanishing and the real part of @xmath231 is a positive definite quadratic form . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath191 is an antisymmetric bi - gaussian function . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath232 , whose norm ( from corollary 1 ) does not go to 0 unless @xmath233 , and this equality does not hold for an arbitrary centered gaussian @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> another consideration follows from noting that the information entropy @xmath234 of @xmath124 is undefined ; each single delta function has entropy minus infinity since they correspond to a maximal localization , however , the fact that this localization can occur in any of the points @xmath235 with equal probability adds a plus infinity to the entropy yielding a undefined value . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the value of @xmath22 or @xmath87 for a sequence in @xmath176 depends not only on its weak limit , @xmath124 , but also on the particular shape of the functions : the true minimizer must be gaussian - like .    perhaps it will be useful to illustrate the situation with an example . consider the minimization of the functional @xmath236 on @xmath20 , where @xmath237 and @xmath238 means @xmath239 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath240 has been adjusted so that it is invariant under dilatations , whereas , @xmath241 is minimized by functions as narrow as possible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can proceed by classifying the space of functions by their value of @xmath241 , and choose the minimizer of @xmath240 in each class . a simple calculation , using lagrange multipliers , shows that the minimizer is a gaussian located anywhere and with arbitrary normalization and a well - defined width @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath242 and @xmath243 . </S>",
    "<S> next , in order to minimize @xmath241 , we should take @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the infimum of @xmath244 is then @xmath245 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute minimizer does not exist in @xmath20 , but a minimizing sequence must approach in some sense the sequence @xmath246 in the limit @xmath247 , modulo normalization and location . furthermore , the corresponding probability density @xmath248 must approach the distribution @xmath106 , again modulo translations .    after these considerations , we will state our conjecture on the form of the minimizer of @xmath87 in @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , it is that a minimizer must necessarily be a singular bi - gaussian in the space @xmath224 ( in the weak sense ) and modulo dilatations . to put this conjecture in precise terms , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath124 denote precisely the distribution in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:13 ] ) and let @xmath249 denote @xmath250 , where @xmath251 and @xmath252 .    </S>",
    "<S> * conjecture 3 . * _ let @xmath253 be a minimizing sequence for @xmath87 in @xmath95 ( in the sense of @xmath51 and the parameter @xmath40 taking positive values ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , ( a ) there is a sequence of positive numbers @xmath254 and a sequence of complex numbers @xmath255 such that @xmath256 converges weakly to @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> according to ( a ) , let us assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath253 has this property with @xmath257 and that it is normalized to unity , @xmath258 . </S>",
    "<S> then,(b ) there is a sequence of centered gaussian functions @xmath259 such that the sequence @xmath260 strongly approaches @xmath253 , that is , @xmath261 . </S>",
    "<S> _    it is clear that this conjecture is stronger than conjecture 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it states that conditions @xmath262 and @xmath263 are necessary for a minimizing sequence . on the other hand , assuming conjecture 2 , they are sufficient : first note that @xmath264 in @xmath96 guarantees @xmath265 in @xmath97 , and thus if @xmath266 is normalized to unity and @xmath267 has a finite non zero limit , @xmath268 . </S>",
    "<S> further , proposition 1 was proved assuming @xmath174 to be independent of @xmath40 . the danger with an @xmath40-dependent @xmath269 is that , if @xmath270 or @xmath271 do not go to 0 for small @xmath40 , the various terms in the series of @xmath110 or @xmath169 , respectively , overlap and the proposition does not apply . </S>",
    "<S> this danger is avoided by condition @xmath262 since @xmath272 is assumed to approach @xmath124 which consists of well separated dirac deltas .    in conclusion , we have presented a set of conjectures on the infimum and on the minimizers of the functionals @xmath22 and @xmath87 in the space of odd one - dimensional functions . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on information obtained through a simple - minded direct approach , namely , a numerical minimization . </S>",
    "<S> this can not be made into anything rigorous , since the numerical procedure might be lead to a relative minimum , rather than to the absolute one , however this possibility seems quite unlikely to us since the numerical result has been checked to be stable against details of the calculation , including changes in the initial conditions chosen for the minimization .    </S>",
    "<S> although at first sight the numerical result in figure  1 seems to be rather irregular , we have hopefully shown in this work that in fact it is plenty of structure and regularity . </S>",
    "<S> the space @xmath176 has proven to have nice properties directly inherited from the map @xmath273 into @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the infimum of @xmath22 in @xmath21 has been understood as an approximation to twice the absolute infimum in @xmath20 and the numerical minimizer has been understood as a ( singular ) double gaussian structure . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian functions seem to dominate the entropy minimization problem both in the whole space and in the odd functions subspace . </S>",
    "<S> likely , these regularities will open the way for a rigorous treatment of the problem studied here . </S>"
