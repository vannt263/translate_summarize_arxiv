    "the chiral symmetry has served as one of the important symmetries in classifying the disordered systems @xcite .",
    "for the two - dimensional massless dirac fermions as in graphene @xcite , it has been shown that the symmetry protects the zero - mode landau levels , which gives rise to a criticality of the quantum hall transition at the charge - neutrality point @xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry has then been extended to encompass more general cases , namely tilted dirac fermions such as observed in an organic compound @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 @xcite , where the robustness of the zero modes is retained for tilted massless as well as massive dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "so far , however , the generalization has only been considered for the dirac field in low - energy , effective hamiltonians , so that it remains unclear whether lattice fermions respecting the generalized chiral symmetry can be constructed or even exist . here ,",
    "we explore exactly this issue , and we shall show how such a generalized chiral symmetry can be extended to lattice fermions .",
    "this is not only conceptually interesting , but would also facilitate numerical analyses based on lattice models to clarify the effect of symmetry .",
    "a key idea here is an introduction of a  continuous deformation \" of hamiltonians having the generalized chiral symmetry .",
    "the deformation , which does not change the basic profile of the zero - energy state , can be applied not only to effective hamiltonians in the continuum limit , but also to lattice models .",
    "the deformation also turns out to be applicable to spatially non - uniform systems , so we shall discuss as a spin - off how the zero - energy solutions in the fermion - vortex system considered by jackiw and rossi @xcite are generalized for tilted dirac fermions .",

    "the conventional chiral symmetry is defined not only for effective hamiltonians , but also for lattice models with a bipartite structure .",
    "the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice for graphene is indeed typical , where the lattice can be divided into a and b sub - lattices with transfer integrals only between a and b. it is then straightforward to see that the chiral operator reads , on the lattice , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at atomic site @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the generalized chiral symmetry has so far been defined only for the low - energy , effective hamiltonian having tilted dirac cones .",
    "thus our goal is to explicitly construct or even generate systematically lattice models that have the rigorous generalized chiral symmetry .",
    "let us begin with the generalized chiral symmetry defined by the generalized chiral operator @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , which is not hermitian but satisfies @xmath16 @xcite . for general tilted dirac fermions described by the effective hamiltonian , @xmath17p_x +   [ -y_0 + ( \\bm{y}\\cdot \\bm{\\sigma})]p_y\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being three - dimensional real vectors , such @xmath14 exists as long as a condition , @xmath20 , is fullfilled with @xmath21 , which is equivalent to the ellipticity of the hamiltonian @xmath5 as a differential operator @xcite .",
    "an explicit expression for the generalized chiral operator @xmath14 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a unit vector parallel to @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the conventional chiral operator @xmath3 for the vertical dirac fermion ( @xmath26 ) is given by @xmath27",
    "note that the operator @xmath28 is not unitary but hermitian ( @xmath29 ) with @xmath30 real as long as @xmath31 .",
    "we shall use the algebraic expression ( [ gcop ] ) for the generalized chiral operator @xmath14 in terms of the conventional chiral operator @xmath3 to propose a systematic deformation of hamiltonians preserving the generalized chiral symmetry .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction in section 2 , we extend in section 3 our deformation to lattice fermions , where dirac fermions are always doubled . in section 4 .",
    "we analyze the consequences of our deformation in lattice models with the translational invariance .",
    "an application to the zero modes of the fermion - vortex system where the translational invariance is broken , is given in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary .",
    "before a full description of the general deformation for lattice fermions , let us first discuss , for illustrative purpose , a deformation for effective , single dirac fermions .",

    "one of the important properties of this deformation is that the wave function of zero modes are explicitly given in terms of those of the original hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "if we have a zero mode @xmath42 of the original @xmath33 satisfying @xmath43 , the corresponding zero - mode of the deformed hamiltonian is given by a simple transformation @xmath44 , since @xmath45 = t_{\\bm{\\tau}}^{-1}(q)h_0\\psi_0 = 0 $ ] .",
    "the zero modes are thus retained by this deformation .",
    "furthermore , if we recall that the zero modes of the original hamiltonian can be taken as the eigenstates of the chiral operator @xmath3 as @xmath46 , the transformed zero modes @xmath44 of the deformed hamiltonian become the exact eigenstates of the generalized chiral operator @xmath14 as @xmath47 .",
    "we can also note that the determinant of the hamiltonian is invariant in the deformation ( @xmath48 ) , which follows from @xmath49 .",
    "it is verified directly that the present deformation indeed produces tilted dirac fermions from vertical dirac fermions .",
    "namely , from @xmath50 for vertical dirac fermions , we obtain @xmath51 with @xmath52 this is nothing but the hamiltonian for the tilted dirac fermions except for the case @xmath53 .    here the vector @xmath36 , which defines the present deformation , can be chosen arbitrarily , and is in principle independent of the vector @xmath54 characterizing the conventional chiral operator , @xmath55 .",
    "however , we can emphasize that , even when the vector @xmath36 has a component parallel to @xmath56 , such a component does not contribute to the tilting of the dirac fermions , hence to the breaking of the conventional chiral symmetry .",
    "if we resolve @xmath36 into the components parallel @xmath57 and perpendicular @xmath58 to @xmath56 , we see that the parameters @xmath59 are indeed determined only by @xmath58 , since @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore focus ourselves on the deformation where @xmath36 is perpendicular to @xmath56 .",
    "now we show that the deformation can be extended to lattice models .",
    "generally , the hamiltonian of a lattice model that can be reduced to a form , @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 being @xmath66 hermitian matrices , has the chiral symmetry if there exits a real vector @xmath67 with @xmath68 satisfying the condition @xmath69 this can be verified with the chiral operator defined as @xmath70 that anti - commutes with the hamiltonian , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the @xmath74 identity matrix .    to be more specific ,",

    "we can readily see that the deformed lattice hamiltonian @xmath32 respects the generalized chiral symmetry , @xmath85 .",
    "it should be noted that this deformation can be performed for a wide variety of systems with or without the translational invariance , which cover disordered systems and fermion - vortex systems .    in this representation ,",

    "<S> while it has been pointed out that the chiral symmetry , which is important for the dirac fermions in graphene , can be generalized to tilted dirac fermions as in organic metals , such a generalized symmetry was so far defined only for a continuous low - energy hamiltonian . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the generalized chiral symmetry can be rigorously defined for lattice fermions as well . </S>",
    "<S> a key concept is a continuous  algebraic deformation \" of hamiltonians , which generates lattice models with the generalized chiral symmetry from those with the conventional chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to explicitly express zero modes of the deformed hamiltonian in terms of that of the original hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> another virtue is that the deformation can be extended to non - uniform systems , such as fermion - vortex systems and disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> application to fermion vortices in a deformed system shows how the zero modes for the conventional dirac fermions with vortices can be extended to the tilted case . </S>"
