    "one would not be able to see a pot of boiling water with a surface dividing the liquid from the vapor .",
    "this is only possible when the system is confined to a given specific energy @xmath16 i.e. in the micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "the energy controls what portion of the water is liquid and what is steam .",
    "every - day macroscopic experience is represented by the micro - canonical ensemble because the energy supply is seldomly unrestricted .",
    "micro - canonical thermodynamics explores the topology of the n - body phase space and determines how its volume @xmath17 depends on the fundamental globally conserved quantities namely the total energy @xmath18 , the angular momentum @xmath19 , the mass ( number of atoms @xmath20 ) , charge @xmath21 , the linear momentum @xmath22 , and last not least the available spatial volume @xmath23 of the system .",

    "it is an entirely _ mechanistic _ definition .",
    "if we do not know more about a complicated interacting n - body system but the values of its globally conserved macroscopic parameters the probability to find it in a special phase space point ( n - body quantum state ) is uniform in the accessible phase space .",
    "it is of course a completely separated and difficult question , outside of thermodynamics , if and how a complicated interacting many - body system may explore its entire accessible phase space .",
    "this question does not concern us here .",
    "the present work is an attempt to develop the thermodynamics of realistic systems entirely from their mechanics without invoking any additional assumption like the use of the thermodynamic limit .",

    "e.g. in a fusion of two nuclei one obtains the excitation energy in each event from the ground - state q - values plus the incoming kinetic energy whereas the temperature of the fused compound nucleus is determined by measuring the kinetic energy spectrum of decay products which is an average over many decays .",
    "it is immediately clear that the size of @xmath32 is a measure of the _ fluctuations _ of the system .    in what follows",

    "we will avoid the concept of the thermodynamic limit as we believe that this is not really essential for the understanding of phase transitions .",
    "we will see that details about the transitions become more transparent in finite systems .",
    "then however , one needs a modified definition for the concept of phase transitions .    in the first paper of this series on micro - canonical thermodynamics and fragmentation of atomic clusters",
    "( papers i  iii , @xcite ) we introduced a new criterion of phase transitions , which avoids any reference to the thermodynamic limit and can also be used for finite systems : the anomaly of the micro - canonical caloric equation of state @xmath33 or the specific entropy @xmath34 per atom . in many cases",

    "very early the anomaly of the caloric curve @xmath33 was interpreted as signal for a phase transition in small systems in the statistical theory of multi - fragmentation of hot nuclei by gross and collaborators see refs . @xcite and the review article @xcite .",
    "challa and hetherington came to the same conclusion at about the same time in their paper on the gaussian ensemble @xcite . within the gaussian ensemble one can transform smoothly from the micro - canonical to the canonical ensemble .",
    "they concluded that there is a hierarchy of ensembles : micro - canonical @xmath37 canonical @xmath37 grand - canonical in which the content of information about the system diminishes from left to right .",
    "they claim it is impossible to recover the fundamental micro - canonical ensemble from the canonical .",
    "i.e. if the canonical partition sum is only known with limited accuracy , may be due to some approximation , then the back - transform is dangerously inaccurate .",
    "this is a fortiori the case at the most interesting points : at phase transitions of first order , see below .",
    "of course , this is because of the high sensitivity of the laplace ",
    "back transform from the canonical to the micro - canonical partition sum .",
    "( e.g. as discussed below , the laplace transform e@xmath37 t suppresses configurations with liquid ",
    "gas phase separation by the exponentially small factor exp@xmath38 .",
    "the laplace - back transform must consequently enhance these configurations again by the inverse of this factor . ) for the case of the nuclear level - density formula by bethe this was demonstrated by ref.@xcite .",
    "bixton and jortner @xcite linked the back - bending of the micro - canonical caloric curve to strong bunching in the quantum level structure of the many - body system i.e. a sudden opening of new phase space when the energy rises .",
    "their paper offers an interesting analytical investigation of this feature .",
    "a phase transition of first order is characterised by a sine - like oscillation , a `` back - bending '' of @xmath39 c.f .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] . as shown below , the maxwell - line which divides the oscillation of @xmath40 into two opposite areas of equal size gives the inverse of the transition temperature @xmath3 , its length the specific latent heat @xmath4 , and the shaded area under each of the oscillations is the loss of specific entropy @xmath5 .",
    "the latter is connected to the creation of macroscopic intra - phase surfaces , which divide mixed configurations into separated pieces of different phases , e.g. liquid droplets in the gas or gas bubbles in the liquid .",
    "even nested situations are found in some other cases like liquid droplets inside of crystallised pieces which themselves are swimming in the liquid in the case of the solid  liquid transition , see e.g. the experiments reported in @xcite .",
    "i.e. at phase transitions of first order inhomogeneous `` macroscopic or collective '' density fluctuations are common , boiling water is certainly the best known example .",
    "phase - dividing surfaces of macroscopic size exist where many atoms collectively constitute a boundary between two phases which cause the reduction of entropy by @xmath5 . as the entropy is the integral of @xmath41 : @xmath42 it is a concave function of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) as long as @xmath45 shows the usual monotonic rise with energy . in the pathological back - bending region of @xmath41",
    "the entropy @xmath46 has a convex intruder of depth @xmath5 @xcite(c.f .",
    "fig.[fig1]c ) . this has the consequence that the specific heat @xmath47 becomes _",
    "negative_. this astonishing result was discussed early by thirring @xcite . at the beginning ( @xmath48 ) of the intruder the specific entropy @xmath46",
    "is reduced compared to its concave hull , which is the tangent to @xmath46 in the points @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the derivative of the hull to @xmath41 follows the maxwell - line in the interval @xmath51 . in the middle , ( @xmath52 ) , when the separation of the phases is fully established this reduction is maximal @xmath53 and at the end of the transition ( @xmath50 ) when the intra - phase surface disappears @xmath5 is gained back .",
    "consequently , the two equal areas in @xmath41 are the initial loss of surface entropy @xmath5 and the later regain of it . due to van hove s theorem @xcite",
    "this convex intruder of @xmath46 must disappear for `` thermodynamically stable systems '' as we consider in this paper in the thermodynamic limit which it will do if @xmath54 .",
    "this is why a transition of first order may easier be identified in finite systems where the intruder can still be seen .",
    "the intra - phase surface tension is related to @xmath5 by @xmath55 .    in conventional thermodynamics",
    "a phase transition of first order is indicated by a singularity ( jump ) in the specific heat @xmath56 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath57 ) .",

    "@xmath46 has a positive curvature and the saddle point is a minimum in the direction of integration not a maximum .",
    "consequently , the laplace transform ( [ laplacest ] ) towards the canonical partition function @xmath72 jumps over this region which becomes exponentially suppressed by a factor @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the positive surface free energy . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath75 ) the integration follows the concave hull of @xmath46 here .",
    "then @xmath64 gets the singularity @xmath76 but otherwise remains finite @xcite , which is just the conventional signal of a phase transition of first order , c.f .",
    "ruelle @xcite .",
    "this jump over the energies ( @xmath51 ) of configurations with phase - separation with the consequence of their exponential suppression is the mathematical reason for the loss of information in the canonical ensemble .",
    "it is just the crucial information about the phase transition .",
    "our approach to phase - transitions of first order is complementary to the conventional approaches where the separation of the system into two homogeneous phases by a  in general  geometrical interface is investigated , e.g.@xcite .",
    "the problems due to the large fluctuations of this interface are numerous and severe , see e.g. the discussion on fluid interfaces by evans @xcite .",
    "these fluctuation are of course crucial for the interfacial entropy and consequently for the surface tension also .",
    "the two main differences of our approach are that    * we do not start with the _ geometry _ ( planar or spherical ) of the interface but focus our attention to the _ entropy _ of the phase separation .",
    "this turns out to be much simpler than the geometric approach .",
    "moreover , it is the entropy of the interface that decides the transition not its geometrical interpretation .",

    "this characterisation of phase transitions is purely thermodynamically .",
    "we have not yet defined what a phase is .",
    "much effort is spent in ruelle s book to define pure phases as those configurations for which in the thermodynamic limit observables survive increasing coarse - graining , for which space - averaged quantities do not fluctuate , c.f .",
    "chapter 6.5 in ruelle s book @xcite .",
    "of course , this definition works in the thermodynamic limit only .",
    "it does not address to finite systems . for a finite system",
    "it is not possible to decide if a specific configuration corresponds to a pure phase or not .",
    "the situation is analogous to the definition of the temperature , see above . again to be a pure phase is a feature of the whole ensemble not of a single phase - space point ( configuration ) .",
    "we use a _ statistical _ definition of a pure phase : a configuration belongs to the ensemble of pure phases  including its fluctuations  at concave points of @xmath81 with @xmath82 . at the two crossing points of the micro - canonical caloric curve @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath84 we say the system is in the pure `` liquid '' phase or in the pure `` gas '' phase respectively .",
    "this is at this moment nothing more than a working hypothesis .",
    "however , we will see that for the systems we have investigated ( 2-dim potts models , fragmentation of sodium , potassium , and iron clusters with @xmath85 atoms ) these definitions give very realistic values for _ all _ parameters of the transitions quite similar to the ones in the bulk . of course , the parameters depend weakly on the number of particles considered",
    ". however , there is no reason to emphasise any _ qualitative _ difference between the bulk transition and the `` phase transition '' with or without quotation marks in finite systems as defined above .",
    "it is evident , at a phase transition of first order ( @xmath70 ) the members of a canonical ensemble split into two distinct groups with different energy / particle ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) but with equal probability @xmath86 , a `` liquid '' and a `` vapour '' phase because both have the same free energy .",

    "of our series ) we will follow the micro - canonical fragmentation transition in clusters of sodium , potassium , and iron with increasing number of atoms towards the well known liquid - gas transition of the bulk .",
    "in contrast to the fragmentation transition in isolated clusters which have to be treated at an approximately constant volume defined by the short range of dissipation @xcite , the liquid - gas transition must be studied at constant pressure , here at 1 atmosphere .",

    "the advantage of our new signal of a phase transition is the following : as shown in @xcite the micro - canonical caloric equation of state @xmath33 gives this signal of a phase transition already for relatively small systems .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 becomes rather quickly independent of the number of particles outside the back - bending region , which itself degenerates for large @xmath20 towards the maxwell - line @xmath70 .",

    "the dramatic fluctuations of the physical interfaces between both phases at @xmath70 which can be seen e.g. in boiling water are a clear warning of the much more complicated and strongly fluctuating microscopic topology of the interfaces .",
    "they are considerably more complicated than the geometry assumed in the gibbs - ensemble method .",
    "the surface tension is proportional to the entropy of the interface - fluctuations and consequently it depends essentially on these fluctuations .",
    "microscopic canonical calculations of the surface tension have been done for lennard  jones systems . a detailed survey is given by salomons and mareschal @xcite .",
    "they discuss the following alternatives to determine the surface tension :    1 .   from the virial expansion of the free - energy as function of volume conserving distortions of the interface : @xmath256 where @xmath257 are the interatomic coordinates of the atoms ,",
    "@xmath258 is the surface area and @xmath259 is the derivative of the interatomic _ two - body _ potential , 2 .   from histograms of the free - energy as function of potential energy changes due to volume conserving deformations .",

    "evidently , the virial expansion works only for systems with two - body forces .",
    "so we can not use it for metallic systems .",
    "the second method has not been tried either .",
    "several simplifications were made :    * we use classical not quantum statistics .",
    " we do not believe that the problems we discussed in the present paper depend essentially on that difference . *",
    "the fragments were assumed to be spherical .",
    " this simplification means that surface degrees of freedom of the fragments are treated like bulk excitations .",
    "the size of the fragments was assumed to be independent of the excitation energy at @xmath265 .",
    "moreover , the static deformation of dimers and trimers is quite important for decay thresholds .",
    "an improvement of these approximations was not possible in the present calculation .",
    "* only internal excitations of the fragments of @xmath266 were allowed .",
    " this approximation may be justified for the decay of hot finite clusters @xcite where we argued that only a transient equilibrium of the decaying cluster over a time @xmath267 is achieved and states which live considerably shorter should not contribute as independent decay channels .",
    "this argument does not work in the present scenario .",
    "however , we believe that highly unbound states above the boiling excitation @xmath130 in small fragments are anyway better described by assuming an independent motion of the decay products , just as we do it here . doubling the actual value of @xmath268 had in most cases only little influence on the transition parameters obtained . *",
    "the calculation of the total intra - phase surface _ area _",
    "is problematic .",
    "consequently , the determination of the surface tension per surface area @xmath7 suffers under a great uncertainty , whereas the determination of the surface _",
    "@xmath5 is easy .",
    "the situation is complementary to the gibbs ensemble method @xcite .",
    "however , the surface entropy is crucial for the occurrence and classification of a phase transition , not its geometrical interpretation . *",
    "the input values of the liquid drop parameters of the ground - state binding energies of the fragments given by @xcite suffer from the uncertainty of the temperature of the clusters where the experimental data were taken .",
    "the bulk measurements of the surface tension suffers from many effects c.f.@xcite : * * the surface tension of alkali clusters might be reduced by oxygen contamination . *",
    "* the volume expansion coefficient @xmath269 is only known within @xmath270 . *",
    "* @xmath271 refers to the solid phase which is most likely anisotropic and can not easily be extrapolated from the melting point .",
    "the liquid  gas transition in metals at normal pressure of 1 atm .",
    "is experimentally well explored .",
    "therefore , it is a good test case for our new ideas and computational methods of micro - canonical thermodynamics . by allowing a system of @xmath85 atoms to condense or fragment into an arbitrary number of spherical fragment clusters which are internally excited to energies of @xmath272 per atom and into an arbitrary number of free atoms under a fixed given external pressure of 1 atmosphere we directly calculated the micro - canonical caloric curve @xmath273 ( c.f . the detailed formula eq.([betap ] ) ) by micro - canonical monte carlo methods ( _ mmmc_)@xcite .",

    "this result is remarkable for several reasons :    1 .",
    "it proves that a phase transition of first order in a realistic continuous system can very well be seen and classified in small mesoscopic clusters _ without invoking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "_ in fact , with the non - vanishing back - bending of @xmath278 the transition is easier recognisable than in the thermodynamic limit . for the 10-states potts model",
    "we know that the micro - canonical parameters depend less on the size of the system than the canonical ones @xcite .",
    "finite size scaling for the micro - canonical transition parameters are not known in general .",
    "however , here we want to stress that there is no reason at all not to discuss phase transitions in small systems .",
    "2 .   even though the values determined for the specific surface tension @xmath279",
    "are somewhat uncertain because of the difficulty to fix and determine the surface _ area _ , the surface _",
    "@xmath280 which is the relevant quantity that determines the nature of the transition can very well be calculated .",
    "3 .   even for a realistic metallic system with its long - range many - body interactions",
    "the _ m_icrocanoncal _ m_etropolis _ m_onte _",
    "c_arlo simulation method ( _ mmmc _ ) is able to describe the liquid ",
    "gas phase transitions quite well .",
    "this is possible because we do not use molecular dynamics with a two - body hamiltonian but use the experimental ground - state binding energies of the fragment clusters which of course take care of the metallic bonding of their constituents .",
    "the intra - phase surface entropy can be microscopically calculated .",
    "( essentially we calculated the temperature dependent part of it .",
    "the value at @xmath159 is an input parameter of our calculation . )",
    "the surface tension per surface area can be determined if the intra - phase _ area _ is known . for the surface",
    "entropy the fluctuation and fragmentation of the surfaces are essential . at the liquid ",
    "gas transition of sodium and potassium clusters of sizes as considered here at normal pressure the intra - phase fluctuations are mainly due to strong inhomogeneities and clusterization and not due to homogeneous stretching .",
    "this is consistent with recent experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "5 .   micro - canonical thermodynamics gives an important insight into the details of the transition which are hidden in the canonical approach .",
    "the transition in sodium is a good example : figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig1a ] show how the transition is a combination of actually two transitions , one from evaporation of very light fragments out of a large residue into a multi - fragmentation of the system into many larger pieces , and second the complete decay into a gas of monomers .",
    "the success of the _",
    "m_etropolis _ m_onte _",
    "c_arlo sampling method to reproduce the known infinite matter values of the liquid ",
    "gas transition is also a promising and necessary test of _ mmmc _ to describe nuclear fragmentation correctly @xcite and to be able to get insight into the ( eventually critical ) behaviour of the nuclear matter liquid  gas transition .",
    "this is important as an experimental test of the predictions of the model for nuclear matter is not available .",
    "7 .   the division of the macroscopic time - independent observables of the n - body system into 1 .",
    "observables which can be determined at each phase - space _ point _ , in each individual realisation of the micro - canonical ensemble : the globally conserved quantities like the energy , the number of particles , the charge , the momentum , the angular momentum , and 2 .   into the thermodynamic observables which refer to the size of the ensemble , the _ volume _ @xmath27 of the energy shell of the n - body phase space , and which can not be determined at a single phase - space point , in a single event , like the entropy , the temperature , the pressure , the chemical potential + is very essential . also the concept of a pure phase and of a phase - transition belongs to the second group . 8 .",
    "last not least , there is a very fundamental difference between micro - canonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "this can not be emphasised enough : as said above , if one wants to study a configuration where two - phases coexist simultaneously and are separated by an interface one has to control energy ( if pressure is fixed ) .",
    "thus the _ the micro ensemble \\{e , p , n } is the adequate ensemble at phase transitions of first order in the bulk , not the canonical _ , at least if the energy resources are not unlimited as they usually are .",
