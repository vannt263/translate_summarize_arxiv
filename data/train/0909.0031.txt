    "high - redshift galaxy studies rely in large part on samples selected using color techniques or extreme emission - line properties .",
    "however , it is very difficult to know how such galaxy populations relate to one another or how they fit into the overall scheme of galaxy evolution . adding complexity to the problem is the fact that active galactic nucleus ( agn ) contributions to the light of different galaxy populations may cause different selection biases , often in ways that are hard to determine and quantify . for example , cowie et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that at low redshifts the agn contribution dominates the light at wavelengths below the lyman continuum edge .",
    "a classic example of a highly valued population whose relationship to other samples is unclear is the ly@xmath0 emitter ( lae ) population , which features prominently in the very highest redshift galaxy studies ( e.g. , hu & cowie 2006 and references therein ) . current estimates of the fraction of galaxies that exhibit lae properties are mostly based on comparisons of the lae and lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) populations at @xmath6 ( shapley et al .  2003 ) .",
    "however , it would be useful to know how that fraction varies with redshift , as well as whether the presence of a strong ly@xmath0 emission line might be related to other galaxy properties .    of course , the observed properties of a galaxy are not enough , as one also needs to know how best to translate those properties into interesting physical quantities , such as star formation rates , masses , and metallicities .",
    "because ly@xmath0 is resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , such translations are particularly difficult to do for laes .",
    "determining the escape path of ly@xmath0 and hence its dust destruction is an extremely complex problem both theoretically ( e.g. , neufeld 1991 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2007 ) and observationally ( e.g. , kunth et al .  2003",
    "; schaerer & verhamme 2008 ) . in particular",
    ", we do not have a very clear understanding of how to translate ly@xmath0 luminosities into star formation rates in individual galaxies .",
    "fortunately , new possibilities for making significant advances in placing the laes in context have become available through _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex _ ; martin et al .",
    "2005 ) grism spectroscopy . in a seminal paper deharveng et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that low - redshift ( @xmath7 ) galaxies with strong ly@xmath0 emission lines can be selected from these data .",
    "the selection process is based on finding ly@xmath0 in the uv - continuum selected _ galex _ sources and thus is most analagous to locating ly@xmath0 emitters in the high - redshift lbg population via spectroscopy ( shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , the procedure enables the selection of a substantial sample of sources that can be compared to the high - redshift laes .",
    "these low - redshift galaxy samples have many advantages .",
    "for one thing , the galaxies are bright and can be easily studied at other wavelengths .",
    "perhaps even more importantly , however , these low - redshift galaxy samples can be integrated into comprehensive studies of the galaxy populations at these redshifts to understand some of the selection biases .",
    "for example , we can determine the fraction of nuv - continuum selected galaxies in this redshift interval that have strong ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "moreover , by comparing the ly@xmath0 properties of the low - redshift galaxies with their optical properties , including their h@xmath0 line strengths , we can calibrate the conversion of ly@xmath0 luminosity to star formation rate and answer many of the questions on how laes are drawn from the more general nuv - continuum selected population .",
    "finally , we can see whether the presence of strong ly@xmath0 emission in a galaxy is related to the galaxy s metallicity , extinction , morphology , or kinematics .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ secgalex ]",
    "we use the _ galex _ extracted spectra ( morrissey et al .",
    "2007 ) on nine high galactic latitude fields with deep _ galex _",
    "grism exposures to generate a catalog of 261 ly@xmath0 emission - line sources in the redshift intervals @xmath1 ( low redshift ) and @xmath2 ( moderate redshift ) .",
    "this sample extends to an nuv ( ab ) magnitude of 21.8 .",
    "we divide the ly@xmath0 sources into two classes : obvious agns , due to the presence of high - excitation lines in their uv spectra , and galaxies , which do not have such lines .",
    "it should be emphasized that some of the objects in the  galaxy \" class may in fact be agns , where either the high - excitation lines are weak in the uv or where they lie in missing portions of the uv spectrum .    in section  [ secopt ]",
    "we present optical spectroscopy of a subsample of the sources with",
    "uv spectra .",
    "these observations were obtained using multi - object masks with the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et al .",

    "in section  [ secagngal ] we use the optical data and a comparison with x - ray observations to show that our agn and galaxy classifications from the uv spectra are broadly robust .",
    "we also analyze to what extent the _ galex _ line widths may be used to discriminate further between star - forming galaxies and agns .    in section  [ lalpha ]",
    "we present the _ galex _ lae sample defined in the same way as high - redshift lae samples , and we measure the lae number counts and luminosity functions .",
    "we compare these with the number counts and luminosity functions constructed for both nuv - continuum selected samples and high - redshift lae samples .",
    "we also consider the equivalent width distributions and kinematics of the _ galex _ lae sample .    in section  [ lae_lbg ]",
    "we study the properties of low - redshift ly@xmath0 galaxies using the ly@xmath0 and nuv - continuum selected sources that we optically confirmed as galaxies , as well as an essentially spectroscopically complete sample of nuv  @xmath8 galaxies in the great observatories origins deep survey - north ( goods - n ; giavalisco et al .",

    "[ ew_dist ] , title=\"fig:\",width=355 ]    we next measured a redshift for each source with an emission line and split the sources into one of two classes : an agn class if there were high - excitation lines ( usually ovi or civ ) present in addition to the ly@xmath0 line , or a galaxy class to denote a potential star - forming galaxy if there were only a single line visible . in the latter case we assumed the line was ly@xmath0 in determining the redshift , an assumption we will test and find to be extremely reliable using optical spectra .",
    "we will frequently refer to the sources in our galaxy class as our candidate ly@xmath0 galaxies , using the word `` candidate '' to emphasize that some of these will turn out to be agns .",
    "the relative classifications are illustrated in figure  [ sample_spectra ] , where we show examples of ( a ) a broad - line agn , ( b ) a narrower line agn , and ( c ) a candidate ly@xmath0 galaxy .",
    "for each source we fitted a 140    rest - frame region around the ly@xmath0 line with a gaussian and a flat continuum to determine four parameters : the ly@xmath0 line width ( this includes the rather wide instrumental resolution ) , the observed - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the line , the central wavelength , and the continuum level .",
    "we used the idl mpfit procedures of markwardt ( 2008 ) , which are based on the more ( 1978 ) implementation of the levenberg - marquardt algorithm and are very robust .",
    "we used the _",
    "galex _ noise vector to determine the input error for the spectrum and determined the statistical errors from the covariance matrix returned by the program .",
    "all of the sources have detectable continuum at the ly@xmath0 position .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the nuv magnitude selection in the _ galex _ spectral extraction for the nuv selected ly@xmath0 lines , and of the nuv magnitude selection and the small difference between the fuv and nuv magnitudes for the fuv selected ly@xmath0 lines at lower redshifts .",
    "however , changes in the fitting procedure ( such as choosing a different wavelength range or fitting the baseline with a linear fit rather than a constant ) can change the fitted parameters . in general these changes correspond to errors in the ew of less than 20% , and , for the most part , the errors are smaller than 10% , which are comparable to the statistical errors . however , in a very small number of cases ( less than a few percent ) more substantial errors can occur as the fitting procedure finds a substantially different solution .",
    "visual inspection suggests that the present choice of parameters provides the most reasonable results .",
    "the final ly@xmath0 selected samples are summarized in tables  [ tab2]@xmath24[tab10 ] for each of the nine fields individually . for each source",

    "the candidate ly@xmath0 galaxy population begins to enter in substantial numbers around a nuv magnitude of 21 .",
    "figure  [ redshift - dist](b ) suggests immediately that we are misclassifying some sources as candidate ly@xmath0 galaxies when they are in fact agns , since we would expect @xmath34 galaxies to be very faint or undetected in the fuv band , which lies below the lyman continuum edge at these redshifts ( e.g. , siana et al .  2007 ; cowie et al .",
    "quantifying this contamination is one of the keys to understanding the star - forming population .",
    "we will address this issue in section  [ secagngal ] .",
    "we will require the observed area as a function of nuv magnitude when we calculate the number counts and luminosity functions of the laes .",
    "we determined this for each field separately by computing the ratio of sources with _",
    "galex _ spectra ( identified or not ) at a given nuv magnitude to sources with that nuv magnitude in the continuum catalog .",
    "we then multiplied this ratio for each field by the area corresponding to the @xmath15 selection radius and summed the results for the nine fields to form the area - magnitude relation shown in figure  [ redshift - dist](c ) . at magnitudes brighter than nuv",
    "@xmath33 the area is the 8.2  deg@xmath35 area of the nine fields .",
    "the area then drops as we reach the limiting magnitudes of each of the individual fields , eventually falling to zero at @xmath36 , which is the limiting depth of the deepest ( groth  00 ) field .",
    "given the low spatial resolution of the _ galex _ data , some sources may be blends .",
    "while this does not affect the ly@xmath0 fluxes or luminosities , it will diminish the ews if the measured continuum is too high relative to the line due to a blend .",
    "it will also boost the nuv magnitudes so that we are including sources which are fainter than the nominal limits .",
    "we first re - measured the _ galex _ coordinates by visually determining the peak position in the nuv image closest to the cataloged position in the data archive .",

    "the dispersion of the re - measured positions relative to the catalog positions is @xmath37 .",
    "however , a small number of sources have more significant offsets : about 6% have offsets greater than @xmath38 and 2% greater than @xmath39 . in tables  [ tab2 ] through [ tab10 ] we show our re - measured coordinates , marking those which have a significant offset from the cataloged position in the data archive with the label ( o ) in the name column .",
    "we next tested for the fraction of blends by comparing the nuv images with the ultradeep @xmath40-band images obtained on the groth  00 and cosmos  00 fields as part of the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) legacy survey deep observations .",
    "these are available from the megapipe database at the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) .",
    "we corrected for the small absolute astrometric offsets between the cfht and _ galex _ coordinates prior to the comparison .",
    "we find that about 5% are significant enough blends to seriously affect the photometry and coordinates .",
    "we mark these in tables  [ tab2 ] and [ tab5 ] with a ( b ) in the name column .",
    "the blending problem is small enough to be neglected in the analysis , but the small number of objects with significant positional offsets should be borne in mind when using the _ galex _ coordinates in the data archive .",
    "while a number of sources in our _ galex _ agn and candidate ly@xmath0 galaxy samples have pre - existing optical redshifts , these identifications are generally selected in some way , often from optical colors or because of the presence of x - ray emission or other agn signatures . however , in order to understand the statistical distribution of the optical properties of the sources in these samples , it is critical to observe at optical wavelengths sources randomly chosen from these samples .",
    "in addition , in order to understand how the _ galex _ ly@xmath0 selected sources relate to the more general population of nuv - continuum selected sources , it is important to observe at optical wavelengths sources randomly chosen from the _ galex _ spectroscopic sample without uv spectral identifications ( i.e. , without strong ly@xmath0 emission ) .",

    "in this regard the problems of distinguishing agns from emission - line galaxies using baldwin et al .

    "however , in practice , the present sample is too small to allow such a procedure .",
    "an alternative procedure , following deharveng et al .",

    "specifically , for each field we determined a ly@xmath0 flux limit corresponding to a source with the limiting nuv magnitude of table  [ tab1 ] corrected to an fuv magnitude by adding an offset of 0.37  mag ( see figure  [ galaxy_color ] ) and with an observed ew(ly@xmath0 ) corresponding to the chosen rest - frame limit placed at the center of the redshift interval . for a rest - frame ew(ly@xmath0 ) of 45   ,",

    "thus , the narrow range of observed values in figure  [ lumra - ha ] is merely a selection bias , as we illustrate by putting upper bounds on the optically - confirmed nuv - continuum selected galaxies ( blue diamonds ) .",

    "the reason for the selection bias is as follows .",
    "a given uv continuum luminosity corresponds to an approximate h@xmath0 luminosity in the absence of continuum extinction , and for a given ew(ly@xmath0 ) , it also specifies the ly@xmath0 luminosity . for this sample we can use the empirical star formation rate calibrations given in cowie & barger ( 2008 ) , @xmath132 and the conversion from fuv fluxes to nuv fluxes based on figure  [ galaxy_color ] ( nuv = fuv@xmath133  mag ) to roughly obtain a relation between the nuv continuum luminosity and the h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "then we use the nuv continuum flux and the ew(ly@xmath0 ) to determine the ly@xmath0 luminosity and obtain the relation @xmath134 where ew(ly@xmath0 ) is the rest - frame ew(ly@xmath0 ) .",

    "the exact lower bound does depend on the details of the star formation history , which determines the exact uv continuum to h@xmath0 conversion , and on the extinction , which can lower the @xmath135(ly@xmath136(h@xmath0 ) ratios .",
    "however , the lower limit bias will still be present .",

    "we can then estimate the fraction of ly@xmath0 photons that escape from nuv - continuum selected galaxies at a particular redshift using the ratio of the total ly@xmath0 light to the total h@xmath0 light and combine this with the measured values in the objects with identified ly@xmath0 to form an average appropriate for the total galaxy sample in the redshift range .    to do this , we constructed average rest - frame galaxy spectra .",
