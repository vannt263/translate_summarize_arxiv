    "relativistic hydrodynamics is a very useful tool in the field of heavy ion collisions when one wants to reproduce the space - time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in such events . upon the hypothesis of local equilibrium , which can be questionable for such small and not long - lived systems",
    ", this approach directly gives in terms of usual quantities such as temperature , pressure ... , an intuitive description of what happens during the whole evolution of the system until the freeze - out takes place .",
    "moreover , it is usually assumed that the matter under consideration is almost perfect , so that standard hydrodynamics can be applied directly .",
    "however , the hot and dense matter produced is mainly constituted of pions and , with the exception of @xcite , no attention has been drawn to the fact that the breaking of chiral symmetry can affect the theory of hydrodynamics itself .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is thus to give in a simple approach a quantitative estimate of this modification .",
    "more precisely , we will determine the temperature profile with respect to time in the framework of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional boost - invariant bjorken model with and without the effect of the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry .",
    "in a second step we also introduce the dissipation process and compare the previous results with those obtained when mller - israel - stewart second order theory of dissipation is included on top of standard hydrodynamics .",
    "following @xcite , the hydrodynamics degrees of freedom in a chiral fluid with chiral @xmath0 symmetry spontaneously broken are the densities associated to conserved quantities , namely entropy density @xmath1 , momentum density @xmath2 , baryonic number density @xmath3 , left and right - handed charge densities which can be written as @xmath0-matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 and finally the variables associated to the goldstone modes introduced in the theory _ via _ a @xmath0-matrix @xmath6 . if we focus on the central rapidity region of a heavy ion collision , we can neglect in a first step the baryonic density .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamic equations taken from @xcite become :    @xmath7    @xmath8    where the energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 .    in the above equations , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , which can be interpreted as the temporal ( spatial ) pion decay constant , are actually not constants but have a non - trivial temperature dependence .",
    "nevertheless , in order to have an estimation of the effects induced by the presence of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , we will adopt two simple approaches .",
    "the first one , for the sake of simplicity , is to consider that @xmath13 mev .",
    "of course , at finite temperature , this is not true and , for instance , for small temperatures , one knows that @xmath14 and @xmath15 differ from @xmath16 by a factor proportional to @xmath17 while the correction for @xmath18 is of order @xmath19 so that , to first order , @xmath20 .",
    "this second approach , more realistic , is based on this formula , extended to larger temperatures .",
    "even if several important improvements concerning the geometric description of a heavy ion collision have been done since the pioneering paper of bjorken @xcite , we will use here this simplified version .",
    "the bjorken picture of a collision is based on the hypothesis that initial conditions are invariant under lorentz transformations throughout the central rapidity plateau .",
    "this implies that , for a one - dimensional flow in the @xmath21-direction , all the quantities depend actually not on the time @xmath22 and the position @xmath21 but only on the proper time @xmath23 .",
    "the space - time evolution of the system can be then represented by hyperbola @xmath24 .",
    "if the hydrodynamic velocity @xmath25 is taken as @xmath26 , the hydrodynamic equations @xmath27 with @xmath28 lead for an ultra relativistic gas to the following differential equations @xcite : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 whose solutions give the following scaling behavior : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 and , since @xmath35 : @xmath36",
    "we first take into account the effect of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry where no renormalization of the pion decay constant occurs , i.e. @xmath13 mev .",
    "we thus obtain from the hydrodynamic equations ( [ tmunu]),([sigma ] ) in the first non - vanishing order of the pion field  : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath37 @xmath38 and from the explicit expression of the pressure @xmath39 given in @xcite : @xmath40 we see that there is no modification of the equation for the entropy density and for the temperature , that is the scaling behavior is exactly the same @xmath41 and @xmath42 . on the contrary , for the energy density and for the pressure , one can observe a modification due to a term proportional to @xmath43 which can be determined from the last equation ( [ pifts ] ) . the solution for the time derivative is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant whose value is fixed by initial condition for @xmath46 .",
    "if we now report in the above equations , we can solve analytically the resulting system to obtain : @xmath47 @xmath48    in order to fix the initial condition related to the value of @xmath45 , let us now consider the density matrix @xmath49 .",
    "the part of the hamiltonian relevant for chiral hydrodynamics degrees of freedom can be taken from @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation with bjorken modelisation of the collision gives : @xmath50 assuming isospin symmetry , we then have : @xmath51 . for @xmath46",
    ", we thus immediately see that @xmath52 is gauss distributed .",
    "actually , if we call @xmath53 the initial volume in the rest - frame of the two colliding nuclei and @xmath54 the lorentz factor needed to go from that frame to the laboratory frame , we have : @xmath55 we can easily estimate @xmath53 by geometric arguments : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the radius of the colliding nuclei .",
    "if we now put typical numbers on all these constants : @xmath58 fm , @xmath59 fm , @xmath60 and @xmath61 mev , we can directly estimate the effect of the terms associated to the spontaneous symmetry breaking since @xmath62 is simply related to the gaussian distribution : @xmath63 . numerically , using these inputs , we obtain a correction of order @xmath641% with respect to the perfect case .",
    "we now introduce the explicit chiral perturbation @xmath65-dependence for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath20 . the evolution of the temperature is then governed by the following equation  : @xmath66 where now @xmath67 .",
    "the numerical results are presented on figure [ graphbreak ] .",
    "we can observe that the correction , which induce a faster cooling of the system is of order 5% .",
    "even if the approach can be considered too simplistic , it is not reasonably expected that an improved treatment can modify noticeably the order of magnitude .",
    "one can thus conclude that the effect due the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is quite negligible and without any experimental consequences .",
    "in the previous part we have seen that it is possible to neglect the effect of the breaking of the symmetry on the hydrodynamics theory itself , that is we can use `` normal '' hydrodynamics .",
    "nevertheless an important question which has already been addressed in @xcite is the effect of dissipation on top of this model of perfect fluid .",
    "there are two non equivalent possibilities to take into account dissipation .",
    "first , one can use the usual formalism and just say that when an inhomogeneity appears in a system , the latter reacts and a flow proportional to the gradient develops itself in order to restore equilibrium .",
    "this is first order theory .",
    "however it is well - known that this approach presents instabilities and that it is necessary to consider a relaxation time for the flow .",
    "this goal is achieved through mller - israel - stewart second order theory . in the following",
    "we will explore both methods .    in @xcite",
    ", the author showed that only the dissipative effects related to the shear viscosity @xmath68 play a role for the temperature profile in the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional bjorken model .",
    "the main physical reason is that bulk viscosity vanishes for an ultra relativistic gas .",
    "he took the shear viscosity from @xcite where the temperature dependence for @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "then , the differential equations to be solved for the energy density @xmath70 are : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is related to the stress tensor ( see @xcite for further details ) and @xmath73 for the ideal ( perfect ) fluid , @xmath74 for the first order and @xmath75 for the second order theory discussed before . in the last equation",
    "@xmath76 is the relaxation time associated to @xmath72 .",
    "we now use ( [ evisc ] ) , using the same inputs as @xcite , namely massless pions and current algebra cross section .",
    "we can see on figure [ graphvisc ] that the correction due to viscosity compared to the ideal case is totally negligible not only for the ( non - physical but usual ) first order but also for the second order .",
    "our results are different from those presented in the original paper @xcite .",
    "the difference lies in fact in a small computational mistake in @xcite .",
    "the main point is that , contrary to what is claimed in @xcite , there are , in this simple approach , no appreciable effects .",
    "if we would stop here , we could say , as in the first part dedicated to the breaking of chiral symmetry that a realistic description of a pion gas can be achieved with the perfect fluid model .    however , we stress that this conclusion only holds because of the hypothesis used in @xcite",
    ". the temperature dependences of the viscosity @xmath68 and of the relaxation time @xmath76 are only valid for massless pions and when the cross - section for @xmath77 interaction is given by current algebra .",
    "if we take instead the realistic case of massive pions and the experimental cross - section , these dependences are completely different .",
    "for instance , @xmath68 increases with temperature @xcite instead of decreasing . with this realistic @xmath65-dependence for the viscosity and the relaxation time for the pions taken from @xcite",
    ", we obtain the curves plotted on figure [ graphvisc ] .",
    "we can now observe that the first and the second order are still close but they are now around 20% above the ideal fluid case .",
    "this means that dissipative effects imply a slower cooling of the system and should be incorporated in the simulations of heavy ion collisions .",
    "in the first part of this paper we have examined in a simple model an application of hydrodynamic equations with spontaneous breaking symmetry . in order to get an estimate of the magnitude of the effects ,",
    "we have used the one dimensional bjorken description of a heavy ion collision .",
    "we have shown that the model of the perfect fluid is almost correct  : the effect of the breaking of the symmetry is to give a correction of about 1% when no @xmath65-dependence of the pion decay constant is taken into account and a few percents when we consider a crude @xmath65-dependence . in a second part",
    "we have considered an other deviation from the perfect fluid model , namely the dissipation .",
    "the dissipative effects , when taken into account in a simple description @xcite are not so important as claimed in this reference but represent actually a few percents . on the contrary , we have obtained sizable effects with a correct @xmath65-dependence for the shear viscosity and the shear flow relaxation time . for example , for an initial temperature of 200 mev , the temperature goes from about 110 mev in the ideal case to 140 mev with our dissipative effects for @xmath78 .",
    "the whole conclusion of this paper is that the temperature profile generated from the perfect fluid approach and used in many simulations is almost correct if one takes into account only the effects of symmetry breaking . on the contrary , if we consider dissipative effects the profile can be substantially modified , that is we have a slower cooling of the pion gas ."
