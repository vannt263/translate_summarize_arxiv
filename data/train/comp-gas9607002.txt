    "growth kinetics in binary immiscible fluids has received much attention recently . phase separation in these systems",
    "has been simulated using a variety of techniques , including cell dynamical systems without hydrodynamics  @xcite and with oseen tensor hydrodynamics  @xcite ; time - dependent ginzburg - landau models without hydrodynamics  @xcite , and with hydrodynamics  @xcite ; as well as lattice - gas automata  @xcite and the related lattice - boltzmann techniques  @xcite .",
    "a central quantity in the study of growth kinetics is the time - dependent average domain size @xmath0 . for binary systems in the regime of sharp domain walls , this follows algebraic growth laws of the form @xmath7 . in general , for models without hydrodynamic interactions ( that is , when there is no conservation of momentum , as is often supposed to be the case for binary alloys ) the growth exponent is found to be @xmath8 , independent of the spatial dimension . if flow effects are relevant ( as is certainly the case for binary fluids ) , and the domain size @xmath9 is greater than the hydrodynamic length @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath12 is the density and @xmath13 is the surface tension coefficient , then one obtains @xmath14 in two spatial dimensions  @xcite . in the less commonly observed @xmath15 regime , two - dimensional lattice - gas automata  @xcite , molecular dynamics  @xcite and langevin dynamics simulations  @xcite",
    "find @xmath3 ; lattice - boltzmann studies , by contrast , suggest that @xmath16  @xcite",
    ". however , the lattice - boltzmann method does not include any thermal fluctuations which a renormalization group approach shows play a crucial role in causing this exponent to assume the value of @xmath17  @xcite . in three dimensions , for @xmath15",
    "the growth exponent is @xmath8 crossing over to @xmath18 at late times , with @xmath14 again if @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there are still some experimental and theoretical challenges in unraveling the behavior of systems in which both the order parameter and the momentum are locally conserved  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , for example , it is difficult if not impossible to study two - dimensional fluid systems .",
    "as far as numerical studies are concerned , it is important to recognize that three - dimensional simulations are particularly demanding on all the aforementioned techniques and so definitive results are harder to come by than in two dimensions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to take a look at domain growth and phase separation in two - dimensional , binary , immiscible fluids using a new simulation technique called dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) .",
    "the basic features of the method are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : whydpd ] ; here we simply note that it is a temporally discrete and spatially continuous , microscopic , particulate technique which yields correct hydrodynamical behavior in the macroscopic limit , while being easy to extend from two to three dimensions .",
    "comparatively little work has been published on dpd and , to our knowledge , nothing at all on its application to phase ordering kinetics .",
    "we shall find that the method is able to handle domain growth both qualitatively and quantitatively , yielding the correct scaling exponents and displaying a surface tension which satisfies laplace s law .",
    "although the present study is confined to the case of two - dimensional systems , we hope to return in the near future with a second paper dealing with the three - dimensional case .",
    "the motivation for the introduction of dissipative particle dynamics by hoogerbrugge and koelman  @xcite was to simulate the behavior of complex fluids .",
    "complex fluids include fluids in which there are many coexisting length and time scales , and fluids for which a hydrodynamic description is unknown or does not exist at all .",
    "examples are multiphase flows , flow in porous media , colloidal suspensions , microemulsions and polymeric fluids . whereas the traditional continuum - based approach to understanding and modeling",
    "the hydrodynamic behavior of such fluids , based on the formulation and solution of partial differential equations , has met with rather limited success , in more recent times new approaches have been undertaken , relying on a microscopic description of the fluid in question . in principle , the most accurate microscopic approach is based on the use of molecular dynamics ( md ) but the computational expense of attempting this is so severe that until now only a small number of flow phenomena in simple fluids have been achieved , and even then these have been restricted to two dimensions .",
    "lattice - gas automata ( lga ) have been used as a numerical technique for modeling hydrodynamics since their introduction in 1986 by frisch , hasslacher and pomeau  @xcite and by wolfram  @xcite , who showed that one could simulate the incompressible navier - stokes equations for a single component fluid using discrete boolean elements on a triangular lattice .",
    "in essence , lga dynamics is comprised of two elements : at each discrete timestep , particles first collide at vertices on the lattice , the collisional outcomes being controlled by local conservation of mass and momentum ; then the particles advect freely to neighboring sites .",
    "such lattice gas automaton models are computationally much faster than molecular dynamics , particularly since the natural time step  the mean free time between collisions  is several orders of magnitude greater than that required for md .",
    "the single phase lga method was subsequently generalized by rothman and keller  @xcite to permit the simulation of immiscible fluids , and indeed our present work shares certain features in common with their model , which has since been investigated with some degree of rigor  @xcite .",
    "even more recently , the technique has been extended to model amphiphilic fluids comprised of mixtures of oil , water and surfactant  @xcite .",
    "however , the lga method suffers from some disadvantages : the underlying lattice leads to the loss of galilean invariance which , although negligible for creep flows , does present problems for flow at finite reynolds numbers , while the treatment of three - dimensional fluids is computationally challenging owing to the complexity of the collisional look - up tables and the necessity of deploying a four - dimensional face - centered hypercubic lattice  @xcite .",
    "the lack of galilean invariance manifests itself by a spurious factor multiplying the inertial term in the momentum - conserving navier - stokes equation . for a single - phase lattice gas , this factor",
    "can easily be scaled away ; for compressible flow , or for multiphase flow with interfaces , however , the presence of this factor is more difficult to deal with , although various rather involved methods have been proposed to remove it  @xcite .",
    "dissipative particle dynamics was introduced with the intention of capturing the best aspects of md and lga ; it does away with the problems arising in the latter owing to the presence of a lattice , while maintaining the discrete time - stepping element which greatly accelerates the algorithm compared with md .",
    "moreover  and this is important from a practical perspective  in dpd the extension from two to three dimensions is very straightforward .",
    "the dpd method involves the motion of massive particles , which are allowed to move in space with their positions and momenta described by real numbers .",
    "the mass and momentum of these particles are conserved , but their energy is not . as in lga , the evolution of the model over one time step takes place in two substeps which are continually repeated : ( i ) an infinitesimally short impulse step , and ( ii ) a propagation step of duration @xmath20 . within the impulse substep ,",
    "the momentum of each particle ( @xmath21 ) is modified to reflect its interaction with the other particles . during the propagation",
    "step each particle coasts with constant velocity , completely ignoring every other particle . in mathematical terms , the impulse step is described by @xmath22 while the propagation step is @xmath23 in these equations @xmath24 is the mass of each particle , @xmath25 denotes the position of particle @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the unit vector pointing from particle @xmath28 to particle @xmath26 .",
    "henceforth , we shall assume for simplicity that all particles carry unit mass ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "@xmath30 is a scalar giving the momentum transferred from @xmath28 to @xmath26 , and in the original model presented by hoogerbrugge and koelman  @xcite has the form @xmath31 & if $ r_{ij } < r_c$ , \\cr 0 & if $ r_{ij } \\ge r_c$ , \\cr } \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the distance between particles @xmath26 and @xmath28 , and @xmath33 is the density of the system comprising @xmath34 particles in a volume @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is sampled from a uniform random distribution with mean and variance @xmath38 .",
    "this random component of the momentum transfer represents the stochastic effect of the collisions and gives rise to a fluid pressure , while the second , dissipative , term inside the square brackets of eqn .",
    "( [ originalomega ] ) is responsible for the fluid viscosity .",
    "the temperature is controlled by @xmath36 , whose variance is a measure of the thermal fluctuations in the system . note that @xmath39 , which occurs in the factor multiplying the one in square brackets in eqn .  ( [ originalomega ] ) , is a cut - off radius beyond which no interaction ( momentum transfer ) is possible .",
    "the presence of this cut - off makes the interactions local and the dpd algorithm correspondingly fast .",
    "the property of detailed balance is satisfied by dpd  @xcite and so a gibbsian equilibrium state is guaranteed to exist . however , the statistical mechanical analysis of espaol and warren  @xcite confirmed that the original dpd model presented by hoogerbrugge and koelman  @xcite does not lead to the physically correct equilibrium distribution , a feature which is particularly marked when the relative time step @xmath40 .",
    "this choice of time step ( @xmath41 ) has , nevertheless , been used in almost all of the dpd work so far reported on  @xcite .",
    "two simple modifications to the basic model are suggested by espaol and warren  @xcite which ensure that the dpd equilibrium state is the canonical ensemble .",
    "the first modification is reducing the time step length ( a factor of ten is sufficient ) , and the second is the inclusion of an extra factor of @xmath42 into the dissipative term in the change of momentum eqn .  ( [ originalomega ] ) , so that the momentum transfer scalar @xmath30 becomes @xmath43 .\\ ] ] this alteration guarantees that the model obeys a fluctuation - dissipation theorem which is very similar to that obtained in conventional brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "the theorem enables one to relate the amplitude of the noise ( that is , the fluctuations in @xmath36 ) to the temperature of the system .    in the original paper by hoogerbrugge and koelman ,",
    "it was stated ( but not demonstrated ) that the dpd model of a simple one - component fluid satisfies the navier - stokes equations in the mean - field limit  @xcite .",
    "espaol has recently explicitly derived the hydrodynamic equations for the mass and momentum density fields in dpd  @xcite .",
    "however , these equations are not the central results of espaol s paper , since the dpd properties of mass and momentum conservation , coupled with galilean invariance and the isotropy of the microscopic equations of motion , effectively guarantee that at a macroscopic level the navier - stokes equations will emerge .",
    "what is more significant is the correction of the original simple expressions for the speed of sound and the kinematic viscosity to more complicated results  @xcite .",
    "immiscible fluid mixtures exist because individual molecules attract similar and repel dissimilar molecules .",
    "the most common example of such behavior arises in mixtures of oil and water ; the non - polar , hydrophobic molecules of oil attract one another through short range van der waals forces , while the polar water molecules enjoy more complex , long - range hydrophilic attractions which are dominated by electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonds . at the atomistic level employed in molecular dynamics , such interactions demand a detailed treatment . however , to obtain accurate meso- and macroscopic level descriptions using dpd , the microscopic model can be drastically simplified .",
    "to model the interactions of dissimilar particles in a binary immiscible fluid within dpd , the simplest modification to the single phase dpd algorithm is to introduce a new variable , called the `` color '' ( by analogy with the rothman - keller model ) , which has two possible values  for example , `` red '' for oil and `` blue '' for water .",
    "identical interactions are used between particles of the same color , while we increase the mean and variance of the random variable @xmath36 when particles of different color interact , which has the effect of creating a repulsion between particles from the two different phases  @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath44 & if particles are of the same phase , \\cr u[0,2(\\pi_0 + \\pi_{rep } ) ] & if particles are of different phases .",
    "\\cr } \\ ] ]    it should be emphasized that eqn .",
    "( [ rk - dpd ] ) is a minimal modification to the single - phase dpd model and is symmetric under the interchange of particle colors",
    ". it would be quite straightforward to generalize this to the asymmetric case by , for example , making the mean @xmath38 of the stochastic terms different for the two colors and/or likewise adjusting the dissipative terms through the selection of different values of @xmath45 in eqn .",
    "( [ alteredomega ] ) . in the present paper , however , we shall not consider such situations , preferring to concentrate on the properties of the simpler model implied by eqn .",
    "( [ rk - dpd ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that detailed balance is also satisfied by the two - phase dpd model  @xcite . as for the single - phase dpd fluid , one can show that , macroscopically , the navier - stokes equations are obeyed within homogeneous regions of each of the two immiscible fluids .",
    "the implementation of the dpd algorithm is very similar to that of conventional md algorithms  @xcite .",
    "for example , the periodic spatial domain ( the simulation cell ) is divided into a regular array of equally - sized link cells , such that each side of the rectangular domain has an integer number of cells and each cell is at least @xmath39 across .",
    "each link cell consists of a dynamically - allocated array of particles and pointers to the neighboring cells .",
    "individual particles consist of the position - momentum vector pair and a color index .    for each time step",
    "we calculate first the impulse and then the propagation step , as described in eqns .",
    "( [ impulsestep ] ) and ( [ propagationstep ] ) . in the impulse step",
    "we iterate through the particles in each link cell , calculating the change in momentum of each particle as it interacts with the particles in the same and neighboring link cells .",
    "since the momentum is modified by particle pairs we need to ignore half of the neighboring cells to avoid duplication .",
    "when considering a new particle pair we first compare the square of the separation distance with @xmath46 , and skip to the next particles if the pair is out of range . in the propagation step we iterate through the particles in each link cell again , allowing them to coast for time @xmath20 .",
    "the complete state of the system may be written to file , and other calculations to determine for example the temperature and pressure of the system can also be performed .",
    "given constant @xmath39 and number density @xmath47 the system scales linearly ( in both computation time and memory size ) with increasing number of particles , @xmath34 . to give an example",
    ", the calculation of the motion of a system of 40,000 dpd particles with number density @xmath48 for 10,000 time steps takes 11  hours cpu time and 13  mb memory on an 133  mflop / s ( theoretical ) dec alpha .",
    "several simulations were run to model the binary separation of a mixture of two immiscible phases . by definition , for studies of symmetric quenches , exactly half of the particles",
    "were in the `` red '' phase and half in the `` blue '' phase .",
    "asymmetric quenches were studied with the ratio of the numbers of colored particles at both 60:40 and 70:30 .",
    "the initial state of the system was completely random ; the positions of red and blue particles were chosen from a uniform distribution , and their velocities were chosen from a uniform distribution in direction and a gaussian distribution in magnitude .",
    "physically , this initial state corresponds to starting with the system quenched in temperature from a state above the spinodal point at which the fluids are miscible .",
    "a reasonably large number of particles ( 40,000 ) was used in order to enhance the statistical accuracy of the data obtained during these simulations .",
    "care was taken to ensure the box dimensions were suitable for accurately simulating the phase segregation process for large times without the size of the domains becoming close to that of the periodic box , thereby introducing artifacts into the observed behavior .",
    "simulations started from a symmetric quench were allowed to evolve for 10,000 time steps and the asymmetric quenches were evolved for 100,000 time steps .",

    ", the mean of @xmath59 weighted by the structure function is often calculated . however , unlike the case of lattice - based simulation techniques , the positions of the particles in dpd are described by continuous variables rather than discrete points on a grid , and so the structure function is meaningful even as @xmath60 approaches infinity . the nature of the system is such that the structure function has a finite value throughout @xmath61-space , approaching a constant value at large distances from the origin , so that the mean is not defined . since we are not interested in the asymptotic value of the structure function , a function @xmath62 , which vanishes far from the origin , was fit to the grid of points containing the meaningful values of @xmath63 .",

    "this exponent was observed at all times in these off - critical quenches , just as in previously reported langevin simulations  @xcite .",
    "some short simulations ( 3,000 time steps long ) were also run to determine the early - time exponent for a symmetric quench where momentum is not conserved .",

    "the value of @xmath72 was chosen since the immiscible phases then regularly reach complete phase separation asymptotically and yet the system does not behave too randomly .      the detailed way in which phase separation occurs in binary fluids depends , among other things , on the interfacial tension which exists between the two immiscible phases . in particular , as noted earlier , when hydrodynamic effects are important , the crossover between diffusive ( lifshitz - slyozov ) and hydrodynamic regimes should occur when the domain size @xmath0 is larger than the hydrodynamic length @xmath73 , where @xmath11 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath12 is the fluid density and @xmath13 is the surface tension coefficient .",
    "a further important test of our dpd model for binary fluid separation is thus to check on the existence of a surface tension between the two phases by confirming the validity of laplace s law using a series of bubble simulations inspired by earlier lattice gas analogues  @xcite .    as with the domain growth simulations of sec .",
