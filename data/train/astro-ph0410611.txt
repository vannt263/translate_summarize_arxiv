    "the milky way offers a unique laboratory for testing the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario through direct evidence of past merging and tidal disruption events , which result in extensive stellar streams or large scale substructures in the galactic halo or even in the disk ( navarro 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "resolving such tidal streams into stars and measuring the phase - space coordinates for these stars , provides a fossil dynamical accretion record of unparalleled accuracy .",
    "these can be directly compared with n - body simulations in order to reconstruct their dynamical history and their impact on the milky way at the present and recent epochs .",
    "recently , the sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ) team reported the discovery of a coherent giant stellar structure at low galactic latitudes ( newberg et al .",
    "2002 ; yanny et al .",
    "2003 ) , which appears to form a ring around the milky way .",
    "since then , there has been a tremendous amount of follow - up observational effort probing its structure and kinematics in order to understand its origin ( see majewski 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "n - body simulations ( martin et al . 2004a ; pearrubia et al . 2004 ) shows that this ring structure can be naturally attributed to the tidal stream of a dwarf galaxy ( named the monoceros tidal stream , or the galactic anticenter tidal stream ) .",
    "if this stellar overdensity ring is a tidal tail feature , it must have had a `` parent '' galaxy , which may or may not be completely disrupted by now .",
    "the existence and location of such a parent galaxy is still controversial ; the best candidate is the canis major ( cma ) dwarf galaxy candidate , a strong , ellipsoidal overdensity of red giant stars , discovered in the namesake constellation by martin et al .",
    "( 2004a ) from an analysis of the 2mass survey .",
    "bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) in the surroundings of the candidate cma dwarf , concluding that the system is situated at 8@xmath6 1 kpc from the sun and that it is composed of a metal - rich , intermediate - age stellar population .",
    "as cma is only @xmath13 degrees from the galactic plane , momany et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested an alternative interpretation , namely that this over - density is the signature of the galactic warp in this direction of the sky , and not a distinct satellite .",
    "however , martin et al .",
    "( 2004b ) reported a narrow distribution of radial velocities for the center of this structure , and argued on this basis for the interpretation of cma as an accreted dwarf satellite remnant , in an orbit near the galactic plane .    to help discriminate between these two hypothesis  accreted dwarf galaxy , or stellar warp  , we present here deep broad - band photometry of the cma center . as our results confirm and greatly strengthen the case that the stellar over - density towards cma is part of a distinct dwarf galaxy , we refer to it as cma dwarf throughout .",
    "our observations were carried out in @xmath14 and @xmath15 johnson - cousins filters with the 2.2 m eso / mpg telescope at the la silla observatory ( chile ) in service mode during december 14 - 17th , 2003 .",
    "we used the wide - field imager ( wfi ) installed at the prime focus , which holds eight @xmath16 pixel eev chips , with a scale of @xmath17 pixel@xmath18 .",
    "our field covers a total area of about @xmath19 deg@xmath20 and is centered at galactic coordinates ( l , b)=(240.15 , -8.07 ) , which is , within the uncertainties , the nominal center of the cma over - density given by martin et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "the total exposure times were 3700s and 2700s in @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . a shorter exposure of 100s in both bands was also taken to recover the brighter part of the cmd .",
    "bias and flat - field corrections were done with iraf .",
    "daophot and allstar ( stetson 1994 ) were used to obtain the photometry of the resolved stars .",
    "aperture corrections were estimated using a set of about 50 isolated , bright stars in the cma frame , with a variance of @xmath21 .",
    "transformation of the instrumental magnitudes into the standard photometric system were obtained from observations of the landolt standard field sa95 taking during two photometric nights bracketing our observations and using the atmospheric extinction coefficients estimated on november 8th , 2003 taken from the wfi homepage . putting all the errors together , the total zero - point uncertainty of our photometry can be estimated to be about @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for individual bands .",
    "the resulting catalogue of stars was filtered using the error parameters given by allstar , retaining only stars with acceptable chi and sharp parameters and @xmath25 0.2 and @xmath260.2 .",
    "artificial star tests were performed in the usual way ( see aparicio , carrera & martnez - delgado 2001 ) using a total of 20000 artificial stars to check the observational effects and estimate the completeness factor as a function of magnitude .",
    "[ fig1]a shows the [ @xmath27,@xmath15 ] cmd of the center of the possible cma dwarf based our @xmath29 data . the stellar densities in this cmd",
    "confirm inmediately that the distribution of stars in the milky way in this low - latitude direction grossly deviate from the expectations of a smooth thin / thick / halo distribution : there is a conspicuous main - sequence ( ms ) feature ( labelled ms in fig 1b ) , with a possible arc - shape turnoff at @xmath15= 18.48 @xmath6 0.11 mag .",
    "the @xmath27 colour used on our cmd provides the separation of the redder plume populated by thick disk stars ( the parallel sequence running from @xmath30\\sim$ ] ( 15,1.0 ) to @xmath30\\sim$ ] ( 19,1.6 ) ) from this ms feature , which is about @xmath3 0.2mag bluer at @xmath31 .",
    "secondly , a second plume of possible ms stars ( labelled _ bp _ in fig .",
    "1b ) is observed extending brighter and bluer than the ms - turnoff and reaching @xmath32 , avoiding the galactic star contamination .",
    "this blue extension can not be reproduced by any star - count models of the milky way ( see also bellazzini et al . 2004 ) and is similar to those observed in the cmd of local group ( lg ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( draco : aparicio et al .",
    "2001 ; ursa minor : carrera , aparicio & martnez - delgado 2002 ) .",
    "although it could be produced by blue straggler stars rather than by ms stars of the dwarf galaxy ( see discussion in carrera et al .",
    "2002 ) , the fact that it departs from the ms at @xmath33 19.0 ( fainter than the ms turnoff ) is more compatible with the star formation burst hypothesis than the blue stragglers one , suggesting that the cma system has had at least two distinct epoch of star formation .",
    "the narrow distribution of these blue stars strongly suggests that they are all at a similar distance , which would not expected if the galactic warp / flare were the origin of this stellar population .",
    "our diagram also shows evidence of a possible red clump ( labelled _ _ rc in fig .",
    "1b ) at @xmath34 1.5 and @xmath35 , but a suitable control field or radial velocity follow - up is necessary to confirm this over - density as part of the cma dwarf .",
    "all the cmd features described above can be easier identified in fig  [ fig1]b , that shows a synthetic cmd of one of the possible solutions for the stellar population of the cma dwarf ( see sec .",
    "4.1 ) overplotted in our observed [ @xmath27,@xmath14 ] cmd .",
    "the remarkable similarity of the morphology of this model cmd with the observed one also supports the dwarf nature of cma .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the [ @xmath27 , @xmath14 ] cmd based on our long exposure data .",
    "this cmd reveals a prominent , high contrast , and well - populated ms feature extending beyond our limiting magnitude ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the colour width of this ms feature remains roughly constant along a large magnitude range and is comparable to those observed in the cmd of lg dwarf galaxies or massive globular clusters .",
    "this evidence strongly confirms the presence of a limited range in distance , and therefore associated with a possibly still bound stellar system whose distance line - of - sight size and stellar density are investigated in the next section .",
    "our cmd does not show any unambiguous , convincing signature of the bright , post - ms populations  the red clump ( rc ) , horizontal branch , rr lyrae stars , red giant branch stars  that must accompany the clearly detected ms stars .",
    "those post - ms classes of stars have been extensively used to constrain the distance and stellar population properties of lg dwarf galaxies .",
    "consequently , our data are not well suited for a reliable distance estimate to cma , as there are degeneracies between stellar population assumptions , the reddening and the distance , when considering only the ms in the cmd . in spite of this degeneracy",
    ", we try here to set some limits on the distance to cma dwarf by fitting the observed ms with synthetic cmds , assuming some different evolutionary scenarios for the galaxy .",
    "however , it is important to stress that these are not the only possible solutions and than more data from alternative distance indicators are necessary to confirm the distance reported in this paper .    adopting e(b - v )",
    "= 0.213@xmath60.029 mag for our field from the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis(1998 ; sfd98 ) dust map , our best model cmd fitting for an old population ( age @xmath411gyr , with mean z=0.006 ) provides an upper limit on the distance modulus of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 kpc ) . for a younger stellar population similar to those reported by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( age 410gyr , with mean z=0.006 ) , one gets @xmath40 ( @xmath41 kpc ) .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the sfd98 dust maps could overestimate the actual reddening of our field ( bonifacio , monai & beers 2000 ) . to check this ,",
    "we have obtained e(b - v ) data for individual stars in the wfi field from a star - by - star interpolation of the sfd98 dust maps .",
    "we find that the e(b - v ) distribution is skewed , with about 27% of the stars across our cmd are affected by e(b - v ) @xmath4 0.2 . therefore , we ignore stars assigned e(b - v ) @xmath4 0.3 because they can not have a significant effect on our distance and line - of - sight size estimates . for the mean @xmath6 standard deviation of the remaining stars ,",
    "we obtain e(b - v ) = 0.08@xmath60.07mag .",
    "this lower reddening value does not permit an acceptable ms fitting for the two former model cmds , as both produce ms features than are bluer than observed .",
    "an acceptable fitting is obtained by increasing the mean metallicity of the galaxy ( mean z=0.01 ) , yielding a distance modulus of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 kpc ) .",
    "this last value is in very good agreement with previous estimates based on different cmd indicators ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2004 ; martin et al .",
    "2004b ) and it is adopted as the distance to cma throughout .",
    "to estimate the line - of - sight extent ( or `` depth '' ) of cma analyse the observed width of the ms , @xmath44 .",
    "near the ms turn - off the ms is steep , and at the faintest magnitudes measurement errors may dominate the width .",
    "hence , we consider the b - band apparent magnitude distribution of stars in the ( @xmath27 ) color range of 1.50 - 1.55mag , using the long exposure data ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we modelled this distribution as the linear sum of two components : 1 ) the smooth distribution of underlying stars due to the galactic warp and thin disk , by a linear function ; 2 ) the cma ms , by a gaussian function , characterized by a standard deviation @xmath44 .",
    "even if all cma stars were at the same distance , @xmath45 would be non - zero , and could be described by the quadrature sum of three components : the intrinsic ms size due to a range of stellar population ages and metallicities , = -0.48dex ) . ]",
    "plus the contribution to the ms width from observational effects ( @xmath46 ) ; and the differential reddening of the field ( @xmath47 ) , estimated from the sfd98 dust maps .",
    "we then attribute the remaining width of the ms to the distance distribution of the cma stars ( @xmath48 ) . in brief , we fitted the distribution in fig .",
    "3 ( in a @xmath49 sense ) to a linear function at b=20 - 20.5 and 23.5 - 24mag and fitted a gaussian function in a non - linear least squares way after subtracting the linear fit .",
    "the fitting was repeated for two adjacent colour intervals in order to obtain a statistical uncertainty in the ms width .",
    "their mean and standard deviation data are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] , together with the rest of the budget used to determine the line - of - sight size of cma .",
    "our best fitting @xmath50 , converted into kilo - parsecs , yields @xmath51=0.8@xmath60.15kpc or fwhm = 1.95kpc ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . based on 2mass data , martin et al .",
    "( 2004b ) report that angular extent of the over - density corresponds to a fwhm of about @xmath3 4.2kpc ( at a helio - centric distance of 7.1@xmath61.3kpc ) , significantly larger than the line - of - sight value estimated here .",
    "this is not necessarily inconsistent , because severe tidal perturbations may cause a tangential streching of the cma dwarf .",
    "in addition , the estimated size of cma dwarf can provide a reliable estimation of its mass under the assumption that bound stellar systems undergoing disruption have a spatial extension similar or larger than the jacobi limit , as pearrubia et al ( 2004 ) find for the monoceros stream progenitor . in that case",
    "( binney & tremaine 1986 ; equation 7 - 84 ) , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the galaxy mass within @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the jacobi limit ( also called tidal radius ) . adopting @xmath56 ( which accounts approximately for 96% of the dwarf mass ) and the mass profile used by pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we find @xmath57 , indicating that the present mass of the cma dwarf should be similar to those predicted by our model of the monoceros stream progenitor ( @xmath58 : pearrubia et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "finally , in order to compare the size of cma with those of known dwarf galaxies , we estimate the line - of - sight half - brightness radius , r@xmath59 , from the gaussian model of the line - of - sight profile given in fig.3 .",
    "we obtain r@xmath59=0.94 @xmath6 0.18 ( random ) @xmath6 0.18 ( systematic)kpc .",
    "this size is in agreement with the model prediction ( pearrubia et al .",
    "2004 ) ; but is significantly bigger than that of several dwarf galaxies in the lg ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ; their table 4 ) .",
    "we estimate the central surface brightness ( sb ) of the cma dwarf by matching the observed surface density of ms stars to scale those derived from a ( candidate ) synthetic cmd for the cma galaxy ( 2.5 - 15gyr ; z=0.006 ) for which the integrated magnitude is known .",
    "we used the short exposure data and counted stars on the upper ms in a small box such that 1@xmath60 1.5 and 18 @xmath6119 ; the position of this cmd box allows a significant sample of the dominant cma stellar population . to correct the ms star - counts for contamination of milky way stars",
    ", we use the cmd of a control field obtained at the galactic position ( l , b)=(240,+15 ) , taken from our recent survey to investigate the extent and stellar population of the cma dwarf ( butler et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we used star counts from the red plume region of thick disk ms stars ( where 0.5 @xmath62 b - r @xmath62 1.5 and 15 @xmath62 r @xmath62 16.5 ) in the control and cma fields to subtract a scaled contamination level from the cma ms star selection box mentioned above .",
    "we find @xmath63 = 23.3 @xmath6 0.1magarcsec@xmath8 ( taken as the intensity - weighted average of @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) , where the sb uncertainty was estimated by taking poisson statistical errors in the star counts .",
    "that value is very similar to those of milky dsph satellites ( mateo 1998 ) , and provides a further evidence that we have detected a part of the main body of a dwarf galaxy and not a piece of a possible tidal stream , whose typical sb would be expected to lie in the range of 30.0 to 31.5 magarcsec@xmath8",
    "( johnston et al . 1999 ) .    to estimate the total v - band luminosity",
    ", we use an exponential sb profile with a ( near - ir ) scale length of 0.73@xmath60.05kpc ( martin et al .",
    "2004a ) with the mean heliocentric distance taken to be 7.1kpc .",
    "we obtained @xmath66= -14.5@xmath60.1mag , corresponding to a total v - band intensity log ( i@xmath67 ) = 7.7@xmath60.1 .",
    "this yields a total mass for the satellite of @xmath68 = 5 @xmath69 10@xmath70@xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ) ) . assuming the mass - to - light ratio of cma is in the range @xmath73 , in solar units , ( which contains the majority of the lg dsphs ) , the present remnant of the cma dwarf would have a total mass of @xmath74 , consistent with the value obtained from the observational extension of the satellite and from the prediction of our theoretical simulations ( see sec .",

    "[ cma_size ] places this stellar system among the dwarf galaxies in the the @xmath10size plane ( see pasquali et al .",

    "in addition , cma follows the well - defined @xmath11 relationship shown by caldwell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , assuming the stellar component of the galaxy has an average metallicity of @xmath75\\sim -0.4 $ ] ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2004 ) , this galaxy is , like the sgr dsph , an outlier of the well - known @xmath75 -m_v$ ] relation , since it is too metal rich for its estimated absolute magnitude .",
    "this suggests , as in the case of sgr , that a different mechanism ( possibly tidal stripping ) is predominantly driving its star formation history .",
    "derived parameters for the cma overdensity are given in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "from our data we have established that the putative center of cma is a very high contrast density feature that as has very narrow radial extent , @xmath76 .",
    "these results strongly support the interpretation of a distinct , possibly still bound stellar system whose properties are consistent with those expected for the remnant of a partially disrupted dwarf satellite . in turn",
    ", the high density contrast and the limited line - of - sight extent of the cma would be very difficult to be reconciled ( if at all ) with a flared or warped galactic disk viewed in projection ( momamy et al .",
    "although the obtained properties for this satellite ( table 2 ) in this study are subject to considerable uncertainties ( stellar population , galactic contamination , radial profile ) , they are in agreement with those of the known milky way dsph satellites ( mateo 1998 ) and with the known size - luminosity relation followed by milky way dwarf spheroidals .    at a distance of 8 kpc ,",
    "cma is the closest dwarf galaxy known .",
    "it may not only be the parent of the galactic low - latitude stellar stream , but also a unique laboratory for testing galaxy evolution theories . in particular , our cmd shows the availability for first time of thousands of ms stars of different ages in a magnitude range suited to high resolution spectroscopy - based abundance studies using 4-meter class telescopes .",
    "this will allow one to study the sfh of a dwarf galaxy with unprecedented spectral resolution , and is therefore a top candidate for chemo - dynamical modelling of dwarf galaxy evolution in the galaxy .",
