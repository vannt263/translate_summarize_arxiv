    "almost two decades on , branes are evermore ubiquitous in the models constructed to understand particle physics and cosmology , with all their how ? s and why ?",
    "s . as fundamental objects ,",
    "they are the d - branes and ns - branes ( or m - branes ) of string ( or m ) theory , but within a low - energy effective field theory description , they are introduced as braneworlds . often these braneworlds are considered as infinitely thin but finite tension objects , like for their more fundamental cousins , although sometimes it proves necessary to resolve their structure by adding some thickness .",
    "a codimension one brane necessarily forms a boundary in the bulk space , since there is no path which can lead from one side to the other without traversing the brane .",
    "the gravitational backreaction of these objects is well understood ; whilst the metric is continuous across the brane , its first derivative can have finite discontinuities .",
    "branes with more than one transverse dimension are qualitatively different , and much harder , due to their sourcing of singularities in the transverse space . still , codimension two branes can also be handled with some control ; they backreact on the geometry in such a way as to produce relatively mild conical singularities .",
    "the construction of solutions sourced by branes , with up to two codimensions , in various field theory models is by now a well - developed art . in 5d ,",
    "the archetype is of course the construction of randall and sundrum @xcite . in 6d , we take the general warped braneworld compactifications ( `` conical - ggp solutions '' ) of 6d n=1 gauged supergravity @xcite found in @xcite as representative .",
    "these solutions additionally invoke fluxes , which are also playing a dominant role in string compactifications today , and indeed models with two extra dimensions are the simplest in which flux compactifications can be studied .",
    "having established the solutions , we can begin to ask about their physics : are they stable to small perturbations ?",
    "what are the symmetries and particle content of the low energy effective field theory ?",
    "is it chiral ?",
    "what are the modifications to 4d einsteinian gravity ? what would be the effective vacuum energy measured by a 4d observer ?",
    "what role do the branes play in these and other phenomena ? and so on .",
    "the first step towards answering these questions is to analyze the classical spectra of small fluctuations around the solution .",
    "a number of such studies have been made recently for the conical - ggp solutions .",
    "in @xcite we worked out the spectra for certain 4d gauge fields and fermions present in the model and no tachyons or ghosts were found amongst them .",
    "a similar ( marginal ) stability was found in @xcite , where the axially symmetric modes for some of the scalar perturbations were calculated .",
    "the spectrum for the gravitino has also been analyzed in @xcite . in @xcite , meanwhile , we studied the tachyonic instabilities that can arise from the non - axially symmetric , 4d scalar fluctuations descending from 6d gauge fields , and charged under the background fluxes . whether a given model with a given flux suffers from this instability turns out to depend on the tensions of the branes present .",
    "we now intend to complete the spectral analysis for the bosonic fluctuations about the braneworld solutions of 6d supergravity .",
    "our particular focus in this paper is on the so - called salam - sezgin sector  that arising from the supergravity - tensor multiplet and the @xmath0 gauge multiplet in which the background monopole lies  which was partially treated in @xcite .",
    "the remaining sectors have been completed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will calculate the corresponding spectra for the 4d spin-2 and  for unwarped backgrounds  spin-1 and spin-0 fields .",
    "the model that we are studying is complicated , and technically difficult .",
    "however , this goes hand in hand with its advantage of generality , and indeed the results for several simpler scenarios can be extracted from our work at its various stages",
    ".    our approach will be that established in @xcite , where a formalism was developed to analyze the spectra of small perturbations about arbitrary solutions of einstein , yang - mills and scalar systems .",
    "the first part of this paper can be considered as a generalization of that work , where we now include the presence of thin source 3-branes and extra bulk fields that are generically present in supergravity theories ; the dilaton and anti - symmetric two - form potential . with little extra cost",
    ", we actually keep the number of dimensions transverse to the brane general .",
    "we first derive the general form of the bilinear action that describes the behaviour of small fluctuations .",
    "for codimension - two or higher , we include fluctuations of the brane positions in the transverse directions , the so - called `` branons '' .",
    "we then apply the light - cone gauge ( for bulk fields ) and static gauge ( for branons ) to restrict to physical degrees of freedom , and decouple the dynamics for the spin-2 , -1 and -0 fluctuations .",
    "the gauge - fixed bilinear action thus obtained provides the starting point to calculate the kaluza - klein ( kk ) spectra for the conical - ggp solutions , as well as , for example , the 5d randall - sundrum models and the non - supersymmetric einstein - yang mills(-dilaton ) model in any dimension .",
    "in the second part of this paper , we use these general equations to study the behaviour of braneworld models in 6d ( along the way also recover some of well - known aspects of the 5d scenarios ) . here , since we include the backreaction of the branes , the dynamics of the branons are not well - defined .",
    "therefore , to study the spin-0 sector , we choose to truncate the branons by _",
    "e.g. _ placing the branes at orbifold fixed points , or taking the brane tensions to be very large making the branes rigid within our range of validity .",
    "meanwhile , the conical singularities in the curvature that are induced by the codimension two branes do not prevent us from understanding the behaviour of the bulk fluctuations .",
    "we are able to derive the spectrum for the 4d spin-2 fields in the model s full warped generality .",
    "the spin-1 and spin-0 sectors present large coupled differential systems , and by finding a set of harmonics on the 2d internal space ( the `` rugbyball '' ) , we are also able to solve these systems analytically for the unwarped case . in this way , we obtain _ all _ the 4d modes for unwarped compactifications with positive tension brane sources , and qualitatively , we observe the same behaviour as in the smooth sphere compactification without branes  including marginal stability .    in the presence of negative tension codimension - two branes ,",
    "meanwhile , the physics can surprise . here , despite the fact that brane sources clearly break the @xmath4 isometries of the sphere to @xmath0 , three massless spin-1 fields can be found amongst the kk spectra for special values of the conical deficit angle .",
    "these special deficit angles , @xmath5 , allow three killing vectors to be well - defined everywhere outside the branes , although only one of them can be globally integrated to an isometry .    whether or not the massless vectors are gauge bosons of an enhanced gauge symmetry in the 4d theory can be understood by going beyond bilinear order and considering the interaction terms .",
    "we find the presence of kk modes that are not in well - defined representations of the @xmath4 generated by the killing vectors , and therefore the full 4d theory does not enjoy an @xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "for this reason , we do not expect the classical masslessness of the vector fields to survive quantum corrections .",
    "meanwhile , all our bosonic massless modes do fall into well - defined @xmath4 representations , and therefore we argue that the classical low energy 4d effective field theory  obtained by truncating to the massless sector ",
    "does enjoy an enhanced kk gauge symmetry beyond the isometries !",
    "moreover , it appears that the low energy theory does not distinguish between compactifications on the smooth sphere and these singular , deformed spheres .",
    "let us now give an outline for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the first part presents a rather general analysis that determines the dynamics of perturbations in braneworld compactifications . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the model ( both theories and background solutions ) and discuss the scenarios to which our analysis can be applied . in section 3 , we introduce the perturbations about the background , obtain the bilinear action that describes their dynamics , and discuss the local symmetries of this action . in section 4",
    ", we use these symmetries to fix to the `` light cone static gauge '' , and give the bilinear action in this gauge , in which the different spin sectors decouple .",
    "then begins the second part , which uses the previous results to study the 4d fields that emerge in various scenarios . in section 5 ,",
    "our main interest is in the braneworld solutions of 6d supergravity , but we also discuss a non - supersymmetric 6d model and the 5d randall - sundrum models . in the main text we present the kk spectra for spin-2 and spin-1 fields and identify the massless spin-0 fields ;",
    "the complete spin-0 sector can be found in the appendices .",
    "finally , we understand in detail the physical significance of the extra massless 4d vector modes that can appear in the spectra , and the gauge invariance that emerges in the 4d theory .",
    "we summarise our results in section 6 , before concluding in section 7 .",
    "we begin with the definition of our model . the main focus of the present paper will be a class of bosonic 6d field theories with thin codimension - two branes .",
    "in particular we are interested in the bosonic part of 6d n=1 gauged supergravity @xcite .",
    "however , throughout the article we shall keep a general space - time dimension @xmath6 as far as possible , and certain truncations of the field content allow our analysis to be applied to several different scenarios , including the non - supersymmetric einstein - yang - mills theory or the randall - sundrum model .",
    "the basic ingredients of our model are the higher dimensional metric @xmath7 , where the space - time indices run over @xmath8 , and the gauge field @xmath9 of a compact lie group @xmath10 .",
    "these are bulk fields in the sense that they depend on all the space - time coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "we also want to consider a certain number @xmath12 of 3-branes embedded in the @xmath6-dimensional space time .",
    "to do so we introduce , following ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath12 functions @xmath13 , which represent the positions of the branes in the @xmath6-dimensional space time .",
    "the @xmath14 represent the 4d coordinates on the brane , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the 4d indices .",
    "not all the space - time components of @xmath17 are physical degrees of freedom : 4 space - time components for each @xmath18 can be gauged away by using the 4d ( general ) coordinate transformation invariance acting on @xmath14 @xcite , as we will explicitly do in subsection [ gauge - fixing ] .",
    "we consider @xmath17 to be a brane field because it depends only on a 4d world - volume coordinate .",
    "these fields are important to introduce the branes in a covariant way , and indeed we can construct the induced metrics on the branes by means of g_^k= g_mn(y_k(x_k))_y^m_k(x_k)_y^m(x_k ) .",
    "[ brane - metric ]    in order to complete the bosonic part of the 6d supergravity , one should add other bulk fields in addition to @xmath7 and @xmath9 , that is a dilaton @xmath19 and a 2-form field @xmath20 , which emerge from the graviton multiplet and an antisymmetric tensor multiplet @xcite .",
    "we will refer to @xmath20 as the kalb - ramond field .",
    "moreover , concerning the 6d supergravity , we shall assume that @xmath10 is a product of simple groups that include a @xmath21 gauged r - symmetry .",
    "in general one can also add some hypermultiplets @xcite , which turn out to be important to cancel gauge and gravitational anomalies @xcite . in the bosonic sector",
    "this leads to additional scalar fields @xmath22 ( hyperscalars ) in some representation of @xmath10 ; however , from now on we set @xmath23 .",
    "we do so because we are interested in the linear perturbations which mix with the @xmath6-dimensional gravitational fluctuations @xmath24 : indeed , for the class of backgrounds we are interested in ( see subsection [ eom ] ) , the @xmath22 decouple from @xmath24 .",
    "their inclusion should be straightforward .",
    "therefore the bulk and the brane field contents that we consider are respectively :    \\{g_mn , _",
    "m , , b_mn } \\{y^m_k(x_k ) , ... } .[fields ] the dots in the second set of ( [ fields ] ) represent additional brane fields that we can always introduce , but which are not required by general covariance ; for example they can be the fields of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "we split the action functional @xmath25 into the bulk action @xmath26 , which depends only on the bulk fields , and the brane action @xmath27 that is a functional of the brane fields as well .",

    "[ hkr]the function @xmath43 is the dilaton potential . in the supersymmetric model",
    "this is fixed to be @xmath44 .",
    "meanwhile , we consider the following 3-brane action s_b= _ k(-t_kd^4x_k)-td^4x , [ sb ] where @xmath45 is the determinant of ( [ brane - metric ] ) and @xmath46 are the tensions of the branes . from now on ( unless otherwise stated ) we suppress the index @xmath18 , as we have done on the right hand side of ( [ sb ] ) .",
    "the reader may have noticed that we have not introduced the gibbons - hawking boundary term , which is generically necessary to treat codimension one branes @xcite .",
    "indeed , we shall apply our analysis only to those codimension one models whose branes are placed on orbifold fixed points , in which case the gibbons - hawking boundary term is not present @xcite .",
    "we can summarise by saying that our analysis will apply to the following two types of models :    1 .",
    "6d n=1 gauged supergravity .",
    "einstein - yang - mills theories , with a dilaton or cosmological constant @xmath47 , for a general space - time dimension .",
    "the second case includes , for example , the rs models @xcite or the non - supersymmetric 6d einstein - yang - mills-@xmath47 ( eym@xmath47 ) model @xcite .",
    "they can be obtained by simply fixing the appropriate dimension and setting @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "even if our main interest is in models of type 1 we will also consider the second class for several reasons .",
    "in this way , we will see that our results can be applied in quite general contexts , and it will also provide interesting additional ways to check our formulae . moreover , in the future it should help us to figure out the role of supersymmetry in the linear perturbations .    finally , it is important to note that the actions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are invariant with respect to both the @xmath6-dimensional and the 4d coordinate transformations ( acting respectively on @xmath11 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "we will discuss the local symmetries of the present model and an explicit gauge fixing for the linear perturbations in subsections [ local - symmetries ] and [ gauge - fixing ] .",
    "the eoms that follow from the variation of the action @xmath52 are : r^mn - g^mnr&= & \\{e^/2(f^m_pf^np - g^mnf^2)+ ^m^n .",

    "we will also assume @xmath74 to lie in the cartan subalgebra of lie@xmath75 .",
    "one of the simplest models that can be described by this set up is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model @xcite , where we have @xmath76 , @xmath49 and @xmath77 and the internal space is @xmath78 with two branes on the fixed points of @xmath79 , say at @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "indeed , as to be expected , if we include the gravitational backreaction of the branes ( @xmath197 ) then there are singular contributions to the dynamics of both the bulk gravitational fluctuations and the branons .    first , concerning the bulk gravitational fluctuations , we encounter localized contributions to the mass terms in both the spin-1 ( see eq .",

    "taking into account both the backreaction of the brane and its dynamical fluctuations , it seems necessary to resolve the thin structure of the brane .",
    "otherwise we can assume a brane tension much smaller than the 6d fundamental scale , so that its backreaction is negligible . or we can assume a high brane tension so that the brane is very heavy and rigid and does not oscillate .",
    "or else we can assume an additional orbifold symmetry under which the branons are projected out  an example of such a symmetry has been provided in ref .",

    "we can also now suggest the following . the power - law warping present in the 6d braneworlds studied here does not change qualitatively the physics",
    "moreover , models with only positive tension codimension - two branes also have qualitatively the same behaviour as traditional kk compactifications .",
    "meanwhile , the introduction of negative tension codimension - two branes can lead to surprising dynamics .",
    "as yet another example of how the physics of braneworlds in 6d can counter intuition , we have found  for special saddle - sphere compactifications with deficit angles @xmath223  three massless vector fields thanks to the presence of three @xmath4 killing vectors in the internal manifold that are well defined everywhere outside the branes .",
    "thus we see that infinitesimal isometries are sufficient to imply massless vector fields , even if they can not be integrated to genuine isometries .",

    "we finally analyse the ( massive ) spin-0 fluctuations in 6d braneworlds by using the general spin-0 action given in appendix [ lcg - xi ] . here",
    "we discard the branons .",
    "there are different ways to make this truncation consistently , _",
    "e.g. _ by introducing an orbifold that projects them out . in ref .",
    "@xcite such an orbifold has been defined taking into account the presence of at least two patches in the description of spherical topologies .",
    "here we only use the fact that the orbifold action in the intersection of the two patches is @xmath228 . in the absence of the branons",
    "the @xmath199 singularities mentioned in subsection [ spin-0-action ] obviously disappear .",
    "we shall see that it is also possible to deal with the other type of singularities mentioned there and extract a finite spectrum .    here",
    "we focus on the unwarped solutions and in particular on the rugbyballs and saddle - spheres defined in subsection [ eom ] . in this case",
    "we will be able to generalize the harmonic analysis developed in subsection [ 6d - brane-1 ] to the spin-0 sector , which involves 2d tensors as well as 2d vectors and scalars .",
    "this technique allows us to transform complicated coupled differential equations into algebraic equations whose solutions can be found exactly .",
    "the relevant fluctuations are @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath175 , @xmath173 and @xmath231 , where @xmath232 and @xmath233 run over @xmath234 and @xmath212 .",
    "we observe that the fluctuations @xmath235 orthogonal to background gauge field decouple to the other fields and have already been analyzed in @xcite ; therefore here we assume @xmath235 to be parallel to the background gauge field .",
    "one should keep in mind that , if the branons are projected out by the above - mentioned orbifold , only the modes with @xmath213 even survive ( in the fourier expansion over @xmath236 ) .",
    "the spin-0 action in the light cone gauge assumes the following form : s^(0)(h , h ) & = & - d^6x , + s^(0)(v , v)&=&-d^6x , + s^(0)(,)&=&d^6x , + s^(0)(v_2,v_2 ) & = & d^6x , + s^(0)(h , v)&= & d^6x , + s^(0)(h , ) & = & d^6x f^2 h_m^m , + s^(0)(v,)&= & d^6x f^mn(v_m;n -v_n;m ) , + s^(0)(v , v_2 ) & = & -d^6x v_mnf^mnv_l^;l , [ spin-0-lc ] where we have used the light cone gauge relation @xmath237 in @xmath238 and the property @xmath239 in @xmath227 and @xmath240 , which is a consequence of ( [ spin-1-system ] ) .",
    "we now want to use a technique similar to that explained in the spin-1 sector , in order to transform the above differential problem into an algebraic one .",
    "note that the method provided in subsection [ 6d - brane-1 ] can be already applied to perform this transformation in the terms @xmath227 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 as they only involve 2d scalars and 2d vectors - eoms shows that @xmath245 is a 2d scalar . ] . what we have done there is to identify appropriate mass - squared operators from the diagonal part of the bilinear action , which are hermitian once the hcs are imposed . in this way we were able to define complete sets of 2d scalar and vector harmonics .",
    "then we focused on the cases in which the derivative relation , eq .",
    "( [ derivrel ] ) , between scalar and vector harmonics holds .",
    "that relation is what allowed us to deal with the derivative couplings between scalars and vectors and transform the spin-1 differential problem into an algebraic one , which could easily be solved .",
    "here we generalize the above procedure to include the 2d tensor fluctuations in @xmath229 .",
    "indeed , @xmath229 can be decomposed into its trace , @xmath246 , and traceless part , @xmath247 , so that the first entry in ( [ spin-0-lc ] ) decomposes into the two terms : s^(0)(h_m^m , h_m^m ) & = & d^6x , + s^(0)(h_mn , h_mn ) & = & d^6x , where we used the following identities : r_pmqn=(g_pqg_mn - g_mqg_pn ) , f_lm f_hn= ( g_lh g_mn - g_mhg_ln ) .",
    "observe that @xmath248 is in fact a 2d scalar field , and we can expand it in terms of the 2d scalar harmonics found in subsection [ 6dbraneworlds ] .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath249 are instead genuine 2d tensor fluctuations , and the appropriate mass - squared operator is @xmath250 .",
    "thus , we would like to solve the eigenproblem : ( -d^2+r)_mn=_^2 _ mn , [ htildeeoms ] with the given ncs and hcs , where @xmath251 are the corresponding mass - eigenvalues .    in a general basis ,",
    "( [ htildeeoms ] ) is a set of two coupled differential equations ( the traceless property removes one out of the three components of a rank two symmetric tensor in two dimensions ) .",
    "however , by writing down eq .",
    "( [ htildeeoms ] ) in the @xmath252 basis defined in ( [ pm ] ) : ( -d^2 + r ) h_=_^2 h _ , [ htildeeoms2 ] where we used @xmath253 , and by explicitly evaluating @xmath254 , one finds that the equations for @xmath255 and @xmath256 are decoupled , like those of the @xmath257 and @xmath258 fields in the spin-1 sector . after a long but straightforward calculation we find -_^2 f^ + _ f^ + ( * m*^2e^-b2*m * e^-b/2 + - ) f^ = _ ^2 f^,[++eom ] where a dot represents a derivative with respect to @xmath234 and @xmath259 is the wave function of @xmath260 , defined by a kk expansion h_(x)=_*n*,*m*h_*nm*(x ) f^ _ * nm*()e^i * m * , * m*= and in ( [ + + eom ] ) the kk numbers @xmath214 and @xmath213 are understood .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath251 can be found by using the technique discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : one can put the equations into the hypergeometric form , consider the general solution to the hypergeometric equation and then impose the hcs and ncs .",
    "we find        we now remember that , in the spin-1 sector analysed in subsection [ 6d - brane-1 ] , one can generate the 2d vector harmonics by acting with derivatives over the 2d scalar harmonics ( see eq .",
    "( [ derivrel ] ) and the discussion right above ) .",
    "we can imagine that something similar happens here and the 2d tensor harmonics ( [ htildeeoms2 ] ) can be generated by acting with derivatives over 2d vector harmonics .",
    "this is indeed the case and in order to see it let us consider the 2d vector harmonics for @xmath235 : ( -d^2+)v_m = _ ^2 v_m,[vmeom ] where @xmath264 are the 2d vector mass - eigenvalues . from now on we shall assume condition ( [ validity ] ) , so that @xmath265 , with @xmath266 the 2d scalar mass - eigenvalues given in ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "after some manipulation it is easy to show that if @xmath235 satisfies the previous equation then we also have -d^2_m;n + r(_m;n+_n;m)+ ( r_;mv_n + r_;n v_m - g_mn r_;lv^l)=^2 _ m;n , [ v;mn1 ] where @xmath267 .",
    "this equation is valid for any unwarped compactification , but in the rugbyball case it can be simplified .",
    "although the ricci scalar is not constant everywhere like in the sphere limit as it contains delta - functions , these additional delta function terms can be discarded in eq .",
    "( [ v;mn1 ] ) because they are dominated by stronger singularities , which emerge from @xmath268 .",
    "this allows us to write ( [ v;mn1 ] ) as follows : -d^2_m;n + r_s(_m;n+_n;m)= ^2 _ m;n , where @xmath269 is the ricci scalar of the sphere ( @xmath270 ) , or , in the @xmath252 basis , ( -d^2 + 2r_s ) v_;= ^2 v_;,[v;mn2]where we used @xmath271 .",
    "now , comparing the eigenproblems for @xmath272 and @xmath273 , eqs .",

    "this result is in agreement with that obtained by using the wigner functions @xcite .",

    "it remains to expand the 6d fields in the action ( [ spin-0-lc ] ) into their harmonics on the rugbyball and integrate over the extra dimensions .",
    "thanks to the derivative relations ( [ derivrel],[derivrel2 ] ) , and @xmath284 , the mass - squared operator reduces to an algebraic matrix with constant entries , which can easily be diagonalized .",

    "<S> our main objective is to study how braneworld models of higher codimension differ from the 5d case and traditional kaluza - klein compactifications . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive the classical dynamics describing the physical fluctuations in a wide class of models incorporating gravity , non - abelian gauge fields , the dilaton and two - form potential , as well as 3-brane sources . </S>",
    "<S> next , we use these results to study braneworld compactifications in 6d supergravity , focusing on the bosonic fields in the minimal model ; composed of the supergravity - tensor multiplet and the @xmath0 gauge multiplet whose flux supports the compactification . for unwarped models sourced by positive tension branes , </S>",
    "<S> a harmonic analysis allows us to solve the large , coupled , differential system completely and obtain the full 4d spin-2,1 and 0 particle spectra , establishing ( marginal ) stability and a qualitative behaviour similar to the smooth sphere compactification . </S>",
    "<S> we also find interesting results for models with negative tension branes ; extra massless kaluza - klein vector fields can appear in the spectra , beyond those expected from the isometries in the internal space . </S>",
    "<S> these fields imply an enhanced gauge symmetry in the low energy 4d effective theory obtained by truncating to the massless sector , which is explicitly broken as higher modes are excited , until the full 6d symmetries are restored far above the kaluza - klein scale . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the low energy effective theory does not seem to distinguish between a compactification on a smooth sphere and these singular , deformed spheres .    </S>",
