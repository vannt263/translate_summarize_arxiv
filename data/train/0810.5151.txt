    "dissipation of stellar tides and oscillations is often considered to be mainly due to the turbulent flow in their convective zones .",
    "usually the effects of the turbulent flow are parametrized by some sort of effective viscosity coefficient .",
    "clearly the situation is not as simple as that and the usual `` fix '' is to allow this viscosity coefficient to depend on the perturbation being dissipated , most notably its frequency and perhaps direction of the shear it creates .",
    "completely analytical treatments start by assuming a kolmogorov spectrum for the turbulent flow and combine it with some prescription for the effectiveness of eddies in dissipating perturbations of the given period . since kolmogorov turbulence is isotropic the direction of shear is unimportant in such prescriptions .",
    "two such prescriptions have been used .",
    "the first , proposed by @xcite , states that when the period of the perturbation ( @xmath0 ) is shorter than the turnover times ( @xmath1 ) of some eddies , their dissipation efficiency should be proportional to the fraction of a churn they manage to complete in half a perturbation period , in other words , the effective viscosity coefficient scales like : @xmath2.\\ ] ]    the second prescription is due to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they argue that eddies with turnover times much bigger than the period of the perturbation will not contribute appreciably to the dissipation , and hence the effective viscosity should be dominated by the largest eddies with turnover times @xmath3 .",
    "then the kolmogorov prescription of turbulence predicts that the effective viscosity will scale as : @xmath4\\ ] ]    zahn s prescription has been tested against tidal circularization times for binaries containing a giant star @xcite , and is in general agreement with observations .",
    "also zahn s prescription is in better agreement with observed tidal dissipation of binary stars in clusters @xcite and with the location of the red edge of the cepheid instability strip @xcite .",
    "the less efficient prescription has been used successfully by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to develop a theory for the damping of the solar @xmath5-modes . in this case",
    "the more effective dissipation would require dramatic changes in the excitation mechanism in order to explain the observed amplitudes .",
    "finally @xcite developed a perturbative derivation of the convective viscosity , which for a kolmogorov scaling , gives a result that is closer to the less efficient goldreich & nicholson viscosity than it is to zahn s . while providing a firmer theoretical basis for the former scaling",
    ", this does not resolve the observational problem of insufficient tidal dissipation .",
    "the development of 2d and 3d simulations of solar convection hint at a possible resolution of this problem .",
    "the convective flow that these simulations predict is fundamentally very different from the assumed kolmogorov turbulence @xcite .",
    "the first major difference is that the frequency power spectrum of the velocity field is much flatter than the kolmogorov power spectrum , and hence one might expect that the dissipation will decrease significantly slower as frequency increases relative to the kolmogorov case .",
    "another major difference is that the velocity field is no longer isotropic and hence one would expect it to react differently to shear in different directions . that is , if we would use an effective viscosity coefficient , it should be a tensor and not a scalar quantity .",
    "as a first step in investigating that possibility @xcite , we applied the perturbative approach developed by @xcite to a numerical model of solar convection ( robinson et al .",
    "2003 ) to find the scaling of the components of the effective viscosity tensor with frequency .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , we found that the scaling closely follows zahn s prescription , even though when the same approach is applied to kolmogorov turbulence it gives results closer to those of goldreich and collaborators .    that left a lot of questions unanswered .",
    "for example , are the effects of turbulence anything at all like that of molecular viscosity , and is taking only the lowest order term in a power series expansion of the energy dissipation rate an acceptable approximation ?",
    "the perturbative approach also assumes that the spatial scale of the external shear being dissipated is large compared to all convective scales , and hence can be assumed a linear function of position , but it would be interesting to see how quickly dissipation efficiency is lost as the spatial scale of the external shear decreases .    to tackle these questions we adapted the anelastic spectral code of @xcite to simulate a convectively unstable box in which we are able to place external , time dependent shear as part of the evolution equations and observe the effects of the turbulent convective flow directly .    in order to make the code suitable to simulate convection we added heat diffusion , that allows for the supply the heat that will drive the convective motions",
    "this in turn necessitated that we allow for a more general background state slightly modified treatment of the pressure and the introduction of temperature boundary conditions .",
    "in addition we added an external forcing term and removed the kepplerian shear and the accompanying it shearing coordinates .",
    "the resulting code is ideal for our purposes for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "the anelastic approximation means no shock or sound waves can exist and hence the time steps can be much larger than for a fully compressible code , and yet the anelastic approximation allows phenomena such as convection to occur unlike in completely incompressible codes .",
    "this allows us to get much closer to the actual time scales of interest ( usually of order hours or days ) than a fully compressible code would .",
    "the boussinesq approximation has those same properties , however it is not suitable for simulating stratified convection where the buoyancy does not depend entirely on the temperature .",
    "spectral codes are more efficient at simulating turbulent flows than finite difference codes because their spatial accuracy is exponential rather than a power law , so they are capable of reliably reproducing the turbulent flow even at modest resolution",
    ". 3 .   the grid happens to have higher density near the top and bottom of the box where it is needed in order to resolve the boundary layers that develop there due to the boundary conditions we impose .",
    "in this paper we present the details of the modified code as well as a perturbative estimate of the efficiency of turbulent viscosity . in section",
    "[ sec : equations ] we derive the anelastic approximation to the navier - stokes equations modified to include a time dependent shear . in section [ sec : numerics ] we present the numerical algorithm . in section",
    "[ sec : tests ] we show the tests we ran to confirm that our implementation actually evolves the desired equations , and verify that the numerical scheme is indeed second - order accurate in time .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : results ] we use a perturbative calculation to get an estimate of the effective turbulent viscosity in our simulated box .",
    "we define upfront the following quantities describing the fluid and the flow :        what we pre - compute and store is a matrix @xmath7 , which we obtain by overwriting the first and last row of @xmath8 with : @xmath9 to allow for imposing the boundary conditions , then sandwiching the resulting matrix between @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12    then in order to solve equations [ eq : heat diff ] and [ eq : heat diff bc ] for each horizontal mode we construct a new matrix @xmath13 from @xmath7 as follows : @xmath14 the first new term adds the horizontal part of the @xmath15 operator for the given mode .",
    "however , this breaks the requirements for the boundary conditions , so we repair them with the other two terms . this way the boundary conditions are directly imposed by breaking equation [ eq : heat diff ] at the physical top and bottom of the box , instead of ignoring it for the two highest chebyshev modes .",
    "that means we do not need to perform extra greens steps like we did for the pressure equation .",
    "then we obtain the solution to equation [ eq : heat diff ] by decomposing @xmath13 into an upper and lower triangular matrices and using back - substitution ."
