    "the dbi action is written compactly as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the volume of the space where the ym theory lives .",
    "we set @xmath30 in this paper and all the extensive quantities should be understood as those per unit volume .",
    "there are two big categories of the d7-brane solutions ( embeddings ) in the present setup : minkowski embeddings and black - hole embeddings .",
    "the minkowski embeddings are the d7-brane configurations which do not touch the black - hole horizon , and the black - hole embeddings are those connected to the black - hole horizon .",
    "let us define the two foregoing embeddings by using the bulk coordinate .",
    "@xmath31 on the d7-brane worldvolume starts at a particular value at the boundary ( which we define @xmath32 ) and one finds that it decreases monotonically as @xmath15 decreases .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath33 ( which we define @xmath34 ) is realized at the minimum @xmath15 ( which is denoted by @xmath35 ) .",
    "since the location of the horizon is where @xmath36 , the brane touches the horizon at @xmath37 if @xmath38 .",
    "this defines the black - hole embeddings .",
    "the minkowski embeddings are those with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a further detailed classification of the brane embeddings is given in appendix [ structure - can ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath41 , which is the asymptotic value of @xmath33 is a parameter of the theory which describes the current quark mass @xmath42 .",
    "the relationship between the mass and @xmath41 is given by @xmath43 since we usually fix the current quark mass and the t hooft coupling in the analysis , @xmath44 is equivalent to the temperature up to a proportional constant .",

    "the ym - theory lagrangian corresponds to switching on a one - form bulk field @xmath51 that has the following asymptotic behaviour : @xmath52 where @xmath53 for the one - form field and @xmath54 is a constant which will be determined later .",
    "@xmath55 is the conformal dimension of the operator @xmath56 that is 3 in this case .    in the ym - theory side , @xmath0-charge chemical potential @xmath57 in the grand - canonical ensemble",
    "is introduced by adding an operator @xmath58 to the euclidean ym lagrangian . here",
    ", @xmath59 is the quark - charge chemical potential and we may use @xmath60 rather than @xmath57 when it is convenient .",
    "what we need to do first in the gravity dual is to find an appropriate one - form field @xmath51 .",
    "a proposal given in refs .",
    "@xcite is that @xmath51 is the @xmath1 gauge field @xmath61 on the flavor d - branes .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry is the @xmath1-diagonal part of the global flavor symmetry in the ym side .",
    "an important fact is that the global flavor symmetry is promoted to a _ gauge _ symmetry on the flavor branes in the gravity dual .",
    "for example , the global @xmath62 symmetry in the @xmath2 sym theory is realized as @xmath62 gauge symmetry on the flavor d7-branes .",
    "hence the @xmath0 symmetry corresponds to the @xmath1 gauge symmetry on the flavor brane , and the @xmath0 charge is identified as the @xmath1 `` electric '' charge on the brane in terms of the gravity dual .",
    "then it is quite natural to infer that the chemical potential conjugate to the @xmath0 charge is given by the boundary value of @xmath63 that is the conjugate field to the `` electric '' charge : @xmath64 here , we have normalized the unit electric charge so that it has the unit quark - number charge ( that is @xmath65 times the unit baryon - number charge ) rather than the unit baryon - number charge .",
    "this normalization comes from the fact that a quark is represented by a single fundamental string , and the end point of the fundamental string carries unit electric charge with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "now , a problem comes up at ( [ dictio-2 ] ) ; @xmath63 is not a gauge invariant quantity in the bulk theory while @xmath60 and @xmath48 in the right - hand side are physical quantities .",
    "we will provide a gauge - invariant definition of the quark / baryon - charge chemical potential in the next subsection .      in this section",
    ", we construct a gauge - invariant formulation of the @xmath0-charge chemical potential in ads / cft .",
    "a gauge - invariant definition of the chemical potential has already been introduced in refs .",
    "however , the aim of this section is to present a mathematically consistent framework by showing how the manifestly gauge - invariant formulation is obtained starting with the standard ads / cft dictionary ( [ dictio-2 ] ) .      in the grand - canonical ensemble , the grand potential can be evaluated from an on - shell euclidean bulk lagrangian obtained by fixing the chemical potential at a given value .",
    "let us begin with a bulk lagrangian given by @xmath66 where we have explicitly introduced a lagrange multiplier , denoted by @xmath47 , that defines the chemical potential .",
    "we omit the lagrangian of the bulk gravity , since it is independent of the @xmath0-charge under the probe approximation .",
    "( [ bulk - action ] ) can be re - written in a way that makes its ads / cft antecedents explicit : @xmath67 the last term is the usual bulk - boundary coupling in ads / cft which directly allows us to interpret @xmath47 as the conserved @xmath68 charge of the field theory .",
    "the first two terms then may be viewed as the lagrangian of the d7-branes with a charged source at @xmath35 .",
    "we note that in the present background ( with the only gauge field present being @xmath69 ) , the d7-brane lagrangian does not have a coupling of the form @xmath70 ; thus latter term must be due to some other dynamical object .",
    "we will discuss the nature of the source term later .",
    "the third term is understood in the following way . in field theory , the grand - canonical partition function is defined as @xmath71=\\int d\\phi \\ : dq \\exp[-\\beta ( l-\\mu q)],\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the charge and @xmath72 denotes the fields whose lagrangian is @xmath41 .",
    "the third term in the bulk action then corresponds to the field theoretic term @xmath73 which is present in the grand - canonical ensemble .    in the grand - canonical ensemble ,",
    "the amount of the charge fluctuates and its expectation value may be determined ( approximately ) by the saddle point value of the partition function . in bulk terms , this is equivalent to determining the value of @xmath47 by minimizing the bulk action ( [ bulk - action ] ) at the given chemical potential .",
    "thus , the saddle - point value ( the on - shell value ) of the bulk action is identified with the grand - potential of the dual field theory .",
    "note that , in the usual ads / cft correspondence , field theory quantities are defined by boundary values of bulk fields .",
    "our definition of the chemical potential in ( [ bulk - action ] ) is however @xmath74 to understand how this can be the case , it is worthwhile recalling how the grand potential in the r - charged system has been computed in terms of gravity dual . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the grand potential is identified with the on - shell value of the einstein - maxwell - anti - desitter effective lagrangian in the bulk computed by solving the equations of motion with the boundary value of the time component of the vector potential kept fixed .",
    "this matches the picture that the control parameter of the grand - canonical ensemble , the r - charge chemical potential in this case , is given by the boundary value of the potential .",
    "let us start with a slightly different bulk action by following this spirit : @xmath75 in this action , we have a source of strength @xmath47 at @xmath35 , while the chemical potential has been defined to be the boundary value of the bulk gauge field using a lagrange multiplier @xmath76 ; our ads / cft dictionary is ( [ dictio-2 ] ) at this stage . however , demanding gauge invariance forces @xmath77 .",
    "then , extremizing over @xmath76 leads us to the definition of chemical potential as in ( [ chem - def ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we first extremize over @xmath76 , then it is easily seen that the chemical potential is obtained as the asymptotic value of @xmath78 , which in turn is obtained by solving the equations of motion of the gauge field in the presence of a charged source @xmath47 at @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath79 is then obtained as a consequence of flux conservation .",
    "the difference , of course , is that it is only in the first case that we have off - shell gauge invariance . in the grand - canonical ensemble ,",
    "since the charge q fluctuates , the off - shell gauge invariance is required .",
    "thus we must first impose gauss law and then extremize over the lagrange multiplier .",
    "this explains how , starting from the standard ads / cft prescription , we arrive at the definition ( [ chem - def ] ) .    indeed , the definition of the chemical potential ( [ chem - def ] ) is consistent with that in ref .",
    "@xcite since @xmath80 is set to be zero there .",
    "one interesting observation is that the right - hand side of ( [ chem - def ] ) is nothing but a work necessary to bring a unit charge from the boundary to @xmath35 against the electric field @xmath81 along the worldvolume of the d7-brane",
    ". it would be interesting if we can connect this picture to some physical process in the ym theory .",
    "now the dictionary ( [ dictio-2 ] ) is modified to be @xmath82 this new recipe also matches the standard computation of the grand potential in thermal field theories .",
    "let us rewrite @xmath83 to be @xmath84 where @xmath85 + q\\left\\{a_{0}(\\infty)-a_{0}(\\rho_{min})\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the grand potential is the on - shell value of @xmath86 obtained by solving the equations of motion of the fields and @xmath47 .",
    "this is nothing but the standard computational recipe of the grand potential if we regard @xmath87 corresponds to the effective lagrangian of the field theory .",
    "indeed , @xmath87 is more consistent than @xmath88 as a d7-brane lagrangian since the conservation of the electric flux is manifest .    in summary ,",
    "the grand potential is determined by the following steps in the gravity dual :    1 .",
    "we start with @xmath83 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath60 is our input parameter .",
    "2 .   we solve the equations of motion .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath63 is given by our input @xmath60 through @xmath89 that comes from equation of motion of @xmath47 .",
    "the on - shell value of @xmath83 ( see appendix [ regularization ] for the renormalization ) gives the grand potential ( density ) @xmath90 of the flavor part .",
    "the on - shell value of @xmath47 is the thermal expectation value of the quark - charge density .",
    "we employ this gauge - invariant formulation of the chemical potential in the present paper , and we choose @xmath91 gauge in the remaining part .",
    "a connection between the equations of motion and a thermodynamic relation can also be seen in the following way .",
    "the equations of motion of @xmath63 from ( [ bulk - action ] ) are @xmath92 solving the differential equation ( [ eom1 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ bound - cond-1 ] ) and ( [ bound - cond-2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath93 which suggests @xmath94 .",
    "since @xmath47 does not depend on @xmath15 , we have @xmath95 which is equivalent to the thermodynamic relation @xmath96 here we have used the definition of the chemical potential ( [ chem - def ] ) and the fact that the on - shell value of @xmath83 is given by that of @xmath97 .",
    "it is interesting that the gauss - law constraint ( [ gauss ] ) in the `` electro - magnetism '' on the flavor brane corresponds to the thermodynamic relation ( [ thermo - rel ] ) in the ym theory .    the coefficient @xmath54 in ( [ dictio ] )",
    "can also be determined by the boundary condition ( [ bound - cond-1 ] ) . substituting the asymptotic expansions ( [ dictio - inv ] ) and @xmath98 , @xmath99 to make the foregoing expression to be consistent with our identification @xmath100 , @xmath54 is determined to be @xmath101",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath102 per unit volume is obtained by the legendre transformation @xmath103 .",
    "this is nothing but a procedure to obtain an _ on - shell _ `` hamiltonian '' ( if we regard @xmath15 as a `` time '' formally ) in terms of the d7-brane dynamics : @xmath104_{on - shell}. \\label{legendre}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here in the right - hand side , @xmath105 is interpreted as the `` conjugate momentum '' of @xmath63 by ( [ gauss ] ) , and all the quantities in ( [ legendre ] ) are the on - shell values .",
    "then , we can make the following recipe in the _",
    "canonical ensemble_.    1 .",
    "we define the hamiltonian @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are not necessarily at on - shell , but the gauss - law constraint ( [ gauss ] ) is imposed to eliminate the electric field in favor of @xmath47 .",
    "now our input parameter is @xmath47 but not @xmath60 .",
    "2 .   we solve the equations of motion to find the on - shell value of @xmath107 which gives @xmath102 .",
    "the thermal expectation value of @xmath60 is given by @xmath109 , where @xmath81 is obtained from the gauss - law constraint ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for our system is explicitly given by @xmath110 the equation of motion after eliminating the gauge field is written explicitly by @xmath111 and the gauss - law constraint in the explicit form is @xmath112 notice that @xmath113 can be regarded as an effective tension of the d7-branes which is affected by the presence of the gauge field . in particular , the effective tension becomes larger if the charge increase , and the brane is attracted to the black - hole more strongly . therefore if we keep the current quark mass fixed , the minimum `` height '' @xmath34 of the d7-brane decreases as we increase the charge density .",
    "it may be useful to define @xmath114 since both @xmath113 and ( [ f - tilde ] ) are written in terms of @xmath115 .",
    "we may use @xmath115 as a parameter of the system in the canonical ensemble in the later analysis if it is convenient .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to make a few comments .",
    "the gauss - law constraint in the form of ( [ f - tilde ] ) gives a relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath47 : an equation of state .",
    "equation ( [ f - tilde ] ) itself can be used both in the grand - canonical ensemble and the canonical ensemble .",
    "we should be careful only in the interpretation of the variables : in the ( grand- ) canonical ensemble , @xmath60 ( @xmath47 ) obtained from ( [ f - tilde ] ) is the thermal expectation value while @xmath47 ( @xmath60 ) is the control parameter of the theory .",
    "another comment is about the framework presented in ref .",
    "there is a `` quick '' computational method based on our formalism .",
    "since the on - shell value of @xmath83 is the same as that of @xmath88 , the correct grand potential is also obtained by starting with @xmath88 alone , and solving the equations of motion by imposing the gauss - law constraint @xmath116 by hand .",
    "this is nothing but the computational method employed in ref .",
    "this means that ref .",
    "@xcite produces the results of the present framework .",
    "the last comment is about the consistency of the present formalism .",
    "we would like to stress that the charged source whose necessity is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite has already been introduced at the stage of ( [ d7+source ] ) .",
    "thus , there is no need for introducing any further sources , and all equations are correctly satisfied .",
    "now , we would like to bring our attention to the claim presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out the necessity of the charged source at @xmath117 , and they provided it by adding @xmath0-charge carrying objects to the system . their idea is to put fundamental strings ( f1 s ) between the d7-branes and the black - hole horizon , that are interpreted as quarks .",
    "then , they found that the minkowski embeddings in ref .",
    "@xcite are unstable due to the tension of the f1 s and there is no way to keep the d7-branes off the horizon .",
    "this is why the minkowski embeddings at finite baryon - number density are concluded to be unphysical in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , one should notice that this is not what we are doing in the present paper .",
    "the necessary charged source term has been introduced as an _ external _ source to the d7-brane dbi theory at ( [ d7+source ] ) and we have not added any corresponding nambu - goto action of the f1 there .",
    "this means the system we are dealing with is something different from that in ref .",
    "since we have not introduced the additional f1 s , we expect that in the present framework , the minkowski embeddings are physical as well .    in this section , we will show that it is indeed the case .",
    "we will present numerical results , @xmath118 so that @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the numerical analysis .",

    "a physical interpretation of our setup will be proposed in section [ discussion ] .      in order to show a consistency of our framework",

    "( we may use @xmath123 as the meaning of @xmath60 . )",
    "let us present basic explanations on the @xmath123-@xmath47 diagram in this subsection as preparation .",
    "an example of the @xmath123-@xmath47 diagram is given at fig .",
    "[ fig : ptq01 ] ( or at fig .",
    "[ fig : ptm01 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the d7-brane solutions that belong to the minkowski embeddings start from @xmath124 ( which is the origin of the plane ) and go through @xmath125 and @xmath126 until @xmath127 where the line meets the vertical axes .",
    "the black - hole embeddings exactly start from @xmath127 where the minkowski embeddings terminate , and go through @xmath128 , @xmath102 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and extend to the large-@xmath47 and large-@xmath123 region .",

    "[ fig : am01 ] show the relationship between the helmholtz free energy density and @xmath47 , and that between the grand potential density and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "although the thermodynamic potentials obtained from all the possible solutions are indicated , what we should take is the line which has the minimum value .",
    "then , we find first - order phase transitions .",
    "let us see fig .",
    "[ fig : am01 ] , for example .",
    "the phase transition is a jump between a minkowski embedding and a black - hole embedding at the critical chemical potential @xmath132 . since the grand potentials in both embeddings have the same values at @xmath132 , the integral @xmath133 below @xmath132 and that above @xmath132 have to be same because the integrals compute @xmath134 by virtue of @xmath135 .",
    "this is the maxwell construction .",
    "one can see that the maxwell construction works in a non - trivial way in good accuracy in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptm01 ] . we have checked numerically that the area of the shaded regions marked `` @xmath136 '' agrees with the area of the regions with `` @xmath137 '' , due to a non - trivial collaboration of the minkowski and the black - hole embeddings .",
    "we can also see that the maxwell construction works in the canonical ensemble in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptq01 ] , again by virtue of the collaboration of the two types of the embeddings .",
    "now , we are ready to make some important comments based on the numerical results . fig .",
    "[ fig : muq ] shows that how the @xmath123-@xmath47 diagram is deformed if we make the temperature lower .",
    "the temperature goes down as we move from fig .",
    "[ fig : muq01 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : muq04 ] .",
    "an important feature is that the cusp @xmath130 located at the origin on fig .",
    "[ fig : muq01 ] `` goes up '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : muq02 ] ) and disappears ( fig .",
    "[ fig : muq03 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : muq04 ] ) along the cooling process .",
    "the cusp on fig .",
    "[ fig : muq02 ] gives the minimum value of the chemical potential within the black - hole embeddings .",
    "this means that the low - chemical - potential region disappears from the parameter space of the theory at the sufficiently low temperature if we abandon the minkowski embeddings .",
    "we can also interpret the behaviour of the diagram in a different way .",
    "suppose that we are in the grand - canonical ensemble and we examine a process in which we vary the temperature with maintaining the chemical potential .",
    "then , we encounter a problem that there is no low - temperature region in our parameter space at sufficiently small chemical potential .    the lack of the low - temperature region can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ mubranch ] , where the d7-brane solutions on the @xmath41-@xmath138 plane are given .",
    "the minkowski embeddings ( @xmath39 ) and the black - hole embeddings ( @xmath139 ) are connected at @xmath140 there .",
    "notice that all the temperature region is covered by using the two types of embeddings .",
    "however , if we abandon the minkowski embeddings , the theory can not cover the low - temperature region .",
    "( recall that @xmath141 . )",
    "we can conclude from the above that if we abandon the minwkowski embeddings , the low - temperature and the low - chemical - potential region in the grand - canonical ensemble does not exist in the formalism ; we have no way to introduce the flavor degree of freedom in that region .",
    "this is an incomplete - ness of the formalism . on the other hand ,",
    "if we include the minkowski embeddings together with the black - hole embeddings , all the parameter region of the theory is covered in harmony of the two types of embeddings .",

    "@xcite with our formalism ?",
    "the purpose of this section is to present one possible physical interpretation of our framework , and to clarify the difference between our system and that of ref .",
    "@xcite .    to this end , let us consider the lagrangian @xmath164 the second term which is the source term does not arise from any known coupling of the d7-brane ( in this background ) .",
    "the remaining terms however , can be argued for , from the standard ads / cft correspondence ( as was done earlier ) .",
    "thus , one is forced to regard the second term as coming from a charged object which intersects the d7-brane at @xmath35 .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite have asked what is the physical object carrying the @xmath0-charge in the gravity - dual side .",
    "their proposal is that this object is a fundamental string connecting the d7-branes and the black - hole horizon which corresponds to a single quark in the ym theory .",
    "hence they added the fundamental strings ( f1 s ) further to the system .    the bulk action for the system in ref .",
    "@xcite in our language is then , @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the nambu - goto lagrangian of the f1 , and @xmath167 represents the contribution of the bundle of the f1 s that are homogeneously distributed in the three - dimensional space with number density @xmath47 @xcite . in this picture , the second term in ( [ action - prelim-2 ] ) is induced by the end points of the f1 s on the d7-branes .",
    "now the equations of motion of the system will be modified because of @xmath167 .",
    "in particular , the effect of the tension of the bundle of the f1 s has to be taken into account ( this force balance condition may be regarded as arising from the surface terms in the equations of motion ) .    the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the bundle s tension is always strong enough to pull down the d7-branes to the horizon , and we have only black - hole embeddings if we start from ( [ kmmmt - action ] ) .",
    "however , this is clearly different from what we are doing in this paper . since the nambu - goto lagrangian is absent from our action ( [ action - prelim-2 ] ) ,",
    "there is no force - balance problem between the d7-branes and the f1 s , and there is no reason to abandon the minkowski embeddings _ a priori _ in our framework .",
    "then what is the physical interpretation of our setup ? let us look into ( [ kmmmt - action ] ) in more details to clarify the physical interpretation .    if we start from ( [ kmmmt - action ] ) and carry out constructing the formalism ( by regarding @xmath47 as a legendre multiplier )",
    ", the definition of the chemical potential will be modified to @xmath168 the mass of the f1 ( which is defined to be @xmath166 here ) is now included in the definition of the chemical potential .    here",
    "we should notice that we could have added baryons instead of quarks to the system a la ref .",

    "we should also add the `` baryon - vertex lagrangian '' ( d5-brane dbi lagrangian and nambu - goto lagrangians of the fundamental strings that constitute the baryon vertex ) to ( [ action - prelim-2 ] ) instead of the f1 s nambu - goto lagrangian : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the lagrangian of the baryon vertex .",
    "now the definition of the chemical potential will be modified to be @xmath172 . however , this is not what we are doing , either .",
    "the point is that the definition of our chemical potential @xmath60 is blind to what the baryon - charge carrying object is .",
    "therefore , one natural interpretation of our formalism is that we are dealing with a system of mesons with an _ external _ @xmath0-charged source in the canonical ensemble ( and its conjugate system in the grand - canonical ensemble ) .",
    "this is why we have used an expression `` @xmath0-charge chemical potential '' rather than `` baryon chemical potential '' in this paper .",
    "this interpretation comes form the fact that the d7-brane s dbi action provides an effective action of mesons , and we have inserted only the charged source term to it in the gravity - dual side .",
    "one may wonder how to imagine the system of mesons with an external @xmath0-charged source .",
    "an intuition may be obtained by considering so - called walecka model ( or the @xmath173-@xmath174 model ) @xcite .",
    "the walecka model is a model of nucleon - meson systems .",
    "the baryon - number current couples to the @xmath174-meson through the yukawa coupling in that model .",
    "therefore , the baryon - number density ( which is charged under the @xmath0 symmetry ) can act as a source for the @xmath175 mesons there .",
    "we will not try to connect the present setup with any particular phenomenological model of the sym theory in this paper",
    ". however , our baryon - number current can couple to our mesons in the same way as it does in the walecka model , in principle .- meson field by a constant and there is no effect on the scalar mesons ( @xmath173 mesons ) because of the absence of direct @xmath173-@xmath174 coupling .",
    "however , in the present d3-d7 setup , we do have couplings between the scalar mesons and the vector mesons due to the non - linearity of the d7-brane dbi action .",
    "this is a reason why the presence of @xmath0 charge can change the shape of the d7-branes . ]",
    "let us re - interpret what we have observed based on the above interpretation .",
    "first of all , the existence of the physical minkowski embeddings is explained .",
    "since we are dealing with a system of mesons with an external @xmath0-charged source inserted , we _ need not _ to add any @xmath0-charge carrying dynamical object to the system by hand . therefore , the fundamental strings that make the minkowski embeddings to be unstable can never come into the present setup by definition . the instability of the minkowski embeddings discussed in ref . @xcite",
    "may also be interpreted in the following way .",
    "the color non - singlet quarks have been added to the phase ( minkowski branch ) where the physical mesons exists . the instability of the minkowski embeddings with f1 s may correspond to the instability of a confinement phase with color non - singlet quarks .",
    "the reason why the framework in ref .",
    "@xcite is incomplete may also be understood .",
    "if we wish to analyze the system which contains physical baryon - number charged particles , we also have to examine what happens if we add the baryon vertices instead of the f1 s to the minkowski embeddings .",
    "this analysis has not yet been done , and what we should do at this stage is to postpone the conclusion about the fate of the minkowski embeddings rather than to abandon them , until the analysis with baryons is accomplished .",
    "an argument that the charged source can be d5-branes is the following .",
    "let us imagine that we introduce charged sources keeping the d7-branes fixed .",
    "we can then compare the energies of various candidate sources .",
    "that is to say , we compare the energy of @xmath176 f1 s stretching between @xmath177 and the horizon , and the energy of a single d5-brane ( wrapping the @xmath178 ) placed at @xmath179 .",
    "we can immediately see , that if @xmath138 is sufficiently large , d5-branes are lower in energy@xcite .",
    "thus , baryons are more appropriate as charged sources for low enough temperature ( i.e. , large enough @xmath138 ) .",
    "( a related argument that d5-branes with attached fundamental strings can sit outside the horizon in the black - hole geometry for low enough temperatures has been demonstrated in @xcite ) .",
    "another candidate source is d1-branes that are transverse to the d7-branes ( i.e. , wrap the @xmath180 direction of the metric ( [ metric ] ) ) .",
    "it can be argued that the open strings from the d1-branes to the d7-branes are fermionic @xcite .",
    "further , the d1-branes can form a fuzzy @xmath178 by a version of the myers effect @xcite .",
    "indeed we have a preliminary observation of what happens if we add baryon vertices to the minkowski embeddings . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod - ft ] , the free energy densities with / without adding the d5-brane mass are shown there .",
    "[ fig : mod - phase ] shows the phase diagram in the canonical ensemble with / without adding the d5-brane mass .",
    "the d5-brane s mass is computed based on the assumption that the configuration of the d5 is spherical and it is attached to the minkowski embedding at @xmath181 without taking account of interactions between the d7-brane ( see , for the details , appendix [ baryon - mass ] ) . the correction to the black - hole embeddings is zero under this assumption since the d5-brane is on top of the horizon .",
    "this is why the line of the phase transition between the black - hole embeddings ( between the b - branch and the c - branch ) is not modified in fig .",
    "[ fig : mod - phase ] .",
    "we understand that the assumption employed here may be invalidated if we analyze the dynamics of the full system of the d5 s and the d7-branes .",
    "however , what we would like to comment from fig .",
    "[ fig : baryon - add ] is that the naive estimation of the d5-brane s energy is not too large to make the phase transition impossible ; the modified free energy of the minkowski embeddings still intersects that of the black - hole embeddings .",
    "this suggests that we have a chance to obtain a complete setup for the finite density systems of dynamical baryons , by including the baryon - vertex d5-branes in an appropriate way .",
    "notice that our estimation of the d5-brane mass qualitatively matches what is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the d5-brane mass is a decreasing function of @xmath47 since @xmath34 is .",
    "improvement of the framework in this direction is certainly an important subject .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the location of the charge on the d7-branes .",
    "we have assumed that the location of the charge on the d7-branes is @xmath117 at ( [ d7+source ] ) .",
    "however , there is a freedom in the choice of the location in principle .",
    "for example , the charge can be delocalized in the @xmath15-direction , or the position of the charge can be different from @xmath117 .",
    "if we take the picture where we have dynamical charged objects , the distribution of the charge in the @xmath15-direction may be determined by the dynamics of the d7-branes and the charge - carrying objects . however , since the charge in the this paper with the above interpretation is non - dynamical , the distribution should be given by hand in the present setup .",
    "one may wonder how to determine the location of the charge in the @xmath15-direction and what is its physical interpretation .",

    "substituting the metric ( [ adsm ] ) and the constants into ( [ mb-1 ] ) , we obtain @xcite @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the location of the baryon vertex in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath214 by using the @xmath215-coordinate .",
