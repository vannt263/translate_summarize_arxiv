    "reaction - diffusion systems and other interacting particle systems are relevant for the description of several phenomena in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite . in the past",
    ", they have been mainly modelled by ( non - linear ) partial differential equations @xcite , a description which implicitly contains a mean - field assumption .",
    "such a description is however no longer appropriate in low dimensions where fluctuations are important . to take these into account one turns to a description of the reaction - diffusion system in terms of a stochastic process",
    "this can for example be realised by adding a noise term to the partial differential equation . in recent years",
    "however , particular attention has been paid to models defined on a lattice .",
    "it has been found that these can be related to a number of interesting topics in modern statistical mechanics such as growing interfaces @xcite , phase transitions into an absorbing state @xcite , exactly solvable quantum spin chains @xcite , persistence exponents @xcite and so on .",
    "the systems which we will study here are defined on a lattice but evolve in continuous time .",
    "at each site of the lattice , one can have ( hard core ) ` particles ' which can perform a random walk and/or can undergo one or several ` reactions ' . in this paper we will limit ourselves to systems with one type of particle .",
    "each lattice site can then be either empty ( @xmath1 ) or be occupied by a particle ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "as an example , consider a system in which particles perform random walks and where two particles on neighbouring sites can ` annihilate ' ( i.e. undergo the reaction @xmath3 ) . in a simple mean field",
    "approach the density of particles @xmath4 in this system decays asymptotically as @xmath5 .",
    "it is common to introduce a critical exponent @xmath6 which describes the decay of the density ( @xmath7 ) and which therefore in mean field theory equals @xmath8 .",
    "an exact solution of the diffusion - annihilation model in @xmath0 ( where it is equivalent to the @xmath9 glauber dynamics of an ising model on the dual lattice ) shows however that @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this latter value is also found experimentally in systems which are thought to be described by the diffusion - annihilation model .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 shows a large universality across materials and initial conditions . the same value for @xmath6 is also found when the experimental situation is described more correctly by a diffusion - coagulation ( @xmath11 ) model @xcite . hence , as in the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena one needs a scheme which at the same time explains the observed universality and gives precise values for critical exponents such as @xmath6 .",
    "one is therefore naturally led to a search for renormalisation group ( rg ) approaches to stochastic systems .",
    "mathematically , the stochastic process is a continuous time markov process .",
    "using the formal equivalence between the master equation and the schrdinger equation in imaginary time , one can set up a field theoretic formulation for stochastic systems which in turn can be used in the construction of a renormalisation approach @xcite .",
    "critical exponents can then be calculated in an @xmath12-expansion around the upper critical dimension , which in this case equals @xmath13 .",
    "this approach is by now well established and has been applied to many interesting systems . as an example , we mention the much studied branching and annihilating random walks ( barw ) @xcite , where besides diffusion and annihilation , particles can undergo branching processes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the competition between annihilation and branching leads to a non - equilibrium phase transition where the stationary state particle density @xmath15 goes to zero in a continuous way as a function of the rates of the different processes . near this transition",
    ", several critical exponents ( static and dynamic ) can be introduced .",
    "it has been shown , both numerically and using the field theoretic rg , that the universality class of the transition for barw is completely determined by the parity of @xmath16 @xcite . for @xmath16 odd , the transition falls in the universality class of directed percolation , whereas for @xmath16 even a new universality class appears .",
    "on the basis of very precise simulations , jensen @xcite conjectured that @xmath17 and @xmath18 when @xmath16 is even ( @xmath19 describes the way @xmath20 goes to zero near the transition ) .",
    "so far , a precise analytical calculation of these exponents has however not been possible .",
    "menyhrd and dor propose the value @xmath21 on the basis of a perturbation around mean field theory @xcite . using a loop expansion at fixed dimension ,",
    "cardy and tuber find @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "thus , there is clearly room for the introduction of new , analytical approaches to the barw and related models .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibilities of a real space rg approach to interacting particle systems .",
    "our starting point is again the equivalence between a stochastic system and a quantum mechanical one . in the past ,",
    "several real space rg approaches to quantum lattice systems have been introduced .",
    "we must mention here as an example the _ density matrix renormalisation group _ ( dmrg ) which has been very succesful @xcite .",
    "currently , several research teams in the world are investigating the applicability of the dmrg to reaction - diffusion systems @xcite,@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the name dmrg is a bit a misnomer , since one rarely calculates rg flows in this approach and hence it is not easy to decide on questions of universality using this technique .",
    "moreover , the approach is purely numerical . instead in this work",
    ", we will use an appropriate perturbative extension of the so called standard ( also called slac ) approach @xcite .",
    "we have applied this rg method to the study of the stationary state properties of some interacting particle systems .",
    "we found that the method works surprisingly well in several cases which we studied .",
    "these include a solvable reaction diffusion model ( with diffusion , coagulation and decoagulation ) and the contact process , which is also thought to be in the directed percolation universality class .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly introduce the description of stochastic processes in a quantum mechanical language . in section iii",
    ", we discuss a real space approach to the ground state of quantum ( spin or fermion ) chains .",
    "our method is perturbative and in first order coincides with the standard ( or slac ) approach .",
    "we discuss how the technique can be derived from more conventional ( niemeijer - van leeuwen ) rg approaches to quantum lattice systems by taking the zero temperature limit .",
    "the method as such is not new but , in our opinion , not very well known .",
    "we also discuss how critical exponents for stochastic systems can be obtained from such an approach . in section iv we study properties of the stationary state of some solvable reaction - diffusion systems . in section",
    "v , we give our results for the contact process .",
    "finally , in section vi we present some conclusions and an outlook on further applications of the real space rg technique .",
    "in this section we discuss the relation between stochastic processes in continuous time on the one hand and quantum mechanics on the other hand @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this relation has been ( independently ) discovered by several authors , and is now well established .",
    "we only give a brief overview , with the main purpose of fixing our notation .",
    "consider a one dimensional lattice of @xmath23 sites and let @xmath24 ( @xmath25 when no ( a ) particle is present at site @xmath26 ) be the microscopic configuration of the particle system .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath27 the probability that the system is in configuration @xmath28 at time @xmath29 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath27 is determined by the transition rates @xmath30 of the model . in general one of these",
    "is used to fix the time scale ( say @xmath31 ) .",
    "we will collect the remaining rates in a vector @xmath32 .",
    "next , we introduce a state vector @xmath33 latexmath:[\\ ] ] in principle correlation functions can be calculated in a similar way .    near the critical fixed point @xmath110",
    ", we get from ( [ 2.4 ] ) for the singular part of @xmath20 to leading order in @xmath111 @xmath112 from this relation we see that @xmath113 determines the rescaling of the particle density at criticality .",
    "we write @xmath114 where @xmath115 can then be interpreted as the fractal dimension of the sites that are occupied by particles at criticality . finally , from ( [ 2.5 ] )",
    "we get the behaviour of the particle density close to the critical point as @xmath116 so that we obtain the scaling relation @xmath117 .",
    "finally , @xmath6 can be obtained from the scaling relation @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to extend these reasonings to the case where the transformation of @xmath104 is more complicated .",
    "we thus see that a complete characterisation of the stationary state particle density and of all the critical properties of the system can be obtained from our rg approach . in the next two sections we test our method on simple stochastic systems .",
    "the first one is an exactly solvable reaction - diffusion system with a trivial transition .",
    "the second one is the well known contact process which has a non trivial transition thought to be in the dp universality class .",
    "we consider a model with diffusion , decoagulation ( which is the process @xmath119 ,  @xmath120 ) and coagulation .",
    "we will use the diffusion rate to fix the time scale , so that our model has two independent rates which we will denote as @xmath121 ( decoagulation ) and @xmath122 ( coagulation ) .",
    "the local hamiltonian @xmath123 in this case can most conveniently be written as a @xmath124-matrix @xmath125 or in terms of the matrices @xmath44 as @xmath126 with a similarity transformation this hamiltonian can be mapped onto that of a free fermion system @xcite , from which many exact results can be obtained .",
    "to renormalise this model , we take @xmath127 , so that @xmath58 is exactly given by ( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath123 can be calculated trivially .",
    "the ground state is doubly degenerate and we identify the corresponding eigenstates as effective spin states .",
    "in particular , we have ( we use spin language where @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) denotes a vacancy ( an @xmath130-particle ) ) @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "notice that we normalise the states as probability vectors ( and not quantum mechanically ) .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath95 using ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "we find that the renormalised hamiltonian contains the same terms as ( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the transformation conserves the stochasticity condition .",
    "the renormalised diffusion rate is @xmath134 .",
    "we divide the hamiltonian by this factor ( rescaling of time ) .",
    "then @xmath95 has completely the same form as @xmath36 but with renormalised values for @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the rg equations for @xmath121 and @xmath122 are @xmath135 the flow generated by these equations is shown in figure 1 .",
    "there is a fixed point at @xmath136 ( pure coagulation fixed point ) .",
    "the line @xmath137 is an invariant line .",
    "the rg equations , linearised at the fixed point , have the relevant eigenvalue @xmath138 , together with a marginal eigenvalue in the @xmath122 direction .

    "we see that all points with @xmath146 flow to points where @xmath147 . in that limit @xmath148 .",
    "then , using ( [ 2.4.b ] ) we can obtain the particle density . in figure 2",
    "we plot the result for @xmath20 as a function of @xmath149 together with the exact result @xcite @xmath150 within the numerical accuracy , both results coincide .",
    "hence it seems that we recover the exact result !",
    "this might seem surprising since our calculation is only precise to first order in @xmath55 .",
    "with hindsight the accuracy of our result can be understood by the fact that the ground state of the whole system is a product of one particle states .",
    "nevertheless , this calculation illustrates nicely the use of the method .",
    "moreover it gives an rg - flow for the problem which can not be obtained in any other way .    to conclude this section",
    ", we calculate the exponent @xmath19 which determines the behaviour of @xmath20 near @xmath151 . from the exact result ( [ 2.exact ] ) ,",
    "one obviously has @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , from ( [ 4.2.c ] ) , we have @xmath152 , hence @xmath153 and using @xmath138 we recover the exact result @xmath21 .    at this place",
    "it is appropriate to mention that for other simple reaction diffusion systems we can also recover exactly known results .",
    "an example is a model with diffusion , decoagulation and death ( which is the process @xmath154 ) .",
    "this model undergoes a first order transition @xcite . when the decoagulation rate is greater then the death rate , @xmath148 , whereas when the opposite inequality holds , one has @xmath155 .",
    "the rg recovers this exact result . as usual",
    "the first order transition is controlled by a discontinuity fixed point .    also for a model with diffusion , annihilation and pair creation @xmath156",
    ", we recover the exact result , first obtained by z. rcz @xcite , that @xmath20 grows with the square root of the pair creation rate .",
    "the contact proces was originally introduced as a simple model for an epidemic @xcite . in that interpretation",
    "a particle corresponds to sick person , and a vacancy to a healthy individual . in",
    "the process particles can disappear ( @xmath157 ) with a rate @xmath31 .",
    "empty sites can become occupied with a rate @xmath158 , where @xmath98 is the number of occupied neighbours of the empty site ( this represents contamination in epidemic terms ) .",
    "this model can not be solved exactly , but its critical exponents are known to high accuracy @xcite . on the basis of numerical data , and from symmetry arguments",
    ", it is generally believed that the model is in the dp - universality class @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian corresponding to this model contains one - site terms ( for the process @xmath157 ) and two - site terms ( for the contamination process ) .",
    "the local hamiltonian for the model is @xmath159 we have split the whole hamiltonian in such a way that @xmath123 contains one two - site contribution and one one - site term . in this way ,",
    "when performing the rg , both @xmath58 en @xmath160 will contain an equal number of one - site and two - site terms .",
    "this garantees , at least for the contact process , that the ground state of the intracell hamiltonian is a doublet .",
    "these states are then the natural candidates to be used as effective cell spins",
    ".    we will perform a renormalisation for this model using a cell with @xmath161 .",
    "the calculation is straightforward and can most effectively be done using @xmath162mathematica .",
    "it came as a surprise to us that also in this case , there is no proliferation of interactions in the renormalised hamiltonian .",
    "the rg - equation for @xmath163 is @xmath164 this equation has one non - trivial repulsive fixed point at @xmath165 .",
    "this value is surprisingly close to the best known numerical value for the contact process which is @xmath166 ( all numerical results are taken from @xcite ) . from linearising the rg - equations near the fixed point ,",
    "we obtain @xmath167 , from which we obtain @xmath168 , to be compared with the numerically determined value of @xmath169 .",
    "as explained in section 3 , one can obtain the exponent @xmath98 from the rescaling of the unit of time . in this case",
    "we have @xmath170 from which we obtain @xmath171 ( to be compared with @xmath172 ) .",
    "finally we need to determine @xmath115 .",
    "as explained in section 3 , one therefore has to renormalise the operator @xmath104 . in a cell with @xmath173",
    "this can be done in several ways .",
    "either one projects the operator @xmath174 where @xmath16 is a site at or near the middle of the cell .",
    "alternatively we can take an ` average ' operator @xmath175 @xmath176 we have performed both calculations .",
    "they give respectively @xmath177 and @xmath178 , from which we obtain @xmath179 , respectively @xmath180 .",
    "these values should be compared with the precise numerical estimate @xmath181 .",
    "other exponents can be obtained using scaling relations .",
    "we get @xmath182 whereas the best known values are @xmath183 .",
    "we thus see that , taking into account the smallness of the cell considered , our estimates of @xmath184 and all critical exponents are close to the known values .    in figure 3 we finally plot @xmath185 as obtained from our rg approach . at the scale of the figure it almost coincides with the results from other approaches .",
    "we are currently extending our calculations for the contact process to larger cell sizes .",
    "we hope that our approach , combined with suitable extrapolation techniques , is able to give very precise estimates of critical exponents .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the applicability to reaction - diffusion processes of a quantum real space rg method .",
    "we first studied simple processes for which exact information is available . in three cases ,",
    "these exact results are reproduced in calculations done on very small cells .",
    "so far , we encountered one system in which the rg predicted wrong results .",
    "this is a model with diffusion , coagulation and birth ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "when the diffusion rate equals the coagulation rate , this model belongs to a class which is , at least partially , integrable @xcite . for small birth rates",
    "@xmath187 , @xmath20 is known to grow as @xmath188 .",
    "the application of our technique to that model raised several difficulties .",
    "the ground state of @xmath58 is a singlet , and for the first excited state there is a crossing of energy levels ( in finite systems ) .",
    "hence , there is no obvious choice for the effective cell states . for a specific choice we made",
    ", the renormalised hamiltonian @xmath95 turns out to have a form different from the original hamiltonian @xmath36 , but there is a similarity mapping this @xmath95 onto @xmath36 with renormalised couplings , and an extra decoagulation term . if we define the full rg as the projection ( [ 2.1 ] ) , followed by the similarity we are able to obtain a flow in parameter space .",
    "unfortunately , our results indicate that for cells with @xmath127 and @xmath161 , @xmath20 grows as @xmath189 .",
    "we hope to clarify the rg for this model in the future .    for the contact process , which contains a non - trivial critical point , rather accurate estimates for the location of the critical point and for critical exponents",
    "are obtained from a calculation on a cell of @xmath190 sites .",
    "this justifies the hope that by going to larger cells and using good extrapolation techniques very precise exponent estimates can be obtained .",
    "we are currently performing such calculations .",
    "another project we hope to carry through is a study of the barw with @xmath88 . as stated in the introduction , there are few reliable analytical results on the critical properties of this system .",
    "a particularly nice model that is known to be in this universality class was introduced by menyhrd .",
    "it is a non - equilibrium ising model ( nekim ) with glauber dynamics at zero temperature and kawasaki dynamics at infinite temperature @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that this model is selfdual @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy of the quantum hamiltonian corresponding with this model is for all finite systems again doubly degenerated , so that effective cell states can be defined unambiguously .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian for the nekim contains a three - site interaction term . under the rg ,",
    "performed to first order , such a term will be mapped onto a two - cell interaction term . however , by extending the slac - approach to second order in @xmath55 , as discussed in section 3 , one could generate a renormalised three - cell interaction .",
    "in fact , from a mathematical point of view , the hamiltonian of the nekim is rather similar to that of a transverse ising model with three spin interactions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "that model also has a selfduality and was renormalised successfully by using our approach to second order @xcite .",
    "an alternative model in the universality class of the even-@xmath16-barwis a recently introduced variant of the contact process in which particles disappear and are contaminated in pairs @xcite .",
    "since this model does nt involve any diffusion , it may be more simple to analyse .",
    "it has of course to be admitted that real space rg methods in general involve some ill understood approximations .",
    "nevertheless , it is our opinion that the results presented here give considerable hope that our rg can succesfully be used to further understand the critical behaviour of non exactly solved systems such as the barw .",
