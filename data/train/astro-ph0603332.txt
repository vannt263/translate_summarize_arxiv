    "studies of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) explore somewhat different environmental conditions from those typically probed in our own galactic ism .",
    "the magellanic clouds are characterized by lower overall metallicities ( @xmath60.3 dex for the lmc , @xmath60.6 to @xmath60.7 dex for the smc ) , lower dust - to - gas ratios , generally stronger ambient radiation fields , and significant differences in uv extinction ( especially in the smc ) .",
    "these differences are predicted to affect the structure and properties of interstellar clouds in the lmc and smc ( wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ; pak et al . 1998 ) and , in principle , they may also affect the relative abundances of various constituents of those clouds .",
    "comparisons of the relative interstellar abundances of different atomic and molecular species  for the diverse environments in the milky way , the lmc , and the smc  may thus give insights into the physical and chemical processes shaping the clouds .",
    "improvements in instrumentation ( in several wavelength domains ) over the past 10 to 15 years have begun to provide more detailed and accurate information on the properties of diffuse atomic gas in the magellanic clouds . by combining 21 cm data from both the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes 64 m radio telescope , stanimirovic et al .",

    "relatively high - resolution uv spectra obtained with _",
    "hst _ for a handful of stars in the magellanic clouds have revealed some differences in the patterns of gas - phase elemental abundances ( and thus , presumably , in the depletions of those elements into dust grains ) and also have yielded estimates for the local thermal pressures and densities in several sight lines ( welty et al . 1997 , 2001 , and in prep . ) . while earlier studies of the optical interstellar absorption lines of and focused largely on the kinematics of the gas in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , songaila et al .",

    "surveys of the @xmath7co @xmath8 = 10 emission line at 115 ghz have provided the most complete inventories of relatively dense molecular gas in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the initial surveys , undertaken at a spatial resolution of 8.8 arcmin ( @xmath9140 pc for the lmc ; @xmath9160 pc for the smc ) , found co emission over about 10% of the lmc ( cohen et al .",
    "1988 ) and over about 20% of the main smc bar ( rubio et al .",
    "1991 ) ; a number of distinct molecular clouds ( or cloud complexes ) were identified in the two galaxies .",
    "subsequent observations with the sest telescope , at much higher resolution ( 45 arcsec , corresponding to 12 pc for the lmc and 14 pc for the smc ) , explored the regions around known far - ir sources , star - forming regions , and prior co detections in much greater detail ( israel et al .",
    "1993 , 2003 , and references therein ) . the higher resolution sest data indicate that the co emission in the magellanic clouds is ( 1 ) weaker than that seen in galactic molecular clouds of comparable size , and ( 2 ) concentrated in fairly small , discrete clumps of relatively dense molecular gas , with little emission from the lower density `` interclump '' gas ( e.g. , lequeux et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the more recent large - scale surveys performed with the nanten telescope ( resolution 2.6 arcmin ) have confirmed the clumpy nature of the co emission , with about 8% of the lmc pointings and about 10% of the ( more limited ) smc pointings yielding detections ( mizuno et al .",
    "2001 ; yamaguchi et al .",
    "the molecular clouds seen in co are well correlated with young stellar clusters and regions , but poorly correlated with older clusters and supernova remnants  consistent with relatively rapid dispersal of the molecular gas ( fukui et al .",
    "1999 ; yamaguchi et al .",
    "observations of a number of other molecular species , near peaks in the co emission in the n159 region of the lmc and in the lirs  36 star - forming region in the smc , have provided some information on molecular abundances , isotopic ratios , and cloud structure ( johansson et al .",
    "1994 ; chin et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the n159 region ,",
    "the molecular abundances are about a factor of 10 lower ( on average ) than the corresponding values found for orion kl and tmc-1 .",
    "similar abundances are found for a number of molecular species in lirs  36 , though the abundances of several nitrogen - bearing species ( including cn ) appear to be lower by an additional factor of 10 .",
    "unfortunately , very little is known regarding optical / uv absorption from molecules in the magellanic clouds , apart from the recent _ fuse _ h@xmath2 survey of tumlinson et al .",
    "detections of the optical lines of ch and ch@xmath0 have been reported only toward sn 1987a ( magain & gillet 1987 ) ; far - uv lines of co and/or hd have been measured in several other lines of sight ( bluhm & de boer 2001 ; andr et al .",
    "because the optical molecular lines evidently are fairly weak in the magellanic clouds and because the stellar targets typically are relatively faint ( @xmath10 @xmath9 1114 mag ) , efficient detection of the lines requires both a large telescope and a spectrograph that can achieve fairly high spectral resolution .",
    "we have therefore used the eso vlt / uves to obtain high s / n , moderately high resolution optical spectra of a number of stars in the lmc and smc , in an attempt to expand the sample of detections of ch , ch@xmath0 , and cn  so that we may then compare the relative abundances of those species with the values and trends found in our galaxy .",
    "the uves spectra also cover the wavelengths of a number of the enigmatic diffuse interstellar bands  broader interstellar absorption features first recognized in the spectra of galactic stars more than 80 years ago ( heger 1922 ) .",
    "while the dibs are generally thought to be due to large carbon - based molecules , no specific carrier has been securely identified as yet for any of the several hundred features now known ( e.g. , jenniskens & dsert 1994 ; herbig 1995 ; tuairisg et al .",

    "the recent detections of several of the stronger dibs toward a handful of magellanic clouds stars seem to indicate that the dibs are generally weaker in the lmc and smc ( ehrenfreund et al .",
    "2002 ; sollerman et al . 2005 ; cox et al .",

    "multiple exposures , generally of length 20 to 45 minutes , were obtained for most targets over the three nights , with the camera tilted by @xmath2050 units on the second and third nights to ensure that the spectra fell on slightly different parts of the three ccds .",
    "the run was characterized by very good observing conditions : low humidity , good transparency , and seeing generally better than 0.8 arcsec .",

    "however , the specific dependences of dib strength on the abundances of other species and on the local environmental conditions must be better understood .",
    "for example , in the local galactic ism , the equivalent widths of the dibs at 5780 , 5797 , and 6284   generally seem to be closely related to both @xmath4 ( ) and @xmath5  with similar correlation coefficients , slopes of order unity , and small scatter about the mean relationships ( fig .",

    "because of the lower overall metallicities , the ( typically ) lower dust - to - gas ratios and molecular fractions , and the generally stronger radiation fields in the magellanic clouds , one might expect the dibs to be weaker there .",
    "the currently available data indicate that the dibs at 5780 , 5797 , and 6284   are generally weaker [ on average and relative to @xmath4 ( ) ] than their counterparts in the galactic ism  by factors of 79 in the lmc and factors of order 20 in the smc ( ehrenfreund et al .",

    "1997 ; sonnentrucker et al .",
    "for example , relative to @xmath4 ( ) , the dibs are weaker ( on average ) in both the sco - oph and orion trapezium regions , where the presence of numerous early - type stars and lower than average abundances of both trace neutral species ( e.g. , , ) and molecules ( e.g. , h@xmath2 , ch ) suggest that the radiation fields might be enhanced ( herbig 1993 ; jenniskens et al . 1994 ; welty & hobbs 2001 ) .",

    "we have discussed the molecular absorption lines and diffuse interstellar bands seen in high s / n , moderately high resolution optical spectra of 7 smc and 13 lmc stars , most of which also exhibit relatively strong absorption from h@xmath2 and . absorption from ch @xmath234300 and/or ch@xmath0 @xmath234232 has now been detected toward 3 smc and 9 lmc stars , with typical equivalent widths of 15 m ; cn @xmath233874 is detected only toward sk  143 ( smc ) and sk@xmath12 ( lmc ) .",
    "these data represent nearly all the reported detections of optical molecular absorption lines in interstellar media beyond our galaxy .",

    "column density relationships between various atomic and molecular species in the lmc and smc have been compared with the corresponding trends found in the local galactic ism and in two more restricted regions ( sco - oph and the orion trapezium ) known to exhibit somewhat different abundances of trace neutral atomic and molecular species . in the lmc ,",

    "much higher local densities are inferred if it is assumed that the observed ch is due to steady - state gas - phase chemical reactions ; much better agreement with the values derived from h@xmath2 is found if ch is instead primarily formed via the non - thermal process(es ) responsible for the observed ch@xmath0 .",
    "a significant fraction of the ch and ch@xmath0 observed in diffuse molecular material in the magellanic clouds may arise in photon - dominated regions ( which should be more extensive there than in our galaxy ) .",
