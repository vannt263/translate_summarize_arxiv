    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) are distributed collections of sensors with limited capabilities for computations and wireless communications .",
    "such networks will likely be deployed in hostile environments where cryptographic protection will be needed to enable secure communications , sensor - capture detection , key revocation and sensor disabling . however , traditional key exchange and distribution protocols based on trusting third parties have been found inadequate for large - scale wsns , e.g. , see @xcite for discussions of some of the challenges .",
    "_ random _ key predistribution schemes were recently proposed to address some of these challenges .",
    "the idea of randomly assigning secure keys to sensor nodes prior to network deployment was first proposed by eschenauer and gligor @xcite .",
    "the modeling and performance of the eg scheme , as we refer to it hereafter , has been extensively investigated @xcite , with most of the focus being on the _ full visibility _ case where nodes are all within communication range of each other . under full visibility ,",
    "the eg scheme induces so - called _ random key graphs _ @xcite ( also known in the literature as _ uniform _ random intersection graphs @xcite ) .",
    "conditions on the graph parameters to ensure the absence of isolated nodes have been obtained independently in @xcite while the papers @xcite are concerned with zero - one laws for connectivity .",
    "although the assumption of full visibility does away with the wireless nature of the communication infrastructure supporting wsns , in return this simplification makes it possible to focus on how randomizing the key selections affects the establishment of a secure network ; the connectivity results for the underlying random key graph then provide helpful ( though optimistic ) guidelines to dimension the eg scheme .",
    "the work of eschenauer and gligor has spurred the development of other key distribution schemes which perform better than the eg scheme in some aspects , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "although these schemes somewhat improve resiliency , they fail to provide _ perfect _ resiliency against node capture attacks .",
    "more importantly , they do not provide a node with the ability to authenticate the identity of the neighbors with which it communicates .",
    "this is a major drawback in terms of network security since _",
    "node - to - node authentication _ may help detect node misbehavior , and provides resistance against node replication attacks @xcite .    to address this issue chan et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed the following random _ pairwise _ key predistribution scheme : before deployment , each of the @xmath1 sensor nodes is paired ( offline ) with @xmath2 distinct nodes which are randomly selected amongst all other @xmath3 nodes . for each such pairing ,",
    "a unique pairwise key is generated and stored in the memory modules of each of the paired sensors along with the i d of the other node .",
    "a secure link can then be established between two communicating nodes if at least one of them has been assigned to the other , i.e. , if they have at least one key in common .",
    "see section [ sec : modelpairwise ] for implementation details .",
    "this scheme has the following advantages over the eg scheme ( and others ) : ( i ) even if some nodes are captured , the secrecy of the remaining nodes is _ perfectly _ preserved ; and ( ii ) unlike earlier schemes , this scheme enables both node - to - node authentication and quorum - based revocation without involving a base station .",
    "given these advantages , we found it of interest to model the pairwise scheme of chan et al . and to assess its performance .",
    "in @xcite we began a formal investigation along these lines .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the random graph on the vertex set @xmath5 where distinct nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are adjacent if they have a pairwise key in common ; as in earlier work on the eg scheme this corresponds to modeling the random pairwise distribution scheme under full visibility . in @xcite we showed that the probability of @xmath4 being connected approaches @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) as @xmath1 grows large if @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "if @xmath11 ) , i.e. , @xmath4 is asymptotically almost surely ( a.a.s . )",
    "connected whenever @xmath10 .    in the present paper",
    ", we continue our study of connectivity properties but from a different perspective : we note that in many applications , the sensor nodes are expected to be deployed gradually over time .",
    "yet , the pairwise key distribution is an _ offline _ pairing mechanism which simultaneously involves all @xmath1 nodes .",
    "thus , once the network size @xmath1 is set , there is no way to add more nodes to the network and still _ recursively _ expand the pairwise distribution scheme ( as is possible for the eg scheme ) .",
    "however , as explained in section [ subsec : multiplephasesimplementingpairwise ] , the gradual deployment of a large number of sensor nodes is nevertheless feasible from a practical viewpoint . in that context",
    "we are interested in understanding how the parameter @xmath2 needs to scale with @xmath1 large in order to ensure that connectivity is _ maintained _ a.a.s . throughout gradual deployment .",
    "we also discuss the number of keys needed in the memory module of each sensor to achieve secure connectivity at every step of the gradual deployment . since sensor nodes are expected to have very limited memory , it is crucial for a key distribution scheme to have _ low _ memory requirements @xcite .",
    "the key contributions of the paper can be stated as follows : let @xmath12 denote the subgraph of @xmath4 restricted to the nodes @xmath13 .",
    "we first present scaling laws for the absence of isolated nodes in the form of a full zero - one law , and use these results to formulate conditions under which @xmath12 is a.a.s .",
    "_ not _ connected .",
    "then , with @xmath14 , we give conditions on @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath15 so that @xmath16 is a.a.s .",
    "connected for each @xmath17 ; this corresponds to the case where the network is connected in _ each _ of the @xmath18 phases of the gradual deployment . as with the eg scheme",
    ", these scaling conditions can be helpful for dimensioning the pairwise key distribution in the case of gradual deployment .",
    "we also discuss the required number of keys to be kept in the memory module of each sensor to achieve secure connectivity at every step of the gradual deployment . since sensor nodes are expected to have very limited memory , it is crucial for a key distribution scheme to have _ low _ memory requirements @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the eg scheme ( and its variants ) , the key rings produced by the pairwise scheme of chan et al . have variable size between @xmath2 and @xmath19 .",
    "still , we show that the _ maximum _ key ring size is on the order @xmath20 with very high probability provided @xmath21 . combining with the connectivity results ,",
    "we conclude that the sensor network can maintain the a.a.s .",
    "connectivity through all phases of the deployment when the number of keys to be stored in each sensor s memory is @xmath0 ; this is a key ring size comparable to that of the eg scheme ( in realistic wsn scenarios @xcite ) .",
    "these results show that the pairwise scheme can also be feasible when the network is deployed gradually over time . however , as with the results in @xcite , the assumption of full visibility may yield a dimensioning of the pairwise scheme which is too optimistic .",
    "this is due to the fact that the unreliable nature of wireless links has not been incorporated in the model .",
    "however the results obtained in this paper already yield a number of interesting observations : the obtained zero - one laws differ significantly from the corresponding results in the single deployment case @xcite .",
    "thus , the gradual deployment may have a significant impact on the dimensioning of the pairwise distribution algorithm .",
    "yet , the required number of keys to achieve secure connectivity being @xmath0 , it is still feasible to use the pairwise scheme in the case of gradual deployment ; the required key ring size in eg scheme is also @xmath0 under full - visibility @xcite .",
    "the random pairwise key predistribution scheme of chan et al . is parametrized by two positive integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that @xmath22 .",
    "there are @xmath1 nodes which are labelled @xmath23 . with unique ids @xmath24 .",
    "write @xmath25 and set @xmath26 for each @xmath23 .",
    "with node @xmath6 we associate a subset @xmath27 nodes selected at _ random _ from @xmath28  we say that each of the nodes in @xmath27 is paired to node @xmath6 . thus , for any subset @xmath29 , we require @xmath30 } = \\left \\ { \\begin{array}{ll } { { n-1}\\choose{k}}^{-1 } & \\mbox{if $ |a|=k$ } \\\\                &                    \\\\ 0              & \\mbox{otherwise",
    ". } \\end{array } \\right .\\ ] ] the selection of @xmath27 is done _ uniformly _ amongst all subsets of @xmath28 which are of size exactly @xmath2 .",
    "the rvs @xmath31 are assumed to be mutually independent so that @xmath32 } = \\prod_{i=1}^n { { \\mathbb{p}}\\left [ { \\gamma_{n , i } = a_i } \\right]}\\ ] ] for arbitrary @xmath33 subsets of @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "on the basis of this _ offline _ random pairing , we now construct the key rings @xmath35 , one for each node , as follows : assumed available is a collection of @xmath36 distinct cryptographic keys @xmath37  these keys are drawn from a very large pool of keys ; in practice the pool size is assumed to be much larger than @xmath36 , and can be safely taken to be infinite for the purpose of our discussion .",
    "now , fix @xmath23 and let @xmath38 denote a labeling of @xmath27 . for each node @xmath7 in @xmath27 paired to @xmath6 , the cryptographic key @xmath39",
    "is associated with @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , if the random set @xmath27 is realized as @xmath40 with @xmath41 , then an obvious labeling consists in @xmath42 for each @xmath43 with key @xmath44 associated with node @xmath45 . of course other labeling",
    "are possible .",
    "e.g. , according to decreasing labels or according to a random permutation . the pairwise key @xmath46\\ ] ] is constructed and inserted in the memory modules of both nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "inherent to this construction is the fact that the key @xmath47 is assigned _ exclusively _ to the pair of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , hence the terminology pairwise distribution scheme .",
    "the key ring @xmath48 of node @xmath6 is the set @xmath49 as we take into account the possibility that node @xmath6 was paired to some other node @xmath7 . as mentioned earlier , under full visibility , two node ,",
    "say @xmath6 and @xmath7 , can establish a secure link if at least one of the events @xmath50 or @xmath51 is taking place .",
    "note that both events can take place , in which case the memory modules of node @xmath6 and @xmath7 each contain the distinct keys @xmath47 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is also plain that by construction this scheme supports node - to - node authentication .",
    "initially @xmath1 node identities were generated and the key rings @xmath53 were constructed as indicated above ",
    "here @xmath1 stands for the maximum possible network size and should be selected large enough .",
    "this key selection procedure does not require the physical presence of the sensor entities and can be implemented completely on the software level .",
    "we now describe how this offline pairwise key distribution scheme can support gradual network deployment in consecutive stages . in the initial phase of deployment , with @xmath54 , let @xmath55 sensors be produced and given the labels @xmath56 .",
    "the key rings @xmath57 are then inserted into the memory modules of the sensors @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "imagine now that more sensors are needed , say @xmath59 sensors with @xmath60 .",
    "then , @xmath61 additional sensors would be produced , this second batch of sensors would be assigned labels @xmath62 , and the key rings @xmath63 would be inserted into their memory modules .",
    "once this is done , these @xmath64 new sensors are added to the network ( which now comprises @xmath65 deployed sensors ) .",
    "this step may be repeated a number times : in fact , for some finite integer @xmath18 , consider positive scalars @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 by convention ) .",
    "we can then deploy the sensor network in @xmath18 consecutive phases , with the @xmath68 phase adding @xmath69 new nodes to the network for each @xmath70 .",
    "the pairwise distribution scheme naturally gives rise to the following class of random graphs : with @xmath71 and positive integer @xmath2 with @xmath72 , the distinct nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are said to be _ adjacent _ , written @xmath73 , if and only if they have at least one key in common in their key rings , namely @xmath74 let @xmath4 denote the undirected random graph on the vertex set @xmath5 induced through the adjacency notion ( [ eq : adjacency ] ) . with @xmath75}$ ] , we have shown @xcite the following zero - one law .    _ with @xmath2 a positive integer",

    "we now present the main results of the paper .",
    "we start with the results regarding the key ring sizes : theorem [ thm : onelaw+connectivity ] shows that very small values of @xmath2 suffice for a.a.s .",
    "connectivity of the random graph @xmath4 .",
    "the mere fact that @xmath4 becomes connected even with very small @xmath2 values does not imply that the _ number _ of keys ( i.e. , the size @xmath78 ) to achieve connectivity is necessarily small .",
    "this is because in contrast with the eg scheme and its variants , the pairwise scheme produces key rings of variable size between @xmath2 and @xmath79 . to explore this issue",
    "further we first obtain minimal conditions on a scaling @xmath80 which ensure that the key ring of a node has size roughly of the order ( of its mean ) @xmath81 when @xmath1 is large .",
