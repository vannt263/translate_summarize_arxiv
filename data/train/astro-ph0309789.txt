    "wc wolf - rayet central stars of planetary nebulae ( [ wc ] central stars of pne ) are h - deficient stars that exhibit strong ionic emission lines of helium , carbon and oxygen from their dense stellar winds . amongst the coolest central stars in this group are cpd56@xmath08032  ( the nucleus of the pn he  3 - 1333 ) and the central star of he  2 - 113 ( both classified as [ wc10 ] , crowther et al .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found the mid - infrared kao spectra of both these objects to show very strong unidentified infrared bands ( uibs  usually attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , pahs ) .",
    "indeed , both the nebular c / o ratios ( de marco , barlow & storey 1997 ) and the ratio of uib luminosity to total ir dust luminosity ( cohen et al .",
    "1989 ) for these two objects are the largest known .",
    "it was therefore a major surprise when mid- and far - ir infrared space observatory spectra of these two objects showed the presence of many emission features longwards of 20  @xmath2 m that could be attributed to crystalline silicate and water ice particles ( barlow 1997 , waters et al .",
    "1998a , cohen et al . 1999 ) , indicating a dual dust chemistry , i.e. the simultaneous presence of both c - rich dust and o - rich dust .",
    "the dual dust chemistry phenomenon in pne appears to show a strong correlation with the presence of a late wc ( [ wcl ] ) nucleus  four out of six [ wc8 - 11 ] nuclei studied by cohen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed similar dual dust chemistries . in the context of a single star scenario ,",
    "this would point to a recent transition ( within the last @xmath11000  yr ) between the o- and the c - rich surface chemistries .",
    "however , the probability of finding a post - agb object that had recently changed from an o - rich to a c - rich surface chemistry due to a third dredge - up event should be very low indeed .",
    "an alternative scenario envisages these systems as binaries ( waters et al .",
    "1998a , cohen et al . 1999 , 2002 ) , in which the o - rich silicates are trapped in a disk as a result of a past mass transfer event , with the c - rich particles being more widely distributed in the nebula as a result of recent ejections of c - rich material by the nucleus",
    "cpd56@xmath08032  exhibits a variable optical lightcurve ( pollacco et al .",
    "1992 , jones et al .",
    "1999 ) , with minima which are @xmath11  mag deep and have a 5-year pseudo - period ( cohen et al .",
    "this was interpreted by cohen et al . as precession of a dusty disk .",
    "we present an updated light - curve for cpd56@xmath08032  in fig .  1 .    de marco et al .",
    "( 2002 ) presented hst / stis spatially - resolved spectroscopy of cpd56@xmath08032 , obtained during its third visual light minimum , which revealed the stellar near uv and blue optical continuum to be split into two spectra separated by about 0.10 arcsec . once other possibilities were excluded ( e.g. , instrumental problems or the presence of two stars )",
    ", the simpler explanation is that cpd56@xmath08032 s light is seen reflected by the upper and lower rim of a dusty disk or torus seen close to edge - on .",
    "if so , cpd56@xmath08032could be similar to the red rectangle ( hd44179 ; osterbart et al .",
    "1997 ) , whose binary central star light is seen indirectly , reflected by the rims of an edge - on disk . in this binary scenario , cpd56@xmath08032 s light - curve",
    "could also be interpreted as cpd56@xmath08032 s orbital motion taking it in and out of alignment with a denser part of the disk , such that its brightness is modulated in step with the binary period .",
    "an alternative scenario that is more in line with the asymmetric lightcurve declines , conceives a dust clump in orbit with the disk passing in front of cpd56@xmath08032  every 5 years . the companion can not be bright enough to contaminate substantially its spectrum , which is reasonably fit with a single wolf - rayet model atmosphere ( de marco & crowther 1998 ) .",
    "cpd56@xmath08032 s putative companion could plausibly be a low mass main sequence star , such as a k dwarf .",
    "interestingly , the red rectangle , also a binary , is the only system to have a double dust chemistry and a central star which is _ not _ hydrogen - deficient . from this",
    "we could suggest that the red rectangle s a supergiant central star ( the other is thought to be an unseen white dwarf [ menshchikov et al .",
    "2002 ] ) might be on its way to becoming hydrogen deficient .    the conjecture that [ wc ] stars are binary systems is in harmony with the fact that binarity is generally known to promote mass - loss . for instance , all the massive wolf - rayet stars in the metal - poor small magellanic cloud are binaries .",
    "this has been explained with the fact that the low metallicity of the smc leaves its stars with atmospheres with relatively low opacities , too low to develop the dense wolf - rayet winds .",
    "hence the only massive wolf - rayet stars possible in the smc are those where a companion has facilitated mass - loss .",
    "a direct detection of binarity via radial velocity monitoring ( see section 3 ) , is unlikely in the case of [ wc ] central stars , because of their intrinsically variable ( e.g. balick et al .",
    "1996 ) , broad emission lines .",
    "there are increasing indications that binary - star processes are intimately related to the ejection of many , or possibly even most , pne .",
    "the evidence includes : the fact that @xmath110% of pn nuclei are found to be very close binaries ( periods of hours to a few days ; bond & livio 1990 , bond 2000 ) through photometric monitoring ; population - synthesis studies suggesting that these may be just the short - period tail of a much larger binary population extending up to orbital periods of several months ( yungelson et al . 1993 , han et al .",
    "1995 ) ; and the prevalence of highly non - spherical morphologies among pne .    the photometric search technique does not work for binaries with periods of more than a few days , since it relies on proximity effects .",
    "we have therefore carried out radial - velocity monitoring of a sample of pn nuclei , in order to search for the anticipated population of binaries with periods up to a few months .",
    "if they do exist , there will be new implications for the evolution of binary populations , the origin of compact binaries ( cvs , sn  ia progenitors ) , and even the question of whether single stars can produce visible ionized pne at all .",
    "this program was started in may 2002 at the 3.5-m wiyn telescope . despite being plagued by very bad weather and some instrument problems",
    ", we report that 8 of the 18 central stars for which we have more than five data points have _ clear _ radial velocity variability .",
    "the independent , but similar program of pollacco et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) returned a similar radial velocity variable central star fraction .",
    "however , it will take additional observations for us to have robust statistics , and to determine orbital periods needed to show conclusively that the velocity variations are due to binary motion and not , for instance , to wind variability .",
