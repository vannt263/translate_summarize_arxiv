    "the analysis of charmonium system motivated important steps to understand quantitatively the mechanism of quark confinement in various hadrons .",
    "the first approach was made by introducing confining potential to estimate the masses of excited states just after the discovery of @xmath6 @xcite . because the charm quark was taken to be massive , nonrelativistic schrdinger equation was applied to predict the excited states and the predictions turned out to be quite successful .",
    "later the same formalism was used to calculate the detailed splittings of spectra in the more massive system of bottomonium .",
    "these successes lead to the consideration of spin splittings and a systematic derivation was possible with the introduction of one gluon exchange diagrams @xcite .",
    "although the spin splittings due to spin - spin , spin - orbit , and tensor forces have been calculated successfully , the form of confining potential has not been determined clearly and various models were tried to explain quarkonium spectra .",
    "the discrimination of different potential models can be carried out by comparing the spectral pattern of excited states but the observations of excited states with orbital angular momentum had been tedious processes analyzing every decaying channels between excited states . during these analyzing processes new states with somewhat peculiar aspects of decaying patterns",
    "have been observed and named as @xmath0 particles @xcite .    in order to predict the energy levels of quarkonium states ,",
    "we need to fix several parameters such as quark mass , strong coupling constant , and potential parameter .",
    "these parameters are usually taken to be independent from each other , however , they are interrelated through the exchanges of self - interacting gluons .",
    "the dynamical quark mass induced from the excited quarkonium states includes large gluonic contributions and the strong coupling constant @xmath7 varies according to the value of exchanged gluonic momentum @xcite , and the potential parameter represents just the effects of gluonic interactions . because these problems are not resolved as yet from first principles , we have to fix these parameters by considering observed data and the most explicit data to be considered are the observed energy spectra .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0 particles in this viewpoint is necessary and we will carry out this analysis in this paper .    in sec.[sec :",
    "s2 ] , we will review the observational processes of @xmath0 particles , and in sec.[sec : s3 ] , charmonium states are calculated with spin - dependent forces .",
    "the calculated and the observed @xmath0 particles are compared in sec.[sec : s4 ] and the final section is devoted to discussions .",
    "the history of @xmath0 particles is quite long . for example , in 1974 meson table we can find five states @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "all these states were unestablished at that time while only 21 meson states were accepted as established for isoscalar or isovector states .",
    "the state @xmath8 was renamed as @xmath13 when the naming scheme for mesons was changed in 1986 .",
    "the change of naming scheme had been motivated by former papers @xcite classifying meson states into radially and orbitally excited states of quark - antiquark bound system . in doing so",
    "the spin - dependences of the observed meson spectra played critical roles and it turned out that the magnitudes of spin splittings could not be easily accounted by perturbative calculations .",
    "a typical example is the mass difference between @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are taken to be the spin singlet and triplet states of isotriplet combination of up and down quarks .",
    "this example clearly shows the problem of definition of quark mass generating different viewpoints between current quark mass and constituent one .",
    "another example of changed name was @xmath9 and this state became @xmath16 in 1988 particle data .    in 1988 particle data , we have another five states @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xcite . of these @xmath18 became @xmath22 and @xmath20 was changed into @xmath23(2220 ) in 2002 particle data just before the discovery of @xmath1 in 2003 .",
    "the state @xmath17 was replaced by @xmath24 and @xmath19 became @xmath25 in 2002 particle data @xcite but both states disappeared after the discovery of @xmath1 .",
    "the state @xmath21 existed in 1974 as @xmath12 which had mass range overlapping with 1s and 1p states of charmonium system .",
    "the narrowness of the widths of these charmonium states prevented them to be checked as independent states at that time and the extension of the mass range from 2500 mev to 1900 mev could be related to the appearance of charmed particles .",
    "anyway only two @xmath0 particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 remained in 2002 particle data , but the name @xmath0 was assigned only to @xmath1 after its discovery . in 2004",
    "particle data , only one state @xmath1 was named as @xmath0 particle and the meaning of the assignment @xmath0 had been changed into the designation for non - quarkonium state @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 was discovered during the search for the 2p charmonium states and this state had been established since 2006 . in 2006 particle data @xcite ,",
    "one component of 2p charmonium state @xmath26 had been tabulated also and it was necessary to check whether the other components could be detected independently from the observed @xmath1 .",
    "these searches resulted in the report of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "two years later , @xmath27 had been changed into @xmath29 and @xmath28 became @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath27 had been found in the @xmath30 invariant mass distribution for exclusive b decays into @xmath31 by belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "but the state is still not established because of lack of confirmations by other experimental groups . on the other hand ,",
    "the state @xmath28 was found by babar collaboration in the invariant - mass spectrum of @xmath32 through the study of initial - state radiation events @xcite .",
    "this state had been established in the 2008 particle data .",
    "another state reported in 2006 particle data is @xmath33 .",
    "this state was observed by bes collaboration in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath34 pairs from radiative @xmath6 decays @xcite .",
    "the first suggestion to account for the decay channels was a @xmath34 baryonium which could be a tetraquark generator .",
    "however , other possibilities such as pseudoscalar glueball or radial excitation of @xmath35 had been considered also but the state could not be established because other groups could not confirm the existence of it . instead of confirmation of the same state , another state @xmath36 had been added to the 2014 particle data @xcite .    in 2008 particle data , two new state @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath4 had been reported and the state @xmath28 was changed into the established @xmath3 .",
    "the state @xmath37 appeared in 2010 particle data @xcite but disappeared after that .",
    "@xmath4 stayed as unestablished state for several years and finally became established one in 2014 particle data .",
    "similarly @xmath5 appeared in 2010 particle data and became established state in 2014 particle data .",
    "in addition there appeared many @xmath0 particles in 2010 particle data such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "these particles are not established as yet but the importance to analyze the spectra with respect to a given model is increased . in 2012 particle data @xcite ,",
    "three more @xmath0 particles @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 were added and the established state @xmath44 was assigned to @xmath47 state . finally , four more states @xmath36 , @xmath48 , @xmath2 , and @xmath49 were added to 2014 particle data and these are tabulated in table 1 according to their appearance in particle data .",
    ".10 @xmath89 states definitely assigned to each spin - orbit states of charmonium in the 2014 particle data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table:5 ]    states . now except for @xmath1 the remaining states have two possible @xmath89 assignments and we try to find out the best assignment by considering each combination of possible assignments .",
    "firstly , the state @xmath5 can be assigned to @xmath90 and @xmath91 states and we can compare these assignments by calculating @xmath92 . because the state @xmath1 can be overlapped on @xmath93 state with @xmath94 , we will consider these states later and the first comparison is carried out with only @xmath95 fixed at @xmath96 state .",
    "the results are shown in the first two rows of table [ table:6 ]  it turns out that @xmath5 is better suited to @xmath90 than @xmath91 , so we can fix @xmath5 as @xmath90 @xmath89 state .",
    "the next comparison is the assignments of @xmath97 and @xmath98 states to @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "these two cases are compared in the third and the forth rows of table [ table:6 ]   the case of @xmath97 to @xmath100 and @xmath98 to @xmath99 is excluded because @xmath92 exceeds 50 mev .",
    "therefore we can now fix @xmath99 to @xmath97 state and @xmath100 to @xmath98 state .",
    "another comparison is between the assignments of @xmath101 and @xmath102 states to @xmath4 and @xmath103 .",
    "these cases are classified according to the remaining assignments of @xmath104 and @xmath93 states to @xmath94 and @xmath1 .",
    "they are shown in the lower part of table [ table:6 ]  it turns out that @xmath4 is better suited to @xmath101 state and @xmath103 is naturally assigned to @xmath102 state . with these assignments",
    "the best fit to the observed states has @xmath105 not so different from the value @xmath106 with only 10 fixed states .",
    "the best fit includes @xmath94 as @xmath93 state and therefore @xmath1 can not be included in the spectra of charmonium states .",
    "we analyzed only five established @xmath0 particles .",
    "of these five @xmath0 particles , two @xmath0 particle @xmath1 and @xmath3 turn out to be non-@xmath89 states .",
    "however , there exist 18 @xmath0 particles in 2014 particle data and it seems impossible to explain them with quarkonium model .",
    "other possibilities such as hybrid states or tetraquark states have to be considered to account for these observed states . in order to check whether the other @xmath0 particles can be assigned to charmonium states or not , we need to repeat the above processes . but for the other unestablished @xmath0 particles it may be sufficient to compare with the calculated spectra like in table [ table:3 ]",
    "because we have obtained the best fit to the observed established states , it is necessary to recalculate the whole spectra with new parameters determined from the 17 states assigned to charmonium states .",
    "the new parameters are @xmath107 and the calculated results are shown in table [ table:7 ]",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the energy spectra of charmonium system by determining the parameters with least squares method .",
    "the determined quark mass turns out to be very large compared wirh the current quark mass deduced from the electroweak interactions .",
    "the difference results from gluonic interactions that increase with higher excited energies .",
    "the effect of large dynamical mass appears as reduction of spin splittings as they are proportional to the inverse square of quark mass .",
    "thus the largest difference between the calculated and the observed masses of @xmath108 can be ascribed to the large quark mass determined to fit all the observed data . moreover , for s - wave states , the probability of quark pair annihilation is not negligible and similar considerations lead to the introduction of vacuum condensate idea to predict the splittings between the triplet and the singlet states .",
    "the second state with large difference between the calculated and the observed masses is @xmath100 .",
    "this state is assigned to @xmath98 and it seems necessary to check the change of measured mass from the value around 4160 mev .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that the two established @xmath0 particle @xmath1 and @xmath3 can not be assigned to charmonium states .",
    "as is well known from the time of discovery , @xmath1 is considered to be a state of tetraquark .",
    "however , the calculation of energy states for 4-quark degree of freedom is not an easy one and the observed mass of @xmath1 is not quite different from the mass of @xmath93 charmonium state . in 2014 particle data , @xmath94 state",
    "is established and stays nearer to @xmath93 charmonium state than @xmath1 , but it is possible for @xmath94 to be assigned to @xmath104 state and then @xmath1 can be assigned to @xmath93 charmonium state .",
    "further study is needed by considering decay processes and state mixings to clarify the status of @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath3 is clearly excluded from the assignments to charmonium states and therefore it is plausible to check the calculations of tetraquark states to accommodate @xmath3 .",
    "another state to note is @xmath109 .",
    "this state was named as @xmath44 in 2012 particle data and established immediately after its discovery . however , the difference between the observed mass and the calculated mass in table 3 amounts to 56 mev .",
    "it may be possible to assign @xmath44 to @xmath110 charmonium state but the significant difference between the calculated and the observed masses could be taken to indicate other possibilities .",
    "other @xmath0 particles not discussed in this paper are still unestablished and we need to confirm these states with more experiments .",
    "peculiar examples are @xmath33 and @xmath36 . these states can not be assigned to any charmonium state and it is open to question whether they can be accounted as tetraquark state or as even more complex combination of mesons and baryons .",
    "two heavy @xmath0 particles @xmath45 and @xmath46 are thought to be some states containing bottom quark and we need to analyze bottomonium system",
    ".    in summary , now there exist so many @xmath0 particles that they can not be accommodated as quarkonium sates .",
    "of course some @xmath0 particles can be explained by quarkonium states but we need to introduce other possibilities such as tetraquark states , hybrids including gluonic degrees of freedom , and so on . in order to improve theoretical calculations",
    ", we need to rederive the form of gluon propagator in space - time coordinates to get rid of the divergence behavior at short distances .",
    "more systematic derivations of potential forms are also long - standing problems in strong interaction phenomena .",
    "further establishments of more @xmath0 particles may generate active researches on such subjects resulting in the quantitative understanding of strongly interacting bound systems .",
