    "eventually we will reach case ( i ) or subcase ( ii.1 ) .    finally , we would like to state the following problems .",
    "in  @xcite we saw that the problem of finding an integral vector in the intersection of the alternating cone with a box leads to the alternating reachability problem .",
    "we can ask a similar question for the trail cone , but with the integrality restriction dropped . given",
    "a 2-colored graph with nonnegative rational upper and lower bounds on the edges , is there an augmenting - path - type algorithm for either finding a rational vector in the trail cone satisfying these bounds , or showing that no such vector exists ?    in * @xcite",
    "* seymour makes the following conjecture for a graph @xmath0 : if @xmath515 , then @xmath56 is a sum of cycles , i.e , @xmath56 can be written as a nonnegative integer linear combination of characteristic vectors of cycles in @xmath1 .",
    "a vector in @xmath58 is a nonnegative rational combination of characteristic vectors of cycles , i.e. , is a fractional sum of cycles .",
    "so seymour s conjecture can be stated as follows : a fractional sum of cycles that is an even integer on every edge is a sum of cycles .",
