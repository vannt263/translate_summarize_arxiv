    "dynamics and dissipative properties of nuclear fermi liquid depend in many aspects on the dynamic distortion of the fermi surface in the momentum space .",
    "it is well - known that taking into account this distortion allows the description of a new class of phenomena , most famous of which are giant multipole resonances .",
    "furthermore , scattering of particles from the distorted fermi surface leads to relaxation of collective motion and gives rise to fluid viscosity @xcite .",
    "we point out that the development of instability in nuclear processes like binary fission or multifragmentation in hi - reactions also depends on dynamic effects such as the dynamic fermi - surface distortion .    a convenient way to introduce the fermi - liquid effects into the nuclear many body problem is to start from the kinetic equation for the phase space distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "the kinetic equation can then be transformed identically to a set ( infinite ) of equations for the moments of @xmath0 in @xmath1-space , namely , local single - particle density @xmath2 , the velocity field @xmath3 , the pressure tensor @xmath4 , etc . , see @xcite .",
    "in case of small variations of the particle density , @xmath5 , the first order moment of the kinetic equation has the form of euler - navier - stokes equation and is given by @xcite @xmath6 the internal energy density @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eiler ] ) contains both kinetic @xmath8 and potential @xmath9 energy densities : @xmath10 .",
    "the pressure tensor @xmath11 depends on the fermi - surface distortion effect . in general case",
    ", tensor @xmath11 also includes the viscosity tensor which is derived by the collision integral .",
    "( [ eiler ] ) is not closed because it contains the pressure tensor @xmath4 given by the second order moment of the distribution function @xmath0 .",
    "we will follow the nuclear fluid dynamic approach @xcite and take into account dynamic fermi - surface distortions up to the multipolarity of @xmath12 . assuming a periodic in time eigenvibrations with the eigenfrequency @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real , and a separable form of the velocity field , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ eiler ] ) is reduced to the equation of motion for the macroscopic variable @xmath18 with the following secular equation @xmath19 here , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass coefficient and the stiffness coefficient in the traditional liquid drop model ( ldm ) @xcite respectively . the additional contribution from @xmath22 to the stiffness coefficient and the dissipative term @xmath23",
    "depend on the relaxation time @xmath24 and are given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the equilibrium pressure of the fermi gas .",
    "the additional contribution from @xmath22 to the stiffness coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ 6.7 ] ) is absent in the ldm , i.e. in the liquid drop limit @xmath28 , and represents the influence of the dynamic fermi - surface distortion on the conservative forces in the fermi system .",
    "finally , the dissipative term @xmath23 appears due to the interparticle scattering from the distorted fermi surface .    in general , both , @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend implicitly on the temperature , @xmath31 , via the dependence of the relaxation time @xmath24 and of @xmath27 on @xmath31 . in cold nuclei , in the zero - sound limit @xmath32 , the main contribution to the stiffness coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ 6.7 ] ) is due to the fermi - surface distortion effect given by @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "1 , this effect is shown in a transparent way for isoscalar quadrupole excitations . as it is seen from this figure",
    ", the fermi - surface distortion effect leads to a significant upward shift of the energy of vibrational states to locate it in the region of the quadrupole giant resonance ( solid line ) .",
    "we will discuss the fermi - surface distortion effect in more detail for the case of isoscalar giant monopole resonances ( isgmr ) .",
    "this particular case is important for understanding the nature of nuclear incompressibility .",
    "we will consider below the model for a fermi - liquid drop having a sharp surface of the equilibrium radius @xmath34 and the bulk density @xmath35 .",
    "the particle density variation @xmath5 is then given by @xmath36 where the unknown functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are related to each other by the particle number conservation and the bulk density parameter @xmath37 is found from the equation of motion derived by eq .",
    "( [ eiler ] ) .",
    "namely , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the _ static _",
    "incompressibility @xmath41 the additional contribution @xmath42 to the incompressibility @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is due to the _ dynamic _ fermi - surface distortion effect @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath42 depends on the landau scattering amplitude @xmath44 . in nuclear case ,",
    "@xmath45 , one has @xmath46 .",
    "an essential property of a finite liquid drop having a free surface is that the motion of the surface should be consistent with the motion of the liquid inside the drop .",
    "this can be achieved by imposing a boundary condition for the compensation of the compressional pressure @xmath47 at the liquid surface by the pressure generated by the surface tension forces @xmath48 . finally , the eigenenergies in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 are derived from the following boundary condition : @xmath51 here the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related to the surface tension and the fermi - surface distortion respectively and are given by @xmath54 in the general case of fermi - liquid drop with @xmath55 , the eigenfrequency @xmath56 given in eq .",
    "( [ omn ] ) is renormalized due to two contributions associated with the fermi - surface distortion : 1 ) the direct change of the sound velocity , i.e. in eq .",
    "( [ omn ] ) @xmath43 appears instead of @xmath40 ; 2 ) the change of the roots @xmath57 of the secular equation ( [ sec ] ) due to additional contribution from @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ sec ] ) .",
    "these two effects work in opposite directions : @xmath43 increases @xmath56 while @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ sec ] ) decreases it .",
    "both values of @xmath43 and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ omn ] ) depend on the landau scattering amplitude @xmath44 . in the limit of zero- to first sound transition at @xmath58",
    ", one has @xmath59 and the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ sec ] ) and ( [ omn ] ) is close do the one obtained in ldm .",
    "however , for realistic nuclear forces @xmath45 , the general expressions ( [ sec])-([omn ] ) with @xmath55 have to be used .    in fig .",
    "2 we plotted the eigenenergy , @xmath60 , of the lowest monopole mode @xmath61 given by eqs .",
    "( [ omn ] ) and ( [ sec ] ) as a function of mass number @xmath62 .",
    "the dashed line shows the result for @xmath60 from eq .",
    "( [ omn ] ) where @xmath43 was replaced by @xmath63 and boundary condition ( [ sec ] ) with @xmath64 was used .",
    "the solid line shows the result of fldm calculations .",
    "we adopted the following expression for @xmath40 @xcite @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 and for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "so , in spite of strong renormalization of nuclear incompressibility due to the fermi - surface distortion effect , the energy of the giant monopole resonance @xmath60 in the fermi - liquid drop is located close to the one in the traditional ldm @xcite where the fermi - surface distortion effects are absent .",
    "the compensation of the fermi - surface distortion effect in nuclear incompressibility @xmath43 due to the consistent account of the same effect in the boundary condition ( [ sec ] ) is essential for the lowest mode @xmath70 only .",
    "the above mentioned compensation is rather small for the highest modes with @xmath71 . in particular",
    ", the eigenenergy of the double ( overtone ) giant monopole resonance @xmath72 ( in contrast to @xmath60 ) has a significant upward shift with respect to @xmath73 given by the traditional liquid drop model .",
    "the relaxation of nuclear collective motion toward thermal equilibrium has been described in great detail within the framework of the kinetic theory , taking into account the collision integral @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the collision integral @xmath74 depends on the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath75 . in case of a finite fermi system ,",
    "the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath75 , contains both the diffusive layer and oscillations in @xmath76-space which are caused by particle reflections at the potential surface .",
    "both of them depend on the distance @xmath77 .",
    "this fact also leads to the @xmath77-dependence of the collisional relaxation time , @xmath78 , given by @xmath79 the @xmath80-dependence of @xmath81 is due to the memory effects in the collision integral @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the collisional relaxation time @xmath78 in a finite fermi system requires additional accuracy .",
    "the diffusive layer in the equilibrium distribution function in momentum space can lead to a spurious effect in non - zero gain- and loss fluxes of the probability in the ground state of the fermi system .",
    "however , it can be shown , see ref .",
    "@xcite , that the general condition for the disappearance of both above mentioned fluxes is reached due to the occurrence of quantum oscillations in the equilibrium distribution function @xmath75 in momentum space .",
    "the @xmath77-dependent diffusive tail of the distribution function in momentum space leads to an increase of the collisional damping of the collective motion in the surface region of a nucleus and thus to an increase of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( gqr ) width . however , this increase is strongly reduced due to the above mentioned oscillations of the equilibrium distribution functions appearing in the collision integral . as a result",
    ", the collisional width of the isoscalar gqr does not exceed 30 - 50% of the experimental value and agrees with the estimates of the width where the sharp thomas - fermi distribution function is used @xcite .    in the case of heated nuclei ,",
    "both temperature and memory effects have to be taken into account in the collision integral . for frequencies small",
    "compared to the fermi energy , one finds @xcite : @xmath82/ \\tilde{\\tau}_{2 } , \\label{3.20}\\ ] ] which is valid for @xmath83 and when sharp thomas - fermi distribution for @xmath75 is assumed .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath84 can be given in the following general form at low temperatures @xmath85 @xcite @xmath86 where the quantity @xmath87 is for the isoscalar mode and @xmath88 is for the isovector mode : @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "in general , there are several contributions to the relaxation time @xmath24 .",
    "the main contribution @xmath90 arises from the above discussed interparticle collisions and the other from collisions of nucleons with the moving nuclear surface ( one - body dissipation with relaxation time @xmath91 )",
    ". we will also include the contribution from particle emission with relaxation time @xmath92 .",
    "thus , @xmath93 introduction of the one - body dissipation reflects the peculiarities of our consideration , namely , restricting fermi - surface distortions to the multipolarity @xmath94 does not allow us to take into consideration landau damping ( fragmentation width ) .",
    "the total width , @xmath15 , of a collective state can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) with @xmath90 replaced by the total relaxation time @xmath24 from eq .",
    "( [ 3.12 ] ) . assuming sharp nuclear surface , the total width @xmath15 is reduced to the following form , see ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the first sound velocity in nuclear matter .",
    "we want to note that the total intrinsic width given by eq .",
    "( [ 3.10 ] ) has a bell - shaped form as a function of @xmath98 .",
    "the width @xmath99 is peaked around @xmath100 and the maximum value of @xmath15 is @xmath101 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath102 represents the crossing point of both curves @xmath103 ( zero sound regime ) and @xmath104 ( first sound regime ) . due to this fact",
    "the condition @xmath105 can be used as the condition for the transition from long to short relaxation time regimes .",
    "the magnitude of the intrinsic width @xmath99 decreases when the parameter @xmath106 exceeds @xmath102 .",
    "we have @xmath107 for the isovector gdr at the realistic value of @xmath108 .",
    "such a value of @xmath106 can be reached at the temperature @xmath109 , see eq .",
    "( [ 3.20 ] ) . if the relation ( [ 4.4 ] ) with @xmath110 and @xmath111 is used as the condition for transition between different regimes of sound wave propagation then the transition between both regimes occurs at the higher temperature @xmath112 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the intrinsic width of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in the nucleus @xmath113_sn_. as it is seen from fig .",
    "3 , the expression ( [ 3.10 ] ) ( solid line ) leads to a smoother behaviour of the total intrinsic width with increasing excitation energy as compared to the prediction of the zero - sound regime given by the following condition : @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( dashed line ) .",
    "our calculation of the intrinsic width @xmath15 for the isovector gdr in the hot nucleus @xmath113_sn _ confirms a saturation effect in the energy dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "however , we observe a systematic deviation of the evaluated width with respect to experimental values . this deviation can be reduced by varying the parameter @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ 3.10 ] ) .",
    "an increase in the parameter @xmath117 improves agreement with the experiment ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "in the vicinity of the equilibrium state of the nuclear fermi - liquid drop the stiffness coefficients for particle density and surface changes are positive and the nucleus is stable with respect to the corresponding distortions .",
    "with decreasing bulk density or increasing internal excitation energy ( temperature ) the liquid drop reaches regions of mechanical or thermodynamical instabilities with respect to the small particle density and experiences shape fluctuations and separation into liquid and gas phases .",
    "let us consider small density fluctuations @xmath118 starting from eq .",
    "( [ eiler ] ) . we will use a simple saturated equation of state @xmath119 = { \\cal e}_{kin}[\\rho ] + { \\cal e}_{pot}[\\rho ] $ ] with @xmath120 = { \\hbar^2\\over 2\\,m}\\ , \\left[{3\\over 5}\\,\\big({3\\pi^2\\over 2}\\big)^{2/3 } \\,\\rho^{5/3 } + { 1\\over 4}\\,\\eta \\,{(\\vec{\\nabla}\\rho)^2\\over \\rho}\\right],\\,\\,\\,\\ ] ] @xmath121 @xmath122 = t_0\\,\\rho^2 + t_3\\,\\rho^3 + t_s\\,(\\vec{\\nabla}\\rho)^2 + \\epsilon_c[\\rho ] .\\ ] ] the potential energy @xmath123 $ ] has a skyrme - type form including the surface term @xmath124 and the coulomb energy density , @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "we will again assume a sharp surface behaviour of the equilibrium particle density .",
    "assuming also @xmath126 and taking into account continuity equation and eq .",
    "( [ epot ] ) , the equation of motion ( [ eiler ] ) can be reduced to the following form ( we consider the isoscalar mode ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath40 is the incompressibility coefficient @xmath130    let us consider volume instability regime , @xmath131 , and introduce the growth rate @xmath132 ( @xmath15 is real , @xmath133 ) . using eq .",
    "( [ 0eq3 ] ) , one obtains @xmath134 where @xmath135 the quantity @xmath136 in eq .",
    "( [ 0disp ] ) appears due to the fermi surface distortion effect .",
    "equation ( [ 0disp ] ) is valid for arbitrary relaxation times @xmath24 and thus describes both rare and frequent collision limits as well as intermediate cases . from it",
    "one can obtain the leading order terms in the different limits mentioned .    _",
    "( i ) frequent collision regime : @xmath137 .",
    "high temperatures . _",
    "+ the contribution from the dynamic distortion of the fermi surface , @xmath138 , can be neglected in this case and we have from eqs .",
    "( [ 0disp ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the classical friction coefficient . in the limit of small friction , we obtain @xmath141    the amplitude of the density oscillations with a certain multipolarity @xmath142 , @xmath143 , grows exponentially if @xmath133 . the expression ( [ 0disp2 ] ) determines two characteristic values of the wave number @xmath144 , namely , @xmath145 and @xmath146 where the growth rate reaches the maximum of magnitude @xmath147 and @xmath15 goes to zero ( excluding @xmath148 ) respectively , i.e. , @xmath149 both @xmath145 and @xmath146 are given by @xmath150    for a saturated nuclear liquid , one has @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "thus , the critical value @xmath146 from eq .",
    "( [ crit ] ) increases with a decrease of the bulk density @xmath35 , see eqs .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ crit ] ) .",
    "the presence of friction decreases the critical value @xmath146 , i.e. reduces the instability .",
    "the existence of the critical wave number @xmath146 for an unstable mode is a feature of a finite system .",
    "the growth rate @xmath15 depends on the multipolarity @xmath142 of the nuclear density distortion and on the position of @xmath153 in the interval @xmath154 @xcite .",
