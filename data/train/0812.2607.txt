    "it is generally inferred from observations that the matter falling onto black holes is of very high temperature , both in microquasars @xcite as well as in agns @xcite . the electron temperature around 10@xmath0 k and/or the proton temperature around 10@xmath1 k or more",
    "are accepted as typical values within few tens of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath2 , of the central black holes . moreover",
    ", the general theory of relativity demands that the matter crosses the black hole horizon with the speed of light ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in other words , close to black holes , the matter is relativistic in terms of its bulk speed and/or its temperature . on the other hand , at large distances away from black holes , the matter should be non - relativistic .",
    "it is also inferred from observations that the astrophysical jets around black hole candidates have relativistic speeds @xcite .",
    "since the jets originate from the accreting matter very close to black holes , their base could be very hot . at a few hundred schwarzschild radii above the disc plane",
    ", they can expand to very low temperatures but very high speeds ( lorentz factor @xmath4 a few ) . and",
    "as the fast moving matter of the jets hits the ambient medium and drastically slows down to form shocks and hot spots , once again the thermal energy increases to relativistic values though the bulk velocity becomes small .",
    "relativistic flows are inferred for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) too . in the so - called collapsar model scenario @xcite , the collimated bipolar outflows emerge from deep inside collapsars and propagate into the interstellar medium , producing grbs and afterglows . in such model , these collimated outflows are supposed to achieve lorentz factors @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear in the above examples that as a fluid flows onto a black hole or away from it , there are one or more transitions from the non - relativistic regime to the relativistic one or vice - versa .",
    "it has been shown by quite a few authors that to describe such trans - relativistic fluid , the equation of state ( eos ) with a fixed adiabatic index @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , the ratio of specific heats ) is inadequate and the relativistically correct eos @xcite should be used @xcite .",
    "a fluid is said to be thermally relativistic , if its thermal energy is comparable to or greater than its rest mass energy , if @xmath8 .",
    "the thermally non - relativistic regime is @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 is the temperature , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath12 is the mass of the particles that constitute the fluid .",
    "so it is not just the temperature that determines a fluid to be thermally relativistic , but it is the ratio , @xmath13 , that determines it .",
    "therefore , together with the temperature , the composition of the fluid ( either the fluid is composed of electron - positron pairs , or electrons and protons , or some other combinations ) will determine whether the fluid is in the thermally relativistic regime or not .",
    "the study of relativistic flows around compact objects including black holes was started by @xcite .",
    "it was basically recasting the transonic accretion and wind solutions around newtonian objects obtained by @xcite into the framework of the general theory of relativity .",
    "since then , a number of authors have addressed the problem of relativistic flows around black holes , each focusing on its various aspects @xcite .",
    "barring a few exceptions @xcite , most of these studies used the eos with a fixed @xmath14 , which , as we have noted , is incapable of describing a fluid from infinity to the horizon .",
    "@xcite for the first time calculated the spherical accretion and wind solutions around schwarzschild black holes , while using an approximate eos for the single - component relativistic fluid @xcite .",
    "@xcite modified the eos used by @xcite to obtain thermally driven spherical winds with relativistic terminal speeds .",
    "however , there has been no extensive study of the effects of fluid composition on the solutions of transonic flows around black holes .",
    "we in this paper investigate the effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the governing equations including the eos . in section 3",
    ", we present the sonic point properties . in section 4",
    ", we present the accretion and wind solutions . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the validity of our relativistic eos .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks are presented in the last section .",
    "to ensure that the effects of fluid composition are clearly presented , we keep our model of accretion and wind as simple as possible .",
    "we consider adiabatic , spherical flows onto schwarzschild black holes .",
    "the space time is described by the schwarzschild metric @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the usual spherical coordinates , @xmath19 is the time , and @xmath20 is the mass of the central black hole .",
    "although agns and micro - quasars are in general powered by rotating flows , studies of spherical flows are not entirely of pedagogic interest .",
    "for instance , such studies can throw light on the nature of accretions onto isolated black holes in low angular momentum and cold clouds .",
    "in addition , hot spherical flows may mimic accretions very close to black holes , where the accreting matter is expected to be of low angular momentum , hot , and with strong advection .",
    "non - conservative processes and magnetic fields are ignored , too .",

    "the equations governing fluid dynamics are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the particle number density of the fluid measured in the local frame .",

    "for multi - component fluids , however , not just the temperature , the mass of the constituent particles also determines the thermal state .",
    "hence , the proton proportion , @xmath59 , enters as a parameter too .    in figure 1",

    "@xmath54 decreases ( the fluid becomes less relativistic ) with the increase of @xmath59 .",

    "it is not the thermal energy , but the competition between the thermal energy and the rest mass energy that makes a fluid relativistic .",

    "both the acceleration and wind flows accelerate at the sonic point . on the other hand , in the d - type , only the accretion flows accelerate , while the wind flows decelerate at the sonic point .    by substituting the quantities at the sonic point , equations ( 7b )",

    "combining equation ( 8b ) and ( 5k ) gives @xmath102 in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath59 .",

    "if @xmath101 and @xmath59 are given , then @xmath83 is computed from the formula .",
    "once @xmath83 is known , all the quantities at @xmath83 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath87 , @xmath104 , etc , are computed from equations ( 8a )  ( 8h ) . then equations ( 7a ) and ( 7b )",
    "are integrated , starting from @xmath83 , once inwards and then outwards , to obtain the global , transonic solutions of spherical flows around black holes . by this way",
    ", we can obtain two parameter ( @xmath101 , @xmath59 ) family of accretion and wind solutions .",
    "in the transonic flows we study , the sonic point plays an important role .",
    "so before we present global solutions in the next section , we first investigate the properties of the sonic point in this section .",
    "understanding the sonic - point properties will allow us to have an idea of the nature of global flow structures .",
    "the sonic point location , @xmath83 , that is computed as a function of @xmath101 and @xmath59 , is presented in figure 2a .",
    "corresponding to each set of @xmath101 and @xmath59 values , there exists a unique @xmath83 .",
    "each curve , which is given as a function of @xmath101 , is for a different value of @xmath59 .",
    "if a flow is more energetic with larger @xmath101 , it is characterized by a smaller value of @xmath83 . however , at the same @xmath101 , @xmath83 is smallest for the @xmath61 fluid ( solid line ) .",
    "the value of @xmath83 increases for @xmath67 , and then starts to decrease for larger @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , if fluids of the same @xmath101 but different @xmath59 are launched at a large distance away from a black hole , then the @xmath61 fluid crosses the sonic point closest to the event horizon , compared to the fluids of finite proton proportion . alternatively , at the same @xmath83 , @xmath101 is smallest for the @xmath61 fluid , and it increases up to @xmath105 and then decreases for @xmath106 .",
    "although for the same @xmath83 the @xmath63 ( dotted line ) is not most energetic , it is definitely more energetic than the @xmath61 fluid .",
    "since fluids of different composition are energetically quite different at the same @xmath83 , or conversely fluids of different composition but the same @xmath101 form the sonic point at widely different @xmath83 , it is expected that the global solutions of accretion and wind flows would be quantitatively and qualitatively different , depending upon the composition of fluids .    in figures 2b and 2c",
    ", we show @xmath107 and @xmath108 as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "equations ( 8b ) tells that the sound speed at the sonic point , @xmath109 , is fixed , once @xmath83 is determined ( @xmath109 implicitly depends on @xmath101 and @xmath59 through @xmath83 ) .",
    "so plotting any variable as a function of @xmath83 is equivalent to plotting it as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "as noted above , at the same @xmath109 , fluids composed of lighter particles are colder .",
    "therefore , in figure 2b , at the same @xmath83 , the temperature is lowest for the @xmath61 fluid , and progressively gets higher for fluids with larger proton proportions , and the maximum temperature is for the @xmath63 fluid .",
    "however , as noted before , higher @xmath107 does not necessarily ensure higher @xmath108 ( more relativistic fluids ) . in figure 2c , at the same @xmath83 , the @xmath61 fluid has the lowest @xmath108 , that is , it is least relativistic . in the range of a few @xmath110 , at the same @xmath83 , @xmath108 increases as the proton proportion increases for @xmath111 , and then starts to decrease for @xmath112 .",
    "this is a consequence of the competition between the thermal energy and the rest mass energy , as discussed in connection with figures 1c . in order to make the point even clearer , in figure 2d ,",
    "we show @xmath108 as a function of @xmath59 for a wide range of values of @xmath83 .",
    "each curve with a single value of @xmath83 signifies fluids of different composition but the same sound speed at the same sonic point .",
    "@xmath108 tends to peak at some values of @xmath59 , where the thermal contribution with respect to the rest mass energy contribution peaks . for small values of @xmath83 ( large @xmath109 s ) ,",
    "a small increase of @xmath59 causes the thermal contribution to peak . for large values of @xmath83 ( small @xmath109 s )",
    ", large proton proportions are needed to achieve the same .    as discussed in section 2.3 , the roots of equation ( 8d ) are either of the a - type or of the d - type . at small values of @xmath83 ,",
    "the nature of the sonic point is of the a - type .",
    "it is because if the sonic point form closer to the central object , the flow is hotter at the sonic point ( figure 2b ) , and in the wind that is thermally driven , the flow tends to accelerate at the sonic point .",
    "but beyond a limiting value , say @xmath113 , the nature changes from the a - type to the d - type , where the wind flow decelerates at the sonic point . in figure 3a",
    ", @xmath113 is plotted as a function of @xmath59 . since at a given @xmath83",
    "the @xmath61 fluid is thermally least relativistic , @xmath113 is smallest for the fluid .",
    "the limit @xmath113 increases with @xmath59 .",
    "however , since increasing @xmath59 makes fluids ` heavy ' too , @xmath113 peaks around @xmath114 . in figure 3b ,",
    "we plot the limiting values of @xmath101 corresponding to @xmath113 , @xmath115 , as a function of @xmath59 , such that for @xmath116 the nature of the sonic point is of the a - type , for @xmath117 it is of the d - type .",
    "in this section , we present the global solutions of equations ( 7a  7b ) that were obtained with the procedure described in section 2.4 . in figure 4 , we first compare typical accretion and wind solutions of the a and d - types for the @xmath61 fluid . the solutions of the a - type in the left panels have the sonic point at @xmath118 , inside @xmath113 , while those of the d - type in the right panels have @xmath119 , beyond @xmath113 ( figure 3a ) . the accretion solutions ( solid curves )",
    "are characterized by supersonic flows at the inner boundary and subsonic flows at the outer boundary ( figures 4c and 4d ) . the wind solutions ( dotted curves ) ,",
    "on the other hand , have subsonic flows at the inner boundary and supersonic flows at the outer boundary .",
    "the accretion flows around black holes necessarily accelerate inwards .",

    "the wind solutions considered in this paper are thermally driven .",
    "these winds are very hot at the base , and are powered by the conversion of the thermal energy into the kinetic energy",

    "similar relation between the gradients at the sonic point will determine the nature of the sonic point .",
    "it may be noted that at @xmath125 ( figures 3a and 3b ) , such relation between @xmath126 and @xmath127 is satisfied .",
    "regardless of accretion / wind or the type , the temperature decreases with increasing @xmath16 ( figures 4e and 4f ) .",
    "we note that the winds in our solutions are too weak to be the precursor of astrophysical jets , until and unless other accelerating processes like those caused by magnetic fields or disc radiation are considered @xcite .",
    "in fact , we checked that it is not possible to generate the terminal speed much greater than @xmath128 for purely thermally driven winds , such as the ones that are considered in this paper .",
    "it is also to be noted that our d - type , wind solution is not an example of ` breeze ' .",
    "a breeze is always subsonic , while the wind here is transonic , albeit decelerating .    in the previous figure , we have compared the solutions with the same @xmath59 (= 0 ) but different @xmath83 . in figure 5 , we compare the solutions with the same @xmath83 (= 20 ) but different @xmath59 . as shown in figure 2a , even for the same @xmath83 ,",
    "the specific energy is different for fluids of different @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the polytropic index at the sonic point is different too ( @xmath129 in figure 5a , @xmath130 in figure 5b , and @xmath131 in figure 5c ) .",
    "therefore , even if we fix the sonic point ( and therefore @xmath109 ) , the flow structure and energetics are different for fluids with different @xmath59 . in these particular solutions ,",
    "the @xmath61 fluid is not hot enough to drive an accelerating wind ( figure 5a ) , while the fluids with significant protons can do so . as in the previous case of decelerating wind solution ( figure 4b ) , in the present case",
    "the @xmath61 fluid first accelerates and then starts to decelerate at @xmath132 .",
    "the velocity profile eventually tapers off to an asymptotic value at large distances away from the black hole .",
    "it has been shown in figure 2b that at the same @xmath83 , adding protons increases the temperature at the sonic point .",
    "larger temperature gradient causes winds of finite proton proportion to be accelerated at the sonic point ( figure 5b ) .",
    "it is seen that beyond a critical value , the increase in @xmath59 increases the inertia which reduces the wind speed , as is vindicated by figures 5b and 5c .",
    "it is to be remembered that , the d type sonic point is a reality for fluids of any @xmath59 , provided @xmath133 .",
    "although the wind solutions are noticeably different depending on @xmath59 , there seems to be only small difference in the velocity profile of the accretion solutions . henceforth , we concentrate only on accretion solutions . such small difference in @xmath134 in accretion solutions",
    "is expected .",
    "the accretion is generated mostly by the inward pull of the gravity , which gives the unique inner boundary condition for black holes , @xmath135 at @xmath136 , regardless of other considerations .",
    "the pressure gradient changes the profile of @xmath134 too .",
    "since the composition of fluids determines the thermal state , it influences the profile of @xmath134 , but the effect is not the dominant one .    in figure 6 , we compare the accretion solutions with the same @xmath101 (= 1.015 ) but different @xmath59 . as noted below equation ( 9 ) ,",
    "@xmath101 is a constant of motion . for @xmath137 , as @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 , where @xmath140_{\\infty } = \\left[\\frac{f+2\\theta}{2-\\xi+\\xi/\\eta}\\right]_{\\infty } % \\eqno{(11)}\\ ] ] is the specific enthalpy at infinity . equation ( 11 ) tells us that at large distances from black holes , for the same @xmath101 , @xmath10 is large if @xmath59 is large .",
    "hence , fluids with larger @xmath59 are hotter to start with . therefore even for fluids with the same @xmath101 , the solutions are different if @xmath59 is different .",
    "figure 6a shows the velocity profile as a function of @xmath16 . here , the difference in @xmath134 for fluids with different @xmath59 is evident , albeit not big as pointed above .",

    "we need to supply the mass accretion rate , which is given as @xmath141 from equation ( 6c ) .",
    "the mass density in figure 6b was computed for @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the eddington rate of accretion .",

    "the @xmath63 fluid is more relativistic than the @xmath61 fluid .",
    "but the most relativistic fluid is the one with the intermediate value of @xmath59 .",
    "it is interesting to note that except for the @xmath61 fluid , @xmath54 is a slowly varying function of @xmath16 for the other two fluids .",
    "does this mean it would be sufficient to adopt the fixed @xmath14 eos with appropriate values of @xmath6 ?    finally in figure 7",
    ", we compare the accretion solutions with the same temperature at large distances but different @xmath59 .",
    "all the fluids start with @xmath146 k at @xmath147 .",
    "again the mass density was computed for @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "it is to be noted that the fluids starting with the same @xmath148 but different @xmath59 have different specific energies .",
    "hence , the velocity at the outer boundary is different too . as shown in figure 7a , in these particular solutions , the @xmath61 fluid starts with a velocity substantially different from those of the other two fluids , so the resulting velocity profile is substantially different . from figure 7d , it is clear that there are significant variations in @xmath54 for all the fluids .",
    "the @xmath61 fluid starts with the largest @xmath54 .",
    "it is because at the same temperature , the @xmath61 fluid is thermally most relativistic .",
    "the behavior of @xmath54 can be traced back to figure 1a .",
    "for instance , the variations in @xmath54 tend to flatten at @xmath149 k. in figure 7c , for the fluids with @xmath150 and 1 , @xmath151 k for @xmath152 and @xmath149 k for @xmath153 .",
    "so significant variations are expected in @xmath54 at @xmath154 , while the variations flatten at @xmath155 .",
    "similar considerations will explain the variations in @xmath54 for the @xmath61 fluid . from figure 7d",
    ", it is clear that we need to adopt a relativistically correct eos [ equation ( 4c ) or ( 4d ) ] , instead of the eos with a fixed @xmath6 , in order to capture the proper thermal properties of flows around black holes .    in this section",
    ", we have shown that fluids with different composition can result in dramatically different accretion and wind flows , even if they have the same sonic point or the same specific energy , or they start with the same temperature at large distances from black holes .",
    "so not just adopting a correct eos , but incorporating the effects of fluid composition into the eos ( see equation 5e ) should be also important in describing such flows .",
    "in section 2 , we have made the following assumptions for our eos ( equation 5e ) ; fluids are in equilibrium , 1 ) the distribution of the constituent particles is relativistically maxwellian and 2 ) the multi - components are of single temperature .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the conditions are satisfied .",
    "most astrophysical fluids , unlike the terrestrial ones , consist of charged particles , which are _ collisionless _ , and so held together by magnetic fields .",
    "the constituent particles , on the other hand , exchange energies , and become relaxed mostly through the coulomb interaction , which is a slow process in collisionless plasmas .",
    "in addition , most of the heating processes , such as viscosity and shock heating , are likely to affect protons .",
    "however , it is mainly the electrons which radiate .",
    "so the energy exchange between electrons and protons should operate , and eventually govern the thermal properties of fluids .",
    "let @xmath156 be the electron - electron relaxation time scale , @xmath157 be the proton - proton relaxation time scale , and @xmath158 be the electron - proton relaxation time scale . and",
    "let @xmath159 be the time scale of problem , such as the dynamical time scale , or the heating and/or cooling time scale . only if @xmath160 and @xmath161 , electrons and protons will separately attain the maxwellian distributions . and only if @xmath162 , electrons and protons will relax to single temperature .",
    "to verify the assumptions for our eos , in this section , we compare the relaxation time scales with the dynamical or accretion time scale ( @xmath163 ) for an accretion solution .",
    "we consider the temperature range where protons are thermally non - relativistic while electrons are relativistic . in most our solutions in the previous section",
    ", the computed temperature favors this range .",
    "the relativistic electron - electron interaction time scale was derived by @xcite ,    @xmath164    the time scale for the non - relativistic proton - proton interaction is given in @xcite , @xmath165 the relativistic electron - proton interaction time scale was also derived by @xcite , @xmath166    we present the electron number density , @xmath35 ( figure 8a ) , the three velocity @xmath134 ( figure 8b ) and the temperature @xmath10 ( figure 8c ) of the accretion solution for the @xmath63 fluid with @xmath167 .",
    "the electron number density was computed for @xmath142 and @xmath143 . in figure 8d ,",
    "various time scales are compared .",
    "all the relaxation time scales were calculated for the solution of single - temperature . to our surprise , it is clear that the accretion flow in the figure is ` too fast ' , such that various relaxation time scales are longer than the accretion time scale at least within few tens of @xmath2 . the implication of it is not clear , however .",
    "for instance , in relativistic plasmas , the constituent particles can be relaxed through the interactions with magnetic fields , too .",
    "but the relaxation will depend on the details of field configuration , such as the strength and the topology .",
    "since we ignore in this study magnetic fields as well as other processes such as non - conservative ones , we leave this issue of the validity of our eos for future studies .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the effects of fluid composition on the solutions of accretion and wind flows onto black holes . in order to elucidate the effects ,",
    "we have considered a very simple model of spherical flows onto schwarzschild black holes , and non - conservative processes and magnetic fields have been ignored .",
    "first , we have suggested an approximate eos for multi - component fluids in equation ( 5e ) , and studied the thermal properties of fluids with the eos .",
    "three temperature ranges have been categorized ; for @xmath168 , any type of fluids are thermally non - relativistic , for @xmath169 , any type of fluids are thermally relativistic , and for @xmath66 , the degree to which fluids are relativistic is determined by the composition of the fluids as well as the temperature ( figure 1a ) .",
    "then we have shown that although at the same temperature the @xmath61 fluid is most relativistic ( figure 1a ) , at the same sound speed it is least relativistic ( figure 1c ) , compared to the fluids with protons .",
    "it is because whether a fluid is relativistic or not depends on the competition between the thermal energy and the rest mass energy of the fluid .",
    "the thermal properties of fluids carry to the sonic point properties . the sound speed at the sonic point",
    ", @xmath109 , explicitly depends only on the sonic point location , @xmath83 ( it implicitly depends on the specific energy , @xmath101 , and the proton proportion , @xmath59 , through @xmath83 ) .",
    "therefore , comparing the thermodynamic quantities at the same @xmath83 is equivalent to comparing those quantities at the same @xmath109 .",
    "we have shown that at the same @xmath83 , the @xmath61 fluid is least relativistic , and a fluid with a finite @xmath59 is most relativistic ( figures 2c and 2d ) .",
    "then , we have presented the global solutions of accretion and wind flows for the same @xmath83 but different @xmath59 , for the same @xmath101 but different @xmath59 , and for the same @xmath10 at large distances from black holes but different @xmath59 . in all the cases , the flows can be dramatically different , if the composition is different .",
    "this asserts that the effects of fluid composition are important in the solutions , and hence , incorporating them properly into the solutions through the eos is important .",
    "lastly , we have noted that the eos in equation ( 5e ) is based on the assumptions that the distribution of the constituent particles is relativistically maxwellian and the multi - components are of single temperature .",
    "however , at the same time , we have pointed out that while the coulomb relaxation times are normally shorter than the dynamical time far away from black holes , close to black holes they can be longer .",
    "it means that close to black holes , the assumptions for the eos can be potentially invalidated .",
    "the implication of it needs to be understood , and we leave further consideration of this issue for future studies .",
