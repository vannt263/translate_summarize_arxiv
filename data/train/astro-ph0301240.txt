    "the atmospheric erenkov technique has become an increasingly mature experimental method of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath2-ray astronomy in the recent years @xcite .",
    "major effort has gone into the optimization of @xmath2-hadron separation@xcite , the energy calibration , energy resolution @xcite and the evaluation of spectra of @xmath2-ray sources . both imaging and non - imaging techniques play an increasingly important role in measuring the precise spectra of @xmath3-ray sources over a wide energy range @xcite . among the non - imaging telescopes",
    "are the detector arrays based on solar concentrators like the celeste , graal and stacee have the potential to achieve unprecedented low energy thresholds for ground based @xmath2-ray detectors @xcite .",
    "the imaging technique is also evolving with several large ( 10 @xmath4 class ) imaging telescopes forming a stereoscopic array to achieve unprecedented angular resolution @xmath5 hess@xcite , veritas@xcite .",
    "these are currently under development .",
    "a single large imaging telescope ( 17 @xmath4 diameter ) is also under development which could achieve the lowest ever threshold of @xmath6 for primary @xmath2-rays @xcite .",
    "however , there has been a major difficulty in applying the atmospheric erenkov technique successfully for @xmath7 ray astronomy .",
    "the abundant charged cosmic ray particles generate erenkov light akin to that produced by the @xmath7 rays as a result of which the @xmath7 ray signal is buried in a vast sea of cosmic ray background .",
    "accurate location of the direction from which the primary particle is incident at the top of the atmosphere has been an important feature of successful observations since hadronic showers are isotropic .",
    "this has been the motivation to develop very good angular resolution capabilities @xcite .",
    "but since @xmath8-ray sources are weak one needs additional methods to reject the on - axis hadronic showers from the data .",
    "such techniques have been developed for imaging telescopes @xcite while they are still being developed for non - imaging telescope arrays @xcite .",
    "the best distinction between @xmath8-ray and proton showers should be based on an ideal parameter that does not show large deviations from its mean value @xmath9 it has a narrow distribution , and also whose fitted @xmath8-ray curve should be well separated from the corresponding one for the hadronic showers .",
    "often this is hardly achievable by using a single parameter and one often uses two or more parameters in tandem @xcite or simultaneously uses several parameters together with their correlations @xcite to achieve the same goal .",
    "major difficulty is that these parameters often vary with primary energy and core distance , hence the separability too .",
    "methods for the efficient discrimination of photon and hadron initiated showers have been derived from the differences in the intrinsic properties of the erenkov radiation from pure electromagnetic and hadronic cascades .",
    "differences manifest in the spatial as well as temporal distributions of the erenkov photons at the observation level . as a result ,",
    "systematic studies of these photons as received at the observation level could lead to the development of techniques to distinguish between hadronic or photon primaries .",
    "there are several atmospheric erenkov arrays designed precisely to apply these techniques to ground based vhe @xmath7 ray astronomy @xcite .",
    "the technique of separating proton or heavy nuclei initiated showers from @xmath8-ray initiated showers was successfully developed first using atmospheric erenkov images @xcite .",
    "a new method is based on the image surface brightness which seems to change with primary energy and species .",
    "this shows the importance of the photometric information of erenkov images in addition to the image shape parameters @xcite demonstrating that the photon densities too contain species dependent signature .",
    "more recently , a method based on the differences in the fluctuations of light intensity in the images of showers initiated by @xmath8-rays and cosmic ray hadrons has been developed to offer additional background rejection capability @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we similarly explore a new discrimination technique from a study of the spatial profile of erenkov light brightness from pure electromagnetic cascades as well as hadronic cascades generated by very high energy primaries .",
    "the technique is based on the differences in the intrinsic fluctuations in the erenkov photon densities at the observation level produced in the pure electromagnetic and hadronic cascades .",
    "the photon density fluctuations are classified in terms of their spatial extent , _",
    "i.e. _ ` short ' , ` medium ' and ` long ' range and then parameterized .",
    "we then investigate the sensitivity of these three basic parameters to primary species .",
    "the relative merits of these parameters are compared in terms of the quality factors which are indicators of the efficiency with which showers of hadronic origin could be rejected in order to improve the signal to noise ratio of the data .    in  2 of this paper , details of simulations",
    "are given , followed by the definition of the figure of merit for discrimination between @xmath0 rays and cosmic rays in  3 . in  4 , we define the three different parameters based on relative photon density fluctuations and study their core distance dependences",
    ". then we present the quality factors derived for each of the parameters for various primary energies .",
    "the dependence of the quality factors on the telescope opening angle and incident angle of the primary at the top of the atmosphere are discussed in ",
    "s 5 & 6 respectively",
    ". the  7 contains results on the species dependence of the quality factors .",
    "a brief discussion of the results is presented in  8 and conclusions are summarized in  9 .",
    "corsika ( version 5.60 ) , @xcite has been used to simulate erenkov light emission in the earth s atmosphere by the secondaries of the extensive air showers generated by cosmic ray primaries or @xmath0 rays .",
    "this program simulates interactions of nuclei , hadrons , muons , electrons and photons as well as decays of unstable secondaries in the atmosphere .",
    "it uses egs4 code @xcite for the electromagnetic component of the air shower simulation and the dual parton model for the simulation of hadronic interactions at @xmath10 energies .",
    "the erenkov radiation produced within the specified band width ( 300 - 650 @xmath11 ) by the charged secondaries is propagated to the ground .",
    "the us standard atmosphere parameterized by linsley @xcite has been used .",
    "the position , angle , time ( with respect to the first interaction ) and production height of each photon hitting the detector on the observation level are recorded .    in the present studies",
    "we have used pachmarhi ( longitude : 78@xmath12 26@xmath13 e , latitude : 22@xmath12 28@xmath14 and altitude : 1075 @xmath4 ) as the observation level where an array of erenkov detectors each of area deployed par - axially on a single equatorial mount . ]",
    "4.35 @xmath15 is deployed in the form of a rectangular array .",
    "we have assumed 17 detectors in the e - w direction with a separation of 25 @xmath4 and 21 detectors in the n - s direction with a separation of 20 m , making a total of 357 detectors deployed over an area of @xmath16 .",
    "this configuration , similar to the pachmarhi array of erenkov telescopes ( pact ; figure [ array_fig])@xcite but much larger , is chosen so that one can study the core distance dependence of various observable parameters .",
    "primaries consisting of @xmath0 rays , protons , @xmath17 and iron nuclei incident vertically on the top of the atmosphere are simulated in this study and have a fixed core position which is chosen to be the detector at the centre of the array . the resulting erenkov pool is sampled by all the 357 detectors which are used to study the core distance dependence of the parameters studied here .",
    "all the telescopes are assumed to have their optic axes aligned vertically . from practical considerations pact",
    "has been divided into 4 sectors each of 6 telescopes .",
    "the physical size of a sector is approximately @xmath18 or @xmath19 depending on the orientation . in simulation",
    "however , there are 56 such sectors or 12 pact like arrays ( comprising 4 sectors ) in the larger simulated array of 357 detectors .",
    "these are used for computing the density based parameters and study their core distance dependences .",
    "an option of variable bunch size of the erenkov photons is available in the package which serves to reduce the requirement of hardware resources .",
    "this basically defines a maximal number of erenkov photons that are treated together as single entity .",
    "however since we are interested in the fluctuations of each of the estimated observables , we have tracked single photons for each primary at all energies .",
    "multiple scattering length for electrons and positrons is decided by the parameter stepfc in the egs code which has been set to 0.1 in the present studies @xcite .",
    "the wavelength dependent absorption of erenkov photons in the atmosphere is not however taken into account .",
    "the present conclusions are not expected to be dependent on photon wavelengths@xcite .",
    "the figure of merit of a parameter that can distinguish between vhe @xmath7rays and cosmic ray hadrons depends primarily on two factors .",
    "firstly , it should accept most of the @xmath7rays and secondly it should be able to reject most of the hadrons .",
    "we define such a figure of merit which is often called as _ quality factor _ , as @xcite :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the number of @xmath2 rays accepted , @xmath22 is the total number of @xmath2 rays , @xmath23 is the number of background cosmic rays accepted and @xmath24 is the total number of background cosmic rays .",
    "the quality factor thus defined is independent of the actual number of @xmath7rays and protons recorded .",
    "this is slightly different from the q - factor generally used to measure improvement in the signal to noise ratio after applying cuts based on erenkov image shapes and orientation @xcite .",
    "local density fluctuations ( ldf ) are defined as the ratio of the rms variations to the mean number of photons in the 7 mirrors of a telescope . in the particular configuration chosen in the present study ,",
    "the 7 mirrors form a compact pattern .",
    "hence ldf , in this context , represents the short range ( @xmath25 ) photon jitter .",
    "here we try to compare ldf s for @xmath8-ray primaries _ vis - a - vis _ hadronic primaries and see if there is any tangible difference which could in - turn be used to discriminate the hadronic background .",
    "we have computed the ldf for each of 357 detectors for @xmath8-ray and proton primaries whose energies at the top of the atmosphere are chosen such that they have comparable erenkov yield on the ground .",
    "figure [ rad_ldf ] shows the radial variations of mean ldf both for @xmath8-rays and protons for three pairs of primary energies as shown . the panels @xmath26 and @xmath27 show the radial variation of ldf for mono - energetic primaries while panel @xmath28 shows the same when the energies of the primary are picked randomly from a differential power law spectrum ( within the energy band of 0.5 - 10 @xmath10 for @xmath8-rays and 1 - 20 @xmath10 for protons ) of slope -2.65 .",
    "one can readily see that ldf increases smoothly with increasing core distance for both @xmath8-ray and proton primaries beyond the hump distance of about 130 @xmath4 at this observation level @xcite .",
    "ldf for proton primaries is distinctly higher than that for @xmath8-rays at all primary energies considered here while their absolute values as well as their separations decrease with increasing primary energy as expected @xcite .",
    "figure [ qf_ldf ] shows the distributions of ldf s for @xmath0ray and proton primaries of various energies incident vertically at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the distributions for proton primaries are more skewed compared to those of @xmath0rays and hence result in good quality factors .",
    "the widths of the distributions for both types of primaries decrease with increasing energy and their relative separations too decrease .",
    "the vertical dashed lines show the threshold values chosen to yield maximum quality factors and retain atleast 30% @xmath0ray signal .",
    "only detectors within a core distance of 150  @xmath4 are used in these distributions .",
    "table [ tab_ldf ] shows the quality factors estimated using ldf as a parameter for the same primary energies of @xmath0rays and protons shown in figure [ rad_ldf ] .",
    "the second column shows the threshold ldf values such that the showers whose ldf values are above this are discarded yielding a quality factor shown in column 3 .",
    "the column 4 lists the fraction of the @xmath0ray and proton events retained in the process .",
    "the quality factors decrease steadily with increasing primary energies probably because the intrinsic fluctuations are smoothed out at higher primary energies .",
    "this is consistent with the radial variations shown in figure [ rad_ldf ] .",
    "in addition , the threshold ldf values decrease with increasing primary energies since the value of ldf s also decrease with energy .    0.25 cm    .quality factors derived using local density fluctuations for primaries of various energies incident vertically at the top of the atmosphere . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^ \" , ]",
    "the subject of intrinsic inter - shower fluctuations has been dealt at length by chitnis and bhat @xcite . here",
    "what we are addressing is the techniques of exploiting intra - shower fluctuations in erenkov photon density at the observation level .",
    "it is well known that in the case of hadronic primaries large fluctuations in the number of secondary particles created during the hadron multi - particle production is the main reason for larger fluctuations relative to that in photon primaries .    as can be seen from the tables [ tab_ldf],[tab_mdf ] and [ tab_alf ] that the quality factors fall with increasing primary energy .",
    "this is consistent with our previous study @xcite where it was observed that the intra - shower density fluctuations decrease monotonically with increasing primary energy , thus reducing the distinguishability of @xmath8-rays from protons .",
    "it may be interesting to note here that the fraction of protons rejected using these parameters increase with increasing primary energy at the cost of losing more @xmath8-ray signal .",
    "it has been seen in figures [ rad_ldf],[rad_mdf ] and [ rad_alf ] that the erenkov photon density fluctuations are strong functions of the core distance as the photons received at various core distances are produced at different altitudes , _",
    "i.e. _ at different stages in the cascade development @xcite . as a result",
    ", we see a dependence of the quality factors on the core distance .",
    "we have used a uniform cut of 150 @xmath4 on the core distance in all the present studies ( except for inclined showers since the erenkov light pool generated by them is azimuthally asymmetric ) since no showers of primary energy @xmath29 with impact parameter above 150 @xmath4 will generate a pact trigger .",
    "however it is important to know the effect of this cut on the quality factors studied here .",
    "figure [ rad_qf ] shows the variation of quality factors based on ( a ) @xmath30 , ( b ) mdf and ( c ) ldf as a function of core distance cuts ( increasing in units of 50 @xmath4 , 0 - 50 @xmath4 , 0 - 100 @xmath4 _ etc .",
    "_ , shown as points ) used for primary energies of 500 @xmath31 and 1 @xmath10 for @xmath8-rays and protons respectively .",
    "the quality factors from @xmath30 and mdf fall continuously when longer core distance events are included while that from ldf shows a maximum when the core distance cut is 150 @xmath4 .",
    "also shown in the figure are the quality factors when only showers with differential impact parameter ranges 0 - 50 @xmath4 , 50 - 100 @xmath4 _ etc .",
    ", _ are included ( histogram ) .",
    "the quality factors from mdf and @xmath30 show a minimum for showers with impact parameters around the hump region ( _ 100 - 150 @xmath4 _ for pachmarhi altitude ) .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the absolute values of mdf and @xmath30 exhibit minimum separation around the hump region as seen in figures [ rad_mdf ] and [ rad_alf ] respectively .",
    "the quality factors based on ldf show a maximum in the same core distance range .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the hump in the case of @xmath8-ray primaries .    in practice",
    "one can estimate the primary energy from which we can estimate the maximum possible core distance .",
    "this would enable us to make an optimum estimate of the nature of the primary .",
    "alternately one can estimate the core position of each shower by using the curvature of the shower front@xcite , as mentined before , which would help in deciding the optimum cut on the core distance for the data set .",
    "if the three types of photon density based parameters investigated in the present study are independent , and mdf could be related . it has been found that the improvement resulting from the tandem application of @xmath30 over and above ldf & mdf is marginal as expected .",
    "] then one can use them in tandem to improve the hadron rejection efficiency even further , a procedure similar to the multi - dimensional shower image analysis @xcite . after applying the cuts based on the three parameters , to the same data - set in tandem the resulting quality factors are 2.22 @xmath32 0.06 , 1.53 @xmath32 0.08 , 1.54 @xmath32 0.10 for the three distinct primary energies studied here _ viz . _ 100 & 250 @xmath31 , 0.5 & 1.0 @xmath10 and 1.0 & 2.0 @xmath10 respectively . thus using the erenkov photon density based parameters alone",
    "one is able to reject more than 90% of background protons .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 has been used by the celeste group to reject nearly 80% of the proton primaries from their data from the crab nebula . from their simulation studies a quality factor of 1.6 has been obtained while the @xmath8-ray energy threshold of celeste is @xmath33 . from the present studies",
    "we have estimated a quality factor of 1.33 for primary energies of 100 @xmath31 and 250 @xmath31 for @xmath8-rays and protons respectively for pachmarhi altitude ( table [ qf_alf ] .",
    "considering their lower energy threshold ( 50 @xmath31 ) , their quality factor is consistent with ours @xcite .",
    "in this work we have examined the feasibility of improving the signal to noise ratio using the differences in the fluctuations of erenkov photon distribution in the light pool generated by @xmath8-ray and proton initiated showers .",
    "the estimates of quality factors are relevant to the configuration of pact which uses the wavefront sampling technique .",
    "however the quality factors using the parameters studied here can be easily optimized to any array configuration of erenkov telescopes .",
    "various shower characteristics like the image shape , distribution of light on the ground , time profile & structure , spectrum , polarization and the uv content in the erenkov light have been suggested in the literature for hadron discrimination .",
    "it has been verified experimentally that the shape and orientation of the erenkov images can reject more than 99% of the background @xcite .",
    "similarly , from our earlier studies on erenkov photon temporal properties @xcite and the present investigations on their photometric properties we can conclude that one can efficiently reject more than 90% of the cosmic ray background while adopting wavefront sampling technique .",
