    "<S> complete suppression of the ase noise outside of the signal band is achieved with a second cwdm in alice s receiver ( and with additional attenuation in eve s receiver ) .    </S>",

    "<S> that receiver is ase limited  and essentially quantum optimal  with an error - exponent that is 3db inferior to that of an ideal opa receiver for the same transmitted power , so it might seem to provide a much easier route to passive eavesdropping immunity . such , however , is not the case : when eve taps the alice - to - bob and bob - to - alice links and uses her own homodyne receiver , it too is ase limited and its ber is the same as alice s . </S>",
    "<S> so alice s initial broadband signal - idler entanglement is absolutely essential to her obtaining immunity to eve s passive eavesdropping , because eve can then only employ the broadband thermal light she taps from alice and its modulated version that she captures from bob .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurements show alice enjoying five orders - of - magnitude error - probability advantage over eve  when both use realistic receivers  at the secure - communication operating point . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> if bob s bit sequence is equally - likely and statistically independent then : ( 1 ) alice receives very close to one bit of information for each bit that bob has transmitted ; and ( 2 ) eve receives nearly zero information about each of bob s bits at this operating point . </S>",
    "<S> however , both alice and eve s receivers are limited more by their technical noise than the ase - generated noise that sets their ultimate sensitivity : at the secure - communication operating point , alice s ase - generated variance is only 26.7% ( 25.1% ) for @xmath0rad modulation ( @xmath1rad modulation ) of her total noise variance .    </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to evaluate the qi performance gap in a different way : alice s information advantage over eve . </S>",
    "<S> the two panels in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ infoadvantage ] display alice s shannon information @xmath36 , an upper bound on eve s holevo information @xmath37 , and a lower bound on alice s information advantage @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplemental material for details . ) in the top panel , alice s shannon information is computed using the error probabilities from the solid blue curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figber_vs_pumppower ] , while the upper bound on eve s holevo information is the most she could learn about an infinitely long sequence of bob s bits from an optimum collective quantum measurement on the light she extracts from the alice - to - bob and bob - to - alice channels . here </S>",
    "<S> we see that with alice using her imperfect opa receiver she can get up to 0.8bits of information advantage , per bob s transmitted bit , over eve s optimum collective quantum measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> [ infoadvantage ]    a more convincing demonstration that quantum illumination offers alice a significant information advantage is shown in the bottom panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ infoadvantage ] . </S>",
    "<S> here we have changed the beam splitter that eve uses to tap the bob - to - alice transmission to have 10% transmissivity instead of the 90% value used in our experiment . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> , eve gets the same amount of alice s light that bob does and nine times the amount of bob s light that alice does . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the upper bound on her holevo information is unchanged from what is seen in the top panel . </S>",
    "<S> this is because her received bpsk modulation depth and the standard deviation of the ase - generated noise that dominates the fluctuations in the jointly - gaussian state she receives both increase in proportion to the fraction of the light she taps . </S>",
    "<S> alice s ber , however , is somewhat degraded by reducing the amount of light she gets from bob , because of her receiver s technical noise . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , her information advantage over eve s optimum collective quantum measurement now peaks at 0.66bits / bit .    </S>",
    "<S> our experiment demonstrates the qi - communication protocol s immunity to _ passive  eavesdropping that was predicted , theoretically , in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that reference already noted that this protocol is vulnerable to _ active  attacks , in which eve injects her own light into bob s terminal . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , eve could inject her own spdc signal light into bob , retaining her source s idler light for use with the light she taps from the bob - to - alice channel . </S>",
    "<S> steps that could be taken to ward off active attacks were suggested in @xcite , and initial analyses of many of these approaches have been performed @xcite , but more work is needed on defeating active attacks . _ _    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the benefits of bosonic entanglement can be reaped over an entanglement - breaking channel . </S>",
    "<S> our qi protocol experimentally achieved more than five orders - of - magnitude ber advantage for alice over a passive eavesdropping eve when both use realistic receivers . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , based on the excellent fit between our data and theory , we claim that alice enjoys an information advantage that can exceed 0.6bits per bob s transmitted bit over the optimum collective quantum eve when eve taps 50% of the alice s transmission and 90% of bob s transmission . </S>",
    "<S> these advantages are consequences of alice s initial broadband signal - idler entanglement , because they disappear when alice s signal - idler phase - sensitive cross correlation is classical , or when alice uses a laser source . </S>",
    "<S> the meta - lesson of our experiment is as follows : the performance disparity between a qi entangled - state input and a thermal - state input in communication over a lossy , noisy bosonic channel suggests that entanglement may be utilized to good effect in other entanglement - breaking environments .    </S>",
