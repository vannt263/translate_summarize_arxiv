    "excitons are electrically neutral and have finite lifetimes . these are two obstacles which make the development of excitonic spintronics , or spin - optronics challenging .",
    "how possibly one can explore the current , which is carried by neutral particles , and whose amplitude changes with distance and time ? - is a fair question to ask . while electrons and holes have been considered as perfectly valid spin carriers , and exotic effects like the spin hall effect  @xcite have been intensively studied for them  @xcite , the spin currents carried by excitons  @xcite and exciton - polaritons  @xcite over tens or even hundreds of micrometers remained relatively less explored .",
    "there existed a huge imbalance of theoretical works on fermionic and bosonic spin transport .",
    "this is changing now .",
    "a number of phenomena have been observed and studied in the field of bosonic spin currents recently  @xcite@xmath0wertz2012 . to summarize tens of publications in one sentence :",
    "bosonic systems bring new quantum coherent effects to the physics of spin transport .",
    "for instance , stimulation  @xcite and amplification  @xcite of spin currents are possible in exciton and exciton - polariton bose gases .",
    "bosonic spintronics or spin - optronics operates with electrically neutral spin carriers which makes control of spin currents carried by excitons a non - trivial task .",
    "fortunately , the exciton density replaces charge in many aspects : the density currents may be efficiently controlled by stationary or dynamic potential gradients as demonstrated in recent works kuznetsova2010 , leonard2012 . combined with evident advantages of bosonic amplification and low dephasing ,",
    "this makes spin - optronics a valuable alternative to fermionic spintronics .",
    "besides bosonic effects , exciton spin transport has another important specific feature : it is dissipative by its nature , as the spin carriers have a finite ( and short for excitons in regular materials ) life - time . in continuous wave optical experiments stationary spin textures can appear : excitons are injected in the structure , they propagate ballistically or diffusively , and eventually disappear by radiative recombination .",
    "their polarization properties and spin are inherited by the emitted photons , that is why the polarization patterns observed in near field photoluminescence experiments directly characterize exciton spin currents in the plane of the structure .",
    "the goal of this work is to define what the exciton spin , magnetization and polarization currents are , and to explain how they can be described within the most frequently used spin density matrix ( dm ) approach and mean - field   @xcite approximation .",
    "we consider a specific system , namely a planar zinc - blend semiconductor structure containing quantum wells , where excitons can be formed .",
    "this choice is motivated by recent experimental results in gaas / algaas based coupled quantum wells .",
    "we limit the scope of this paper to heavy - hole excitons , however , our approach can be easily extended to light - hole excitons or excitons in quantum wells of a different symmetry .",
    "we do not speak here about the large variety of recent experimental results and application of the formalism presented here to the description of one particular experiment , as this would make this paper too long and too specific . for a direct comparison of theoretical simulations with the experimental data we address the reader to ref . .",
    "the approaches formulated here are suitable for the description of a variety of excitonic spin effects in quantum wells .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the spin dm formalism accounting for the different mechanisms of spin re - orientation and the relation to electron and hole spin currents . in section",
    "iii we present numerical results obtained within the spin dm formalism and analyze them . in section [ sec : gp ] we study the non - linear spin dynamics of propagating excitons using the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations .",
    "the next three sections of the paper are devoted to exciton spin currents and polarization currents .",
    "conclusions are perspectives are given in section viii .",
    "in zinc - blend semiconductor quantum wells ( e.g. in the most popular gaas / algaas system ) , the lowest energy exciton states are formed by electrons with spin projections on the structure axis of + 1/2 and -1/2 and heavy holes whose quasi - spin ( sum of spin and orbital momentum ) projection to the structure axis is + 3/2 or -3/2 .",
    "consequently , the exciton spin defined as the sum of the electron spin and heavy - hole quasi - spin may have one of four projections on the structure axis : + 1,-1,+2,-2  @xcite .",
    "these states are usually nearly degenerate , while there may be some splitting between them due to the short and long - range exchange interactions . only the states with quasi - spin projections @xmath11",
    "are coupled to the light , these are so - called bright states .",
    "the states with quasi - spin projections @xmath12 are called dark states .",
    "it is important to note that the present formalism addresses the spin part of the exciton wavefunction , which is a product of electron and hole spin functions .",
    "for example , the probability to find the exciton in the spin state + 1 is given by a product of probabilities to find an electron in the spin state -1/2 and the heavy hole in the spin state + 3/2 .",
    "the four component exciton wave - function is : @xmath2where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the components of the electron spinor wavefunction ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the components of the heavy - hole spinor wavefunction .    to describe the dynamics of the system we will first define the hamiltonian ( section  [ sec : hamiltonian ] ) describing the different physical mechanisms of spin evolution .",
    "we then introduce the spin dm ( section  sec : densitymatrix ) for the description of exciton spin states .",
    "we relate its components to the observable stokes vectors of light emitted by bright excitons and use the liouville equation to describe its evolution in time . from the dm one can describe the polarization state of excitons and thus exciton spin currents .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the relationship with electron and hole spin currents ( section  [ sec : ehcurrents ] ) .",
    "here we derive the exciton hamiltonian in the basis of + 1,-1,+2,-2 states , accounting for the spin - orbit interaction ( dresselhaus and rashba effects )  @xcite , long- and short - range exchange interactions  @xcite and zeeman effect , but neglecting exciton - exciton interactions , which will be discussed in the section  [ sec : gp ] and neglecting magnetic field effect on center - of - mass motion and internal structure of exciton @xcite .",
    "we consider excitons propagating ballistically in the plane of a quantum well .",
    "we shall characterize them by a fixed wave - vector , @xmath7 .",
    "we represent the full exciton hamiltonian @xmath8 as a sum of three parts describing the spin - orbit and zeeman effects on electrons , @xmath9 , and holes , @xmath10 , and the exchange induced splittings of exciton states , @xmath11 : @xmath12      we recall that the rashba - dresselhaus effect is a momentum - dependent splitting of spin bands in two - dimensional semiconductor systems .",
    "it originates from a combined effect of the atomic spin orbit coupling and asymmetry of the potential in the direction perpendicular to the two - dimensional plane .",
    "this asymmetry comes either from the applied bias ( which is described by the rashba term in the hamiltonian ) or from the intrinsic asymmetry of the crystal lattice ( described by the dresselhaus term in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we shall separately consider both the dresselhaus term ( in this sub - section ) and the rashba term ( in the next sub - section ) .    in order to build the @xmath13 matrix hamiltonian for excitons , we start with simpler @xmath14 hamiltonians describing the spin - orbit and zeeman effects for electrons and holes .",

    "the linearly polarized current can be stronger further away from the source than at closer distances .",
    "this is attributed to an increasing linear polarization degree further from the source .",
    "in addition , one can recall that while spin density currents are generally weaker further from the source , there is some compensation due to the conversion between dark and bright excitons ( as shown in fig .",

    "substitution of fermions by bosons and of a scalar electric charge by a spin vector can not be formally done in these theories . basically , all mesoscopic and quantum transport effects need to be reconsidered if we speak about electrically neutral bosonic spin carriers like excitons or exciton - polaritons .",

    "terra incognita_. experimentally , direct measurements of transport of indirect excitons and exciton - polaritons in time - resolved imaging experiments have become possible in recent years . in this work , we have demonstrated that exciton polarization currents are inseparably connected with electron and hole spin currents .",
    "the intensity and direction of exciton polarization currents and electron and hole spin currents is governed by an interplay of spin - orbit effects , zeeman effects and exciton exchange effects . in the non - linear regime , the pattern of spin currents may also be affected by spin - dependent exciton - exciton interactions .    we have developed two complementary approaches to the description of exciton spin currents and textures .",
    "the dm formalism allows for description of the spin transport effects in both classical exciton gases and condensates of non - interacting excitons , while the gp equations describe propagation of exciton condensates .",
    "we predict non - trivial topologies of interacting exciton spin in condensates , and suggest tools of their control , such as external magnetic and electric fields , and source intensity .",
