    "( classical ) statistical mechanical systems in equilibrium are described by the gibbs measure , which connects the propensity of a system to move between two states taken in isolation ( the energy differences between these two states ) to the probability of finding the system in one of the states , when all states are available .",
    "this relation is normally used to find equilibrium statistics of a system ( magnetizations , correlation functions etc . ) by sampling a dynamics for which the gibbs measure in a stationary state .",
    "a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , such as glauber dynamics for ising systems , which we will review briefly below in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , can work if the sample average converges quickly enough to gibbs measure , and if the quantity to be measured has wide support in phase space .",
    "well - known scenarios where this is case are spin systems in the high - temperature phase and when measuring _",
    "e.g. _ total magnetization . in the low - temperature phase relaxation time to the gibbs distribution can be very long . on the other hand , if the quantity to be measured is _",
    "e.g. _ the magnetization of a single spin , then mcmc in a large system is slow for the trivial reason that one needs to sweep through all the spins while just being interested in the changes in and average over one of them .",
    "if the interactions are weak , marginal probability distributions can be computed perturbatively in mean - field theory  @xcite , which give closed equations for _ e.g. _ single - spin magnetizations . for dilute systems , where every spin is not connected to most other spins , very powerful _ message - passing _ methods have been developed by physicists , information theorists and computer scientists over the last two decades to compute marginals of gibbs distributions quickly and accurately  @xcite . while these _ cavity equations _ can not ( in their simplest form ) deal with the complex phases of random spin systems at low temperature , in suitable scenarios they are much more accurate than mean - field theory , and they greatly improve on mcmc for single site magnetization and other local properties by substituting a cumbersome sampling by a direct deterministic computation . the cavity method has found to have many technological as well as fundamental applications  @xcite .",
    "the situation is very different for out - of - equilibrium systems , in itself is an extremely broad term covering everything from macroscopic hydrodynamics ( turbulence )  @xcite and physical and chemical kinetics  @xcite to interdisciplinary applications of statistical physics to neuroscience , population biology , and other fields  @xcite .",
    "we here consider the model systems obtained when generalizing the mcmc rules of ising spin systems ( glauber dynamics ) from the equilibrium case ( symmetric interactions ) to a non - equilibrium case ( non - symmetric interactions ) .",
    "such `` kinetic ising '' models are only conceptual  but tractable  models of real spin systems driven out of equilibrium , and have mainly been studied with applications to neuroscience in mind  @xcite . from the mathematical point of view , they are specific examples of markov chains which do not obey detailed balance conditions .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium systems , there is hence no simple expression for a stationary state akin to a gibbs measure , but such a state , when it exists , is a ( complicated ) function of all the details of the model . on the other hand , mcmc works as well in such systems as for standard equilibrium ising models , and mean - field theory have been developed up to second order in the interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "this leaves open the case of dilute kinetic ising models , where in the equilibrium case cavity methods would be preferable .",
    "a dynamic cavity method has only very recently developed for majority dynamics@xcite and glauber dynamics  @xcite and was investigated by us for parallel and sequential update schemes in  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic cavity method as outlined in  @xcite comprises first an ansatz on probability distributions , similar to standard cavity , then the belief propagation ansatz that cavity distributions factorize , and then also a further assumption of markovianity .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the second assumption is exact for fully asymmetric models with the parallel update rule . in a more general case , where either the interaction matrix has both a symmetric and an asymmetric component , or where the update rule is different , it is however but an approximation .",
    "the numerical results of  @xcite , which showed that for some such mixed instances the dynamic cavity is quite accurate , were somewhat unexpected .",
    "the main motivation for the present paper is therefore to show more systematically in what parameter ranges dynamic cavity converges ( for these models ) , where it is accurate compared to mcmc , and to compare its predictions to mean field theory .",
    "we will show that for dilute kinetic ising models , dynamic cavity works also for the magnetizations of individual spins , and is considerably more accurate than mean - field calculations of the same quantities .",
    "kinetic ising models have been studied by other approaches , and we outline them briefly here . when the discreteness of states is relaxed to a spherical ising model .",
    "sompolinsky and zippelius developed a langevin equation formalism  @xcite , later extended by crisanti and sompolinsky to the non - equilibrium case  @xcite , where several phases of these ( dynamical ) models are outlined .",
    "although pioneering , predicting magnetizations of individual spins is out of scope of such methods , as the sphericity approximation has been made .",
    "the dynamic replica theory ( drt ) has been applied to kinetic ising models  @xcite , which , by the nature of replica theory , however only applies to averages over ensembles of models .",
    "sommers developed a path integral formulation for the glauber dynamics  @xcite , which was at that time only investigated approximately . as an alternative approach to path integral formulation , generating functional analysis",
    "was developed to study non equilibrium statistical mechanics of disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "it was shown by neri and boll in  @xcite that at least in some cases , a dynamic cavity analysis explicitly averaged over a random ensemble recovers the results of generating functional analysis .",
    "recently , hertz and roudi  @xcite used generating functional analysis to derive mean - field theories , for infinite - range spin glass models . to compare the accuracy of the predictions of single - site magnetizations by the dynamic mean - field formula of  @xcite to the dynamic cavity for dilute mixed models was one further motivation for this work .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the glauber dynamics for spin glasses , the model which we will study . in section  [ sec : infinite_range ] we discuss two approaches to a dynamic version of the tap corrections to first - order mean - field theory  @xcite , while in section  [ sec : bp ] we derive dynamic cavity equations for diluted networks in parallel update .",
    "this derivation should be seen as an alternative and ( we hope ) clearer alternative to  @xcite and our earlier contribution  @xcite .",
    "the main new results of this paper , on the convergence phase of dynamic cavity and on a comparison between the predictions of dynamic cavity and mean - field theory to mcmc are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . in section  ( [ sec :",
    "conclusion ] ) we conclude and discuss possible application areas of dynamic cavity .",
    "the asymmetric dilute ising model is defined over a set of @xmath0 binary variables @xmath1 , and an asymmetric graph @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a set of @xmath0 vertices , and @xmath4 is a set of directed edges . to each vertex @xmath5",
    "is associated a binary variable @xmath6 .",
    "the graphs @xmath7 are taken from random graph ensembles with bounded average connectivity . following the parametrization of  @xcite",
    "we introduce a connectivity matrix @xmath8 , where @xmath9 if there is a link from vertex @xmath10 to vertex @xmath11 , @xmath12 otherwise , and matrix elements @xmath8 and @xmath13 are independent unless @xmath14 . the random graph is then specified by marginal ( one - link ) distributions @xmath15 and conditional distributions @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in this model",
    "the average degree distribution is given by @xmath19 , and the asymmetry is controlled by @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the two extreme values of @xmath21 give respectively a fully asymmetric network ( @xmath22 ) , where the probabilities of having two directed links between pairs of variables are uncorrelated , and the symmetric network ( @xmath23 ) where the two links @xmath24 and @xmath25 are present or absent together .",
    "the parameter set is completed by a ( real - valued ) interaction matrix @xmath26 .",
    "additional assumptions on the @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ smallness or that they are random with suitable distribution are stated when used . however , for concreteness the reader may in much of this paper think of @xmath26 to be independent identically distributed random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath27 ( gaussian or binary ) such that for the fully connected networks @xmath28 , the interactions scale as the sherrington - kirkpatrick model  @xcite .",
    "the interactions among spins determine the dynamics of system . in the parallel update scheme , which will be considered here , at each ( discrete ) time",
    ", all spins are updated according to the glauber rule @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective field acting on spin @xmath10 at time step @xmath31 @xmath32 and the parameter @xmath33 , analogous to inverse temperature , is a measure of the overall strength of the interactions .",
    "the notation @xmath34 in ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) and ( [ eq : eff_field ] ) indicates all vertices having a direct links to node @xmath10 and @xmath35 is the ( possibly time - dependent ) external field acting on spin @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we will adhere to the convention that the interaction indices are written in the same order as the temporal order of the interacting spins .",
    "hence we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    the joint probability distribution over all the spin histories @xmath38 has in principle the following simple markov form @xmath39\\,p(\\vec{\\sigma}(0 ) ) \\label{eq",
    ": prob_dyn}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the appropriate transition matrix describing dynamics and updates . if we would have a fully understanding of joint probability distribution defined in ( [ eq : prob_dyn ] ) we could compute time dependent macroscopic quantities such as magnetization and correlations .",
    "the evolution of a a single spin is ( trivially ) defined by summing over the histories of all spins except one @xmath41 which can be further marginalized to the probability of one spin at one time @xmath42 and similarly for pairwise joint probability of the histories of two spins @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , the time evolution of single site magnetization can be obtained from eq([eq : marginal ] ) as @xmath45 and similarly the correlation functions @xmath46 substituting eq([eq : mag ] ) into dynamics defined in ( [ eq : prob_dyn ] ) we have @xmath47 where brackets are average with respect to trajectory history .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : exact - magnetization ] ) is exact for the time - dependent magnetization .",
    "it is not directly practical , since the marginal over one spin at one time ( the magnetization ) depends on the joint distribution of all the spins influencing it at the previous time , but as we will see in section  [ sec : information - geometry ] it can be used as a starting point of a perturbative calculation .",
    "the mean field theory of spin glass systems started with the sherrington kirkpatrick ( sk ) model  @xcite . in this model",
    "all spins interact with all other spins ( infinite - range couplings ) , which motivates the simplest mean field or `` naive mean - field '' approximation @xmath48 . shortly afterwards a more accurate mean field theory ( tap )",
    "was introduced by introducing onsager reaction for the sk model .",
    "this corrects @xmath49 inside the @xmath50 to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the field from spin @xmath10 on spin @xmath11 and where @xmath53 can be interpreted as a local susceptibility at spin @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "since in equilibrium ising @xmath54 the tap equilibrium mean field theory is hence @xmath55 . as stated in  @xcite these results can be derived from the cavity approach .",
    "these can also be derived by observing that in equilibrium a susceptibility is related to a correlation by fluctuation - dissipation , and the appropriate correlation was computed by a perturbative argument  @xcite . for a later approach by field - theoretical methods , expanding a functional determinant describing the fluctuations around a mean - field stationary point of an action , see _",
    "@xcite , and references therein .    in equilibrium",
    "ising systems the naive mean - field and the tap approximations can further be computed by expanding the boltzmann distribution in the interaction strength  @xcite . to first and second order in interactions this result",
    "agree with naive mean - field and tap .",
    "recently , a dynamic version of tap has been derived by hertz and roudi  @xcite by a field - theoretical argument , and we show here in section  [ sec : information - geometry ] below that this also follows from information geometry , essentially a systematic expansion in interaction strength . for completeness , we will also show that the same dynamic version of tap follows from the `` exact mean - field theory '' of mzard and sakellariou  @xcite , as already pointed out in  @xcite .    outside equilbrium fluctuation - dissipation",
    "does not hold .",
    "conceptually one could therefore say that `` dynamic tap '' as such is undefined , or , alternatively , that a proper generalization of tap to a non - equilibrium system should be based on fluctuation relations generalizing fluctuation - dissipation theorems  @xcite ( a task we have not attempted to carry out ) . in this paper",
    "we take however a more pragmatic approach , and understand `` dynamic tap '' to be the formulae derived in  @xcite .    before turning to the technical discussion ,",
    "let us note that since mean - field and tap have obvious computational advantages , these theories have been applied in much wider settings than in which they have been derived , particularly in neuroscience . for a recent review , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this section we recall the theory in  @xcite , with a view to compute the expansion in small interactions to third order .",
    "we start by rewriting the exact equation ( [ eq : exact - magnetization ] ) in the following explicit form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the collection of spins neighboring @xmath10 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the corresponding joint probability distribution . in a fully asymmetric network , when an interaction coefficient @xmath60 in above is non - zero , then the opposite @xmath26 is zero .",
    "each of the spins @xmath61 on the right hand side therefore does not depend directly on spin @xmath10 on yet one time step before , _",
    "i.e. _ on @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of each of the @xmath61 will in turn depend on distributions of other @xmath63 , but the distribution of these @xmath63 do not depend on the @xmath61",
    ". if there are no short paths in the interaction graph between any pairs of spins @xmath64 on the right hand side of ( [ eq : exact - explicit - magnetizations ] ) except through the cavity spin @xmath65 , or if such paths are unimportant , then the spins @xmath61 will be independent in an asymmetric network . and the effective field @xmath66 acting on @xmath67 will be the sum of independent random variables .",
    "when the number of interacting spins is large the distribution of @xmath30 follows from the central limit theorem @xmath68}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we note that to arrive at this result , first the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath71 ) is taken at given connectivity @xmath19 ( so that the terms @xmath72 are independent ) , and then @xmath19 is taken large ( so that there are many of them ) . in general @xmath73",
    "is defined as @xmath74\\ ] ] when the additional assumption that the interaction coefficients @xmath60 are random , independent and evenly distributed and small the sum is dominated by the diagonal terms _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath75 this gives the `` exact mean - field '' theory of  @xcite : @xmath76 \\label{eq : asym_mf}\\ ] ] with the gaussian measure @xmath77.equation  ( [ eq : asym_mf ] ) can be iterated starting from some initial condition to get all magnetizations at any time , and is exact when the assumptions hold _ i.e _ when the network is fully asymmetric , when the cavity assumptions hold , when any spin is influenced by a large number of other spins , and when the interactions are random , independent , evenly distributed and small .",
    "to expand  ( [ eq : asym_mf ] ) in small interactions we introduce @xmath78 and take all these quantities of order @xmath21 .",
    "we have @xmath79 & = &   \\tanh\\left[\\beta \\langle h_i(t)\\rangle\\right ] + xc_i(t)\\beta(1-\\tanh^2\\left[\\beta \\langle h_i(t)\\rangle \\right ] ) \\\\ \\nonumber - & & \\quad x^2c_i^2\\beta^2\\tanh\\left[\\beta \\langle h_i(t)\\rangle\\right](1-\\tanh^2\\left[\\beta \\langle h_i(t)\\rangle\\right])+ { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^3)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where every odd term in this expansion will give zero when integrated against a gaussian measure",
    ". therefore we have @xmath80 - \\beta^2\\tanh\\left[\\beta \\langle h_i(t)\\rangle\\right](1-\\tanh^2\\left[\\beta \\langle h_i(t)\\rangle\\right])c_i^2(t ) +   { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^4 ) \\label{eq : tanh - fourth}\\ ] ] we would like to write the right hand side of ( [ eq : tanh - fourth ] ) as @xmath81 + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^4)$ ] .",
    "a comparison shows that this is possible setting @xmath82c_i^2(t)$ ] .",
    "we therefore have to _ fourth _ order the following functional expression @xmath83c_i^2(t)\\right)\\right ] +   { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^4 ) \\label{eq : tanh - functional}\\ ] ] to first order in @xmath21 the solution is @xmath84 +   { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^2 ) \\label{eq : naive - mean - field}\\ ] ] which is the `` dynamic naive mean - field '' . inserting this back in ( [ eq : tanh - functional ] ) we have `` dynamic tap '' of  @xcite @xmath85 +   { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^4 ) \\label{eq : tap_dynamic}\\ ] ]",
    "the last term inside the @xmath50 is of order @xmath86 and a form analogous to the onsager back - reaction term ; there is no third order correction in @xmath21 in this theory .",
    "we will now derive the analogues of ( [ eq : naive - mean - field ] ) , ( [ eq : tap_dynamic ] ) and a third order term by following the approach of information geometry  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath87 be the time history of a collection of spins .",
    "we assume that these spins have been generated by a kinetic ising model with parallel updates and ( possibly ) time - dependent external fields .",
    "the joint probability of the history of all the spins is then @xmath88 in information geometry the space of these model is considered as a manifold with coordinates being the ( many ) parameters @xmath89 .",
    "a sub - manifold is the family of independent models @xmath90 a mean - field approximation is defined as the the independent model with the same magnetizations as the full model  @xcite . for our case",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath91 is the variational equation with respect to parameter @xmath92 of the kullback - leibler divergence @xmath93=\\sum p\\ln\\frac{p}{p^{\\rm{ind}}}$ ] .",
    "therefore , the mean field approximation in information geometry can also be seen as the independent model with the least kullback - leibler divergence from the full model  @xcite .",
    "following the approach of  @xcite we take the interaction parameters ( @xmath26 ) as small parameters ( of order @xmath21 ) , and assume that the differences @xmath94 can be expanded in @xmath21 : @xmath95 we can then write in analogy with eq.3.2 of  @xcite @xmath96 here @xmath97 stands for the set of all interacting couplings and external fields and @xmath98 runs over relevant indices .",
    "the subscript indicates that all derivatives are evaluated at the independent model , and the left - hand side is zero because this is the variational equation . in the last term",
    "the sum goes over all the parameters labeled @xmath99 and the parameter increments are the first order terms @xmath100 and @xmath101 ; on third and higher orders mixed terms of @xmath100 and @xmath102 will appear .",
    "a calculation presented in appendix gives the results @xmath103 equation  ( [ eq : delta - expansion ] ) together with the variational equation can be re - written @xmath104 it is seen that to @xmath21 this is `` dynamic naive mean - field '' , compare ( [ eq : naive - mean - field ] ) , to @xmath86 this is `` dynamic tap '' , compare ( [ eq : tap_dynamic ] ) , and to to @xmath105 typically there is a non - zero term absent in ( [ eq : tap_dynamic ] ) .",
    "such a higher - order difference between the exact mean - field theory for the asymmetric model and the field - theoretical approach of  @xcite was also pointed out in  @xcite ( page  4 , in text below eq .",
    "the cavity method for equilibrium systems was introduced in  @xcite while the dynamic version was studied but recently  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the equilibrium case , using only the cavity assumption does not in general provide us with an efficient algorithm in the dynamic case , but further assumptions are necessary . in this section",
    "we derive the dynamic cavity method for the kinetic ising problem , taking a more explicit route than in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we consider a number of spins evolving according to a dynamics such as ( [ eq : prob_dyn ] ) , and we let @xmath106 denote the whole history of spin @xmath10 , @xmath107 .",
    "the probability in ( [ eq : prob_dyn ] ) can then be alternatively be interpreted as a joint probability of spin histories , @xmath108 , and this probability can be represented by a graph where nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected if either @xmath26 or @xmath60 ( or both ) are non - zero . the corresponding product form is @xmath109 which is already normalized .",
    "belief propagation is expected to work well if this graph is locally tree - like _ i.e. _ if all loops are long , and can be ignored  @xcite . in ( [ eq : product - form ] )",
    "this is never the case , even if the couplings are fully asymmetric , for the simple reason that if spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 drive spin @xmath110 , then they are coupled both by the terms @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and by the normalization @xmath113 .",
    "however , these couplings are of a rather peculiar type . to proceed we introduce four different marginal probabilities .",
    "the first @xmath114 is the marginal probability of spin history @xmath106 .",
    "the second @xmath115 is the marginal probability on the set of histories @xmath116 .",
    "the third @xmath117 is the marginal on the set of histories @xmath118 .",
    "the fourth and last is @xmath119 , a cavity distribution on @xmath118 .",
    "this we take as the marginal on @xmath118 in a revised model where both the spin history @xmath106 as well as the normalization @xmath120 have been eliminated .",
    "all four probabilities depend on external field parameters which are not necessarily the same .",
    "in particular , we will express @xmath117 with one set of external fields as @xmath119 with another set of external fields . by definition @xmath121 .",
    "the peculiarity of the model is that the ( normalized ) conditional probability @xmath122 is already explicitly included in ( [ eq : product - form ] ) .",
    "we can therefore compare @xmath123 to @xmath124 this comparison shows that @xmath117 with external fields @xmath125 is the same as @xmath119 with _ modified _ external fields @xmath126 . since @xmath127 we can therefore write the marginal probability @xmath128 as    @xmath129    where @xmath130 indicates all the parameters ( external fields and interactions ) which are the same on the two sides of the equation , and @xmath131 is the set of external fields that are modified .    the next step is to make the belief propagation assumption that the spin histories are taken independent in the cavity graph : @xmath132 we here used used @xmath133 to represent marginal probabilities of neighboring spins , as standard in the bp literature .",
    "we now consider the subgraph @xmath134 connected to one spin @xmath11 in the cavity of @xmath10 . in analogy to above",
    "we want to compare the marginal on the set of neighbours to spin @xmath11 in @xmath134 , to the cavity distribution on the same set of variables . as above",
    "the first with one set of external fields is the same as the second with another set of external fields , and we therefore find the following recursion equations ( `` bp update equations '' ) : @xmath135 where @xmath136 indicates all the parameters ( external fields and interactions ) which are the same on the two sides of the equation , and @xmath137 is the set of external fields that are modified .",
    "since in fact @xmath138 ( spin @xmath110 is not directly connected to @xmath10 ) we note that in ( [ eq : external - fields ] ) the upper index @xmath139 can be dropped on both sides .",
    "the effective field on spin @xmath11 in @xmath134 is @xmath140 and @xmath141 is the transition probability for the single spin @xmath11 in the model on @xmath134 .",
    "the marginal probability over the history of one spin ( `` bp output equation '' ) follows from ( [ eq : mar_cav ] ) and ( [ eq : fact ] ) and is @xmath142 equations ( [ eq : bp_mess_syn ] ) and ( [ eq : bp_output ] ) are the dynamic cavity equations for our system .",
    "both are large sets of equations connecting marginal distributions and cavity distributions between two probabilistic models with different parameters . in general",
    "these equations are ( as far as we know ) only of conceptual value since on top of connecting different models , the right hand side also involves on the order of @xmath143 operations . in bp",
    "such an operation would have to be iterated ( for all variables ) a number of times to reach convergence : as @xmath144 grows large this becomes unfeasible for the same reason that ordinary bp does not work well if the state space of each variable is large .",
    "we can define ( and will later use ) marginalizations of the messages down to one time ( it is no restriction to take this time as the last time ) : @xmath145 but in general these quantities do not obey closed equations among themselves .",
    "an important exception are fully asymmetric networks , since there at most one of @xmath26 and @xmath60 is non - zero .",
    "we note that in ( [ eq : bp_mess_syn ] ) and ( [ eq : bp_output ] ) the probability distribution of spin @xmath10 depends on the neighbors @xmath146 through the effective fields @xmath147 and @xmath148 , but the messages sent from the neighbors to @xmath10 also depend parametrically on the history of @xmath10 through the modified external fields @xmath149 .",
    "this back - action is absent for the fully asymmetric case where @xmath150 independent of spin @xmath10 .",
    "as discussed the marginalization of dynamic bp over one time is not in general a markov process .",
    "however , the long time behavior of dynamics ( stationary state ) is often demanded in many cases . in this section",
    "we explain an approximation scheme for computing marginal probabilities for one spin over one time in stationary state , a procedure called _ one - time approximation _ in  @xcite and _ time factorization _ in  @xcite .",
    "we start with the dynamic bp for the time histories of messages , _",
    "eq([eq : bp_mess_syn ] ) , where on the right hand side the time trajectory of messages sent from neighboring spins carry the information from the whole time history of those spins .",
    "we note that the full dynamics eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob_dyn ] ) is in fact markov .",
    "this , and the need to introduce some approximation , motivates _ the time - factorization ansatz _ which we write for the terms in the right - hand side of  eq([eq : bp_mess_syn ] ) : @xmath151 where @xmath152 indicates the parameters of the model , the same on both sides .",
    "obviously , when inserted into the right - hand side of  ( [ eq : bp_mess_syn ] ) such a factorization is not preserved on the left hand side .",

    "it is also useful to note that though the derivatives act on the complete expression involving both probability density @xmath190 and the @xmath50 they partially obey a chain rule when taken to act on the magnetizations alone :    * a derivative with respect to an external field @xmath191 functions as an ordinary derivative and obeys a chain rule ; * a derivative with respect to an interaction coefficient @xmath101 acting on a once or more than once primed quantity , such as @xmath192 and @xmath193 , functions as an ordinary derivative and obeys the chain rule ; * a derivative with respect to an interaction coefficient @xmath101 acting on an unprimed quantity such as @xmath194 must be treated apart , since this derivative will include a term taken on the @xmath50 , which in turn will give a higher order correlation .",

    "the term from acting on @xmath202 in the first line gives a second derivative with respect to interaction coefficients of a magnetization .",
    "the terms from the second and the third line give combinations involving either second derivatives of a magnetization , or first derivatives of a correlation function .",
    "the terms from the last line are a third order correlation function and further first deritives of second order correlation functions .    taking all together we can sum the contributions to @xmath203 where in the last line",
    "we have used @xmath204 .",
    "all the terms in above containing the first order terms @xmath205 vanish , the partial derivative terms of the second order correlation function with respect to external field vanish , and the last line is at least smaller than @xmath105 .",
