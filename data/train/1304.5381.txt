    "superconductivity is an essential ingredient in quantum nano - electronics .",
    "its macroscopic phase coherence allows to produce easily large objects obeying quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "aluminum is presently the emblematic material in this field .",
    "its popularity is mainly due to the ease of its lithographic patterning and the high quality of its native oxide .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath0 k of bulk aluminum is however rather low , calling for the use of dilution refrigerators and elaborate electronic filtering as temperatures @xmath1 are usually needed .",
    "moreover , the relevant energy scale of superconductivity , namely the superconducting gap @xmath2 , is usually proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "a low critical temperature @xmath3 is therefore synonymous of a low critical current in short josephson junctions or superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite .",
    "higher @xmath3 elemental superconducting metals such as vanadium and lead are occasionally used @xcite , but they suffer from rapid aging under ambient air conditions . niobium is the highest-@xmath3 simple element ( 9.2 k ) and is also rather immune to aging .",
    "its main drawback is the strong sensitivity of its thin film superconducting properties to contamination .",
    "as niobium is a refractory metal , its evaporative deposition implies extremely high target temperatures . in the case of lift - off processes , this leads to significant heating and outgassing of the organic resist mask , provoking a strong reduction and scatter of the effective critical temperature @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "nb nanostructures with a high @xmath3 can be fabricated within a lift - off process using a deposition set - up in which the nb target is far away from the sample @xcite ; this method is however difficult to transpose to most setups .",
    "several techniques have been used to circumvent this severe limitation to niobium applications .",
    "sputtering can provide niobium films of high quality without the use of a high temperature target .",
    "such films can be subsequently patterned by dry reactive ion etching .",
    "this however sets constraints on possible materials combinations in hybrid structures @xcite and is incompatible with connecting niobium to fragile material such as graphene , carbon nanotubes or thin sheets of topological insulators .",
    "sputtering through a mask ( resist or mechanical ) is also possible @xcite but , due to the lack of directionality of the deposition , leads to poorly defined edges .",
    "this can cause a gradual loss of the superconducting properties over a broad transition region .",
    "suspended masks made of si , ge or sin , supported by thermostable resists like poly - ethersulfones have further been developed @xcite .",
    "such processes provided nb sub - micron structures with a critical temperature up to 8 k , including hybrid josephson junctions with a high nb - cu interface transparency @xcite .",
    "the use of these particular resists is nevertheless cumbersome ; for instance , the ambient hygrometry has to be controlled during resist spinning .",
    "non - organic evaporation stencil masks based on a suspended bilayer of si@xmath4n@xmath5 and sio@xmath6 have been developed in the past @xcite ; lift - off and integration of arbitrary non - superconductors ( graphene etc . )",
    "are yet again impossible .",
    "finally , the possibility of using metallic bilayer masks has been demonstrated in the past @xcite .",
    "this method was in particular used to pattern large niobium devices with dimensions in the upper 100 @xmath7 m range @xcite .",
    "we report here a new and simple method for lithographic patterning of extremely narrow and well - defined nb nanostructures with a high critical temperature .",
    "our approach relies on replacing the traditional organic resist mask by a fully metallic one .",
    "we take advantage of the high wet etch rates of aluminum , with respect to most other metals , by high ph chemicals used as organic resist developers .",
    "we demonstrate the fabrication and good operation of squids based on hybrid josephson junctions .",
    "( b ) voltage versus current characteristics of the same samples measured at 4.2 k. these display hysteresis ( as high as 32% for the 400 nm line ) as well as random fluctuations of the measured resistance at @xmath8 . ]",
    "we start by depositing an al / mo ( 200 nm/40 nm ) bilayer on a si / sio@xmath6 substrate . electron - beam lithography is performed on an organic resist ( pmma ) spun on top of the metal bilayer ,",
    "[ charac]a . in the developed regions ,",
    "the mo layer is removed by a reactive ion etch with a 20 w sf@xmath9 plasma for 2 minutes .",
    "the resist is afterwards removed by 10 minutes of 50 w o@xmath6 plasma etch . in the next step ,",
    "a wet etch in a basic solution ( ph @xmath10 13 ) of mf-26a @xcite etches al isotropically through the openings in the mo layer , creating undercuts of about 200 nm after a 90 s time .",
    "this leaves a locally suspended mo mask on top of the over - etched aluminum supporting layer , see fig .",
    "[ charac]b , c .",
    "this sequence of steps ensures vanishing organic contamination of deposited materials .",
    "a niobium thin film is then e - gun evaporated in an ultra - high vacuum chamber .",
    "the metallic al / mo mask is finally removed by a wet etch in mf-319 @xcite for about 45 minutes .",
    "including regularly spaced extra holes in the initial lithographic pattern allows the etchant to start lifting the metal mask from a larger number of starting points .",
    "the related minimization of this wet - etch time is important because beyond 2 hours we observe mf-319 starting to etch the si / sio@xmath6 substrate as well as the metallic layers ( nb , au , ... ) present in the device .    as a first test",
    ", we have prepared nb narrow lines using the technique described above . in these samples ,",
    "a 10 nm ti layer was deposited in situ prior to nb , as to improve adhesion and mimic the frequently used approach to contact a superconductor to novel low - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "the presence of ti however contributes to reducing the @xmath3 of the wires .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) inspection of the nb - wires obtained ( fig .",
    "[ charac]c ) shows that the edges are extremely sharp and well - defined .",
    "the 3@xmath11 ( standard deviations ) line edge roughness of the wires is 10 nm , on the order of the grain size of in both the nb film and the mo mask .",
    "line edge smearing is inferior to the lateral resolution of a standard afm tip .",
    "the roughness of the nb surface is 1.1 nm .",
    "we have performed transport measurements on these samples in a variable temperature ( 2 - 300 k ) cryostat , using a 4-probe configuration .",
    "figure [ wires]a shows the temperature dependence of the low temperature resistance r of three devices , based on lines of length 30 @xmath7 m , thickness 30 nm and widths 400 , 700 and 1000 nm respectively .",
    "the devices display stepwise decrease of resistance below t= 7.3 k. since the entire on - chip structure is made of niobium , we attribute these steps to transitions to the superconducting state of wire elements of decreasing width in series . the small resistance steps in the low resistance region can also be related to pinning and depinning of residual vortices .",
    "the rapid drop to @xmath12 corresponds to the critical temperature @xmath3 of the narrowest part of each circuit .",
    "while the critical temperature @xmath3 of the 400 nm wide line is considerably reduced , it is hardly affected for widths above 700 nm .",
    "the @xmath13 characteristics at 4.2 k show a marked resistive transition and some hysteresis .",
    "the latter is due to joule heating in the nb wire once in the normal state , which elevates the local electronic temperature compared to the bath temperature . as a result",
    "the critical current is reduced , which creates an hysteresis in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "thermal hysteresis is enhanced in narrower structures .",
    "we have further fabricated nb - au - nb proximity squids ( figure [ charac]d ) using a two - step process .",
    "we first patterned two long parallel lines of gold , 1 @xmath7 m wide and 30 nm thick , by conventional e - beam lithographic techniques .",
    "the metallic mask method described above is then used to pattern nb proximity junctions on top of these .",
    "we deposited a 50 nm thick nb layer without sticking layer . over the proximity junction ,",
    "the metal mask is free - hanging , as to form junctions as short as 200 nm . the device parameters of the three tested devices , labelled a , b and c , are summarized in table [ table ] .    in a hybrid josephson junction made of a normal metal bridging two superconducting electrodes , as a au wire between two nb",
    "electrodes here , the length scale for inducing superconductivity in the normal metal is set by the normal metal thermal length @xmath14 .",
    "here , @xmath15 is the electronic diffusion coefficient in the normal metal .",
    "@xmath16 is estimated to be about 180 nm at 135 mk while the junction lengths @xmath17 are in the range 200  400 nm .",
    "transport properties of the nb - au - nb proximity squids were measured using a four - probe current bias scheme inside a dilution refrigerator . each electrical lead to the samples was thoroughly filtered by individual 2 m long lossy coaxial lines thermalized at the cryostat base temperature . fig .",
    "[ squids]a shows the @xmath18 characteristics of squid c at zero magnetic field and 135 mk .",
    "a critical current @xmath19 is observed in the two shorter nb - au - nb squids b and c , while none is observed in a.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as proximity josephson junctions have a vanishing capacitance , they are over - damped .",
    "the @xmath18 characteristic is thus expected to follow @xmath20 for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the characteristics fit rather well this prediction , see fig .",
    "[ squids]a .",
    "a finite hysteresis is nevertheless observed for the highest @xmath19 squid ( device c ) at the lowest temperatures . while sweeping the current down from large values @xmath21 , the squid c turns non - resistive at a retrapping current @xmath22 .",
    "this hysteresis is known to be of thermal origin @xcite : the joule heat dissipated in the normal metal elevates the electronic temperature with respect to the phonon temperature as the electron - phonon coupling is the bottleneck for the electron thermalization to the bath .",
    "retrapping happens when the bias current becomes of the order of the critical current at the current electronic temperature .",
    "characteristic of device c ( circles ) at t = 135 mk and b = 0 t. the line is a fit using the over - damped junction theoretical i - v relation , see text .",

    "our samples are in the long junction limit defined as a normal metal length larger than the superconductor coherence length : @xmath24 nm . in this case , the relevant energy scale for the superconducting proximity effect is the thouless energy @xmath25 , which is much smaller than the energy gap @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of critical current with temperature in a normal metal weak link at arbitrary temperatures can be understood by solving the usadel equations . at low temperatures and in the long junction limit ( @xmath26 ) , the numerical solution to the usadel equation can be approximated by @xcite @xmath27 .",

    "the minor discrepancy can be understood as an effective junction length @xmath31 = 236 nm slightly longer than the geometrical value @xcite .",
    "the reduced value of @xmath28 reflects a lower than ideal @xmath19 , which is attributed to an imperfect transmission at the nb - au interface .",
    "argon plasma of the au structures prior to nb deposition should lead to improved contact transparencies .    finally , we have measured squid b and c critical current variation with the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the loop .",
    "figure [ squids]c shows data as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath32 , where @xmath33 = 37.6 @xmath34 for squid b and 19.2 @xmath34 for squid c is the geometric loop area .",
    "the critical current follows the expected @xmath35 periodicity , where @xmath35 is the magnetic flux quantum . at a bath temperature t = 135 mk",
    ", the modulation depth of @xmath19 reaches 80 % in sample b. the retrapping current follows the same behavior .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath19 upon flux modulation reflect the sum and the difference respectively of the critical currents of each of the two josephson junctions in parallel .",
    "the obtained flux sensitivity is about 2 @xmath36 .",
    "this performance is within the expected range for hybrid squids that are characterized by a rather low normal state impedance .",
    "we have devised a new method for the nano - fabrication of superconducting nb structures using an all - metal mask .",
    "the method is easy to implement and uses only standard clean room chemicals and methods .",
    "it allows producing superconducting nano - devices with a high critical temperature and dimensions down to the 100 nm - scale .",
    "its application to the realization of sensitive squids with little hysteresis is demonstrated .",
    "applications of this technique will allow probing josephson physics in exciting novel material systems such as single crystal nanowires @xcite , ferromagnetic nanowires @xcite , semiconducting nanowires @xcite and graphene @xcite .",
