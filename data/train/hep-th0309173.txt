    "gauge theory can be formulated in two ways which we term the differential and the integral picture . as an illustration , recall , for example , maxwell s equations which can be formulated either in terms of integral equations relating electric and magnetic fluxes through surfaces and currents through solenoids ( integral picture ) or alternatively in terms of the familiar differential equations ( differential picture ) .",
    "similarly , any gauge theory can be formulated in two ways .",
    "let @xmath3 be some space - time manifold and the gauge group @xmath4 be a lie group with lie algebra @xmath5 .",
    "in the differential formulation of gauge theory , one considers a connection of some principal @xmath4-bundle @xmath6 . in local coordinates ,  using a local trivialization of the bundle , the connection is given by a @xmath5-valued connection @xmath0-form @xmath7 which transforms under changes of the coordinates as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes a transition function on the overlap of the coordinate patches @xmath10 .",
    "the connection is usually taken to be the basic field of the theory ,  the variation in the action principle is with respect to @xmath7 , and in a path integral quantum theory , one has to integrate over all possible connections .",
    "the lagrangian and the action of the theory depend on the curvature , @xmath11,\\ ] ] which is a @xmath5-valued @xmath1-form .",
    "it transforms under coordinate changes in a gauge covariant way , @xmath12    as an alternative to this differential picture , there exists the integral formulation . in this formulation ,",
    "one uses the group valued parallel transports , @xmath13 along curves @xmath14\\to m , \\tau\\mapsto\\gamma(\\tau)$ ] as the basic variables .",
    "locally , the parallel transport always exists , and it is uniquely determined as the solution of the first order matrix differential equation , @xmath15u_\\gamma(t),\\ ] ] where we have written , @xmath16 for the parallel transport along @xmath17 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . the initial condition is @xmath20 .",
    "the curvature can then be calculated from the holonomy @xmath21 of a closed loop @xmath17 in the limit in which the loop shrinks to infinitesimal size .",
    "this integral picture of gauge theory closely resembles what is done in lattice gauge theory , but without the restriction that the curves have to live on some fixed lattice .",
    "note that in the integral formulation , the parallel transports satisfy various relations .",
    "now let us illustrate the basic idea of higher gauge theory .",
    "suppose first that the gauge group in conventional gauge theory is abelian , say @xmath22 .",
    "then the connection @xmath0-form @xmath7 is imaginary and the transition functions are of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a suitable imaginary valued function , and   becomes , @xmath25 so that the curvature @xmath1-form   is just the exterior derivative , @xmath26    abelian gauge theory with   and   now admits the following higher level generalization . let @xmath7 be some ( imaginary valued ) @xmath27-form which becomes the basic field of the theory .",
    "the lagrangian and the action depend only on the curvature @xmath28-form @xmath29 .",
    "the theory therefore enjoys a local gauge symmetry with the transformation law   for some @xmath30-form @xmath31 .",
    "this is a consequence of the poincar lemma because locally any closed @xmath27-form @xmath32 is of the form @xmath33 .",
    "the abelian theory at level @xmath27 is therefore completely governed by the de  rham cohomology of @xmath3 .",
    "the abelian theory at level @xmath34 is known in the physics literature as kalb ",
    "ramond fields  @xcite , and at generic level @xmath27 as @xmath27-form electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "both refer to the differential picture of the theory .",
    "the corresponding integral picture makes use of @xmath27-dimensional surfaces labeled with elements of the abelian group @xmath35 . if the @xmath27-surfaces were restricted to a fixed hyper - cubic lattice , we would have at level @xmath36 the @xmath37-model of statistical mechanics , at @xmath38 , @xmath35-lattice gauge theory , and at higher @xmath27 the models of  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these higher level theories as _ higher gauge theory_. does there exist a _",
    "non - abelian _ higher gauge theory , at least at level @xmath34 ?",
    "many authors  @xcite have attempted to construct such models , but the necessity to find an underlying geometrical picture by suitably generalizing fibre bundles seems to impose serious constraints . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only thoroughly studied model was the freedman ",
    "townsend model  @xcite which , however , has only an abelian local symmetry and lacks a geometrical understanding of why it has to be abelian .",
    "what precisely are the geometrical conditions involved in higher gauge theory ?",
    "the coboundary condition @xmath39 of the abelian case is , of course , no longer useful as the curvature @xmath40 is in general no longer just @xmath41 , but rather given by  .",
    "assume we have some non - abelian ` connection ' @xmath1-form and wish to define its ` curvature ' @xmath42-form .",
    "geometrically , the @xmath1-form would be associated with surfaces labeled by elements of some non - abelian group @xmath43 , and the curvature @xmath42-form should be some group element associated with a closed surface , composed from several constituent surfaces that are all labeled with elements of @xmath43 . since the group @xmath43 is non - abelian and",
    "there is no canonical surface order available , we simply do not know how to compose the various non - abelian labels .",
    "recall that the points of a curve have a natural order , and the definition of the parallel transport along a given curve indeed makes use of this order . for higher dimensional submanifolds , however , such a canonical order is not available .",
    "this lack of natural order has led teitelboim  @xcite to the formulation of a no - go theorem ruling out the existence of non - abelian gauge theories for extended objects .",
    "this applies essentially to any gauge theory whose connection is a non - abelian @xmath27-form , @xmath44 .    with the introduction of @xmath1-categories in mathematics , it recently became possible to sidestep this no - go theorem at @xmath34 . on the mathematical side , there is the construction of non - abelian gerbes generalizing fibre bundles , see , for example  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that gerbes provide the desired generalization of fibre bundles .",
    "they are , for example , conjectured to play a role in theories on coincident @xmath45-branes is string theory , see , for example  @xcite . in the present paper , we prefer a slightly different approach based on the definition of lie @xmath1-groups by baez  @xcite which generalize ordinary lie groups to higher level and which include the symmetries of gerbes at least in the case of strict categories .",
    "this will allow us to explicitly solve the surface ordering problem , thereby providing a rigorous basis for chepelev s conjectures  @xcite , and to see in detail how teitelboim s no - go theorem is avoided .",
    "our results finally provide the geometrical background to most of the traditional approaches to non - abelian @xmath1-forms , at least as long as strict categories are sufficient , and explain geometrically why these models are so restricted .",
    "it comes as a surprise that @xmath2-theory which is usually not mentioned in the context of non - abelian @xmath1-forms , does form a non - trivial example of higher gauge theory .",
    "let us now briefly outline our approach .",
    "starting from the notion of lie @xmath1-groups , baez has defined lie @xmath1-algebras and started to generalize the differential picture of gauge theory to a theory involving non - abelian connection @xmath0- and @xmath1-forms  @xcite .",
    "open questions in this approach are the precise form of the local gauge transformations and of the gauge invariant expressions which are required in order to define lagrangians and actions in physics .",
    "also starting from the notion of lie @xmath1-groups , we have generalized the integral picture of gauge theory to a theory involving curves and surfaces labeled with elements of non - abelian groups  @xcite .",
    "this formulation has the advantage that the theory of @xmath1-categories dictates the form of the local gauge transformations and the expressions for the gauge invariant quantities .",
    "the no - go theorems can be avoided because the underlying @xmath1-categorical structure leads to a non - trivial interplay of the curve and surface labels .",
    "an important question is how the differential  @xcite and the integral approach  @xcite are related . in this article , we start from the integral picture of  @xcite and systematically derive the corresponding differential expressions by studying the non - abelian curve and surface labels of the theory in the infinitesimal limit , assuming that the labels depend smoothly on the curves and surfaces . in the smooth case , we find an additional flatness condition at level @xmath0 which has not yet appeared in the literature .",
    "it implies in particular that the non - abelian part of the connection @xmath1-form agrees with the curvature of the connection @xmath0-form , that the curvature @xmath1-form vanishes and that the curvature @xmath42-form is abelian .",
    "we show that an interesting example of higher gauge theory is given by @xmath2-theory with non - abelian gauge group  @xcite in which the level-@xmath0 flatness is a key feature of the theory , in fact encoded in the field equations .",
    "the theory of @xmath1-categories then provides the explanation for the extended local ( topological ) symmetry .",
    "otherwise , the resulting conditions show that the classic no - go theorems reappear only in the differential picture in which they rule out the naive generalization of the yang ",
    "mills action .",
    "the algebraic structure of the integral picture , however , still allows us to have non - trivial central group elements that characterize the @xmath1-curvature associated with closed labeled surfaces which we call @xmath1-holonomies .",
    "if the centre of the gauge group is discrete such as , for example , for @xmath46 , the differential picture would require these central elements to be trivial , but in the integral picture and in any non - perturbative quantum theory based on it , no such restriction applies .",
    "the integral picture is therefore more general than the differential one and is in some sense essentially non - perturbative .",
    "since the non - trivial central elements can be interpreted as the presence of singularities of codimension @xmath1 , in some sense the integral picture of higher gauge theory rather _ predicts _ the existence of topological defects in the differential formulation .",
    "the present article is structured as follows . in section  [ sect_integral ]",
    ", we recall the construction of higher gauge theory in the integral formulation as it was developed in  @xcite .",
    "our presentation is self - contained .",
    "we emphasize the calculational aspects and try to hide as much as possible of the @xmath1-category theory in our notation . in section  [ sect_differential ] , we then derive the differential formulation of higher gauge theory starting from the integral picture and compare the result with  @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sect_conclusion ] with comments on interesting questions for further investigations .",
    "in this section , we review the integral picture of higher gauge theory following  @xcite .",
    "we call the higher level model a _ @xmath1-gauge theory _ whereas we refer to conventional gauge theory as a _ @xmath0-gauge theory _ in view of the hierarchy of models sketched in  @xcite",
    ". the theory is formulated at the integral level ,  it describes curves and surfaces which are labeled with data from some algebraic structure , supplementing the parallel transports of conventional @xmath0-gauge theory by additional group elements which are used to label surfaces .      the algebraic structure required to describe a @xmath0-gauge theory is just some gauge group @xmath4 , usually taken to be a lie group .",
    "the geometric objects that are labeled with algebraic data , are the curves giving rise to the parallel transports of the theory .",
    "the group structure ensures that we can consistently compose ( multiply ) parallel transports and also reverse their direction ( inversion ) .",
    "the algebraic structure for a @xmath1-gauge theory is a so - called @xmath1-group  @xcite .",
    "this is a pair @xmath4 , @xmath43 of groups with two maps - group  @xcite . ] .",
    "the first map is a group homomorphism @xmath47 , @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "the second map is an action of @xmath4 on @xmath43 by automorphisms .",
    "this is an operation @xmath50 taking values in @xmath43 , which is a group action , @xmath51 for all @xmath52 and @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 is a homomorphism for each @xmath55 , @xmath56 for all @xmath49 .",
    "these maps are required to satisfy the following two compatibility conditions , @xmath57 for all @xmath55 , @xmath58 .",
    "a lie @xmath1-group is a @xmath1-group in which @xmath4 and @xmath43 are lie groups and both maps @xmath59 and @xmath60 are smooth .",
    "plenty of examples of lie @xmath1-groups are known  @xcite . here",
    "we mention the following cases .    1 .",
    "the _ euclidean _ and _ poincar @xmath1-groups_. here @xmath61 is euclidean or minkowski space and @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "the map @xmath59 is trivial ,  @xmath64 for all @xmath53 , and @xmath60 is the obvious action by rotation .",
    "2 .   more generally",
    ", one can choose @xmath43 to be any vector space on which the lie group @xmath4 is represented .",
    "the map @xmath59 is trivial in this case , and @xmath60 is the action of @xmath4 on its representation @xmath43 . in this way",
    ", one defines , for example , the _ adjoint _ and the _ co - adjoint @xmath1-groups _ in which @xmath65 or @xmath66 where @xmath5 denotes the lie algebra of @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   the _ automorphism @xmath1-groups_. let @xmath43 be any lie group and @xmath4 its group of automorphisms .",
    "the action @xmath50 is the application of the particular automorphism , and @xmath47 associates with each element @xmath67 the corresponding _ inner automorphism _ @xmath68 .",
    "this example is related to non - abelian gerbes  @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the centre of @xmath72 . in general , @xmath73 is always contained in the centre of @xmath43 .      in a @xmath1-gauge theory",
    ", we have to label geometric objects at two levels .",
    "curves are labeled by elements of @xmath4 .",
    "their composition and orientation reversal is defined as in conventional gauge theory .",
    "in addition , surfaces are labeled with elements of @xmath43 .",
    "for each surface , we choose two reference points on the boundary ( full dots in the diagram below , we are going to suppress them later on ) and split the boundary into two curves with labels @xmath74 ( _ source _ ) and @xmath75 ( _ target _ ) as follows , @xmath76^{g_1}=\"g1\"\\ar@/_2ex/[rr]_{g_2}=\"g2\"&&\\bullet    \\ar@{=>}^h \" g1\"+<0ex,-2ex>;\"g2\"+<0ex,2ex > } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the label @xmath67 of the surface is required to satisfy , @xmath77",

    "the categorical structure of @xmath1-groups leads directly to the integral picture  @xcite and as a consequence to the differential formulation as derived in the present article . alternatively it would be possible to use the language of gerbes and to start with a differential formulation of higher gauge theory .",
    "one can then ask under which conditions it is possible to integrate the connection @xmath0-form along curves and the connection @xmath1-form along surfaces in a consistent way .",
    "the result of the present article suggests the conjecture that   is the required integrability condition .      first note that all the lie @xmath1-groups and lie @xmath1-algebras used in the present article are _",
    "strict_. they form only the simplest examples of these structures which can be constructed in a general @xmath1-categorical framework , but there exist the more general notions of _ weak _ and _ coherent _ @xmath1-groups and their lie @xmath1-algebras . for @xmath1-groups ,",
    "see , for example  @xcite and for lie @xmath1-algebras  @xcite .",
    "one can hope that the differential picture becomes less restrictive once we generalize from strict lie @xmath1-groups and @xmath1-algebras to weak ones .",
    "since the origin of the level-@xmath0 flatness is the very basic condition  , a fully successful weakening should therefore allow for a non - abelian kernel of the map @xmath47 .",
    "we also observe that the non - trivial @xmath1-holonomies are ruled out in the differential picture only if one requires the connection @xmath0- and @xmath1-forms to be both continuous and well defined everywhere in space - time .",
    "in particular , in the integral picture with the automorphism @xmath1-group of @xmath72 , we can have @xmath71-valued @xmath1-holonomies associated with surfaces of topology @xmath140 .",
    "if we assume that a smooth deformation of the surface changes the @xmath1-holonomy only smoothly , then the non - trivial @xmath71-element indicates that the @xmath140 is not smoothly contractible .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication that there are singularities of codimension @xmath1 in the theory which are actually _ predicted _ by the algebraic structure .",
    "soliton - like solutions of some classical field equations come to mind .",
    "in fact , the integral picture for the inner automorphism group of @xmath371 is related to the symmetries of centre vortices in qcd as sketched in  @xcite .",
    "the difference of the differential and the integral picture is much deeper , though . as an illustration",
    ", we refer to a result in the context of the path integral quantization of conventional gauge theory . for simplicity , assume that we work in the euclidean setting (  with ` imaginary ' time ) on some riemannian manifold @xmath3 .",
    "the obvious naive choice is to consider the set @xmath372 of all smooth connections @xmath7 on @xmath3 which form an affine space , and then to divide out the action of the gauge transformations .",
    "this step , however , destroys the linear structure so that the standard techniques fail to construct a useful path integral measure on the quotient @xmath373 .",
    "this failure to implement the gauge symmetry correctly can be seen as a main reason why perturbative qcd does not predict confinement as observed in nature .",
    "the sophisticated approach , see , for example  @xcite , is to consider the collection of all graphs embedded in @xmath3 , to study gauge theory in the integral picture on these graphs ,  all ` connections ' that are given by group labels attached to the edges of the graph , and finally to make use of a refinement relation on the class of all graphs which facilitates the construction of a projective continuum limit for the set of connections .",
    "not only does this set of generalized connections form a compact hausdorff space , it is also possible to fully divide out the gauge symmetry .",
    "this set of generalized connections modulo gauge transformations is a huge space that includes not only smooth or continuous connections , but rather mainly distributional ones . in order to appreciate the physical significance of this space of generalized connections",
    "it is useful to recall the most basic example of a field theory which admits a rigorous euclidean path integral quantization , the free relativistic scalar field .",
    "its path integral measure  @xcite is supported mainly on non - continuous scalar fields .",
    "in fact , the subsets of continuous and smooth fields form sets of measure zero !",
    "this is a strong indication that a restriction to smooth fields does not yield an adequate description of the corresponding quantum theory and that we should take the integral formulation seriously . in a proper continuum limit , constructed from a suitable refinement of the integral formulation of higher gauge theory ,",
    "the above - mentioned codimension-@xmath1 singularities will not only be allowed , they may actually be abundant in the path integral .",
