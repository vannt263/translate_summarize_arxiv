    "in a recent paper @xcite , it has been shown that the evolution kernel @xcite , which determines the 1-loop renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution of the @xmath0-meson light - cone distribution amplitude ( lcda ) in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , can be diagonalized by an appropriate integral transform .",

    ", the behaviour at small values of @xmath1 could be adjusted to results from non - perturbative qcd methods .",

    "the contributions to the moments from large values , @xmath186 , on the other hand , are completely determined by perturbative matching and rg evolution and therefore independent of the hadronic input model , in line with the discussion around ( [ pertbehave ] ) . in the lower half of the table",
    ", we illustrate the effects of the perturbative constraints by comparing the moments originating from the hadronic input function with its modifications from fopt alone and its ( locally ) rg - improved version , at the hadronic input scale @xmath172  gev .",
    "again , we observe that the logarithmic moments before and after the perturbative improvement are highly correlated and do not differ very much .",
    "the dual function @xmath20 of the heavy b - meson , which plays a similar role to the familiar set of gegenbauer coefficients for light - meson lcdas , has been the subject of this paper .",
    "to recapitulate and summarize we have highlighted that the transformation between the lcdas in momentum space , @xmath2 , and dual momentum space , @xmath20 , consists of eigenfunctions of the rg evolution kernel for @xmath2 .",
    "the dual function renormalizes multiplicatively , unlike the lcda @xmath35 , which in particular implies that the non - perturbative low-@xmath1 region does not mix with the perturbative domain , @xmath187 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the dual function in the perturbative domain is calculable from the ope results of a finite - moment analysis of @xmath35 @xcite , and determined its values in the region @xmath188 . by resumming perturbative logarithms",
    "we have shown that @xmath128 vanishes faster than @xmath83 for @xmath189 , such that its first inverse moment , @xmath190 , converges for @xmath191 at any perturbative scale @xmath56 .",
    "this result distinguishes the analysis of @xmath192 and related quantities in dual momentum space from the corresponding one using the standard lcda @xmath35 , which appears to suffer from artificial thresholds in its rg evolution when the rg function @xmath193 assumes positive integer values .",
    "the low-@xmath1 regime is not accessible via perturbation theory .",
    "it must be determined by other means , but can be modelled in the meantime .",
    "we have developed a method of combining a model ansatz in the non - perturbative regime with the perturbative results that respects the moment constraints and smoothly connects both domains .",
    "this was achieved by correcting the first few terms in the large-@xmath1 behaviour of the model , which is shown in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "the keen - eyed reader might inquire whether taking ever more terms into account in this manner will ultimately determine the dual function and thus render the modelled part superfluous .",
    "we found only poor or no convergence with such an approach , depending on the choice of basis functions @xmath94 , which points towards an unrelatedness between @xmath192 and other hqet parameters like @xmath72 within perturbative methods .",
    "we have illustrated our results using three different models , and also performed a numerical analysis for the phenomenologically relevant logarithmic moments @xmath145 .",
    "following the gist of our discussion thus far , we split @xmath194 between the regions @xmath195 and @xmath196 . while the contributions @xmath122 are model - independent ( and small ) , the hadronic model dominates the moments . in principle",
    "the @xmath120 can be determined from precision analyses of radiative leptonic @xmath0-meson decays , but this only determines the first few terms in an expansion of the dual function in terms of laguerre polynomials in the variable @xmath197 for @xmath113 .    the perturbative analysis of the @xmath0-meson lcda is restricted to 1-loop accuracy so far . from the theoretical perspective",
    ", it would be interesting to see to what extent the picture that emerged from our analyses continues to be valid when implementing 2-loop corrections to the evolution kernel and the perturbative moment constraints , together with higher power corrections in hqet .",

    "notice that the so constructed expansions of @xmath127 and @xmath226 , and thus the expansion of @xmath59 , respect the composition rule ( which would not have been the case if one had expanded the function @xmath214 directly ) .",
