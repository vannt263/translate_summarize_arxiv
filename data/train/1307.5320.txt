    "<S> in the framework of the top triangle moose @xmath0 model , we analyze the rare decays @xmath1 by using the form factors calculated in full @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath7 numbers : 13.30.ce , 12.60.cn    </S>",
    "<S> * 1 . </S>",
    "<S> introduction *    the rare decays @xmath1 which are induced by the flavor - changing neutral current ( @xmath8 ) can be described by the processes @xmath9 at the quark level . in the standard model @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath8 transitions are forbidden at tree level , while can occur at loop level . </S>",
    "<S> new physics models beyond the @xmath4 can appear either through new contributions to the wilson coefficients that enter into the effective hamiltonian that describes these decays , or through new operators in the effective hamiltonian which are absent in the @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> they can not only provide very important consistency check of the @xmath4 , but also are very sensitive to some new physics models beyond the @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , unlike the mesonic decays , the baryonic decays could maintain the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath11 transition exactly explains why one gives more interest to them@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 predictions for branching ratios of the semileptonic decays @xmath12 have been studied in ref.@xcite , which uses the related form factors calculated via light cone @xmath2 sum rules in full theory . </S>",
    "<S> their results show @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . the first experimental result in investigation of the rare baryonic decays has recently been reported by the @xmath16 collaboration at fermilab , and they announced the result of the branching ratio @xmath17 \\times10^{-6}$]@xcite . the @xmath18 collaboration at @xmath19 has also started to search these decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> so studying of these rare baryonic decays is now entering a new interesting era .    </S>",
    "<S> as has already been noted , rare decays induced by @xmath11 transition are quite promising for searching new physics beyond the @xmath4 . in recently years </S>",
    "<S> , many works about decays @xmath20 have been done in many new physics models , such as standard model with fourth generation ( @xmath21)@xcite , supersymmetry ( @xmath22 ) model@xcite , the universal extra dimension@xmath23 model@xcite , two higgs doublet model @xmath24@xcite , family non - universal @xmath25 model @xcite and the covariant constituent quark model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have shown that some new physics models beyond the @xmath4 can indeed give significant contributions to the rare decays @xmath20 and the present or future experimental results can be used to test or restrict these new physics models .    </S>",
    "<S> the large mass of the top quark might has a different origin from masses of other light quarks and leptons , a top quark condensate , @xmath26 , could be responsible for at least part of electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath27@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the top triangle moose @xmath0 model@xcite is one of interesting new physics models with separate sectors for dynamically generating the masses of the top quark and the weak gauge bosons @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 results largely from the higgsless mechanism while the top quark mass is mainly generated by the topcolor mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> so , in this model , there are two sets of goldstone bosons . </S>",
    "<S> one set is eaten by the gauge bosons @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath25 to generate their masses , while the other set remans in the spectrum , which is called the top - pions ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and the top - higgs @xmath34 . the properties of these new scalars have been recently studied in refs.@xcite . in this paper , we will consider the contributions of the @xmath35 model to the rare decays @xmath1 and compare our numerical results with those obtained in the @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the layout of the present paper is as follows . in section 2 , </S>",
    "<S> we simply review the essential features of the @xmath35 model . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the @xmath35 model to the observables , such as branching ratios , forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath3 ) and polarizations , which are related the decays @xmath20 , are given in section 3 . in this section </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our numerical results with predictions of the @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is given in section 4 .    </S>",

    "<S> the essential features of the @xmath35 model *    the detailed description of the @xmath36 model can be found in refs.[17,18 ] , and here we just want to briefly review its essential features , which are related to our calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak gauge structure of the @xmath35 model is @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear sigma field @xmath38 breaks the group @xmath39 down to @xmath40 and field @xmath41 breaks @xmath42 down to @xmath43 . to separate top quark mass generation from @xmath30 , a top - higgs field @xmath44 is introduced to the @xmath35 model , which couples preferentially to the top quark . </S>",
    "<S> to ensure that most of the @xmath30 comes from the higgsless side , the @xmath45 of the fields @xmath38 and @xmath41 are chosen to be @xmath46 , in which @xmath47 is the electroweak scale and @xmath48 is a new small parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath49 of the top - higgs field is @xmath50 .    from above discussions </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that , for the @xmath35 model , there are six scalar degrees of freedom on the higgsless sector and four on the top - higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> six of these goldstone bosons are eaten to give masses to the gauge bosons @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> others remain as physical states in the spectrum , which are called the top - pions ( @xmath51 and @xmath32 ) and the top - higgs @xmath34 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will focus our attention on the contributions of these new particles to the rare decays @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> in general the couplings of the top - pions and top - higgs to fermions are model dependent , which depend on the individual left - handed and right - handed rotations in the separate up- and down - quark sectors . according the assumptions given by ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the couplings of the top - pions @xmath32 and @xmath51 to ordinary fermions , which are related our calculation , are given by @xmath53\\pi^{0}_{t}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{i\\sqrt{2}}{\\nu}\\left[m_{t}v_{tb}\\cot\\omega\\bar{t}_{r}b_{l}+m_{b}v_{tb}\\tan\\omega\\bar{t}_{l}b_{r}+m_{t}v_{ts}\\cot\\omega\\bar{t}_{r}s_{l}\\right]\\pi^{+}_{t}+h.c .. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 is the @xmath55 matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings of the top - higgs @xmath34 to fermions are similar to those of the neutral top - pion @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> reference[17 ] has extensively studied the couplings of the new heavy gauge bosons @xmath31 and @xmath25 to other particles and has shown that the couplings of these new gauge bosons to two heavy quarks ( light partners ) are proportional to @xmath56 with @xmath57 being a small parameter . however , their couplings to ordinary quarks ( light quarks ) are very small . at the ideal fermion delocalization case </S>",

    "<S> thus the contributions of the @xmath35 model to the rare decays @xmath12 are mainly come from the new scalars ( @xmath51 , @xmath32 and @xmath34 ) . in the succedent section </S>",
