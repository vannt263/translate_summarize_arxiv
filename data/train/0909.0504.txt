    "the binary @xmath0 velorum contains the closest example of a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star to the sun .",
    "it is a double - lined spectroscopic binary and an extremely useful tool in understanding the evolution of wolf - rayet stars as the masses , luminosities and mass - loss rate can all be determined .",
    "recent observations by @xcite have refined the parameters of the binary orbit and the stellar components .",
    "a key parameter that was estimated was the lower limit age of both stars to be @xmath1  myrs .",
    "@xcite have took this lower limit of 3.5 myrs as the age and suggested that the system was one of the last to form in the vela ob association , based on the observation that the other stars are estimated to be older than 5 myrs .",
    "the age of @xmath0 velorum was derived by fitting non - rotating single - star isochrones to the secondary .",
    "this method assumes that the stars have never interacted and the stars are not rotating . for an average rotation rate the age would increase by about 25 percent to 4.4 myrs @xcite . then assuming no binary interaction initially seems reasonable as the system has an orbital eccentricity of 0.3 and naively this means that the system never came into contact .",
    "further consideration however finds that the orbital separation is small enough , @xmath3 , that it is almost impossible for the stars not to interact through either roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) or the more extreme common - envelope evolution ( cee ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that the two stars did interact in a timescale short enough that tidal circularization either did not occur or was not strong enough to achieve a completely circular orbit .",
    "we note that @xcite do state that such interaction is possible and implies that their derived age should only be considered a lower limit .",
    "this was not considered by @xcite when they used their age in their study .",
    "we note that the observed parameters of @xmath0 velorum depend upon the assumed distance for the system . in this work",
    "we have used the distance derived by @xcite from fitting the binary system of @xmath4  parsecs .",
    "this is greater than the hipparcos distance of @xmath5  parsecs and similar to the distance estimate from a single measurement by the vlti that gave a distance to @xmath0 velorum of @xmath6  parsecs @xcite .",
    "we have accounted for the uncertainty in the distance to the binary by including an error of @xmath7  dex in the luminosities of the binary components .",
    "there is a large amount of literature showing how binary interactions can change the evolution of both stars in a binary @xcite .",
    "however , while there are many different sources of single - star evolution models and they mostly agree with each other ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are no widely available binary equivalents .",
    "construction of a set of binary models is not a simple process because rather than only needing to vary initial mass to obtain different evolution , the initial binary separation and initial mass of the secondary must also be varied .",
    "this increases the computer time required to cover the full range of possibly evolutionary paths .",
    "here we use the set of detailed binary evolution models created by @xcite to determine a new age for @xmath0 velorum .",
    "first , considering the possible ages of the @xmath8 wr star .",
    "second , searching through our binary models for systems that agree with the masses and orbital separations of the system today .",
    "third , the age of the secondary star is considered .",
    "afterwards , our results and the implications of the new age we derive are discussed .",
    "the stellar models we used were calculated with the cambridge stars code and were described in @xcite . here , we restrict ourselves to use models with a metallicity mass fraction of @xmath9 , which we take to be solar . these models are all based on circular orbits .",
    "however as discussed by @xcite circular and eccentric orbits with the same semi - latus rectum should produce equivalent evolution .",
    "it is difficult to accurately determine the age of a wr star .",
    "the star has lost at least half of its initial mass which could have been 20 to @xmath10 .",
    "however it is possible to estimate an age range for a wr star from its current mass and wr subtype .",
    "the star is designated as wr11 in the catalogue of @xcite and is identified as a wc star .",
    "this means it is a highly stripped star that has lost all its hydrogen and most of its helium with the atmosphere dominated by carbon .",
    "we therefore search through our stellar models and record the age of wc stars with masses between 8.4 and 9.6@xmath11 , the inferred mass of the wr star in @xmath0 velorum . here",
    "we consider the wr star alone and not the companion or binary orbit .",
    "we assume a model is a wc star when there is no hydrogen present and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mass fraction abundance of carbon , oxygen and helium respectively @xcite .",
    "we find that our models indicate a range of possible ages from 3.3 to 6.4  myrs for wc stars with masses similar to that of the wr star in @xmath0 velorum .",
    "our lower estimate of 3.4 myrs agrees with the age derived by @xcite for the o star , although this was with older single star isochrones .",
    "the youngest wc stars are from stars with initial masses above @xmath16 and the older wc stars are from stars with an initial mass of @xmath17 .",
    "lower initial masses are preferred by the initial mass function thus initially less massive , and therefore older , stars are the preferred when we estimate the age of wr11 .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have searched through our binary models to find those with a reasonable match for the @xmath0 velorum system . for a certain binary model to match ,",
    "we require that the following are all true at some point during the lifetime of the binary .    *",
    "the wr star is of wc type . * the mass of the wr star is between 8.4 and 9.6@xmath11 . *",
    "the luminosity of the wr star is between @xmath18 and 5.3 . *",
    "the secondary mass is between 27 and 30@xmath11 . *",
    "the orbital separation is between @xmath19 and 2.3 . *",
    "any interaction occurs after the main sequence ( case b mass - transfer ) .",
    "as already discussed the binary is eccentric and all our models have circular orbits .",
    "we therefore assume that , for our binary systems to fit , it must have a radius somewhere in the range of separations of the observed binary .",
    "the effect of eccentricity would be for mass - transfer to begin earlier @xcite and thus the initial separation would be greater for more eccentric systems to obtain the same evolution as we discuss here .",
    "we choose to only consider systems with mass - transfer after the main sequence ( case b ) .",
    "this is because when mass - transfer events occur on the main sequence ( case a ) they happen on a nuclear timescale and the tidal forces would have more time to circularise the orbit .",
    "post main - sequence mass - transfer occurs on a thermal timescale and therefore tidal forces have less time to circularise the orbit and the resulting binary remains eccentric .    we do not attempt to model the secondary here beyond matching its mass . the secondary does lose mass by stellar winds and mass is transferred from the primary to the secondary .",
    "the accretion rate onto the secondary is limited to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the secondaries thermal timescale .",
    "if the mass - transfer rate is greater than this value the excess mass is lost from the system .",
    "we do not include angular momentum transfer and thermohaline mixing in this model .",
    "this is because they produce complex affects on the secondary , especially angular momentum transfer which will alter the amount of rotationally induced mixing .",
    "this makes the evolutionary outcome of the secondary uncertain @xcite .",
    "we consider the secondary in more detail in section 2.3 .",
    "we list our models that match @xmath22 velorum in table [ initialp ] .",
    "the range of initial primary masses and initial separations are narrow .",
    "the initial separations are similar to the observed separation .",
    "this indicates that the widening of the system due to stellar - wind mass - loss is countered by the mass - transfer event tightening the binary .    for each of the systems a binary interaction must have occurred .",
    "therefore we might simply assume that @xmath0 velorum should be a circular orbit rather than eccentric .",
    "it is worth asking , how unusual it is for a wolf - rayet binary to be eccentric .",
    "figure 3 in @xcite shows that in general binaries with periods of 30 days or less tend to be circular .",
    "however there are a number of systems with periods between 30 and 100 days that have eccentricities in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 .",
    "this is because binaries with periods below 30 days experience case a mass - transfer and therefore their tidal forces have a long time to circularise the orbit .",
    "the binaries with longer periods experience case b mass - transfer , that proceeds at shorter thermal timescales giving less time for tidal forces to circularise the orbit .",
    "these facts suggests that @xmath0 velorum is not unusual .    from the above , the assumption that binary mass - transfer events must always circularise the orbit is not true . we have estimated a circularization timescale for the models in table [ initialp ] and compared this to the time for the cee .",
    "the key to determine the timescale of circularization in a binary is the damping mechanism for the tides created in the star .",
    "in general stars with a convective envelope have shorter timescale than those with radiative envelopes by around two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we find that in our @xmath23 model the star is mostly radiative with a radius of @xmath24 at the time of interaction .",
    "the model does have a small convective shell just outside the helium core between 1 to @xmath25 but it is too deep within the star to effectively damp tides .    using the details given in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we have estimated the circularization timescale of the binary to be a few thousand years , similar to the time of the interaction in our model .",
    "the two timescales are similar in order of magnitude , but because both are uncertain we conclude it is unlikely that complete orbit circularization is possible . in comparison we find that for initially tighter binaries mass - transfer occurs on the main - sequence via rlof only over a timescale of @xmath26 myrs",
    ". therefore there would be plenty of time for complete circularization to occur .    one final detail to consider in table [ initialp ] are the ratios of surface carbon , oxygen and helium abundances by number from our models .",
    "@xcite derived the abundance ratios for @xmath0 velorum from different model atmosphere codes .",
    "they found that [ c / he ] took values of 0.15 to 0.06 and [ o / he ] took values of 0.03 to 0.01 respectively .",
    "the binaries in table [ initialp ] agree with these inferred compositions .",
    "however looking at the models in detail when we match the [ c / he ] ratio we underestimate [ o / he ] by a factor of 3 indicating the rotation may play some role in the evolution of the primary star during the wr phase .      modelling",
    "the secondary is not an easy task . if the two stars have interacted in some way it is difficult to know exactly what effect this would have had on the secondary @xcite .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to study the effect of rotation on the secondary alone .",
    "we see from table [ initialp ] that there is a wide range of initial masses possible for the secondary .",
    "some possible progenitors accrete a large amount of mass to reach that observed today .",
    "these stars with lower initial mass , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are less evolved at the time of mass - transfer and thus have lower luminosity and/or higher surface temperature at the time when the primary star matches the observations .    here",
    "we concentrate on the secondary star from our favoured model with an initial mass of @xmath29 which accretes very little mass .",
    "we find that this star has the same mass as observed for the secondary at the same time as the primary is a wc star with a mass of @xmath8 and fulfills our criterion outlined in section 2.2 .",
    "however as shown in figure [ figa ] a basic model only just agrees with the observed luminosity and radius and @xmath0 velorum would need to be closer than 300  parsecs .",
    "this disagrees with the distances measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if we consider that the star can only be more distant than we have assumed as indicated by @xcite and thus more luminous it suggests that our basic model can not reproduce the observed secondary radius . in figure [ figb ]",
    "we see that the basic model agrees with the luminosity and mass simultaneously but only at the very end of its main - sequence lifetime .",
    "using figure [ figc ] we estimate an age from the basic secondary model of @xmath30  myrs .",
    "rotation is a complicated physical process in stars and our code does not currently include it .",
    "the general effect of rotation is to induce mixing in a star that increases the time spent on the main - sequence by mixing nuclear processed material to the surface of the star and new hydrogen into the core . to simulate this effect",
    "we have included an arbitrary small amount of extra - mixing through the radiative zone of our model .",
    "we see in figure [ figa ] that with this mixing the star achieves a higher luminosity at a given radius and eventually agrees with the observed luminosity and radius of the secondary . comparing to models that do include rotation @xcite",
    "the evolution is similar to that provided by reasonable rotation velocities around @xmath31 .",
    "we see in figure [ figb ] that the model with enhanced mixing also agrees with the observed mass and luminosity of the secondary and is in the middle of its main - sequence evolution .",
    "figure [ figc ] allows us to estimate the age of the secondary star to @xmath32  myrs .",
    "this is consistent with the range of ages we determined for the age of the wc star and binary system above .",
    "but the relationship between stellar mass and luminosity of our stellar models.,width=317 ]     but the relationship between stellar mass and luminosity of our stellar models.,width=317 ]     but the relationship between age and luminosity of our stellar models .. ,width=317 ]",
    "we have used three different methods to estimate the ages of @xmath0-velorum . these were estimating the age of a @xmath8 wc star , modelling the binary orbit and components simultaneously and considering the age of the best fitting initial secondary mass with and without enhanced mixing .",
    "we find that the age must be older than 3.5 myrs and by combining different ages we estimate that it is @xmath2 myrs .",
    "the 2 myrs difference is because @xcite used single - star non - rotating isochrones to determine a lower limit for the secondary star age .",
    "this work demonstrates the necessity for publicly available grids of binary star models to be created .",
    "the use of single - star models can give misleading results that lead to incorrect conclusions .",
    "our age estimate is in better agreement with ages derived for the surrounding lower - mass stars from @xcite .",
    "it suggests that all the stars in the vela ob2 association formed at a similar time .    the older age estimate may also help explain the non - detection of 1.8 mev photon emission from @xmath0 velorum",
    "this emission is due to the radioactive decay of @xmath33al formed during core hydrogen burning by proton capture on @xmath34 mg .",
    "@xmath33al has a half - life of 0.75  myrs and @xmath0 velorum is predicted by @xcite to have detectable emission .",
    "currently no such emission has been detected .",
    "we suggest there are two factors reducing the amount of @xmath35 below the detectable abundance .",
    "first in our models of @xmath0 velorum we find the time difference between the end of core hydrogen burning and our age estimate is 0.85  myrs thus less than half of @xmath35 created remains .",
    "second the lower initial mass of the wr star may mean less @xmath33al is created during the main - sequence as predicted for the @xmath16 star by @xcite .",
    "the fact that the binary is still eccentric does not rule out a binary mass - transfer event .",
    "our binary models indicate that some post main - sequence ( case b ) mass - transfer events occur so rapidly that the tides formed in the mostly radiative envelope are unable to circularise the orbit .",
    "on the other hand , wr binaries with periods below 30 days experiences case a mass - transfer on the main - sequence and the tides do have time to circularise the orbit .",
    "this places a limit on the circularization timescale of tides in radiative envelopes to a few thousand years , the time required for the hydrogen envelope to be removed in a mass - transfer event .",
    "our major remaining uncertainty is the evolution of the secondary .",
    "we find that it is possible to explain its current evolutionary state if initially it was a @xmath29 star with a rotation rate of @xmath36 .",
    "less massive stars that accrete a large amount of mass never match the radius and luminosity of the secondary when the primary star is a wc star of @xmath8 .",
    "future study of this system may provide more clues to the effect of rotational mixing and of mass - transfer on the secondary stars in binary systems .",
