    "the dynamical behaviour of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) such as collective modes is one of the important source of information about the physical characteristics of the condensate .",
    "more ever , the spectrum of elementary excitations of the condensate is utilized to derive the thermodynamic properties .",
    "the properties of elementary excitations may be investigated by considering small deviations of the state of the bec from equilibrium and finding periodic solutions of the time - dependent gross - pitaeviskii equation .",
    "the resulting excitation spectrum is called the bogoliubov spectrum which for a uniform bose gas is @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the uniform density of the cloud , @xmath2 is the two body interaction strength and @xmath3 is the free particle energy with @xmath4 as the mass of the atom and @xmath5 is the wave number of the excitations . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath6 is a linear function of @xmath5 i.e @xmath7 , which is phonon like . on the other hand at short wavelength @xmath8 . in any case @xmath9 as @xmath10 , a typical sound - like behaviour .",
    "in addition , we note that the bogliubov mode comprises of two modes , namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the first mode is simply the free particle mode while the second mode is like the much discussed amplitude mode @xcite .",
    "the amplitude mode has a property that it gives rise to a gap at @xmath13 .",
    "the amplitude mode is basically the oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter of the bec and the phase mode is the spatial and temporal oscillations of the phase of the order parameter .",
    "recently , the amplitude or the gapped mode has been discussed in the context of the bose - hubbard model @xcite . it was shown that close to the superfluid - insulator transition @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the hopping parameter and @xmath16 is the mean filling per site ) , the combined action of the lattice and the interaction leads to a lorentz - invariant critical theory which admits the existence of an amplitude mode . on the other hand , in the gross - pitavaeskii theory the density mode",
    "is bound to the phase degree of freedom , resulting in the unique and well known bogoliubov mode .",
    "the amplitude mode was detected recently using the technique of bragg spectroscopy @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we show that a simple transformation can separate the amplitude and phase degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular we analyze the uniform bose gas and a bose gas confined in an optical lattice .",
    "let us consider a uniform gas of interacting bosons contained in a box of volume @xmath17 . within the bogoliubov approach ( equivalent to including terms which are no more than quadratic in @xmath18 ( annihilation operator for a bose particle with momentum @xmath5 ) and @xmath19 ( creation operator for a bose particle with momentum @xmath5 ) ) the hamiltonian is written as @xcite    @xmath20,\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the expectation value of @xmath22 . in eqn.(1",
    ") , we have also taken into account that the total number of particles is fixed . the chemical potential is @xmath23 .",
    "note that in eqn.(1 ) , the summation is to be taken over only one half of momentum space , since the terms corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath24 must be counted only once .",
    "we now write down the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath18 and @xmath25 from eqn.(1 ) .",
    "this yields    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we now make a transformation @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this yields from eqns.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , the usual bogoliubov mode    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . on the other hand a transformation of the type @xmath35 and @xmath31 yields",
    "two modes    @xmath36    @xmath37    the @xmath38 branch is the free particle mode while @xmath39 branch is the amplitude or the gapped branch with the property that @xmath40 as @xmath10 , @xmath41 . for a bose gas in an optical lattice it was shown that the gap is exactly @xmath42 @xcite . the above result is independent of the fact whether @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 or @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath45 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we now consider a bose gas confined in an optical lattice .",
    "we ignore the parabolic confining potential and write down the corresponding bose - hubbard hamiltonian in the spirit of the bogoliubov approximation as in the previous section    @xmath48(a_{j , q}^{\\dagger}a_{j , q}+a_{j ,- q}^{\\dagger } a_{j ,- q } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & t\\sum_{j , q ( q \\neq 0 ) } [ ( a_{j , q}^{\\dagger } a_{j+1,q}+a_{j , q}^{\\dagger } a_{j-1,q})+(a_{j ,- q}^{\\dagger } a_{j+1,-q}+a_{j ,- q}^{\\dagger } a_{j-1,-q } ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\tilde n u \\sum_{j , q ( q \\neq 0 ) } ( a_{j , q}^{\\dagger } a_{j ,- q}^{\\dagger}+a_{j , q } a_{j ,- q}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath49 are the onsite energies , @xmath15 is the hopping parameter and @xmath50 is the total number of sites .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath51 and @xmath52 is    @xmath53    @xmath54    ,    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath57 . again",
    "a transformation of the type @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the lattice spacing ) yields the bogoliubov mode for the bose - hubbard hamiltonian    @xmath62}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath63 as @xmath10 . similarly the transformations @xmath64 and @xmath59 splits the bogoliubov mode into two modes    @xmath65    @xmath66    the amplitude mode @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 as @xmath10 .",
    "note that the above theory makes use of the `` breaking of symmetry '' in frequency space to separate the amplitude mode from the phase mode .",
    "take for example the uniform bose gas .",
    "the terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 evolve under the transformation @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath72 and @xmath73 . on the other hand , the transformations @xmath35 and @xmath31 yield @xmath72 and @xmath74 , indicating a breaking of symmetry due to a two - photon process .",
    "such asymmetry can be created by exposing the bec to two counter - propagating bragg pulses such that the atoms undergo two - photon process and the amplitude mode can be detected only at higher bragg frequency @xcite .",
