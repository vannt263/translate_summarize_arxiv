    "glass display a number of universal properties which can not be found in crystalline solids , not only below the temperatures of 1k , but also between 1k and 30k@xcite .",
    "these properties were first well studied by zeller and pohl@xcite like low temperature heat capacity and thermal conductivity . in 1972 , anderson , halperin and varma group@xcite and phillips@xcite independently set up a model which was later named tunneling - two - level system ( ttls ) . together with a certain random distribution the parameter of it@xcite , this model not only successfully explained existing experiments such as linear temperature dependence of heat capacity , but also predict new experiments such as phonon echo@xcite and saturation@xcite phenomena .",
    "the original experiment of phonon echo phenomena is to plug in two short ultrasonic pulses with identical frequency @xmath1ghz@xcite and a time delay between them @xmath2s .",
    "after the reflection of sample s boundary , we observe two reflecting signals . however , after the second pulse with a time delay of @xmath3 we observe a third one with the same frequency @xmath4 .",
    "this spontaneously generated pulse which was later referred to as  phonon echo \" can not be observed in crystalline solids .",
    "phonon echo experiment is similar to spin echo@xcite , in which we plug in two magnetic pulses to precess a set of spins .",
    "such a spins system will spontaneously generate a huge magnetic signal following the second input magnetic pulse with the magnitude comparable to it .",
    "phonon echo can be automatically explained within ttls model by making analogy to spin echo effect , because both of two - level - system hamiltonian and the coupling between two - level - system and phonon strain field can be represented by pauli matrices .",
    "d. a. parshin and his collaborators@xcite has derived a complete theory beyond two - level - system , that for an arbitrary multiple - level - system with randomness and anharmonicity , one can always obtain phonon echo phenomena . in this paper by setting up the coupling btween stress tensor and phonon strain field , we prove that phonon echo essentially comes from off - diagonal matrix elements of stress tensor operators in the basis of glass non - elastic part of hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , we prove that the mechnism when phonon echo occurs is stimulated phonon emission process rather than spontaneous emission process which explains why echo signal is comparable to input ultrasonic pulses .",
    "saturation experiment@xcite is to plug in two phonon pulses .",
    "unlike phonon echo , the first  saturating pulse \" is much stronger than the second  testing pulse \" .",
    "the second testing pulse is plugged in with a time delay much smaller than thermal relaxation time of ttls . since the energy level structure of amorphous solid",
    "is the summation of long - wavelength phonon modes and a set of ttls , putting in a strong  saturating pulse \" will saturate these two - level - systems , resulting in the large decrease of attenuation @xmath5 , implying that the phonon absorption ability is saturated by the first strong pulse . within ttls model energy eigenstates",
    "can go no more than first excitation so that saturation effect is automaticallly proved . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate even for infinite - level - system we can still find saturation effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we develop our infinite - level - system by expanding amorphous non - elastic hamiltonian in orders of strain field @xmath6 ; in section 3 we prove that phonon echo only occurs when stimulated emission process happens .",
    "we compare different cases and demonstrate randomness and nonlinearity are necessary for phonon echo , while for an arbitrary system without randomness or nonlinearity phonon echo never exists ; in section 4 we prove not only for finite - level - system but also for quantum infinite - level - system , phonon saturation can be found with the presence of nonlinearity , while for classical infinite - level - system ( with @xmath0 limit ) we can never find saturation phenomena . in conclusion phonon saturation is a result of quantum physics . with these results we can roughly describe the energy structure of amorphous solid hamiltonian",
    "due to ttls theory , the amorphous solid hamiltonian is the summation of elastic ( phonon ) hamiltonian , a set of tunneling - two - level - systems and phonon - ttls couplings@xcite . because we are interested in ttls , usually we omit phonon part hamiltonian . in the basis",
    "when ttls is diagonalized , the hamiltonian for amorphous solid is written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is phonon strain ; @xmath9 are pauli matrix representations ; @xmath10 is the ttls energy splitting , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are ttls diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements at position @xmath13 . for different positions @xmath13 they are randomly distributed ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of ttls - phonon coupling ; @xmath16 is the coupling constant between ttls and phonon strain which is also randomly distributed over space @xmath13 . since",
    "the hamiltonian is written in the representation of spin operators , one can easily prove  phonon echo \" by making analogy to spin echo effect which was first observed by hahn@xcite . on the other hand ttls can go no higher than first excitation , j@xmath17ckle pointed out that phonon energy absorption per unit time is maximized when ttls ground state and first excitation population are equally distributed with @xmath18 . because for an arbitrary two - level - system with certain randomness in their matrix elements echo effect always exists , and for an arbitrary finite - level - system one can always prove saturation phenomena , in this paper we are interested in proving them in arbitrary infinite - level - system .",

    "other amorphous solids electric dipole interactions are even smaller .    in conclusion , many body interaction @xmath61 decoherence is not strong enough to affect the wavefunction coherence of mutiple - level - system . in the rest of this paper",

    "if one @xmath96-th state accidentally emits phonon and relaxes back to state @xmath65 with phase @xmath150 , then the emitting phonon phase @xmath151 has 9 possibilities : @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 .",

    "we observe a strong echo signal spontaneously generated by amorphous sample .",
    "it seems echo phenomena has been explained within spontaneous emission process .",
    "however the fact that echo amplitude is comparable to input pulse leads to several questions : ( 1 ) state @xmath96 can not only go back to state @xmath65 , but also relax to other states @xmath168 ; ( 2 ) the choice of state @xmath65 phase @xmath140 is arbitrary , only a small fraction of @xmath140 equals to @xmath144 ; ( 3 ) thermal relaxation time @xmath73 is so huge that spontaneous emission is still negligible , regardless of phonon phase coherence . with these considerations we demonstrate instead of spontaneous emission process",
    ", echo signal comes from stimulated emission process which makes the amplitude comparable to input pulses . at @xmath149 , as long as one phonon emitted from @xmath166 levels with frequency @xmath169 and phase @xmath167 is occasionally emitted , other energy level pairs @xmath170 next to it with @xmath171 get stimulated and emit phonons with the same phase and roughly the same frequency within deviation @xmath172 .",
    "the importance of pulse decay rate @xmath88 is that it largely increases stimulated emission chance .",
    "the more phonons emitted , the more energy level pairs get stimulated .",
    "eventually the entire set of level pairs emit phonons simultaneously all over the space .",
    "echo signal amplitude is therefore comparable to input pulses .    from the above discussions we see why the energy level randomness over spacial coordinate @xmath173 of @xmath66 , and the energy level nonlinearity ( energy levels",
    "are not equally spaced ) play the central role in echo phenomena .",
    "suppose we have a hamiltonian @xmath174 with nonlinearity but without randomness , and another hamiltonian with randomness but without nonlinearity .",
    "first , the system without randomness has a set of infinite - level - systems with identical energy level structures .",
    "when the first pulse is plugged in all energy level pairs @xmath130 in resonance with ultrasonic frequency @xmath93 are excited beyond thermal equilibrium , with the same frequencies @xmath127 over space @xmath173 . right after the first pulse as long as one phonon is spontaneously emitted ,",
    "the entire @xmath130 level pairs get stimulated instantly .",
    "no phonon energy stored in infinite - level - system and echo can not be observed .",
    "second , for a system without nonlinearity in level structure , i.e. , the energy levels of @xmath66 are equally spaced , if we plug in an ultrasonic pulse either the entire energy levels absorb phonons , or none of them can . only a set of input frequencies with @xmath175 can be absorbed , where @xmath176 is the energy spacing of infinite - level - system and @xmath65 is integer .",
    "the absorption spectrum width is so narrow ( of order @xmath177 ) that experimentally it is almost unrealizable .",
    "even if infinite - level - system successfully absorb phonons , phonon echo still canot exist since as long as one phonon is spontaneously emitted from a certain pair of levels , other level pairs will get stimulated simultaneously .",
    "finally , it is obvious that echo effect does not exist in any system without randomness and nonlinearity .",
    "phonon saturation is obvious for arbitrary finite - level - system because the energy levels are capped . in this section",
    "our purpose is to prove saturation in infinite - level - system with increasing energy spacing .",
    "it is impossible to prove saturation effect with decreasing energy spacing , for example , hydrogen atom with energy level @xmath178 can be ionized if the imcoming photon energy exceeds @xmath179ev .",

    "however , instead of a closed form , a chaotic solution@xcite emerges for inhomogeneous equation of motion for sinusoidal force @xmath183 .",
    "although we can not get an analytical solution , the qualitative behavior of the amplitude of chaotic solution @xmath184 continuously grows with the increase of @xmath185 , which means no saturation exists in classical duffing oscillator . instead of numerical analysis from t. k. nagy and b.",
