    "transport of waves in complex media has been studied for many decades , even though many fundamental or applicative questions are still under debate such as imaging through optical thick samples  @xcite or anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "light propagation in turbid media can often be described by a diffusion formalism where photons undergo a random walk process with a step - size distribution @xmath7 vanishing faster than @xmath8 at infinity . in that case",
    "the central limit theorem applies and the mean - square displacement of photons is proportional to time .",
    "this is typically the case for light in cloudy atmospheres  @xcite or in biological tissues  @xcite .",
    "however , many physical systems can be subdiffusive or superdiffusive depending on the random walk process characteristics  @xcite .",
    "one particular mechanism for superdiffusion is called lvy flights .",
    "the occurrence of lvy flights has been investigated in a large variety of systems , ranging from trajectories of animals  @xcite , human travel  @xcite , turbulence  @xcite , earthquakes  @xcite to solar flares  @xcite . in optics , engineered materials where photons trajectories are described by lvy flights",
    "have been realized recently by stacking glass spheres with a specific size distribution  ( and are thus called lvy glasses )  @xcite . in many of these systems , as in most turbid media relevant in applied physics  @xcite , possible correlations exist between the step - size distribution and the past history of each random trajectory .",
    "these are _ memory effects _ giving rise to correlated random walks which constitute a nuisance on top of the basic lvy signature .",
    "the origin of the correlations can be traced back either to the initial position of the step depending on the underlying topography of the system  ( e.g. quenched disorder in lvy glasses )  @xcite , or alternatively , to correlations in optical frequency in case of inelastic scattering  ( e.g. partial frequency redistribution effects in atomic vapors )  @xcite .",
    "whatever the cause , these correlations are at the root of some limitations in the observation of lvy flights characteristics  @xcite , and it is thus important to look for a system without any of such correlations .    as suggested early on by kenty  @xcite and reformulated later in the context of lvy flights  @xcite , superdiffusion of light is also expected in many different atomic systems ranging from dense atomic vapors , hot plasmas to stars . in this article",
    ", we explore theoretically , numerically and experimentally the propagation of light in a slab containing a hot rubidium gas . this system corresponds to an annealed disorder where no correlation exists between the step - size distribution and the position  @xcite . in an annealed disordered system , statistical properties do not depend on the position and all positions are strictly identical . in a quenched system ,",
    "the position plays a role ( not thermal equilibrium ) and step correlations have to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we worked in a regime of so high temperature for the rubidium vapor  ( between @xmath9 to @xmath10 ) that the assumption of complete frequency redistribution is valid .",
    "this effectively nulify any memory effects associated with inelastic scattering .",
    "additionally , the range of step - size distribution in atomic vapors is only limited by nearest neighbor distances and by the size of the sample , allowing for a huge increase in the dynamics of the signals .",
    "all of these render the atomic vapor in this high temperature regime a good experimental system to study supperdifusion , freed from the added complication of correlated steps sizes .",
    "previous work on lvy flights of light have already been conducted in atomic vapors but these concentrated in the microscopic details : the influence of the microscopic spectral broadening mechanism into the single - step size distribution  @xcite .",
    "all the experimental work done on macroscopically averaged quantities was only phenomenological .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of an analytical connection between the microscopic lvy parameter and the macroscopically measurable observables , for superdiffusion .    in our theoretical approach ,",
    "we derive a transport equation from first principles ( microscopic approach starting from maxwell equations ) and with controlled approximations .",
    "this equation describes the incoherent propagation of radiation inside a gas consisting of two - level atoms at high temperature . solving this integro - differential equation using a monte carlo technique allows us to obtain both the intensity profile @xmath5 at the exit surface of the sample as well as the total diffuse transmission @xmath11 a careful analytical analysis of the integro - differential equation also leads us to an analytical expression for the step - size distribution @xmath7 , which we use to obtain an analytical prediction for the power law decrease of @xmath5 which is directly related to the lvy exponent @xmath6 .",
    "in an experiment using a slab geometry with hot rubidium atoms , we have measured the total diffuse transmission @xmath4 and the transmitted intensity profile @xmath5 , both in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the large dynamic range of the experiment data provides a reliable measurement for the lvy exponent @xmath6 , measured in single shot images under multiple scattering conditions and is very close to the result obtained in a previous study based on the microscopic step - size distribution of light in the system  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in part  [ 1st_part ] , we derive a transport equation for light propagating in hot atomic vapors and stress several signatures of lvy flights encoded in this equation by comparing to the classical case . in part",
    "[ 2nd_part ] , we present the experiment in a hot cell of rubidium gas and show that the experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions , for superdiffusion in an annealed disorder system .",
    "we start the derivation of the transport equation for light in atomic clouds with the polarizability of the atoms described by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the detuning , @xmath14 the resonance frequency , @xmath15 the linewidth and @xmath16 the wavevector .",
    "this expression is valid for a two - level atom far from saturation and does not take into account the multilevel structure of the real atoms considered in the experiment . from this building block and from first principles ( maxwell equations ) ,",

    "our main goal is to characterize unambiguously the lvy regime , emphasising its qualitative difference from standard diffusion .",
    "we therefore tried to address the following question :  what is the asymptotic in the multiple scattering regime in the spatial radial profile for standard diffusion ?",
    "is it exponential ( possibly mimicking a single step step - size distribution ) ; or alternatively , is it gaussian ( mimicking the gaussian propagator in infinite media ) ? in trying to address this question we derived an analytical representation of the radial profiles in the slab for both transmission and reflection .",
    "this indeed gives a quasi - exponential asymptotic for standard diffusion , thus emphasizing an important physical insight .",
    "the qualitative nature of the single - step distribution still survives in the multi scattering regime : a lvy signature can be inferred from a power law in the radial profile and a exponential radial dependence is the asymptotic signature of standard diffusion .",

    "the asymptotic valid for large distances from the center ( please remember that it is exactly this asymptotic behaviour that we sough ) is easily obtained .",
    "the asymptotic for each term is  @xcite : @xmath104 for large distances , only the first term of the series survives and the asymptotic is approximately exponential [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] .",
    "what emerges is an approximate exponential asymptotic for both the transmitted and reflected radial profiles .",
    "this quasi - exponential asymptotic can be interpreted as the signature of standard diffusion in the slab .",
    "this dependence is present in the analytical solution of the diffusion equation , as well as in the solution of the radiative transfer equation , not restricted to the diffusion approximation  @xcite .",
    "although the exponential asymptotic is only approximate , the  @xmath105 dependence is weak and in all practical situations a log - lin plot gives an easy graphical criteria to identify a diffusion - like asymptotic [ see fig .",

    "we use the monte carlo data to illustrate the inability of the gaussian to adequately describe the data ( also true for the experimental data ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] is important since it shows perfect agreement with the diffusion prediction of eq .",
    "( [ diff_eq_solution ] ) , but also because it shows that the difference of a gaussian to the analytical model is accessible in an actual experiment ( our experimental setup easily access two to four orders of magnitude ; the standard practice of plotting the profile in lin scale makes the disagreement with the gaussian much less evident ) .",
    "it is also operational important since it dismiss any possible artifacts in the monte carlo general scheme ( the general framework in which the monte carlo of the lvy flight , a far from trivial code , is constructed ) . and illustrates a simple graphical procedure to diagnose the qualitative signature of the data :  a log - lin plot will signal diffusion , a log - log plot a power law ( see fig .",

    "additional technicalities of the fitting algorithm and limitations are given in appendix  [ appendix - diffusion ] .",
    "the quality of the fit and the good agreement of the monte carlo data and the diffusion model illustrate that , at least for aspect ratios not smaller than the ones used in this work ( for milk the ratio of slab width to diameter is roughly  @xmath110 ) , the diffusion model assuming an infinite slab is an adequate description of an actual experiment ( please remember that both analytical model and monte carlo correspond to an infinite slab ; actual experiment is always finite ) .    ) .",

    "an important physical insight can be stressed at this point .",
    "altough the actual details of standard and anomalous diffusion can be quite involved , their microscopic physical signature survives in the asymptotics of steady state in a strongly multiple scattering regime : standard diffusion with an exponential single step distribution gives rise to asymptoticaly exponential spatial profiles ( and not to gaussian profiles , as one might guess from the gaussian propagator in infinite media ) while a single step power law lvy will reveal itself as a power law in the multiple step spatial profile .",
    "this insight is important since the fundamental nature of diffusion can be investigated in multiple scattering conditions , usually much easier to access than the corresponding single scattering counterparts .",

    "indeed , a small dof results in a diffractive type power tail in the detected image of light scattered from an object beyond the dof . even though the power in the pedestal of our dfb laser only represents about of the power of the laser , this can limit the possibility to detect the relevant power law tails under consideration .",
    "this effect would be a crucial limititation to the light scattered by the atoms at large distances .",
