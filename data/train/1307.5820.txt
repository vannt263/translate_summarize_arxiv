    "rr  lyrae stars are particularly valuable for stellar evolution studies because they are in an advanced ( post - rgb ) evolutionary stage and therefore serve to improve our understanding of mass loss , convection , rotation and magnetic fields .",
    "one of their primary uses has been for distance estimation using an absolute magnitude , metallicity relation ( see sandage 1981 ) .",

    "it now seems clear that the more metal - rich rr  lyr stars have lower luminosities than their more metal - poor counterparts , at least for those stars near the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) that are not evolved away from the zahb .",
    "another astrophysical problem of great interest is the unsolved blazhko effect ( see kovcs 2009 , buchler & kollth 2011 ) .",
    "whatever the eventual explanation , the correct model will undoubtedly be subject to observational constraints such as are currently being provided by the konkoly and vienna blazhko star surveys , and the high - precision , long - timeline photometry from the most , corot and _ kepler _ space telescopes , as well as from ground - based follow - up surveys .",

    "k11 studied rr  lyrae itself in great detail using q1-q2 long cadence data .",
    "the n11 study consisted of an extensive fourier decomposition analysis ( using q0-q5 _ kepler _ photometry ) of 19 non - blazhko _ kepler_-field rrab stars . and most recently , g12 studied in detail the most extreme blazhko star , v445  lyr .",

    "the primary goal of the present investigation was to derive spectroscopic [ fe / h]@xmath17 abundances ( and the corresponding atmospheric parameters ) for the _ kepler_-field rr  lyrae stars .",
    "prior to the current investigation only photometric [ fe / h]@xmath18 values were known for the 19 non - blazhko stars studied by n11 ; and neither spectroscopic nor photometric abundances had been measured for the rrc and blazhko stars ( a notable exception being rr  lyrae itself ) .",
    "the reliability of the n11 photometric metallicities , especially for the four non - blazhko stars identified as probable metal - rich old - disk stars , was of particular interest .",
    "thus , a secondary goal was to confirm the _ kepler_-based [ fe / h]@xmath18 values for the non - blazhko stars , and to use the longer time frame of the q0-q11 _ kepler _ photometry ( approaching 1000 days of quasi - continuous measurements ) and the improved _ kepler _ pipeline to derive [ fe / h]@xmath18 abundances for the blazhko and rrc stars .",
    "with [ fe / h]@xmath17 and [ fe / h]@xmath18 measurements in hand , a comparison of the metal abundances was possible .",
    "the good agreement found between the spectroscopic and photometric abundances suggests that high - precision photometry alone can be used to derive iron - to - hydrogen ratios , thereby providing a reliable means for the derivation of metallicities for stars too faint for high - dispersion spectroscopy .    in @xmath19",

    "the periods were computed with the ` period04 ' package of lenz & breger ( 2005 ) using the monte carlo mode for error estimation , stellingwerf s ( 1978 ) ` pdm2 ' program , updated to deal with rich data sets , and the period - finding program of kolaczkowski ( see moskalik & kolaczkowski 2009 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the pulsation periods reported in table  1 is @xmath6few units in the last decimal place given , with the periods for the blazhko and rrc stars tending to be less accurate than those for the non - blazhko stars .",
    "the uncertainties depend on several factors : the particular data set ( or subset ) that was analyzed , the search method , the constancy of the primary pulsation period , and whether or not amplitude or frequency modulations are present . in general",
    "the periods agree well with those given by b10 for 15 non - blazhko and 14 blazhko stars , and with the more precise values derived by n11 for 19 non - blazhko stars . since the new periods were computed with longer time baselines than these earlier studies , and are based on both long and short cadence data , they are the best available values yet reported for these stars . in general , the accuracy of the @xmath63 values is more than sufficient for estimating the phases at which the spectroscopic observations were made .",
    "the @xmath65 in table  1 are the trough - to - peak _ kp _ amplitudes . for the non - blazhko stars they are time invariant values obtained by inspection of the complete light curve and by averaging @xmath65 calculated from individual light curves for successive time segments ( see fig.2 ) . for the blazhko variables and the four rrc stars , all of which are multiperiodic and show amplitude variations , @xmath65 is the time - averaged value . according to the transformation given in equation 2 of n11 the @xmath65(_kp",

    "the zero points @xmath64 were estimated from the mean light curves and correspond to times of zero - slope at maximum light .",
    "for the non - blazhko stars they were usually chosen to approximately coincide with the time of the first _ kepler _ observations ( _ i.e. _ , just after bjd 2454953 ) , and for the blazhko variables the @xmath64 generally coincide with a time of maximum light occuring during a period of maximum amplitude .",
    "thus , @xmath64 serves as the zero point for both the pulsation phase , @xmath82 , defined to be the fractional part of @xmath83 , and for the blazhko phase , @xmath84 , defined to be the fractional part of @xmath85 .",
    "the most noticeable signature of the blazhko effect is variation in the light curve shape , in particular amplitude modulations , over time scales ranging from several days to several years .",
    "the amplitude that is usually considered is the total amplitude ( _ i.e. _ , from trough to peak ) through the @xmath80 or @xmath86 filter , but may also be one of the fourier amplitude coefficients . in the absence of @xmath87 photometry for most of the _ kepler_-field rr  lyr stars we focus in this paper on the @xmath65 and @xmath66 amplitudes derived from the _ kp _ photometry .",
    "the @xmath66 values are from fourier decompositions of the _ kp _ data performed using the following sine - series sum : @xmath88 where m(t ) is the apparent _ kp _ magnitude as a function of time , @xmath89 is the mean _ kp _ magnitude ( assumed to be the value given in the kic catalog ) , @xmath90 is the adopted number of terms in the fourier series , the @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the fourier amplitudes and phases , and @xmath4 is the pulsation period .",
    "blazhko stars are also known to exhibit period ( frequency , or phase ) modulations , although usually these are less noticeable than the amplitude modulations .",
    "frequency modulations were detected previously in the _",
    "kepler_-field blazhko stars studied by b10 , in rr  lyrae by k10 and k11 , and in v445  lyr by g12 .",
    "the 16 _ kepler_-field blazhko stars studied here all exhibit both amplitude and frequency modulations .    while the detection of amplitude and frequency modulations is usually straightforward , the physical mechanism responsible remains unknown , and blazhko stars are almost as enigmatic now ( see kovcs 2009 ) as when they were discovered over 100 years ago ( blazhko 1907 ) .",
    "the problem in recent years has taken on new significance with the discovery that almost half of all rrab stars are blazhko variables ( jurcsik _ et al . _",
    "2009c ) , and that possibly all rrc stars are multiperiodic ( moskalik _ et al .",
    "these discoveries raise the question whether all rr  lyrae stars might be amplitude and frequency modulators .",
    "the measured amplitude and frequency modulations for the blazhko rrab stars in our sample are summarized in * table  2 * , where the stars have been ordered from largest to smallest amplitude modulations , @xmath93 ( _ i.e. _ , from the most extreme blazhko variability to the least variability ) .",
    "all the quantities are newly - derived from both the long and short cadence q0-q11 photometry , and the uncertainties are at the level of the precisions given .",

    "the amplitude modulations , @xmath94 , range from as large as @xmath60.82 mag ( v445  lyr , v2178  cyg ) to as small as @xmath60.02 mag ( v838  cyg , kic11125706 ) , corresponding to 2 - 80% of @xmath65(max ) .",
    "the stars with the largest amplitude variations tend also to exhibit the largest period variations .",
    "the average period range @xmath95 is 0.0010d .",
    "plots of @xmath94 versus period , and @xmath99 versus period , show an approximately normal distribution with the largest modulations occuring for those stars with pulsation periods around 0.53d . in the period-@xmath99 diagram the extreme blazhko stars v445  lyr and v2178  cyg ( see fig.3 ) are clearly outliers with @xmath99 values considerably larger than for all the other blazhko stars .",
    "estimates of @xmath95 and @xmath93 of rr  lyrae by k11 , and v445lyr by g12 , agree well with the values reported in table  2 .      when the amplitude modulations of blazhko stars are very small careful analysis is required to ensure that the fluctuations are not artificial , perhaps caused by the data reduction methods .",
    "such borderline blazhko stars among the _ kepler_-field rr  lyr stars include kic11125706 , v838  cyg and v349  lyr ( discussed by n11 ) .",
    "previously , kic11125706 was found by b10 to have `` the lowest amplitude modulation ever detected in an rr  lyrae star '' , even smaller than the small amplitude modulations seen in rr  gem ( jurcsik _ et al .",

    "the two stars are considerably different in that v838  cyg has a much higher amplitude and shorter period than kic11125706 ( @xmath101mag vs. 0.47mag ; @xmath102d vs. 0.61d ; see fig .  4 below ) .",

    "the plotted variables are ( from bottom to top ) : the amplitude @xmath66 and the phase @xmath103 , both from the first term in the fourier sine series ; the ratio @xmath104 of the second and first fourier amplitudes ; and the fourier phase difference parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "the four variables were obtained by dividing the long cadence data from q1 to q11 into time segments , each segment corresponding to three pulsation periods ( _ cf .",

    "for both stars the mid - times and blazhko phases of the respective cfht spectra are indicated ( labelled red vertical lines ) , as are the adopted @xmath64 zero points ( labelled blue vertical lines ) .",
    "for kic11125706 the large gaps at @xmath105=253 - 323 and at @xmath105=600 - 688 are because no observations were made in the second two months of q4 and in q8 .",
    "for the same star the blue open squares result from analysis of the 126955 short cadence photometric measurements made in q7  agreement of the short and long cadence results is excellent .",
    "the modulation periods are obvious and seen to be close to 55d for v838  cyg , and 40d for kic11125706  these are the basic blazhko periods .",
    "in addition to the amplitude modulations seen in the @xmath66 and @xmath104 panels , the variation of @xmath103 is indicative of frequency modulation . that the time - series plots for @xmath103 and @xmath5 ( which measures the pulse shape ) are mirror images of each other is not uncommon ( but not always the case , as is seen for v2178  cyg in fig.3 below ) .    on relatively short time scales , such as the @xmath690 day baseline of the available sc",

    "thus the amplitude and frequency modulations are complex .",
    "a `` period04 '' frequency analysis of the long cadence data identified multiple blazhko periods of 54 , 64 and 47 days , the first being the most significant . finally , the cycle - to - cycle amplitude variations seen in the bottom right panel suggest that additional amplitude modulations may be present for kic11125705 .",

    "the early studies by oosterhoff ( 1939 , 1944 ) , arp ( 1955 ) and preston ( 1959 ) established that in the period - amplitude diagram for rr  lyrae stars there is a separation by metal abundance , with metal - poor rrab stars tending to have longer pulsation periods at a given amplitude than metal - rich rrab stars .",
    "this effect has been used to better understand the oosterhoff dichotomy and to derive metallicities for rr lyrae stars found in different environments , such as in globular clusters ( sandage 1981 , 1990 , 2004 ; cacciari _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) , in different fields of our galaxy , and in other galaxies . the effect is now known to be due to the lower metal abundance stars having greater luminosities and therefore longer periods ( see sandage 2010 ; bono _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) , a result which is consistent with the recent warsaw convective pulsation hydro - models ( see fig.14 of n11 ) .    in the 1980 s simon and his collaborators introduced fourier",
    "decomposition techniques for describing the shapes of rr  lyr light curves , and established useful correlations between various fourier parameters and [ fe / h ] , mass , luminosity , and other physical parameters ( simon & lee 1981 ; simon & teays 1982 ; simon 1985 , 1988 ; simon & clement 1993 ) .",
    "since the mid-1990 s kovcs and jurcsik and their collaborators ( kovcs & zsoldos 1995 ; jurcsik & kovcs 1996 , hereafter jk96 ; kovcs & jurcsik 1996 ; kovcs & walker 2001 ; kovcs 2005 ) have expanded upon these fourier ideas and have produced useful empirical equations that describe the relationships between rrab light curve parameters and physical characteristics .",
    "in particular , jk96 derived a @xmath4-@xmath5-[fe / h ] relation ( their equation 3 ) which is often used to estimate the metallicities of rrab stars . more recently , morgan _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 , hereafter m07 ) derived analogous equations for rrc stars .    in * fig .  4 *",
    "the @xmath136-@xmath65 and @xmath136-@xmath5 diagrams are plotted for the _ kepler_-field rrab stars .",
    "the pulsation periods , @xmath65(_kp _ ) and @xmath5(_kp _ ) are the new values given in table  1 , and the diagrams include both non - blazhko ( black squares ) and blazhko stars ( red open squares ) . by reversing the direction of the @xmath5 axis one observes directly the similarity of the two diagrams ( see sandage 2004 ) and that those stars with the largest amplitudes tend to have the most asymmetric light curves , _ i.e. _ , the smallest @xmath137 values . in both diagrams",
    "all but a few of the most crowded points have been labelled with the star names .",
    "for the two most extreme blazhko stars , v445  lyr and v2178  cyg , the @xmath5 ranges exceed the range of the plotted y - axis .",
    "the rrc stars in the _ kepler _ field are off - scale to the left of both graphs , with small amplitudes , large @xmath5 values , and periods shorter than 0.4d .",
    "several trends are apparent in fig.4 , the most obvious being the similarity of the two diagrams .",
    "there is also an apparent separation of the stars into two groups , discriminated better by @xmath63 and @xmath5 than by @xmath63 and @xmath65 .",
    "most of the stars are observed to have @xmath65@xmath760.8mag and @xmath137@xmath775.4radians . according to the metallicity correlations mentioned above these",
    "are metal - poor stars with [ fe / h]@xmath77@xmath138dex .",
    "the other group , those shorter - period stars with lower amplitudes and higher @xmath5 values , are expected to be more metal - rich , with [ fe / h]@xmath76@xmath138dex . for a fixed metallicity",
    "as the pulsation period increases the stars tend to have smaller amplitudes and more sinusoidal light curves ( _ i.e. _ , smaller @xmath137 values ) .    when all the stars in a given sample are suspected of having the same or similar metallicities ( e.g. , in globular clusters with narrow red giant branches ) , or when there exist independent spectroscopic metal abundances for the sample stars , then diagonal lines can be fit to the observational data ( e.g. , sandage 2004 , cacciari _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 , n11 ) .",
    "such diagonal trends are evident in the fig.4 @xmath136-@xmath5 diagram , especially when the spectroscopic standard stars ( blue crosses ) are included in the diagram .",
    "this diagram also suggests that the new non - blazhko star v839  cyg , and the low - amplitude - modulation star kic11125706 ( fig.2 ) are metal rich .",
    "indeed , we show below that v839  cyg is metal - rich , with [ fe / h]=@xmath139 dex ; however , the cfht spectra of kic11125706 , with [ fe / h]=@xmath140 dex ( see table  7 ) , indicate that it probably belongs to the metal - poor group .",
    "the blazhko stars require special consideration .",
    "they are represented in fig.4 by their mean pulsation periods and their mean @xmath65 or @xmath5 values ( red open squares ) , with vertical lines spanning the measured ranges of @xmath65 and @xmath5 .",
    "if metal abundances are derived by substituting the mean @xmath5 values given in table  1 into the jk96 @xmath4-@xmath5-[fe / h ] relation , then the resulting photometric [ fe / h ] values suggest that almost all of the blazhko variables are metal - poor ; indeed , this is supported by the spectroscopic metallicities ( next section ) , and runs contrary to the suggestion by moskalik & poretti ( 2003 ) that the incidence of blazhko variables increases with [ fe / h ] .",
    "also , since the blazhko stars appear to have , at a given period , lower mean @xmath65 values and higher mean @xmath137 values than the non - blazhko stars , it appears that the _ kepler _ blazhko stars must be more metal - rich , on average , than the non - blazhko stars .",
    "the validity of these conclusions depends on the applicability of the jk96 formula , and on the appropriateness of the assumed @xmath5 values , the latter being particularly true for the most extreme blazhko stars ( v445  lyr , v2178  cyg ) where the @xmath5 show large modulations .",
    "these topics will be discussed further in @xmath22 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic observations were made of the _ kepler_-field rr  lyrae stars using the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m telescope ( cfht ) and the keck - i 10-m telescope ( w.m . keck observatory ) , both located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "a total of 123 spectra were taken of 42 stars and in most cases the derived spectroscopic metal abundances are the first available estimates .",
    "since a primary goal of this study was derivation of [ fe / h]@xmath17 values , spectra were taken at pulsation phases between @xmath60.2 and @xmath60.5 , at the changeover from outflow to infall . away from these phases the spectra are increasingly affected by velocity - gradients in the atmosphere and shock waves that broaden the spectral lines ( see preston 2009 , 2011 ; k11 ; for _ et al .",
    "the pulsation phases for the mid - times of the individual spectra are given in tables 4 - 5 below and were derived using the updated pulsation periods and @xmath64 values that were calculated using q0-q11 photometry .",
    "nearly @xmath141 of the spectra were acquired at phases between 0.25 and 0.55 ( see upper panel of * fig.5 * ) .",
    "the overall median and mean @xmath82 are 0.35 and 0.38 , respectively , with @xmath142 ; the mean @xmath82 for the 54 keck spectra is larger than that for the 68 cfht spectra ( 0.48 vs. 0.30 ) .",

    "we use the accurate pulsation periods and fourier light curve parameters presented in @xmath6303 , and the spectroscopic metal abundances derived in @xmath21 , to derive new @xmath4-@xmath23-[fe / h ] regressions for the _ kepler_-field rrab and rrc stars . using our fitted models we estimate [ fe / h]@xmath18 for the program stars and investigate the applicability of the models to blazhko and non - blazhko stars . because the spectroscopic [ fe / h ] values are derived from high dispersion spectra analyzed using standard reduction procedures , the derived metallicities are on the scale of the high dispersion spectroscopy ( _ i.e. _ , the carretta _",
    "_ 2009 , hereafter c9 scale ) .",
    "several models were evaluated for the _ kepler_-field rrab stars and the optimum fit was achieved with the following nonlinear model : @xmath631 = b_0 + b_1 p +   b_2 \\phi_{31}^s + b_3 \\phi_{31}^s p + b_4 ( \\phi_{31}^s)^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the mean @xmath5(_kp _ ) value and [ fe / h ] is the vwa spectroscopic value ( see table  7 ) .",
    "excluded from the final calibration were five blazhko stars with large residuals : v445  lyr and v2178  cyg , both of which exhibit extremely large amplitude and frequency modulations ( see table  2 , and right side of fig.3 ) , and kic11125706 , v838cyg and v1104cyg , which have small amplitude and frequency modulations ( see table  2 , figs.2 - 3 and @xmath632 ) . also excluded from the calibration were two non - blazhko stars with unreliable metallicities , v346lyr and v1510cyg .",

    "the largest metallicity differences correspond to the five blazhko stars excluded from the calibration .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that the two most extreme blazhko stars ( v445  lyr , v2178  cyg ) showed the greatest disagreement .",
    "since both stars exhibit considerable variation in @xmath5 over a blazhko cycle , and since the calibration model ( eqn.2 ) is nonlinear , it is questionable ( jensen s inequality ) whether substitution of mean @xmath23 rather than averaging the ` instantaneous ' [ fe / h ] values is the appropriate way of calculating [ fe / h]@xmath18 .",
    "the [ fe / h]@xmath18 given in table  1 were calculated using the first ( _ i.e. _ , substitution of mean-@xmath5 ) method . to investigate the second method we computed [ fe / h]@xmath18 for the five blazhko stars by averaging ( over complete blazhko cycles ) the metal abundances evaluated ( eqn.2 ) at each ` instant ' along the @xmath5 time series .",
    "as expected , the two methods gave similar results for the three low amplitude / frequency modulators .",
    "however , for v445  lyr and v2178  cyg averaging over the instantaneous abundances gave [ fe / h]@xmath18 = @xmath642 and @xmath540dex , respectively , both of which are much closer to the spectroscopic abundances : @xmath537dex for v445  lyr ( which is from the sme analysis since the vwa analysis was inconclusive ) , and @xmath377dex for v2178  cyg .    of course",
    "the spectroscopic metallicities are also uncertain and contribute to the differences .",
    "four of the five blazhko stars seem to have reliable ( and consistent ) metal abundances from the vwa and sme analyses . the largest difference , that for v445  lyr ( fig.11 ) , was calculated assuming the sme abundance , @xmath537dex ( which appears to be consistent with the partial spectrum shown in fig.7a ) . consideration of the pulsation phases at the times of the spectroscopic observations , and of the blazhko properties of the stars , reveal no obvious patterns : the pulsation phases range from 0.31 to 0.43 ; four of the five stars have blazhko periods @xmath650 days , while v2178  cyg has a considerably longer @xmath113=234@xmath13010d ; and the blazhko phases range from 0.32 to 0.82 .",
    "we conclude that since the large metallicity differences found for extreme blazhko stars are reduced when ` instantaneous ' [ fe / h]@xmath18 values are averaged instead of calculated using the mean-@xmath23 method , and that the two methods give the same result for the non - blazhko and less extreme blazhko stars , that this method might be preferrable for future [ fe / h]@xmath18 calculations .    in * fig .",
    "12 * two sets of isometallicity curves have been added to the @xmath4-@xmath23 diagram ( see fig.4 ) .",

    "it was considered optimal after various linear and nonlinear models were investigated , and gives photometic abundances on the hds metallicity scale established by jurcsik ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is applicable for stars meeting the _ compatibility condition _ , @xmath647@xmath773 , a criterion that fails to hold for stars with peculiar light curves , such as certain blazhko variables and rr  lyr stars in advanced evolutionary stages .    in general our nonlinear model and the jk96 model",
    "agree for [ fe / h]@xmath77@xmath138dex , with progressively larger discrepancies occurring as [ fe / h ] decreases .",
    "it is well - known that for the lowest [ fe / h ] stars the jk96 formula gives metallicities too metal - rich by @xmath60.3 dex , the problem having been identified by jk96 themselves and discussed further by nemec ( 2004 ) and smolec ( 2005 ) .",
    "our model appears to correct this problem ( compare the [ fe / h]@xmath648dex curves in fig.12 ) , in part due to the wider inclusion in our sample of stars more metal - poor than @xmath643dex , as well as our use of a nonlinear rather than linear model .",
    "it should also be noted that jk96 adopted a spectroscopic [ fe / h ] of @xmath649 dex for x  ari , whereas the spectroscopic metallicities in table  10 suggest a much lower value , [ fe / h]@xmath6@xmath611dex .",
    "kepler_-field rr lyr stars divide into two groups , those with @xmath5(_kp_)@xmath65 having low metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath77@xmath650 dex , and a high metallicity group with @xmath5(_kp_)@xmath65.7 .",
    "four of the five _ kepler _ stars comprising the latter group were identified as metal - rich by n11 ( v782  cyg , v784  cyg , kic6100702 and v2470cyg ) ; to this group we can now add v839  cyg ( and the keck standard stars v445  oph and sw  and ) .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath23-[fe / h ] relation for rrc stars was investigated previously by m07 .",
    "two nonlinear formulas were derived , one for metallicities on the zw84 scale ( zinn & west 1984 ) and the other for the cg97 scale ( carretta & gratton 1997 ) . for calibration purposes",
    "106 stars in 12 galactic globular clusters were used , with cluster mean metallicities ranging from @xmath651 to @xmath138 dex .    with only four rrc stars in our sample it was not possible to derive independently a similar relation for the _ kepler_-field rrc stars .",
    "we therefore added the _ kepler _ stars to the m07 calibration data set ( kindly sent to us by dr.morgan ) and derived a new relation .",
    "the inclusion of the _ kepler _ stars extends the [ fe / h ] range to considerably higher metallicities .    since most of the data were from the m07 sample we chose to work with @xmath652(@xmath80 ) fourier phase parameters .",
    "the @xmath5(_kp _ ) values for the _ kepler _ stars were transformed to @xmath652(v ) values using equation 2 of n11 , which , while probably not optimal for the hotter rrc stars ( since it was derived for non - blazhko rrab stars ) is all that is presently available ; the sine - to - cosine transformation was made using @xmath653 .",
    "the metallicities assumed for the _ kepler _ stars were those given in table7 , and the [ fe / h ] values assumed for the globular cluster stars were the cluster means given in table a.1 of c9 .",
    "the latter are very similar to the metal abundances adopted by w. harris in the latest edition ( 2010 ) of his on - line catalog of globular cluster parameters ( harris 1996 ) .    using the revised data set and the @xmath652(@xmath80 ) phase parameters we refit the m07 model , @xmath631 = b_0 + b_1 p +   b_2 \\phi_{31}^c +   b_3 \\phi_{31}^c p + b_4 p^2 + b_5 ( \\phi_{31}^c)^2,\\ ] ] where the metallicites are now on the c9 scale . after removing nine outliers ( v17 in m9 ; v26 in ngc6934 ; v27 and v19 in m2 ; v50 in m15 ; v3 , v11 and v14 in ngc4147 ; and kic9453114 ) the estimated model coefficients and their standard errors",

    "<S> thirty - seven of the rr  lyrae stars are fundamental - mode pulsators ( _ i.e. _ , rrab stars ) of which 16 exhibit the blazhko effect . </S>",
    "<S> four of the stars are multiperiodic rrc pulsators oscillating primarily in the first - overtone mode . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic [ fe / h ] values for the 34 stars for which we were able to derive estimates range from @xmath1 ( nr  lyr ) to @xmath2dex ( v784  cyg ) , and for the 19 _ kepler_-field non - blazhko stars studied by nemec _ </S>",
