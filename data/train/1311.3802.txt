    "<S> it should be possible to observe non - linearities directly in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency shift is proportional to @xmath115 @xcite , and is of the order @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the qubit - mediated coupling has another non - linearity that gives rise to a frequency shift in the mechanics and shows up at a lower order . </S>",
    "<S> it can be understood as the change in the photon stark shift ( which depends on the qubit level splitting ) due to the phonon - driven qubit stark shift , and it implies a term of the form @xmath117 . </S>",

    "<S> _ effect of qubit - mediated dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> _ since the qubit and the oscillators are generally hybridized up to a significant amount , it is important to consider the effect of qubit energy relaxation on that of the oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> this can be analyzed with the schrieffer - wolff approach , but now applying the transformation only to the qubit - oscillator part of the setup ( see also the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rates for relaxation or excitation of the mechanical resonator due to the qubit dissipation satisfy @xmath134 here @xmath135 are the bare qubit relaxation / excitation rates , @xmath136 coupling between the qubit and the bath oscillator @xmath137 , and @xmath138 [ b_j^\\dagger(0)+b_j(0)]\\rangle$ ] is the correlator of the qubit bath , chosen diagonal for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> for an equilibrium bath at temperature @xmath139 , these satisfy a detailed balance relation @xmath140 $ ] . using the fluctuation - dissipation relation with a frequency independent susceptibility for the bath correlator ( i.e. , quantum noise increasing linearly with an increasing frequency ) </S>",
    "<S> , we would then get at @xmath141 the induced mechanical dissipation rate @xmath142 , which is likely quite small in practical systems </S>",
    "<S> . however , in the case of charge qubits , one should consider @xmath143 ( flicker ) noise , i.e. , noise increasing linearly with a decreasing frequency . in this case </S>",
    "<S> this relation changes roughly to @xmath144 , which may already become relevant compared to the intrinsic oscillator dissipation at large values of @xmath145 .    in the case of the cavity </S>",
    "<S> , we get similar effects on relaxation and excitation rates by above replacing @xmath119 with @xmath146 or @xmath147 , @xmath148 by @xmath149 , and @xmath1 by @xmath150 . however , a more relevant effect is likely due to pure cavity dephasing seen by a flickering of the cavity frequency due to low - frequency background charge fluctuations in the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> as analyzed in the appendix , the rate for this process in the case @xmath53 and @xmath68 is @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the pure dephasing rate of the qubit . at the optimal operation point , this is of the order of @xmath153 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , using @xmath154 mhz @xcite and @xmath155 @xmath156 , the corresponding added cavity dephasing rate would be of the order of 0.5 mhz , which is already larger than the intrinsic @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as @xmath157 , this does not hinder reaching the limit of strong optomechanical coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the above approach is valid as long as the cavity photon number @xmath158 is not too large , such that phase fluctuations @xmath159 are small compared to @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> typical values are @xmath161 , depending on the cavity impedance . at the upper end of the scale </S>",
    "<S> there are nonlinear corrections to energy of 10 % already at @xmath162 . in spite of the low linear regime , because of the large @xmath0 , optomechanical phenomena are overwhelming already at photon numbers @xmath163 .    summarizing , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a realizable scheme for boosting the optomechanical radiation pressure coupling by several orders of magnitude . </S>",
