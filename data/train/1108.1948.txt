    "<S> particle - in - cell simulations of magnetic reconnection with an @xmath0 current sheet and a mixed background plasma of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ions are completed using physical mass ratios . </S>",
    "<S> four main results are shown . </S>",
    "<S> first , the @xmath1 presence slightly decreases the reconnection rate and the magnetic reconnection evolution depends mainly on the lighter @xmath0 ion species in the presented simulations . </S>",
    "<S> second , the hall magnetic field is characterized by a two - scale structure in presence of @xmath1 ions : it reaches sharp peak values in a small area in proximity of the neutral line , and then decreases slowly over a large region . </S>",
    "<S> third , the two background species initially separate in the outflow region because @xmath0 and @xmath1 ions are accelerated by different mechanisms occurring on different time scales and with different strengths . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , the effect of a guide field on the @xmath1 dynamics is studied : the @xmath1 presence does not change the reconnected flux and all the characteristic features of guide field magnetic reconnection are still present . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the guide field introduces an @xmath1 circulation pattern between separatrices that enhances high @xmath1 density areas and depletes low @xmath1 density regions in proximity of the reconnection fronts . the importance and the validity of these results </S>",
    "<S> are finally discussed . </S>"
