    "dust grains produce extinction and reddening of stellar light from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) ( draine 2003 ) . accurate determination of reddening to a star is vital for reliable derivation of its basic stellar parameters , such as effective temperature and distance .",
    "constructing a 3d galactic extinction map plays an essential role in galactic astronomy , particularly in achieving the driving goals of the lamost spectroscopic survey of the galactic anti - center ( lss - gac ; liu et al .",

    "2006 ) in the near - ir and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",

    "one can detect absorption features from the interstellar medium ( ism ) , particularly the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ; yuan & liu 2012 ) , as well as abnormal stellar absorption / emission lines from chemically particular or active stars .",
    "such method has the advantages that it s straight - forward , model - free and applicable to the majority of stars . combining stellar distances from gaia ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) or from spectro - photometry , one can further map the galactic extinction , extinction laws and dibs in 3d .",
    "if by chance a diffuse nebula falls in the sightline of some targets , lines emitted by the nebula ( e.g. [ o  iii ]  @xmath04959 , 5007 ) will also be recorded and can be used to discover new faint emission line nebulae ( e.g. planetary nebulae and supernova remnants ) in the galaxy ( yuan & liu , submitted ) .",
    "finally , the technique can also be used to perform photometric calibration for wide field imaging surveys ( yuan et al . in prep ) . in the following sections , we use the cases above to demonstrate the power of the standard pair technique when applied to large scale spectroscopic and photometric datasets including the sdss and on - going lamost surveys .",
