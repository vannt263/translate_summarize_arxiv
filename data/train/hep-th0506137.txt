    "in recent years there has been a renewal of interest in scenarios that propose alternatives or corrections to einstein s four dimensional gravity .",
    "these proposals are of differing origin as well as motivation : some are based on multidimensional theories in which gravity propagates in more than four dimensions ( see for example  @xcite ) , others on scalar - tensor couplings , that could give cosmologically observable effects  @xcite , or violate the equivalence principle  @xcite .",
    "another class of theories modify gravity by adding terms in the lagrangian that depend on quadratic combinations of the riemann tensor ( see for example  @xcite ) , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , yielding higher than second - order field equations . among the applications of such a generalisation we notice that these terms have been used in the past to model inflation  @xcite and dark energy  @xcite .",
    "as it is well - known , there is a unique quadratic combination of the riemann curvature tensor that , if added to the usual einstein - hilbert action , does not increase the differential order of the equations of motion  @xcite . for historical reasons this is called the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term as its geometric origin can be traced back to the gauss - bonnet theorem regarding the euler characteristic of two dimensional surfaces  @xcite .    in classical gravity theories involving dimensions higher than four",
    "there is no good reason to omit it ( apart from complication ) .",
    "studies of higher dimensional gravity , mostly in the context of braneworlds , have shown that such theories have many surprising properties . without trying to be exhaustive",
    ", we can refer to black hole physics  ( e.g.  @xcite ) , gravitational instabilities  ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and the dynamics of co - dimension one and higher braneworlds  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in four dimensions the gauss - bonnet combination reduces to a total divergence and , as such , is dynamically irrelevant .",
    "however , in the case of a scalar - tensor theory ( see for example  @xcite for a detailed and general discussion ) , the gauss - bonnet term couples to the scalar sector and four dimensional gravity is modified ( see also  @xcite for the case of lorentz and chern - simons terms ) . a coupled gauss - bonnet term",
    "should therefore be included in the most general second - order scalar - tensor theory .",
    "such a coupling is manifest if we consider , for example , the case of when the scalar field is a modulus field originating from a kaluza - klein ( kk ) toroidal ( i.e.  flat ) compactification of a @xmath2 dimensional theory .",
    "this is explicitly shown in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "there it is also shown that in order to be consistent with the kk truncation , higher - order scalar field terms must also be included ; a fact that is very often neglected in the literature .",
    "the above discussion about uniqueness of the gauss - bonnet term is , strictly speaking , valid only at the classical level .",
    "however , additional motivation stems from low - energy effective string actions , such as the one for heterotic string theory . at tree level ( for string coupling )",
    "this includes the gauss - bonnet term as the leading order and unique ( up to that order ) ghost - free @xmath3 correction to the einstein - hilbert term  @xcite ( see for example  @xcite for cosmology and braneworld models emanating from such actions ) .",
    "since the coupled gauss - bonnet term is to be naturally included in a scalar - tensor theory , an important question arises : how can current observations constrain such models ?",
    "it has already been shown in the literature that at the background level a coupled gauss - bonnet term allows for a viable cosmology  @xcite . in this article",
    "we address the question of the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations , and see whether interesting constraints can be derived with present or future data .",
    "another , and maybe more stringent way to set up constraints is to look for modifications of gravity on local scales ; parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) analysis  @xcite requires a next to leading order study of slow - moving sources around the earth s gravitational field , or of solar system bodies .",
    "such a study would necessarily be dependent on the details of the gauss - bonnet coupling , since it is dimensionful , and as we will see would be independent of the cosmological expansion .",
    "in fact in this case the relevant background would be that of flat spacetime , or of a modified schwarzschild metric .",
    "this study is beyond the scope of the present paper ( see  @xcite for a first approach in this direction ) and here we will stick to cosmological constraints which are as model free as possible .    as a first and most conservative approach , and",
    "in order to disentangle the gauss - bonnet effects from the pure scalar sector of the theory , we place ourselves in the einstein frame .",
    "since we assume the scalar field is driving an accelerated expansion , we also endow the field with a sufficiently flat potential in a cosmological background .    in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the class of theories we will be using , and give the cosmological field equations in suitable notation .",
    "we also derive the form of the theory when the scalar field is of kaluza - klein origin . in section  [ sec : gs ] , which is the backbone of this work , we write the cosmological perturbation equations .",
    "we then analyse the field equations for small gauss - bonnet coupling , and for a slowly rolling scalar field .",
    "present - day constraints are discussed in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we conclude and discuss our results in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "let us consider the following lagrangian @xmath4^{2}-2u(\\phi)+\\alpha{\\mathcal{l}}^{(c)}\\right)+{\\mathcal{l}}_{\\mathrm{mat}}\\label{eq : l}\\ ] ] where @xmath5^{2}\\nabla^{2}\\phi + \\xi_{4}(\\phi)[\\nabla\\phi]^{4 } \\label{melina}\\ ] ] @xmath6 @xmath7 is the einstein tensor and @xmath8 is the gauss - bonnet term .",

    "the form of the functions @xmath13 will be related to the origin of the scalar field .",
    "one possibility is the compactification of extra dimensions , as was mentioned in the introduction .",
    "consider the general @xmath2 dimensional lagrangian of pure gravity , @xmath14 which is of second order in the curvature operator to keep all generality  @xcite we would have to add higher - order curvature invariants . to understand their geometric origin",
    "see  @xcite . ] and yields second - order field equations , which are divergence free and have well defined and stable perturbations around the vacuum .",

    "the time variation of the gravitational coupling to the same order is then equal to @xmath117 in contrast to the small-@xmath9 limit , this time the @xmath53 perturbation does give significant contributions to @xmath80 and @xmath91 .",

    "comparing with the observational result is rather difficult here , because observational groups typically only quote their results in terms of the isw cross - correlation with large scale structure .",
    "hence knowledge would be required of the background dynamics , and of the full evolution of perturbations at all times , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "moreover the uncertainties in the data so far are so large , even for @xmath144cdm models , that a very detailed comparison looks premature .",
    "a rough limit on @xmath95 can be obtained taking the range of @xmath107 values that are consistent with isw measurements for a pure @xmath144cdm or for a constant-@xmath154 dark energy model . from  @xcite we can conservatively summarise the allowed range as @xmath155 .",
    "we then see from figure  [ iswfig ] that @xmath95 has to be in the interval @xmath156 in order not to produce too large or too small a isw cross - correlation .",
    "apparently the constraints from the isw effect are similar to those from the structure growth ; however , let us remark that this procedure assumes implicitly that in our coupled gb model the evolution of large scale structure is similar to standard dark energy models , which is clearly unwarranted .    combining the two constraints and assuming @xmath157 at the present",

    "we included all possible ghost - free second - order gravity terms in our model , since it is natural for them to all be present simultaneously .",
    "this can seen , for example , by considering a scalar field which arises from the compactification of an @xmath18-torus .",
    "the time variation of @xmath91 and the value of @xmath80 depend on the contribution of the higher - order gravity terms in the friedmann equation , i.e.  on the density fractions @xmath36 .",
    "this suggests that by taking them to be small , the constraints can be satisfied .",
    "if we take the coupling of the higher - order gravity terms ( @xmath9 ) to be small , this is indeed the case . on the other hand",
    "if we suppose that the variation of the scalar field is small ( which the @xmath36 are all proportional to ) , then we find that @xmath84 and @xmath160 can still be large .",
    "this is due to the fact that the higher - order gravity terms can still have a significant effect on perturbations to the scalar field , even when they have little effect on the friedmann equation .",
    "we considered the possibility of observing the coupled gb term through the matter perturbation growth and through the isw effect .",
    "we found that current data limit @xmath161 , assuming both small @xmath9 and slow rolling .",
    "this implies that the present effect of a coupled gb term is quite limited ; on the other hand , its impact during other epochs in cosmic history remains unbounded .",
    "the contributions from the higher - order `` @xmath148-essence '' scalar kinetic terms ( @xmath162 ) only affect @xmath80 and @xmath91 indirectly via the dynamics of the scalar field , and so the direct constraints on them are much weaker ( and completely absent in our slow - roll limit ) . however , unless the couplings @xmath163 are unnaturally large , the density fractions @xmath162 will be smaller than @xmath95 by factors of @xmath164 respectively , and thus completely negligible in a slowly rolling expansion .",
    "moreover , we have seen that the slow - roll condition is the less restrictive one , in the sense that any faster dynamics will in general yield ( barring chance cancellation ) tighter constraints on @xmath36 ( we have shown this explicitly only in the small-@xmath9 limit , but we can conjecture it is a general property , since higher - order terms in @xmath9 will generally also bring in higher - order terms in the time derivatives of @xmath21 ) . of course it is possible that the corrections to @xmath91 coming from the different modifications to gravity will cancel each other , resulting in far weaker constraints .",
    "this will generally require fine - tuning , although it could occur naturally as a result of symmetries in the underlying theory .    finally , we emphasise that the constraints obtained here are restricted to the einstein frame and to energy conservation . this hypothesis permitted us to disentangle any deviations from general relativity exclusively from the higher - order terms . relaxing this hypothesis , and also the determination of exact cosmological solutions ,",
    "are interesting subjects that we leave for future study .",
