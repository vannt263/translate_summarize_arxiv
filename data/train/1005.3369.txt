    "this is done by setting the position of the potential minima to @xmath9=80 nm and the initial value for the detuning parameter @xmath2=4.6 nm ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ potential ] ) , creating a ground state where both electrons are in the right dot ( see fig .",
    "[ dens1 ] ) .",
    "then , we lower the detuning in 5 ps to @xmath2=1.1 nm and simultaneously move the positions of the potential minima to @xmath9=40 nm ( solid line in fig .  [ potential ] ) . for these values ,",
    "the ground state of a single electron in the right dot is degenerate with the first excited state of a single electron in the left dot ( see fig .",
    "[ dens2 ] ) . hence ,",
    "charge oscillations between the two dots are now possible .",
    "if the detuning parameter is lowered to @xmath2=0 nm instead of 1.1 nm , the two - electron ground states become degenerate in both dots .",
    "this enables the oscillation of both electrons between the dots .",
    "we also simulate a scheme with oscillating detuning @xmath2=2.8",

    "we study the effect of detuning on the charge oscillations using several detuning values , illustrated in fig .",
    "we sweep the detuning from 4.6 nm to its final value in 5 ps , and after that keep the detuning constant in a zero magnetic field . for zero detuning , both electrons oscillate between the dots with period @xmath13 300 ps , as the ground states containing two electrons in one dot are degenerate .",
    "when the final detuning is changed to 0.35 nm , the charge dynamics changes completely , only a fraction of the charge goes to the other dot .",
    "this is due to the fact that now the two - electron ground states in the dots are not degenerate .",
    "when the final detuning is raised to 0.7 nm , more charge is moving to the other dot .",
    "when the final detuning is 1.1 nm , we have a situation where the first excited state of one electron in the first dot is degenerate with the ground state of two electrons in the second dot .",
    "now one electron oscillates between the dots with significantly faster oscillations than in the case of degenerate ground states in the dots , having a period @xmath11=20 ps . using this detuning , it is possible to induce faster charge dynamics .",
    "the switching speed of the detuning ( 5 ps ) is chosen so that the behavior of the charge dynamics is sufficiently smooth .",
    "if the switching is done in shorter time , the overall dynamics is similar , but shorter scale oscillations with a small amplitude emerge .",
    "this phenomenon is depicted in fig .",
    "[ qt ] , where we have calculated the dynamics corresponding to the uppermost curve in fig .",

    "next , we apply an oscillating detuning potential and also a non - zero magnetic field .",
    "the zeeman term in the hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) )",
    "is small compared to the exchange energy , and the electrons remain in the @xmath14 state .",
    "we use two different periods for the detuning voltage , namely @xmath11=33 ps ( fig .  [ q600 ] ) and @xmath11=66 ps ( fig .  [ q1200 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ q600 ] , one can see that for small magnetic fields there exists a slower oscillation in a 200 ps timescale , and a faster oscillation having the same period as the detuning voltage .",
    "when the magnetic field increases to 0.3 t , the one - electron states in the dots are not degenerate anymore .",
    "consequently , the charge oscillations have smaller amplitude . for a stronger magnetic field of 1 t",

    "[ q1200 ] , same parameters are used as in fig .",
    "[ q600 ] , only with the exception that the detuning oscillation period is now two times as long .",
    "the resulting charge oscillations are nonetheless quite different .",
    "the shorter scale oscillations have now a smaller amplitude , and the charge dynamics is now determined by the longer scale oscillations . for zero magnetic field , the charge stays mainly in the other dot .",
    "only momentarily there is a significant net charge in the other dot . for magnetic field value 0.03 t ,",
    "the oscillations are completely different . now the one - electron charge moves completely to the other dot and back , having a period around 800 ps .",
    "when the magnetic field values increase , the longer scale oscillations vanish as the system is not degenerate anymore .",
    "the shorter - scale oscillations dominate the dynamics , which becomes more chaotic with increasing magnetic field .",
    "we also studied other periods for the detuning , but for values that where not multiples of 33 ps in zero magnetic field , we did not observe any longer scale oscillation , and the charge dynamics was more chaotic .",
