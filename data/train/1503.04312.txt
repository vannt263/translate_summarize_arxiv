    "boron nitride is a popular substrate for high quality graphene devices because it is atomically smooth , has low chemical reactivity , and is typically relatively free of defects.@xcite these properties make it possible to achieve high graphene mobilities on hbn substrates .",
    "hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) is a wide band gap semiconductor@xcite with weakly coupled honeycomb lattice layers that are identical to graphene in structure , apart from a lattice constant difference of about two percent larger and possible differences in orientation . if the graphene and hbn lattices were perfectly matched , the graphene @xmath0 electrons would inherent hbn s broken inversion symmetry and develop a finite energy gap at neutrality.@xcite when exfoliated graphene is placed on a hbn surface , however , the two lattices do not align@xcite and the electronic structure is more complex.@xcite    in the most interesting case of nearly aligned layers , the two similar lattice periodicities lead to long - period moir patterns@xcite and to low - energy electronic properties that are insensitive to commensurability at an atomic level .",
    "experiments show that in samples of this type a gap nevertheless appears at the fermi level of a neutral sheet , and that its value is enhanced by electron - electron interactions and influenced by the strain patterns induced in the graphene sheet by the lattice constant mismatch.@xcite at zero rotation angle ( perfect alignment ) , the moir wavelength is around 15 nm . in this case ,",
    "secondary gapped dirac points appear@xcite at energies @xmath1 150 mev from the principal dirac point , corresponding to the fermi level of samples with @xmath2 electrons per moir period , corresponding to one full conduction band or one empty valance band , respectively .",
    "these electronic structure features are conveniently probed by studying the corresponding features in the carrier dependence of the _ dc _ transport properties of the graphene sheet . in this article , we present a theory of the transport properties of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride .",
    "we focus on the @xmath2 electron - per - period features associated with the secondary dirac points , and in particular on the substantial particle - hole asymmetry which appears in all electronic properties , including the density of states.@xcite we trace the asymmetry to the influence of the moir pattern on inter - sublattice hopping terms in the graphene sheet hamiltonian , and in particular to differences between the hopping amplitudes to nearest neighbor sites at carbon - above - boron and carbon - above - nitrogen positions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in section ii we briefly summarize the moir band hamiltonian we use as the basis for our transport theory . in section iii",
    "we describe its band structure and discuss its density - of - states , carefully analyzing the origin of its particle / hole asymmetry . in section",
    "iv we detail the transport theory we employ and in section v we summarize its predictions for graphene on hbn .",
    "finally , in section vi we discuss and summarize our findings .",
    "the moir band hamiltonian we employ for the graphene sheet @xmath0-band electrons accounts for the influence of the substrate by adding a local sub - lattice dependent term to the @xmath3 dirac model of an isolated graphene sheet .",
    "the substrate interaction term has the same periodicity as the moir pattern and , because it is periodic , can be analyzed using bloch s theorem .",
    "the moir band hamiltonian yields a non - trivial band structure .",
    "it does not account for those features of the full hamiltonian associated with atomic - scale commensurability and is accurate only for moir pattern periods that greatly exceed the graphene sheet lattice constant .",
    "this however is the interesting case , because the influence of the substrate is weak for short moir periods .",
    "the latter property can be traced@xcite in part to the property that the distance between layers is substantially larger than the distance between atoms within a layer .    at a given position in the moir pattern , the substrate interaction term in the moir band hamiltonian reflects the local coordination between the graphene sheet and the substrate lattice , _ i.e. _ the positions of nearby boron and nitrogen atoms in the substrate relative to the positions of the carbon atoms in the graphene sheet .",
    "the substrate interaction term can be evaluated using _ ab initio _",
    "methods@xcite by calculating the rigid displacement dependence of the band hamiltonian of commensurate honeycomb structures .",
    "in this paper we use a moir band hamiltonian for graphene on hbn derived in this way .",
    "the moir band hamiltonian is able to account for the lattice mismatch of around 1.7 percent between graphene and hbn , and for strains in the graphene lattice and the substrate , and can be applied at any relative orientation between graphene sheet and substrate .",
    "@xcite in a previous work we explained in detail how these effects combine with electron - electron interactions to control the size of the the gap which opens at the fermi level of neutral graphene sheets , _",
    "i.e. _ at the primary dirac points in momentum space.@xcite in this paper we will focus on the secondary dirac points , and on gaps at the fermi level of graphene sheets with @xmath2 electrons per moir period .",
    "these features reflect the scattering of bare graphene sheet electrons off the periodic part of the substrate interaction hamiltonian , whereas the neutral sheet gaps reflect mainly the spatial average of the substrate interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the moir band hamiltonian can be written as a sum of bare dirac ( @xmath4 ) and substrate interaction ( @xmath5 ) contributions : @xmath6 for practical calculations , we express this hamiltonian operator as a matrix in momentum space : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are sublattice indices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are wavevectors , @xmath12 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 over one period of the moir pattern , and @xmath14 is a moir pattern reciprocal lattice vector",
    "discusses three versions of the moir band hamiltonian @xmath15 . in the first version",
    "neither graphene nor boron nitride atomic positions were allowed to relax under the the influences of inter - layer forces .",
    "this version gives very small band gaps at the primary dirac point and is not consistent with experimental results .",
    "the other choices are to let just the graphene lattice relax , or to let both the graphene and boron nitride lattices relax .",
    "these lead to larger primary dirac point gaps that are more in line with experimentally observed results , suggesting that strains play an essential role in samples with large period moir patterns . in this paper",
    "we will use the version of the moir band hamiltonian that accounts for strains in both graphene and in the substrate , although we expect only relatively small quantitative substrate strain effects at the secondary dirac points .",

    "( c ) the density of states ( horizontal axis ) as a function of energy ( vertical axis ) . ]    .",
    "the substrate interaction hamiltonian lifts these degeneracies .",
    "there are 2-band avoided crossing near the m point ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) and three band avoid crossings near the k point ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) in both the conduction band and the valence band . ]    the moir band structure and the density - of - states for the case of zero twist angle between graphene and substrate hexagonal lattices and a lattice constant mismatch of @xmath16 are illustrated in figure [ fig : bandstructure ] .",
    "note that in addition to the small gap at the dirac point , there are avoided crossings at the high - symmetry brillouin - zone boundary points m and k. the electronic structure in this region of energy is highlighted in the figure [ fig : bandstructurezoom ] . because distinct points on the brillouin - zone boundary are connected by reciprocal lattice vectors , the size of the avoided crossing gaps is directly related to elastic scattering of bare graphene states off the substrate interaction hamiltonian associated with the moir pattern .",
    "there is a distinct particle - hole asymmetry between the conduction and valence bands which is apparent in the density - of - states ( figure [ fig : bandstructure ] ( c ) ) and has been discussed previously in refs .  ,",
    "in terms of a phenomenological substrate interaction hamiltonian in which the number of free parameters has been minimized using symmetry considerations ( the phenomenological substrate interaction hamiltonian is compared with the interaction hamiltonian derived from _ ab initio _",
    "theory used here in appendix a ) and in ref .   in terms of an effective hamiltonian derived from a tight binding model .    to understand the physical mechanism behind this asymmetry",
    ", we use a nearly - free dirac - electron approximation by treating the substrate - interaction hamiltonian as a perturbation at the m point . when reduced to the brillouin - zone ,",
    "two eigenstates of the bare graphene dirac hamiltonian , corresponding to dirac cones centered at @xmath17 and @xmath18 are degenerate at the m point . here",
    "@xmath19 is the magnitude of the primitive moir reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the perturbed energies are , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the band index ( @xmath22 for conduction band and @xmath23 for valence band ) , @xmath24 is the energy of the bare dirac hamiltonian states at the m point , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the wavevector - dependent sub lattice spinor of the unperturbed dirac hamiltonian .",
    "this leading order perturbation theory analysis implies a band - dependent energy splitting at the m point equal to @xmath27 .    to extract the physics behind the strong band dependence of this splitting , apparent in figure [ fig : bandstructurezoom ] and indirectly in figure [ fig : bandstructure ]",
    ", we decompose each fourier component of the moir band hamiltonian into terms proportional to different sub lattice pauli matrix contributions:@xcite @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the 2x2 identity matrix ) .",
    "note that the expansion into pauli matrices is justified by the property that @xmath13 is hermitian ; the non - hermitian character of @xmath12 allows the expansion coefficients @xmath30 to be complex .",
    "for the @xmath31-direction m - point , the bare sub lattice spinor has a pseudospin orientation proportional to the @xmath31-direction momentum .",
    "it follows that , @xmath32 and therefore that the coupling matrix element @xmath33 is produced by the @xmath34 inter sub lattice tunneling and the @xmath35 sub lattice site - energy contributions to the substrate interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the two sign choices in eq .",
    "[ eqn : mtaux ] correspond to conduction and valence bands . from the substrate interaction",
    "hamiltonian @xmath36 it follows that the two contributions to @xmath33 add in the valence band case and nearly cancel in the conduction band case .",
    "the final result is that the gap at the m point in the moir brillouin - zone is @xmath37  mev in the valence band and almost an order of magnitude larger than in the conduction band where @xmath38  mev .",
    "real space maps of the coefficients of the pauli matrix expansion of the sub - lattice dependent substrate interaction hamiltonian , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , are provided in figure [ fig : hrealmaps ] . in our calculations the spatial origin is chosen to lie at an aa point in figure  [ fig : bandstructure ] .",
    "the relevant fourier component for the matrix element we evaluate is @xmath42 .",
    "the weighting factor in @xmath43 is therefore complex conjugated when @xmath44 in figure  [ fig : hrealmaps ] where we see that @xmath45 is approximately even and @xmath46 is approximately odd .",
    "@xmath47 provides a measure of the difference between site energies on the two graphene sub lattices .",
    "the difference between @xmath0-orbital energies is largest in magnitude when one carbon site is above the positively charged nitrogen site and the other is above the negatively charged boron site . at ba sites the carbon atoms above boron have a higher site energy than the the hexagonal plaquette centered carbon atoms , whereas at ab sites the plaquette centered carbon atoms have a higher site energy than the carbon atoms above nitrogen .",
    "it follows that the on - site term @xmath45 is negative at aa positions and positive at both ab and ba positions .",
    "the pseudospin term @xmath48 provides a measure of differences between the hopping amplitudes from a carbon atom to its three near neighbors , and this difference vanishes by symmetry at @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 sites .",
    "carbon - carbon hopping is most anisotropic when one carbon atom is above the mid - point of a bn bond , and this leads to @xmath48 values which have opposite sign at the mid - point between @xmath49 and @xmath50 points compared to the mid - point between @xmath49 and @xmath51 points , and therefore to @xmath52 values that are approximately imaginary .",
    "we see therefore that the particle hole asymmetry is described correctly only when both site energy and hopping amplitude distortions are accounted for properly .        at the @xmath31-direction k point , there are three approximately degenerate bands , corresponding to @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "perturbation theory ( appendix  [ sec : kperturbation ] ) at k leads to a result that is similar to perturbation theory at m in that band separations are larger for the valence band than for the conduction band .",
    "although the nearly - free - electron calculation is not as simple as in the two bands case , it is again true that a correct understanding of the origin of the strong particle - hole asymmetry requires an accurate account of substrate induced changes in both @xmath0-band energies and @xmath0-band hopping amplitudes .",
    "with this background established , we now explore the _ dc _ transport properties of graphene on boron nitride .",
    "one possible approach is to apply boltzmann transport theory to the bands predicted by the moir band hamiltonian .",
    "this strategy is however reliable only when the associated bloch state energy uncertainty , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the bloch state lifetime , is small compared to the energy scale of band structure features . because of the long period of the moir pattern and the relatively weak strength of the substrate interaction , the largest band structure feature scale is the @xmath58 mev valence band gap at four holes per moir period explained in the previous section .",
    "we therefore choose an approach that is able to describe both weak and strong substrate interaction limits by applying a kinetic equation which is able to account for both intraband and interband contributions to the conductivity and using a relaxation time approximation for disorder .",
    "an overview of the theory is presented in this section , with details in appendix  [ sec : transporttheory ] .",
    "the conductivity can be decomposed into intraband and interband terms , arising from scattering within a single band and scattering between bands .",
    "the intraband contribution is proportional to the density of states and the interband contributions become important when the spacings between bands close to the fermi energy is smaller than @xmath59 . in particular , because of the small band separations at the brillouin zone boundary , we anticipate a large interband contribution to the conductivity at four electrons per moir period .",
    "we obtain an estimate for the steady state density matrix by combining the equation of motion for the density - matrix ( @xmath60 ) with a relaxation time approximation that accounts for the influence of disorder scattering on both band diagonal and band off - diagonal terms : @xmath61}+\\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial{{\\bf k}}}\\cdot e{{\\bf e}}-\\frac{\\rho-\\rho_{0}}{\\tau}\\ ] ] here , @xmath62 is the moir band hamiltonian in equation  , @xmath63 is the magnitude of electric charge , @xmath64 is the applied electric field , @xmath10 is wave - vector in the moir brillouin zone measured from one of the graphene valleys , and @xmath57 is the relaxation time .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side is purely off - diagonal in a moir band bloch representation and vanishes in equilibrium .",
    "the second term on the right - hand - side is the forcing term due to electric field , and the last term is the relaxation time approximation for scattering .",
    "we treat the relaxation time as an adjustable independent parameter , and assume that @xmath57 is the same for both intraband and interband scattering . in the steady state , @xmath65 .",
    "we expand this equation to linear order in the electric field @xmath64 , writing the density matrix , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the linear response correction to the equilibrium moir band density - matrix @xmath68 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a band index , and @xmath71 is one if the state is filled and zero if the state is empty .",
    "since the first and third terms on the right - hand - side of equation   are proportional to @xmath67 , the kinetic equation is readily solved for the density - matrix linear response . the linear response current , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the direction , @xmath74 is the current operator and @xmath75 is the dirac velocity of graphene .",
    "note that @xmath57 without a superscript refers to relaxation time , while @xmath76 with a superscript is a pauli matrix .",
    "the conductivity can be correspondingly written as a sum of an intraband contribution due the dependence in eq .",

    "is motivated by the experimental finding that the conductivity in graphene sheets is proportional to carrier density - i.e. that although the mobility can be sample dependent , it is approximately independent of density in individual samples .",
    "this property of graphene is related to the dependence of the disorder scattering amplitude on momentum transfer.@xcite we calculate the band velocity by taking the average of the velocity along the direction from the moir zone center to the zone corner ( @xmath84 to k in fig .  [",
    "fig : bandstructure](a ) ) , and the velocity along the direction from the zone center to the zone edge ( @xmath84 to m in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure](a ) ) .",
    "we note that this procedure introduces a spurious reduction in the band velocity for the higher energy band of around 10 percent .",
    "while both this velocity averaging and the isotropic assumption for @xmath57 are rough estimates , we expect this approximation will capture the main features of the electron transport .",

    "note that according to our calculations there is a finite energy gap in the valence band which is indirect in moir momentum space and therefore smaller than the local valence band gaps at individual momenta .",
