    "planetary nebulae have long been thought of as ionized remnants of circumstellar material ejected by stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . that somewhat limited view has changed dramatically , as the neutral component of the remnant circumstellar envelope has been shown to remain observable very late into the lifetime of many planetary nebulae ( pne ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "it is now known that many pne are characterized by emission from material that is contained in rapidly evolving photodissocation regions ( pdrs ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as the central star and nebula evolve ,",
    "uv emission from the star increases rapidly . a photodissociation front moves through the gas and slowly turns the mostly molecular nebula to predominantly atomic .",
    "at this point , the nebula radiates mainly in the infrared .",
    "when the central star becomes hotter than @xmath8 k , the circumstellar gas quickly becomes ionized and the planetary nebula shines brightly in visible light .",
    "the chemical properties of gas in pne and proto - pne ( ppn ) are like those of interstellar pdrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are well modeled ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the time over which molecular material can be present in pne is typically predicted to be a rather brief period in the lifetime of pne ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "but , such timescales predicted from current chemical models are limited by observational data and lack of a clear understanding of the morphology and density structure of these objects .",
    "7027 is perhaps the best studied planetary nebula , in part because of its proximity ( about 900 pc ; e.g. @xcite ) and high surface brightness at all wavelengths .",
    "it has a very rich atomic and molecular spectrum , making it ripe for study at all wavelengths , and it is rich in physical and chemical information ( see , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) . because of its compact size as viewed from earth ( @xmath9 ) , the morphology , particularly that for the 2  emission , of this object has been suggested , but has not been clearly revealed ( see , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the elliptical ionized core lies at the center of an extended molecular envelope ( @xcite ) . at the interface between the cold molecular envelope and the hot ionized region",
    "is an apparent `` quadrupolar '' region of strong near  infrared ( ir ) rotational - vibrational molecular hydrogen emission ( @xcite ) that has been shown to be excited by absorption of uv photons in the photodissociation region ( @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed understanding of the morphology of planetary nebulae is important .",
    "it has been demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between the presence of molecular emission from pne and the observed morphology of the pne , such that objects that contain large amounts of molecular material are bipolar or butterfly nebulae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "progenitor mass also correlates with morphological type , such that higher mass stars appear to produce bipolar or butterfly nebulae ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation suggests that the higher mass agb progenitors , which probably have the highest mass loss rates , produce dense , long lived molecular envelopes ( @xcite ) .    the evolution of pdr and pne , and the correlation between morphology with molecular content are not fully understood . because ngc 7027 is in a rapid and key moment in evolution ( the transition from neutral , predominantly molecular envelope to an ionized one )",
    ", it is worthy of serious study into its chemical and physical properties and its detailed morphology .",
    "the hubble space telescope and nicmos provided the high spatial resolution , dynamic range , and stable background needed to examine the near - ir nature of ngc 7027 . in this paper , we present narrowband images in the 1 ( @xmath10 ) line of molecular hydrogen and other filters that trace the ionized core and the nearby neutral region .",
    "these images show with unprecedented clarity the true structure of ngc 7027 . in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "we discuss the data , the apparent morphology , and the presence of a jet ( or jets ) in the object . in ",
    "4 we present a 3-dimensional model for the overall structure , including the photodissociation region .",
    "section 5 presents a discussion of the excitation of the nebula and the central star properties .",
    "we then consider our results in light of previous work , and discuss the evolution of the pdr in ngc 7027 .",
    "we have imaged 7027 with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the near - infrared camera multiobject spectrometer ( nicmos ) at 7 near - infrared wavelengths between 1.1  and 2.15 ( figs .  1 and 2 )",
    ". the 1.10  broadband ( f110w ) observations were made with camera 1 ( pixel scale = 0.043  pixel@xmath11 , field of view or fov = 11@xmath311 ) .",
    "all of the other observations were made with camera 2 ( pixel scale = 0.075pixel@xmath11 , fov = 19.2@xmath319.2 ) .",
    "the observations were made in one of the multiaccum detector readout modes ( usually multiaccum 256 ; see the nicmos instrument handbook ) to obtain a very high dynamic range .",
    "a variety of dither patterns were utilized to sample the array uniformly ; in the case of the f110w observations dithering / mosaicing was required to obtain a complete image of the source .",
    "chop ( or blank sky ) frames for background subtraction were also obtained for all filters except f110w and f160w ( 1.60 broadband ) . from ground - based observations it was known that the full extent of the 2  emission in 7027 is slightly larger than the nicmos camera 2 field of view .",
    "a specific orientation of the observatory was used to put the largest known extent of the emission along a diagonal of the array .",
    "dither patterns were used that would ensure complete coverage of the emission .",
    "the method worked very well , and no emission was missed , although it does appear that very low level scattered light does extend off the array in some of the bands observed .",
    "a summary of the observations is presented in table [ tblsumobs ] , and the data are presented in figs . 1 and 2 .    the data were originally reduced and calibrated by the standard space telescope science institute ( stsci ) nicmos pipeline , but we subsequently re - reduced all of the data using better characterized calibration files ( flat - fields , dark frames , and bad pixel masks ) as well as a revised version of the stsdas calibration task calnica . after reduction of individual frames , the multiple images at each wavelength were mosaiced together using the stsdas calnicb task in iraf .",
    "the reduced images were flux calibrated using nicmos photometric calibration tables provided by m. rieke ( private communication ) .",
    "the hst wide field / planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) data were acquired from the stsci hst data archive .    [ [ isolating - the - h_2-emission ] ] isolating the h@xmath5 emission ",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    an examination of the near - ir spectrum of ngc 7027 ( @xcite ) , and the f212n and f215n filter transmission curves shows that both filters suffer from line contamination .",
    "in addition to the 2 1 line at 2.121 , the f212n filter also transmits the 2.113 line at @xmath2 83% of peak transmission .",
    "the f215n filter , used for sampling continuum emission adjacent to the 2line , includes within the filter bandpass the  line at 2.167  at @xmath12 2  4% transmission .",
    "we made use of all available data , theoretical modeling , and empirical fitting to provide the cleanest possible subtraction of the continuum and contaminating lines in the 2  image .",
    "a simple subtraction of the flux calibrated continuum image from the line image not only isolates the 2 emission but also shows a dark ( negative ) inner ring - shaped region that resembles the ionized nebula ; this inner region is an artifact of over  subtraction of the line contribution from the 2  filter data .",
    "typically , a bright ring of emission is seen in ground  based narrowband 2  images of ngc 7027 ( see , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , because the continuum filters most often used do not include emission in the bandpass .",
    "since uncertainties associated with filter transmission are largest along the edges of the bandpass ( where transmission changes rapidly with wavelength ) , we first made an estimate of the transmission . using the f190n image as `` true '' continuum for the f215n image , we compared the observed  flux with that obtained by @xcite using ground  based spectroscopy .",
    "we measured our fluxes at both of the spatial locations at which their slits were placed ( labelled n and nw in their paper ) and found that we detect approximately 7  8% of their  fluxes at each point . since the  to ratio is @xmath2 15 ( @xcite ) and assuming that the line is transmitted at 83% of peak , this implies that we need to scale the f215n image by @xmath2 0.8 to cancel out the emission in the ( f212n  f215n ) difference image .",
    "this process of eliminating line contamination assumes that the the to  ratio is fairly constant over the nebula .",
    "photoionization modeling using cloudy ( @xcite ) shows that s@xmath13/s@xmath14 ratio does not change by more than 20% over the region 1.5@xmath310@xmath15 cm to the outer edge , 3@xmath310@xmath15 cm ( @xmath12 10 20 ) .",
    "thus , we can scale the  emission ( the f215n image ) to cancel out the emission in f212n  f215n difference image to a very high degree . given the uncertainties involved in this procedure , we used scale factors in the range 0.7  1 to determine the best 2difference image empirically .",
    "we found that a value of 0.9 , when applied to the f215n image , provided the cleanest subtraction of the continuum and from the f212n image .",
    "this scaling factor is consistent with @xmath2 6%  transmission in the f215n filter .",
    "this procedure has resulted in the nearly pure molecular hydrogen emission image of ngc 7027 shown in figure 3 .",
    "the continuum subtracted 2 image has an integrated line brightness of 3.8@xmath310@xmath16 erg s@xmath11 @xmath17 and an average surface brightness of 8@xmath310@xmath18 erg s@xmath11 @xmath17 ster@xmath11 .",
    "using a similar process of aligning images before subtraction we find an integrated  line flux ( the f187n line filter and f190n continuum filter ; see fig .  1 ) of @xmath1910@xmath20 ( fig .  1 )",
    "most of the images ( narrow- and broad - band ) are remarkably similar ( see figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the emission is dominated by a bright , patchy elliptical ring ( major axis along pa = 150 ) which is the ionized nebula ; the overall shape and extent of this nebula is similar to that previously observed in visible light , near - ir , and radio continuum images ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the visible light images of hst / wfpc2 that show a `` filled - in '' ellipsoid , the near - ir morphology ( where optical depths are lower ) clearly shows an ellipsoidal shell .",
    "the high spatial resolution of these new hst / nicmos images clearly resolves the ellipsoidal shell into apparent clumps ( or `` clump - like '' variations in brightness ) , regions of varying surface brightness , and dark dust lanes .",
    "the brightest region appears to be a clump located about 4  nw of the center of the nebula ( marked by the location of the visible central star ) .",
    "the central star stands out clearly in the continuum images .",
    "the similarity between the  and continuum images suggest that the broad - band filters trace free - free or free - bound emission from hot gas , rather than dust - scattered starlight , which is apparent as extended emission in the wfpc2 data .",
    "the f212n filter clearly shows a second , spatially distinct component that is not seen in the other filters : wisps of ro - vibrationally excited 2  emission that appears to surround the ionized nebula .",
    "furthermore , there is also clear evidence of a disruption of the gas along a nw - se ( pa @xmath2 130  measured e of n ) axis ; this might be caused by wind interactions with an off - axis bipolar jet ( see  [ jet ] ) .",
    "the continuum  subtracted 2 image ( fig .",
    "[ h2only ] ) clearly shows two bright intersecting rings , which we interpret as brightened rims of an inclined biconical structure (  [ h2model ] ) .",
    "this structure encloses the roughly elliptical ionized region .",
    "the structures seen in molecular hydrogen emission and in tracers of the ionized core appear different and spatially distinct .      the 2  emission ( figs .  1",
    " 3 ) shows bubble - like extensions at the outer edge of the bulk emission region .",
    "this apparent disturbance falls along an axis @xmath12 20 40  ( pa = 130  nw to se ) to the west of the polar axis , extending through the central star to the opposite side of the nebula ( pa = 130nw to se ) .",
    "there are hints of these structures in ground - based near  ir data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as well as in radio continuum images of the ionized region ( @xcite ) .",
    "because of the clarity of these new data , we can now suggest a cause for this structure .",
    "the wisps of 2  emission revealed clearly in these hst data indicate that this region has been disturbed by something other than dust  photon interactions or a uniform , radially directed , outflowing wind .",
    "we suggest that there is present in 7027  a highly collimated , `` off - axis '' jet .",
    "the disturbance is not only seen in the molecular region , but is clearly evident in the ionized core along precisely the same position angle .",
    "the structure extends into the region of scattered emission seen in the wfpc2 images as well ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the sharpness of the extended wfpc2 emission argues against something like turbulent instabilities .",
    "there is no kinematical evidence for the jet , nor is there any extended collimated emission in the hst images ; this leads us to believe that the jet may have disrupted the nebula in the past and has now died down . at a much lower level , there appears to be similar evidence for another jet , or the same jet precessing , at a polar angle of @xmath12 10  to the east of the north pole .",
    "along an axis in this direction there is an additional region of `` disturbed '' 2  emission most clearly seen on the southern side of the nebula .",
    "the ionized core has apparent breaks or disruptions along this axis on the northern side , and extensions can be seen in the wfpc2 data as well ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the locations of these features are indicated by lines 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "we speculate that the disturbed morphology of ngc 7027 might be a result of one or more brets ( bipolar rotating episodic jets ; @xcite ) . in this",
    "regard we note that the two axes that we have identified simply show the most pronounced structure ; however much of the other billowy structure and wisps ( especially prominent in the h@xmath5 data ) is likely caused by the same , or similar processes . evidence for precessing , collimated jets that are on , or away from the primary pn axis are also seen in a number of other pne .",
    "the most striking example might be ngc 6543 ( the `` cat s eye nebula ; '' @xcite ) .",
    "7027 appears to be in a very early stage of forming a jet , or perhaps the jet is a transient phenomenon .",
    "the fact that we do not see the jet itself suggests that either we have not found the right diagnostic line or wavelength to probe the jet kinematically , or the jet has now shut off .",
    "we have modeled the spatial and kinematical structure of 7027 using a geometrical modeling code described by dayal ( 1999 ) .",
    "the code uses cartesian coordinates ( for adaptability to different geometries ) , and the nebula is divided into 10@xmath21 0075-sized cells . in these models",
    "the nebula is assumed to have azimuthal symmetry with the star at the center .",
    "once the shape and dimensions of a source have been set , the density , temperature , or velocity fields can be specified independently as functions of the radial distance from the center and/or latitude .",
    "the expansion of the nebula is assumed to be purely radial , directed away from the central star .",
    "the tilt angle of the nebula ( w.r.t .",
    "the plane of the sky ) can be varied independently for each model .",
    "assuming that the emission is optically thin , the code numerically integrates the emission per cell along each line of sight , to produce surface brightness and position  velocity ( p  v ) maps . the surface ",
    "brightness maps are convolved with a gaussian beam ( fwhm = 025 ) to match the instrumental point spread function .",
    "the source function , which determines the emission in each cell , can be specified as a function of the local temperature and/or density depending on the emission mechanism that is being modeled ( recombination line emission , dust thermal emission , dust scattering etc . ) .",
    "the physical parameters for the nebular model are well constrained by the high spatial resolution afforded by hst and nicmos . ground",
    " based kinematical data that have been obtained with cshell at the irtf provide radial velocity information , which imposes even stronger constraints on the nebula s 3-d structure ; these data also provide valuable information on the dynamics and evolutionary timescales of the nebula .",
    "a full presentation of these data will be made elsewhere ( @xcite ) note that changing the model geometry changes the shape of the image and the p - v diagram ; changing the density law changes the relative location and contrast of bright and dark regions in the image and the p - v diagram , but not the shape / size of the image ; finally changing the velocity law does not affect the image but changes the shape of the p - v diagram . therefore , model images together and p - v diagrams , impose strong constraints , allowing us to develop fairly robust models for the spatial and kinematical structure of the source .",
    "we focus here on reconstructing the 3-dimensional structure of the excited h@xmath5 shell , which represents the pdr .",
    "however we also construct a model of the  emission and compare the density and velocity structure of ionized gas that we derive , with  and radio recombination lines respectively , and estimate a total mass for the ionized gas .",
    "finally , we also construct a spherical , isotropically scattering dust model and compare those results with a wfpc2 continuum image .",
    "note that each of the 3 components is modeled separately , using independent constraints provided by different images .",
    "we adopt source functions and emission coefficients appropriate for the nebular temperature and density , for each of the three components .",
    "the 2  emission is modeled as a `` capped '' bi - conical ( hourglass - shaped ) structure which shares the same axis , but lies exterior to the ionized nebula ( fig .",
    "[ modelschem ] ) .",
    "the outer dimensions of the bi - cone are well constrained by the continuum subtracted 2  image ( fig .",
    "[ h2only ] ) : the intersecting outer rings represent the maximum diameter of the cone ; the major axis to minor axis ratio constrains the tilt of the cone to be @xmath22 45@xmath235  ( w.r.t .",
    "the plane of the sky ) . based on an established tilt and a maximum cone diameter",
    ", the observed separation between the large rings determines the height of the cone .",
    "the radius of the waist of the hourglass is harder to constrain from the data due to projection effects .",
    "we simply assume that this dimension matches the minor axis of the ionized gas ellipsoid (  4.2 ) , r@xmath24 = 28 , though in reality , the neutral gas probably lies somewhat outside the ionized gas .",
    "the waist diameter along with the maximum diameter of the cone allows us to estimate an opening angle for the cone .",
    "there is some evidence in the images that the h@xmath5 emission is not confined to a conical shell that is open at the poles , but extends all around the ionized gas ellipsoid .",
    "wisps of 2 emission are seen superposed on the northern and south - eastern parts of the ionized nebula in fig .",
    "2 . also , our model images show that an `` open '' cone can not produce the bright rims , along the top and bottom of the structure , as are seen in the images . when a `` cap '' of similar thickness as the walls of the bicone is added , limb brightening along lines of sight through the caps",
    "alleviates this problem ( see figs .",
    "5(a),(b ) ) . by comparing intensity cuts across the model with similar cuts across the image",
    "we more accurately determine the dimensions of the h@xmath5 shell .",
    "the walls of the bicone are constrained by the thickness of the observed h@xmath5 rims , @xmath1r @xmath2 05@xmath2301 ( 6@xmath25 cm at the adopted distance of 0.88 kpc ) .",
    "for example , increasing the width of the shell reduces the gap between the rims of the h@xmath5 bicone and the inner , ionized gas ellipsoid ; decreasing the width of the shell produces narrower looking rims than are seen in the nicmos - only color composite image ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . because the nebula is inclined to the line of sight , it is difficult to ascertain variations in the thickness of the h@xmath5 shell as a function of latitude ( particularly at low latitudes ) .",
    "we assume therefore that the shell has a constant width .",
    "[ [ limitations ] ] limitations  + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the cone / cap model here is an approximation to the nebula , which probably has a smoother , bi  lobed shape .",
    "however , building up the model in separate components allows us to see the effects of the cap ( or lack thereof ) on the p - v diagram and images . though we do not believe that a smoother hourglass figure model would yield significantly different results",
    ", it may match the brightness in the interior ( equatorial regions ) of the h@xmath5 images somewhat better than our current models , which appear to overestimate the h@xmath5 brightness in this region .",
    "long - slit cshell spectra of the 2  1 line are invaluable in constraining the geometry of the source more tightly .",
    "the p - v diagram obtained by placing the slit along the major axis of the source is shown in fig .",
    "[ posveldig ] .",
    "the emission region has an elongated elliptical shape suggesting that there are distinct red and blue  shifted components of emission both in the top and bottom halves of the nebula .",
    "the shape of the p - v diagram confirms that the nebula is oriented such that the n - e part of the shell is tilted _ towards _ the observer and the s - w part is tilted _ away _ from the observer .",
    "this orientation is consistent with that of the ionized gas ellipsoid observed by @xcite , who used an echelle spectrograph with a velocity resolution of 6 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the four bright `` spots '' of emission , located symmetrically about the center of the nebula , indicate locally bright regions along the slit separated in velocity .",
    "the two bright regions closer to the center mark the position of the limb  brightened inner rims of the bicone on the slit , while the bright regions at the top and bottom correspond to the limb - brightened `` caps '' of the bicone , which lie almost in the plane of the sky .",
    "it is the position - velocity diagram that uniquely constrains the distribution of h@xmath5 along the poles .",
    "figs . 5 ( c ) and ( d ) show model p - v diagrams obtained with and without a cap .",
    "clearly a conical structure _ with _ the spherical cap gives a more complete fit to the observed p - v diagram than one without the cap .",
    "a constant expansion velocity of 20 km s@xmath11 is able to reproduce the observed spectra quite well though we can not rule out deviations from this law on smaller spatial scales .",
    "[ posveldig ] ( b ) , ( c ) show how the shape of the model p - v diagram changes with the velocity law . in general , a larger velocity law exponent results in a larger  kink \" in the position velocity diagram , corresponding to more abrupt change in the projected velocity from the rim of the cone ( large r ) to the interior of the cone .",
    "a comparison with the data allows us to rule out a velocity exponent , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , for our adopted model geometry we can rule out a constant dynamical timescale for all points in the 2  shell , as one might expect for an aspherical shell expanding in a self - similar way .",
    "the velocity law implies that at a latitude of 25  the walls have a dynamical timescale of 950 yr and further out , at 36  ( where the bicone ends and the spherical cap begins ) the timescale is @xmath2 1,300 yr .",
    "we note that since this is an expanding photodissociation front , the dynamical timescale is not the most appropriate one for characterizing the evolution ( see  6.2 ) .",
    "though the excitation of h@xmath5 is primarily via absorption of uv photons ( i.e. non - thermal , see  5.2 ) we assume here that the 2 is thermally excited and that the level populations are described by a vibrational excitation temperature in the range @xmath27 k ( see @xcite ) . later in this paper we show that this assumption gives reasonable results when compared to more detailed models of dense pdrs . if the h@xmath5 emission is optically thin , then the model intensity at each pixel is simply proportional to the density of h@xmath5 molecules integrated along a given line of sight : @xmath28 where the emission coefficient ( in erg s@xmath11 @xmath17 per molecule ) is @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the spatial increment along the line of sight . the spontaneous radiative decay coefficient for the 10 s(1 ) line , @xmath31 = 3.47@xmath310@xmath32 s@xmath11 ( @xcite ) , the nuclear spin statistical weight g@xmath33 = 3 ( ortho - h@xmath5 ) and j=3 . the energy of the upper level of the transition , e@xmath34 = 6947 k. using the polynomial coefficients for the partition function , @xmath35 , given in @xcite we calculate the change in the product , @xmath36 @xmath37 q(t ) e@xmath38 with temperature in the range 2000 k @xmath39 t @xmath39 11,000 k. we find that @xmath36 changes by about a factor of 1.5 over the range 6,000 @xmath39 t @xmath39 9,000 k. we simply assume @xmath36 = 220 , and use this in the the above equation .    using the equation above to fit the observed integrated intensity of h@xmath5 ( 3.8@xmath310@xmath16 erg s@xmath11 @xmath17 ;  3.1.1 ) and the h@xmath5 radial brightness profile ( fig .",

    "graham ( 1993a ) argued , primarily from morphology , that the near - ir 2  emission from 7027  is caused by fuv excitation in the pdr .",

    "there is no evidence of shock excitation , though localized shocked regions can not be ruled out .    in a pdr",
    "the 2  emission is observed in a thin transition region where the 2  column density of fuv excited molecules peaks .",
    "interior to the transition region the molecules have mostly been dissociated . because the excitation process is by absorption of line photons , the depth of excitation is strongly limited by self - shielding of the molecules to lyman and werner band line radiation .",

    "the models are also consistent with a thin transition ( 2  emitting ) region like that found from the 3-d models discussed in  4",
    ". the nonuniformity and patchiness of the transition region must be a result of structure in the circumstellar material itself .",
    "instabilities of the type required are not understood in an interacting wind , photon - dominated environment .",
    "the `` waves '' present on the illuminated interior of the 2  emission region resemble those seen in the hst / wfpc2 images of mycn 18 ( the `` etched hourglass nebula ; '' @xcite ; @xcite ) , and although are seen in very different components of the gas ( ionized versus molecular ) most likely are a result of a similar instability .",
    "it is important to consider whether the overall shape of the pdr ( as it extends from the ionized core to the biconical , or bubble shaped 2  emission ) as found from our hst / nicmos images is consistent with what is expected for an evolving pdr in a distribution of material likely to be present in a post - agb circumstellar envelope .",
    "first , we must determine what is a likely distribution of circumstellar material .",
    "it has been known for some time that post - agb objects and pne generally do not have a spherical ( radially symmetric ) distribution of gas and dust .",
    "the most extreme examples include afgl 2688 ( the `` egg nebula '' ) , afgl 618 , m 2 - 9 , and m 1 - 16 ( to list just a few ; see , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these objects have a predominantly axially symmetric distribution of circumstellar material such that the density is greatest at the equator and lowest near the two poles .",
    "with support from general morphological studies , hydrodynamic modeling , and polarimetric observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) this type of distribution ( to a widely varying degree ) appears to be generally true for most , or all post - agb objects .",
    "7027  is not an `` extreme '' bipolar nebula ( of the type listed above ) , but we can assume that the equatorial to polar density contrast as the star evolved off the agb has a functional form that goes roughly like @xmath91 with additional factors of order unity .",
    "functions like this have been used to model the scattered light and molecular distribution from a number of bipolar ppne and pne ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in an environment with a single , central fuv source and with a constant gas to dust ratio , the dominant parameters that will determine the radial structure of the pdr are the density structure , @xmath92 and the distance to the central source . for guidance some new computations were made using a code developed for a related purpose , and this topic will be explored quantitatively elsewhere ( latter & tielens , in preparation ) . to first order",
    ", a pdr in a lower density region will have the ionized / neutral interface farther from the central source when compared to a higher density region .",
    "similarly , the region of strongest 2  fuv excitation will be farther out and have a somewhat larger linear extent than in a higher density region .",
    "this h/2  interface region will approximately follow iso - column density contours at @xmath93 @xmath17 or @xmath94 magnitudes .",
    "details will depend strongly on the exact distribution of material .",
    "but , it is evident that an axially symmetric distribution of circumstellar material of the type discussed above will produce a pdr morphology like that observed in 7027 .",
    "more specifically , it is expected to be an ellipsoidal or bipolar h@xmath95/h@xmath96 interface , surrounded by a bipolar bubble structure defining the h/2  interface and revealed in fuv excited 2emission  like that modeled here .",
    "somewhat farther out , the c / co interface region is , as shown by the data of @xcite , consistent with that found for the inner regions .",
    "the morphological evolution of the h@xmath95/h@xmath96 interface region and the ionized core is not predicted by strict pdr evolution alone .",
    "the internal density structure appears to have equilibrated in the shell and cavity (  4.2 ) because the sound crossing time is much shorter than the expansion timescale .",
    "the outward motion of this interface will be faster in the lower density polar regions , magnifying the asymmetric shape .",
    "if the star is on the cooling track , then the ionization front might better be described as a `` recombination '' front as the number of ionizing photons goes down ( schoenberner 1999 , personal communication ) .",
    "nested hourglass shapes and ellipsoids are predicted by numerical hydrodynamical simulations ( such as @xcite ; @xcite ) , but for interaction speeds much higher than so far seen in ngc 7027 .",
    "in addition , the molecular hydrogen emission from ngc 7027 is from a strong pdr , not a shocked wind interface .",
    "there is similarity in the overall morphology of the pdr , including the ionized core in ngc 7027 to emission morphologies predicted in strong interacting winds starting in an axisymmetric density distribution . because of this apparent similarity , a full description of the observed structure and its evolution requires coupled time - dependent pdr and hydrodynamic modeling . when combined with detailed chemical modeling of the neutral regions , the data presented here can be used to determine the exact density distribution of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "in a detailed multiwavelength study , graham ( 1993a ) found that uniform , radial expansion of a prolate spheroid , tilted to the line of sight is consistent with the millimeter - wave ( co ) position - velocity maps .",
    "however the co p - v diagram differs from the h@xmath5 p - v diagram presented here .",
    "this is not unexpected since the observed emission from the two molecules is produced under very different excitation conditions . therefore the two molecules trace different spatial / kinematical structures .",
    "observations have been made with the `` bear '' instrument ( a 256@xmath3256 pixel hgcdte camera coupled to a fourier transform spectrometer , with a spectral resolution  52.2 ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "cox found that the velocity field appeared to them as an equatorial `` torus '' suggests that north pole is tilted away from observer .",
    "this result is inconsistent with our interpretation of the hst images , our 3-d modeling of those images , and the higher spectral resolution cshell data .",
    "the high spatial resolution and sensitivity of the hst images shows that the front part of the top rim lies in front of the the ionized nebula ( not behind ) , suggesting that the top ( northern side ) is tilted @xmath97 the observer .",
    "we can not resolve this discrepancy with the data available .",
    "we suggest that the spectral resolution available to cox ( 1997 ) was not sufficent to fully deconvolve the subtle , but complex velocity structure that must be present ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the model schematic given by jaminet ( 1991 ) shows the same orientation as cox ( north pole away ) for the fast molecular wind traced by co @xmath98 line emission , which presumably has a similar flow direction as the ionized gas .",
    "it is entirely possible that the flow along the back of the cone ( or bubble ) has been confused with a flow along the polar axis , which in our model would not be the dominant emitting region .",
    "bains ( 1997 ) found from their high spectral resolution radio and optical observations , an orientation for ngc 7027 that is consistent with ours : i.e. that the ne lobe is blue - shifted , sw lobe is red - shifted .",
    "a full modeling of pdr evolution is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we can , however , make an assessment of such pdr evolution based on available models .",
    "the morphological evolution of the pdr will depend most strongly on the distribution of material in the circumstellar envelope . for 7027",
    "the post - agb circumstellar envelope must have been axially symmetric with a gradual decrease in density from the equatorial region to the poles .",
    "a dense equatorial disk can not be ruled out , but there is no evidence in these data , or other molecular data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , that requires or even suggests one .",
    "for that reason , we consider such a structure as unlikely to be present .",
    "the density distribution appears typical for other post - agb objects with an equatorial to polar density contrast of @xmath99 , such that it is not as great as the extreme bipolar proto - pne ( see  [ h2e ] ) . in much less than the cooling timescale of the central star",
    ", the pdr will be established quickly in all directions , with the fastest evolution in the polar regions",
    ". the result will most likely be for 7027  to become a butterfly - type nebula similar in gross properties to ( e.g. ) ngc 2346 .",
    "wind interactions for this type of morphological evolution are not required .",
    "the timescale for pdr evolution is highly uncertain ( other timescales are discussed in  [ cs ] ) , but reasonable estimates can , and have been made ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for a constant mass loss rate and parameters typical of high mass loss rate carbon stars , the timescale for a pdr to completely move through the circumstellar envelope can be estimated by integrating the equations of molecular formation and destruction with respect to radius and time , as was done by @xcite . for a constant wind velocity @xmath100 , a constant mass loss rate @xmath101  yr@xmath11 , and a stellar luminosity @xmath102",
    ", it can be shown that the dissociation front travels a distance @xmath103 cm in @xmath104 with a pdr speed of @xmath105 ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "tielens suggested clumping as how the evolution is slowed in real nebulae .",
    "although widespread clumping and structure is seen in these data , it does not appear at the size scales required , or marginally so at best ( @xmath106 cm and @xmath107 mag ) . even if clumping is important in localized regions , it is more likely that we now know several of the assumptions used to derive this evolutionary timescale are not valid , and if properly accounted for will tend to increase the timescale .",
    "the mass loss rate is not constant .",
    "the `` ring '' structure clearly visible in afgl 2688 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) indicates a time varying mass loss rate on a timescale of hundreds of years .",
    "the same type of structures are seen in other objects observed ( @xcite ) , including 7027 ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the distribution of material is not spherical .",
    "the degree to which the mass loss rate is varying is not known . nor is how a non - spherical distribution of attenuating and shielding material will alter the evolutionary timescales ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "additional work must be done to characterize these properties and how they relate to evolution . from the above expression and an assessment of the impact of uncertain parameters",
    ", it seems likely that the timescale for 7027  to evolve away from its current state will be only a few hundred to a few thousand years ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "wind interactions will complicate the picture by adding hydrodynamic effects and changes to the density structure .",
    "however , evolution to the current epoch appears to be described fully by the interaction of fuv and ionizing photons with an agb wind that has ( or had ) a somewhat enhanced mass loss rate in the equatorial plane . while there is evidence for recent jet interactions with the outflow ,",
    "the jets have not dominated the morphological shaping .",
    "it is worth monitoring 7027  at very high spatial resolution for morphological changes caused by jets and uv photons over the next several decades .",
    "the hst / nicmos observations presented in this paper reveal the detailed structure and morphology of the young planetary nebula ngc 7027 with unprecedented clarity .",
    "the molecular photodissociation region is found to be of an apparently different overall structure from that of the ionized core .",
    "we have constructed 3-dimensional , axisymmetric models for the morphology of ngc 7027 based on these nicmos near - infrared data and hst archive visible light data .",
    "the object can be well described by three distinct components : an ellipsoidal shell that is the ionized core , a bipolar hourglass structure outside the ionized core that is the excited molecular hydrogen region ( or the photodissociation region ) , and a nearly spherical outer region seen in dust scattered light and is the cool , neutral molecular envelope .",
    "it is argued that such a structure is consistent with one which would be produced by a photodissociation region with a central source of far - ultraviolet photons surrounded by an axisymmetric distribution of gas and dust that has a decreasing total density with increasing angle toward the polar regions of the system .",
    "the central star is clearly revealed by these data .",
    "we are able to determine the most accurate value for the temperature of the star @xmath108 k with a luminosity of @xmath109 . from various indicators , including the central star timescale , dynamical timescale , and timescale for evolution of the photodissocation region , we conclude that ngc 7027 left the asymptotic giant branch 700 to 1000 years ago . for such rapid evolution",
    ", it is likely that objects like ngc 7027 do not go through a proto - planetary nebula phase that is longer than a few tens of years , and as such would be nearly undetectable during such a brief phase .",
    "there is strong evidence for one , and possibly two highly collimated bipolar jets in ngc 7027 .",
    "the jets themselves are not seen with the present data , but the disturbance caused by them is clearly visible .",
    "it is possible that this jet , or jets have shut off during the current epoch of evolution .",
    "such jets have been seen in other planetary nebulae , but ngc 7027 might be the youngest in terms of evolution .",
    "there are nonuniformities and wave - like structures seen in these data that must be caused by poorly understood instabilities in the outflowing wind .    we conclude that while wind interactions will be important to the future evolution of ngc 7027 , it is the evolution of the pdr , as the central star dissociates , then ionizes , the circumstellar medium , that will dominate the apparent morphological evolution of this object .",
    "this is in contrast to the idea that interacting winds always dominate the evolution and shaping of planetary nebulae .",
    "evolution driven by far - ultraviolet photons might be more common in planetary nebulae than has been previously thought ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". such photon - driven evolution will be more important in objects with higher mass central stars ( and therefore high luminosity , temperature , and uv flux ) , than in those with low mass stars .",
    "but , it is the high mass objects that also have the higher density molecular envelopes ejected during a high mass loss rate phase on the asymptotic giant branch , and as such will show the strongest emission from a photodissociation region .",
    "ngc 7027 is perhaps the most extreme example known at this time , but it is not unique  except for the important and very brief moment in evolution",
