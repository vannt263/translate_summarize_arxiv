    "the development of turbulence in shear flows poses a challenge of great theoretical and practical relevance @xcite . since the seminal work of @xcite on the onset of turbulent fluid motion in a circular pipe",
    ", this system has remained a paradigm for transition without linear instability , i.e.  subcritical transition . here , the boundary that separates the laminar flow from turbulence depends not only on the reynolds number ( ) , but also on the characteristics of ambient and external perturbations . in particular , the threshold in perturbation amplitude that must be exceeded to trigger transition scales as @xmath0 , with @xmath1 $ ] depending on the perturbation details @xcite .",
    "thus , if great care is taken to minimize all sources of disturbances , the flow can be kept laminar up to  as large as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that even long times after turbulence is initially triggered , relaminarisation to hagen - poiseuille flow may occur .",
    "@xcite systematically studied the probability of a turbulent trajectory surviving up to time @xmath3 , given by the survivor function @xmath4 they concluded that relaminaristaion occurs suddenly and that the process is memoryless , i.e.  lifetimes are exponentially distributed with @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the mean turbulent lifetime .",
    "this behavior had been previously observed in turbulent relaminarisation experiments in plane couette flow @xcite .",
    "the exponential distribution of lifetimes and sensitive dependence on initial conditions @xcite is consistent with the presence of a repellor in phase space , a strange saddle ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the skeleton of the saddle is then constructed from exact unstable solutions of the navier ",
    "stokes equations , and the simplest of such solutions correspond to nonlinear travelling waves , discovered numerically by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "close visits to such travelling waves in turbulent flows were reported in the experiments of @xcite and simulations by @xcite .",
    "recently , new classes of travelling waves solutions and relative periodic orbits have also been found @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the scaling of mean turbulent lifetimes as  is increased and proposed a divergence of reciprocal form @xmath7 , indicating that turbulence becomes self - sustained at @xmath8 . however , a limitation of the lifetime study of @xcite was the length of the periodic pipe used in their simulations ( @xmath9 ) , chosen to reduce computational costs . at @xmath10 the experimentally observed flow regimes consist of localized turbulent structures bounded by regions of laminar flow , so - called _ puffs _ @xcite .",
    "puffs have a length of about @xmath11 and are characterized by a sharp turbulent - laminar interface at the trailing edge and a slowly diffused leading edge ( see figure  [ fig : puff ] ) .",
    "thus , long periodic pipes are required to fully capture their relevant dynamics . the first experimental study to determine lifetimes in pipe flow",
    "was performed by @xcite , who carried out  _ reduction _ experiments following the methodology introduced by @xcite in plane couette flow . using a constant - mass - flux pipe of @xmath12 , they perturbed the laminar profile to generate a puff , then reduced  and measured the downstream distance at which the puff decayed .",
    "their study also supported a divergence of lifetimes of reciprocal form at @xmath13 .",
    "an experimental study performed in a gravity - driven pipe by @xcite , however , rendered an exponential scaling of @xmath6 with , indicating that turbulence may be transient for all finite .",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulations of a periodic constant - mass - flux @xmath14 pipe , which allowed for direct comparison with experiment for the first time .",
    "their results qualitatively supported the critical behavior observed by @xcite , although the extrapolated critical reynolds number @xmath15 was larger than the experimentally measured value .",
    "more recently , @xcite repeated the experimental study with substantial technical improvements over the setup of @xcite .",
    "the implementation of accurate temperature control and automatisation of the measurement techniques allowed them to prolong the observational time - span up to @xmath16 orders of magnitude , drastically extending all previous investigations .",
    "their measurements up to @xmath17 still exhibited relaminarisation and indicated a faster than exponential ( but non - diverging ) scaling of lifetimes with , providing evidence that puff turbulence is of transient nature . while the data of @xcite was incompatible with an exponential scaling , good agreement with the _",
    "super_-exponential scaling of @xcite calls for further numerical investigation .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive discussion on the scaling of turbulent lifetimes in pipe - flows , reconciling previous investigations and clarifying the sources of discrepancy . to this aim ,",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite have been extended in , observation times and sample sizes .",
    "this has substantially increased the statistical significance , rendering much reduced and accurate confidence intervals .",
    "a detailed account of the methodology and analysis of the data is presented and the influence of initial conditions is examined .",
    "the results are in close quantitative agreement with the recent experiments of @xcite in relaminarisation probabilities at each @xmath18 investigated , and hence support a super - exponential increase of the lifetimes with @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , it is found that the process is not memoryless for @xmath19 , suggesting a bifurcation event that gives rise to turbulent trajectories .",
    "consider an incompressible viscous fluid which is driven through a pipe of circular cross - section at a constant flow rate .",
    "the reynolds number is defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mean flow - speed , @xmath22 the pipe diameter and @xmath23 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "it is convenient to scale lengths by @xmath24 and velocities by @xmath25 in the navier - stokes equations , leading to @xmath26 these are supplied with no - slip boundary conditions at the pipe wall , whereas in the axial direction the pipe is periodic .",

    "stokes equations are solved in cylindrical coordinates @xmath27 using the hybrid spectral finite - difference method .",

    "this is sufficient to avoid the interaction between leading and trailing edge of the localized structure of a puff ( of approximately @xmath11 ) which would arise in short domains . in the radial direction",
    "the explicit finite - difference method has been used on @xmath36-point stencils in a grid of @xmath37 points .",

    "the disturbance quickly evolved into an ` equilibrium puff ' which remained constant in spatial extent while propagating downstream ( see figure  [ fig : puff ] ) .",
    "the puff was evolved for @xmath40 and snapshots of the full velocity field were recorded every @xmath41 , generating a collection of initial conditions .",
    "subsequently , runs at lower  were performed starting from these initial conditions and were monitored until the flow relaminarised .",
    "the criterion for relaminarisation was that the energy of the axially dependent modes drop below @xmath42 , at which point turbulent motions had decayed beyond recovery .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",

    "in order to shed light on the discrepancies in scaling of turbulent lifetimes present in the literature , we have extended the reynolds number range in the numerical simulations up to @xmath50 .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : proball]@xmath51 , showing survivor functions at several @xmath18 in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the sample sizes have been subsequently increased until each data - set unambiguously showed the exponential distribution . in particular , between @xmath52 and @xmath53 simulations",
    "were run for @xmath54 $ ] , whereas at @xmath55 only @xmath56 cases were simulated due to the computational costs incurred in very long time integrations . in addition , the simulations at @xmath55 were stopped when @xmath57 puffs had decayed , leaving only @xmath58 survivors at @xmath59 .    from the survivor functions in figure  [ fig :",
    "proball]@xmath51 escape rates @xmath60 have been estimated using and are shown as black circles in the logarithmic scale of figure  [ fig : scaling ] .",
    "confidence intervals at the @xmath49 level , obtained from , have been plotted and may be regarded as error bars due to sample size .",
    "the results of the high resolution runs and reductions from @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 to @xmath44 fall within the @xmath49 confidence interval of the default case and are only shown in the inset to avoid overlapping the figure .",
    "overall , the results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental relaminarisation probabilities of @xcite , shown as squares .",
    "with increasing , @xmath64 decreases extremely fast , corresponding to a super - exponential increase in turbulent lifetimes .",
    "it is worth noting that the measurements of @xcite extend up to @xmath17 , with their super - exponential fit providing a very good approximation over the full data set .",
    "the agreement with the simulations of @xcite is very good for @xmath65 .",
    "for @xmath19 we have shown that the lifetimes are not exponentially distributed ( vertical line ) .",
    "the discrepancy of the point at @xmath44 is attributed mainly to statistical uncertainty .",
    "there @xmath66 was estimated with @xmath67 simulations , of which only @xmath68 had decayed when truncated at @xmath69 .",
    "the upper end of their confidence interval is close to the experimental value of @xcite and the present computations , although there is still a small difference .",
    "we remark , for example , that had the @xmath67 initial conditions @xmath70 $ ] of figure  [ fig : num]@xmath43 been used here to estimate @xmath66 , the result would be compatible with the estimate provided by @xcite . the escape rates and confidence intervals shown in figure  [ fig : scaling ] are those given in their re - analysis @xcite , using bootstrapping . using the method in  [ sec : samp ] on their original data shifts the point at @xmath44 by only @xmath71 in the direction of the current data set , with a @xmath71 larger confidence interval than that shown .",
    "the experiments of @xcite appear to be shifted by @xmath72 in  with respect to the numerical simulations and later experiments of @xcite .",
    "their exponential fit , however , provides a good approximation of the slope of @xmath64 over @xmath73 orders of magnitude .",
    "similarly , applying a @xmath74 shift in , the data of @xcite overlaps for most of the range .",
    "significant differences between their results and the results presented here , then remain only for their two highest .",
    "a procedural difference is the manner in which the puffs were generated .",
    "it has been shown here and by @xcite , however , that the initial condition has no influence other than on @xmath75 .",
    "a more likely source of difference is the difficulty of inferring the lifetime from the data . at high @xmath18",
    ", a short pipe implies very few relaminarisations and therefore a very large range of possible @xmath6 according to ( [ eq : mle ] ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath76 @xcite obtained a mean lifetime of @xmath77 . for an observation distance of @xmath78 after reducing , this corresponds to @xmath79 decays out of @xmath48 experimental runs , yielding a confidence interval @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , we must acknowledge that @xcite were first to experimentally demonstrate the very rapid increase in lifetimes over a small range of reynolds numbers .",
    "the transition to turbulence in pipe flow has been recently linked to the presence of a strange saddle in the phase space of the navier  stokes equations ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "one of the predictions of this emerging paradigm is that the turbulent lifetimes , the time prior to escaping the saddle , should be exponentially distributed .",
    "we have shown that the distributions are indeed exponential by substantially increasing the sample size and thus reducing statistical uncertainty with respect to previous works . in order to recover the true escape rate , a substantially larger sample size than previously used",
    "is necessary .",
    "we have demonstrated that initial conditions from puffs at @xmath81 render the same characteristic lifetimes after reduction to @xmath44 , which verifies that the same turbulent state is visited .",
    "here , contrary to the possibility that the turbulent state be difficult to reach when changing the reynolds number , the number of trajectories which fail to approach the saddle is actually low ( small @xmath75 ) .",
    "this reflects structural similarity of the initial condition with the state at the final @xmath18 .",
    "interestingly , the onset of the exponential distributions is rather sharp in @xmath18 at about @xmath19 .",
    "this suggests a bifurcation event that gives rise to the strange saddle .",
    "the onset of meta - stable transients has been characterized in plane couette flow experiments by @xcite and @xcite , who measured the average turbulent fraction .",
    "the change in distributional shape revealed here provides an alternative reliable means of quantifying a lower bound for meta - stable turbulence , and is appropriate when considering single isolated disturbances .",
    "our results support the view of localised turbulence as a strange repellor , with lifetimes increasing super - exponentially with  as in the experiments of @xcite . a similar",
    "scaling has been recently reported by @xcite in taylor ",
