    "one class of core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion models is based on neutrino @xcite , mainly the delayed neutrino mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent 3d numerical studies have shown that the desired explosions are harder to achieve @xcite than what 2d numerical simulations had suggested ( for a summary of problems of the delayed neutrino mechanism see @xcite ) .",
    "the problems of the delayed - neutrino mechanism can be overcome if there is a strong wind , either from an accretion disk @xcite or from the newly born neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "such a wind is not part of the delayed - neutrino mechanism , and most researchers consider this wind to have a limited contribution to the explosion .",
    "another class of explosion mechanisms is the jittering - jet scenario @xcite .",
    "processes for ccsn explosion by jets were considered before the development of the jittering - jet scenario ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , most of these mhd models require a rapidly spinning core before collapse starts , and hence are limited to a small fraction of all ccsne .",
    "the jittering - jet scenario posits that _ all ccsne are exploded by jets_. recent observations ( e.g. @xcite ) show indeed that jets might have a much more general role in ccsne than what is expected in the neutrino - driven mechanisms and mechanisms that require rapidly rotating cores .",
    "in the jittering - jets scenario the sources of the angular momentum for disk formation are the convective regions in the core @xcite and instabilities in the shocked region of the collapsing core , e.g. , neutrino - driven convection or the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) .",
    "recent 3d numerical simulations show indeed that neutrino - driven convection and sasi are well developed in the first second after core bounce @xcite and the unstable spiral modes of the sasi can amplify magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the spiral modes with the amplification of magnetic fields build the ingredients necessary for jets launching .",
    "when the average specific angular momentum of the matter in the pre - collapse core is small relative to the amplitude of the specific angular momentum of these instabilities , intermittent jets - launching episodes with random directions occur .",
    "the two launching axes of the first two launching episodes define a plane . using the flash numerical code we set a numerical study of the accretion pattern that is likely to be formed after the first two launching episodes .",
    "the code and numerical set - up for the 3d simulations are described in section [ sec : setup ] .",
    "the accretion pattern following two jets - launching episodes , followed by a third episode , is described in section [ sec : accretion ] .",
    "our summery is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we study the accretion structure that result from multiple jets - launching episodes using the flash gasdynamical numerical code version 4.2 @xcite .",
    "the widely used flash code is a publicly available code for supersonic flow suitable for astrophysical applications .",
    "the simulations are done using the split ppm solver of flash .",

    "[ fig : res ] shows the resolution in our simulations as a function of distance from the center . in the inner part",
    "the cells size is 10 km , increasing with radius .",
    "we treat the spherical inner region of up to @xmath0 from the center as a hole .",
    "this means that we are not simulating the ns itself , nor the assumed accretion disk .",
    "the boundary condition at the edge of the hole is inflow only , meaning the velocity can not be positive in the radial direction unless we inject a jet at that specific zone .         to check the sensitivity of our simulations to the resolution",

    "eventually they will close on directions perpendicular to their axis as well , and expel the outer core and the rest of the star in all directions .",
