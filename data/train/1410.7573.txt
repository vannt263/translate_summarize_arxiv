    "following the measurement of the third lepton mixing angle , the so - called reactor angle @xmath4 @xcite , neutrino physics has entered the precision era .",

    "first hints of the cp - violating ( cpv ) phase @xmath7 have also been reported in global fits @xcite , and rapid progress can be expected with the next generation of oscillation experiments .",
    "the measurement of the reactor angle has had a major impact on models of neutrino mass and mixing , ruling out at a stroke models based on tribimaximal ( tbm ) lepton mixing @xcite , although , as we shall discuss in this paper , these patterns may survive in the neutrino sector , if charged lepton corrections are included .",
    "such tbm patterns can arise from `` direct '' models @xcite , in which the full klein symmetry ( @xmath8 generators ) of the neutrino mass matrix as well as the @xmath9 symmetry of the charged lepton mass matrix are subgroups of an underlying discrete family symmetry .",
    "alternatively , tbm mixing can arise from `` indirect '' models based on constrained sequential dominance ( csd )  @xcite with special family symmetry breaking vacuum alignments .    in response to",

    "the viability of these ideas can only be established by comparison with experiment , and a tractable approach to test large classes of models is to identify generic types of prediction associated with these models .",
    "a promising example of such a signature can be found in lepton mixing sum rules , which relate the three lepton mixing angles to the cpv oscillation phase @xmath7 , or more precisely to @xmath10 .",

    "these scenarios are motivated by grand unified theories ( guts ) where the approximately diagonal charged lepton mass matrix is related to the down - type quark mass matrix , together with the assumption that quark mixing arises predominantly from the down - type quark sector .",
    "indeed this was the case in the csd model where solar sum rules were first proposed @xcite . in the context of `` direct '' models , solar sum rules arise when the full klein group continues to emerge from the discrete family symmetry ( leading for example to tbm mixing in the neutrino sector ) while the @xmath9 generator which governs the charged leptons is broken .",
    "in the simple case where only @xmath30 are non - zero , with @xmath31 , the charged - lepton corrections do not change the third row of the neutrino mixing matrix , and solar sum rules can be derived from the conditions  @xcite | u_1 | = s^_12s^_23 ,  | u_2 | = c^_12s^_23 ,  | u_3 | = c^_23 , [ sol ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "<S> small discrete family symmetries such as s@xmath0 , a@xmath0 or a@xmath1 may lead to simple leading - order predictions for the neutrino mixing matrix such as the bimaximal , tribimaximal or golden ratio mixing patterns , which may be brought into agreement with experimental data with the help of corrections from the charged - lepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> such scenarios generally lead to relations among the parameters of the physical leptonic mixing matrix known as solar lepton mixing sum rules . in this article , we present a simple derivation of such solar sum rules , valid for arbitrary neutrino and charged lepton mixing angles and phases , assuming only @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss four leading - order neutrino mixing matrices with @xmath3 which are well motivated from family symmetry considerations . </S>",
