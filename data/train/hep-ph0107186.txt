    "the 30 + year old solar neutrino puzzle constitutes , together with the atmospheric neutrino puzzle , the only clean evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "what started off as a discrepancy between the expected and experimentally measured solar neutrino flux at the chlorine experiment in the homestake mine ( @xcite , and references therein ) , has now turned into , when the state - of - the - art superkamiokande @xcite and sno experiments @xcite are combined , strong evidence that active neutrinos other than @xmath4 ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath5 and/or @xmath6 ) are part of the solar neutrino flux @xcite",
    ".    however , when the solar neutrino puzzle is taken as evidence for neutrino oscillations , many issues remain .",
    "first , the solar neutrino data is yet to provide unambiguous evidence for oscillations , and even the evidence for neutrino conversion requires the combination of two different experiments ( this issue will soon be resolved after sno measures neutral current events ) .",
    "second , the current data is still unable to establish what is the generic value of the neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite . even if the recently disfavoured small mixing angle ( sma ) region is discarded , there are still a few disjoined values of @xmath7 which properly fit all the data .",
    "the ( preferred ) large mixing angle ( lma ) region contains values of @xmath8  ev@xmath9 and @xmath10 , while the `` low probability '' ( low ) , quasi - vacuum ( qvo ) , and just - so ( vac ) regions contain @xmath11  ev@xmath9 and @xmath12 . finally , it is still not clear whether the @xmath4 is oscillating into an active neutrino or a sterile neutrino . while the current data strongly disfavours pure @xmath13 oscillations ( @xmath14 is a @xmath15 singlet , sterile neutrino ) , the possibility that @xmath16 oscillates into a strongly mixed active @xmath17 sterile state is quite robust @xcite .",
    "the kamland reactor neutrino experiment @xcite , which is to start taking data soon , is sensitive to the lma region of the solar neutrino parameter space .",
    "after a few years of data taking , it is capable of either excluding the entire region or not only establishing @xmath18 oscillations , but also of measuring the oscillation parameters @xmath19 with unprecedented precision @xcite .    even in the case of a positive signal for oscillations at kamland , a few outstanding issues will remain .",
    "because kamland is sensitive to @xmath20 charged current events only , it is unable to tell whether the @xmath4 oscillates into an active or a sterile state . furthermore , because it is a `` short '' baseline experiment , it is insensitive to matter effects , and therefore can not separate the `` light '' from the `` dark '' side of the parameter space @xcite ( _ i.e. , _ tell @xmath21 from @xmath22 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we try to determine what extra information will be gained when the kamland results are combined with the current solar neutrino data collected by homestake , sage , gallex , gno , kamiokande / superkamiokande , and sno @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that , for three years of kamland `` data : '' _ ( i ) _  for a significant portion of the lma region , we should be able to separate the light from the dark side at more than 95% confidence level ( cl ) , given that the kamland data is precise enough to rule out maximal mixing with the same precision ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "if kamland sees a signal , we can establish that the @xmath14 component of the `` other '' neutrino is smaller than @xmath23 at the 99%  cl .",
    "this bound , however , is sensitive to the values of @xmath7 and @xmath24 which are to be measured at kamland .",
    "if kamland does not see a signal , this upper bound is @xmath25 at the 99%  cl . _",
    "( iii ) _  if kamland does not see a signal for oscillations , the solar data will point to the low , qvo , or vac regions , while the sma region should still be allowed at the @xmath26  sigma level .",
    "our presentation is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the kamland experiment , and discuss the details of our simulations of kamland data and data analysis . in sec .  3",
    ", we discuss the consequences of combining kamland and solar data if there is evidence for @xmath20 disappearance at kamland , while in sec .  4 we discuss the status of the solar neutrino puzzle in the advent that kamland sees no suppression of the reactor @xmath20 flux .",
    "5 we summarise our results and conclude .",
    "the kamland detector , located inside a mine in japan ( in the site of the old kamiokande experiment ) , consists of roughly 1 kton of liquid scintillator surrounded by photomultiplier tubes .",
    "it is sensitive to the @xmath20 flux from some 10 + reactors which are located `` nearby . ''",
    "the distances from the different reactors to the experimental site vary from slightly more than 80  km to over 800  km , while the majority ( roughly 80% ) of the neutrinos travel from 140  km to 215  km ( see , _",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "kamland `` sees '' the antineutrinos by detecting the total energy deposited by recoil positrons , which are produced via @xmath27 .",
    "the total visible energy corresponds to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the kinetic energy of the positron and @xmath30 the electron mass .",
    "the positron energy , on the other hand , is related to the incoming antineutrino energy @xmath31  mev up to corrections related to the recoil momentum of the daughter neutron ( 1.293  mev is the neutron ",
    "proton mass difference ) .",
    "kamland is expected to measure the visible energy with a resolution which is expected to be better than @xmath32 , for @xmath33 in mev @xcite .    in order to simulate events at kamland",
    ", we need to compute the expected energy spectrum for the incoming reactor antineutrinos for different values of the neutrino mass - squared differences and mixing angles .",
    "the antineutrino spectrum which is to be measured at kamland depends on the power output and fuel composition of each reactor ( both change slightly as a function of time ) , and on the cross section for @xmath27 . for the results presented here",
    ", we assume a constant chemical composition for the fuel of all reactors ( explicitly , 53.8% of @xmath34u , 32.8% of @xmath35pu , 7.8% of @xmath36u , and 5.6% of @xmath37pu , see @xcite ) .",
    "effects due to the time variation of the fuel composition have been studied in @xcite , and are small ( although they have to be taken into account in the `` real '' data analysis , of course ) .",
    "the shape of energy spectrum of the incoming neutrinos can be derived from a phenomenological parametrisation , obtained in @xcite , @xmath38 where the coefficients @xmath39 depend on the parent nucleus .",
    "the values of @xmath39 for the different isotopes we used are tabulated in @xcite .",
    "these expressions are very good approximations of the ( measured ) reactor flux for values of @xmath40  mev .",
    "the cross section for @xmath27 has been computed including corrections related to the recoil momentum of the daughter neutron in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the energy spectrum of antineutrinos produced at nuclear reactors has been measured with good accuracy at previous reactor neutrino experiments ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "for this reason , we will assume that the expected ( unoscillated ) antineutrino energy spectrum is know precisely .",
    "some of the effects of uncertainties in the incoming flux on the determination of oscillation parameters have been studied in @xcite , and are supposedly small .",
    "finally , we have to include the effects of neutrino oscillations . here",
    ", we will constrain ourselves to the simplest two - level system , _",
    "i.e. , _ we assume @xmath41 oscillations governed by only one mass - squared difference @xmath7 ( which is the `` solar '' @xmath7 ) and one mixing angle ( we choose @xmath24 as the physical variable in order to separate the light side ( @xmath0 ) from the dark side ( @xmath1 ) of the parameter space @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , according to @xcite , the kamland experiment should not have enough sensitivity to distinguish a nonzero @xmath42 from zero , given the current bound provided by the chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "this being the case , the ( energy dependent ) electron antineutrino survival probability at kamland is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance of reactor @xmath45 to kamland in @xmath46 , @xmath47 is in gev and @xmath7 is in ev@xmath9 , while @xmath48 is the fraction of the total neutrino flux which comes from reactor @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) , which we assume is constant as a function of time .",
    "does vary as a function of time . this effect , of course ,",
    "will be considered in the analysis of real experimental data . ]    with all these ingredients at hand , we simulate kamland data for different values of @xmath24 and @xmath7 in 12 visible energy bins of width @xmath49  kev , restricting ourselves to neutrino energies above 2  mev and below 8  mev .",
    "the width of the bin is chosen according to the expected energy resolution , the low energy cutoff is included in order to respect the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) , and the high energy cutoff is included in order to avoid bins with too few events , such that a gaussian approximation for the statistical errors can be safely used .",
    "finally , we define one `` kamland - year '' as the amount of time it takes kamland to see 800 events with visible energy above 1.22  mev .",
    "this is roughly what is expected after one year of running ( assuming a fiducial volume of 1 kton ) , if all reactors run at ( constant ) @xmath50 of their maximal power output @xcite .",
    "our simulated data sets are analysed via a standard @xmath51 function , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of simulated events in the @xmath54-th energy bin , and @xmath55 is the theoretical prediction for this number of events as a function of the oscillation parameters .",
    "@xmath56 is the total number of bins , while @xmath57 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this is done in order to estimate the statistical capabilities of an _ average _ experiment .",
    "an alternative option would be to include random statistical fluctuations in the simulated data . in this case , the appropriate definition of @xmath51 would be eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) minus @xmath57 .",
    "note that we assume statistical errors only , and do not include background induced events .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable assumption , given that kamland is capable of tagging the @xmath20 by looking for a delayed @xmath58 signal due to the absorption of the recoil neutron .",
    "however , `` geophysical '' @xmath20 may prove to be irreducible background at the low energy bins ( @xmath59  mev ) @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we discuss in the appendix results of a modified analysis of kamland `` data , '' where the events contained in the lowest energy bins are discarded .",
    "if the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle lies in the lma region , kamland should not only see a signal , but also determine @xmath24 , @xmath7 with unprecedented precision @xcite .",
    "[ fig : points](top ) depicts 90% , three sigma , and five sigma confidence level ( cl ) contours obtained for different simulated input values of @xmath24 , @xmath7 , after three kamland - years of `` data . ''",
    "these contour are defined by plotting contours of constant @xmath61 , while the cl are defined for two degrees of freedom ( @xmath62 for 90% , three , and five sigma cl , respectively ) .",
    "three important comments are in order .",
    "first , as observed in @xcite , for @xmath63  ev@xmath9 , the determination of @xmath7 is rather ambiguous .",
    "this is due to the fact that if @xmath7 is too large , the kamland energy resolution is not sufficiently high in order to resolve the oscillation lengths associated with these values of @xmath7 and @xmath47 .",
    "second , there is a discrete degeneracy in the allowed parameter space , as @xmath21 can not be separated from @xmath22 ( @xmath24 from @xmath64 ) .",
    "third , although @xmath24 , @xmath7 can be very well determined , we have no information regarding whether the @xmath4 is oscillating into an active neutrino , a sterile neutrino , or a linear combination of the two .",
    "the reason for this , as has been emphasised before , is that kamland sees only charged current events , and that matter effects are completely negligible at kamland - like baselines .",
    "next , we add our simulated kamland data to the current solar data , including the recent result published by sno @xcite .",
    "the procedure for analysing the solar data is the same as the one adopted in @xcite , where we refer the readers for details .",
    "in particular , the analysis includes the event rates measured at homestake and sno ( `` charged current '' data only ) , the average of the event rates measured at sage , gallex and gno , and the superkamiokande data , binned in energy for the day and night events .",
    "furthermore , we include the theoretical errors on the neutrino fluxes according to the results of bp2000 calculations @xcite .",
    "we define a combined @xmath51 function in the straightforward way : @xmath65 fig .",
    "[ fig : points](bottom ) depicts 90% , three sigma , and five sigma  cl contours obtained for different simulated input values for @xmath24 , @xmath7 , using the combined solar data plus three kamland - years of `` data , '' assuming that the @xmath4 oscillates into a pure active state . as before ,",
    "we define the confidence level contours by plotting contours of constant @xmath66 , this time computed with eq .",
    "( [ eq : combined ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : points](bottom ) also depicts the lma region of the parameter which is allowed by current data at the 90% , 95% , 99% , and three sigma  cl .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a few important features should be readily noted .",
    "first , the size of the 90% and three sigma contours _ in the light side _ are almost identical when one compares fig .",
    "[ fig : points](top ) [ kamland only ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : points](bottom ) [ kamland plus solar ] , with the exception of the point located at a very large value of @xmath67  ev@xmath9 ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : points](top ) by an up - side - down triangle ) . at this point ,",
    "the number of separated `` islands '' allowed at the three sigma level decreases slightly .",
    "the five sigma contours , on the other hand , are slightly reduced when the solar data is included in the fit .",
    "this is particularly true when the input values of the oscillation parameters are `` far '' from the current lma best fit point ( indicated by a star ) .",
    "second , the `` mirror symmetry '' about the maximal mixing axis ( @xmath68 ) is broken .",
    "indeed , in most cases , the addition of the solar data allows one to claim a `` strong hint , '' at more than 90%  cl , that the @xmath4 is predominantly light . at five sigma , however , none of the points depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : points ] allows for a `` discovery '' of this ( fundamental ) fact .",
    "one curious feature is that , for very small values of @xmath7 , the five sigma  cl contour may be smaller in the light side than in the dark side , while the best fit point is well defined to be in the light side .",
    "this behaviour is most clear in the point marked with an asterix , and is due to the fact that the region below @xmath69  ev@xmath9 and @xmath70 is strongly disfavoured by the absence of a day - night effect at superkamiokande .    in sec .",
    "3.1 , we analyse in more detail the ability of the current solar data to separate the light from the dark side of the parameter space , once kamland data becomes available ( and if an oscillation signal is observed ) . in sec .",
    "3.2 , we discuss what a combined solar and kamland data analysis will have to say about a sterile component in @xmath71 oscillations .      in order to address this issue ,",
    "we compute the following `` discrimination function '' @xmath72 which is defined for @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig : f ] depicts contours of constant @xmath74 in the @xmath75-plane for @xmath76  ev@xmath9 .",
    "@xmath74 is best interpreted in the following way : if the best fit point obtained by analysing the solar data ( combined or not with kamland data ) is @xmath77 , than the mirror symmetric point @xmath78 is ruled out at the @xmath79  cl , where the value of @xmath79 is determined by @xmath80 for two degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , if any of the points which lie on the @xmath81 contour in fig .",
    "[ fig : f ] happens to be the best fit point , its symmetric point on the `` other '' side will be ruled out at the 95%  cl .",
    "[ fig : f ] also depicts the lma @xmath82  cl region ( defined for two d.o.f . ) .",
    "for a sizeable portion of it , @xmath74 is bigger than 5.99 , meaning that we can expect to be able to separate the dark from the light side of the parameter space at the 95%  cl for a significant part of the currently preferred region of the solar neutrino parameter space .",
    "this conclusions depends , of course , on whether the kamland data by itself can discriminate the obtained best fit point from maximal mixing ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "note that , according to the current solar data , a five sigma `` discovery '' that the electron - type neutrino is predominantly light ( or heavy ) , is not allowed by the current solar neutrino data .",
    "the largest value of @xmath83 occurs very close to the best fit point indicated by the solar data . at this point",
    ", one can tell the dark from the light side at the 99.68%  cl .",
    "so far , we have assumed that @xmath4 oscillated into a pure active state @xmath85 .",
    "next we consider the more general case of @xmath86 oscillations , where @xmath87 is a linear combination of active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "explicitly , we define the mixing angle @xmath88 such that @xmath89 note that we still assume that the @xmath4 is contained entirely in the two mass eigenstates whose mass difference is responsible for solving the solar neutrino puzzle . and",
    "@xmath90 to be the mass eigenstates whose mass squared difference can be associated to @xmath91 , this approximation corresponds to @xmath92 , while @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "] it is then possible to define oscillation probabilities , compute event rates at the various experiments in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath24 , and @xmath94 , and therefore compute @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "note that for kamland the situation is trivial , as @xmath96 is independent of @xmath94 .",
    "in order to study what are the preferred values of @xmath94 , we follow the standard procedure of defining a one parameter @xmath51 function such that @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the values of @xmath99 which minimise @xmath51 for each value of @xmath94 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : sterile ] depicts @xmath100 as a function of @xmath94 , for different scenarios .",
    "the curve labelled `` best '' is obtained assuming that three kamland - years of `` data '' are consistent with the current best fit point ( @xmath101  ev@xmath9 , indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : points ] by a star ) to the solar data assuming pure @xmath102 oscillations , while the curve labelled `` worst '' is obtained assuming that three kamland - years of data are consistent with the best fit point in the would be lma region assuming pure @xmath103 ( @xmath104  ev@xmath9 , indicated in fig .  [ fig : points ] by a circle ) .",
    "the dashed line labelled `` solar only '' is obtained if only the current solar data are included in the fit .",
    "three important features should be noted .",
    "first , @xmath105 is always the best fit point .",
    "this is information contained in the current solar data by itself , of course .",
    "second , the solar data by itself sets an upper bound @xmath106 at the @xmath107cl , respectively .",
    "third , if three kamland - years of data are consistent with the `` best '' point , the upper bounds on @xmath94 become slightly tighter ( @xmath108 at the @xmath107cl ) , while if three kamland - years of data are consistent with the `` worst '' point the bounds actually become looser ( @xmath109 at the @xmath107cl ) .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is the following : while kamland does not have the ability to discriminate active from sterile oscillations , it affects @xmath110 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2_zeta ] ) by modifying the values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 . roughly speaking , the kamland data almost `` fixes '' @xmath111 and @xmath112 to the value chosen in the simulated kamland data ( see fig .  [ fig : points](top ) ) , independent of @xmath94 . at `` best , ''",
    "this phenomenon is quite visible : it forbids one to change the value of @xmath24 and @xmath7 in order to obtain a better fit , and the upper bound on @xmath94 becomes stronger . at `` worst ,",
    "'' a different manifestation of the same thing is present : the point `` worst '' is not particularly preferred by the current solar data , but the presence of kamland `` forces '' it to be the best fit point .",
    "it happens that the increase ( with respect to the current best fit point ) in @xmath113 is larger at @xmath105 than at @xmath114 , and for this reason the discrimination between pure active and pure sterile oscillations is poorer than the `` solar only '' case .",
    "if the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle does not lie in the lma region , the kamland data should be consistent with the hypothesis that the electron - type antineutrinos do not oscillate .",
    "three kamland - years of `` data '' consistent with no oscillations prove enough to rule out the entire lma region , at more than three sigma  cl ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : no_signal ] depicts the `` left - over '' parameter space if this were the case .",
    "note that , here , we are performing fits with three free parameters , ( @xmath115 ) , and fig .  [ fig : no_signal ] depicts the ( @xmath116)-plane for two fixed values of @xmath117 ( left and right , respectively ) .",
    "confidence level contours are therefore computed for three degrees of freedom .",
    "as expected , fig .",
    "[ fig : no_signal ] resembles fig .  1 in @xcite",
    ", with the lma solution `` chopped off . ''",
    "some quantitative differences are worthy of comment .",
    "for example , the best fit point is in the low region , while the entire range of values of @xmath7 which connect the low region to the vac region ( the qvo region ) is allowed at more than @xmath118 cl .",
    "furthermore , the sma region , which is allowed by the current data only at the @xmath82 cl ( according to the analysis performed in the spirit of @xcite ) , would be allowed at the @xmath119 cl defined for three degrees of freedom .",
    "if this happens to be the result obtained by the kamland experiment , we will probably have to wait for the upcoming borexino experiment @xcite in order to learn more about solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "in particular , the search for anomalous seasonal variations at borexino should either exclude or establish the vac and part of the qvo region , in which case oscillations parameters may be measured with reasonably good precision @xcite . on the other hand , the search for a day - night asymmetry at borexino should either exclude or establish the low and part of the qvo solution , in which case oscillations parameters may also be measured with reasonably good precision @xcite .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : sterile ] depicts @xmath120 as a function of @xmath94 if the kamland data does not see a signal for oscillations ( dot - dashed line , labelled `` no signal '' ) . in this case , one would be able to set an upper bound @xmath121 at the 90%  ( 99% )  cl , while at three sigma even values of @xmath114 would be allowed ( as can be directly confirmed by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : no_signal ] ) .",
    "we have considered the consequences of combining the current solar neutrino data with future kamland reactor data .",
    "the main motivation for doing this is that while kamland can explore the entire lma region of the solar neutrino solution space and measure the oscillation parameters with great precision , we will need extra input , which can only be provided by solar neutrino experiments ( at least for the time being ) , in order to address two important issues : first , we would like to decide whether the electron - type neutrino is predominantly light or heavy , _",
    "i.e. , _ decide whether the solar angle is larger or smaller than @xmath122 ( in the convention where the mass - squared hierarchy of the mass eigenstates is fixed @xcite ) .",
    "second , we would like to know whether the electron - type neutrino mixes with the other known , active states ( the muon- and tau - type neutrino ) , or whether it is ( also ) mixed with an unknown sterile neutrino state .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that if the lsnd anomaly @xcite is also interpreted in terms of neutrino oscillations , sterile neutrinos _",
    "we find that the current solar data do not allow a `` discovery '' ( at the five sigma level ) signal for @xmath0 ( or @xmath123 ) if kamland sees a signal for @xmath20 disappearance , while a two sigma strong evidence may be claimed for a large part of the 99% cl lma region , if one assumes pure active oscillations .",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar if any `` amount '' of sterile mixing is present .",
    "ev@xmath9 and pure sterile oscillations , the data prefers values of @xmath21 in the dark side ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "of course , such scenario is severely constrained by the current solar data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sterile ] ) . ] the big caveat , of course , is that the kamland data should be able to rule out maximal mixing ( @xmath68 ) with comparable confidence .",
    "we also find that while kamland has no power to discriminate active from sterile oscillations , the kamland data will modify the current upper bound on a sterile neutrino component in `` solar '' oscillations .",
    "curiously enough , depending on the result obtained by kamland , this bound may improve or deteriorate when compared to an analysis performed with the current solar data only .",
    "if kamland does not see evidence for @xmath20 disappearance , the lma region of the parameter space will be completely ruled out .",
    "the current solar data would , in this case , point to the low / qvo / vac regions , while the sma region would still be allowed at the two sigma level .",
    "if this is the case , data from the borexino experiment will probably be required if we want to finally piece the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "we would like to emphasise that most of the results presented here and summarised in the previous paragraphs are obtained from the _ current solar data , _ and do not depend on the kamland `` data . '' in particular",
    ", the conclusions we reach should apply whenever the kamland data is `` precise enough '' to either completely rule out the entire lma region at a sufficiently high confidence level , or measure @xmath24 and @xmath7 values in the lma region with significantly higher precision than the solar data . until that is the case",
    ", the lack of convincing absence or presence of signal at kamland will either slowly `` drown '' the lma solution ( if it does not contain the correct solution to the solar neutrino puzzle ) or create other potential degeneracies in the parameter space ( one could picture a `` best solar '' versus `` best kamland '' degeneracy problem ) .",
    "incidently , this type of `` unresolved '' scenario may indeed be upon us when the first results from kamland are released , perhaps before the summer of 2002 @xcite !    of course , as more solar data accumulates , the situation regarding the issues studied here may change . in particular , the sno detector is still to measure the `` neutral current '' event rate @xcite , while more information will be obtained once the number of observed `` charged current '' events increases , and sno is able to study the variation of the data sample as a function of time ( day - night effect ) and energy .",

    "the kamland data sample may be plagued by an irreducible background of low energy @xmath20 , produced in the surrounding rock @xcite .",

    "[ fig : points_new](bottom ) depicts 90% and three sigma  cl contours obtained for different simulated input values for @xmath24 , @xmath7 , using the combined solar data plus three kamland - years of `` data '' minus the three lowest energy bins , assuming that the @xmath4 oscillates into a pure active state .",
    "this is to be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : points](bottom ) in sec .  3 .",
    "even if the cl contours are visibly bigger when one excludes the three lowest energy bins ( as expected ) , three `` kamland - years '' is more than enough to obtain a clean `` measurement '' of @xmath7 and @xmath24 , at least at the three sigma level .",
    "of course , the problem of multiple solutions at large mass - squared differences now plagues even smaller values of @xmath7 , while the precision with which one can determine oscillation parameters at @xmath7 close to 10@xmath125  ev@xmath9 is significantly worse , as expected .",
    "note that , as we advertise in sec .  3.1 , the ability of the solar data to distinguish the light and dark sides does not depend on how well kamland can measure the oscillation parameters .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the solar data in the analysis is more pronounced in the light side , especially at @xmath7 close to 10@xmath125  ev@xmath9 .",
    "for example , while the kamland result is unable to exclude maximal mixing at 90%  cl at the simulated point correspoding to @xmath126  ev@xmath9 ( labeled by a square ) , the inclusion of the solar data significantly reduces the 90% .",
