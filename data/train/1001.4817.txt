    "sphaleron processes are required to convert lepton number into baryon number @xcite , and these conversions will produce magnetic fields .",
    "the power spectra of fields produced during leptogenesis , however , may be different from those produced during baryogenesis as considered here because , unlike baryogenesis , leptogenesis does not rely on a first order phase transition for departures from thermal equilibrium .",
    "we assume that baryogenesis occurred at the electroweak scale and the necessary departures from thermal equilibrium are provided by a phase transition that was strong enough .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is broken within bubbles which then grow , merge and eventually fill all of space , thus completing the phase transition . during this process",
    ", baryon number changes can occur relatively freely outside the bubbles since there is little energy cost associated with the sphaleron in the symmetric phase , but baryon number changes are highly suppressed within the bubbles since the sphaleron has mass @xmath44 in the symmetry broken phase .",
    "( here @xmath45 gev is the mass of the electroweak w gauge boson . ) also , in the symmetric phase that is outside the bubbles , the electromagnetic magnetic field is just a linear combination of the electroweak magnetic fields , and has no special significance .",
    "for example , all the electoweak gauge fields are massless , and we expect rapid interactions to maintain equilibrium between the different degrees of freedom . inside the bubbles ,",
    "the electromagnetic field is the only massless gauge field and its evolution is described by maxwell s equations .",
    "however , there are no sphaleron transitions inside the bubble and so no magnetic fields are generated there .",
    "it is only the sphaleron transitions occuring in a thin region right around the bubble wall which produce the magnetic fields that are then captured by the growing bubble .",
    "it is this magnetic field , generated by sphaleron transitions at the surface of bubbles , that is of interest to us .    a schematic picture of our model is shown in fig .",
    "[ schematics ] .",
    "essentially , there are bubbles of the broken symmetry phase that nucleate and grow , and sphalerons are explosions that occur on the surfaces of these bubbles and blow out magnetic fields into the environment .",
    "we would like to find the correlation functions of the magnetic fields left - over after the phase transition has completed .",
    "our picture of the phase transition is similar to that of cosmological large - scale structure formation in which cosmic voids nucleate and grow .",
    "supernovae or other astrophysical activity occurs on the surfaces and intersections of the voids and expels magnetic fields and other elements into the cosmic environment .",
    "the only element that is missing from the picture so far is a model for the `` explosion '' that expels the magnetic field . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the decay of the sphaleron was studied numerically , with the result that magnetic helicity stayed constant at late times , and the energy density spread out as time progressed .",
    "we shall model the magnetic field in a sphaleron explosion as @xmath46 where @xmath47 are spherical coordinates centered at the location of the sphaleron and the z - axis is chosen so that there is azimuthal symmetry .",
    "( plots of two sections of the magnetic field are shown in fig .",
    "[ b - plots ] . )",
    "the @xmath48 components of the magnetic field are chosen to be approximately those of a current - carrying circular loop of wire of radius @xmath49 , and with current proportional to @xmath50 .",

    "the size of the whole system is chosen to grow with time to model the exploding sphaleron .",
    "assuming that the magnetic fields generated by the sphaleron expand out at the speed of light , we can take @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the epoch at which the sphaleron transition occurred .",
    "the scalings with @xmath49 are important since the magnetic helicity in the aftermath of a sphaleron decay stays constant , as we now show explicitly .",
    "we first construct the gauge potential for the azimuthal component of the magnetic field @xmath54 in other words , @xmath55 now we define @xmath56 where , @xmath57 @xmath58 and , correspondingly , @xmath59 so that @xmath60",
    ". then since the helicities in @xmath61 and @xmath62 are individually zero , the total helicity is given by the cross terms @xmath63 an integration by parts is now used to obtain @xmath64 the boundary term vanishes because the fields are localized .",
    "next we insert the expressions for the gauge potential and magnetic field as given in eqs .",
    "( [ bchoice ] ) , ( [ aazim ] ) .",
    "a simple change of variables , @xmath65 , shows that the magnetic helicity of one source is @xmath66 for any value of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the magnetic helicity is conserved for our choice of magnetic fields and matches the conservation seen in sphaleron decay @xcite .",
    "the choice of factors of @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ bchoice ] ) also ensures that the relative energy in each of the three components of the magnetic field stays fixed , while the net energy in the magnetic field decays as @xmath50 .",
    "the decay of the magnetic energy is a necessary consequence of the conservation of helicity because the energy density is @xmath67 while the helicity density is @xmath68 and hence , simply by counting dimensions , the total energy is the total helicity divided by a length scale . since the only length scale in the problem is @xmath49 and the total helicity remains constant , the total energy must decay as @xmath50 .    the magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ bchoice ] ) is axially symmetric about the chosen z - axis .",
    "however , different sphalerons will produce magnetic fields that are azimuthally symmetric with respect to different axes .",
    "so a sphaleron is described by its location as well as its orientation .",
    "we will assume that the orientations of the sphalerons are isotropically distributed and , for a given sphaleron , choose the orientation from a uniform distribution on the two - sphere _",
    "i.e. _ in spherical coordinates , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are chosen from a uniform distribution over the intervals @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively . in principle , the interaction of electroweak fields with the bubble wall could result in a preferential orientation of the sphaleron ( e.g. normal to the bubble wall ) but we shall disregard this possibility in the present paper .    we do not claim that an electroweak sphaleron produces the magnetic field in eq .",

    "( [ bchoice ] ) is a convenient choice for the magnetic field and has the following desirable properties : ( i ) the field is smooth and divergenceless .",
    "( ii ) the magnetic helicity is independent of @xmath49 .",
    "( iii ) the relative energy in all three components of the magnetic field is independent of @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , we are only interested in the correlation functions for the magnetic field at large separations and hope that these are not sensitive to the exact form of the model we choose for the sphaleron s magnetic field . to put this work on a firmer footing , it will be necessary to study the process of sphaleron decay more carefully and to devise a more accurate model for the magnetic fields produced .",
    "the procedure we follow is to throw bubble sites randomly with uniform distribution within our simulation volume .",
    "successful bubble sites are those that lie outside of all existing bubbles",
    ". then the bubbles grow at speed @xmath73 .",
    "the bubble growth velocity depends on the ambient plasma and can be much smaller than the speed of light ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , to keep the number of parameters to a minimum in our simulations , we took @xmath74 .",
    "as the bubbles grow , we randomly nucleate sphalerons on the bubble surfaces with angular density @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the average area per sphaleron . here",
    "also we take care to eliminate sphaleron sites that lie within pre - existing bubbles .",
    "each sphaleron is described by its time of nucleation , location , as well as its orientation .",
    "the sphaleron nucleation time enters the factor @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ bchoice ] ) , while the spatial location sets the origin for the axes , and the orientation of the sphaleron fixes the direction of the local @xmath77-axis . with time , the radius of the magnetic field grows with velocity @xmath78 which , for convenience , is also taken to be the speed of light , @xmath79 .",
    "after the phase transition is complete  no more bubbles nucleate since almost all the simulation volume is occupied by pre - existing bubbles  we find the magnetic field on a lattice within our simulation volume due to all sphalerons in our simulation box .",
    "we then compute the correlation function , @xmath80 ( eq .  ( [ spacecorrelator ] ) , which has @xmath81 components because of the 2 free indices @xmath82 and the 3 choices for the direction of @xmath83 .",
    "the simulation is run many times with different seeds for the random number generator and ensemble averages are calculated .",
    "we have explicitly checked that the correlators are of the form in eq .",
    "( [ spacecorrelator ] ) . then the spectral functions are found as linear combinations of the @xmath84 , @xmath85 where the sum is over the 3 directions : @xmath86 .",
    "the simulation takes care that bubbles can only nucleate in the false vacuum region , that is , outside every other bubble . in practice ,",
    "a certain number , @xmath3 , of bubbles are thrown down at every time step , and any bubbles that lie within pre - existing bubbles are rejected . next we want to locate sphaleron events on the surfaces of existing bubbles .",
    "we let @xmath76 denote the mean area occupied by a sphaleron on the surface of the bubble . on the surface of a bubble of radius @xmath87",
    ", we throw @xmath88 sphaleron sites where we take @xmath89 so that there are a large number of sphalerons ( order @xmath90 ) in the simulation but still within computational limits .",
    "we reject those sites that lie within any other bubble . for large bubbles ,",
    "the mean distance between neighboring sphalerons on the same bubble is @xmath91 .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate is chosen over a range that gives @xmath92 bubbles in the simulation .",
    "the sphaleron nucleation rate is kept fixed , while the bubble nucleation rate is taken to be 30 , 40 and 50 bubbles per time step .",
    "the number of bubbles nucleated per time step for the three different nucleation rates are shown in fig .",
    "[ nbubvst ] .",
    "the error bars denote 1@xmath93 fluctuations about the mean taken over 20 runs . in fig .",
    "[ nsphvst ] we plot the number of sphalerons nucleated per time step , also including 1@xmath93 error bars .",
    "this plot is equivalent to plotting the surface area separating the true vacuum and the false vacuum as a function of time .",
    "a subtle point about the simulation is that we have nucleated bubbles within a box but then the bubbles subsequently grow beyond the box .",
    "the sphalerons are , however , nucleated only within the box at a fixed rate , rejecting those sphalerons that lie on the parts of the bubbles that are outside the box .",
    "so the magnetic field close to the boundaries of the box suffer from boundary artifacts due to the lack of sphalerons outside the box .",
    "hence it is important that the magnetic field only be calculated in a sub - box that is smaller than the original box , at least by a margin that is larger than the size of the typical magnetic structure , given by @xmath94 . in our simulations ,",
    "the box size was 144 lattice spacings and the sub - box size was 108 spacings , _",
    "i.e. _ we excluded a boundary layer of 18 lattice spacings all around the box .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ nsphvst ] , most sphalerons nucleated at @xmath95 and had @xmath96 when we stopped the simulation ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "so @xmath49 for most bubbles is less than the thickness of the excluded boundary layer .",
    "the other relevant simulation parameters are the lattice spacing , @xmath98 , and the time step , @xmath99 .    after the phase transition is complete , we know where all the sphalerons are located , their orientations , and also their sizes because we know the times at which the sphalerons exploded .",
    "we take the expansion speed of the magnetic fields produced by a sphaleron to be the speed of light .",
    "this determines the size , @xmath94 , occurring in eq .",
    "( [ bchoice ] ) for every sphaleron .",
    "then at every point on a sub - lattice we sum over the magnetic field due to every sphaleron .",
    "( this is the computationally expensive part of the code since it involves roughly @xmath100 computations . )",
    "once we know the magnetic field at each lattice site , we calculate spatial correlations by doing the volume integral in eq .",
    "( [ spacecorrelator ] ) and averaging over 20 ensembles .",

    "( [ skfrommsfirst ] ) , ( [ akfrommh ] ) finally lead to the fourier space power spectra , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    before proceeding to the numerical details and results , we summarize the electroweak and cosmological parameters .",
    "the hubble distance at the electroweak epoch is @xmath101 , while the thermal length scale is @xmath102 .",
    "the sphalerons are exploding on the inverse electroweak mass length scale which is comparable to the thermal length scale .",
    "the ejected magnetic fields produced can spread out freely until the mhd frozen - in length scale at the electroweak epoch , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the electrical conductivity of the plasma .",
    "the present baryon number density is @xmath105 and at the electroweak epoch this corresponds to @xmath106 .",
    "in fig .  [ nsphvst ] we have already shown the nucleation of sphalerons as a function of time for each of the different bubble nucleation rates .",
    "( we do not vary the sphaleron nucleation rate . )",
    "the number of sphalerons nucleated at any time is proportional to the net surface area of the bubbles .",
    "as expected , the plot shows that the surface area , and hence the sphaleron nucleation rate , grows to a maximum and then decreases .",
    "if we increase the bubble nucleation rate , the rate of growth of the surface area is larger initially , but then the turning point is at earlier times because it is determined by the merging of bubbles .    the plot of the sphaleron rate versus time in fig .",
    "[ nsphvst ] also tells us the size distribution of the expanding magnetic field distribution .",
    "in particular , lower bubble nucleation rates , as are relevant in strongly first order phase transitions , lead to a sphaleron rate that is larger at later times .",
    "( the peak in fig .",
    "[ nsphvst ] is shifted to the right . )",
    "so at some fixed late time , the sphaleron explosions have had less time to grow and there are a larger number of smaller sphaleron explosion remnants .",
    "the correlation functions should therefore be larger at small distances when the bubble nucleation rate is smaller .",
    "this feature can be seen in figs .",
    "[ mlvsr ] and [ mnvsr ] where we show the spatial correlation functions , @xmath18 and @xmath17 , versus @xmath107 . in fig .",
    "[ mhvsr ] we show the helical correlation function , @xmath41 .",
    "the peak shifts to the left for smaller bubble nucleation rates in agreement with our observation above that more sphaleron explosions occur later if the bubble nucleation rate is small and have less time to grow .",
    "the fluctuations in the correlation functions , denoted by the error bars , are quite large . to further reduce them",
    "would require increasing the sphaleron rate and would increase the computational time . at present",
    ", each monte carlo with 20 runs takes about 10 days to run .",
    "the fourier space correlation functions can be found using eqs .",
    "( [ skfrommsfirst ] ) , ( [ akfrommh ] ) and are shown in figs .",

    "[ nsphvst ] we see that most sphalerons were nucleated at @xmath95 and these would primarily be on bubbles that are also of size @xmath110 , since most bubbles are nucleated at the earliest times .",

    "our results should be viewed as providing initial conditions for subsequent evolution which will also entail mhd and cosmological effects .",
    "if the cosmological fluid is turbulent , say due to the motion of bubble walls , that too will play a role .",
    "these effects did not enter our study because the magnetic fields that are produced due to sphaleron events are on scales comparable to the inverse w - boson mass and far smaller than the scale at which the medium can be treated like a fluid .",
    "the micrscopic production , however , occurs at a high rate , since it is also the rate at which baryons are produced , and the magnetic field due to different sphalerons will subsequently spread , merge and permeate space .",
    "mhd effects will come into play on length scales that are large compared to the thermal scale . as the magnetic field expands to larger scales , but still less than the frozen - in scale , mhd effects will change the linear expansion to diffusive expansion . on yet larger scales , the magnetic field expansion enters the frozen - in regime where it can only scale with the expansion of the universe .",
    "in addition to these considerations , the evolution needs to include the helicity of the magnetic field and any turbulence that may accompany the phase transition .",
    "it is known that helicity can be responsible for an `` inverse cascade '' that transfers power to larger scales .",
    "a discussion of some of these issues in the present context may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a long term goal of our model for generation of magnetic fields , is to connect the particle physics processes during baryogenesis ( such as the phase transition ) to characteristics of the magnetic field .",
    "the hope is that eventually the observation of a primordial magnetic field may say something about particle physics at the baryogenesis scale , the nano - second universe , and perhaps also the observed astrophysical magnetic structures .",

    "<S> each sphaleron produces helical magnetic fields when it decays and the helicity of the magnetic field is conserved . </S>",
