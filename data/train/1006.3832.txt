    "@xmath9 of the landau - ginzburg model @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the above homological mirror symmetry statement can be reformulated as the following equivalence : @xmath10    from the point of view of the syz conjecture @xcite , the equivalence ( [ hms2 ] ) appears to be much more natural .",
    "this is because lagrangian torus fibers of @xmath0 equipped with flat @xmath1-connections can be transformed ( via syz transformations ) to structure sheaves of points in @xmath11 . from this",
    ", one can proceed to define the functor we need in ( [ hms2 ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "matrix factorizations are geometrically endomorphisms of holomorphic vector bundles .",
    "the syz construction tells us that holomorphic vector bundles should be mirror to lagrangian _ multi - sections_. however , the equivalence ( [ hms1 ] ) says that lagrangian torus fibers of @xmath0 equipped with flat @xmath1-connections are also corresponding to matrix factorizations of @xmath5 .",
    "apparently , this seems to be in conflict with the syz picture .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the equivalence ( [ hms1 ] ) is in fact also compatible with the syz picture .",
    "we will describe how the correspondence between lagrangian torus fibers of @xmath0 equipped with flat @xmath1-connections and matrix factorizations of @xmath5 can be explained geometrically using syz transformations .",
    "we shall consider the case when @xmath0 is either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , equipped with a toric khler structure @xmath12 , i.e. the fubini - study khler form .",

    "this explains why we need to count these holomorphic disks .",
    "in fact , according to the floer theory developed by fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite , the matrix factorization @xmath19 is expected to be mirror to the floer differential @xmath56 for the a - branes @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a flat @xmath1-connection on @xmath48 , for which we have the following formula analogous to ( [ mf ] ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the point mirror to @xmath18 .",

[ main ] the syz transformation of @xmath52 gives a matrix factorization @xmath19 of @xmath5 , which is mirror to the a - brane @xmath18 on @xmath0 .",
    "we conjecture that when @xmath41 is smoothed out , our heuristic counting will give the genuine counting of holomorphic disks .",

    "their boundaries are shown in the lower halves of figures [ + + , + - ] and [ + -,++ ] .      as we have mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it is hard to classify the holomorphic disks .",
    "however , we do believe that when @xmath41 is smoothed out to @xmath84 , definition [ defn3.1 ] would give the correct restrictions on a pair of paths @xmath231 to form the boundary of a holomorphic disk .",
    "[ conjecture ] the set of permissible pairs of paths @xmath231 given in theorem [ thm3.1 ] is in a bijective correspondence with the set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic disks @xmath269 .",
    "consequently , the value of the matrix factorization @xmath19 at a point @xmath270 , where @xmath271 and @xmath259 , coincides with the floer differential @xmath272 ( computed over @xmath273 ) for the pair of a - branes @xmath274 and @xmath57 .",
    "we are still far away from proving this conjecture .",
    "nevertheless , we shall try to give a justification of definition [ defn3.1 ] and conjecture [ conjecture ] in the following .",
    "first of all , recall that the image of @xmath41 consists of overlapping @xmath275-fibrations ( over the line segments @xmath176\\times\\{t/3\\}$ ] and @xmath177 $ ] ) and zero sections ( over @xmath42 ) . hence",
    ", if @xmath276 is a certain smoothing of @xmath41 as described in the above conjecture , then we expect that some parts of a holomorphic disk @xmath277 would be squeezed into a line segment when @xmath276 degenerates to @xmath41 .",
    "this is why we allow the boundary of a disk with zero area , realized as a pair of line segments with opposite orientations , to be a component of a permissible pair .",
    "this also explains why @xmath232 can be a constant path .",
    "second , as @xmath41 is being smoothed out to give @xmath84 , we assume that the intersection points @xmath191 are moving away from each other and their relative positions are as shown in the left hand side of figure [ p , q ] .",
    "hence , we need to impose condition 1 in definition [ defn3.1 ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath41 is a union of lagrangian strata , a holomorphic disk @xmath105 is at best piecewise smooth .",
    "so we assume that @xmath234 is piecewise smooth in condition 2 of definition [ defn3.1 ] . that we require that it is piecewise linear is because , as shown in the @xmath3 case , the boundary of a holomorphic disk is linear and goes in some specific directions .",
    "now , since we expect that a holomorphic disk @xmath105 is piecewise smooth , it is natural to break such a disk into several components , each is bounded by a stratum of @xmath41 ( and sometimes together with @xmath48 ) .",
    "if the stratum is the copy of @xmath15 , then the only natural candidates are the three maslov index two disks with boundary in @xmath15 ; and in view of the balancing condition ( condition 4 ) discussed below , we expect that only the disk with nontrivial intersection with the line at infinity will occur .",
    "so we impose condition 3(iii ) .",
    "when the stratum is the 4 copies of the zero section , we expect that a disk component would be contained in either @xmath211 or @xmath212 . and as such , they should be classified in the same way as the @xmath3 case shown in figure [ discs ] .",
    "moreover , a disk of the form @xmath118 would not occur since it is of maslov index 4 as a disk in @xmath4 .",
    "this explains condition 3(i ) .",
    "if the stratum is one of the @xmath175-fibrations , then we expect that there is no nontrivial disk whose boundary is contained entirely in this stratum .",
    "this is because the @xmath275 s can either bound a cylinder , in which case the other boundary must lie in @xmath48 , or a disk with maslov index 4 which should not be counted anyway .",
    "therefore , the only possibility is a disk with zero area , or a pair of line segments with opposite orientations .",
    "this explains part of the reason why we impose condition 3(ii ) .",
    "( 100,40 ) ( 50,3)(-1,0)10 ( 50,3)(1,0)10 ( 49,-1)@xmath278 ( 38,2)@xmath181 ( 31,1.5)@xmath202 ( 60,2)@xmath181 ( 62,1.5)@xmath203 ( 38,36)@xmath181 ( 31,36.5)@xmath201 ( 60,36)@xmath181 ( 62,36.5)@xmath200 ( 39,20)(0,-1)16 ( 39,20)(0,1)16 ( 37,18)@xmath279    here comes a subtle point , namely , why we allow just one of the @xmath175-fibrations in @xmath41 , but not both ?",
    "the reason is that when @xmath41 is being smoothed out and the intersection points @xmath233 are moving away from each other , we expect that there is a choice of the relative moving speeds of the points .",
    "for example , by imposing condition 3(ii ) of definition [ defn3.1 ] in the way we did , we have implicitly chosen the smoothing so that the distance between @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( or @xmath203 and @xmath202 ) is of the order @xmath280 , while the distance between @xmath200 and @xmath203 ( or @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) is of the order @xmath281 .",
    "see figure [ epsilon ] for an illustration .",
    "intuitively , this choice means that a pair of line segments contained in the regions @xmath282 ( or @xmath283 ) would bound a holomorphic disk only when they are vertical , but not horizontal .",
    "this explains why we have condition 3(ii ) .",
    "if we instead choose the smoothing so that the distance between @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( or @xmath203 and @xmath202 ) is of the order @xmath281 , and the distance between @xmath200 and @xmath203 ( or @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) is of the order @xmath280 , then we would be allowing only pairs of horizontal , but not vertical , line segments in @xmath282 ( or @xmath283 ) to bound a disk . in this case , for example , the following @xmath234 ( figure [ notpermissible ] ) is allowed , but not the one shown in the lower half of figure [ + + , + - ] .        finally , we come to the balancing condition ( condition 4 ) , which is another key condition in the definition of a permissible pair of paths . in general , when we try to deform a singular holomorphic disk into a smooth holomorphic disk , there are some necessary conditions ( or integrability conditions ) . in our situation , we expect that we should have the following condition : for three disk components whose moment map images lie in three directions , say @xmath284 , the union is smoothable if @xmath285 .",
    "this is based on the following fact : suppose that @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 are gradient flow line segments of three functions @xmath289 , @xmath290 and @xmath291 on @xmath292 respectively , and they form a tree @xmath293 with a 3-valent vertex .",
    "let @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 be the lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath297 given by the graphs of the exact 1-forms @xmath298 , @xmath299 and @xmath300 respectively",
    ". then the tree can be deformed to a holomorphic disk bounded by the lagrangians @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 if and only if @xmath301 ( see e.g. fukaya - oh @xcite ) .",
    "now , the moment map image of a disk component allowed by condition 3(i ) lies in either the @xmath208 or @xmath209 directions and that of condition 3(ii ) lies in the @xmath209 direction .",
    "hence , to get it balanced , we must have a disk whose moment map image lies in the direction @xmath302 .",
    "this is why we set condition 3(iii ) .",
    "moreover , a holomorphic disk @xmath105 should then have either one component or three components .",
    "this explains why we have condition 4 in definition [ defn3.1 ] .",
    "this concludes our heuristic reasoning and justification for definition [ defn3.1 ] and conjecture [ conjecture ] .",
    "as we mention before , to make this informal argument into a real proof , we will ( at least ) need some sort of gluing theorems , which are not available at the moment .",
    "we expect that we can play the same game and extend theorem [ main ] to other toric del pezzo surfaces , and even higher dimensional toric fano manifolds .",
    "in particular , by essentially the same constructions and arguments , we can deal with the blowups of @xmath4 at one and two points .",
    "we leave this as an exercise to the reader .",
    "however , for the blowup of @xmath4 at three points , things become more subtle . indeed",
    ", we can not get the correct matrix factorization by directly applying the constructions in this paper .",
    "we do not know why this is so , but it is possibly related to the smoothability of the deformed lagrangian subspace @xmath41 .    to deal with this case and hence obtain a unified treatment for all toric del pezzo surfaces , we would need to choose a better deformed lagrangian subspace @xmath41 and try to classify the holomorphic disks .",
