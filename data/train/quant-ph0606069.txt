    "simply stated , a rydberg molecule is composed of a highly excited electron orbiting around a compact ionic molecular core , containing the nuclei and the tightly bound other electrons .",
    "most of the time , the outer electron is very far from the core .",
    "it is spatially well - separated from it , and the core and electron dynamics are uncoupled , the core s dynamics being characterized by its rotational energy .",
    "however , the outer electron periodically scatters on the molecular core . in quantum - mechanical terms",
    "the electron and core dynamics get coupled and the collision induces phase - shifts in the wavefunction of the outer electron , known as quantum defects @xcite .",
    "this process has a well - defined classical counterpart @xcite : the electron is kicked by the core , resulting in a change of the electron s angular momentum relative to the core by an angle which depends on the quantum defects . during the kick the core and the outer electron may exchange energy , so that in general the rotational state of the core has changed after the collision .",
    "although a molecule is intrinsically a quantum object , several properties , such as the stroboscopic effect seen in laser excitation or the statistics of the energy levels have been shown to depend on the underlying classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "there is however a distinctive quantum feature that has no classical counterpart , which is readily touched upon by observing that a typical molecular state is described by quantum mechanics as a superposition of the different core states available to the molecule , each state being associated with the corresponding outer electron .",
    "this superposition is the result of the electron - core entanglement produced by the collision .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the entanglement dynamics and in particular its dependence on the underlying classical regime .",
    "indeed there has been a growing interest in recent years to correlate the entanglement production of a quantum system with the dynamics of the corresponding classical system .",
    "for example the time - dependent entanglement production was investigated on the @xmath0 atom jaynes - cummings model ( a single mode field interacting with a 2-level spin ) , where the initial product - state wave - packet was chosen to lie in different regions of classical phase - space @xcite .",
    "similar studies were undertaken for kicked tops @xcite .",
    "the initial claims @xcite by which entanglement would systematically increase with chaos were revised in subsequent works .",
    "one of the problems was to unequivocally define the classical counterpart for such systems , which is far from being straightforward for the spin - boson case and has been discussed for the coupled kicks system . a semiclassical approach @xcite based on the average properties of phase - space concluded that both the coupling strength ( in the form of classical correlators ) and the global classical dynamical regime were important in understanding the entanglement rate .",
    "however the relevance of universal relations relating the generation of entanglement to the dynamics of the corresponding classical system are still being debated : the form of the initial quantum state is known to play a role @xcite , and from a more general viewpoint realistic systems usually display more complex dynamics than simple systems that present a uniform behavior over all points of phase - space . in this respect the choice of rydberg molecules to investigate entanglement generation may be fruitful : these real systems are theoretically well described ( by quantum defect theory ) , the semiclassical limit is readily obtained , and the classical dynamics is sufficiently simple to be well understood ( at least qualitatively ) without being too simplistic .    this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly recall some basics concerning the quantum theory of simple rydberg molecules and describe the classical counterpart of such systems , insisting on the relevant poincar surfaces of section . in sec .",
    "iii we determine the degree of the electron - core entanglement , inferred from the linear entropy of the reduced density matrix for the outer electron .",
    "we will calculate some simple statistics on groups of eigenstates corresponding to different classical regimes .",
    "we will then follow the time - evolution of the entanglement from an initially unentangled product state .",
    "this will be done for different initial states and various dynamical regimes .",
    "the results will be discussed in sec .",
    "we will see that the classical dynamics is reflected in the entanglement generation ; but the global dynamical regime is less important than the specific classical effects that are quantum mechanically translated into superpositions .",
    "our closing comments will be given in sec .",
    "a rydberg molecule is composed of two elements : a highly excited electron  the rydberg electron , on the one hand , and the ionic molecular core , positively charged , containing the nuclei and the tightly bound other electrons on the other hand .",
    "the rydberg electron is usually far from the core and only senses the long - range coulomb field produced by the core , irrespective of the complex interactions involving the core particles .",
    "the total energy of the molecule @xmath1 is consequently partitioned between the energies of the core and of the rydberg electron .    for definiteness",
    ", we will take a diatomic molecule for which vibration can be neglected : rotation is then the only motion available to the core .",
    "since the molecule is isolated , the total angular momentum @xmath2 and its projection @xmath3 on an axis fixed in the laboratory are conserved .",
    "we have @xmath4i.e .",
    "@xmath5 results from the addition of the angular momenta of the core , @xmath6 and of the rydberg electron @xmath7 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath8 is conserved , as is often the case , and the standard addition of angular momenta gives @xmath9each state of the core is therefore labeled by @xmath10 .",
    "recall that it also follows from the addition of angular momenta that whereas @xmath0 and @xmath8 are well - defined , their projections @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the reference axis are not , since only the total projection @xmath13 is well - defined .",
    "therefore the notation @xmath14 also contains the angular state of the rydberg electron , via the geometrical angular momenta couplings .",
    "as is well known , the energy of the core @xmath15 depends on @xmath0 through a rotational constant @xmath16,@xmath17and the total energy of the molecule is thus@xmath18where @xmath19 is the energy and @xmath20 the effective quantum number of the rydberg electron,@xmath21(atomic units are used throughout ) .",
    "note that for a given value of @xmath1 , @xmath22 implicitly depends on the state of the core : the electron is more or less excited depending on whether the core has a large or small rotation number @xmath0 . here",
    "we will only deal with bound states ( i.e. , @xmath1 is below the lowest ionization threshold ) .",
    "the wavefunction corresponding to the rydberg electron in the coulomb field of a core in the rotational state @xmath14 is thus@xmath23@xmath24 being the radial coordinate and @xmath25 the coulomb function regular at the origin .",
    "now when the electron significantly approaches the core , the interaction between the core particles and the electron can not be neglected .",
    "these interactions are embodied in the short - range potential @xmath26 , that is negligible beyond the core radius @xmath27 .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian of the molecule is @xmath28with the functions @xmath29 being eigenstates of @xmath30 . from scattering theory , it is well - known that the wavefunctions for @xmath31 are obtained from    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the coulomb function irregular at the origin and @xmath34 is the scattering matrix ; @xmath35 gives the transition probability amplitude between states @xmath29 and @xmath36 during the collision .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the total hamiltonian @xmath31 are obtained by the superposition @xmath37the coefficients @xmath38 are obtained from quantum defect theory @xcite by imposing the appropriate boundary conditions at infinity , yielding also the discrete eigenvalues @xmath1 .",
    "we thus see from eqs .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e19 ] ) that a generic wavefunction for a molecular rydberg state involves a superposition of core states with different rotational numbers .",
    "this is caused by the short - range potential @xmath26 that transforms the _ product state _ @xmath29 [ eq .  ( [ e14 ] ) ] into the _ entangled state _ @xmath39 . in practical computations ,",
    "( [ e19 ] ) is of awkward use because taken individually each of the functions @xmath40 diverges radially .",
    "( [ e19 ] ) is therefore rewritten as@xmath41where the @xmath42 are the effective channel functions,@xmath43which by construction converge as @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is precisely the total phase accumulated at @xmath44 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath46 are obtained from the @xmath47 by matching eqs .",
    "( [ e19 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) .",
    "an additional subtlety arises from the use of frame transformations : the wavefunctions given above were described in the laboratory frame .",
    "however when the electron collides on the core , a description in the molecular frame , attached to the core rotation , is more appropriate , because in the core region the rydberg electron senses the cylindrical field aligned along the molecular axis .",
    "thus only the projection of @xmath7 on that axis , traditionally denoted by @xmath48 , matters when describing the collision : the phase - shifts induced by the collision on the rydberg electron s wavefunction are known as quantum defects and denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the collision matrix @xmath34 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) is obtained by expressing the phase - shifts @xmath49 in the laboratory frame @xcite .",
    "and its angular momentum @xmath50 is along @xmath51,width=192 ]      the classical counterpart of the quantum model introduced above is the following @xcite . when the rydberg electron is far from the core , it follows a pure coulomb ( kepler ) orbit with an angular momentum @xmath52 fixed in space .",
    "meanwhile the molecular core rotates freely with a rotational energy @xmath53 depending on the core s angular momentum @xmath0 and moment of inertia @xmath54 .",
    "seen in the molecular frame , @xmath7 precesses around @xmath50 , i.e. it turns around the @xmath50 axis with a constant angle ( see fig .  [ figframe ] ) .",
    "now when the outer electron approaches the core , it gets kicked by the molecular axis .",
    "this kick results in a change in the direction of @xmath55 @xmath50 adjusts accordingly , since the total angular momentum @xmath5 is conserved . to visualize the effects of the kick ,",
    "it is therefore sufficient to follow the evolution of @xmath7 in the molecular frame .    since during the collision the rydberg electron feels the cylindrical field due to the molecular axis ,",
    "@xmath56 can not change and thus only the angle @xmath57 varies ( see fig .",
    "[ figframe ] ) .",
    "this variation , denoted @xmath58 , is the deflection angle of the plane of the classical kepler orbit .",
    "the relation between the classical deflection angle and the quantum scattering phase - shifts is well known from the semiclassical approximation to the scattering amplitude @xcite . here",
    "it takes the form @xmath59i.e .",
    "the strength of the kick , reflected in the amplitude of the deflection angle , is the classical counterpart of the dependence of the phase - shifts on @xmath60 .",
    "the precise form of this dependence depends on the particular molecule at hand .",
    "however , for a typical molecule , the dependence can be taken in the form@xmath61classically the coupling parameter @xmath62 gives the strength of the kick since it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ e21 ] ) and ( [ e23 ] ) that@xmath63     ( b ) large coupling @xmath64 ( in the generic case , see fig .",

    "the shaded areas correspond to quantum states with minimal ( @xmath65 ) , and mean ( @xmath66 ) values of @xmath0 ( see sec .",
    "their widths correspond to @xmath67 .",
    "the mean @xmath68 case is not on the equatorial @xmath69 plane , as can be understood by squaring @xmath70 ( where @xmath50 is `` horizontal '' , parallel to @xmath51 ) when the lengths of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are equal . ]    to visualize the classical dynamics , a poincar surface of section is obtained by plotting the position of @xmath7 after each kick .",
    "this is most naturally done in the molecular frame where the position of @xmath7 is given by the polar angles @xmath71 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figframe ] , with @xmath72 being canonically conjugate to @xmath73 .",
    "this is the molecular reference frame used in quantum mechanics .",
    "however , as in our previous works @xcite , we prefer to add an extra rotation around @xmath74 to bring the @xmath51 axis along @xmath50 .",
    "this last rotation is not canonical but the classical motion is seen more naturally in this frame ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "the position of @xmath7 is thus plotted after each kick , when the electron comes out of the core . of course , since @xmath75 is conserved , following the position of @xmath7 is tantamount to knowing the fate of @xmath50 .",
    "two extreme examples of poincar sections are given in fig .",
    "[ figpss0max ] . in the first case ,",
    "[ figpss0max](a ) , the positions of @xmath7 follow circles around @xmath50 ( the @xmath76 axis ) giving an overall regular surface of section .",
    "this means that on a given circle @xmath7 is fixed in space , as is always @xmath5 , and thus that @xmath77 is constant . in the second case ,",
    "[ figpss0max](b ) , the surface of section is clearly characteristic of a chaotic phase space and no structure arises by following the successive positions of @xmath7 after each kick .",
    "generically , in a rydberg molecule the core and the outer electron are entangled ; in the situation examined in this work , the core is in a superposition of different rotational states .",
    "each rotational state is defined by a given value of @xmath0 , and to each core state is associated an outer electron with an energy @xmath78 given by eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "hence the outer electron is in a superposition of different channels which are distinguished in the present model by a different energy , depending on @xmath0 .",
    "classically of course there is no superposition in @xmath0 : the rotational energy of the core , and thus the energy of the outer electron , is at each instant unique and well defined . a change in @xmath0",
    "can only be the dynamical result of an inelastic kick .",
    "note that classically as well as quantum mechanically , the angular momenta @xmath7 and @xmath50 are coupled , since @xmath5 is conserved . as is well - known , the composition of angular momenta in quantum mechanics results in couplings due to the fact the projections of the angular momenta vectors can not be simultaneously defined .",
    "this entanglement of geometrical nature ( as in epr pairs ) should not be confused with the dynamical entanglement generated by the potential interaction between the outer electron and the core .",
    "geometrical entanglements due to angular momenta coupling do not play any role in this work , as we are only interested in the dynamical one which only depends on @xmath79 .",
    "this implies that a product state is given by the channel functions @xmath80 defined by eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) , i.e. only the _ radial _ coordinate of the outer electron is separable from the core whereas its orbital angular momentum is necessarily geometrically coupled to the core s angular momentum @xmath50 ( since @xmath5 is conserved and @xmath30 has spherical symmetry ) .",
    "hence when referring to partial traces on the outer electron we will mean a trace over its sole radial coordinate and conversely a partial trace over the core includes tracing over the angular coordinates of the electron .    to quantify entanglement we will determine the linear entropy @xmath81 associated with the reduced density matrix @xmath82 descibing the outer electron , @xmath83where @xmath84 is the density matrix of the system and @xmath85 ( resp .",
    "@xmath86 ) refers to averaging over the core ( resp .",
    "outer electron ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduced linear entropy is then defined by@xmath87strictly speaking , @xmath81 measures the degree of mixedness : @xmath81 vanishes for a pure state and is maximum for a uniformly mixed state .",
    "however when @xmath81 is associated with improper mixtures in bipartite systems , it reflects the degree of entanglement @xcite and the linear entropy or equivalent quantities such as the purity have routinely been employed as such .",
    "we will undertake two different studies .",
    "first we will investigate the degree of entanglement on stationary states and its dependence on the collision phase - shifts , whose classical counterpart gives rise to different dynamical regimes .",
    "this involves the computation of simple statistics of @xmath88 in an energy range for which the classical dynamics does not vary .",
    "we will then investigate the time evolution @xmath89 from an initially ( at @xmath90 ) product state .",
    "this involves the determination of wavepacket dynamics .",
    "the initial wavepacket can be made to lie and then evolve in zones corresponding to different classical dynamics .",
    "we will obtain numerical results for the following choice of parameters : @xmath91 @xmath92 yielding by eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) 21 values for @xmath0 .",
    "since kronig s parity , i.e. parity by reflection at a plane through the internuclear axis @xmath74 ( which for fixed @xmath8 and @xmath2 depends on the parity of @xmath0 ) , is conserved , entanglement only takes place between states of the same kronig s parity .",
    "states of @xmath93 and @xmath94 kronig s parity , called positive and negative states in standard spectroscopic notation @xcite , behave in the same way , and we will restrict our study to @xmath93 parity states ; then @xmath0 can only take even values , so that a typical state contains superpositions involving up to @xmath95 values of @xmath0 .",
    "these angular momenta numbers are considerably higher than for typical diatomic molecules ( they would better correspond to models of large molecular compound rydberg states ) .",
    "however higher quantum numbers allow a finer comparison between quantum and classical dynamics , without qualitatively affecting the correspondence between them : see @xcite , where partial results with angular quantum numbers typical of diatomic molecules such as na@xmath96 were obtained . and",

    "when the initial state encircles the @xmath76 axis at the front of the sphere as happens with @xmath156 ( see the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ figpss0max ] ) , it will be hardly modified by the classical dynamics . the lines in the surface of section ( fig .",
    "[ figpss](d ) ) also encircle the @xmath76 axis , thereby conserving @xmath145 : there is essentially only elastic scattering .",
    "quantum mechanically we expect little or no entanglement , as is observed in fig .",
    "[ short - time-1 ] .",
    "but for @xmath152 the initial distribution spans across the lines of regularity in the surface of section , which are organized around the elliptic fixed point on the @xmath106 axis .",
    "these lines thus define torii in phase - space that cut across several values of @xmath0 , meaning inelastic scattering and quantum - mechanical superpositions .",
    "note that in the generic @xmath107 situation the linear entropy is lower than in the resonant case ; classically the structure of phase space in the zone covered by the initial state is modified due to the appearance of resonant islands ( fig .",
    "[ figpss](a ) ) , leading to some lines that roughly encircle the @xmath76 axis , partially favoring elastic scattering .",
    "we thus see that the entanglement production reflects the classical dynamics in that the relevant parts of space - phase leading to inelastic collisions ( yielding quantum superpositions ) are explored with a large amplitude . to a large extent",
    "this phenomenon is unrelated to whether the dynamical regime is chaotic or regular .",
    "classical chaos is not necessary to induce high entanglement generation . in our system chaos",
    "is sufficient , because it always leads to inelastic scattering .",
    "hence eigenstates quantized in an underlying strongly chaotic phase - space will present on average a large amount of mixtures , as seen in fig .",
    "these remarks are in line with similar conclusions @xcite which contrarily to earlier results @xcite , do not attribute to chaos a higher entangling power .",
    "let us mention that more precise investigations of the correlations between classical dynamics and dynamically induced entanglement should take into account more information than what can be inferred from the poincar surfaces of sections .",
    "for example in the generic @xmath108 case ( fig .",
    "[ figpss](b ) ) diffusion in the chaotic sea takes place at a considerably lower rate than in the @xmath64 situation . in particular ,",
    "the particle may be trapped for several periods in certain regions of phase - space , diffusing slowly in the relevant regions of the surface of section .",
    "this type of phenomena has an influence on the quantization process , and if important will influence the entanglement production , as in the present case .",
    "we therefore expect that these system specific features , along with the rle of the initial state relative to the precise structure of phase - space , may severely constrain the applicability to realistic systems of general universal formulas ruling the entanglement generation in chaotic and regular systems that have been recently obtained @xcite .",
    "semiclassical universal formulas , based on the global average properties of classical phase - space , are important as they set the trend that is followed by a quantum system with simple dynamics ( like a uniform transition to chaos )",
    ". however individual features of the system are known to be important in the semiclassical description of diffractive effects induced by a coupling potential and need to be taken into account e.g. to describe the spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "it is thus not surprising to see that dynamical entanglement induced by a standard potential coupling is correlated with the local structure of phase - space , and not only with its global properties .",
    "concerning the long - time behavior , it may be noted that the revivals appear well beyond the heisenberg time , time after which quantum phenomena having no classical counterpart become prominent . in some cases",
    ", for example when the number of channels is small , the oscillations due to wavepacket revivals induce very large variations of the entanglement rate totally unrelated to the behavior at short - times .",
    "hence the linear entropy of a state which initially only showed a slow and small amount of entanglement generation can rise above the linear entropy of a state that initially displayed high and fast entanglement production .",
    "we finally point out that entanglement in rydberg molecules is routinely detected experimentally , given that the consequences of entanglement appear in even the most elementary measurements ( e.g. interference of rydberg series in photoabsorption spectra ) . a quantitative measurement of entanglement",
    ", that would more closely reflect the evolution of the linear entropy , can be set up by combining the methods employed for the detection of interfering rydberg wavepackets @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on the use of several laser pulses with well - defined phase relations to monitor the interferences appearing in the population of predefined rydberg states .",
    "we have investigated the entanglement production in rydberg molecules and contrasted the results with the underlying classical dynamics , which is known to play a rle in the understanding of observable spectroscopic effects @xcite and in the interpretation of the energy levels statistics @xcite .",
    "we have first determined the average linear entropy of eigenstates corresponding to different collision strengths ( quantum phase shifts or classical kicks ) and then studied the generation of entanglement from initially unentangled states .",
    "we have seen that the quantum / classical correspondence on the level of entanglement production is relevant not on the scale of the global classical dynamical regime , but rather on the specific classical features that quantum - mechanically translate into superpositions . in rydberg molecules , it is a high rate of inelastic scattering for an initial classical distribution that corresponds in the quantum domain to states displaying a high degree of entanglement .",
    "the relation between global chaotic or regular behavior on the one hand and these specific classical features that will be translated quantum mechanically as entanglement production on the other hand appears to highly depend on the individual system under investigation . we therefore conclude",
    "it seems unlikely that the generation of entanglement could be employed as a reliable signature of chaos for an arbitrary dynamical system ."
