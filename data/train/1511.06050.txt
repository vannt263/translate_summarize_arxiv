    "the mixed graphs are also called _ partially directed graphs_. bosk @xcite investigated those mixed graphs with given degree and given diameter having maximum number of vertices which are called mixed moore graphs . in some sense , bosk generalized the concepts of moore graph and moore digraph by allowing the existence of both edges and arcs simultaneously .",
    "these graphs and digraphs have been very used to model different kind of networks ( such as a telecommunications , multiprocessor , or local area network , to name just a few ) . in many real - world networks",
    "a mixture of both unidirectional and bidirectional connections may exist ( e.g. the world wide web network , where pages are nodes and hyperlinks describe the connections ) .",
    "for such networks , mixed graphs provide a perfect modeling framework @xcite .",

    "apart from @xmath23 @xmath24 , moore graphs exist only when @xmath25 ( petersen graph ) , @xmath26 ( the hoffman - singleton graph ) and possibly @xmath27 .",
    "for more details and results concerning moore graphs see the survey by miller and ir @xcite .    directed moore graphs ( mixed moore graphs admitting only arcs ) with maximum out - degree @xmath11 and diameter @xmath12 are digraphs of order @xmath28 ( directed moore bound ) . in @xcite it was proved that the moore digraphs do not exist for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "moore graphs are special cases of mixed moore graphs where the graphs admit only arcs or only edges , respectively @xcite .",
    "a mixed graph is said to be _ proper _ if it contains at least one arc and at least one edge .",
    "in particular , a _ mixed regular graph _ is a simple and finite graph @xmath34 where each vertex @xmath35 of @xmath34 is incident with @xmath36 arcs from it and @xmath37 edges ; @xmath36 is the directed degree and @xmath37 is the undirected degree of @xmath35 and we set @xmath38 , @xmath11 being the degree of @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath34 has diameter equal to @xmath12 , we say that @xmath34 is a @xmath39-mixed graph of directed degree @xmath36 , undirected degree @xmath37 and diameter @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the upper bound on the order of a @xmath41-mixed graph .",
    "a mixed graph that attains this bound is called a @xmath41-mixed moore graph of diameter @xmath12 .",

    "the following conjecture was proposed by bosk in 1979 ( see @xcite ) and proved in 2007 by nguyen , miller and gimbert ( see @xcite ) .",

    "hence , mixed moore graphs different from cycles have diameter @xmath22 and their order attains the following upper bound : @xmath49    bosk in @xcite gives for @xmath22 divisibility conditions for the existence of mixed moore graphs related with the distribution of undirected and directed edges .",
    "he proved that the two parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 must satisfy a tight arithmetic condition . accordingly , apart from the trivial cases when @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( graph @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( graph @xmath23 ) , there must exists a positive odd integer @xmath55 such that @xmath56 in the same paper bosk provides constructions of some of these mixed moore graphs with all of them being , except the bosk graph of order @xmath57 , isomorphic to kautz digraphs @xmath58 with all digons ( cycles of length 2 ) considered as undirected edges ( see @xcite ) .    in 2007 nguyen , miller and gimbert ( see @xcite ) proved that all mixed moore graphs of diameter 2 known at that time were unique .",
    "however , this is not generally true since jorgensen recently found ( see @xcite ) two non - isomorphic mixed moore graphs of diameter 2 , out - degree 7 , undirected degree 3 and order 108 .",
    "table [ all ] depicts all values for @xmath59 with the corresponding feasible values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , such that a mixed moore graph either exists or is not known to exist .",
    "there are still many values of @xmath37 and @xmath36 for which the existence of a mixed moore graph of diameter 2 has not been settled .",
    "in both the undirected and directed graphs most of the work carried out on this topic has focused on constructing ( di)-graphs of diameter @xmath60 , degree @xmath14 and a number or vertices as close as possible to the respective moore bounds .",
    "based on this , we say that a mixed moore graph is _ dense _ if its order is close to the moore bound and it is _ optimal _ , if there does not exist a mixed graph with the same parameters and bigger order .    in this paper we give a construction of mixed graphs of diameter @xmath10 ,",
