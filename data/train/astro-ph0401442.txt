    "in recent years it has become evident that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) could play a crucial role in the formation of most galaxies .",
    "although only a small fraction of galaxies at any one time contain an agn , it is possible that all sufficiently massive galaxies passed through an active phase at some point in their history .",
    "answering the question of what triggers this activity is a vital step in gaining a full understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "recent observations that most nearby luminous galaxies contain a massive black hole ( or at least a massive dark object ) certainly support the hypothesis that these galaxies all passed through an agn phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular @xcite suggest that all dynamically hot systems ( either elliptical galaxies or spiral bulges ) will contain a central massive dark object .",
    "the measured masses of these dark objects are found to be correlated to the luminosity ( or mass , assuming a uniform mass - to - light ratio ) of the spheroidal component , with more massive spheroids containing more massive dark objects .",
    "detailed analysis has shown that black hole mass appears to correlate most tightly with the velocity dispersion of the spheroid @xcite .",
    "this relation also appears to hold in galaxies with current nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "further circumstantial evidence of a connection between agn and galaxy formation is that the strong increase in the space density of luminous qsos with increasing redshift @xcite closely matches the increase in the the global star formation rate @xcite .",
    "both of these appear to peak at @xmath10 .",
    "parameters such as the shape , size and luminosity of agn host galaxies can help to determine how the activity occurs , and also shed light on the process of galaxy formation .",
    "the first observations of agn host galaxies focused on low redshift sources , limited as they were by the moderate resolution of most ground based facilities .",
    "it has been know for some time that radio - loud ( rl ) sources are exclusively found in elliptical galaxies while low - luminosity radio - quiet ( rq ) seyfert galaxies were thought to prefer spiral galaxies .",
    "however , more recently @xcite found that almost half of the rq agn in their sample had early - type hosts",
    ".    the high resolution available with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has provided significant advances in the measurement of agn host galaxies . at low redshift ( @xmath11 ) @xcite have imaged the hosts of 76 agn selected from the einstein extended medium sensitivity survey .",
    "these should be free of any selection bias with respect to host properties , and lie in a luminosity range bracketing the extrapolated break in the agn luminosity function , @xmath12 . in this sample of rq",
    "agn 55% had hosts which were dominated by a spheroidal component .",
    "apart from this bias towards earlier morphological types , in all other respects the host galaxies are identical to normal galaxies .",
    "for example , they follow the same size - luminosity relations for disks and spheroids as normal galaxies . for brighter low - redshift agn",
    "the hosts are invariably elliptical galaxies @xcite .    at higher redshift ,",
    "the most systematic and extensive work so far has been by @xcite , who have observed rq and rl agn with @xmath13 at @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the rest - frame v - band using nicmos on the hst . at @xmath14",
    "they find hosts which are consistent with the passive evolution of elliptical galaxies . at higher redshift ( @xmath0 ) it appears that the rq agn have hosts which are are somewhat fainter than a passively evolving model , while the rl agn hosts are still consistent with passively evolved elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , although they made detections of hosts at @xmath15 , kukula et al . struggled to fit both size and luminosity for their @xmath15 rq sample , as they where faint and compact ( similar in size to the nicmos psf in the @xmath16-band ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to make a detailed investigation of the host galaxy properties of agn at @xmath0 , near the peak in both agn and cosmic star - formation activity .",
    "our approach has been to select agn for study that are near to @xmath1 in luminosity .",
    "this therefore allows us to examine the hosts of _ typical _ agn at high redshift . in order to obtain sufficient signal - to - noise ( @xmath17 ) and spatial resolution",
    "we have used the infrared adaptive optics ( ao ) system , hokupaa , at gemini north to carry out an imaging survey of high redshift agn hosts . at @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath18 agn typically have apparent magnitudes of @xmath19 .",
    "this is too faint to be used as an ao guide star .",
    "therefore we have used the large database of the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ; croom et al .",
    "2001 ; croom et al .",

    "these observations were made in order for us to better characterize the expected psf of our qso targets , and hence to make more accurate model fits to determine the host galaxy contribution to the source flux .      before analysing the qsos , we require a detailed characterization of the psf .",
    "a central part of the problem of detecting and measuring host galaxies around these agn is understanding the psf .",
    "the challenges of modelling the psf are severe with ao systems .",
    "the psf is expected to change as a function of distance from the ao guide star .",
    "increasing distance from the guide star degrades the resolution , and some elongation is expected , with the major axis being directed towards the location of the guide star .",
    "variations will also be expected , depending on the brightness of the ao guide star , and the uncorrected seeing .",
    "our observations were designed to enable us to quantify these effects .",
    "preliminary investigations showed that moffat profiles provided a significantly better fit to the psfs than did gaussians .",
    "therefore , in our analysis below , we will use moffat profiles of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the intensity at a given pixel , a distance @xmath21 from the center of the source , @xmath61 is the central intensity of the source , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are parameters which define the shape of the profile .",
    "@xmath63 is typically @xmath64 for our images .",
    "we will also discuss the fwhm of the images , which for a moffat profile is defined as @xmath65 we also investigated whether there was any evidence of a core - halo structure in our psfs .",
    "even when stacking multiple psfs we found no evidence of an extended halo around the compact core of the psf .",
    "this is most likely attributable to the relatively low strehl ratios ( @xmath66 ) in our observations .    in all cases",

    "these secondary psfs provide an estimate of the spatial variation of the psf with distance from the guide star . in the case that no secondary psf stars were available in the ao - corrected field a star - star pair was observed to quantify the spatial variation of the psf .",
    "one of the stars served as the ao guide star and primary psf and the second served as the secondary psf .",
    "our 8 psf star observations had a median separation of 12.6 arcseconds ( range 11.1 to 13.3 arcseconds ) , and the 5 star - star pairs found on the science images had separations from 6.0 to 14.5 arcseconds with a median of 10.6 arcseconds .",
    "for comparison , the separations from the ao guide star to the science targets ranged from 9.9 to 13.0 arcseconds with a median of 10.7 arcseconds .",
    "the `` delivered '' resolution of the aligned and stacked psf images ranged from 0.11 to 0.24 arcseconds with a median value of 0.15 arcseconds .",
    "this is similar to the distribution of science image delivered resolutions .",
    "the fundamental measurements that provide a basic characterization of the psf are the fwhm of the profile , the ellipticity , and the position angle ( pa ) .",
    "these were derived by fitting a moffat profile to the two - dimensional image using the iraf imexamine task .",
    "the `` direct '' fwhm was adopted .",
    "[ fig : psf ] is a comparison of the parameters of all of the star - star pairs in our observations both from those science frames that had secondary psfs and from the star - star pairs that we observed .",
    "we first directly compare the pa , ellipticity and fwhm of the guide stars and the psf stars in figs .",
    "[ fig : psf]a , b and c. we see that the ao guide stars and psf stars generally have the same pas and ellipticity , with no evidence of systematic changes in orientation or ellipticity seen for the psf stars . as in all cases",
    "the sources are close to circular , the error on the pa is large . in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf]c we show the fwhm of the psf stars vs. that of the ao guide stars .",
    "we see that the psf stars generally have a slightly wider fwhm than the ao guide stars , which is as expected given that the psf stars are off axis .",
    "we next show the quantity @xmath67pa in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf]d .",
    "this is the absolute value of the difference between the pa of the model fit to the secondary psf star and angle of a line from the secondary psf to the ao guide star .",
    "we plot this against the difference in ellipticity between the ao guide star and the psf star .",
    "if the psf star was elongated with its major axis pointing toward the guide star then these angles should cluster around zero , that is , the major axis should tend to point toward the guide star .",

    "if the psf star was elongated then this should tend to be a positive quantity .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "we therefore fail to detect any elongation of the psf stars , in the direction of the ao guide star , or any other direction .    figs . [ fig : psf]e and f show the difference between the fwhm of the psf star and the ao guide star ( @xmath67fwhm=(fwhm(psf)-fwhm(gs ) ) ) .",
    "a positive value indicates that the resolution of the psf star is degraded relative to the guide star .",
    "the expected degradation is detected and ranges from zero ( no degradation ) to 0.05 arcseconds or a relative loss of resolution of roughly 30% .",
    "it might be expected that the most significant difference between guide star fwhm and psf fwhm would occur with the faintest guide stars and the largest separation between the psf stars and ao guide stars .",
    "we see no significant evidence that this is the case .",
    "the closest psf star ( at @xmath68 separation ) does have a @xmath67fwhm which is close to zero , however , at larger separations other psf stars with @xmath67fwhm close to zero can be found .",
    "the ao guide star - qso separations are @xmath69 , and in this range there is no observable trend of @xmath67fwhm with separation . over the range of ao guide star magnitudes used for our targets",
    "there is also no evidence of any correlation between guide star magnitude and @xmath67fwhm .    in summary ,",
    "we see that there is typically a degradation of @xmath70 ( full range of @xmath71 ) at the separations used in our observations .",
    "however the amount of degradation does not seem to depend on any observable parameters .",
    "this dispersion in @xmath67fwhm will be accounted for in our analysis below .",
    "given the above estimates of the psf variations , we now attempt to model the qso images , in order to derive the fundamental parameters of the host galaxies .",
    "the images of the 12 ao guide star / qso pairs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qsoim ] .",
    "both images are displayed on the same scale , and the contours are at 0.5 mag arcsec@xmath72 intervals .",
    "the level of the lowest contour is set to be the first contour above 5 times the rms sky noise .",
    "also plotted are the radial profiles for both the ao guide stars and qsos .",
    "the profiles are determined relative to the image centroid , and are averaged in 2 pixel bins .",
    "the errors are the standard errors derived from the dispersion in each bin , and do not take into account errors in the psf .",
    "the ao guide star profile ( solid line ) has been normalized to the qso , based on the total flux within a 0.2 arcsec radius aperture .",
    "although we have not broadened the ao guide star psf , we see that in many cases it matches closely the psf of the qso .",
    "this demonstrates that in most cases the ao guide star gives a good estimate of the psf . by a straight forward comparison of the profiles",
    ", we can see that few of the qsos show evidence for an extended component .",
    "the qso 2qz j133311.4@xmath24001949 is the best example of a source with an extended component , with the qso radial profile being significantly broader that the ao guide star psf . in our model fitting below we will assess the significance of this extended component and attempt to determine its parameters .",
    "if the form of the host galaxy luminosity profile is known reasonably well then an effective way to detect the presence of a host galaxy is to do a simultaneous fit of the nuclear point source and the host galaxy luminosity profile including the convolution with the psf .",
    "this procedure can also yield reliable limits on the brightness and other properties of possible sources in the case of no detection .",
    "this procedure requires assumptions about the possible range of morphologies of sources .",
    "most nearby massive galaxies have luminosity profiles that are reasonably well - described by some combination of an exponential disk and a more compact component , often modelled using the devaucouleurs @xmath73 law form .",
    "@xcite extended this approach by adding a point - source component and the results suggest that the characteristics of the underlying host galaxy can be extracted reliably given a sufficient combination of signal - to - noise ratio and spatial resolution .",
    "this approach is adopted for the present study .",
    "the details of the fitting procedure are similar to those described in @xcite . for each image",
    "a fit was made with the three components described above .",
    "given the relationship between spheroids and massive central objects @xcite we are particularly interested in the detection of bulge - like components .",
    "models were integrated over each pixel and convolved with the adopted psf .",
    "our observational procedure provides a first - order estimate of the psf ( based on the ao guide star ) and our separate psf star observations provide an estimate of the change in the psf from the guide star position to the position of the qso . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] we observe scatter in the quantity @xmath74 ( the change in the full - width at half maximum of a point source between the guide star position and the science target position ) rather than systematic variations in fwhm and the other properties ( ellipticity and major axis position angle ) that could be used to make precise predictions of the characteristics of the psf at the science target position . in the absence of a predictive trend , our best estimate of the psf at the science target positions is the guide star psf broadened by @xmath75 arcseconds . with this assumption",
    "we expect @xmath76 of the observations to have fwhm that lie within 0.02 arcseconds of that predicted resolution .    in practice",
    ", we deal with the psf uncertainty by fitting each science image with three psfs .",
    "these cover a range of fwhm values from that of the observed ao guide star to 0.040.05 arcseconds greater than the ao guide star .",
    "this range of @xmath74 is approximate , as we chose actual psfs from other observations to use as the broadened psfs , rather than trying to artificially broaden the ao guide star psf . in a small number of cases psfs of the required fwhm",
    "were not avaiable , and so for these objects , psfs were constructed based on the observed ao guide star using the iraf magnify task .",
    "the management of the psfs was done using daophot @xcite which models the psf by a combination of an analytical function and a look - up table of residuals .",
    "this psf can then be centered at any position with respect to the pixel grid .      in order to understand the effectiveness of the fitting procedure an extensive set of simulations",
    "were performed where images of galaxies with known size , surface brightness , and morphology were created and then subjected to the fitting procedure and the outcome evaluated . in particular , we estimated the probability of detecting elliptical host galaxies of luminosities @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . at redshift",
    "@xmath15 a @xmath78 elliptical galaxy subject to passive evolution ( assuming a single burst of star formation at @xmath80 ) corresponds to an observed @xmath81 mag ( being @xmath82 mag more luminous in the rest frame @xmath60-band than at @xmath83 ) .",
    "luminosities of @xmath77 and @xmath79 correspond to @xmath50-band apparent magnitudes of 19.8 and 18.6 respectively .",
    "the relation between size and luminosity is taken from schade , barrientos , & lopez - cruz ( 1997 ) and corresponds to half - light radius ( @xmath84 ) of 0.37 , 0.65 , and 0.90 arcseconds for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "for each source , the observed @xmath50 magnitude was taken to be the sum of a nuclear point source and a host galaxy with pure bulge morphology ( no disk component ) with luminosity of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , or @xmath79 and this assumption determined the division of light between the bulge and nuclear point - source components .",
    "the sources in our sample with the brightest apparent magnitudes are completely dominated by the point source component and any host galaxy would thus be very difficult to detect unless it were extremely luminous .",
    "pure bulge components for the host galaxy represent the most difficult case for detection by the fitting process because disk components would be expected , in general , to be more extended at a given luminosity and thus easier to separate from the point source . thus if the host galaxies had disk morphologies then the probability of detecting them would be higher at a given luminosity than the estimates for elliptical hosts .",
    "simulations were prepared on a source - by - source basis using the actual exposure times , sky brightnesses ( which varied significantly ) , and noise characteristics for the images of each object ( we also included repeat observations apart from the april 22 observation of j112839.8015929 which has a short integration time and poor seeing ) . in each case , a model of the final deep qso image was added to a suitable sky frame ( rather than simulating each frame of our dithered observations ) .",
    "the relation between the resolution of the ao guide star ( our first order psf ) and the actual resolution at the position of the qso was estimated from those frames where two or more stars were available on the frame ( see section [ sec : psf ] above ) .",
    "centering errors were introduced into the simulations by assigning fractional - pixel positions that varied randomly so that each galaxy was centered differently with respect to the pixel grid .",
    "then the centroiding algorithm was applied to the simulated images to determine the center for the purposes of the fitting procedure .",
    "this is a relevant source of error because the psf and the models are both discrete before convolution and a discrete fast fourier transform is used to accomplish the convolution .",
    "the uncertainty in the psf is a major source of error in detecting galaxies and estimating their sizes and surface brightness .",
    "each set of 100 simulations was repeated with 5 different psfs which varied in fwhm around the true value from 0.02 arcseconds smaller to 0.02 arcseconds larger than the value that was used to create the simulated galaxy image .",
    "therefore , each of our observations of acceptable quality was simulated 1500 times ( 100 simulations for each of 3 model galaxy luminosities and each of 5 psfs ) .",
    "each observation was also simulated 500 times ( 100 simulations for each of 5 psfs ) with only a point source .",
    "[ fig : mumag ] shows the results of these simulations .",

    "few galaxies at @xmath77 were detected .",
    "two thirds ( 67.6% ) of the simulated @xmath77 galaxies were fitted with half - light radii at the fitting limit of 0.05 arcseconds . from this figure",

    "[ fig : mumag ] represents unphysical sets of parameters for galaxies in the local universe .    for the purposes of estimating sensitivity a successful detection will be defined as a fitting result giving a galaxy brighter than @xmath85 and with a half - light radius larger than 0.2 arcseconds .",
    "further , we will require that the surface brightness in @xmath50 is less than 14 magnitudes per square arcsecond . with this definition",
    "we find globally that 1.2 per cent of the simulations of pure point sources are detected as galaxies so that the rate of spurious detections is small even including the effect of psf errors .",
    "table [ tab : sims ] gives the fhwm and total @xmath50 magnitdue for each observation together with the detection probabilities assuming an elliptical host galaxy of the given luminosity .",
    "probabilities are shown for the case where the psf is known exactly and for a case where there are uncertainties in the psf . for the latter case the average",
    "is weighted with the case of a perfect psf given a weight of unity and errors of 0.01 and 0.02 in the fwhm of the psf given weights of 0.5 and 0.25 respectively .",
    "these weights are a crude way to include the fact that the larger errors are less likely to occur than the smaller errors .",
    "we have insufficient information to do better than this estimate .",
    "the detection probabilities range from 0 to 1 and only a fraction of our observations have significant sensitivity to the galaxies that we have modelled .",
    "our observations have very little sensitivity to galaxies less luminous that @xmath77 .",
    "this is largely due to their small size ( @xmath86 , compared to @xmath87 for a @xmath78 galaxy ) .",
    "the sum of the probabilities at each luminosity can be taken as the expected number of galaxies that would have been detected at a given luminosity if all qsos resided in host galaxies at that luminosity . using the weighted probability we would have expected 0.4 galaxies of luminosity @xmath77 to be detected , 2.6 galaxies at @xmath78 , or 4.0 galaxies of @xmath79 under the assumptions stated .",
    "the expected number of detected galaxies is slightly higher if the psf uncertainties are negligible ( 0.2 , 3.3 , and 4.6 galaxies respectively ) . in some cases ,",
    "when the detection probability is low , the probability is greater when allowing for psf errors .",
    "this is due to spurious detections .",
    "we also note that the four objects for which we have reasonable probabilities of detecting host galaxies are the faintest four sources in our sample .",

    "although we have used a simple model ( a single instantaneous burst ) to describe host galaxy passive evolution , it is worth noting that any more complex model ( e.g. with on - going star - formation ) is likely to show much stronger evolution so long as star formation declines towards low redshift .",

    "2000 ) :      where @xmath106 is the agn luminosity expressed in terms of the eddington luminosity , @xmath107 is the mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath60 band , bc is the bolometic correction from @xmath60 to total luminosity for the agn and @xmath108 in the fraction of spheroid mass in the black hole .",
    "i.e. that the fraction of black hole mass to bulge mass is at least an order of magnitude higher at @xmath0 than at @xmath116 .",
    "equally , an increase in the efficiency of the black hole to @xmath117 could also account for the observed upper limit on the bulge luminosity whilst maintaining @xmath118 .",
    "however , in either case , the faintness of the host galaxy at @xmath119 in relation to observations at low redshift suggests that the conditions in agn at @xmath119 are fundamentally different to those studied at lower redshift ; requiring at least an order of magnitude change in the eddington luminosity ratio or in the mass of the black hole in relation to the bulge mass of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , a recent analysis of qso spectra from the 2qz shows that the black hole mass to agn luminosity relation does not appear to evolve strongly with redshift over the range @xmath120 ( corbett et al.2003 ) .",
    "this observation implies little if any change in the value of @xmath106 over this redshift range , suggesting that it is the evolution of black hole mass ( and thus the bulge - to - black hole mass ratio ) , rather than fuelling rate , that is driving the observed evolution of the qso luminosity function .",
    "thus , more massive black holes are active at high redshift .",
    "this rather counter - intuative picture suggests that qsos would have a single active phase at the formation of the spheroid , the subsequent evolution in the qso lf reflecting the decreasing efficiency with which massive black holes could be formed in a spheroid of given mass over the range @xmath121 .",
    "this clearly needs further investigation , as the evolution of the black hole mass to bulge mass correlation at high redshift is a crucial to understanding the formation of qsos .",

    "<S> we present results of a gemini adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging program to investigate the host galaxies of typical qsos at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to study the host galaxies of typical , @xmath1 qsos at the epoch of peak qso and star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> the large database of faint qsos provided by the 2df qso redshift survey allows us to select a sample of qsos at @xmath2 which have nearby ( @xmath3 arcsecond separation ) bright stars suitable for use as ao guide stars . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed a sample of 9 qsos . </S>",
    "<S> the images of these sources have ao corrected full - width at half - maximum of between 0.11 and 0.25 arcseconds . </S>",
    "<S> we use multiple observations of point spread function ( psf ) calibration star pairs in order to quantify any uncertainty in the psf . </S>",
    "<S> we then factored these uncertainties into our modelling of the qso plus host galaxy . in only one case </S>",
    "<S> did we convincingly detect a host ( 2qz j133311.4 + 001949 , at @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this host galaxy has @xmath5 mag with a half - light radius , @xmath6 , equivalent to @xmath7 assuming a simple passively evolving model . from detailed simulations of our host galaxy modelling process </S>",
    "<S> , we find that for four of our targets we should be sensitive to host galaxies that are equivalent to @xmath8 ( passively evolved ) . </S>",
    "<S> our non - detections therefore place tight constraints on the properties of @xmath1 qso host galaxies , which can be no brighter ( after allowing for passive evolution ) than the host galaxies of @xmath1 agn at low redshift , although the qsos themselves are a factor of @xmath9 brighter . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that either the fueling efficiency is much greater at high redshift , or that more massive black holes are active at high redshift . </S>"
