    "the large mass of heavy quarks ( @xmath3 1.3 and 4.3 gev/@xmath4 , repectively ) is expected to cause a suppression of gluon radiation at forward angles , known as the  dead cone effect \" @xcite .",
    "if radiative energy loss in the hot medium is the dominant suppression mechanism in au+au collisions , this leads to the expectation that @xmath5 .",
    "in central au+au collisions , a large suppression has been measured relative to the yield in @xmath0 scaled by the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions , suggesting a significant energy loss by heavy quarks in the medium @xcite .",
    "the phenix collaboration measures open heavy flavor through the semi - leptonic decay of these quarks to electrons at midrapidity .",
    "a cocktail of background electrons from hadronic decays and photon conversions is subtracted from the inclusive electron yield to isolate the contribution from heavy quarks ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "preliminary phenix results using improved electron identification techniques have extended the range of this measurement in @xmath0 collisions from @xmath6 = 9 gev/@xmath7 out to 14 gev/@xmath7 , and agree well with previously published data .",
    "this technique of measuring heavy quarks through their decay to electrons does not allow separation of the contributions from charm quarks and bottom quarks .",
    "however , perturbative qcd calculations and measurements in @xmath0 collisions at rhic show that electrons from bottom decays begin to dominate over those from charm at @xmath8gev/@xmath7 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the ratio of electrons from charm to those from bottom measured in @xmath0 would hold in au+au collisions only if the charm and bottom quark energy loss were identical . in the conventional picture of quark energy loss",
    ", charm loses more energy than bottom , which would shift the electrons from charm decay to lower transverse momentum and thereby increase the concentration of electrons from bottom at high @xmath6 , relative to the @xmath0 baseline . in any case , the heavy flavor electron @xmath9 shown in fig .",

    "the heavy quark production mechanism is sensitive to the gluon density in the nucleus , so inital state effects ( such as shadowing or gluon saturation ) could possibly affect charm and bottom cross sections . also , the mass - ordered cronin enhancement that is observed for light - flavored hadrons @xcite could conceivably play a role in the heavier @xmath10 and @xmath11 meson families . to examine these phenomena ,",

    "is not observed , suggesting that the effect is indeed due to energy loss in the hot nuclear medium .",
    "on the contrary , a possible enhancement is present for @xmath13 4 gev/@xmath7 , although the large uncertainties limit this observation .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is the same @xmath6 range that electrons from charm decays are expected to dominate , and the possible enhancement disappears as the relative proportion of electrons from bottom decays increases .",
    "these cold nuclear matter effects are expected to be present in au+au collisions , but are convoluted with suppression effects in hot nuclear matter .",
    "if there is some cnm enhancement of open charm but not bottom , this could potentially explain the heavy quark energy loss paradox apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "charm quarks could suffer a larger energy loss in the medium than bottom , and still appear to be less suppressed because of an enhanced initial state .",
    "if all quark flavors have the same energy loss in the medium , the pion and bottom quark @xmath9 would be equivalent ( as can be inferred from the high @xmath6 behavior in fig .",

    "the large suppression of electrons from heavy flavor decays observed in central au+au collisions at @xmath17 gev is not observed in @xmath1au and peripheral cu+cu collisions .",
    "this implies that the suppression is due to energy loss in the hot nuclear medium produced in central collisions of large nuclei , rather than initial state effects intrinsic to the nucleus or parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter .",
