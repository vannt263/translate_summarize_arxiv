    "many observations suggest that clusters of galaxies contain substantial amounts of mass in the form of a background intergalactic stellar component ( e.g. , vlchez - gmez et al .",
    "1994 ; scheick , kuhn 1994 ; ferguson et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "it has usually been thought that such a component has its origin in stars stripped from galaxies by galaxy ",
    "galaxy encounters , or by the cluster tidal field . however , detailed numerical simulations of galaxy clusters are required to confirm how efficient such mass stripping is and how the structure of the background component evolves .",
    "it was only recently that fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulation of galaxy clusters , with each galaxy represented by many particles , was made possible , because such a full simulation requires huge computing resources .",
    "funato et al .",
    "( 1993 ) investigated the evolution of isolated clusters of galaxies using self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "similar simulations were also performed by bode et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and garijo et al .",
    "more recently , sensui et al .  ( 1999 , sfm99 ; 2000 , sfm00 ) followed up the study of funato et al .",
    "( 1993 ) by performing larger @xmath0 simulations for a wider variety of initial conditions . in their simulations , clusters",
    "were initially in virial equilibrium , and all of the cluster mass was initially bound to individual galaxies ; a cluster was composed of about 100 identical galaxies , and each galaxy was modeled with 5004000 particles . sfm99 and sfm00 found that , in all cases , more than half of of the total mass is stripped from galaxies in a few crossing times of the cluster , and that the stripped matter forms a smooth cluster - wide common halo .",
    "they also found that a density cusp , approximated as @xmath6 ( @xmath3 being form @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) , develops in the central region .",
    "however , the physical mechanism of the cusp formation was not clear .",
    "even if we are allowed to regard clusters of galaxies as `` pure '' self - gravitating many - body systems composed of point masses ( stars and dark matter particles ) , we have to admit that their evolution is complicated by many physical processes which take place simultaneously : gravitational encounters , physical collisions , and merging between galaxies ; galaxy  background particle interactions , mass stripping from galaxies , internal evolution of galaxies , etc .",
    "therefore , there is no doubt that fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations are most desirable to obtain qualitatively and quantitatively reliable results on cluster evolution ( see garca - gmez et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , more idealized or more simplified models that include ( part of ) relevant physical processes in approximate ways , such as fokker  planck ( fp , hereafter ) models which we used in the present study , are still very useful regarding two points .",
    "first , we can quickly obtain an overview of cluster evolution based on various initial conditions by using approximate models , which are inexpensive in computation time .",
    "second , it is expected that we can understand more clearly the role and importance of each physical process , because we can easily separate the effects of various processes in approximate models . on the other hand , it is often difficult to `` understand '' the results of @xmath0-body simulations , where all processes are automatically included and connected through a complicated procedure",
    ". thus , @xmath0-body and approximate models are complementary to each other , and comparison between these models will be particularly helpful to our further understanding of the physics of cluster evolution , regardless of whether agreement or disagreement is found .",
    "merritt ( 1983 , 1984 , 1985 ) explored the evolution of clusters of galaxies using such approximate models based on an isotropic orbit - averaged fp equation ( cohn 1980 ) .",
    "the fp equation describes the evolution of the phase - space distribution function driven by gravitational two - body encounters , and has been applied mainly to globular clusters ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1987 for a review ) . a typical cluster of galaxies is composed of @xmath9 1001000 galaxies , and thus the time scale of two - body relaxation between galaxies , @xmath10 , is of the same order as the crossing time of the cluster , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore , two - body relaxation is expected to play an important role in the evolution of galaxy clusters . in his models ,",
    "merritt also took account of mass stripping from galaxies due to tidal interactions between galaxies .",
    "since the stripped particles ( stars or dark matter particles ) were considered to be much lighter than galaxies , these particles were treated as being massless .",
    "dynamical friction between the galaxies and the background massless particles was also included .",
    "thus , in merritt s models the evolution of the galaxies and the background was treated self - consistently .",
    "fp models are continuum models , and therefore have an advantage that they are free from statistical fluctuations , which are unavoidable in @xmath0-body models and make it difficult to understand the underlying physics",
    ". yepes et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and yepes and domnguez - tenreiro ( 1992 ) studied the evolution of galaxy clusters by solving the moment equations of the fp equation .",
    "they also included a background component of massless particles in their models , but did not take account of tidal stripping .",
    "the purpose of the present work was to investigate the dynamical evolution of clusters of galaxies after virialization .",
    "in particular , we aimed to clarify the physical mechanisms of the growth of the common halo , and of the development of the central density cusp , which were investigated by sfm99 and sfm00 with @xmath0-body models . for this purpose ,",
    "we used fp models , which are based on merritt s ( 1983 ) formulation , but are improved in many aspects , and compare them with the self - consistent @xmath0-body models of sfm99 and sfm00 .",
    "as shown below , the results of the fp and @xmath0-body models agree with each other surprisingly well .",
    "this suggests that our fp models correctly include all important physical processes , and thus can be used as a useful tool for studying the dynamics of galaxy clusters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic equations of the fp models are given in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the initial conditions of our simulations , and section 4 briefly describes the numerical schemes used for our fp and @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the simulation results are given in sections 5 and 6 ; in section 5 , the fp and @xmath0-body models are compared with respect to the growth of the common halo and the development of the central cusp ; in section 6 , the physical mechanism of the cusp formation is examined in detail based on fp models .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section 7 .",
    "in this section , we describe fp models of clusters of galaxies . in fp models , individual galaxies are treated as point particles , except that the effects of tidal stripping are considered .",
    "detailed fp simulations of galaxy clusters were first performed by merritt ( 1983 ) .",
    "we closely follow his formulation .",
    "there are , however , three major differences between his and our models : ( 1 ) merritt used isotropic fp models , but we used anisotropic fp models .",
    "( 2 ) we used a new cross - section formula of mass stripping from galaxies based on recent @xmath0-body experiments by funato and makino ( 1999 , fm ) . ( 3 ) dissipation of the orbital kinetic energies of galaxies during galaxy  galaxy encounters was also considered , while it was neglected in merritt s simulations .",
    "consider a self - gravitating many - body system composed of different mass components with particle mass @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we write the _ number density _ in @xmath15-space , i.e. the distribution function , of component @xmath13 as @xmath16 . by assuming that the system is spherically symmetric and in dynamical equilibrium",
    ", @xmath17 can be written as a function of the energy per unit mass , @xmath18 , and the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath19 .",
    "then , the orbit - averaged fp equation , under the fixed gravitational potential , can be written as follows ( cohn 1979 ; takahashi 1997 ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the scaled angular momentum , @xmath22 is a weight function , and @xmath23 , etc .",
    "are flux coefficients .",
    "see takahashi ( 1997 ) for a complete description of this equation . to follow the evolution of the system ,",
    "this fp equation is solved in combination with poisson s equation ( cohn 1979 ) .",
    "we introduce the _ mass density _ in phase space , @xmath24 here , we choose the @xmath25 component for representing the background , or a common halo .",
    "we can assume that the mass of a background particle ( star ) is negligible compared to that of a galaxy .",
    "however , the mass density of background particles is comparable to that of galaxies .",
    "we now take the limit @xmath26 while keeping @xmath27 finite ( i.e. @xmath28 ) . in the fp equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) , component mass @xmath13 appears only in the flux coefficients . in the limit @xmath26",
    ", the expressions for the first and second - order flux coefficients look like @xmath29 note that we write here only the dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath30 symbolically .",
    "exact expressions can be easily obtained from the equations given in the appendix of takahashi ( 1997 ) .",
    "the fp equation for the background component ( @xmath25 ) becomes @xmath31 which is obtained by multiplying equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) by @xmath32 and then taking the limit @xmath26 .",
    "since the background particles are massless , they are completely collisionless , i.e. , they do not interact with each other .",
    "however , galaxies suffer dynamical friction from the background particles that have a finite mass density .",
    "thus , the orbital energy of the galaxies is transferred to the background .",
    "consider an encounter between _ a test galaxy _ of mass @xmath33 and _ a field galaxy _ of mass @xmath34 , with impact parameter @xmath35 and relative velocity @xmath36 .",
    "fm showed , both numerically and analytically , that the relative change of the test galaxy s mass in an encounter can be approximated by @xmath37 with @xmath38 23 and @xmath39 23 , for the cases with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 is a dimensionless constant , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the size ( represented by the virial radius in the following ) and the three - dimensional internal velocity dispersion of the test galaxy , respectively .",
    "since fm did not carry out simulations of encounters between unequal - mass galaxies , the value of @xmath46 is not determined from their simulations . in the impulse approximation ,",
    "the velocity change of a star , @xmath47 , is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , if the effect of the term @xmath48 is dominant in removing mass from the test galaxy , we may expect @xmath49 ; on the other hand , if the effect of the term @xmath50 is dominant , @xmath51 ( see merritt 1983 ; fm ) .",
    "now suppose that a test galaxy experiences successive encounters with field galaxies of mass @xmath34 .",
    "the rate of change in the test galaxy s mass is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number density of the field galaxies and @xmath54 is the ( normalized ) distribution function of the relative velocity between the test and field galaxies ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the minimum and maximum impact parameters , respectively .",
    "if we assume a maxwellian distribution with a three - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath57 , for @xmath58 , this equation becomes @xmath59 here , we define @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the first integral becomes @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , if we take @xmath55 and @xmath56 as the size of the galaxy and that of the cluster , we may consider that the integral remains roughly constant during the cluster evolution for @xmath66 23 .",
    "the second integral is also a constant of the order of unity for @xmath67 23 ; it equals 1 when @xmath68 , and @xmath69 when @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we may rewrite equation ( [ eq : ml2 ] ) as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a dimensionless constant factor and @xmath73 is the mass density of the field galaxies .",
    "note that the definition of @xmath72 depends on @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath68 , for example , @xmath76 for @xmath63 , and @xmath77 for @xmath65 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ml3 ] ) includes two parameters of galaxy s internal structure , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "because fp models do not follow the internal evolution of galaxies , we have to adopt some relations to express the changes in these parameters by @xmath33 only .",
    "one such relation should be the virial theorem , @xmath78 .",
    "as the other relation we assume @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81@xmath82 ( see fm and sfm99 ) . using these relations",
    "we may write the two parameters as @xmath83 finally , we obtain @xmath84 where a sum over all galaxy components @xmath85 is taken . we then orbit - average ( see , e.g. , takahashi 1997 ) equation ( [ eq : ml4 ] ) to obtain the mass - loss rate as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "stars escape from galaxies via galaxy  galaxy encounters .",
    "this is possible because part of the orbital kinetic energies of galaxies is converted into the energy of internal motions of the stars in the galaxies .",
    "that is , these encounters are inelastic . if the sum of the galaxy binding energies is much smaller than the cluster binding energy , i.e. , if @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the cluster velocity dispersion ) , the effect of energy dissipation due to inelastic encounters is not very important .",
    "however , for our model clusters shown below , this condition is not well satisfied [ @xmath88 , and therefore energy dissipation is expected to play a non - negligible role .",
    "the binding energy of a galaxy ( in virial equilibrium ) is @xmath89 .",
    "the rate of its change is therefore given by @xmath90 here , in the second equality , we used equation ( [ eq : vg - m ] ) .",
    "the mass - loss rate is given by equation ( [ eq : ml4 ] ) .",
    "the decrease in the binding energy of a galaxy should be compensated by a decrease in the orbital kinetic energies of the galaxies involved in encounters with that galaxy . for simplicity , we assume that the change in the binding energy of a galaxy is just equal to the change in its orbital energy , and that the stripped stars have the same orbital energy per unit mass as that of the parent galaxy .",
    "this is valid at least on average .",
    "the dissipation rate of the orbital energy of galaxy @xmath33 is given by @xmath91 ( remember @xmath18 represents the energy per units mass ) .",
    "the above assumption ensures that the total energy of a galaxy cluster , including the internal energies of the galaxies , is conserved .",
    "the distribution function evolves owing to mass stripping from galaxies as well as owing to two - body relaxation .",
    "the effect of mass stripping can be included in the fp equation by adding a source ( or sink ) term ( see , e.g. , quinlan , shapiro 1989 ) .",
    "thus , in this case the fp equation becomes @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the fp collision term [ the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) ] and @xmath94 represents the source term due to mass stripping .",
    "we neglect merging events between galaxies for simplicity . for the initial conditions which we adopted in this work",
    ", @xmath0-body simulations showed that mergers were rare ( sfm99 ; sfm00 ) .",
    "therefore , neglect of merging events would not cause serious errors for our models .",
    "the source term is calculated in practice as follows .    for each galaxy component @xmath95 and for each grid point in @xmath96 space",
    ", we can calculate the change in mass @xmath97 during a time step @xmath98 from the orbit - averaged stripping rate , @xmath99 .",
    "thus , we know that galaxies of mass @xmath100 at time @xmath101 and position @xmath96 will have mass @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) at time @xmath104 , and that each of these galaxies provides mass @xmath105 for the background .",
    "the number of the galaxies does not change during this mass loss , unless they are completely disrupted .",
    "since we use discrete mass components , a new mass @xmath106 is generally not equal to any components @xmath107 , and therefore we have to somehow distribute the galaxies of mass @xmath106 among some components . as lee ( 1987 ) and quinlan and shapiro ( 1989 ) did for stellar mergers in star clusters , we distribute the galaxies by linear interpolation : if @xmath108 galaxies of mass @xmath106 are to be formed and if @xmath109 , then @xmath110 galaxies are added to the @xmath107 component and @xmath111 galaxies are added to the @xmath112 component . if @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is a minimum galaxy mass assumed , the galaxies are distributed between @xmath115 ( background ) and @xmath114 .",
    "further we assume that the galaxies after mass stripping and the ejected background particles have the same orbital energy and angular momentum per unit mass @xmath96 as the galaxies had before stripping .",
    "the effect of energy dissipation is considered separately , as described below .    by doing the above procedure over all of the galaxy components at each grid point in @xmath96 space",
    ", we can calculate the change in the distribution function due to mass stripping , i.e. , the source term , @xmath94 . note that this procedure guarantees conservation of the total mass and energy of the cluster .",
    "merritt ( 1983 ) formulated mass stripping as a first - order `` mass diffusion '' term in the fp equation [ see his equation ( 22 ) ] . in his formulation he assumed a distribution function , @xmath116 , which is continuous with respect to @xmath33 as well as @xmath18 . in integrating the fp equation numerically , he used , of course , discrete mass grids . on the other hand ,",
    "we have assumed discrete mass components from the beginning .",
    "although merritt s formulation and our formulation may look different apparently , they both consider only the first - order term @xmath117 and are essentially the same .    the effect of energy dissipation ( cooling ) is included in the fp equation in the same way as the effect of binary heating in star clusters ( see , e.g. , takahashi 1997 ) .",
    "that is , the cooling term , which may be calculated from equation ( [ eq : edis ] ) , is added to the first - order energy coefficient , @xmath118 . in practice , the amount of energy dissipation during @xmath98 is calculated so that it should be consistent with the above - described way of distributing stripped galaxies among mass components .",
    "a commonly used definition of the two - body relaxation time is given by spitzer ( 1987 , equation [ 2 - 61 ] ) as @xmath119 . here",
    ", a maxwellian velocity distribution of field particles is assumed and @xmath120 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion ; @xmath121 is the mean square value of the change per unit time in the velocity component parallel to the initial velocity of a test particle , evaluated at @xmath122 . for the present cases , assuming that all galaxy components follow maxwellian velocity distributions with the same velocity dispersion , @xmath87",
    ", we obtain @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the total density of the galaxies and @xmath125 is the _ mass - weighted _ mean galaxy mass . equation ( [ eq : tr ] ) represents the time scale of the velocity diffusion due to encounters between galaxies .",
    "similarly , we define the dynamical friction time as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the mean change per unit time in the velocity component parallel to the initial velocity , evaluated at @xmath122 . on the same assumptions",
    "as used in deriving equation ( [ eq : tr ] ) , we find that the dynamical friction time for a galaxy of mass @xmath33 is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the total density including both the galaxy and halo components . unlike the relaxation time ( [ eq : tr ] ) , the dynamical friction time ( [ eq : tdf ] ) depends on the test - particle mass and on the halo density . from equations ( [ eq : tr ] ) and ( [ eq : tdf ] )",
    ", it follows that @xmath130 in single - component clusters , @xmath131 . in multicomponent clusters ,",
    "@xmath132 can be much smaller than @xmath10 for massive galaxies ; this holds also for light galaxies , if @xmath133 .",
    "we define the tidal mass stripping time as @xmath134 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : ml4 ] ) with @xmath135 set equal to @xmath136 , we find @xmath137 using equations ( [ eq : tdf ] ) and ( [ eq : tts ] ) , with @xmath138 , we obtain @xmath139 for our standard set of parameters , @xmath140 , @xmath68 , and @xmath141 ( see section [ sec : r1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath142 this indicates that @xmath143 in our initial models ( see section [ sec : ic ] ) . as the fraction of the common halo increases , tidal stripping becomes less important ( merritt 1983 ) .",
    "we use the same initial cluster model as that in sfm99 .",
    "that is , the initial model is a plummer model composed of @xmath144 identical galaxies with no common halo .",
    "exceptions are models fpa1 and fpa2 , which we describe later .",
    "the initial galaxy model is also given by a plummer model as in sfm99 .",
    "the ratio of the virial radius of each galaxy @xmath145 to the virial radius of the cluster @xmath146 is set equal to @xmath147 .",
    "note that initial galaxy models affect fp models only through the mass - stripping rate , equation ( [ eq : ml4 ] ) .",
    "this equation includes two parameters of the internal structure of galaxies , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , but these are related by the virial theorem ( we take @xmath150 ) for a given galaxy s mass .",
    "hence , in fp models the structure of galaxies is represented by only one parameter , e.g. , @xmath145 . in reality",
    ", even if the virial radii are the same , different galaxy models will give different stripping rates .",
    "such differences in galaxy models could be reflected in fp models only by adjusting an undetermined numerical constant , @xmath72 , in equation ( [ eq : ml4 ] ) .",
    "we use a system of units in which @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the gravitational constant ( heggie , mathieu 1986 ) ; hence @xmath155 . for the cluster",
    ", we have @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , @xmath146 , and @xmath160 are the mass , virial radius , and binding energy of the cluster , respectively .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion of stars in a galaxy is @xmath161 , and that of galaxies in the cluster is @xmath162 .",
    "the cluster crossing time is @xmath163 and the half - mass relaxation time ( spitzer 1987 , equation [ 2 - 63 ] ) is @xmath164 where the cluster half - mass radius @xmath165 and the coulomb logarithm @xmath166 . if we assume that @xmath167 and @xmath168 , the cluster model has @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "only models fpa1 and fpa2 have a common halo initially ( see subsection  [ sec : r1.1 ] ) ; the ratio of the common halo mass to the total mass , @xmath173 , is @xmath174 and @xmath175 , or if the mass is converted into the number of galaxies , @xmath176 and 32 , for fpa1 and fpa2 , respectively . galaxy and common halo components are distributed in space so that the ratio of their densities is independent of the radius .",
    "the other conditions are the same as those of the other models .",
    "details of the numerical integration scheme of the fp equation have been described by takahashi ( 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "we used 301 energy , 51 angular momentum , and 121 radial grid points .",
    "we used @xmath177 mass components for galaxies .",
    "these components are uniformly spaced in @xmath33 between 0 and 1 ; @xmath178 , @xmath179 ,  , @xmath180 .",
    "in addition , one component of @xmath115 was assigned to a background ( common halo ) .",
    "we confirmed that these numbers of grid points and mass components are large enough to obtain satisfactory convergence of the results .",
    "the relative errors in the total mass were less than 0.1% and those in the total energy were less than 0.5% in all runs .",
    "we calculated a number of fp models , switching on and off mass stripping and energy dissipation and changing the parameters of the stripping rate .",
    "these models are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we compared our fp models with the @xmath0-body models of sfm99 and sfm00 for the same initial conditions .",
    "sfm99 performed a number of simulations for the same initial theoretical model using different random realizations of the model and varying the number of particles for representing each galaxy ; they confirmed that the results of those simulations were almost the same . in section",
    "[ sec : r1 ] , the model pp of sfm00 , denoted by nb in this paper , is compared with the fp models .",
    "the simulation was carried out using grape-4 ( makino et al .",
    "1997 ) with the barnes  hut tree algorithm ( barnes , hut 1986 ; makino 1991 ; athanassoula et al .",
    "each initial galaxy model was represented by 2048 particles , and thus the total number of particles was 262144 . for more details of the numerical integration and for a galaxy identification scheme , see sfm99 and sfm00 .",
    "first we discuss the evolution of model clusters in which mass stripping from galaxies is not allowed , but which initially have massive common halos , in order to reveal how such multicomponent systems evolve owing to two - body relaxation only .",
    "although collisional evolution of multicomponent stellar systems has been investigated by many authors using fp models in the context of globular cluster evolution ( e.g. , inagaki , wiyanto 1984 ; cohn 1985 ; chernoff , weinberg 1990 ; takahashi 1997 and references therein ) , massless particle components were not considered in those studies . on the other hand , it is not very difficult to extrapolate the behavior of massless particles from the behavior of particles whose masses are much smaller than the mean particle mass . in that sense",
    ", no essentially new results were found in our simulations , as discussed below .",
    "however , it is useful to see first how `` pure '' collisional systems evolve before considering more complicated systems with mass stripping",
    ". yepes et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and yepes and domnguez - tenreiro ( 1992 ) also studied pure collisional evolution of galaxy clusters including massless particles , but using the moment equations of the fp equation .",
    "figure 1a shows the evolution of density profiles for model fpa1 ; the solid lines and dotted lines represent the galaxy and common halo components , respectively .",
    "figure 1b shows the corresponding profiles of the logarithmic gradient defined by @xmath181 figures 1c and 1d are for model fpa2 .",
    "we have assumed that the number of galaxies , @xmath182 , is 64 and 32 for fpa1 and fpa2 , respectively .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath182 is only concerned with time scaling ; if time is measured in units of the relaxation time , the evolution of these models does not depend on the number of galaxies , because only the two - body relaxation process is taken into account in them .",
    "we set the coulomb logarithm equal to @xmath183 for time scaling for both models .",
    "as is well known , energy redistribution among particles due to two - body relaxation eventually leads the cluster core to gravothermal core collapse ( lynden - bell , wood 1968 ; lynden - bell , eggleton 1980 ) ; after the onset of core collapse the central density continues to increase and the core radius continues to decrease , unless other physical mechanisms intervene .",
    "late core collapse proceeds self - similarly with the development of the power - law density cusp , @xmath184 .",
    "cohn ( 1980 ) found @xmath185 for single - component clusters . in multicomponent clusters",
    ", the most massive component eventually dominates the central part , i.e. , strong mass segregation occurs , owing to a tendency toward equipartition of energy .",
    "thereafter , the most massive component collapses as in single - component clusters and lighter components have shallower density cusps ( e.g. , inagaki , wiyanto 1984 ; chernoff , weinberg 1990 ) .",
    "the development of the density cusps of the galaxy and common - halo components through gravothermal core collapse is clearly shown in figure 1 .",
    "power - law cusps appear for @xmath186 .",
    "the slopes of the cusps hardly depend on the difference in the initial conditions of fpa1 and fpa2 ; the slope of the galaxy cusp approaches @xmath185 and the slope of the common - halo cusp is much shallower , @xmath187 , as expected .",
    "cohn ( 1985 ; see also chernoff , weinberg 1990 ) found that in deep collapse phases of multimass clusters , the power - law indices @xmath188 of the density profiles of different components are approximately related by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the particle mass of the most massive component , which dominates the central potential well .",
    "this equation is obtained on the assumption that the distribution function of component @xmath95 is given by @xmath191 with @xmath192 .",
    "this relation for @xmath193 was originally found by bahcall and wolf ( 1977 ) for a steady state solution of the stellar distribution around a central massive black hole . in deriving equation ( [ eq : alphai ] ) the results of numerical simulation ( cohn 1980 ) , @xmath194 and @xmath195 ,",
    "are also used .",
    "equation ( [ eq : alphai ] ) gives @xmath196 as @xmath197 .",
    "figures 1b and 1d show that the actual slope of the common halo cusp is slightly larger than this predicted value .",
    "such deviation from equation ( [ eq : alphai ] ) at small masses was also reported by chernoff and weinberg ( 1990 ) .    for models fpa1 and fpa2 , we followed the cluster evolution up to a rather deep collapse phase in order to see self - similar development of the density cusps .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that it is very unlikely that actual galaxy clusters can reach such deep collapse , because galaxies have appreciable finite sizes compared to the cluster sizes . for our model cluster ,",
    "the sizes of the galaxies are @xmath198 , and thus the core radius of the cluster can not be less than @xmath198 .      in this section",
    "we show the results of fp models in which mass stripping is included but energy dissipation is neglected , and compare these results with @xmath0-body results .",
    "figure  2a shows the fraction of the common halo mass to the total mass as a function of time for models fpb1 and nb .",
    "figure  2b shows the evolution of the central density of the galaxies and that of the common halo , @xmath199 and @xmath200 . for the @xmath0-body model the galaxy density",
    "is not plotted , because it changes very noisily with time owing to the small number of galaxies ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the center of the cluster of the @xmath0-body model was chosen to be the density center ( casertano , hut 1985 ) of the common halo particles .",
    "concerning the growth of the common halo mass , @xmath201 , the agreement between fpb1 and nb is pretty good , though the growth speed slows down somewhat earlier in fpb1 than in nb .",
    "actually , the value of the numerical constant , @xmath202 , in equation ( [ eq : ml4 ] ) for fpb1 was chosen to achieve such a good agreement .",
    "the initial growth rate of @xmath201 in the fp model is determined by only the stripping rate for given initial conditions .",
    "this means that we can always adjust @xmath72 to obtain a desirable initial growth rate .",
    "once its value is chosen , however , we have no freedom to adjust later growth of the common halo , which depends on evolving cluster properties .",
    "therefore , the fine tuning of @xmath72 is not responsible for the overall good agreement observed in figure 2a .    in principle",
    ", the value of @xmath72 can be determined from the data of @xmath0-body experiments of galaxy  galaxy encounters such as given by fm . however , its exact value depends on the detailed structure of the galaxies , which changes with time under the cluster environment . from equations ( [ eq : ml2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ml3 ] ) , we find , for @xmath68 , @xmath203 if @xmath63 , and @xmath204 if @xmath65 . hence @xmath202 corresponds to @xmath205 and 9.1 for @xmath63 and 3 , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ml0 ] ) with these values of @xmath43 is consistent , in order of magnitude , with the data of fm ( see their figures 7 , 8 , 11 , and 12 ) .",
    "models fpb1 and nb are in rather good agreement in the evolution of @xmath201 , but show a clear difference in @xmath200 evolution : the central density increases much more slowly in fpb1 than in nb .",
    "we will see below that the inclusion of energy dissipation , which makes the treatment of tidal stripping in fp models fully self - consistent , removes this difference .",
    "the initial quick increase in @xmath200 and the initial decrease in @xmath199 are simply due to the fact that mass stripping from the galaxies suddenly starts at @xmath206 . after a few cluster crossing times",
    ", the central galaxy density begins to increase .",
    "mass stripping works only to decrease the galaxy density by removing part of galaxy mass to the common halo .",
    "therefore , the increase in the galaxy density should be due to two - body relaxation . since the processes of core collapse and mass stripping occur simultaneously , the central density of the galaxies and that of the common halo stay comparable for a long time , while the central density is soon dominated by galaxies in models fpa1 and fpa2 where there is no mass stripping .",
    "figure  2b shows that the galaxy density finally exceeds the common halo density at the center even with mass stripping .",
    "we discuss in more detail the process of core collapse with mass stripping in section [ sec : r2 ] .    here , we mention the choice of the value of the coulomb logarithm .",
    "as noted above , the central density increase in model fpb1 is significantly slower than that in model nb .",
    "we found that rough agreement in the central density evolution was obtained when we artificially increased the two - body relaxation rate by about a factor of two without changing the mass stripping rate .",
    "increasing the relaxation rate by a factor of two is equivalent to doubling the coulomb logarithm , @xmath207 , i.e. , replacing @xmath208 with @xmath209 in the present case .",
    "there is some uncertainty for the choice of the exact value of @xmath210 , but it is very unlikely that such a large value as @xmath211 is justified .",
    "we now take account of the effects of both mass stripping and energy dissipation in fp models ( sequence fpc in table  1 ) .",
    "the evolution of model fpc1 ( our standard model ) is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the growth of @xmath201 in fpc1 is similar to that in fpb1 , although the former shows a slightly larger growth rate at late epochs .",
    "the difference between fpb1 and fpc1 is clear in the evolution of the central density , which increases more rapidly in fpc1 than in fpb1 .",
    "we now see good agreement between models fpc1 and nb in the central density evolution as well as in the evolution of the common halo mass . it should be recalled that energy dissipation is included consistently with mass stripping , without introducing any additional free parameters .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate how sensitively the behavior of fp models depends on the parameters of the mass stripping rate ( @xmath72 , @xmath75 , @xmath46 , and @xmath212 ) .",
    "the probable ranges of these parameters are limited by the results of @xmath0-body experiments and theoretical considerations ( see section [ sec : fpmodel2 ] ) .    in figure 4",
    "we compare models fpc1 , fpc2 , and fpc3 , which differ only in the value of @xmath72 ( @xmath213 25 , 15 , 35 ) .",
    "larger @xmath72 gives a higher stripping rate , and consequently faster growth in the mass of the common halo . at early epochs the central density of the common halo also increases more quickly for larger @xmath72 , but at late epochs it increases more slowly because faster mass stripping prevents the density increase more severely .",
    "we conclude that the value of @xmath202 gives the best agreement between the fp and @xmath0-body results .",
    "figure 5 compares models fpc1 , fpc4 , fpc5 , and fpc6 , which differ in the value of @xmath75 , @xmath46 , or @xmath212 ( see table 1 ) . for model fpc4",
    "it is necessary to adjust the value of @xmath72 so that the initial growth rate of the common halo becomes similar to those of the other models . these models are not very different from one another .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the results of fp simulations do not very sensitively depend on the mass - stripping formula as long as the parameters are in reasonable ranges .    one noticeable difference is seen in the evolution of the central density of model fpc5 ( @xmath214 ) ; at late epochs the central density increases more slowly compared with the other models .",
    "we find that this is because massive galaxies are much more depleted in model fpc5 . in all models , the mean galaxy mass @xmath215 in the central regions first decreases quickly and then stays roughly constant as the galaxy density increases . at late epochs ,",
    "@xmath216 at the center for model fpc5 and @xmath217 for the others .",
    "this implies that the collapse rate of fpc5 is smaller by about a factor of two .",
    "equation ( [ eq : tts ] ) tells us why such a difference occurs ; tidal stripping time @xmath218 is proportional to @xmath219 for @xmath140 , but @xmath218 does not depend on @xmath215 for @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , while @xmath218 increases as @xmath215 decreases in the @xmath140 models , it stays almost constant ( actually somewhat decreases ) in model fpc5 .",
    "consequently , @xmath215 decreases to a much lower value in fpc5 .",
    "a comparison with the @xmath0-body model in figure 5b supports @xmath140 rather than @xmath214 .",
    "figure 6 shows the mass - density profiles of models nb ( left ) and fpc1 ( right ) at selected epochs .",
    "the density profiles for the galaxies ( middle ) and the common halo ( bottom ) are plotted separately as well as the total density ( top ) . for model nb , the density profiles of the galaxies are rather noisy because of the small number of galaxies",
    ". we should note that a comparison of the profiles of the @xmath0-body and fp models on a length scale of @xmath220 is , at least for the galaxies , meaningless , since the sizes of the galaxies , @xmath44 , is @xmath198 .",
    "thus , for @xmath221 in the @xmath0-body model , we see the internal structure of a galaxy if any galaxy is there , and a void if not . at late epochs , the central region of the cluster",
    "is usually occupied by a few massive galaxies that have sunk there owing to dynamical friction . for @xmath222 , models nb and fpc1 show very similar evolution of the density profiles , apart from fluctuations in the @xmath0-body model .    the similarity between the two models is more clearly shown in figure 7 , which directly compares their density profiles at @xmath223 .",
    "in particular , almost perfect agreement is seen in the density profile of the common halo .",
    "the agreement between the fp and @xmath0-body results shown above is enough to convince us that our fp models include all essential physical processes concerned and can describe the cluster evolution rather accurately .    in figure 8",
    "we show the logarithmic density gradient , @xmath3 [ see equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ] , as a function of the radius for model fpc1 at @xmath223 , together with the density profiles of fpc1 and nb again . for @xmath224 , the value of @xmath3 for the total density varies gently with the radius from @xmath225 to @xmath226 with a median value of @xmath198 .",
    "this implies that the total density profile in this region may be reasonably approximated by a power law , @xmath227 , as sfm99 claimed .",
    "the common halo component dominates the density for @xmath228 . for @xmath221",
    ", the density of the galaxy component overwhelms that of the halo component in the @xmath0-body model , while they are comparable in model fpc1 .",
    "as noted above , this difference arises because in the @xmath0-body model a massive galaxy stays around the cluster center at late epochs and its internal structure is observed on this length scale . in fact , the density of the particles in each galaxy is much larger than the density of the common halo particles for @xmath221 in nb .",
    "this extra density increase in the @xmath0-body model strengthens our impression that the total density profile is given by a power law .    it is not clear from figure 8 whether the central density distribution is really described by any single power law , since the central density has not yet increased sufficiently from the initial value . in principle , fp calculations can be ( formally ) continued further , if we neglect the fact that the galaxies have finite sizes .",
    "however , we could actually not continue fp calculations to very advanced stages of core collapse for model fpc1 and other similar models , unlike the case for the models without stripping , owing to numerical instability .",
    "this difficulty of fp calculations is linked to the divergence of the distribution function at the center caused by continuous decrease in the central velocity dispersion ; see section [ sec : r2 ] .    in order to see the mass dependence of the galaxy distributions , we divided the galaxies into four mass groups , @xmath229 $ ] , @xmath230 $ ] , @xmath231 $ ] , and @xmath232 $ ] , and plotted the density profile for each group for model fpc1 at @xmath223 in figure 9 .",
    "it is apparent that heavy galaxies are strongly depleted in the central regions , owing to tidal stripping , and have a very flat density profile .",
    "if there were no stripping , the heavy galaxies would dominate the central regions as the result of two - body relaxation .",
    "the development of `` inverse mass segregation '' is clearly shown in figure 10 , which plots the mass - weighted mean galaxy mass , @xmath233 , as a function of the radius for model fpc1 . the mean mass decreases toward the center .",
    "this indicates that mass stripping is more efficient than dynamical friction for heavy galaxies . only at very late epochs ( @xmath234 ) , when the central density of the galaxies has increased sufficiently high , is a slight increase in the mean mass seen at the center .",
    "similar inverse mass segregation was already found by funato et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and sfm99 in @xmath0-body simulations and by merritt ( 1984 ) in fp simulations .",
    "the density profiles of models fpc1c6 are similar , if they are compared at epochs with the same central density .",
    "in particular , the halo density profiles are almost indistinguishable .",
    "however , we show in the next section that the density cusp gradient does depend on the stripping rate .",
    "it is obvious that the gradient , @xmath3 , should be close to 2.2 when mass stripping is almost negligible compared to two - body relaxation . on the other hand , if stripping is infinitely fast , all galaxies will dissolve instantaneously and no further evolution of the cluster can occur based on our present assumptions .",
    "the stripping rates for models fpc1c6 are not very different ( see figures 4 and 5 ) , and hence the difference in their density profiles is insignificant .",
    "in subsection [ sec : r1.3 ] we showed that a shallow density cusp , approximated by @xmath235 , develops in the central regions of a galaxy cluster .",
    "now let us assume that a collapsing core leaves behind a cusp that exactly follows a power - law , @xmath184 .",
    "this implies that the central density grows as @xmath236 , as the core radius @xmath237 decreases with time .",
    "similarly , a dimensional analysis implies that the central velocity dispersion changes as @xmath238 ( but this is valid only for @xmath239 as we discuss later ) .",
    "this relation predicts that the central velocity dispersion increases ( i.e. the core gets hotter ) as the core shrinks if @xmath5 , and that it decreases ( i.e. the core gets cooler ) if @xmath240 . for core collapse in star clusters , detailed numerical calculations (",
    "cohn 1980 ; lynden - bell , eggleton 1980 ) show that @xmath241 , and that actually both the central density and velocity dispersion increase as the core shrinks  `` hot collapse '' occurs . for core collapse in galaxy clusters ,",
    "our calculations indicate @xmath240 .",
    "therefore , we expect `` cool collapse '' in this case .",
    "lynden - bell and eggleton ( 1980 ) proved that @xmath3 should be in the range @xmath242 for the existence of any self - similar collapse solution in equal - mass clusters .",
    "the condition @xmath243 comes from the requirement that temperature must decrease outward so that the core can shrink by losing heat to the halo . in multimass clusters , however , heat is also transferred among different mass components .",
    "therefore , it can happen that the core of heavy particles loses energy to light particles and shrinks even if @xmath240 .",
    "let us see in more detail the case of a shallow density cusp , @xmath244 this produces a potential , @xmath245 , that is finite at the center and satisfies @xmath246 if we assume that the velocity distribution is isotropic ( this is not a bad assumption near the center ) , we find that the density distribution ( [ eq : rho.sc ] ) corresponds to the distribution function @xmath247^{-(6-\\alpha)/2(2-\\alpha)}.   \\label{eq : df.sc}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath85 diverges as @xmath248 .",
    "this divergence causes difficulty in numerical integration of the fp equation , and therefore we had to stop our calculations at relatively early ( low central density ) collapse phases for the models with mass stripping .",
    "the depth of the central potential well becomes shallower as @xmath3 decreases ( tremaine et al .",
    "1994 ) .    as is argued by tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the dependence of the velocity dispersion , @xmath120 , on the radius for the density cusp represented by equation ( [ eq : rho.sc ] ) changes at @xmath249 .",
    "we find @xmath250 which is the equation expected from a dimensional analysis .",
    "for @xmath251 , the behavior of the velocity distribution is more subtle , since it is dominated by high - energy parts of the distribution function , which must deviate from equation ( [ eq : df.sc ] ) if the total mass is to be finite .",
    "if we consider any finite - mass model , we find @xmath252 ( see also dehnen 1993 ) .",
    "for any @xmath240 , @xmath253 as @xmath254 , and hence cool core collapse is expected .    in figure 11",
    "we plot the evolution of the central densities and the central velocity dispersions of the galaxy and common halo components for models fpa1 and fpc1 . here",
    "the velocity dispersion of the galaxies is the mass - weighted average over all the galaxies .",
    "the central density increases with time in both models , but the behavior of the velocity dispersion is very different between fpa1 and fpc1 .",
    "as we expected , the central velocity dispersion of the galaxies does decrease as core collapse proceeds in model fpc1 , while it increases in model fpa1 . in model fpc1 ,",
    "even the central velocity dispersion of the common halo finally decreases when core collapse accelerates .",
    "it is considered that this is because cool halo particles are being supplied from cool central galaxies .",
    "( remember we assumed that the particles stripped from a galaxy initially have the same energy and angular momentum per unit mass as those of its parent galaxy . )",
    "we now consider why the velocity dispersion of the galaxies continue to decrease when mass stripping is included .",
    "spitzer ( 1969 ) showed that equipartition among different mass components can not be achieved if self - gravity of heavy components is strong .",
    "it is instructive to recall here his simple model .",
    "consider a spherical system composed of particles of two different masses , @xmath114 and @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "we assume that the total mass of the light component is much larger than that of the heavy component , @xmath257 , and that the heavy component is concentrated at the center .",
    "then , the virial theorem for component 2 can be written as @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the mean velocity dispersion for component 2 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 are the median radii of components 1 and 2 , respectively , and @xmath262 and @xmath263 are numerical constants .",
    "_ for fixed @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath260 , _ the right side has a minimum value of @xmath266 at @xmath267 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath268 exists because the heavy particles form a self - gravitating system by themselves when @xmath269 , but behave as a non - self - gravitating system when @xmath270 .",
    "therefore , after the concentration of the heavy component becomes sufficiently high , its velocity dispersion increases as the heavy component loses energy and contracts . however , if we now allow @xmath265 to change with @xmath271 fixed , we find that @xmath272 and @xmath273 as @xmath274 .",
    "this implies that the velocity dispersion of the heavy component can continue to decrease to zero as the core shrinks , if mass stripping proceeds at an appropriate speed .",
    "mass stripping prevents the heavy component from forming an independent self - gravitating system .",
    "we may expect that core collapse changes its nature from cool collapse to hot collapse as tidal stripping becomes less and less important compared with two - body relaxation . to confirm this , we ran models fpc7 , c8 , and c9 , which are the same as model fpc1 but have @xmath213 2.5 , 0.25 , and 0.025 , respectively . in principle , we should change the initial models of galaxies and clusters rather than @xmath72 , which is considered to be roughly constant , in order to see the evolution of clusters with different stripping importance . from equation ( [ eq : ttstdf ] ) we find that stripping becomes less important as @xmath275 increases with",
    "the other parameters fixed .",
    "thus , very low stripping rates imply the condition @xmath276 .",
    "( cf . in star clusters",
    "the escape velocity from a star is much larger than the velocity dispersion of stars . )",
    "however , we should not directly apply the equations for tidal stripping presented in subsections 2.2 and 2.3 to such cases , since those equations are considered to be valid only for @xmath277 . we therefore choose to change @xmath72 just to conveniently control the stripping efficiency in our theoretical experiments .",
    "figure 12 shows the growth of the common halo mass for models fpc1 and fpc7c9 .",
    "it is interesting that the difference in the growth rates at the late times is within an order of magnitude among these models ( @xmath278[dm_{\\rm h}/dt ] \\sim$]0.03 , 0.08 , 0.05 , and 0.01 for fpc1 , c7 , c8 , and c9 , respectively ) , while @xmath72 varies over three orders of magnitude .",
    "this may be explained by a kind of self - regulation mechanism : if @xmath72 is large , the galaxies quickly become more compact through initial violent stripping , and then the stripping speed slows down ; if @xmath72 is small , the central density can increase to very high values , and this finally increases the stripping rate at the central regions .",
    "figure 13 shows the evolution of the central density and velocity dispersion of the galaxy component for models fpc1 and fpc7c9 .",
    "the transition from cool collapse to hot collapse occurs at @xmath279 . in model",
    "fpc8 the central velocity dispersion increases until the central density increases by about a factor of @xmath280 , but decreases after that .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ttstdf ] ) tells us that in the present models the stripping time eventually becomes shorter than the relaxation time as @xmath87 increases toward infinity .",
    "thus , we expect that for any small value of @xmath72 , tidal stripping will become effective and the velocity dispersion will begin to decrease when the velocity dispersion has increased to a critical value , which is inversely proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "the above results show that , unless the stripping rate is decreased to a very low value compared to the standard value , cool collapse occurs . therefore , under the conditions of real galaxy clusters ( @xmath281 ) , cool collapse is expected to occur .",

    "fpc9 a deep cusp of @xmath243 develops , and @xmath3 approaches 2.2 as the core collapse proceeds .",
    "unlike in no - stripping models fpa , the central density of the halo component also significantly rises in model fpc9 due to continuous production of new halo particles .",
    "figures 16a and b show the evolution of velocity dispersion profiles for models fpc7 and",
    "fpc9 , respectively . in these figures qualitative difference between models fpc7 and fpc9 is clearly seen . in model fpc7",
    "an inverse velocity dispersion gradient develops in the central regions .",
    "in this study , we investigated the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters after virialization using fp models and compared these models with the @xmath0-body models of sfm99 and sfm00 .",
    "our fp models included the effects of gravitational two - body encounters between galaxies and between galaxies and common halo particles which are much lighter than the galaxies .",
    "furthermore , tidal stripping of mass from the galaxies to the common halo and accompanying dissipation of the orbital kinetic energies of the galaxies were included using revised cross - section formulae .",
    "we found that the results of the fp models agree very well with those of the @xmath0-body models regarding the growth of the common halo mass and the evolution of the cluster density profiles .",
    "this indicates that all of the important physical processes that occur in the @xmath0-body models are properly included in the fp models .",
    "although there is some ambiguity in the cross sections of mass stripping and energy dissipation , we found that the results of the fp simulations do not sensitively depend on the details of the cross - section formulae .    in the evolution of galaxy clusters ,",
    "tidal mass stripping from galaxies is very important . under the initial conditions that sfm99 and",
    "sfm00 employed , where the total cluster mass is initially attached to galaxies , more than half of the total mass turns into the common halo during a first few crossing times .",
    "heavy galaxies sink toward the cluster center owing to dynamical friction .",
    "however , a high density of galaxies results in strong stripping , and thus it is usually seen in our models that the mean mass of galaxies decreases toward the center , which is inverse mass segregation .",
    "dissipation of the orbital kinetic energies of galaxies due to tidal stripping also plays an important role in accelerating the sinking of the galaxies toward the cluster center , if the velocity dispersion of the stars in the galaxies is not very small compared to that of the galaxies in the cluster .    as the central density increases , a cusp profile , approximated by a power law , @xmath184 , develops at the core region . in the model clusters of sfm99 and sfm00 , @xmath3 for the total density",
    "is @xmath2841 .",
    "this density distribution consists of the galaxy component with larger @xmath3 ( still @xmath285 ) and the common halo component with smaller @xmath3 .",
    "the development of the density cusp is a consequence of the collisional evolution of galaxy clusters .",
    "the slope of the density cusp , @xmath3 , depends on the ratio of the stripping rate to the relaxation rate .",
    "when the effect of stripping is negligible compared to relaxation , `` hot core collapse '' , which is usual gravothermal collapse , occurs : i.e. , as the core shrinks both the central density and velocity dispersion increase , and a deep cusp with @xmath286 develops .",
    "when stripping is important , `` cool core collapse '' occurs : while the central density increases , the central velocity dispersion decreases , and consequently a shallow cusp ( @xmath240 ) develops .",
    "faster tidal stripping results in shallower cusps . under the conditions of real galaxy clusters , tidal",
    "stripping is rather effective and cool collapse is expected to occur .",
    "one might think that this conclusion is in contradiction with the results of sfm00 , who showed using @xmath0-body simulations that the profile with @xmath287 ( 11.5 ) develops regardless of the initial models of galaxies and clusters .",
    "actually , their results are consistent with the results of this paper .",
    "sfm00 varied the initial models of galaxies and clusters adopting plummer , king ( king 1966 ) , and hernquist models ( hernquist 1990 ) , but did not vary the number of galaxies and the ratio of the galaxy virial radius to the cluster virial radius . as a result",
    ", the growth rates of the common halo mass , or the mean stripping rates are similar among all of their runs .",
    "our fp simulations show that while @xmath3 depends on the stripping rate , it does so only weakly .",
    "therefore , it is no wonder that no significant difference in @xmath3 has been detected among the @xmath0-body models of sfm00 .",
    "hot core collapse terminates with the formation of hard binaries . because of subsequent energy release from these binaries ,",
    "the core starts to expand ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1987 ) . what is the end state of cool collapse ?",
    "through cool collapse , low - energy galaxies accumulate around the cluster center .",
    "they finally merge and form a massive central galaxy .",
    "the central galaxy will further grow by eating galaxies falling to the center in succession , and this process will continue until all galaxies , except for the central one , disappear .",
    "thus , we will see at last one giant ( cd ? ) galaxy with an enormous halo . in the present study",
    "we did not include the merging process in fp models , and hence we could not follow very late stages of the cluster evolution with fp models .",

    "<S> we investigated the dynamical evolution of clusters of galaxies in virial equilibrium using fokker  planck models and self - consistent @xmath0-body models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focused on the growth of a common halo , which is a cluster - wide halo formed by matter stripped from galaxies , and the development of a central density cusp . </S>",
    "<S> the fokker  </S>",
    "<S> planck models include the effects of two - body gravitational encounters both between galaxies and between galaxies and common halo particles . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of tidal mass stripping from the galaxies due to close galaxy  galaxy encounters and accompanying dissipation of the orbital kinetic energies of the galaxies were also taken into account in the fokker  planck models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the results of the fokker  planck models are in excellent agreement with those of the @xmath0-body models regarding the growth of the common halo mass and the evolution of the cluster density profiles . in the central region of the cluster , a shallow density cusp , approximated by @xmath1 ( @xmath2 1 ) , develops . </S>",
    "<S> this shallow cusp results from the combined effects of two - body relaxation and tidal stripping . </S>",
    "<S> the cusp steepness , @xmath3 , weakly depends on the relative importance of the tidal stripping . </S>",
    "<S> when the effect of stripping is important , the central velocity dispersion decreases as the central density increases and , consequently , a shallow ( @xmath4 ) cusp is formed . in the limit of no stripping , </S>",
    "<S> usual gravothermal core collapse occurs , i.e. the central velocity dispersion increases as the central density increases with a steep ( @xmath5 ) cusp left . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from our consideration of the origin of the cusp demonstrated here that shallow cusps should develop in real galaxy clusters . </S>"
