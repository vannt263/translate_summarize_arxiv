    "it is a great honor and pleasure for me to contribute to this celebration of the scientific life work and achievements of abner shimony , from whom i have received much inspiration , personal encouragement and the gift of friendship in a decisive period of my scientific career . when i came to know abner more closely , i was thrilled to realize the close agreement between our quantum mechanical world views ; and ever since , when contemplating foundational issues , i found myself often wonder :  what would abner say ? \" .",
    "i am proud to share with abner one piece of work on an important item of  unfinished business \" , a paper on the insolubility of the quantum measurement problem @xcite , which i hope may prove useful as a stepping stone towards resolving this problem . in this contribution",
    "i will address another area of concern to abner , one that remains even when the measurement problem is suspended : quantum limitations of measurements .    by way of introduction of terminology and notation",
    "i briefly review the basic and most general probabilistic structures of quantum mechanics , encoded in the concepts of states , effects and observables ; i then recall how these objects enter the modeling of measurements ( section [ sec : mmt ] ) .",
    "this general framework of quantum measurement theory will then be used to obtain precise formulations and proofs of some long - disputed limitations of quantum measurements , such as the inevitability of disturbance and entanglement in a measurement , the impossibility of repeatable measurements for continuous quantities , and the incompatibility between conservation laws and the notion of repeatable sharp measurements ( section [ sec : qu - lim ] ) . in section [ sec : cu ] the _  classic \" _ quantum limitations expressed by the complementarity and uncertainty principles are revisited .",
    "appropriate operational measures of inaccuracy and disturbance for the formulation of quantitative trade - off relations for ( joint ) measurement inaccuracies and disturbances have been introduced in recent years ; these will be discussed in section [ sec : inacc - dist ] .",
    "i conclude with an outlook on open questions ( section [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "every quantum system is represented by a finite or infinite - dimensional , separable hilbert space @xmath0 over the complex field @xmath1 .",
    "states are described as positive operators or equivalently @xmath2 we denote the usual ordering of self - adjoint operators ; thus , @xmath3",

    "linguistic balance between the authors was maintained by taking @xmath11 to denote the pointer (  zeiger \" ) observable in a measurement scheme ( see below ) .",

    "the set of states @xmath13 is a convex subset of the real vector space of all self - adjoint trace - class operators .",
    "the role of a quantum state is to assign a probability to the outcome of any measurement ; in other words , associated with every measurement with possible outcomes @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are mappings @xmath16 $ ] assigning the probabilities @xmath17 . since mixtures of states lead to the corresponding mixtures of probabilities , it follows that the mappings @xmath18 are affine and hence extend uniquely to bounded positive linear mappings .",

    "measurements are physical processes and as such they are subject to the laws of physics . in quantum mechanics , a measurement performed on an isolated object is described as an interaction between this object system and an apparatus system , both being treated as quantum systems .",
    "being a macroscopic system , the apparatus will interact with a wider environment , but it is often convenient and sufficient to subsume the degrees of freedom of this  rest of the world \" into the description of the apparatus .    the quantum description of a measurement is succinctly summarized in the notion of a _ measurement scheme _ , i.e. , a quadruple @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the hilbert space of the apparatus ( or probe ) system , @xmath45 the initial apparatus state",
    ", @xmath46 is the unitary operator representing the time evolution and ensuing coupling between the object system and apparatus during the period of measurement from time @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "finally , @xmath11 is the apparatus pointer observable , usually modeled as a sharp observable .",
    "a schematic sketch of a measurement process is given in figure [ mmt - scheme ] which is taken from @xcite .",

    "it is understood that upon reading an outcome , symbolized in the diagram with a discrete label @xmath50 , the apparatus is considered to be describable in terms of a pointer eigenstate @xmath51 , and this determines uniquely the associated final state @xmath52 of the object , as will be shown below .",
    "the observable measured by such a scheme is determined by the pointer statistics for every object input state and is thus represented by a povm @xmath53 that is unambiguously defined by the following _ probability reproducibility _ condition : @xmath54}=:{\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { t\\,e(x ) } \\right]}\\equiv{\\mathsf{p}}^e_t(x).\\ ] ] here @xmath29 is any element of a @xmath30-algebra @xmath31 of subsets of an outcome space @xmath32 .",

    "note that these maps @xmath62 extend in a unique way to linear maps on the complex vector space of trace class operators .",
    "the above equation shows that every instrument defines a unique povm .",
    "an important property of the operations @xmath62 deriving from a measurement scheme is their _ complete positivity _ : for every @xmath63 , the linear map defined by @xmath64 ( where @xmath8 is any trace class operator on @xmath0 and @xmath65 is any trace class operator on @xmath66 ) is positive , that is , it sends state operators to ( generally non - normalized ) state operators .",

    "the instrument composed of the completely positive operations is also called completely positive .",
    "every measurement scheme defines thus a unique completely positive instrument , and the latter fixes a unique povm which represents the observable measured by the scheme .",
    "starting from ground - breaking mathematical work of neumark and stinespring , the converse statement was developed in increasing generality by ludwig and collaborators , davies and lewis , and ozawa ( detailed references can be found in @xcite ) :    [ thm : fund - qtm ] + every observable , represented as a povm @xmath53 , admits infinitely many completely positive instruments @xmath70 from which it arises via eq .",

    "next i recall some model realizations of measurement schemes and completely positive instruments ; these will provide valuable case studies in subsequent sections .      on the final pages of his famous book of 1932 , _",
    " mathematische grundlagen der quantenmechanik \" _ , von neumann introduces a mathematical model of what he describes as a measurement of the position of a particle in one spatial dimension .",
    "both the particle and measurement probe are represented by the hilbert spaces @xmath71 ; and the coupling @xmath72 generates a correlation between the observable intended to be measured , @xmath73 , and the pointer observable @xmath74 . denote the selfadjoint canonical position and momentum operators , and their spectral measures are denoted @xmath75 , respectively . ] to simplify the calculations , one assumes that the interaction is _ impulsive _ , that is , the coupling constant is large so that the duration of the interaction can be kept small enough so as to neglect the free hamiltonians of the two systems .",
    "it is further assumed that the initial state of the probe is a pure state , @xmath76}$ ] , with @xmath77 and finite variance @xmath78 .",
    "von neumann proceeded to calculate the correlation between the particle s position and the pointer observable _ after _ the coupling period and took this _ measure of repeatability _ as an indication of the quality of the measurement .",
    "had he made the computation associated with equation ( [ eqn : prob - rep ] ) above , he would have found the actually measured observable to be a _ smeared position _",
    "observable @xmath79:@xmath80 here @xmath81 denotes the convolution .",

    "the second term in the expression for the variance , @xmath86 , indicates the unsharpness of the observable @xmath79 and at the same time is a measure of the inaccuracy of the measurement , that is , the separation between @xmath73 and @xmath79 .",
    "the instrument induced by von neumann s measurement scheme is given as follows : @xmath87      it turned out much more intricate to find a measurement scheme realizing a measurement of the sharp position observable .",
    "one solution was presented by ozawa @xcite who introduced the following coupling : @xmath88\\\\ & = \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac i\\hbar{q}\\otimes{p}_{\\mathcal{a}}\\right)\\ , \\exp\\left(\\tfrac i\\hbar{p}\\otimes{q}_{\\mathcal{a}}\\right ) .",

    "the formalism of quantum measurements reviewed above provides a framework for the rigorous formulation of limitations on the measurability of physical quantities arising from quantum structures .",
    "there has been much debate over the claim that according to quantum theory , every measurement necessarily  disturbs \" the object system .",
    "here is a theorem that states a precise sense in which this claim is true .",
    "there is no instrument that leaves unchanged all states of the system unless the associated observable is trivial . more precisely : if an instrument @xmath70 on @xmath36 satisfies @xmath92 for all @xmath93 , then @xmath94}=:\\lambda(x)$ ] is a constant map for all @xmath95 , and so the induced observable @xmath53 is trivial , @xmath96 .    the proof is quickly sketched : if @xmath97}\\mapsto{{\\mathcal i}}_\\omega({p[{\\varphi}]})={{\\mathcal i}}_x ( { p[{\\varphi}]})+{{\\mathcal i}}_{\\omega\\setminus x}({p[{\\varphi}]})={p[{\\varphi}]}$ ] , then @xmath98})=\\lambda(x){p[{\\varphi}]}$ ] . due to the linearity of @xmath62 , the term",

    "hence a measurement scheme with no state change yields no information gain .",
    "we note that  disturbance \" has here been interpreted as state change .",
    "this conclusion immediately leads to another question : is it possible to restrict the quality or accuracy of a measurement and thereby control the extent of the disturbance ?",
    "this will be addressed in section [ sec : inacc - dist ] .",
    "it is a general fact of quantum mechanics that interactions between two systems lead to _ entanglement _ between them , that is , to states which are not of product form .",
    "from this it would seem to follow that in a measurement the object system and apparatus end up necessarily in an entangled state at the end of the coupling period .",

    "it follows that if one aims at constructing a measurement scheme that leaves the object and apparatus in a non - entangled ( separable ) state after the coupling , and if this measurement is to transfer information about the initial object state @xmath113 to the apparatus , then the coupling @xmath106 must act as in ( b ) .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that after a suitable coupling interaction has been applied , the object and apparatus are left in an non - entangled state and yet complete information about the object state has been transferred to the apparatus .",
    "however , due to the continuity of the unitary dynamical evolution @xmath114 which comprises the coupling operator @xmath115 , not all @xmath116 with @xmath117 can be of the non - entangling form ( b ) , since that operator is not continuously connected with the identity operator @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "it follows that that some intermittent entanglement must build up during the interval @xmath120 $ ] .    in order to extend this proof to measurement schemes for which the initial apparatus state@xmath45 is not pure ,",
    "it is necessary to sharpen the no - entanglement condition of the theorem to hold for any vector in @xmath121 whose projection operator can arise as a convex component of @xmath45 .",
    "these vectors are known to be given exactly by those in the range of @xmath122 @xcite .",

    "iv.3 ) it was shown that this resolution amounts to describing the measurement by means of a povm with three possible outcomes and associated effects @xmath176 , where the effects @xmath177 , i.e. , they are  close to \" the spectral projections of @xmath178 if @xmath179 , and the effect @xmath180 is a multiple of @xmath22 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath181 can be made very small if the size of the measuring system is large .",
    "these considerations show that it is a matter of principle that measurements of spin can never be perfectly accurate as a consequence of the additive conservation law for total angular momentum .",
    "the the necessary inaccuracy is appropriately described by a povm of the kind described above . however , the common description of a sharp spin measurement is found to be an admissible idealization ; the error made by breaking ( ignoring ) the fundamental rotation symmetry of the measurement hamiltonian is negligible due to the fact that the measuring system is very large .",
    "it seems to be a difficult problem to decide whether a limitation of measurability arises also in cases where the observable to be measured and the conserved quantity are unbounded and have continuous spectra .",
    "this question was raised by shimony and stein in 1979 @xcite .",
    "the most general result at that time was the following ( expressed in the notation of the present paper ) :    [ thm : mmt - cons - law ] if a sharp observable @xmath53 admits a repeatable measurement , and if @xmath182 is a bounded selfadjoint operator representing a conserved quantity for the combined object and apparatus system , then @xmath53 commutes with @xmath183 .",
    "since repeatable measurements exist only for discrete observables ( theorem [ thm : rep - disc ] ) , the above statement is only applicable to object observables with discrete spectra .",
    "hence it does not apply to measurements of position .",
    "ozawa @xcite presented what seems to be a counter example , using a coupling that is manifestly translation invariant .",
    "however , this model constitutes an unsharp position measurement which becomes a sharp measurement only if the initial state of the apparatus is allowed to be a non - normalizable state ( that is , not a hilbert space vector or state operator ) . a proof that a sharp position measurement ( without repeatability , but with some additional physically reasonable assumptions )",
    "can not be reconciled with momentum conservation was given in @xcite .",
    "a general proof is still outstanding .",
    "here we use another modification of the von neumann model to demonstrate that momentum conservation is compatible with unsharp position measurements where the inaccuracy can be made arbitrarily small ( * ? ? ? * sec .",

    "then the measured observable is the smeared position @xmath186 , where @xmath187 .",
    "one can argue that the clash between the conservation law and position measurement has been shifted and reappears when the measurement of @xmath188 is considered .",
    "however , if momentum conservation is taken into account in the measurement of the pointer , it would turn out that the pointer itself is only measured approximately , that is , an unsharp pointer @xmath189 is actually measured , which then yields the measured observable as @xmath190 .    the lesson of the current subsection is this : to the extent that the limitation on measurability due to additive conservation laws holds as a general theorem , it shows that the notion of a sharp measurement of the most important quantum observables is an idealization which can be realized only approximately _ as a matter of principle _ ; yet the quality of the approximation can be extremely good due to the macroscopic nature of the measuring apparatus .    to conclude this section , it is worth remarking that the quantum limitations of measurements described here are valid independently of the view that one may take on the measurement problem .",
    "this is the case because these limitations follow from consideration of the total state of system and apparatus as it arises in the course of its unitary evolution .",
    "the _  classic \" _ expressions of quantum limitations of preparations and measurements are codified in the complementarity and uncertainty principles , formulated by bohr and heisenberg 80 years ago .",

    "the _ complementarity principle _ is the statement that there are pairs of observables which stand in the relationship of complementarity .",
    "that relationship comes in two variants , stating the mutual exclusivity of _ preparations _ or _ measurements _ of certain pairs of observables . in quantum mechanics",

    "this means that the system is in an eigenstate of one observable , so that the value of that observable can be predicted with certainty , the values of the other observable are uniformly distributed .",
    "this feature is an instance of _ preparation complementarity _ , and it has been called _",
    "value complementarity_. _ measurement complementarity _ of observables with mutually unbiased eigenbases can be characterized by the following property : any attempt to obtain simultaneous information about both observables by first measuring one and then the other is bound to fail since the first measurement completely destroys any information about the other observable ; that is to say , the second measurement gives no information about the state prior to the first measurement .",
    "this will be illustrated in an example below .",
    "we conclude that the  principle \" of complementarity , as formalized here , is in fact a consequence of the quantum mechanical formalism .",
    "examples of pairs of observables are spin-1/2 observables such as @xmath191 , and the canonically conjugate position and momentum observables @xmath192 of a free particle . a unified formalization of preparation and measurement complementarity can be given in terms of the spectral projections of these observables ( @xmath193 for @xmath191 , and @xmath194 for @xmath192 : @xmath195 the symbol @xmath196 represents the lattice - theoretic infimum of two projections , that is , for example , @xmath197 is the projection onto the closed subspace which is the intersection of the ranges of @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "these relations entail , in particular , that complementary pairs of observables do not possess joint probability distributions associated with a state @xmath8 in the usual way : for example , there is no povm @xmath200 such that @xmath201 and @xmath202 for all @xmath203 .",

    "let @xmath212 be the repeatable ( von neumann - lders ) instrument associated with @xmath6 : @xmath213 .",

    "the associated measured observable is indeed the sharp observable @xmath73 since @xmath228}={\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { t{\\mathsf{q}}(x ) } \\right]}$ ] .",

    "notice that this form is in fact realized in the ozawa instrument for a sharp position measurement , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ozawa - instr ] ) .",
    "while we have not shown that this form is necessary , this consideration suggests that for approximately repeatable position measurements a subsequent momentum measurement leads to a ( nearly ) trivial observable as the distorted momentum .      following ref .",
    "@xcite , we propose that the term _ uncertainty principle _ refers to the broad statement that there are pairs of observables for which a trade - off relationship pertains for the degrees of sharpness of the preparation or measurement of their values , such that a simultaneous or sequential determination of the values requires a nonzero amount of unsharpness ( latitude , inaccuracy , disturbance ) .",
    "this gives rise to _ three _ variants of uncertainty relations , exemplified here for position and momentum : first there is the well - known inequality for the widths of the probability distributions of position and momentum in any quantum state that can be expressed in terms of the standard deviations , @xmath233 second , one may consider a trade - off relation for the inaccuracies in any attempted _ joint measurement _ of position and momentum , @xmath234 where the inaccuracies are to be defined appropriately as measures of the differences between the sharp position and momentum observables @xmath75 and their approximations @xmath235 , respectively , which are to be measured jointly .",
    "finally , there is a trade - off between the accuracy of an approximate measurement of position ( momentum ) and a necessary disturbance of the momentum ( position ) distribution : @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 denote appropriate measures of the disturbance of position and momentum , respectively .",
    "suitable measures of inaccuracy and disturbance which make the last two measurement uncertainty relations precise will be presented in section [ sec : inacc - dist ] .",
    "it thus turns out that similar to the complementarity principle , the uncertainty principle in its three manifestations is also a formal consequence of the noncommutativity of the observables in question .",
    "principle \" may still be used to highlight the fact that the uncertainty relations reflect an important nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics .",
    "the reviews @xcite and @xcite propose a resolution of a long - standing controversy over the relationship , relative roles and interplay of the complementarity and uncertainty principles .",
    "this resolution will be briefly summarized here . as indicated in the introductory quote from bohr ( 1928 ) ,",
    "the traditional view describes the uncertainty relations as a formal expression of the complementarity principle .",
    "however , as a quick survey of the research and textbook literature on quantum mechanics shows , this view has met with a considerable degree of uneasiness by many .",
    "some authors consistently avoid any reference to complementarity while others play down the significance of the uncertainty relations , denying them the status of a principle which they reserve for complementarity .    yet , in recent years there has been a shift of perspective which was indeed anticipated in the same quote of bohr : complementarity is seen as a statement of the _ impossibility _ of jointly performing certain pairs of preparation or measurement procedures , whereas the role of the uncertainty principle is to quantify the degree to which an approximate reconciliation of these mutually exclusive options becomes a _",
    "possibility_. it seems that in this way a more balanced assessment has been achieved : compared to the view that emphasized complementarity over uncertainty , the positive role of the uncertainty relations as enabling joint determinations and joint measurements is now highlighted more prominently ; and even though it is true ( as shown in @xcite ) that the uncertainty relations entail the complementarity relations in a suitable limit sense , it is still appropriate to point out the strict mutual exclusivity of sharp value assignments which , after all , is the reason for the quest for an approximate reconciliation in the form of simultaneous but unsharp value assignments .",
    "the principles of complementarity and uncertainty are extreme manifestations of the existence of noncommuting pairs of observables and of superpositions of states , which both entail fundamental limitations of the possibilities of preparing or measuring simultaneous sharp values of observables that do not commute .",
    "these limitations are consequences of a famous theorem of von neumann which we summarize here as follows .",
    "[ thm : vn ] let @xmath6 and @xmath57 be two sharp observables represented as selfadjoint operators .",

    "+ ( b ) @xmath6 and @xmath57 possess a joint observable that defines joint probabilities for them ( jointly measurability ) .",
    "+ ( c ) @xmath168 .    the reason for the long - standing debate over the superiority of either the complementarity _ principle _ or the uncertainty _ principle _ seems to lie in the fact that the _ features _ of complementarity and uncertainty are formally intertwined in hilbert space quantum mechanics .",
    "it is only in the context of theoretical frameworks more abstract and general than quantum or classical theories that the logical relationships between complementarity and uncertainty postulates can be investigated ; in such a generalized setting these postulates can in fact be used as principles within a set of axioms from which the hilbert space framework of quantum mechanics can be deduced .",
    "as an example , we note the work of p.  lahti together with the late s.  bugajski , ref .",
    "@xcite , who used appropriate formalizations of complementarity and the existence of von neuman - lders measurements in the so - called convexity framework to derive hilbert space quantum theory .",
    "it remains to show how the above programmatic statement of the uncertainty principle for joint and sequential measurements can be made precise by appropriate measures of inaccuracy and disturbance .",
    "such measures are also applicable in the analysis of the other quantum limitations of measurability discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qu - lim ] .",
    "first i will introduce the idea of an approximate joint measurement of two noncommuting quantities and present an operational definition of measurement error applicable to continuous observables such as position and momentum ; the error measures for these observables obey a trade - off relation valid in any approximate joint measurements .",
    "then i will show that a trade - off relation between the accuracy of a measurement and the disturbance of the distributions of an observable not commuting with the measured observable can be considered as an instance of a trade - off relation between the inaccuracies in an approximate joint measurement of two noncommuting observables .",
    "a necessary criterion for the joint measurability of two observables is the existence of a joint probability distribution for every state @xmath8 in the usual quantum mechanical form .",
    "von neumann s theorem entails that two noncommuting sharp observables such as position and momentum do not possess joint distributions ( for all states ) .",
    "hence these observables are not jointly measurable . however , for the joint measurability of pairs of _ unsharp _ observables , commutativity is _ not _ a necessary requirement .",

    "first , one needs to introduce suitable operational measures of inaccuracy , that is , of the deviation between two observables defined on the same outcome space @xmath36 .",
    "second , since we are interested in good joint approximations of noncommuting pairs of observables , the optimal approximators @xmath239 must be expected to be noncommuting and hence unsharp observables in order to be jointly measurable ; therefore , the problem arises to quantify the necessary degree of unsharpness required for the joint measurability given the finite  distance \" of @xmath239 from two noncommuting observables .",
    "the definition of such measures of inaccuracy and unsharpness will in general depend on the type of outcome space .",

    "a measure of measurement inaccuracy that would appear natural to an experimenter is the width of error bars , which is estimated in a process of calibration : the measurement scheme to be calibrated is fed with systems prepared with fairly sharply defined values of ( say ) the position observable . for each value ,",

    "then the noise of @xmath243 and the noise of @xmath244 obey the following inequality : @xmath298    an alternative measure of the intrinsic unsharpness of an observable on @xmath41 is given by the _ resolution width _",
    ", introduced in @xcite ; this quantity is similar in spirit to the error bar width , and it is again found to yield a universal trade - off relation in joint measurements @xcite .      we have seen that a momentum measurement following a sharp position measurement defines an observable that carries no information about the momentum distributions of the states prior to the position measurement .",
    "a sharp measurement of position thus destroys completely the momentum information contained in the initial state .",
    "the question arises whether the disturbance of momentum can be diminished if the position is measured approximately rather than sharply .",
    "this possibility was already envisaged by heisenberg in his discussion of thought experiments illustrating the uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of a particle passing through a slit he noted that due to the diffraction at the slit , an initially sharp momentum distribution is distorted into a broader distribution whose width @xmath299 is of the order @xmath300 , where @xmath301 is the width of the slit .",
    "the width @xmath299 is a measure of the change , or disturbance , of the momentum distribution , and @xmath301 can be interpreted as the inaccuracy of the position determination effected by the slit .",
    "further , one may also consider the recording of the location at which the particle hits the screen as a geometric determination of the ( direction ) of its momentum , the inaccuracy @xmath302 of which is given by the width @xmath299 of the distribution obtained after many repetitions of the experiment . in this way the passage through the slit followed by the recording at the screen constitutes an approximate joint measurement of the position and momentum of the particle at the moment of its passage through the slit",
    "; see figure [ fig : slit ] .",
    "( 100,120)(-50,100 )     generalizing this idea of making an approximate joint measurement by way of a sequence of approximate measurements , we consider the schemes of figures [ fig : sharp - seq ] and [ fig : unsharp - seq ] ) .",
    "here @xmath243 is either the sharp position @xmath73 or an unsharp position observable @xmath79 measured first , followed by a sharp momentum observable , whose measurement is to be followed by a sharp momentum measurement .",
    "the observable @xmath244 effectively measured by this momentum measurement is defined via @xmath303 for all initial states @xmath8 , where @xmath304 is the state after the position measurement .",
    "thus @xmath244 is the  distorted \" momentum observable .",
    "collecting the probabilities for finding an outcome in a set @xmath29 for the first measurement and an outcome in @xmath305 for the second measurement defines a probability measure for each state @xmath8 via @xmath306 . hence there is a unique joint observable @xmath241 for @xmath243 and @xmath244 determined by the given measurement scheme @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "since the marginal @xmath307 is sharp , @xmath244 commutes with @xmath73 and is therefore _ not _ a good approximation of the momentum observable @xmath240 . however , in the second case , @xmath308 , it is known @xcite that the second marginal observable @xmath244 is a smeared momentum observable , @xmath309 , if the first , unsharp position measurement is such that the induced instrument is the von neumann instrument ( [ eqn : vn - instrum ] ) .",
    "the inaccuracy distributions are then related as follows ( cf .",
    "( [ eqn : smeared - pos ] ) ) : @xmath310 here @xmath311 is the fourier transform of @xmath312 , from which it follows that the standard deviations of the distributions @xmath313 obey the uncertainty relation : @xmath314 note that @xmath315 , @xmath316 are measures of how well the sharp observables @xmath75 are approximated by @xmath239 , respectively .",
    "thus they are measures of measurement inaccuracy , and at the same time @xmath316 quantifies the disturbance of the momentum distribution due to the position measurement .",

    "the inaccuracy of the second measurement , that is , any measure of the separation between @xmath240 and @xmath244 , is also a measure of the momentum disturbance .",
    "consequently , all the joint measurement inaccuracy relations discussed above apply to sequential joint measurements of position and momentum , and in this case they constitute rigorous versions of the long - sought - after inaccuracy - vs - disturbance trade - off relations .",
    "using the apparatus of modern quantum measurement theory , i have reviewed rigorous formulations of some well - known quantum limitations of measurements : the inevitability of disturbance and ( transient ) entanglement ; the impossibility of repeatable measurements for continuous quantities , the restrictions on measurements arising from the presence of an additive conserved quantity , and the necessarily approximate and unsharp nature of joint measurements of noncommuting quantities .    in each case , a strict no - go theorem is complemented with a positive result describing conditions for an approximate realization of the impossible goal : repeatability can be approximated arbitrarily well for continuous sharp observables , also in the presence of a conservation law .",
    "it was found that ideal measurements of sharp observables are necessarily repeatable , but in the case of unsharp observables , approximate ideality can be achieved without forcing approximate repeatability .",
    "thus , unsharp measurements may be less invasive than sharp measurements .",
    "the impossibility of joint sharp measurements of complementary pairs of observables can be modulated into the possibility of _ approximate _ joint measurements of such observables , _ provided _ the inaccuracies are allowed to obey a universal heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "likewise , the complete destruction of momentum information by a sharp position measurement can be avoided if an _ unsharp _",
    "position measurement is performed .",
    "the trade - off between the information gain in the approximate measurement of one observable and the disturbance of ( the distribution of ) its complementary partner observable was found to be an instance of the joint - measurement uncertainty relation .",
    "these results , some of which were made precise in very recent investigations , open up a range of interesting new questions and tasks .",
    "in particular , it will be important to find operational measures of inaccuracy that are applicable to all types of observables , whether bounded or unbounded , discrete or continuous .",
    "this would probably enable a formulation of a universal form of joint measurement uncertainty relation for arbitrary pairs of ( noncommuting ) observables , thus generalizing the relations presented here for the special case of complementary pairs of continuous observables such as position and momentum .",
