    "an explosion of infrared data on star formation regions is being collected by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ and will continue to be collected by future missions such as the _ herschel space observatory _ and the _ james webb space telescope_. despite its modest size ( @xmath4 m ) , the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ is much more sensitive and has higher spatial resolution than previous infrared observatories @xcite .",
    "it is also very efficient , and has mapped a substantial fraction of the star formation regions in the galaxy using the irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8@xmath3 m ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) instruments .",
    "for example , the glimpse @xcite and mipsgal ( pi carey ) legacy surveys are mapping over 150 square degrees of the inner galactic plane ; the cores - to - disks ( c2d ) legacy project has surveyed five nearby large molecular clouds @xcite ; and several projects are surveying the orion molecular cloud @xcite , the taurus molecular cloud @xcite , the lmc @xcite and smc , and many other well - known star formation regions ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these data can be combined with other surveys , such as the 2mass near - infrared all - sky survey @xcite , expanding the wavelength coverage of the observed ysos .",
    "our particular goal is to characterize ysos in the galaxy using the glimpse and mipsgal surveys , as well as in the lmc using the sage survey , and to determine the timescales of various evolutionary stages as a function of stellar mass and location in the galaxy .",
    "ultimately , we hope to provide an independent estimate of the star formation rate and efficiency in the galaxy and the lmc .    to help analyze the seds of ysos we developed radiation transfer models @xcite . the well - known classification for low - mass ysos uses the spectral index @xmath5 ( the slope of @xmath6 vs @xmath7 longward of @xmath8@xmath3 m ) to classify a source as embedded ( @xmath9 ; class  i ) , a disk source ( @xmath10 ; class  ii ) or a source with an optically thin or no disk ( @xmath11 ; class  iii ) @xcite",
    "however , our models indicate that the spectral index and the colors of a yso in certain wavelength ranges are not always directly related to its evolutionary stage . for example",
    ", an edge - on embedded protostar can have a decreasing slope in the narrow wavelength range of @xmath12@xmath3 m  if the flux is dominated by scattered light ( edge - on disks exhibit similar behavior , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the temperature of the central source also affects the colors in this wavelength range , as does the location of the inner radius of the disk : hot stellar sources and large inner disk holes can produce red colors in a star+disk source ( see section  [ s : color ] ) .    in an attempt to improve our physical understanding gained from interpreting the seds of the many sources found in these surveys , many of which only have jhk , irac , and mips 24@xmath3 m  data , we plan to fit observed seds using a large grid of pre - computed model seds .",
    "this grid attempts to encompass a large range of stellar masses and yso evolutionary stages .",
    "we sampled the model parameters based on both theory and observations ( see section [ s : params ] ) .",
    "this paper describes our publicly available grid of models . a companion paper ( robitaille et al . 2006 , in preparation ) describes the method used to fit observed seds using the grid of models .",
    "the advantages of fitting pre - computed seds to data , even in the fairly narrow wavelength range mentioned above , are that 1 ) one makes use of all available data simultaneously without loss of information 2 ) the uniqueness or non - uniqueness of a fit is immediately apparent from the range of model parameters that can fit a given sed , and 3 ) it is an efficient technique when used with large datasets as the model seds do not have to be computed for each source . in section  [ s : models ] we describe the grid of models .",
    "section  [ s : results ] shows results from the grid , including sample seds , polarization spectra , and color - color plots , as well as an analysis of spectral index and color - color plot classifications .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : conclusion ] we make concluding remarks .",
    "the monte carlo radiation transfer code used for this grid of models includes non - isotropic scattering , polarization , and thermal emission from dust in a spherical - polar grid , solving for the temperature using the method of @xcite .",
    "this code is publicly available .",
    "the circumstellar geometry consists of a rotationally - flattened infalling envelope @xcite , bipolar cavities @xcite and a flared accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the luminosity sources include the central star and disk accretion .",
    "the code and the model geometries are described in detail in @xcite .    as discussed in section  [ s : params ] , the various model parameters are sampled in order to produce a range of evolutionary stages . for example , the envelope accretion rate decreases over time , the bipolar cavities become wider , the dust in the cavities less dense , and the disk radius increases during the early accretion from the envelope .",
    "our grain models contain a mixture of astronomical silicates and graphite in solar abundance , using the optical constants of @xcite .",
    "the optical properties are averaged over the size distribution and composition .",
    "thus we do not separate the heating and emission properties of different grain sizes or composition .",
    "this could affect the thermal and chemical properties in the inner regions of the disk @xcite but its affect on the sed is expected to be relatively minor @xcite .",
    "the grain properties vary with location in the disk and envelope as follows : the densest regions of the disk ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) use a grain model with a size distribution that decays exponentially for sizes larger than 50@xmath3 m  and extends up to @xmath15 mm ; this grain model fits the sed of the hh30 disk @xcite .",
    "this is the same as the `` disk midplane '' grain model described in table  3 of @xcite .",
    "the rest of the circumstellar geometry uses a grain size distribution with an average particle size slightly larger than the diffuse ism , and a ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath16 .",
    "this is the `` kmh '' model @xcite , referred to as the `` outflow '' model in table  3 of @xcite .",
    "dust grains in embedded regions of taurus show evidence for further grain growth , with @xmath17 in the densest regions @xcite , but recent models of near - ir images of taurus protostars show that larger grain models are not well - distinguished from ism grains @xcite .",
    "grains in molecular clouds also show evidence for ice coatings ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are not included in our models .",
    "the spectrum of the central source for each model is dependent mainly on its temperature and to a lesser extent its surface gravity . for stellar temperatures below @xmath18k , we used model stellar photospheres from @xcite , while for stellar temperatures above @xmath18k we used model stellar photospheres from @xcite . in both cases we assumed solar metallicity",
    "for each yso model , we interpolated the stellar photospheres to the relevant temperature and surface gravity .",
    "technically speaking the set of models we present in this paper does not form a ` grid ' , since the parameters are randomly sampled within ranges .",
    "however , we will refer to the set of models as a ` model grid ' , since this is a useful descriptive term .",
    "the 14 model parameters are shown in table  [ t : parameters ] .",
    "fortunately , only a few parameters are important at a given evolutionary stage .",
    "for example in the youngest stages , the disk is hidden beneath the envelope : the disk inner radius , accretion rate , and to a lesser extent disk mass are the main disk parameters that affect the 1 - 8@xmath3 m  fluxes .",
    "the presence of an inner disk is required to produce mid - ir flux and to obscure the central source at edge - on viewing angles , but the dust properties in the disk and the amount of flaring do not have an important effect on the mid - ir sed . at these young stages ,",
    "the most important parameters are the envelope accretion rate , the opening angle of the bipolar cavities , the inclination to the line of sight , the disk / envelope inner radius , the stellar temperature , and to a lesser extent the disk mass . at later stages , when the envelope has mostly dispersed , the most relevant parameters for the sed are the disk inner radius , accretion rate , mass , and flaring ( or dust settling ) @xcite .",
    "the details of the parameter sampling are given in section  [ s : params ] .",
    "it is important to note at this point that we are not suggesting our own model of evolution for ysos .",
    "instead , our aim is to provide model seds for stages of evolution that have been suggested by theory or observations .",
    "furthermore , we do not follow several objects throughout their evolution , but instead we sample possible evolutionary stages and stellar masses randomly .",
    "the output from the code presented here consists of flux and polarization spectra for 250 wavelengths ( from @xmath19 to @xmath20@xmath3 m ) , computed at 10 viewing angles ( from pole - on to edge - on in equal intervals of cosine of the inclination ) and in 50 different circular apertures ( with radii from @xmath21 to @xmath22au ) .",
    "since each one of the 20,000 models produces an sed ( flux vs. wavelength ) for each viewing angle and aperture , our grid of models contains 10 million seds .",
    "the code can produce images at specific viewing angles , but we did not compute these in the current grid as doing so would increase the cpu time required .",
    "however , the 50 apertures from @xmath23au amount to a spherically averaged intensity profile for each viewing angle of each model .",
    "we have convolved all our models with a large number of common filter bandpasses ranging from optical to sub - mm wavelengths , including for example optical ( e.g. ubvri ) , near - ir ( e.g. 2mass jhk ) , mid- and far - ir ( e.g. irac , msx , iras , mips ) , and sub - mm ( e.g. scuba @xmath24 and @xmath25@xmath3 m ) filters .",
    "we will expand the range of filters used to convolve the seds as requested by users .",
    "the polarization spectra have a lower signal - to - noise than the seds , so we smooth them before convolving with broadband filter profiles .    for the grid of models presented here , we ran each model with 20,000,000 ` photons ' ( energy packets , * ? ? ?",
    "this produces seds with good signal - to - noise ratios for wavelengths spanning @xmath26@xmath3 m  ( however , we note that the signal - to noise may also be good outside this range ) .",
    "the wavelength range at which a model sed has a good signal - to - noise depends on the evolutionary stage of the yso : seds may be noisy at wavelengths shorter than @xmath15@xmath3 m  , but with a good signal - to noise at sub - mm wavelengths for young embedded sources , or be noisy and at wavelengths longer than about @xmath21@xmath3 m  and with a good signal - to - noise at optical and near - uv wavelengths for low mass disks .",
    "figure  [ f : quality ] shows the median noise levels as a function of wavelength ( using the seds measured in the largest aperture ) .",
    "we provide estimated uncertainties on our seds so that they are still usable in most wavelength ranges .",
    "the seds can be re - binned to a lower wavelength resolution to reduce these uncertainties .",
    "future versions of the grid will include higher signal - to - noise seds as well as images .    the time taken for each model to run varies with optical depth and covering factor of circumstellar material as seen from the radiation source .",
    "a disk model typically takes an hour to run on a 3 ghz intel processor , and an embedded protostar can take 10 hours .",
    "the total cpu time for the entire model grid , which was run on three different clusters , was approximately 65,000 hours ( or roughly three weeks using approximately 60 cpus ) .",
    "the grid of models is available on a dedicated web server .",
    "this includes seds and polarization spectra for each inclination and aperture of each model .",
    "various components of the sed can be viewed separately , such as the flux emitted by the disk , star , or envelope , the scattered flux , and the direct stellar flux , as described in section [ s : seds ] .",
    "fluxes and magnitudes for common filter functions are also available .      in the following section we present a detailed description of the parameter sampling .",
    "it is not possible to explore parameter space in its entirety in a completely unbiased manner .",
    "therefore we have had to make arbitrary decisions concerning the ranges of parameter values .",
    "the parameter ranges covered by the grid of models span those determined from observations and theories , and can be divided into three categories : the central source parameters ( stellar mass , radius and temperature ) , the infalling envelope parameters ( the envelope accretion rate , outer radius , inner radius , cavity opening angle and cavity density ) , and the disk parameters ( disk mass , outer radius , inner radius , flaring power , and scaleheight ) . also included is a parameter describing the ambient density surrounding the yso .",
    "all the masses , mass accretion rates and densities for the disk and envelope parameters assume a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath21 .",
    "note that the results can be scaled to different gas - to - dust ratios since only the dust is taken into account in the radiation transfer .",
    "for example , a disk with a total mass of @xmath19@xmath1 in a region where the gas - to - dust ratio is @xmath21 will produce the same sed as a disk with a total mass of @xmath0@xmath1 in a region where the gas - to - dust ratio is @xmath27 ( such as a low - metallicity galaxy or perhaps the outer milky way ) .",
    "in addition to disk masses , the following parameter values should be rescaled accordingly in regions where the gas - to - dust ratio is not @xmath21 : the envelope accretion rates , disk accretion rates , cavity densities and ambient densities .",
    "note that it is only necessary to re - scale the parameter values , and that it is not necessary to re - run the radiation transfer models      the parameters for the 20,000 yso models were chosen using the following procedure .",
    "first a stellar mass @xmath28 was randomly sampled from the following probability distribution function :    @xmath29    the masses were sampled between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this produced a constant density of models in @xmath32 space . following this ,",
    "a random stellar age @xmath33 was sampled from a similar probability distribution function :    @xmath34    the ages were sampled between @xmath35yr and @xmath36yr .",
    "this distribution produced a density of models close to constant in @xmath37 space , but with a slight bias towards larger values of @xmath33 .",
    "this was done to avoid a deficit of disk - only models . in cases where the resulting values of the stellar age were greater than the combined pre - main sequence and main - sequence lifetime of the star ( estimated from the sampled masses @xmath28 ) ,",
    "the age was resampled until it was within the adequate lifetime .",
    "the values of @xmath28 and @xmath33 for the 20,000 models are shown in figure  [ f : agemstar ] .",
    "for each set of @xmath28 and @xmath33 the values of the stellar radius @xmath38 and temperature @xmath39 were found by interpolating pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks ( @xcite for @xmath40 ; @xcite for @xmath41 ; a combination of both for @xmath42 ) . the values of @xmath39 and @xmath38",
    "are shown in figure  [ f : rstartstar ] .",
    "it is important to note that the evolutionary age of the central sources is not a parameter in the radiation transfer code , and was only used to get a coherent radius and temperature as well as approximate ranges of disk and envelope parameters .",
    "any errors in the evolutionary tracks can easily be accommodated by the large range of parameter values allowed at a given age .",
    "furthermore it is always possible to reassign a stellar source age to a model if it is found that a different set of evolutionary tracks is more appropriate for pre - main - sequence stars    once the stellar parameters were determined , these were used to find the disk and envelope parameters . since there exists no exact relation between the parameters of the central star and those of the circumstellar environment , we sampled values of the various parameters from ranges that are functions of the evolutionary age of the central source , as well as functions of the stellar masses in certain cases .",
    "these ranges were based on theoretical predictions and observations .",
    "the ( azimuthally symmetric ) density structure @xmath43 for the rotationally flattened infalling envelope is given in spherical polar coordinates by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the envelope accretion rate , @xmath46 is the centrifugal radius , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the polar angle ) , and @xmath49 is cosine of the angle of a streamline of infalling particles as @xmath50 . the centrifugal radius @xmath46 determines the approximate disk radius and flattening in the envelope structure .",
    "we solve for @xmath49 from the equation for the streamline : @xmath51 the range of values sampled for each of the envelope parameters , as well as the final parameter values , are shown in figure  [ f : envelope ] .",

    "the range of accretion rate values @xmath52 at a given time is two orders of magnitude wide , and the values were sampled uniformly in @xmath56 .",
    "the average values were chosen to match estimates of low - mass @xcite and high - mass ysos @xcite . in cases where this value fell below @xmath57 ,",
    "the envelope was discarded , and the yso model was considered as a disk - only model .",
    "finally , for stellar masses above @xmath58@xmath1 the envelope accretion rate was sampled from the same range of @xmath45 as a @xmath58@xmath1 model , so that the largest value of @xmath52 is @xmath59yr@xmath60 .",

    "* examination of our grid of models shows a jump in a@xmath112 in high - mass sources between those without envelopes and those with even low - density envelopes .",
    "this is due to the fact that we set a floor to the envelope density at the ambient density , and the outer radii of envelopes around high - luminosity sources are large .",

    "the spectral index classification ( ` class ' ) can sometimes lead to confusion in terminology , as it has in many cases become synonymous with evolutionary stage ; yet , the same object can be classified in different ways depending on viewing angle .",
    "for example , an edge - on disk can have a positive spectral index that would make it a class  i object ; and a pole - on `` embedded '' source might have a flat spectrum , rather than a rising one @xcite .",
    "other effects , such as increased stellar temperature ( above the canonical taurus value of @xmath120k ) can lead to positive spectral indices in disk sources @xcite .    in discussing the evolutionary stages of our models ,",
    "we adopt a ` stage ' classification analogous to the ` class ' scheme , but referring to the actual evolutionary stage of the object , based on its physical properties ( e.g. disk mass or envelope accretion rate ) rather than properties of its sed ( e.g. slope ) .",
    "stage  0 and i objects have significant infalling envelopes and possibly disks , stage  ii objects have optically thick disks ( and possible remains of a tenuous infalling envelope ) , and stage  iii objects have optically thin disks .    using this classification alongside the spectral index classification can help avoid any confusion between observable and physical properties : for example , we would refer to an edge - on disk as a stage  ii object that may display a class  i sed ( rather than an ` edge - on class  ii ' object ) .",
    "the exact boundaries between the different stages are of course arbitrary in the same way as the class scheme . in the following sections , we choose to define stage  0/i objects as those that have @xmath121yr@xmath60 , stage  ii objects as those that have @xmath122yr@xmath60 and @xmath123 , and stage  iii objects as those that have @xmath122yr@xmath60 and @xmath124 .",

    "since we are using a monte - carlo radiation transfer code , it is possible to track various properties as photons propagate through the grid , and for instance to flag each one by its last point of origin . for example , an energy packet absorbed and re - emitted by the disk is considered to have a point of origin in the disk .",

    "the current grid of models does not have sufficient signal - to - noise to produce high - resolution polarization spectra .",
    "however , the polarization can be smoothed and convolved with broadband filter profiles . because these models are axisymmetric and include scattering from spherical grains ( no dichroism from aligned grains ) , the polarization can be fully described by the @xmath125 stokes parameter , @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the degree of linear polarization , and @xmath128 is the orientation of the polarization with respect to the axis of symmetry ( in these models , this is perpendicular to the disk plane , or parallel to the presumed outflow axis ) .",
    "negative @xmath125 polarization indicates that the polarization is aligned parallel to the disk plane , and positive @xmath125 polarization is aligned perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "the first thing to note about the results in figure  [ f : seds_pol ] is that the polarization sign varies with wavelength and stage .",
    "this is shown more clearly in figure  [ f : k_pol ] , which shows k - band polarization from the entire grid of models as a function of evolutionary stage for four selected inclinations .",
    "the highly embedded stage  i sources have negative polarization ( that is , aligned parallel to the disk plane ) ; and the less embedded stage  i and stage  ii sources have the opposite sign .",
    "this is an optical depth effect , as discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as an optical depth effect",
    ", it is also a wavelength effect , since the dust opacity decreases with increasing wavelength . as shown in figure 9 , the high - mass stage  i source exhibits a sign change with wavelength .",
    "this is a clear indication of a stage  i source , since a stage  ii source always has polarization oriented perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "a stage i source has polarization aligned parallel to the disk at short wavelengths , where scattering in the outflow cavities is the main source of polarization , and the disk is too deeply embedded to be visible . at longer wavelengths the envelope becomes more optically thin , and scattering in the disk plane dominates the polarization , causing it to become aligned perpendicular to the disk . if a sign change in the polarization is observed , this information can be used to distinguish a stage  i source from an edge - on stage  ii source , which could have a similar sed .",
    "however , we note that the reverse is not necessarily true : the absence of a sign change in the polarization does not necessarily rule out that the source is a stage  i object , since a sign change can occur outside the observed wavelength range .        in this section ,",
    "we examine the spectral indices of our model seds .",
    "the traditional definition of the spectral index of an sed @xcite is its slope in @xmath6 vs @xmath7 space , longward of 2@xmath3 m .",

    "both definitions have been used in the literature ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite use @xmath131}$ ] , while @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite use @xmath133}$ ] ) , and in some cases it is not explicitely stated which choice has been made . in this section",
    ", we choose to use the @xmath131}$]definition of spectral index , as it is unique for each sed for a given @xmath129 and @xmath130 , whereas @xmath133}$]depends on which points are included inside the range .",
    "as noted previously ( section [ s : output ] ) , each sed is computed in 50 different apertures .",
    "the main effect of varying the aperture is a bluing of the colors of stage  i sources with larger aperture , as discussed in @xcite . to match typical point - source photometry observations ,",
    "we use our @xmath134au aperture , which corresponds to @xmath135  at a distance of 1kpc .",
    "figure  [ f : sivsparams ] shows the dependence of three different spectral indices on the envelope accretion rate and the disk mass .",
    "the following spectral indices were computed for all the model seds in the grid : @xmath136}$ ] , @xmath137}$ ] , and @xmath138}$ ] . in this section and following sections we refer to @xmath138}$]as our ` reference ' spectral index since it is close to the commonly used @xmath139@xmath3 m  range .    in order to calculate a spectral index using either method from a given set of fluxes , we require these fluxes to have a signal - to - noise of at least 2 . the hashed box in figure  [ f : sivsparams ] shows the values of @xmath52 for which at least @xmath98% of seds had insufficient signal - to - noise for the spectral index calculation .",
    "we first look at how the reference spectral index ( shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ f : sivsparams ] ) depends on the disk mass and the envelope accretion rate :    * the tendency is for the spectral index to increase as the disk mass and the envelope accretion rate increase .",
    "therefore , on average , younger sources tend to have a larger spectral index .",
    "however , for a given disk mass or envelope accretion rate , the spread in the values of the spectral index is important .",
    "this suggests that although in large samples of sources larger spectral indices are likely to indicate youth , the spectral index of an individual source is not a reliable indicator of its evolutionary stage .",
    "for example , a source with a reference spectral index of @xmath140 could have virtually any disk mass or envelope accretion rate .",
    "* for disk masses @xmath141 , the spectral index increases proportionally to @xmath142 , whereas above this limit the spectral index is independent of disk mass .",
    "this is because for low disk masses the disk is optically thin , and near- and mid - ir radiation is seen from the whole disk , whereas for larger disk masses the disk is optically thick , and the near- and mid - ir radiation is only seen from the surface layers of the disk .",
    "this is in agreement with the results from @xcite . * for envelope accretion rates",
    "@xmath122yr@xmath60 , the spectral index does not vary with @xmath52 .",
    "this indicates that the envelope is optically thin and does not contribute significantly to the sed , i.e. the sed is dominated by disk or stellar emission . * for envelope accretion rates",
    "@xmath121yr@xmath60 the range of possible spectral indices widens and the upper limit of this range increases roughly linearly with @xmath143 .",
    "the widening of the range is likely due to the high dependence of stage  i colors on viewing angle @xcite and stellar temperature @xcite .",
    "the increase of the upper limit is expected : as the accretion rate increases the envelope becomes more optically thick , and progressively obscures the central source and the regions of high - temperature dust , reddening the sed . *",
    "the decrease in the upper range of spectral indices for @xmath144yr@xmath60 is an artifact due to the signal - to - noise requirements for computing a spectral index : models with heavily embedded sources have very few or no energy packets emerging at near - ir wavelengths , leading to a poor signal - to - noise at these wavelengths .",
    "the majority of models with high accretion rates for which the reference spectral index can be calculated are pole - on or close to pole - on . for these seds",
    "the star is not heavily obscured by the envelope since one is looking down the cavity , and the spectral index is bluer . for models with @xmath145yr@xmath60 , @xmath146% of seds for the pole - on viewing angle",
    "have sufficient signal - to - noise at near- and mid - ir , as opposed to only @xmath147% of seds for the edge - on viewing angle ( this should improve in future grids of models , as we plan to produce higher signal - to - noise models ) . *",
    "our choice of boundary values for the ` stage ' classification seems to be appropriate , since most stage  i models have @xmath148 , most stage  ii models have @xmath149 , and a large fraction of stage  iii models have @xmath150 .",
    "this means that for the majority of models , the ` stage ' is equivalent to the ` class ' .",
    "the two top panels of figure  [ f : sivsparams ] show the spectral indices computed over a narrower wavelength range ( @xmath136}$ ] and @xmath137}$ ] ) .",
    "these show a similar pattern , albeit the spread in spectral indices is much larger for a given disk mass or envelope accretion rate .",
    "this shows that including a longer wavelength flux measurement ( @xmath151@xmath3 m ) in the spectral index calculation provides a better indicator of evolutionary stage .      as mentioned above , the spectral indices of the seds for disk - only models with @xmath152 are independent of @xmath153 . for these models ,",
    "the spread in spectral indices for a given @xmath153 is due mainly to the spread in stellar temperatures , disk inner radii , and disk flaring powers ; this is illustrated in figure  [ f : siadditional ] , which shows the dependence of the spectral index of these seds on the stellar temperature @xmath39 , the disk inner radius @xmath154 , and the disk flaring power @xmath91 .",
    "the left - hand panels shows all disk - only models with @xmath152 . for low temperatures ( @xmath155k ) ,",

    "the largest group , centered between spectral index values of @xmath156 and @xmath157 is the bulk of the disk models with no large inner holes .",
    "the smaller group , centered at lower spectral index values , represent the models which include inner holes large enough that the jhk and irac fluxes are purely photospheric .",
    "we note that in the case of the @xmath137}$ ] spectral index , and to a lesser extent the @xmath136}$ ] spectral index , the average value of these two groups decreases as the temperature increases from @xmath158k to @xmath20k .",
    "this is expected , as the colors of stellar photospheres at near - ir wavelengths for these temperatures are still dependent on the stellar temperature , and become bluer for larger temperatures .    beyond @xmath20k , the spectral indices increase with stellar temperature , at least in the case of the @xmath136}$ ] and the @xmath137}$ ] spectral indices .",
    "this is due to a lower contribution of the stellar flux compared to the infrared dust spectrum at these wavelengths @xcite . for models with a @xmath20k central source",
    ", this central source contributes significantly to the emergent spectrum , making the emission less red . for a @xmath18k stellar source ,",
    "the relative fraction of stellar flux to emission from the disk at near- and mid - ir wavelengths is much lower , leading to a more pure dust spectrum that is red at near- and mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "this can be seen in the seds for the stage  ii and iii models in figures  [ f : seds ] and [ f : seds_indiv ] : although the general shape of the contribution to the sed from the disk does not change significantly between the low- , intermediate- , and high - mass models , the change in the stellar spectrum leads to redder colors at near- and mid - ir wavelengths for the high - mass ( and therefore higher temperature ) model .",
    "the apparent gap in the models between @xmath159k and @xmath18k is due to the sampling of the model parameters using evolutionary tracks . for @xmath136}$ ] and",

    "the central panels in figure  [ f : siadditional ] show the detailed variations of the spectral index with disk inner radius for all the disk - only models with @xmath152 , and with stellar temperatures below @xmath159k . to avoid overcrowding of the plot",
    ", we do not show models with @xmath160 .",
    "in all three cases , the spectral index first increases , then decreases to reach photospheric levels .",
    "the initial increase is due to removal of the hottest dust from the inner disk and redistribution of the sed to slightly longer wavelengths .",
    "as the inner radius increases further , the amount of circumstellar material emitting in mid - ir wavelengths is reduced , and the mid - ir emission decreases .",
    "finally , in the right - hand panels of figure  [ f : siadditional ] , we show all the disk - only models with @xmath152 , with stellar temperatures below @xmath159k and with @xmath160 , versus the disk flaring power .",
    "a larger flaring power in a disk leads to an increasing surface intercepting the starlight , and therefore an increase in reprocessed radiation .",
    "this has only a slight effect on the @xmath136}$ ] and the @xmath137}$ ] spectral indices , but has a more pronounced effect on the reference spectral index @xmath138}$ ] .",
    "the wavelength range of the fluxes used to calculate the spectral index of a source is dependent on the observations available for that given source . in most cases ,",
    "the choice of this range is likely to affect the value of the spectral index itself .",
    "for example , as seen in section  [ s : sivsparams ] , a spectral index calculated using k and mips 24@xmath3 m  fluxes will in most cases differ from a spectral index calculated using irac 3.6@xmath3 m  and irac 8.0@xmath3 m  fluxes .",
    "figure  [ f : siranges ] shows the correlation between six different @xmath131}$]spectral indices ( calculated using various combinations of jhk , irac , and mips broadband fluxes ) and the reference spectral index @xmath138}$ ] .",
    "as can be seen , the value of the spectral index is highly dependent on the range of data used . in some cases",
    "the difference can be larger than 1.0 , which could lead to a different ` class ' being assigned to a source depending on what spectral index is used .",
    "the spectral index of a source may also be sensitive to whether it is calculated using only fluxes at two wavelengths ( i.e. @xmath131}$ ] ) , or whether it is calculated using all fluxes in a given wavelength range ( @xmath133}$ ] ) .",

    "the difference between @xmath161}$ ] and @xmath136}$ ] is small , typically of the order of 0.1 or less , which is expected , as the wavelength range is fairly narrow and the sed should be close to a straight line .",
    "the other three spectral indices , @xmath138}$ ] , @xmath162}$ ] , and @xmath163}$ ] , show a larger difference : in some cases , the spectral index calculated using the two methods differs by up to 0.5 .        the parameters of our grid of models were sampled in order to cover many stages of evolution and stellar masses . however , the distribution of models in parameter space is not meant to be representative of a typical star formation region , since it is meant to encompass outliers as well as typical objects , and since the models are sampled uniformly or close to uniformly in @xmath32 and @xmath37 .    therefore , in the current section , as well as presenting color - color diagrams for the whole grid of models , we also present results using a subset of models .",
    "this subset , which we will refer to as our _ virtual cluster _ was constructed by re - sampling models from the original grid in order to produce a standard imf for the stellar masses @xcite , and to produce a distribution of ages distributed linearly in time , rather than logarithmically .",
    "we decided to sample the stellar masses between @xmath0 and @xmath164 , and ages between @xmath70 and @xmath165yr . in this way",
    "we aim to reproduce the distribution of stellar masses and ages that might be expected from a cluster with the chosen imf and a continuous star formation rate having switched on @xmath165yr ago .",
    "the distribution of masses and ages for the original grid of models and the virtual cluster are shown in figure  [ f : cluster ] .",
    "we assumed two distances to this cluster : @xmath166pc to mimic a relatively nearby star formation region ( e.g. the perseus molecular cloud ) , and @xmath167kpc to mimic a distant star formation region such as those seen in the glimpse survey ( e.g. the eagle nebula ) .",
    "we used the fluxes integrated in the aperture closest to a 3  radius aperture at these distances ( i.e. @xmath168au and @xmath169au ) .",
    "we then applied sensitivity limits , using the bright and faint limits listed in table  [ t : glimpse_sens ] .",

    "the irac and mips 24@xmath3 m  limits are similar to those quoted for several large - scale surveys , such as the c2d @xcite and sage @xcite surveys .",
    "these limits will vary with exposure time and background levels , and the limits given here are just an example of a plausible range . the distribution of masses and ages remaining after applying these limits to the irac bands are shown in figure  [ f : realcluster ] : observations of the distant star - forming cluster with these sensitivity and saturation limits would be less sensitive to low - mass ysos and more sensitive to high - mass ysos than observations of the nearby cluster .",
    "in addition , observations of the distant star - forming cluster would be slightly biased towards earlier stages of evolution , as the luminosity of pre - main sequence stars decreases with age .",
    "color - color plots have been widely used to classify ysos , including for example jhk and irac color - color plots . in a recent study of this color - color space",

    "although the grid of models that was used covered a range of temperatures and evolutionary states , the interpretation of the color - color diagram was made using only models with a temperature of @xmath120k , an age of @xmath15myr , and using only one inclination . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "this analysis is appropriate for the taurus star formation region where most sources have stellar temperatures ranging from @xmath158k to @xmath20k @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned by @xcite , some of the very young sources , such as iras 04368 + 2557 , have bluer colors than predicted by @xcite .",
