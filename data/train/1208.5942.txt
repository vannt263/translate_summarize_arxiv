    "laser cooling exploits the mechanical effects of light in order to prepare atoms and trapped ions at temperatures that vary from microkelvin down to hundreds of nanokelvin @xcite . the combination with the coupling to the field of high - finesse resonators has brought novel perspectives for the manipulation of the atomic motion : recent works demonstrated the mechanical effects of light on the atomic motion even at the single - photon level @xcite , and exploited it in order to achieve trapping @xcite and cooling @xcite of the atomic center - of - mass motion .",
    "the coupling to a cavity has been also successfully employed for cooling the motion of an atom which is trapped by an external potential , such as a harmonic trap @xcite . in this setting ground - state cooling can be achieved by enhancing the scattering processes which reduce the vibrational excitations of the center - of - mass motion , thus implementing sideband cooling @xcite by means of the strong coupling with the cavity field @xcite .",
    "this implementation extends to trapped atoms the concepts developed for cooling free atoms by means of resonators @xcite .",
    "in addition , the quantum nature of the vibrational motion and of the cavity field allows one to identify different physical mechanisms involving photonic and vibrational excitations which contribute to a scattering process and which can thus interfere @xcite .",
    "this interference is a further resource for the manipulation of the atomic motion , since it can be used , for instance , to suppress scattering events leading to heating and/or diffusion of the center - of - mass motion .",
    "this knowledge has become particular relevant in view of recent experiments , which could observe these predictions @xcite .    in this article",
    "we continue the characterization of laser cooling of trapped atoms inside of resonators by studying the cooling efficiency of a single atom , which is confined inside a high - finesse resonator in the setup sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , under the condition that the resonator is pumped by a laser .",
    "we analyze the temperature and the cooling rate in detail , assuming that the atom is tightly confined and the relevant atomic states compose a two - level dipolar transition which is weakly driven by the cavity field .",
    "it is shown that , by suitably tuning the laser parameters , interference processes can enhance the cooling efficiency .",
    "the cooling dynamics that are identified are then compared to the ones found in the case in which the atom , instead of the resonator , is driven by a laser and which has been investigated in refs .",

    "therefore , single - photon absorption and emission events either do not have any mechanical effect or they modify the center - of - mass motion by one quantum of vibration . in this case , the dynamics of the atomic motion is often well described by a set of rate equations which determines the flow of populations @xmath12 between the vibrational levels @xmath13 of the confining potential .",
