    "in addressing the question ` what is the main epoch of metal production in the universe ? ' , or equivalently , ` when did the cosmic star - formation rate reach its peak value ? ' , a number of separate lines of evidence suggest that a high - rate of star - formation ( @xmath2 ) must have occurred in massive systems at @xmath3 .",
    "this evidence includes ( i ) the demonstration by renzini ( 1998 ) , using clusters of galaxies as probes of the past star - formation and metal production history , that 3050% of the present - day baryons are currently locked up in massive structures which appear to have formed at @xmath4 ; ( ii ) the peak in the co - moving number density of agn ( radio galaxies and quasars ) at @xmath5 , agn whose counterparts at low - redshift are hosted in luminous , massive elliptical galaxies ( @xmath6 - taylor  1996 , mcclure  1999 ) . at @xmath7 the universe is only 34gyrs old , which implies that a sustained star - formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath8 is required to build a massive elliptical galaxy by @xmath5 ( assuming that galaxies hosting high - z agn have already converted the major fraction of their mass into stars ) ; ( iii ) the recent discovery of elliptical galaxies at @xmath9 which contain stellar populations with ages of 34 gyrs ( dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , peacock _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . regardless of the cosmological model this requires an extreme formation redshift ( @xmath10 ) for the initial starburst in these galaxies ;",
    "( iv ) the dramatic increase in the number of star - forming galaxies at high - redshift identified in ground - based and hst faint galaxy samples . using a lyman - break colour selection technique ( steidel  1996 )",
    ", more than 3000 galaxies now have photometric redshifts with @xmath11 700 galaxies already spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath12 ( adelberger priv.comm . ) , with sfrs @xmath13 .",
    "however the attenuating effects of dust , inevitably associated with star - formation , means that sfrs estimated from these rest - frame uv luminosities must be treated as strict lower - limits .",
    "near - ir observations of rest - frame balmer - line emission suggest an upward correction factor to the sfrs of @xmath14 ( pettini  1998 ) , whilst more robust measurements of sfrs , derived from rest - frame fir luminosities , imply sfrs 600 times greater than that estimated from the uv luminosity ( hughes _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , cimatti _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) ; ( v ) similar evolution seen in both the radio - source population and the local starburst population , implying that radio source evolution is a good tracer of the star - formation history of the universe , suggests that the sfr density derived from lyman - limit galaxies at @xmath15 is under - estimated by a factor of @xmath16 ( dunlop 1998 ) , and therefore that once again the star - formation activity in the universe peaked at @xmath17 ; ( vi ) the small , but increasing number of submm continuum and co detections of high-@xmath18 quasars and radio galaxies , indicate that the host galaxies of these powerful agn contain large quantities of metal - enriched molecular gas ( @xmath19 , after correcting for gravitational amplification ) which can fuel massive bursts of star - formation ( omont  1996 , hughes  1997 , combes  1999 ) .    taken together , the observational evidence suggests that much of the on - going star - formation in the young universe may be _ hidden _ by dust from optical surveys and possibly also from ir surveys .",
    "hence the _ transparent _ view of the universe provided by submm observations , which now have the instrumental sensitivity to detect high-@xmath18 dust - enshrouded galaxies forming stars at a rate @xmath20 , and the preliminary evidence that galaxies ( particularly massive spheroidal systems ) exhibit strong luminosity evolution at submm wavelengths , demonstrate that comprehensive submm surveys will provide an important alternative measurement of the star - formation history of high-@xmath18 galaxies unhindered by the effects of dust .",
    "the star - formation history of the high-@xmath18 starburst galaxy population can be determined from an accurate measure of the integral submm source - counts , the luminosities and redshift distribution of the submm - selected galaxies . the contribution of the submm sources to the total fir  mm background measured by cobe ( hauser  1998 , fixen  1998 ) places an additional strong constraint on the possible evolution . by designing a series of cosmological submm surveys , covering a sufficiently wide range of complementary depths and areas ,",
    "it is possible to discriminate between competing models of galaxy evolution and the epochs of formation of massive galaxies .    the possibility of conducting cosmological surveys at submm wavelengths has been realised in the last few years with rapid technological advances in semiconductor materials , wafer fabrication , filter design and the temperature stability and performance of cryogenic systems operating at @xmath21mk",
    "this has led to the development and successful commissioning of sensitive bolometer arrays ( _ e.g. _ scuba , sharc , mambo , bolocam ) , all of which will be upgraded within the next few years .",
    "these cameras operate on largest telescopes ( 10-m cso , 15-m jcmt , 30-m iram ) and exploit the best ground - based mm and submm observing conditions .    despite these recent advances in instrumental sensitivity the primary reason that submm observations of galaxies at cosmological redshifts are at all possible",
    "is illustrated in fig1 .",
    "when attempting to observe galaxies out to extreme redshifts , observational cosmologists usually suffer the combined effect of cosmological dimming due to the vast distances , a steeply declining luminosity function and positive k - corrections",
    ". however the steep spectral index of the rayleigh - jeans emission from dust ( @xmath22 ) heated by young massive stars or agn , which radiates at 3070k and dominates the fir - submm luminosity , produces a negative k - correction at submm and mm wavelengths of sufficient strength to completely compensate for cosmological dimming at redshifts @xmath23 with the result that , in an einstein - de sitter universe , a dust - enshrouded starburst galaxy of a given luminosity should be as easy to detect at an extreme redshift @xmath24 as at @xmath25 .",
    "note that at millimetre wavelengths sources actually become brighter with increasing redshift .",
    "the situation is inevitably less favourable ( by a factor of 2 - 3 ) for low values of @xmath26 , but nevertheless this relative `` ease '' of access to the very high - redshift universe remains unique to submm cosmology ( blain & longair 1993 , blain & longair 1996 , hughes & dunlop 1998 ) .    by early 2001 ,",
    "the initial extensive programme of extragalactic scuba ( 850  @xmath27 m ) surveys conducted on the 15-m jcmt will be completed , covering areas of 0.0020.12  deg@xmath28 with respective @xmath29 depths in the range @xmath30 . to ensure these submm data",
    "are fully exploited , the current scuba surveys have been restricted to fields extensively studied at other wavelengths and which contain deep x - ray , optical , ir and radio imaging data ( _ e.g. _ hubble deep field , hawaii deep fields , low-@xmath18 lensing clusters , cfrs , lockman hole , elais ) . the results from these first submm surveys ( outlined below ) confirm that an era of massive dust - enshrouded star - formation exists at early epochs ( @xmath31 ) , with an intensity previously underestimated at optical wavelengths ( smail  1997 , hughes  1998 , eales  1999 , blain  1999 , barger  1999b ) .",
    "however despite the enhancement of observed sub - mm fluxes of high-@xmath18 starburst galaxies by factors of 310 at 850@xmath27 m , the deepest scuba surveys todate are still only sensitive to high-@xmath18 galaxies with sfrs comparable to the most luminous local ulirgs ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the following preliminary results from the on - going scuba surveys have already made a significant impact on several cosmological questions .",
    "* the faint submm source - counts at 850  @xmath27 m are reasonably well determined between 110mjy ( _ e.g. _ barger  1999b ) and significantly exceed a no - evolution model , requiring roughly @xmath33 luminosity evolution out to @xmath34 , however a variety of models are consisitent with the data .",
    "the submm background measured by cobe requires that the scuba source - counts must converge at @xmath35mjy . *",
    "submm sources generally appear to be associated with @xmath31 galaxies , although it not yet clear whether they necessarily have optical , ir and radio counterparts .",
    "there is still much debate about the fraction of submm sources at @xmath36 , and the fraction of submm - selected galaxies that contain an agn .",
    "currently the most accurate identifications and spectroscopic redshifts are found in the scuba survey of lensing clusters ( frayer  1998 , 1999 , ivison 1998 , barger  1999a ) . *",
    "approximately 3050% of the submm background has been resolved into individual high-@xmath18 galaxies at flux densities @xmath37  mjy , and therefore existing unlensed submm surveys , which are confusion - limited at about this flux level , are only within a factor @xmath38 in sensitivity of resolving the entire submm / fir background . in the scuba surveys of highly - lensed clusters it is possible to measure the source - counts down to a reduced confusion limit of @xmath39 ( blain  1998 ) .",
    "it now appears that the majority of submm background is due to a population of high-@xmath18 ultraluminous ( @xmath40 ) dusty galaxies forming stars at rates @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _ similar to the local ulirg galaxies although the surface density of the high-@xmath18 submm population is significantly higher .",
    "* at high - redshift ( @xmath42 ) the submm surveys find @xmath43 times the star formation rate observed in the initial optical surveys ( madau 1997 ) . however new optical surveys now agree more closely with the earlier submm result , finding no significant evidence for a decline in the star formation density between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , when corrections are applied to the rest - frame uv luminosities to account for obscuration by dust ( pettini  1998 , steidel  1998 ) .",
    "despite the success of the first scuba surveys , a number of deficiencies can be identified in the submm data which prevent a more accurate understanding of the star - formation history of high-@xmath18 galaxies .",
    "this review describes these deficiencies and outlines the future observations which will alleviate the following problems .      to improve the constraints on the competing evolutionary models provided by the current submm source - counts , it is necessary to ( 1 ) extend the restricted wavelength range of the surveys , ( 2 ) increase the dynamic range of the flux densities over which accurate source - counts are measured , and ( 3 ) increase the number of sources detected at a given flux level by surveying greater areas .",
    "all these goals can be achieved by conducting future surveys with a combination of more sensitive , larger format bolometer arrays operating at 200@xmath27 m  3 mm on larger ground - based and airborne telescopes .",
    "ground - based surveys at mm wavelengths can take advantage of a more stable and transparent atmosphere which will provide increased available integration time ( to gain deeper survey sensitivity or greater survey area ) and increased flux calibration accuracy .",
    "future surveys with more sensitive and larger format arrays ( _ e.g. _ bolocam ) will allow significantly greater areas to be covered ( hence more sources detected ) and will increase the range of the flux densities over which sources are detected . furthermore conducting surveys with larger diameter telescopes (",
    "_ e.g. _ 50-m large millimetre telescope ( lmt / gtm ) , 100-m green bank telescope ) will reduce the beam - size , hence decrease the depth of the confusion limit ( allowing deeper surveys ) and improve the positional accuracy .",
    "the scuba 850@xmath27 m surveys have indicated that the extragalactic submillimetre background is dominated by a high-@xmath18 population of sources with @xmath46mjy . at @xmath47",
    "the same population of sources will have 1.1 mm flux densities in the range @xmath48mjy respectively .",
    "the extragalactic confusion limit at 850@xmath27 m , estimated from the deepest scuba surveys , occurs at a depth of @xmath49 and corresponds to a source density n@xmath50 at a resolution of 15arcsecs .",
    "the ratio of 850@xmath27 m ( jcmt ) and 1.1 mm ( lmt ) beam - areas ( @xmath51 ) implies that confusion at 1.1 mm on the lmt will begin to become significant at a source density of @xmath52 . extrapolating models that adequately describe the measured 850@xmath27 m source - counts to longer wavelengths",
    "suggests that at 1.1 mm confusion occurs at @xmath53mjy .",
    "consequently a deep 1.1 mm bolocam / lmt survey has sufficient sensitivity and resolution to detect the entire submm - mm extragalactic background at a level above the confusion limit .",
    "the current submm source - counts are measured with varying degrees of precision at 850@xmath27 m between 110 mjy ( fig.2 , ) , whilst the future combination of bolocam on the 10-m cso ( 2000 ) and later ( @xmath54 ) on the 50-m lmt will provide accurate source counts at 1.1 mm between 0.1 and 100mjy .",
    "table1 illustrates the predicted number of galaxies detected in a series of future 50-hour lmt surveys at 1.1 mm with bolocam covering areas of 0.00170 sq .",
    "degrees during the commissioning phase of the telescope and later , with an improved surface ( @xmath55 m ) during routine operation . for example in a similar duration to the original scuba hdf survey , a 50-hour lmt survey at 1.1 mm ( with a @xmath29 detection limit of 2mjy ) will detect @xmath56 galaxies equivalent to hdf850.1 , the brightest submm source in the hdf ( @xmath57mjy ) .",
    ".number of 5@xmath58 galaxies detected in alternative 50-hour bolocam 1.1 mm surveys during the initial commissioning phase ( with a 100@xmath27 m r.m.s .",
    "surface ) of the lmt , and later during routine operation with an improved surface accuracy ( 70@xmath27 m ) and sensitivity .",
    "bolocam sensitivities allow for overheads . [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the current scuba surveys ( with @xmath59 resolution at 850@xmath27 m ) are struggling to unambiguously identify the submm sources with their optical / ir / radio counterparts .",
    "hence the redshift distribution and luminosities of the submm sources are still uncertain .",
    "this results directly from the submm positional errors of @xmath60 that are typical for even the highest s / n submm detections , and from the lack of submm data measuring the redshifted fir spectral peak at 200450  @xmath27 m .",
    "the positions of the brightest scuba sources ( @xmath61mjy ) can be improved with mm - interferometric observations . however an iram plateau de bure follow - up of the brightest source in the hubble deep field has demonstrated that even with @xmath62 resolution and sub - arcsec positional errors , an ambiguous optical identification , and hence ambiguous redshift remains ( downes _ et al .",
    "it should be no surprise that submm selected galaxies , including those with mm - interferometric detections , do not always have optical counterparts , since high-@xmath18 galaxies observed in the earliest stages of formation may be heavily obscured by dust .",
    "indeed this is the most compelling reason for conducting the submm surveys in the first instance and therefore searches for the counterparts may be more successful at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this was recently demonstrated by smail _",
    "( 1999 ) who took deep near - ir ( @xmath63 m ) images of two lensed clusters , previously observed by scuba ( smail _ et al .",
    "the original counterparts were identified as two bright low - redshift ( @xmath64 ) galaxies 510 arcsecs distant from the submm sources . however the new ir images revealed two high-@xmath18 ( @xmath17 ) ir galaxies , with no optical counterparts , within 2 - 3 arcsecs of the scuba sources .",
    "the consequence of these mis - identifications is an inaccurate determination of star - formation history of high-@xmath18 galaxies .",
    "the uncertainty in the redshift distribution of the submm - selected galaxies can be significantly reduced by measuring the mid - ir to radio seds of the individual sources .",
    "the power of using mid - ir to radio flux ratios ( _ e.g. _ 15/850@xmath27 m , 450/850@xmath27 m , 850/1300@xmath27 m , 850@xmath27m/1.4  ghz ) as a crude measure of the redshift of submm - selected galaxies was demonstrated by hughes _",
    "( 1998 ) during the scuba survey of the hubble deep field and has since been described elsewhere ( e.g. carilli & yun 1999 , blain 1999 ) .",
    "the overall similarity of the ir - radio seds of starburst galaxies , ulirgs and radio - quiet agn in the low-@xmath18 universe provides a useful _ template _ with which to compare the colours of high-@xmath18 submm population ( particularly in the absence of information regarding the relative starburst / agn contributions ) .",
    "hence given sufficient instrumental sensitivity , the fir ",
    "radio colours of a submm source can discriminate between optical / ir counterparts which are equally probable on positional grounds alone , but which have significantly different redshifts , @xmath65 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "this important technique , and the necessity for sensitive short submm data ( 200500@xmath27 m ) measuring the rest - frame fir seds of the individual high - z submm galaxies , without which it remains impossible to constrain their bolometric luminosities and sfrs , provide the major scientific justifications behind blast , a future ( @xmath66 ) nasa long - duration balloon - borne large - aperture submm telescope ( p.i .",
    "m.devlin , upenn ) operating at an altitude of 140,000 ft .",
    "table2 describes a series of possible blast surveys which demonstrate that even a single 50-hour survey will be able to follow - up all the wide - area shallow scuba surveys observed todate .",
    "for example if there are 5@xmath58 scuba sources ( @xmath67mjy ) with no _ blast _ 5@xmath58 counterparts at 300@xmath27 m , _ i.e. _ @xmath68mjy , then the 300/850@xmath27 m flux ratio must be @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that the scuba source is most likely a galaxy at @xmath70 for all typical starburst seds ( fig.4 ) .",
    "blast will also be an ideal complement to the future bolocam bright mm - surveys ( @xmath71 ) on the cso and lmt .",
    "a measurement of the confusion noise due to extragalactic sources at 200500@xmath27 m with a @xmath72-m class telescope is an important secondary goal since the result will influence future first survey strategies beyond 2007 .",

    "the frequency separation of adjacent mm - wavelength co transitions is @xmath77ghz .",
    "hence at redshifts @xmath78 , any adjacent pair of co transitions are separated by @xmath79ghz , similar to the width of the 3 mm ( 75110ghz ) atmospheric window . at these frequencies",
    "one can expect to detect the most luminous redshifted co transitions from starbursts ( @xmath80=65 @xmath81 @xmath80=32 ) .",
    "therefore , provided one can first pre - select from submm surveys those galaxies with sufficiently high ( but still unknown ) redshifts , using their fir  mm colours , the availability of a `` co _ redshift machine _ '' with a large instantaneous bandwidth ( @xmath82ghz ) , operating on large single - dish mm - wavelength telescopes ( _ e.g. _ 50-m lmt , 100-m gbt ) , will offer an incredibly powerful and more efficient alternative method to determine the accurate redshift distribution of the submm population .    whilst future submm surveys will undoubtably detect increasing numbers of high-@xmath18 galaxies , an accurate description of their evolutionary history will not be possible without accurate redshifts and constraints on their bolometric luminosities ( and star - formation rates ) .",
    "the overall strategy requires the follow - up of submm surveys with sensitive fir ",
    "submm airborne ( sofia ) , balloon - borne ( blast ) and satellite observations ( sirtf , first ) , together with wide - band mm - wavelength spectroscopic measurements .",
