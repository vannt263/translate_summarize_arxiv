    "in view of running and future heavy - ion collisions experiments determination of the ( pseudo)critical temperature @xmath2 as well as studies of other features of the finite temperature transition in full qcd with @xmath3 and @xmath4 flavors of dynamical quarks are subjects of many recent lattice investigations .",
    "three groups employed improved staggered fermions and an improved gauge field action  @xcite .",
    "simulations with staggered fermions , although computationally less demanding , are made with the use of the fourth root of the fermion determinant .",
    "this introduces theoretical uncertainty .",
    "thus studies with the wilson - type quark actions free of such problem are necessary . the cp - pacs @xcite , whot - qcd @xcite and dik @xcite collaborations used improved wilson fermions with an improved or unimproved gauge field action . in this paper",
    "we are using the lattice configurations generated by dik collaboration .",
    "recent results  @xcite show importance of the finite lattice spacing effects in the studies of the finite temperature transition in qcd .",
    "the dik collaboration simulations were done on lattices with large @xmath5 , i.e. the transition was studied at small lattice spacing , close to the continuum limit .",
    "for this reason we consider it important to study in more details various features of the finite temperature qcd using gauge field configurations accumulated by dik collaboration . in this letter we present results for the spatial string tension @xmath6 .    in the presence of dynamical quarks",
    "the flux tube formed between static quark - antiquark pairs breaks at large distances .",
    "in contrast the so called spatial wilson loop , i.e. the wilson loop with both directions being spatial is found to show non - vanishing spatial string tension even at @xmath7 .",
    "this is called the spatial confinement .",
    "@xmath6 is one of the fundamental quantities to characterize the perturbative and non - perturbative properties of the hot qcd medium .",
    "it provides useful information about the effective 3d model , which can be obtained by integrating out heavy modes .",
    "it is believed that non - perturbative contributions to observables , which at high temperature are dominated by contributions of magnetic modes , are flavor independent apart from indirect dependence through the flavor dependence of the running coupling .",
    "@xmath6 can be used to test this aspect of the dimensional reduction approach to qcd .",
    "although quarks are expected to decouple from the spatial observables for @xmath8 due to dimensional reduction and thus do not affect @xmath6 in the high temperature limit , it is not obvious whether the same is true near @xmath2 .",
    "thus lattice computations are also useful to check theoretical predictions for this range of temperatures .",
    "@xmath6 was recently computed by rbc - bielefeld @xcite and whot - qcd @xcite collaborations .",
    "our lattice action is different from that used in @xcite and similar to action used in @xcite .",
    "the important difference from @xcite is that we are working at two times smaller lattice spacing , i.e. much closer to the continuum limit .",
    "we perform computations on @xmath9 lattices while in @xcite @xmath10 lattices were used .",
    "the configurations were generated with the usual wilson gauge field action and the non - perturbatively @xmath11 improved wilson fermionic action @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the original wilson fermionic action , @xmath15 is the gauge coupling and @xmath16 is the field strength tensor . the clover coefficient @xmath17 is determined non - perturbatively @xcite .",
    "we use configurations generated at two values of the lattice coupling @xmath18 : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for temperatures between @xmath21 and @xmath22 . to fix the physical scale and the quark mass results obtained with this action by qcdsf and ukqcd",
    "collaborations  @xcite were used .",
    "the scale is fixed by the phenomenological length @xmath23 @xcite and the quark mass is fixed by @xmath24 value .",
    "the parameters of our lattices are presented in the table  [ tab : configs ] .",
    "note , that we used for @xmath2 the value depending on @xmath24 which was obtained using interpolation of dik results as function of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for this reason values for @xmath25 in table  [ tab : configs ] are slightly different from those in @xcite .",
    "we evaluate @xmath6 following computational procedure used in @xcite where pure gauge theories were investigated .",
    "let us consider @xmath26 direction as the time direction of the spatial wilson loops .",
    "the temperature dependent spatial static potential @xmath27 is then defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are wilson loops of size @xmath30 in lattice units .",
    "we assume an ansatz for @xmath27 including linear and selfenergy terms : @xmath31 the ambiguous coulomb term is not included and instead we make our fits at large distances @xmath32 to avoid such term contribution . to increase the overlap with the respective ground state the ape smearing @xcite of the links orthogonal to this direction was used .",
    "furthermore , the hypercubic blocking ( hyp ) procedure @xcite was applied to links in @xmath26-direction to decrease the selfenergy @xmath33 and thus to decrease the statistical errors .",
    "we applied three steps of hyp .",
    "it occurred that the first step produced the maximal effect decreasing statistical errors of the potential @xmath27 by factor about 5 .",
    "application of the second and third steps of hyp were much less effective but still useful , decreasing statistical errors by about 20% .    .",
    "]    the limit @xmath34 in ( [ potential1 ] ) was approximated by taking the spatial wilson loops with extension @xmath35 or 5 to evaluate @xmath27 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : potential ] we show the potential @xmath27 with @xmath36 subtracted as function of @xmath37 for different temperatures .",
    "one can see that potentials for all temperatures agrees with each other quite well , i.e. there is no strong temperature dependence in the temperature interval considered . respectively",
    "the spatial string tension is also virtually independent of temperature as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : string_tension_1 ] . in this figure",
    "we present our results for @xmath38 as a dimensionless ratio @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the physical string tension at zero temperature .",
    "decreases with decreasing of the quark mass @xcite .",
    "we took this into account using for @xmath40 results of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath41 values close to our respective values as shown in table  [ tab : configs ] .",
    "] we also depicted in this figure dik results for the finite temperature physical string tension @xmath42 to emphasize drastic difference in the temperature dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath38 .    our results for @xmath38 allow to conclude that for temperatures below @xmath2 @xmath38 is constant and equal to @xmath40 .",
    "this does not come as a surprise since such equality was observed in the quenched theory long ago @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly the only previous result for @xmath43 in unquenched lattice qcd  @xcite contradicts our result . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath44 for @xmath43 is roughly @xmath45 i.e. essentially higher then @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for such confusing result might be that in ref .",
    "@xcite different method to extract the string tension @xmath6 was used . at @xmath47",
    "our results are also different from those of ref .",
    "@xcite although agree qualitatively with results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "let us now compare our results with two theoretical predictions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the following expression for @xmath38 at @xmath48 was derived within the field correlators approach @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the inverse magnetic correlation length and is taken in ref .",
    "@xcite equal to 1.5  gev .",
    "plotting square root of expression ( [ agasian ] ) in fig .  2 we took @xmath51 thus taking @xmath52 mev .",
    "note that in the considered temperature range the precise value of @xmath53 is not important .",
    "when @xmath54 equation ( [ agasian ] ) suggests very slow increase of the spatial string tension with temperature in nice agreement with our numerical results .",
    "recently prediction for @xmath38 was derived via ads / qcd approach @xcite : @xmath55}\\,,\\quad t \\ge t_c\\ , , \\label{viz}\\ ] ] and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "this expression also provide qualitatively good description of our data , as can be seen from fig .  2 .",
    "( full circles ) as function of temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath40 are shown in table i , see explanation in the text .",
    "respective data for the finite temperature physical string tension @xmath42 ( empty circles ) computed by dik @xcite is shown for comparison .",
    "the curves are theoretical predictions from ref .",
    "@xcite ( thin curve ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( thick curve ) . ]",
    "we shall note that in our computations we do not keep the pion mass fixed , i.e. the computations are not made along the constant physics line .",
    "this may introduce sizable systematic effects if @xmath58 has strong dependence on the quark mass . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath6 was computed for two values of @xmath59 , 0.65 and 0.85 . the mild dependence on the quark mass was observed .",
    "these results need to be confirmed . in any case",
    "our conclusion about independence of @xmath6 on the temperature below transition is intact since @xmath60 varies by only about 10% when temperature increases from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , as can be seen from the table [ tab : configs ] .",
    "let us summarize our main results .",
    "we presented first numerical evidence in unquenched lattice qcd that for temperatures below @xmath2 @xmath38 is constant and equal to @xmath40 , the physical string tension at @xmath63 .",
    "this is in agreement with quenched lattice qcd results and theoretical predictions .",
    "the theoretical predictions eq.([agasian ] ) @xcite and eq([viz ] ) @xcite for @xmath38 at temperatures @xmath64 where all known lattice results clearly deviate from the expected high temperature behavior @xmath65 are in good agreement with our results with better agreement for eq.([agasian ] ) .",
