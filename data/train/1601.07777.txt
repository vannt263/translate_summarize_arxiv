    "yellow , blue and dark blue : this is the simple color palette used for painting and penning each of the two - sided nobel diplomas awarded to takaaki kajita @xcite and arthur b.  mcdonald @xcite . on the left side , one can gaze at an artist s view  sketched with a few broad strokes  of the neutrino transformative trip from the bright yellow sun , through the earth s blue darkness , into a blue pool of water @xcite . on the right side , one can read the  beautifully and precisely penned  nobel laureate names and prize motivations , in ink colors that continuously change from deep blue to blue with yellow shades @xcite . in a sense , the two sides of the diplomas evoke the interplay between a broad - brush picture of @xmath2 masses and mixings ( the pioneering era ) and carefully designed measurements and theoretical descriptions ( the precision era ) , in a continuous feedback between breakthrough and control , that may open the field to further fundamental discoveries @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at presenting both the broad - brush features and the fine structure of the current picture of neutrino oscillation phenomena , involving the mixing of the three neutrino states having definite flavor @xmath19 with three states @xmath20 having definite masses @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "information on known and unknown neutrino mass - mixing parameters is derived by a global analysis of neutrino oscillation data , that extends and updates our previous work @xcite with recent experimental inputs , as discussed in sec .  2 ( see also @xcite for previous global analyses by other groups ) . in sec .  3 , precise constraints ( at few % level )",
    "are obtained on four well - known oscillation parameters , namely , the squared - mass differences @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the mixing angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "less precise constraints , including an octant ambiguity , are reported for the angle @xmath5 . in this picture",
    ", we also discuss the current unknowns related to the neutrino mass hierarchy [ sign@xmath26 and to the possible leptonic cp - violating phase @xmath7 .",
    "the trend favoring negative values of @xmath11 appears to be confirmed , with best - fit values around @xmath27@xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) .",
    "more fragile indications , which depend on alternative analyses of specific data sets , concern the exclusion of some @xmath7 ranges at @xmath13 , and a slight preference for normal hierarchy at 90% c.l .",
    "the covariances of selected parameter pairs , and the implications for non - oscillation searches , are presented in sec .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in this section we discuss methodological issues and input updates for the global analysis .",
    "readers interested only in the fit results may jump to sec .  3 .    in general",
    ", no single oscillation experiment can currently probe , with high sensitivity , the full parameter space spanned by the mass - mixing variables @xmath30 .",
    "one can then group different data sets , according to their specific sensitivities or complementarities with respect to some oscillation parameters .",
    "we follow the methodology of refs .  @xcite as summarized below .",
    "we first combine the data coming from solar and kamland reactor experiments ( `` solar+kl '' ) with those coming from long - baseline accelerator searches in both appearance and disappearance modes ( `` lbl acc '' ) .",
    "the former data set constrains the @xmath31 parameters ( and , to some extent , also @xmath25 @xcite ) , which are a crucial input for the @xmath0 probabilities relevant to the latter data set .",
    "the combination `` lbl acc+solar+kl data '' provides both upper and lower bounds on the @xmath32 parameters but , by itself , is not particularly sensitive to @xmath7 or to sign(@xmath33 ) ( @xmath34 for normal hierarchy , nh , and @xmath35 for inverted hierarchy , ih ) .    the lbl acc+solar+kl data are then combined with short - baseline reactor data ( `` sbl reactors '' ) , that provide strong constraints on the @xmath25 mixing angle via disappearance event rates , as well as on useful bounds on @xmath36 via spectral data ( when available ) .",
    "the synergy between lbl acc+solar+kl data and sbl reactor data increases significantly the sensitivity to @xmath7 @xcite .    finally , we add atmospheric neutrino data ( `` atmos '' ) , which probe both flavor appearance and disappearance channels for @xmath2 and @xmath1 , both in vacuum and in matter , with a very rich phenomenology spanning several decades in energy and path lengths .",
    "this data set is dominantly sensitive to the mass - mixing pair ( @xmath37 ) and , subdominantly , to all the other oscillation parameters . despite their complexity",
    ", atmospheric data may thus add useful pieces of information on subleading effects ( and especially on the three unknown parameters ) , which may either support or dilute the indications coming from the previous data sets .    in all cases ,",
    "the fit results are obtained by minimizing a @xmath38 function , that depends on the arguments @xmath30 and on a number of systematic nuisance parameters via the pull method @xcite .",
    "allowed parameter ranges at @xmath39 standard deviations are defined via @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the same definition is maintained in covariance plots involving parameter pairs , so that the previous @xmath39 ranges are recovered by projecting the allowed regions onto each axis .",
    "undisplayed parameters are marginalized away .",
    "a final remark is in order .",
    "the definition @xmath41 is based on wilks theorem @xcite , that is not strictly applicable to discrete choices ( such as nh vs ih , see @xcite and references therein ) or to cyclic variables ( such as @xmath7 , see @xcite ) .",
    "concerning hierarchy tests , it has been argued that the above @xmath39 prescription can still be used to assess the statistical difference between nh and ih with good approximation @xcite . concerning cp violation tests , the prescription appears to lead ( in general ) to more conservative bounds on @xmath7 , as compared with the results obtained from numerical experiments @xcite . in principle",
    ", one can construct the correct @xmath38 distribution by generating extensive replicas of all the relevant data sets via monte carlo simulations , randomly spanning the space of the neutrino oscillation and systematic nuisance parameters .",
    "however , such a construction would be extremely time - consuming and is beyond the scope of this paper . for the sake of simplicity , we shall adopt the conventional @xmath39 definition , supplemented by cautionary comments when needed .",
    "with respect to @xcite , the solar neutrino analysis is unchanged .",
    "concerning kamland ( kl ) reactor neutrinos , we continue to use the 2011 data release @xcite as in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the latest published kl data @xcite are divided into three subsets , with correlated systematics that are difficult to implement outside the collaboration . in this work , we reanalyze the 2011 kl data for the following reason .    the kl analysis requires the ( unoscillated ) absolute reactor @xmath42 spectra as input . in this context , a new twist has been recently provided by the observation of a @xmath43 event excess in the range @xmath447  mev ( the so - called `` bump '' or `` shoulder '' ) @xcite , with respect to the expectations from reference huber - mller ( hm ) spectra @xcite , in each of the current high - statistics sbl reactor experiments reno @xcite , double chooz @xcite and daya bay @xcite .",
    "this new spectral feature is presumably due to nuclear physics effects ( see the recent review in @xcite ) , whose origin is still subject to investigations and debate @xcite . in principle , one would like to know in detail the separate spectral modifications for each reactor fuel component @xcite . however , the only information available at present is the overall energy - dependent ratio @xmath45 between data and hm predictions , which we extract ( and smooth out ) from the latest daya bay results ( see fig .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we use the @xmath45 ratio as an effective fudge factor multiplying the unoscillated hm spectra for kamland , which are thus anchored to the absolute daya bay spectrum @xcite . in our opinion , this overall correction can capture the main bump effects in the kl spectral analysis .",
    "more refined kl data fits will be possible when the bump feature(s ) will be better understood and broken down into separate spectral components . concerning the kl dominant oscillation parameters @xmath31 , we find that the inclusion of the bump fudge factor induces a slight negative shift of their best - fit values , which persists in combination with solar data ( see sec .  3 ) .",
    "finally , we recall that the @xmath0 analysis of solar+kl data is performed in terms of three free parameters @xmath46 , providing a weak but interesting indication for nonzero @xmath25 @xcite . tiny differences between transition probabilities in nh and ih @xcite are negligible within the present accuracy .",
    "the hierarchy - independent function @xmath47 , derived from the solar+kl data fit , is then used in combination with the following lbl accelerator data .      with respect to @xcite",
    ", we include the most recent results from the tokai - to - kamioka ( t2k ) experiment in japan and from the no@xmath2a experiment at fermilab , in both appearance and disappearance modes .",
    "in particular , we include the latest t2k neutrino data @xcite and the first t2k antineutrino data @xcite , as well as the first no@xmath2a neutrino data as of january 2016 @xcite . the statistical analysis of lbl experiments has been performed using a modified version of the software globes @xcite for the calculation of the expected number of events . and",
    "@xmath5 via the position and amplitude of the oscillation dip , respectively . in appearance mode ,",
    "characterized by much lower statistics , we have fitted the total number of events .",
    "we have checked that , even for t2k @xmath2 appearance data , total - rate or spectral analyses of events produce very similar results in the global fit . ] for each lbl data set , the @xmath38 function takes into account poisson statistics @xcite and the main systematic error sources , typically related to energy - scale errors and to normalization uncertainties of signals and backgrounds , as taken from @xcite . concerning no@xmath2a @xmath16 appearance data ,",
    "the collaboration used two different event selection methods for increasing the purity of the event sample : a primary method based on a likelihood identification ( lid ) selector , and a secondary one based on a library event matching ( lem ) selector , leading to somewhat different results for the @xmath16 signal and background @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the lid data as a default choice for no@xmath2a , but we shall also comments on the impact of the alternative lem data .",
    "we have reproduced with good approximation the allowed parameter regions shown by t2k @xcite and by no@xmath2a @xcite ( in both lid and lem cases @xcite ) , under the same hypotheses or restrictions adopted therein for the undisplayed parameters .",
    "we remark that , in our global analysis ( see sec .  4 ) ,",
    "all the oscillation parameters are left unconstrained .",
    "note that we define the parameter @xmath36 , driving the dominant lbl oscillations , as @xmath48 in both nh ( @xmath49 ) and ih ( @xmath50 ) @xcite . a comparative discussion of this and alternative conventions in terms of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 is reported in @xcite and references therein .",
    "although any such convention is immaterial ( as far as the full @xmath0 oscillation probabilities are used ) , the adopted one must be explicitly declared , since the various definitions differ by terms of @xmath56 , comparable to the current @xmath57 uncertainty of @xmath36 .      with respect to @xcite",
    ", we include herein the spectral data on the far - to - near detector ratio as a function of energy , as recently reported by the experiments daya bay ( fig .  3 of @xcite ) and reno ( fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "besides the statistical errors , we include a simplified set of pulls for energy - scale and flux - shape systematics , since the bin - to - bin correlations are not publicly reported in @xcite .",
    "we neglect systematics related to the spectral bump feature , which affect absolute spectra ( see sec .",
    "2.1 ) but largely cancel in the analysis of far / near ratios ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we reproduce with good accuracy the joint allowed regions reported in @xcite and @xcite for the mixing amplitude @xmath58 and their effective squared mass parameters @xmath55 , for both nh and ih .",
    "definitions and conventions , see @xcite . in any case , in our global fits we always use the @xmath36 parameter defined in eq .",
    "( [ dm2 ] ) . ]",
    "we then combine the daya bay and reno analyses , in terms of our default parameters @xmath59 and @xmath36 .",
    "the combined fit results are dominated , for both mass - mixing parameters , by the high - statistics daya bay data .",
    "while the reactor bounds on @xmath25 are extremely strong , the current bounds on @xmath36 are not yet competitive with those coming from lbl accelerator data in disappearance mode , although they help in reducing slightly its uncertainty ( see sec .  4 ) .      with respect to @xcite",
    ", we update our analysis of super - kamiokande ( sk ) atmospheric neutrino data by including the latest ( phase i - iv ) data as taken from @xcite .",
    "we also include for the first time the recent atmospheric data released by the icecube deepcore ( dc ) collaboration @xcite .",
    "we reproduce with good accuracy the joint bounds on the @xmath60 and @xmath61 parameters shown by dc in @xcite , under the same assumptions used therein . in this work ,",
    "the @xmath38 functions for sk and dc have been simply added . in the future , it may be useful to isolate and properly combine possible systematics which may be common to sk and dc ( related , e.g. , to flux and cross section normalizations ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the constraints on known and unknown oscillation parameters , coming from the global @xmath0 analysis of all the data discussed above .",
    "the impact of different data sets will be discussed in the next section .     from the best fit , for either nh ( solid lines ) or ih ( dashed lines ) . bounds on @xmath62",
    "are hierarchy - independent .",
    "horizontal dotted lines mark the 1 , 2 , and @xmath63 levels for each parameter .",
    "[ fig01],scaledwidth=57.5% ]    figure  1 shows the bounds on single oscillation parameters , in terms of standard deviations @xmath39 from the best fit .",
    "linear and symmetric curves would correspond to gaussian uncertainties  a situation realized with excellent approximation for the @xmath64 mass - mixing pair and , to a lesser extent , for the @xmath62 pair .",
    "the best fit of the @xmath60 parameter flips from the first to the second octant by changing the hierarchy from normal to inverted , but this indication is not statistically significant , since maximal mixing @xmath65 is allowed at @xmath66 ( @xmath67  c.l . ) for nh and at @xmath68 for ih . in any case , all these parameters have both upper and lower bounds well above the @xmath63 level .",
    "if we define the average @xmath69 error as @xmath70 of the @xmath71 range , our global fit implies the following fractional uncertainties : @xmath8 ( 2.4% ) , @xmath9 ( 5.8% ) , @xmath36 ( 1.8% ) , @xmath59 ( 4.7% ) , and @xmath60 ( 9% ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is associated to a dirac phase in the neutrino mixing matrix , which might induce leptonic cp violation effects for @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "recent fits to global @xmath2 data @xcite and partial ( lbl accelerator ) data @xcite have consistently shown a preference for negative values of @xmath11 , as a result of the combination of lbl accelerator @xmath2 and @xmath1 data and of sbl reactor data .",
    "the reason is that the lbl appearance probability contains a cp - violating part proportional to @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) for neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) @xcite .",
    "with respect to the cp - conserving case @xmath75 , values of @xmath76 are then expected to produce a slight increase ( decrease ) of events in @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) oscillations for @xmath25 fixed ( by reactors ) , consistently with the appearance results of t2k ( using both @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite ) and in no@xmath2a ( using @xmath2 @xcite ) , although within large statistical uncertainties . @xcite but with relatively low statistical significance , so that the overall preference for @xmath76 from t2k and no@xmath2a is not spoiled . ]",
    "this trend for @xmath7 is clearly confirmed by the results in fig .  1 , which show a best fit for @xmath12 ( @xmath79@xmath80 ) in both nh and ih , while opposite values around @xmath81 are disfavored at almost @xmath63 level .",
    "although all values of @xmath7 are still allowed at @xmath63 , the emerging indications in favor of @xmath82 are intriguing and deserve further studies in t2k and no@xmath2a , as well as in future lbl accelerator facilities .",
    "we remark that our bounds on @xmath7 are conservative , and that dedicated constructions of the @xmath38 distributions via extensive numerical simulations might lead to stronger indications on @xmath7 , as discussed in sec .  2 .",

    "these values are slightly lower than those reported in our previous work ( @xmath93  ev@xmath91,@xmath94 ) @xcite , as a result of altering the absolute kl spectra to account for the bump feature ( see sec .",
    "statistically , these deviations amount to about @xmath95 for @xmath8 and @xmath96 for @xmath9 , and thus are not entirely negligible .",
    "a better understanding of the absolute reactor spectra ( in both normalization and shape ) is thus instrumental to analyze the kamland data with adequate precision",

    "the bounds on the pair @xmath62 are basically unaltered , while those on @xmath59 are shrunk by more than an order of magnitude , mainly as a result of sbl reactor data .",

    "@xmath117- and @xmath118-decay data probe only the degenerate region of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively @xcite , while cosmological data are deeply probing the sub - ev scale , with upper bounds on @xmath15 as low as @xmath1220.2  ev , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein",
    ". taken at face value , the cosmological bounds would somewhat disfavor the ih case , which entails @xmath15 values necessarily larger than @xmath123  ev ( see fig .",
    "interestingly , these indications are consistent with a possible slight preference for nh from the global @xmath0 analysis ( with no@xmath2a lem data ) , as discussed at the end of the previous section .",
    "we do not attempt to combine cosmological and oscillation data , but we remark that the evolution of such hints will be a major issue in neutrino physics for a long time , with challenging implications for @xmath117-decay and @xmath118-decay searches @xcite .",

    "we have presented the results of a state - of - the - art global analysis of neutrino oscillation data , performed within the standard @xmath0 framework .",
    "relevant new inputs ( as of january 2016 ) include the latest data from the super - kamiokande and icecube deepcore atmospheric experiments , the long - baseline accelerator data from t2k ( antineutrino run ) and no@xmath2a ( neutrino run ) in both appearance and disappearance mode , the far / near spectral ratios from the daya bay and reno short - baseline reactor experiments , and a reanalysis of kamland data in the light of the `` bump '' feature recently observed in reactor antineutrino spectra .    the five known oscillation parameters ( @xmath124 ) have been determined with fractional accuracies as small as ( 2.4%,5.8%,1.8%,4.7%,9% ) , respectively . with respect to previous fits ,",
    "the new inputs induce small downward shifts of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a small increase of @xmath10 ( see fig .  1 and table  1 ) .",
    "the status of the three unknown oscillation parameters is as follows .",
    "the @xmath5 octant ambiguity remains essentially unresolved : the central value of @xmath60 is somewhat fragile , and it can flip from the first to the second octant by changing the data set or the hierarchy . concerning the cp - violating phase @xmath7 , we confirm the previous trend favoring @xmath82 ( with a best fit at @xmath29 ) , although all @xmath7 values are allowed at @xmath63 . finally , we find no statistically significant indication in favor of one mass hierarchy ( either nh or ih ) .",
    "some differences arise by changing the no@xmath2a appearance data set , from the default ( lid ) sample to the alternative ( lem ) sample .",
    "a few known parameters are slightly altered , as described in fig .  2 and table  2 .",
    "there is no significant improvement on the octant ambiguity , while the indications on @xmath7 are strengthened , and some ranges with @xmath125 can be excluded at @xmath63 level . concerning the mass hierarchy , the nh case appears to be slightly favored ( at @xmath14 c.l . ) .",
    "we have discussed in detail the parameter covariances and the impact of different data sets through figs .  38 , that allow to appreciate the interplay among the various ( known and unknown ) parameters , as well as the synergy between oscillation searches in different kinds of experiments .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the implications of the previous results on the non - oscillation observables ( @xmath126 ) that can probe absolute neutrino masses ( fig .",
    "9 ) . in this context",
    ", tight upper bounds on @xmath15 from precision cosmology appear to favor the nh case .",
    "further and more accurate data are needed to probe the hierarchy and absolute mass scale of neutrinos , their dirac or majorana nature and cp - violating properties , and the @xmath5 octant ambiguity , which remain as missing pieces of the @xmath0 puzzle .",
