    "the einstein - hilbert action has been the mainstay of gravitational theory for almost a century .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the metric of space - time ( and @xmath2 is its determinant ) , @xmath3 is the ricci tensor of that metric , @xmath4 is the cosmological constant ( in this letter we will work in planck units @xmath5 ) .",
    "an intriguing , alternative proposal for the gravitational action was proposed by eddington in 1924 @xcite .",
    "he suggested that , at least in free , de - sitter space , the fundamental field should be the connection , @xmath6 and the relevant action should be @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant with inverse dimensions to that of @xmath4 and @xmath9 is the determinant of @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath3 is constructed _ solely _ from the connection .",
    "( here and in the rest of this letter , @xmath11 represents the symmetric part of the ricci tensor build with the connection . )",
    "varying @xmath12 , integrating by parts and eliminating a vanishing trace we obtain @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the covariant derivative defined in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath15 is the inverse of the ricci tensor .",
    "this equation can be partially solved if we define a new rank-2 tensor @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "the field equations for this theory then become @xmath18 which can be rewritten as the einstein field equations if we equate @xmath19 with @xmath1 and @xmath8 with @xmath20 .",
    "hence , eddington s action should be a viable , alternative starting point to general relativity .",
    "in fact they can be viewed as being dual to each other- while @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath4 , @xmath12 is inversely proportional to @xmath4 and one can imagine that they should be useful in different regimes .",
    "eddington s theory of gravity is incomplete in that it does nt include matter .",
    "there have been subsequent attempts at coupling matter to @xmath22 in the original eddington spirit @xcite .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "start with a palatini gravitational action coupled to matter @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "here @xmath24 denotes all matter fields .",
    "the metric enters with no derivatives and it is , in principle @xcite , possible to express @xmath25 in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath24 using its own equation of motion . since this step is algebraic , one can replace this formula back into the action and obtain an  affine variational principle \" @xmath26 $ ] depending only on the connection and matter fields .",
    "the action @xmath26 $ ] derived by this procedure may be quite complicated @xcite , but it must be stressed that its dynamics is fully equivalent to the original metric theory . as a matter of fact , this procedure is most simple without matter and precisely maps the palatini version of @xmath21 into @xmath12 .    in this letter , we shall reconsider the problem of coupling eddington action to matter without insisting neither on a purely affine action nor on a theory equivalent to einstein gravity .",
    "we shall allow the metric to be present and switch to a born - infeld @xcite like structure , @xmath27 .",
    "observe that for large @xmath28 one reobtains the eddington functional .",
    "a purely metric proposal can be found in @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on a palatini formulation ( with @xmath25 and @xmath29 independent ) of the gravitational action first proposed in @xcite @xmath30&=&\\frac{2}{\\kappa}\\int d^4x \\left[\\sqrt{|g_{\\mu\\nu}+\\kappa r_{\\mu\\nu}(\\gamma)|}-\\lambda \\sqrt{g}\\right ] + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\",
    "s_m[g,\\gamma,\\psi ] \\label{ebi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is dimensionless . note that @xmath31 must be different from zero . for @xmath32 the metric variation yields ( with no matter )",
    "@xmath33^{-1 \\mu\\nu}=0 $ ] which clearly makes no sense . in @xcite",
    "the matter fields were introduced in a non - conventional way inside the square root . here",
    "we add matter in the usual way .",
    "this action has all the correct limits and no pathologies . for small values of @xmath34 , the action ( [ ebi ] )",
    "reproduces the einstein - hilbert action with @xmath35 . on the other hand for large values of @xmath36 ,",
    "the action approximates eddington s .",
    "unlike the matter actions built in @xcite and reviewed above , ( [ ebi ] ) is _ not _ equivalent to the einstein - hilbert action and we shall observe interesting deviations especially for large curvatures when eddington action dominates .    in vacuum with @xmath37 , on the other hand , the action ( [ ebi ] ) is equivalent to @xmath21 .",
    "this can be proven in two steps . with @xmath37",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath25 implies @xmath38 .",
    "we then replace the metric back into the action to obtain the eddington action @xmath39 which we already remarked is equivalent to @xmath21 .",
    "the case @xmath40 is not degenerate although this particular proof fails .",
    "for @xmath40 the equivalence can easily be proven at the level of the equations of motion .",
    "this is to be contrasted with @xmath41 theories @xcite , either metric or palatini , where deviations are observed even in vacuum",
    ". we shall now consider ( [ ebi ] ) with matter in different situations to explore it properties and we shall restrict ourselves to the case where matter _ only _ couples to the metric ( couplings to @xmath22 may arise due to quantum gravitational corrections ) .",
    "see @xcite for other discussions .",
    "the equations of motion for this theory are the following . varying with respect to @xmath25",
    "one obtains , @xmath42^ { \\mu \\nu}&- & \\lambda g^{\\mu\\nu } = -\\kappa t^{\\mu\\nu } \\label{field3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath43 is the standard energy momentum tensor with indices raised with the metric @xmath25 .",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath22 can be simplified by introducing an auxiliary metric @xmath16 compatible with @xmath22 .",
    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath44 and @xmath45 combining ( [ field4 ] ) and ( [ field3 ] ) one finds the equation @xmath46 again , here we have that @xmath47 is the inverse of @xmath48equations ( [ field4 ] ) and ( [ field5 ] ) form a complete set and provide the simplest set of equations to study this theory .",
    "the conservation equations for the matter fields are the same as in gr , @xmath49 , where the covariant derivative here refers to the metric @xmath25 .",
    "although this conservation equation is not at all obvious from the equations of motion ( [ field3 ] ) , it is nevertheless true because matter is covariantly coupled to @xmath25 .",
    "we can now rewrite equation ( [ field3 ] ) as @xmath50[{\\bf g}+\\kappa { \\bf r } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for the moment , we are writing the equation in the matrix format , @xmath51 is @xmath52 identity matrix . if we take the determinant of both sides and replace it in the field equation , we find @xmath53^{-1 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. we can solve for @xmath10 in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath54 .",
    "note that this equation is generic .",
    "recall however that @xmath10 is a function of @xmath55 ( and therefore @xmath16 ) .",
    "expanding the field equations to 2@xmath56 order in @xmath8 to find the 1@xmath57 order corrections to einstein s equations @xmath58 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 ( note that @xmath4 does not contribute to @xmath60 ) . combining this equation with the second field equation , ( [ field4 ] ) , we have the lowest order correction to einstein gravity .    with the lowest order correction in hand",
    ", we can study the non - relativistic limit .",
    "as expected , the poisson equation is modified in this theory .",
    "consider a time independent metric @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath62 only depend on @xmath63 , and an energy momentum tensor @xmath64 .",
    "we linearize equations ( [ field3 ] ) and ( [ field4 ] ) keeping terms linear in @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the full set of linearized equations are solved by @xmath67 plus the modified poisson equation , @xmath68 we come up against a key characteristic of this theory- it reproduces einstein gravity precisely within the vacuum but deviates from it in the presence of sources .",
    "we expect it therefore to play a role in regions of high density , such as within a black hole or in the very early universe .",
    "an obvious next step is to explore the inner structure of black holes .",
    "let us consider spherically symmetric configurations of the form @xmath69 as we have just remarked , in vacuum , the action ( [ ebi ] ) is fully equivalent to @xmath21 with @xmath35 .",
    "the schwarzschild - ds metric with @xmath70 and @xmath71 is thus a solution to ( [ ebi ] ) with no sources .",
    "new interesting effects show up when matter is present .",
    "the simplest form of  matter \" is an electromagnetic field ( matter in the sense that @xmath72 ) .",
    "let us add @xmath73 to the action ( [ ebi ] ) .",
    "the exact solution can be found and involves elliptic integrals .",
    "for simplicity we set @xmath40 yielding an asymptotically flat geometry .",
    "the solution is : @xmath74   \\nonumber\\\\     \\psi(r ) & \\ ! = \\ !",
    "& { r^2 \\over \\sqrt{2r^4 + 2 \\kappa q^2 } }   \\nonumber\\\\     e(r ) & \\ ! = \\ ! & { q \\over \\sqrt{r^4 + \\kappa q^2 } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the electric field .",
    "@xmath76 is the mass and @xmath77 the electric charge .",
    "observe the similitude with pure born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "for @xmath78 the electric field is everywhere regular .",
    "the metric functions and still singular at @xmath79 and at @xmath80 .",
    "this singularity is however inside the horizon .",
    "strictly speaking , this solution represents the exterior solution to a charged object . in this sense ,",
    "the @xmath79 singularity does not yet imply a singular solution . in order to explore the singularity structure of the action ( [ ebi ] ) one needs to add normal matter and study a collapsing object .",
    "a simple model is an interior cosmology glued together with an exterior schwarzschild metric .",
    "we shall discuss the details of this problem elsewhere but we can anticipate interesting conclusions : as we now show the cosmology associated to ( [ ebi ] ) predicts a maximum density and a singularity free universe .",
    "it has become clear that eddington gravity can play a role in regions of high curvature or density , the conditions one might expect in the early universe .",
    "we therefore focus now on cosmology .",
    "we shall assume a homogeneous and isotropic metric , @xmath81 coupled to an ideal fluid @xmath82 . as we remarked",
    "before , the fluid satisfies its standard conservation equation @xmath83    we can assume that @xmath84 and @xmath85 and use equations ( [ field3 ] ) and ( [ field4 ] ) to find @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath90 , we can define @xmath91 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to find the friedman equations : @xmath92    if we assume @xmath93 ( i.e. a dust filled universe with a cosmological constant ) , we can expand equation ( [ frw ] ) in terms of @xmath94 to find corrections to the late time friedman equations @xmath95\\kappa\\lambda+ { \\cal o}[(\\kappa\\lambda)^2 ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , we find that we recover conventional friedman cosmology at late times .",
    "let us now focus on the evolution of the scale factor at early times .",
    "assuming radiation domination , we have @xmath96 , @xmath97 and , definining @xmath98 we find that equation ( [ frw ] ) becomes @xmath99   \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\times   \\frac{(1+{\\bar \\rho})(3-{\\bar \\rho})^2}{(3+{\\bar \\rho}^2)^2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for small @xmath100 we recover the conventional friedman universe , @xmath101 but at high densities we come up against a novel effect : we find a stationary point , @xmath102 at @xmath103 ( for @xmath78 ) and at @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 ) .",
    "the new stationary points correspond to a maximum density , @xmath106 ; in figure ( [ h2rho ] ) we plot the @xmath107 as a function of @xmath108 within the physically acceptable region .",
    "if @xmath8 is of order unity , then we can interpret this effect as a cutoff in energy density at around the planck scale . given that @xmath109 ( recall that the conservation equation is the same as in gr , so this relation does not change in this theory )",
    ", this means that there is a minimum value for the scale factor at @xmath110 ( where @xmath111 is the scale factor today)- corresponding to a _ minimum length _",
    ", @xmath112 , in cosmology .",
    "the nature of the expansion rate at @xmath113 depends on the sign of @xmath8 as we show in figure [ aoft ] where we plot the scale factor , @xmath114 , for both situations . for @xmath105",
    ", one can show that @xmath115 which means that @xmath116 for a fixed @xmath117 .",
    "this means that at @xmath117 the universe undergoes a regular bounce .",
    "the transition through the bounce occurs on a time scale of @xmath118 . again",
    ", if @xmath8 is if order unity , the deviation from conventional cosmology occurs at the planck time on a time scale of that order .",
    "a far more interesting , in our view , behavior can be found if @xmath78 where one can show that @xmath119 which means that @xmath120 . in this case",
    "there is no bounce ; if we wind back the clock , the energy density will reach a point ( corresponding to about @xmath121 as can be seen from figure [ h2rho ] ) in which accelerated expansion kicks in .",
    "as above , this corresponds to what we would perceive as the planck time , but now , the scale factor will take an infinitely long time to reach @xmath113 .",
    "this leads to an intriguing alternative cosmology at early times in which , depending on how close its initial density is to @xmath106 , the universe loiters for a long time ( in terms of planck units ) until it emerges into a standard cosmological evolution .",
    "this evolution can be seen as an alternative incarnation of the einstein static universe at early times . as in the conventional construction",
    ", the loitering phase is unstable to expansion .",
    "there are two effects that may be of importance in the early universe .",
    "first of all , it should be clear that we have been looking at the classical behaviour of this theory of gravity .",
    "the onset of a bounce or minimum length may signal pathologies at the quantum level , such as the presence of ghosts and negative normed states .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the gravitational born - infeld action will allow us to check if these pathologies indeed exist .",
    "secondly , we have discarded the effect of @xmath4 ( i.e. @xmath122 ) in our analysis of the early universe .",
    "if , however , there is an early time contribution to @xmath4 from , for example , an inflaton , the dynamics will be different ; with @xmath123 there will be another inflection point and @xmath124 will never reach @xmath125 for a finite density .",
    "such scenario merits further analysis .",
    "eddington s theory of gravity , through its descendant , the gravitational born - infeld action , may lead to an entirely new view of the universe .",
    "as pointed out above , the presence of a maximum density in cosmology may have a bearing not only on the early universe but in the dynamical formation of black holes .",
    "thus , if a mimimum length also arises during gravitational collapse , the universe may be entirely singularity free @xcite , solving one of the problems that has troubled relativists since einstein first proposed his theory of gravity .",
