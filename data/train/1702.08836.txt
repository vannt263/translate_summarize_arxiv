    "dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) are the smallest stellar systems that contain significant amounts of dark matter .",
    "they span a wide range of properties from the more luminous ` classical ' dsphs to the recently discovered ` ultra - faint ' dsphs , with half - light radii between @xmath5 pc , total mass between @xmath6 , and luminosities between @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to mass - to - light ratios ranging from as little as 5 for some classical dsphs to as much as 5000 for the ultra - faints .",
    "these tiny systems are interesting not only for their physical diversity but also because they could be local analogs of the building blocks for larger galaxies , and can thus be used to explore the early evolution of galaxies .",
    "the research collaboration represented in this paper has already analyzed many milky way dsphs ( i.e. leo i @xcite , carina , fornax , sculptor , sextans @xcite , and draco @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on leo ii , a classical dsph located far from the center of the galaxy at 233@xmath815 kpc @xcite .",
    "most dsphs are found near the milky way ( mw ) , but leo ii instead occupies a region of space that is dominated by star - forming dwarf irregular galaxies ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to its large distance",
    ", it has often been questioned whether or not leo ii is gravitationally bound to the milky way @xcite . based off of its radial velocity and dsph morphology , it is reasonable to consider leo ii a mw satellite ( * ? ? ? * their figure 2 ) , but when taking into account the small galactocentric radial velocity component @xcite and lack of evidence for tidal disruption @xcite , it seems possible that leo ii has evolved in isolation with in the local group and is nearing the mw for the first time . in either scenario ,",
    "leo ii is an interesting case to study .",
    "since its discovery @xcite , leo ii has been the focus of many photometric studies .",
    "what started as only a few dozen individually detectable stars has evolved into massive studies of thousands of stars ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from these massive space - based and ground - based surveys",
    ", it has been concluded that leo ii has undergone little to no star formation in the last @xmath97 gyr @xcite ; red clump stars are more centrally concentrated than blue horizontal branch stars @xcite ; a mixture of stellar populations exists in the galaxy center while an older , more homogeneous population exists at larger radii @xcite ; and some minor isophotal twisting is present but there is no dynamical evidence for tidal distortion @xcite    due to the relatively large distance of leo ii from the mw , far fewer stars have been observed spectroscopically .",
    "the first velocity measurements of only two very luminous red giant stars were published by @xcite , and shortly after came a study with five carbon stars @xcite .",
    "a more extensive study was carried out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter v95 ) , which included 31 red giant branch members . based on this dataset",
    "they concluded the bulk radial motion of the dwarf to be 76.0@xmath81.3 km  s@xmath1 and the velocity dispersion to be 6.7@xmath81.1 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore they noted that the mass to light ratio in the v - band was 11.1@xmath83.8 , suggesting that the galaxy was embedded in a massive dark matter halo with mass of 9@xmath1010@xmath11 , similar to the known halo masses of other dwarfs @xcite , and consistent with more recent findings that the smallest dark matter halos are similar in mass @xcite .",
    "since then , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k07b ) expanded upon the kinematic data of leo ii , observing 200 stars and concluding 171 of them were members .",
    "the precision of the individual velocity measurements was worse than by about 1 km  s@xmath1 , but with over five times more stars , they improved the precision of the systemic velocity measurement to @xmath12 km  s@xmath1 and the dispersion to @xmath13 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "they found no velocity gradient , velocity asymmetry , or signs of rotation , and therefore concluded that the galaxy has not been affected by tides .",
    "@xcite obtained low resolution spectra of 74 leo ii stars for the purpose of better understanding the chemical composition but lacked the necessary precision to report velocity measurements to better than @xmath14 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "more recently , @xcite targeted 394 red giant branch stars in the direction of leo ii and determined 258 of them were members based on radial velocities . in a followup paper ( *",
    "* hereafter k11 ) , they focused on chemical abundances and notably derived a metallicity gradient of @xmath15 dex deg@xmath1 in leo ii , which stood in contrast to the negligible slope found by @xcite for 52 stars .    in this paper",
    "we present new spectroscopic data with high precision from a large sample of red giant branch stars in leo ii .",
    "details of our observing strategy , data reduction , and velocity extraction methods are found in section [ observations ] .",
    "section [ kin_features ] provides a kinematic analysis of the stars while section [ chem_features ] focuses on the chemistry of the stars .",
    "section [ conclusions ] contains concluding remarks and a summary of our findings .",
    "we used the 90prime imager @xcite on the 2.3-meter bok telescope at steward observatory in arizona to collect photometry of leo ii .",
    "stars were observed in the washington @xmath16 and @xmath17 filters during february 2006 .",
    "data were processed in the usual way : subtracting an average bias frame , dividing by a normalized twilight flat - field , and adding repeated observations to remove cosmic rays .",
    "after processing , we used the dophot software @xcite to get positions and magnitudes for objects in the images .",
    "the algorithm works by first fitting a user - supplied guess of the fwhm to all bright sources in the frame . after finding most of the obvious stars",
    ", it recalculates the fwhm and recomputes the brightness of each target .",
    "the magnitudes are recorded into a file along with the pixel coordinates and a set of @xmath18 values for an assumed single - star , multiple - star , or galaxy profile .",
    "we calibrated these instrumental @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitudes by transposing them to sdss apparent @xmath19 and @xmath20 magnitudes .",
    "approximately half of the stars in our sample were listed in sdss , so we used those stars to fit a three - term function relating the sdss magnitudes , our magnitudes , and a color term .",

    "this offset is well within the combined errors so we have chosen to apply no corrections to either set of velocity measurements .",
    "we choose to use the bayesian approach for all further analysis because it extracts stellar atmospheric parameters and also has a more straightforward and self - consistent estimate of the errors .",

    "we produced a sample of 25,000 stars that would exist along the line of sight toward leo ii according to the model .",
    "we then computed a generalized histogram , whereby each star is represented by a gaussian curve with unit area , centered on the listed besanon velocity and having a standard deviation equal to the median of the weighted mmt velocity errors ( 0.94 km  s@xmath1 ) .",

    "the dispersions for the stars within the bins were found by a similar method as described above except we set the systemic velocity equal to the value calculated using all leo ii member stars , which was 78.5 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these profiles can be seen in figure [ vel_disp ] .",
    "the error bars in the radial direction are the standard deviations of the radii in those bins .",
    "errors in the velocity dispersion were found using the same method described above with the covariance matrix .",

    "the reduced @xmath18 between these lines and the data are listed in the top right corners of the plots . in all cases ,",
    "the data are fit equally well by a flat line as a sloped line .",
    "additionally , the error bars on the sloped lines are large enough such that the sloped lines are indistinguishable from a constant dispersion at the 1-@xmath38 level .",

    ", we generated 10,000 monte carlo simulations with stellar positions equal to those of our observations and velocities drawn from a gaussian having standard deviation equal to the velocity dispersion of leo ii .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ bisect ] is a histogram of the amplitudes from these simulations .",
    "52% of the trials have amplitudes larger than what we find in leo ii , thus the signal we find is only significant at a 0.64 @xmath38 confidence level . from this",
    "we conclude that leo ii has no statistically significant , ordered rotation .",
    "recovered a slightly stronger signal with an amplitude of @xmath92 km  s@xmath1 and a position angle at 16.5@xmath54 .",
    "they ran similar monte carlo tests and found that 87% of the tests had an amplitude greater than 2 km  s@xmath1 with a highly variable position angle for the peak velocity signal .",
    "thus our conclusion matches that of .",
    "we also completed a test to identify if any stars clumped in 3-d ( ra , dec , radial velocity ) phase space , as such features might indicate a more interesting merger history for leo ii @xcite .",
    "we considered the similarity of velocities between stars and their nearest neighbors .",
    "for each star we counted how many of its neighbors within a given radius had velocities similar to that star .",
    "we considered radii between 10 and 50 arcseconds and velocities within 0.5 to 2 km  s@xmath1 of the central star .",
    "to understand if the number of stars in each iteration was significant , we randomly reassigned the velocities to different spatial positions 10,000 times and completed the same exercise .",
    "in all cases , no signatures of clumping were found at statistically significant levels .    having no rotation , clumps , or otherwise interesting kinematic substructure ,",
    "the only remaining dynamic peculiarity that we find in leo ii is one star located beyond the tidal radius , as can be seen in figure [ vvsr ] .",
    "the separation of this star from the dwarf center is 1.3 times the tidal radius .",
    "a couple other stars are located near the tidal radius , but only one is positioned at least 3-@xmath38 beyond that boundary .",
    "the velocity ( @xmath58=83.0 km  s@xmath1 ) , surface gravity ( log(g)=1.03 dex ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h]=-1.66 dex ) of this star are all very close to the mean values for the dwarf .",
    "while photometric studies have found stellar overdensities beyond the tidal radius @xcite , this is the first extratidal star with kinematic evidence supporting its membership .",
    "our star and the 4-star photometric clump found in @xcite are separated by @xmath59 arcmin but are both located @xmath60 arcmin from the center on the western side of the dwarf .",
    "the existence of tidal stars in other dwarfs like ursa minor @xcite and carina @xcite have been attributed to tidal disruption from the milky way .",
    "the interpretation for the tidal star in leo ii is slightly different as the dwarf galaxy is located so far away ; it is likely encountering the inner parts of the mw dark matter halo for the first time @xcite and would not yet exhibit such features .",
    "recent evidence suggests that leo ii is falling into the milky way in a tidal stream of satellites comprised of leo iv , leo v , crater , and crater 2 @xcite .",
    "the positions of both our star and the photometric clump are not aligned with the great circle that connects all five satellites , ruling out the notion that they were caused by streaming motion .",
    "instead , it seems plausible that our star and the clump in @xcite are remnants of the interactions between these satellites prior to their disruption .",
    "the best interpretation for the 4-star cluster in @xcite was that a small globular cluster merged with leo ii , which would fit with this scenario .",
    "future studies of leo ii may wish to obtain velocities for stars beyond the tidal radius for more conclusive evidence regarding the nature of these features .",
    "[ fe / h ] stellar metallicities were reported in both and .",
    "many of our stars also exist in those papers , so we completed a quick comparison to see if there were any major differences between them . in the top panel of figure [ compare_feh ] ,",
    "we plot [ fe / h ] from against our own data .",
    "the offset between them is 0.38 dex  as large as the mean scatter ",
    "so no real correlation between them can be identified . since the spectral resolution of their study was less than ours ,",
    "this result is not surprising .",
    "the comparison with is much better for low metallicities , with an offset of only 0.11 dex , but their distribution saturates at [ fe / h]@xmath61 - 1 while ours extends to higher metallicity .",
    "we inspected our spectra of these high metallicity stars and found that the sky subtraction was poor , leading to some absorption features having negative flux . as a result",
    ", these metallicity measurements got pushed to larger values .",
    "we identify 13 such stars in our sample that have metallicities larger than -0.7 dex and remove them for the remaining chemical analysis .    in figure [ mdf ]",
    "we plot the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) for our data and a separate one for as a comparison . both of these datasets have similar spatial distributions and thus we might expect the mdf to be comparable for our stars and those in .",
    "the mean metallicity weighted by the measurement uncertainties in our data is @xmath62[fe / h]@xmath63 dex .",
    "the standard deviation uncorrected for measurement errors is 0.48 dex .",
    "correcting for measurements uncertainties as done by instead yields a width of 0.40 dex .",
    "the skewness of the distribution is -0.27 , which indicates a low - metallicity tail .",
    "the ( excess ) kurtosis is -0.67 , which means the mdf is less peaked than a normal distribution , which has a kurtosis of 0 .",
    "many of these mdf characterizations are discrepant from the ones published in , who report a mean metallicity of @xmath62[fe / h]@xmath64 dex . their standard deviation and",
    "spread corrected for measurement uncertainties are 0.42 and 0.37 dex , and their skewness and kurtosis are -1.11 and 1.10 respectively , implying that our mdf is slightly wider , less peaked , and has a shorter low - metallicity tail than the mdf in .",
    "all of these features can be seen in figure [ mdf ] .",
    "strong metallicity gradients have been found in about half the classical dsphs of the mw , with the slope in leo ii being the steepest . on the other hand , reports no such gradient for leo ii . in figure [ fehvsr ]",
    "we plot the metallicity versus radius of the stars in our sample , once again excluding the 13 stars with erroneous high - metallicity measurements .",
    "we fit a flat and sloped line to the data and find that neither provides a very good fit , with reduced @xmath65 values of 7.6 and 6.3 respectively .",
    "the metallicity gradient listed in was determined by the slope of a 2-parameter best fit line ; even though our sloped line is a poor fit to the data , we continue with the analysis to provide a side by side comparison of our metallicities and those in . the best fitting sloped line to our data yielded a gradient of @xmath66 dex deg@xmath1 , or @xmath67 dex kpc@xmath1 using a distance of 233 kpc @xcite .",
    "this slope is somewhat steeper than the metallicity gradient published by , who found @xmath15 dex deg@xmath1 ( @xmath68 dex kpc@xmath1 , for a distance of 219 kpc ) .",
    "regardless of the discrepancy between the slope measurements , both indicate that there is a large metallicity gradient with metal - rich stars clustering toward the center of the galaxy .",
    "the existence of a metallicity gradient agrees with the photometric findings that red clump stars are more centrally clustered than blue horizontal branch stars @xcite .",
    "this connection arises because high- and low - metallicity red giant branch stars are , respectively , the progenitors for red clump and blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "the tendency for high - metallicity stars to be in a colder , less extended distribution than the low - metallicity stars is seen in many resolved dwarfs .",
    "for example , fornax @xcite , sculptor @xcite , and sextans @xcite .",
    "we explored the possibility that leo ii might also show different chemo - dynamic populations by first splitting the stars into two groups by the [ fe / h ] mean , such that high - metallicity stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath69 and low - metallicity stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath70 .",
    "then we plotted the velocity dispersion profiles for these selections , which can be seen in figure [ veldisp_feh ] .",
    "the dispersion for the low - metallicity stars ( blue points ) is always larger than the dispersion for the high - metallicity stars ( red points ) , but given the large error bars , the two profiles are consistent with being the same .",
    "we also calculated the overall dispersion for each of the two supposed populations .",
    "the high - metallicity stars have a velocity dispersion of @xmath71 km  s@xmath1 and the low - metallicity stars have a dispersion of @xmath72 km  s@xmath1 . once again",
    ", we find that the values suggest the high - metallicity stars are kinematically colder , but when the errors are considered it is only a @xmath73 detection .",
    "as one final test , we allowed the high and low metallicity splitting value to vary from [ fe / h ] @xmath74 dex to [ fe / h]@xmath75 dex in steps of 0.05 dex , as opposed to fixing it at the mean of -1.7 dex . in all but one case ,",
    "the high - metallicity dispersion was less than the low - metallicity dispersion , but the error bars made the results not significant beyond @xmath76 at the most .",
    "furthermore , we tried removing any stars with metallicities within 0.1 dex of the split value , as these stars might dampen the signal .",
    "the results were the same as before , though with slightly less significance .",
    "taking all of the evidence together , it seems possible that there might be a slight chemo - dynamic bifurcation whereby high - metallicity stars have a larger velocity dispersion than low - metallicity stars due to the fact that this was repeatedly the trend in our data . nevertheless , our large error bars caused by sample size and measurement error make it impossible to state this claim with more than @xmath77 confidence",
    ". a larger sample of stars with individual velocity precisions @xmath78 km  s@xmath1 will be needed to explore the question of multiple chemical populations in leo ii definitively .",
    "in total we spectroscopically observed 336 stars within leo ii and determined that 175 of them are members based on radial velocities ( @xmath79 km  s@xmath1 ) and surface gravities ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "many of the observed stars extend beyond the tidal radius of the dwarf into regions not previously studied by other publications , however only one of these extratidal stars is a member according to our constraints .",
    "other than this one star , there are no signs of tidal disruption or rotation in the dwarf . by maximizing the likelihood that the velocities of these stars were drawn from a normal distribution",
    ", we determined that the systemic velocity of the dwarf is @xmath81 km  s@xmath1 , and its velocity dispersion is @xmath2 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile is consistent with being flat even when using three different bin sizes , suggesting that leo ii is embedded in a massive dark matter halo that extends well beyond the tidal radius . using a simple king mass estimate , we determined the corresponding mass for leo ii to be @xmath50 and its mass to light ratio to be @xmath52 in solar units .",
    "the mean metallicity of the member stars is @xmath82}\\rangle=-1.70\\pm0.02 $ ] dex , which is only slightly higher than average for dsphs of the mw .",
    "the shape of the metallicity distribution function is wider , less peaked , and has a shorter low - metallicity tail than the mdf reported in .",
    "additionally , we found that leo ii has a strong metallicity gradient of @xmath66 dex deg@xmath1 ( @xmath3 dex kpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "lastly we used three different tests to look for differences in the dynamics of high- and low - metallicity stars . in all cases , the results had low signal but were consistent with a model that has correlated metallicities and kinematics .",
    "the dataset that we have compiled adds eight epochs of observation between the years 2006 and 2013 for stars in leo ii .",
    "50 of these stars were observed on more than one occasion , with the maximum number of repeat observations being 5 . combining the data from , , , and this paper , there are 372 stars that are likely members of leo ii and 196 stars with repeat observations .",
    "given the wealth of temporal radial velocity measurements , it is now possible to determine the binary fraction of stars in leo ii and evaluate the impact that these stars have on the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "this analysis will be carried out in a follow - up paper @xcite .",
