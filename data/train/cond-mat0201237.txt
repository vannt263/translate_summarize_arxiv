    "entropy is one of the most ubiquitous quantities in physics . for example , the entropy is fundamental in the study of quantum and classical information theories , applied in recent developments in telecommunications , computer science and engineering ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a great effort has been made to understand quantum entanglement of inseparable quantum system@xcite .",
    "a traditional example of a pure entangled state is the einstein - podolsky - rosen singlet state@xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect is to obtain information about the entropy of a subsystem by studying its average@xcite over pure states of the big system , in unitary haar measure .",
    "for instance , a complete pure system can be identified with a black hole and the radiation field related to it , in which case the subsystem is the black hole or alternatively the radiation field@xcite .    the standard entropy and its corresponding thermostatistics present serious difficulties when employed to study systems with long range interaction , in particular , when we deal with gravitational interactions@xcite . a possible way to overcome this kind of difficulty is considering a new entropy .",
    "as stressed by lavenda and co - workers , a newly proposed entropy should have concavity property@xcite .",
    "such an entropy was considered by tsallis@xcite .",
    "the tsallis entropy , @xmath2 recovers the usual entropy @xmath3 in the limit @xmath4 and has a definite concavity for all @xmath5 values ( @xmath6 is concave for @xmath7 and convex for @xmath8 ) .",
    "furthermore , if we consider two independent subsystems , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we have the probabilities @xmath11 , and @xmath12 in contrast with the extensive property of the usual entropy , @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath5 gives a measure of the nonextensivity induced by the tsallis entropy . in this context , it is common to employ the jargon  nonextensive \" to refer to the scenario when the tsallis entropy is present .",
    "many investigations based on the tsallis entropy have been developed .",
    "a representative set of such developments relates to self - gravitating systems@xcite , cosmic background radiation@xcite , peculiar velocities in galaxies@xcite , lvy - type anomalous superdiffusion@xcite , h theorem@xcite , turbulence@xcite , nonlinear anomalous diffusion@xcite , perturbation and variational methods@xcite , linear response theory@xcite , green s functions@xcite , and quantum entanglement@xcite ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since the tsallis entropy has played a central role in a nonextensive scenario such as those cited previously , it is natural to investigate this generalized entropy further . a different reason for investigating the tsallis entropy , @xmath6 , is to technically sneak up on ordinary entropy @xmath14 , yet avoiding its annoying logarithm by exploiting the @xmath4 limit . in any case , the aim of this work is to obtain the tsallis entropy of a subsystem averaged over all pure states of the total system using unitary haar measure to define our averaging .",
    "this result generalizes page s conjecture@xcite ( a formula for that average of the usual entropy of a subsystem ) and its subsequent demonstration@xcite .",
    "we note that page s conjecture for the average entropy of a subsystem has been applied to investigate black hole radiation@xcite ; perhaps our generalization can be useful to study parallel reductions to a subsystem in attempts to fit data with a tsallis @xmath5 distinct from 1 .    to present our generalization",

    "iii is addressed to calculate the average tsallis entropy of a subsystem .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "one way to get entropy out of a system in a pure quantum state is by a coarse graining of dividing the system into two subsystems and ignoring their correlations .",
    "take the system @xmath15 with hilbert space dimension @xmath0 and normalized density matrix @xmath16 and divide it into two subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 , of dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the entropy of system @xmath9 is @xmath18 , where the density matrix of the system @xmath9 is obtained by taking a partial trace over a total system , @xmath19 . in the same way , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "if the system @xmath15 is in a pure state , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a consequence of the fact that @xmath24 and @xmath25 have the same set of nonzero eigenvalues@xcite . unless the two systems are uncorrelated in the quantum sense ( @xmath26 , in which case @xmath27 ) , a full quantum analysis is necessary in order to obtain @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which can be cumbersome . yet",
    "it is sometimes easy to calculate the unitary haar average entropy of the subsystem @xmath9 over all pure states of the total system , @xmath30 , and consequently also the average information of the subsystem , i.e. , the deficit of average entropy from the maximum , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .    for @xmath33",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) , as well as in the following integrals , the integration limits is @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the above equation , @xmath40 is the normalization constant .    by using the identity @xmath41 and the polygamma function @xmath42 , we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) as @xmath43    taking into account that @xmath44 , we can introduce the new variables @xmath45 ; then , by using the delta function to evaluate the integral in @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 with @xmath48    page conjectured@xcite , and other authors proved@xcite , that the exact result is @xmath49 page had meanwhile applied this to calculate the information in black hole radiation@xcite .",

    "results for @xmath85 are known @xcite and the @xmath109 limit would be welcome .",
    "such further applications would be analogous to our demonstration in this present paper of page s conjecture , in being independent of the issue of whether the tsallis entropy for @xmath112 is or is not directly applicable to physical situations",
