    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are the largest satellites of the milky way ( mw ) and the nearest external system of interacting galaxies .",
    "they contain both old and young stars placing them in a favoured position in the context of studying the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the mcs are part of a bigger structure , the magellanic system ( ms ) , formed by the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , the bridge and the stream .",
    "the bridge and the stream are mainly formed by gas , and are the results of the interaction between the two clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lmc is the first step of the extragalactic distance scale , hence knowing its three - dimensional ( 3-d ) structure holds the key for a proper definition of the entire cosmic distance scale ( see walker 2012 , and references therein , for a recent review).the knowledge of the whole ms structure and of its stellar components is also of crucial importance to better understand the evolution of the two clouds , the interaction with the mw and , in turn , to improve our understanding about the formation of the galaxy and its satellites",
    ".    started in november 2009 and expected to extend beyond the originally planned @xmath25 yrs time span , the _ vista near - infrared @xmath3 survey of the magellanic system _ ( vmcmcioni / vmc ] , p.i .",
    "l. cioni , see @xcite ) is studying the star formation history ( sfh ) and the 3-d structure of the ms using both constant and variable stars for this purpose .",
    "the sfh is being recovered by means of the classical cmd - reconstruction method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the 3-d geometry is being inferred from a number of different distance indicators : the luminosity of the red clump stars , and the period - luminosity ( @xmath4 ) , period - luminosity - colour ( @xmath5 ) and period - wesenheit ( @xmath6 ) relations of the pulsating variable stars ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the rr lyrae stars belong to the oldest stellar component ( t @xmath7 gyrs ) in a galaxy and mainly trace the galactic halo , whereas the classical cepheids ( ccs ) are the youngest among the radially pulsating variables ( 50 - 200 myrs ) and mainly reside in star forming regions , galactic bars and spiral arms .",
    "these two types of pulsating variables are thus optimal to characterize the spatial structure of ms components with different ages . the vmc strategy ,",
    "its main goals and first data are described in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , first scientific results were presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "first results for the pulsating stars , based on the vmc @xmath0-band light curves , were presented in @xcite ( hereinafter r12b ) for ccs in the vmc tiles covering the south ecliptic pole ( sep ) , and the 30 doradus ( 30 dor ) regions of the lmc , and in @xcite ( hereinafter r13 ) for lmc anomalous cepheids ( acs ) . in two forthcoming papers ( moretti et al .",

    "but an important piece of information still missing are near - infrared light curves for these variables .",
    "the vmc survey is now filling this gap by obtaining @xmath0 photometry in time - series mode of the mc variables brighter than @xmath0 @xmath2 19.3 mag , with an optimal sampling of the rr lyrae stars and of cepheids with periods shorter than about 20 - 30 days ( saturation limits the observation of longer period cepheids ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe the vmc survey s @xmath0 time - series data , and outline the procedures we have developed , tested and fine - tuned to derive distances and to study the 3-d structure of the ms from the analysis of the @xmath0 light curves of cepheids and rr lyrae stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : variablesvmc ] describes the type and quality of the vmc data for the variable stars , and compares the vmc sky coverage with that of the microlensing surveys .",
    "sections  [ sec : ogle30dor ] and  [ sec : eros_lmc ] outline the analysis methods , respectively for the inner and outer lmc regions where optical data for the variable stars are available from different surveys .",
    "we compare in section  [ sec : sfh ] our results from the variable stars with the sfh results while in section  [ sec : lmc_structure ] we discuss the stellar structure of the lmc .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] provides a summary .",
    "the vmc survey is imaging @xmath2 200 @xmath8 of the ms in @xmath9 ( @xmath10=1.02 , 1.25 , and 2.15 @xmath11 m , respectively ) reaching a sensitivity limit on the stacked images close to vega magnitudes @xmath12=21.1 mag , @xmath13=21.3 mag and @xmath0=20.7 mag with a signal - to - noise ratio s / n=10 .",
    "the survey covers the lmc area ( 116 deg@xmath14 ) with 68 tiles , while 27 tiles cover the smc ( 45 deg@xmath14 ) , and 13 cover the bridge ( 20 deg@xmath14 ) .",
    "additionally , 2 tiles ( 3 deg@xmath14 ) are positioned on the stream .",
    "the vmc @xmath0-band data are taken over 12 separate epochs ( paper i ) , each reaching a limiting magnitude of @xmath15 mag with an s / n@xmath2 5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] ) .",
    "the limit reached by the single epoch data allows to comfortably detect the minimum light of the rr lyrae stars in both the lmc and the smc mag and 18.2 mag in the lmc and smc , respectively . ] .",
    "previous near - infrared surveys such as denis @xcite , 2mass @xcite and irsf / sirius @xcite were generally single epoch and in any case much shallower than vmc . for bright stars ,",

    "the @xmath0-band monitoring sequence of each vmc tile can start at any time , but once a sequence is started each subsequent observation is obtained at intervals equal to or larger than : 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 days , for epochs from 2 to 5 , and then , for epochs from 6 to 11 , at least 17 days apart .",
    "this scheduling permits good light curve coverage for both cepheids and rr lyrae stars .",
    "the vmc images are processed by the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) through the vista data flow system ( vdfs ) pipeline that performs aperture photometry of the images and computes the julian day ( jd ) of observation for each source by averaging only the jds of the pawprints in which that source was observed .",
    "the reduced data are then sent to the wide field astronomy unit ( wfau ) in edinburgh where the single epochs are stacked and catalogued by the vista science archive ( vsa ; @xcite ) .",
    "full 12-epoch time series were obtained for nineteen vmc tiles , as of july 2013 : 10 in the lmc , 4 in the smc , 3 in the bridge , and 2 in the stream .",

    "the latter tile lies in a low crowding , peripheral area of the lmc ; tile lmc 6_6 is centred instead on the well - known 30 dor star - forming region where the high crowding boosts up the photometric errors in comparison with the outer fields .",
    "two distinct sequences are visible among rr lyrae stars in tile lmc 8_3 ( blue points , see zoomed box ) .",

    "there is no particular issue , apart for a zero point smaller respect to other nights .",
    "rr lyrae stars in tile lmc 6_6 ( grey points ) also show the same dichotomy , even if it is less evident in fig .",

    "unfortunately , parts of the vmc survey s footprint is not presently covered by the microlensing surveys , leaving us to rely on the vmc data alone for the identification .",
    "the average magnitudes in the @xmath0-band , derived using a spline interpolation of the data for the ccs and the fit with templates ( @xcite ) for the rr lyrae stars , are then used to construct @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 relations that , thanks to their small intrinsic dispersions , can provide individual distances to the investigated variable stars and in turn information on the 3-d structure of the ms .",
    "the lmc / smc microlensing surveys have detected and characterized tens of thousands rr lyrae stars , ccs , binaries , and long period variables ( lpvs ) .",
    "so far , the largest spatial coverage of the lmc is that obtained by the second generation of the eros microlensing experiment ( hereinafter eros-2 , @xcite ) .",
    "eros-2 time - series data were collected in two passbands , a @xmath17 channel with @xmath18 ( 420 - 720 ) nm , that overlaps to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 standard bands , and a @xmath21 channel with @xmath22 ( 620 - 920 ) nm , that roughly matches the mean wavelength of the cousins @xmath23 band @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the median seeing of the ogle  iii images is better than the one of eros-2 images .",
    "it allows a better stars separation and measurement in highly crowded fields . for these reasons the use of the ogle  iii data was preferred wherever those data were available ( e.g. , in the regions covering the lmc central bar ) , while we are using the eros-2 data in the outer parts of the lmc that are not yet covered by other surveys . for the smc ,",

    "the ogle  iii catalogues of variable stars are publicly available at the web site , and contain light curves for 24906 rr lyrae stars and 3361 ccs in the lmc , and 2475 rr lyrae and 4630 ccs in the smc . for each object",

    "it should be noted that ogle iii has published catalogues of confirmed ccs and rr lyrae stars for both the lmc and the smc ( @xcite ) whereas for eros-2 we only have catalogues of candidate cepheids and rr lyrae stars , that we individually checked , as described in section  [ sec : eros_lmc ] .",

    "we have used both the catalogues of candidate variables provided by eros-2 and the catalogues of rr lyrae stars and cepheids published by ogle  iii and iv .",
    "for the other tiles we have used the ogle catalogues when available , otherwise we have exploited the eros-2 data .",
    "we have cross - matched the optical catalogues against the vmc deep tile ( vmcsource table ) catalogues using the vsa utilities .",
    "specifically , we used the vmc tiles coordinates as in paper i , the vmc lmc tile dimension of 1.201 degree in ra , 1.475 degree in dec , and the angular coordinates as described in @xcite to select the optical data , then we used the cross - id tool available in the vsa @xcite to match the optical and the vmc infrared catalogues .",

    "the recovery rates for the intrinsically brighter ccs are higher : 98% in the central tiles and 100% in the outer ones .",
    "tests performed on tile lmc 6_6 show that the lower completeness of the internal fields is mainly due to cepheids not recovered in the vsa vmc catalogue because are at the edges of the tile .",
    "in fact , even in this most crowded tile the completeness rises to 100% in the internal part of the tile .",
    "the lower completeness for the rr lyrae stars is instead mainly due to the high crowding in the internal regions and nebular gas emissions which limit the detection of variables as faint as the rr lyrae stars . in these conditions",
    "the psf photometry shows more accuracy and efficiency than the vsa aperture photometry , increasing the number of rr lyrae stars with vmc @xmath0 photometry .",
    "indeed , in the central part of tile lmc 6_6 the completeness of the vsa catalogue for rr lyrae stars is 82 % , but it rises to 86% for the psf catalogue . increasing the pairing radius from 0.5 to 1 arcsec , would also increase the number of cross - matches up to about 90% .",
    "however , the comparison of optical and infrared light curves , and the position in the ( @xmath0 , @xmath23-@xmath0 ) cmd reveal that 47 of 51 additional detections obtained using a pairing radius between 0.5 and 1 arcsec , are not true rr lyrae stars . therefore using a pairing radius of 0.5 arcsec in the crowded regions",
