    "the output of a one photon input state is characterized by @xmath15 the normalized output state is then given by @xmath16 the output state can be described by a displaced coherent superposition of a zero photon and a one photon component .",
    "both the displacement and the coherence depend on the complex measurement value @xmath6 .",

    "since the input photon number state has a field expectation value of zero , the field coherence in the output is a consequence of the measurement @xmath6 .",

    "this measurement creates coherence by projection onto displaced photon number states as indicated by the diagonalized form of @xmath8 in equation ( [ transfer ] ) .",
    "since the photon is the quantum mechanical equivalent of field intensity , each photon represents an addition of one quantum unit to the field fluctuations .",

    "this process is responsible for the rapid increase in coherence at low values of @xmath6 .",
