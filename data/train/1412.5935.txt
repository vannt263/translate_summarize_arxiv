    "global scaling expressions for the energy confinement time , @xmath1 , or the stored energy , @xmath2 , are powerful tools for predicting the confinement performance of burning plasmas @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the fusion performance of iter is predicted using three different techniques : statistical analysis of the global energy confinement data in the parameters ( simple ( multivariate ) linear regression tools can be used to determine the parameters from a set of data ) @xcite , @xcite , a dimensionless scaling analysis , based on dimensionless physics parameters @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and theory -based on transport models and modelling the plasma profiles @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the three methods give overlapping predictions for the performance of iter , the confidence interval of all of the techniques is still quite wide @xcite .",
    "the confinement database and modelling expert group recommended for iter design the so - called @xmath3 confinement scaling @xcite , @xcite : @xmath4 here , the parameters are the plasma current @xmath5 , the major radius @xmath6 , the inverse aspect ratio @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 denoting the minor radius of the tokamak ) , the elongation @xmath9 , the toroidal magnetic field ( at the major radius @xmath6 ) @xmath10 , the central line averaged electron density @xmath11 , the loss power @xmath12 , and the ion mass number @xmath13 , respectively . the expression ( [ i1 ] ) is valid for the elmy h - mode thermal energy confinement time .",
    "the @xmath14-linear interval was determined to be @xmath15 . by recent analyzing the enlarged @xmath16 dataset ,",
    "the practical reliability of the @xmath17 scaling was confirmed and @xmath14-linear interval was reduced to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "tables showing some of the most generally used sets of scaling parameters for the elmy h - mode and l - mode can be found in refs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    for stellarators , a similar",
    "scaling has been obtained @xcite , @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the rotational transform ( or the field line pitch ) .",
    "the confinement time is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the internal energy , the power loss and the power source , respectively . from eq.([i2a ] ) results that when the tokamak is not in the steady state the quantity @xmath1 is a time dependent quantity .",
    "hence , @xmath1 , given by eqs  ( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ i2 ] ) , is viewed as a time - dependent variable , which depends on a collection of variables _ dependent _ on time ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath25 , @xmath12 , etc ) .",
    "the value of @xmath1 at the _ steady state condition _ @xmath26 , _ attained at some time moment _ @xmath27 , corresponds to the numerical value provided by the database .",
    "for example , the point prediction for the thermal energy confinement time in iter is ( @xmath1 , @xmath28 ) = ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "the solution of this equation is in agreement with the one obtained by solving numerically the dynamic balance equations , with the aid of a transport model @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall also justify the dynamic scaling laws , like @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant and @xmath13 is the effective mass , respectively ( note that when the plasma is a mixture , due to the dependence of particle transport properties on particle mass and charge , @xmath13 is also time dependent ) . in particular , we shall prove that the dynamic expression for the energy confinement time , like eq .",
    "( [ i2b ] ) , is solution of the differential equation for @xmath1 , which can be obtained by combining eq .",
    "( [ i2a ] ) with the energy balance equation .",

    "successively , we show that this equation can also be derived from the energy balance equation , combined with definition ( [ i2a ] ) . this will allow a linking of the scaling coefficients with the ( measurable ) second time derivatives of the heat power loss , which at the leading order may also be estimated at the stationary state .",
    "these tasks will be accomplished in the section  ( [ bde ] ) . as an example of an application , in the section ( [ jetto ] )",
