    "<S> our goal is to extract new information from the experimental data on the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) process , in the region of very small @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the bfkl evolution equation ( the bfkl pomeron ) @xcite , including screening ( shadowing ) corrections@xcite , provides a good reproduction of the observed data .    </S>",

    "<S> + 2 ) for higher values of w , @xmath12 is dependent on @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the high @xmath13 data differs from the lower @xmath13 data which seems to reach a local plateau , resulting in a @xmath14 which is almost constant as a function of w.    the features of the data at low w are compatible with a dominance of the bfkl pomeron@xcite in the small @xmath11 domain of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this is readily seen when we write @xcite the bfkl generated structure function f^bfkl_2(x_b , q^2)=_f e^2_f @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the unknown normalization of the gluon distribution at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath19 is given by@xcite @xmath20 in the following we assume that @xmath19 = 0.5 , which corresponds to a resonable value of @xmath21 . at small values of @xmath1 , @xmath22 , so we can rewrite eq.(1 ) in the form f_2(x_b , q^2 ) e^- the above expression reproduces the qualitative @xmath14 features listed for the lower w , but fails to reproduce the required high energy characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> to improve the `` theoretical '' behaviour of @xmath14 at higher values of w , we introduce the shadowing correction@xcite , illustrated in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dis structure function can be represented as f_2(x_b , q^2)=f^bfkl_2 ( x_b , q^2)+f_2(x_b , q^2 ) where @xmath23 represents the changes in the bfkl structure function which result from screening .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall elaborate on the details of the screened diagram calculation , shown in fig.2 , later . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion is based on the main results of ref.@xcite which are summarized as follows : the dominant contribution of interest comes from the exchange of two bfkl ladders ( pomerons ) , while the upper blob of fig.2 is suitably given by the glap@xcite dis structure function . </S>",
    "<S> the integration over @xmath24 ( see notations in fig.2 ) results in the contribution f_2 ( x_b , q^2)= - _ f e^2_f \\ { } ^- @xmath25 where we have absorbed all nonperturbative qcd contributions in the phenomenological triple `` ladder '' vertex @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the minus sign in eq.(4 ) reflects the shadowing origin of this contribution . </S>",
    "<S> eq.(4 ) can also be derived from the calculation of the diffraction dissociation cross section using the agk cutting rules @xcite , which lead to the relation @xcite f_2 = -f^d_2 we note that @xmath27 , in the above equation , is related to the total integrated diffractive dis cross section . </S>",
    "<S> namely , to the two dis single diffraction channels , as well as the dis double and central diffraction . it has recently been suggested that these are quite large@xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the restriction implied by eq.(5 ) hinders our ability to reconstruct `` theoretically '' , the experimental high energy behaviour of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the bfkl approach , which qualitatively reproduces the low energy features , fails to do so at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from this that the necessary corrections , and therefore the diffractive component , must be quite large . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , when discussing the results of our calculation , we require that @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement is not in contradiction to the meagre dis experimental information presently available , allowing one to check @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> both zeus@xcite and h1@xcite collaborations find a sizeable diffractive component in their @xmath30 photoproduction studies . in dis , </S>",
    "<S> only single diffraction at the @xmath31 vertex has been measured@xcite@xcite , and the ratio of the measured diffraction to the total dis cross section is about 0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the non measured diffractive channels are model dependent . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of our detailed estimate of the unmeasured channels , the overall ratio obtained , is sufficiently large to justify our approach .    as stated , we take @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> seemingly , with value of @xmath19 we reach the unitarity limit@xcite , and expect the diffractive channel to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> as s - channel unitarity is not built into this formalism , we can take @xmath19 values even larger than 0.5 , provided that unitarity corrections , such as screening , are incorporated in the calculation . absorbing all the unknown factors in a new phenomenological constant @xmath33 we obtain f_2(x_b , q^2)=g_0 \\ { exp [ - ] @xmath34 we have added a ( small ) constant c to account for the remnant non bfkl contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a more detailed discussion of the diagram shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> our motivation is three fold : + 1 ) we wish to better comprehend the complicated calculation of bartels , lotter and wuesthoff@xcite and its consequences . </S>",
    "<S> + 2 ) we need to clarify how trustworthy our perturbative qcd calculation is . </S>",
    "<S> + 3 ) we need to adjust the results to the relevant kinematic domain at hera .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the expression given for our diagram in ref.@xcite f_2 = -^_0 d ^q^2_q^2_0 f^glap_2 ( , ) ^2 the integration over @xmath35 in the above expression leads to an infrared divergency as @xmath36 . however , the bfkl pomeron is associated with an anomalous dimension @xmath37 , and thus we get eq.(1 ) for which the bfkl gluon distribution is given by x_p g_bfkl(x_p , k^2)= @xmath38 ( ) ^_0e^- substituting eq.(8 ) in eq.(7 ) , we rewrite eq.(7 ) in a more compact form using new variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields f_2 = - ^y_b_0 d y_p ^r_q_0 d r f_2^glap ( , ) e^ 2 _ 0 y_p - where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to stress that the infrared divergence of the above integral should be studied in more detail . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we consider the situation where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are sufficiently large so that we can use the solution of the glap evolution equation in the region of small @xmath1 to assess @xmath47 in eq.(9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain f_2^glap = ae^2 we fix @xmath21 so as to perform our calculations in a way consistent with the bfkl equation . </S>",
    "<S> there is no danger in doing so , as the @xmath13 variation in the small @xmath1 hera kinematic region is negligible , allowing us to use this approach for the analysis of the hera data . </S>",
    "<S> we absorb all irrelevant factors appearing before the exponential in a constant factor a , which appears in front of the expression .    substituting @xmath47 in eq.(9 ) </S>",
    "<S> we reduce the equation to the form f_2 = - ^y_b_0 d y_p ^r_q_0 d r e^2 e^ 2 _ 0 y_p - it is easy to see that there is no saddle point in the integration with respect to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the equation for the saddle point is = 0 where = 2 + 2 _ 0 y_p - eqs.(12,13 ) give - - = 0 the saddle point can only be at negative values of @xmath48 , but one can not trust the bfkl equation in this domain , where the virtuality @xmath35 is less than @xmath49 . at such small values of virtualities </S>",
    "<S> there are certainly large corrections , and it does not seem reasonable to expect the bfkl pomeron description to be valid in this region .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the most important region of integration is still @xmath50 , or in other words , the dominant value of @xmath35 remains @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that the bfkl contribution is questionable and one needs to study the integral of eq.(11 ) in more detail , so as to be sure of the domain where it is valid . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that our integral over @xmath52 has a very good saddle point . indeed , the equation for this saddle point is = 0= - + 2 _ 0 + neglecting the last term , we have the saddle point value for @xmath52 y^sp_p = y_b - we now check the reliability of the glap approach for the calculation of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the typical value of @xmath53 , the argument of the anomalous dimension of the glap equation = n - 1 , where n is the moment variable . </S>",
    "<S> ] , is given by = substituting @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> the bfkl anomalous dimension is given by the series@xcite ( ) = + 2 ( 3 ) ( ) ^4 + o ( ) substituting @xmath56 , we see that the bfkl corrections are very small . </S>",
    "<S> this does not mean that we do not need the normal glap corrections , which are essential ( see ref.@xcite ) , but they can not change the main result of the present problem .    substituting @xmath57 in eq.(10 ) , we end up with the following integral over @xmath48 to be inserted in eq.(9 ) ^r_q_0 d r e^ 2 _ 0 y_b + ( r_q - r)- for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the kinematic region which is most interesting both from the theoretical and experimental points of view . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the integral over @xmath48 in eq.(19 ) is concentrated at small @xmath59 and at large @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we face the dilemma of how much trust one can put on the perturbative calculation which estimates the behaviour of the deep inelastic gluon distribution , with virtualities of the order of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , this calculation is not reliable as the problem reduces to that of the energy behaviour of the typical hadron - hadron interaction at high energy , which is described by the `` soft '' pomeron@xcite@xcite .    despite this reservation , the above statement is certainly correct if we consider only small @xmath21 and/or large @xmath61 , the @xmath62 parameters in our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the situation is more promising . indeed , as we shall show , the hera data on @xmath14 @xcite@xcite confirm the theoretical expectation that the bfkl pomeron with @xmath19 = 0.5 contributes at low @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> substituting @xmath19 = 0.5 we obtain a typical value of @xmath63 , in the integral of eq.(19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is sufficiently large to justify our using pqcd , to evaluate the diagram of fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath64 6 is larger than the value of @xmath45 in hera kinematic region , so we can estimate the value of the integral in eq.(19 ) as @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> collecting all factors together , we obtain eq.(4 ) , which was used in our description of the hera data .    </S>",
    "<S> detailed comparisons of our calculations with the data@xcite@xcite are displayed in fig.3 where we present @xmath12 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we did not attempt a `` best fit '' , nevertheless , our ability to reproduce the gross features of the data is evident . </S>",
    "<S> the following comments relate to the data choice and detailed features of our fit : + 1 ) the data considered are bounded by @xmath66 and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> + 2 ) the following parameters were used in the numerical fit : @xmath33 = 0.024 , + @xmath68 = 0.015 @xmath69 , @xmath70 = 1 @xmath71 and c = -0.025 . with these parameters </S>",
    "<S> we get that @xmath72 at @xmath13 = 8.5 @xmath69 and @xmath73 250 @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we can reproduce the data with a @xmath29 which is smaller , but , clearly , our requirement for a relatively large dis diffractive component is essential for this approach . </S>",
    "<S> + 3 ) as can be readily seen from fig.3 , we obtain a reasonable description of the data down to values of @xmath74 . at smaller values of @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> we require larger sc to reproduce the data .    </S>",
    "<S> our inability to reproduce the lowest @xmath13 data is not surprising . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the present approach is over simplified , as we fail to take into account the different effects of the sc on the diffractive and the total dis cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we call attention to the observation@xcite@xcite that in soft hadron interactions @xmath75 whereas @xmath76 . as we have shown@xcite the strength of the sc in pqcd </S>",
    "<S> is determined by a parameter @xmath77 $ ] , where b is the elastic slope . at low @xmath13 , @xmath78 , and we doubt the validity of eq.(5 ) , which is at the core of our calculation . nevertheless , even when @xmath79 , one can still use eq.(3 ) with @xmath23 as defined in eq.(4 ) , and obtain a better assessment of @xmath14 at low @xmath13 than the one we have presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is , that the sc to the total dis cross section turns out to be smaller than the sc to diffraction dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is connected to the broader issue of the transition between the ( hard ) pqcd and the ( soft ) non perturbative domain , which we plan to discuss in a forthcoming publication . </S>",
