    "among the eclipsing binary stars , detached double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( dbs ) are the most important sources in order to obtain the main physical properties of stars precisely .",
    "they are also valuable to test the models of stellar structure and evolution and also improve basic relationships between absolute parameters of stars . for these reasons ,",
    "dbs were preferred for this study to present the distributions of main parameters , improve mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) and also suggest an alternative method to determine effective temperatures of eclipsing binaries .",
    "a calibration sample was compiled by selecting main - sequence stars with accurate masses , radii and effective temperatures from the recent database of dbs by eker et al .",
    "( 2014a ) .",
    "we selected 298 stars with masses and radii accurate to @xmath0 3% among 257 dbs in the catalogue . using the data , we improved the classical mlr for the full mass range ( 0.2 @xmath1 m / m@xmath2 @xmath0 31 ) and also four mass domains , as indicated in fig .",
    "1 . the mass - radius ( mr ) and",
    "mass - effective temperature relations are also investigated . due to the evolutionary effects ( m @xmath31m@xmath2 ) , a single function to represent mr relation would be meaningless .",
    "the evolution on the main - sequence band is not seen obvious on the m - t@xmath4 diagram .",
    "therefore , it was thought that the effective temperature could be re - calculated by using the updated mlr in different stellar mass domains .",
    "we improved the classical mlr for different mass domains with linear equations .",
    "our investigation of @xmath5 on classical mass - luminosity relation ( l@xmath6m@xmath7 ) for various mass ranges on the main - sequence was presented .",
    "a practical method was suggested to compute effective temperature if mass and radius of a star are known . with the calculated temperatures , the stellar temperature evolution within the main - sequence band for stars with m",
    "> 1m@xmath2 is clearly visible on the @xmath8 diagram .",
    "the details of the study and also the updated classical mass - luminosity relations are given by eker et al .",
