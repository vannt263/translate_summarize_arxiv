    "the behavior of the heavy quarkonium states in hot strongly interacting matter was proposed as test of its confinement status , since a sufficiently hot deconfined medium will dissolve any binding between the quark - antiquark pair @xcite .",
    "another possibility of dissociation of certain quarkonium states ( subthreshold states at @xmath0 ) is the decay into open charm ( beauty ) mesons due to in - medium modification of quarkonia and heavy - light meson masses @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in hadronic reactions occurs in part through production of higher excited @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) states and their decay into quarkonia ground state .",
    "since the lifetime of different subthreshold quarkonium states is much larger than the typical life - time of the medium which may be produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions their decay occurs almost completely outside the produced medium .",
    "this means that the produced medium can be probed not only by the ground state quarkonium but also by different excited quarkonium states . since different quarkonium states have different sizes ( binding energies )",
    ", one expects that higher excited states will dissolve at smaller temperature than the smaller and more tightly bound ground states .",
    "these facts may lead to a sequential suppression pattern in @xmath1 and @xmath2 yield in nucleus - nucleus collision as the function of the energy density .    here",
    "we will discuss heavy quarkonium dissociation below the deconfinement point where it is due to in - medium modification of the open charm ( beauty ) threshold @xcite as well as above the deconfinement point due to the well known screening phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath1 production in hadron - hadron collision is to a considerable extent due to the production and subsequent decay of higher excited @xmath3 states @xcite .",
    "the feed - down from higher excited states was systematically studied in proton - nucleon and pion - nucleon interactions with @xmath5 incident proton ( pion ) beams @xcite . in these studies",
    "the cross sections for direct production of different charmonium states ( excluding feed - down ) were measured . then making use of the known branching ratios @xmath6 = 0.27 \\pm 0.02 $ ]",
    ", @xmath7 = 0.14 \\pm .01 $ ] , and @xmath8 = 0.55 \\pm 0.05 $ ] , one obtains the fractional feed - down contributions @xmath9 of the different charmonium states to the observed @xmath1 production ; these are shown in the second and third columns of tab . 1    in the case of bottomonium the experiment provides only the inclusive ( i.e. including also the feed - down from higher states ) cross section for different @xmath10 states @xcite . the feed - down from @xmath11 states",
    "is known only for transverse momenta @xmath12 @xcite . to analyze the complete feed - down pattern",
    ", we thus have to find a way to extrapolate these data to @xmath13 as well as to determine the direct cross section for different @xmath10 states .",
    "this can be done using the most simple and general model for quarkonium production , the color evaporation model @xcite . in particular",
    "this model predicts that the ratios of cross sections for production of different quarkonium states are energy independent .",
    "this prediction was found to be true for a considerable range of energies @xcite .",
    "the ratios between the different @xmath14 states in this model are predicted to be governed essentially by the orbital angular momentum degeneracy @xcite ; we thus expect for the corresponding cross - sections _ 0(1p ) : _",
    "2(1p ) = 1 : 3 : 5 .",
    "[ 2.3 ] from table 1 we have for @xmath15 collisions @xmath16 and thus reasonable agreement with the predicted ratio 1.67 .",
    "actually , for @xmath17 interactions , the experiment measures only the combined effect of @xmath18 and @xmath19 decay ( 30 % of the overall @xmath1 production ) ; the listed values in tab .",
    "1 are obtained by distributing this in the ratio 3:5 .",

    "( 1 ) , the feed - down from higher excited @xmath4 states to @xmath2 production can be predicted @xcite ; the feed - down fraction are summarized in tab.1 .",
    "alternatively the feed - down fraction from higher excited @xmath4 states can be predicted using nrqcd factorization formula @xcite .",
