    "recently , the spectroscopic study of @xmath2 and @xmath3 hyperon resonances with strangeness @xmath17 ( correctively referred to as @xmath18 ) has made significant progress .",
    "this advance mainly comes from using sophisticated coupled - channels approaches  @xcite to perform comprehensive partial - wave analyses of the existing data of @xmath19 reactions in a wide energy region from their thresholds to a rather high energy with the invariant mass @xmath20 gev . with this analysis , it was realized the systematic extraction of @xmath18 resonances defined by poles of the scattering amplitudes in the complex - energy plane .",
    "it has been established  @xcite that the resonance poles can be identified with the ( complex-)energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the underlying fundamental theory , which are obtained under the purely outgoing wave boundary condition . thus the @xmath18 resonance parameters extracted through the coupled - channels analyses of refs .",

    "we consider the dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model developed in ref .",

    "this model was developed by extending the theoretical framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was originally formulated to study @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 reactions in the nucleon resonance region  @xcite , to include the meson - baryon channels with strangeness @xmath17 . within this dcc model ,",
    "the @xmath25-matrix elements for each partial wave can be obtained by solving the following coupled integral equation  @xcite : @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the invariant mass of the reaction ; the subscripts @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 represent the four two - body channels ( @xmath9 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ) and the two quasi - two - body channels ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) that can decay into the three - body @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels , respectively ; @xmath40 is the magnitude of the momentum of channel @xmath29 in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame ; @xmath41 is the green s function of channel @xmath31 ; @xmath42 is the mass of the @xmath43th bare excited hyperon state @xmath44 included in the given partial wave ; @xmath45 represents the hadron - exchange potentials derived from the effective lagrangian that respects the su(3 ) flavor symmetry ; and the bare vertex interaction @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) defines the @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) transition .",
    "the model parameters contained in the potential @xmath50 were fixed by fitting more than 17,000 data of both unpolarized and polarized observables of the @xmath51 reactions . as a result , we obtained two distinct sets of the model parameters , referred to as model a and model b. both models describe the existing @xmath19 reaction data equally well over a wide energy range from the thresholds up to @xmath52  gev . from model",
    "a ( model b ) , 18 ( 20 ) of @xmath18 resonances were extracted in the energy region above the @xmath9 threshold and below @xmath52 gev .",
    "it is found that some of the extracted low - lying @xmath18 resonances may correspond to one- and/or two - star resonances assigned by particle data group  @xcite or may be new resonances .",
    "furthermore , two @xmath53 @xmath2 resonances are found below the @xmath9 threshold in both model a and model b , which is similar to the results from the chiral unitary models ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the jlich model  @xcite .",
    "although a number of new and/or unestablished low - lying @xmath18 resonances were found in the dcc analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , their existence and pole - mass values are rather different between model a and model b. this is of course due to the fact that the existing @xmath19 reaction data used in the analysis are _ incomplete _ , as discussed in refs .",
    "in addition , there is a limitation of using the @xmath19 reaction data for establishing low - lying @xmath18 resonances because the @xmath19 reactions can not directly access the energy region below the @xmath9 threshold , and also it is practically not easy to measure precisely the @xmath19 reactions in the energy region just above the @xmath9 threshold where the incoming-@xmath54 momentum becomes very low .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to overcome this limitation would be a combined analysis of the @xmath19 reactions and the @xmath55 reactions .",

    "we focus on the kinematics that the incoming @xmath54 has a rather high momentum of @xmath63  gev and the outgoing nucleon @xmath57 is detected at very forward angles with @xmath64 , which is the same as the setup of the j - parc e31 experiment  @xcite . at this",
