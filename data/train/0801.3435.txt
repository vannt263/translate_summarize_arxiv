    "the nucleus of female mammals embryo cells contain two x chromosomes ; one of these has to be inactivated in order to equalize the dosage of x genes product with respect to males , and this inactivation is crucial to survival @xcite .",
    "moreover , the x chromosome is conjectured to play a key role in the arising of certain types of cancer @xcite .",
    "the mechanism by which one of the two x chromosomes is inactivated is poorly understood , despite extensive work on this problem @xcite ; it is known that co - localization of chromosomes at the time x - chromosome inactivation ( xci ) is established plays a key role @xcite .",
    "very recently , nicodemi and prisco @xcite proposed a model to explain xci on the basis of a spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism , related to the classical ising model of statistical mechanics , in a dynamical stochastic model of the single - agent type .",
    "their idea is that blocking factor ( bf ) molecules diffuse in the cell and can bind randomly to one or the other of the x - chromosomes ; however , by a collective effect , the affinity to a chromosome increases when this already binds to other bf molecules .",
    "the net effect is that once one of the two chromosomes , by the effect of a fluctuation , binds to a larger number of bf molecules , it will bind to more and more of these  at a rate higher than the other chromosome ( note that the bf molecules could have a greater probability to escape when more of them bind to the chromosome ; this effect should be dominated by the growth in affinity in order for the collective effect devised by nicodemi and prisco to set in ) . in the whole , as a result of diffusive behavior , fluctuation and the affinity - enhancing collective effect , a net current will be established leading to bf concentration on one of the two x - chromosomes .    the model can also account for the relevance of co - localization at the establishment of xci ; in facts , if the two x - chromosomes are too far away , the diffusive behavior will prevail , and the bf molecules escaping from the less populated x - chromosome will have a very low probability to reach the other one .",
    "the purpose of this short note is to provide a deterministic ( simplified ) version of the nicodemi - prisco symmetry - breaking xci model , considering average exchanges of blocking factors between each of the two x - chromosomes and the cell fluid environment .",
    "thus our model will amount to a mean - field version of the nicodemi - prisco model ; we will formulate it first in terms of transition probabilities between states for a single bf molecule , and then pass to a formulation in terms of a first order system of odes , i.e. a dynamical system @xcite , following a procedure which is standard in physics or in quantitative biology @xcite .    here",
    "we will consider the fluid environment as a homogeneous reservoir , i.e. overlook the effects connected with the spatial localization of the x - chromosomes ; thus the model will be able to predict the symmetry breaking leading to inactivation of one of the x - chromosomes , but ( in its simplest form , presented here ) not its dependence on co - localization of the chromosomes .",
    "an extension of the model aiming at including co - localization effects will be developed in forthcoming work .",
    "similarly , here we will only deal with average quantities and flows ; fluctuations can be included within this kind of modeling by promoting the odes we obtain to _ stochastic differential equations _",
    "@xcite , as briefly discussed below .",
    "we will consider a fixed total amount ( @xmath0 units ) of bf molecules ; these can be in three mutually exclusive states : they can bind to one ( state 1 ) or the other ( state 2 ) of the two x - chromosomes , or be diffusing in the cell environment ( state 3 ) .",
    "we denote the number of units binding to the first x - chromosome at time @xmath1 as @xmath2 , that of units binding to the second x - chromosome at time @xmath1 as @xmath3 , and that of units diffusing in the cell fluid at time @xmath1 as @xmath4 . we will refer to @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the _ occupation numbers _ for the two x - chromosomes ( or more precisely , for the xic of the chromosomes ) .",
    "obviously , [ totnumber ] x(t ) + (t ) + z(t )  =  n  .",
    "let us consider the probabilities @xmath7 for transitions between these states  in particular , transition from state @xmath8 to state @xmath9  for each bf molecule ( referred to as a `` particle '' in the following ) in a time interval of length @xmath10 . in the following , we will use a simplified notation , and write [ probshort ] p_ij  : =  p(i j , t )  .",
    "we assume that for @xmath11 sufficiently small , the probability a particle initially in state 3 will end up being in state 1 or 2 ( i.e. bound to one of the two x - chromosomes ) is [ prob1 ] p_31 ( x ) t + o ( t )  ;  p_32 (  ) t + o ( t )  .",
    "that is , it will be proportional to the length of the time interval ( but independent of time @xmath1 itself ) via a function @xmath12 or @xmath13 representing the affinity with the concerned x - chromosome and depending on the number of particles already binding to it .",
    "similarly , the probability that a particle initially binding to one of the x - chromosomes will escape from it in a time interval @xmath11 will be given by [ prob2 ] p_13 ( x , z ) t + o ( t )  ;  p_23 (  , z ) t + o ( t )  .",
    "that is , the escape probability will be proportional to the length of the time interval via a function of the number of particles binding to the concerned x - chromosome and of the number of particles fluctuating in the fluid environment ( it is natural to assume these should enter only through their density @xmath14 ) .",
    "as for direct transitions from one to the other of the two x - chromosomes , these will be impossible on account of their non - zero space separation ( the particle will have to diffuse through the fluid to do that ) , so we will set [ prob3 ] p_12  =  o ( t )  ;  p_21  =  o ( t )  .",
    "needless to say , the probabilities of permanence in a given state are obtained simply requiring the conservation of particles , i.e. that the sum of probabilities for all transitions from a given state to all possible state is one ( markov property ) ; thus [ prob4 ]    rl p_11  = & 1 - p_12 - p_13 = 1 - ( x , z ) t + o ( t )  , + p_22  = & 1 - p_21 - p_23 = 1 - (  , z ) t + o ( t )  , + p_33  = & 1 - p_31 - p_32 = 1 - [ ( x ) + (  ) ] t + o ( t )  .",
    "let now @xmath15 be the average occupation numbers for states @xmath16 at time @xmath1 ; we look at the average occupation numbers at time @xmath17 .",
    "note @xmath18 can be expressed using , hence we need only two equations .",
    "these will be given by [ eveq1a ]    rl x ( t+ t ) = & x(t ) - p_13 x(t ) + p_31 z(t )  , + y ( t+ t ) = & y(t ) - p_23 y(t ) + p_32 z(t )  .    using the expressions given above for @xmath19  and omitting @xmath20 terms  the yield [ eveq1 ]    rl x ( t+ t ) = & x(t ) + [ ( x(t ) ) z(t ) - ( x(t),z(t ) ) x(t ) ] t + y ( t+ t ) = & y(t ) + [ ( y(t ) ) z(t ) - ( y(t),z(t ) )",
    "y(t ) ] t  .    dividing by @xmath11 and letting @xmath21 , eq .",
    "yields a system of odes describing the evolution of the average occupation numbers for the three states ( in which we make explicit the expression of @xmath18 implied by the conservation law ): [ eveq3 ]    rl d x / dt = & ( x ) ( n - x - y )  -  ( x , n - x - y ) x  , + d y / dt = & ( y ) ( n - x - y )  -  ( y , n - x - y ) y  .",
    "passing to consider the densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and introducing the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 defined through a ( w ) : = ( n w )  ,  b(w_1,w_2 ) : = ( n w_1,n w_2 )  , we get in the end the equations ( symmetric under the exchange of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) [ eveq4 ]    l d x / dt  =  a(x ) ( 1-x - y )  -  b(x,1-x - y ) x  , + d y / dt  =  a(y ) ( 1-x - y )  -  b(y,1-x - y ) y  .",
    "so far we have worked in completely general terms within the three - states description of the system . in order to have a specific model , we should choose concrete forms for the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29  and hence of the @xmath30 and @xmath31  describing the probability of capture by and escape from chromosomes in function of the associated occupation numbers @xmath32 or densities @xmath33 ; this will yield a specific expression for the evolution equations and .",
    "in their work , nicodemi and prisco @xcite argued that the essential feature of their model for xci is the collective phenomenon enhancing affinity and hence the probability of capture by x - chromosomes with a substantial number of binding particles .",
    "thus the function @xmath34 should go to a finite limit @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( the bf have a non - zero affinity with the chromosomes even when no bf molecules are binding to chromosomes , and more generally when the collective behavior has not set in ) , and grow with @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 .    as for @xmath39",
    ", we should similarly have a function with a finite limit @xmath40 for @xmath36 ; as for its dependence on @xmath37 and @xmath41 , we assume it is only through the ratio @xmath42 of bf molecules binding to the chromosome and bf molecules in the fluid environment .    in the following ,",
    "we choose to deal with a ",
    "minimal  model , i.e. consider a linear dependence on @xmath43 for both these quantities ; we set [ ab ] ( w ) = a_0 + a_1 w  ,  ( w ) = b_0 + b_1 ( w / z )  ; this implies of course a ( w ) = a_0 + a_1 n w  ,  b ( w ) = b_0 + b_1 ( w / z )  .",
    "the parameters @xmath44 are all positive ( we could always set one of these parameters equal to one by rescaling the time unit . ) we also stress that in view of the discussion by nicodemi and prisco @xcite , we should expect the cooperative effects enhancing affinity should be predominant over those depressing the escape rate ; this means we should expect @xmath45    rl d x / d t = & ( a_0 + a_1 n x ) ( 1 - x - y )  -  [ b_0 + ( b_1/(1 - n(x+y ) ) ) n x ] x  , + d y / d t = & ( a_0 + a_1 n y ) ( 1 - x - y )  -  [ b_0 + ( b_1/(1 - n(x+y ) ) ) n y ] y  .",
    "we are specially interested in the large @xmath46 regime . in order to study this , it is convenient to rescale time ( note that eqs . become singular for @xmath47 ) and pass to consider as independent variable  : =  n t  .",
    "we also set  : =  1/n ( hence @xmath48 ) ; the equations read then [ eqseps ]    rl d x / d = & a_1 ( 1 - x - y ) x + [ a_0 ( 1 - x - y ) - b_0 x ]  +   b_1 x^2 ( x+y - ) ^-1  , + d y / d = & a_1 ( 1 - x - y ) y + [ a_0 ( 1 - x - y ) - b_0 y ]  +   b_1 y^2 ( x+y - ) ^-1  ;    at first order in @xmath49 , we have [ eqslim ]    rl d x / d = & a_1 ( 1 - x - y ) x  +   [ a_0 ( 1 - x - y )  -  ( b_0 - b_1 x /(x+y ) ) x ]  , + d y / d = & a_1 ( 1 - x - y ) y  +   [ a_0 ( 1 - x - y )  -  ( b_0 - b_1 y /(x+y ) ) y ]  .",
    "we want now to discuss some point concerning the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system defined by ; we should consider it in the region ( invariant under the dynamics ) of @xmath50 delimited by the coordinate axes and by the line @xmath51 .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     obviously dominance of fluctuation in the dynamics will take place once the system gets near  or very near if @xmath52 is small  to the stable equilibrium point @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "there will be a metastable equilibrium distribution around @xmath55 and  over extremely long times ",
    "large fluctuations could drive the system near to the other stable equilibrium ; the equilibrium distribution and the time needed for large fluctuations to appear can be estimated via standard stochastic processes techniques @xcite .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show a numerical simulation of ( the stochastic process defined by ) the stochastic differential equations .",
    "we have provided a mean - field formulation of the model recently proposed by nicodemi and prisco @xcite for the x - chromosome inactivation in mammals @xcite .    like their model",
    ", the version proposed here explains @xmath56-chromosome inactivation as the result of a _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ in the dynamics of blocking factors molecules binding to the x - chromosome inactivation centers ( xic ) .",
    "while their approach was based on a single - agent model , in our version the considered equations deal directly with average quantities .    after discussing a general formulation of the model",
    ", we considered a minimal version , in which the affinity grows linearly with the number of bf molecules already binding to the xic and the rate of escape of bf molecules increases linearly on the ratio between density of bf molecules binding to the x - chromosomes and of bf molecules floating in the fluid environment with the same number .",
    "our model contains four positive parameters , related to affinity and escape probability for the bf molecules .",
    "we showed that when @xmath57 , non - symmetric equilibria exist ; under the same condition they are stable ( while symmetric equilibria are unstable ) .",
    "thus in such case we have a _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ , i.e. non - symmetric equilibria describe the asymptotic state of the system .",
    "we were also able to estimate the rate of approach to equilibrium as a function of the parameters describing the system and the total bf population .",
    "a qualitative discussion showed that when the initial situation corresponds to most of the bf molecules floating in the fluid , one should expect the dynamics to undergo different phases .",
    "we ran some numerical simulations ( one of these is shown in the figures ) confirming the conclusions reached by the qualitative discussion mentioned above .",
    "we also briefly discussed how fluctuations can be taken into account within our scheme .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that our model differs from that of nicodemi and prisco only in the mathematical description it considers , while the physical basis is the same .",
    "thus , we are just providing an alternative description  in terms of dynamical systems and odes rather than of stochastic processes  for the physics described by nicodemi and prisco in their paper @xcite .",
    "this mathematically simpler description allows to make more detailed predictions , in particular about different timescales in the dynamics ; these were fully confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "our model , like the one of nicodemi and prisco @xcite , did not take into account co - localization ; work is in progress to take this into account within the present description of x - inactivation .",
    "in this appendix we will briefly discuss the passage from the physical model of section [ sec : model ] to the stochastic differential equations and .    in order to take into account full detail of fluctuations in our model",
    ", we should consider the flows @xmath58 of particles from state @xmath8 to state @xmath9 . denoting by @xmath59 the number of particles passing from state @xmath8 to state @xmath9 in a time interval of length @xmath60 , we have of course _ ij = _ ij - _ ji  .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath19 for a single particle are given in section [ sec : mod : tp ] ; the @xmath61 will thus be poisson distributed with parameter @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the population of state @xmath8 at the beginning of the time interval .",
    "needless to say , if we look just at expectation values we obtain again ; however , our present task is to go beyond this level of description , and take into account first and higher order momenta of the poisson distribution  that is , in physical terms , _ fluctuations _ around the average dynamics .",
    "let us fix our attention , for the sake of concreteness , on the population @xmath56 ( or density @xmath22 ) of the state 1 and its variation @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) in a time interval of length @xmath10 ; we also write @xmath41 and @xmath66 rather than expressing these quantities in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , for ease of notation .",
    "we obviously have @xmath69 .",
    "recall that @xmath70 is poisson distributed with parameter @xmath71 ( i.e. @xmath72 ) , and @xmath73 is also poisson distributed but with parameter @xmath74 .",
    "thus @xmath75 is poisson with mean @xmath76 and variance @xmath77 .",
    "thus for @xmath56 we have the stochastic differential equation @xmath78 ; in the case of our minimal model this reads d x = [ ( a_0 + a_1 x ) z - ( b_0 + b_1 x / z)x ] d t + d ( t )  . passing to density variables this reads @xmath79 d t   + n^{-1}[(a_0 + a_1 n x ) - ( b_0 + b_1 x / z ) n x ] ^{1/2 } d \\om(t)$ ] ; we should also pass to the rescaled time variable @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "in this way we get , using again @xmath83 , d x = [ a_1 x z + ( a_0 z - ( b_0 + b_1 x / z ) x ] d + d ( )  .",
    "we thus have a noise of intensity @xmath84 ; note that at order zero in @xmath49 , @xmath85 ; as the sum of @xmath26 and @xmath66 can not be higher than one , this can be estimated by @xmath86 ."
