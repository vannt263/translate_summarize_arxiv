    "in this paper we report about our recent work on hidden charm molecules in finite volume.@xcite lattice qcd ( lqcd ) is becoming an increasingly powerful tool to study the hadron spectrum from a theoretical point of view .",
    "one of the tools becoming gradually more used is the analysis of lqcd levels in terms of the lscher method.@xcite this method converts binding energies of a hadron - hadron system in the finite box into phase shifts of the hadron - hadron interaction from levels above threshold , or binding energies from levels below threshold .",
    "recently , this method has been generalized@xcite by using the on - shell factorization scheme used in the unitary chiral approach.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to study the possibility of finding heavy  meson molecules , predicted long time ago,@xcite in future lqcd simulations . to study these states , we shall follow the formalism of ref .  , where an effective field theory incorporating light su(3)-flavor and heavy - quark spin symmetries to describe charmed meson - antimeson interactions is formulated , generalizing the work of ref .  .",
    "in studying such molecules in finite volume our objective is twofold .",
    "first , by putting the model in a box , we make predictions about the interacting energy levels that could be tested in actual lqcd simulations , as that of the work in ref .  .",
    "second , we will propose several methods to face the problem of analyzing the energy levels predicted with the model ( `` inverse problem '' ) , as it would be done if they were real lqcd results .",
    "to study the interactions between charmed mesons , we use the formalism derived in refs .  .",
    "the ( non - relativistic ) @xmath0-matrix for the charmed mesons scattering is written as : @xmath1 in this equation , @xmath2 is the reduced mass of the two - meson system , @xmath3 is the momentum , @xmath4 is the energy , @xmath5 is the phase shift , @xmath6 is a one - loop function , and @xmath7 is the interaction potential . the loop function @xmath6 provides the right - hand or unitarity cut ( rhc ) , and the contributions of the left - hand cut ( lhc ) , if any , are included in the potential @xmath7 .",
    "the loop function @xmath6 is regularized by means of a gaussian form factor with a cutoff @xmath8 , and it is given by : @xmath9    in the approach of refs .",
    ", the leading - order ( lo ) interaction comes from contact terms , and the potential in eq .",
    "[ eq : tmat ] is written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "hqss and light - flavour su(3 ) symmetry reduce the number of independent constants to only four so that , for each channel , the constant @xmath11 is the appropriate linear combination of these four independent constants . for these constants",
    ", we take the values given in ref .  .",
    "a more complete description of the formalism can be found in ref .  .",
    "in particular , there",
    "they are discussed the absence of any contribution to the lhc in the lo potential , and the role of the cutoff @xmath8 .    the amplitude in a box of size @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath13 ,",
    "is written from eq .   by replacing the integral of the loop function @xmath6 with a discrete sum over the allowed momenta @xmath14 ( periodic boundary conditions ) , giving rise to a new function , @xmath15 : @xmath16 now , the energy levels in the box are given by the poles of the @xmath13-matrix , @xmath17 .",
    "for the energies of these levels , the amplitude in the infinite volume is recovered as : @xmath18 further discussions about the finite volume aspects of the formalism are to be found in ref .  .",
    "in particular , there it is delivered an analytic treatment of the dependence of the @xmath19 function on the cutoff @xmath8 and its relation with the lscher function @xmath20 .",
    "additionally , there can also be found a discussion about the absence of the lhc in our approach and the the finite volume effects the latter could produce .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 interaction . ( c )",
    "phase shifts for this interaction.[fig : pi],title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] + ( a )     @xmath21 @xmath22 interaction .",
    "( c ) phase shifts for this interaction.[fig : pi],title=\"fig:\",height=128 ] + ( b ) +   @xmath21 @xmath22 interaction .",
    "( c ) phase shifts for this interaction.[fig : pi],title=\"fig:\",height=128 ] + ( c )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi](a ) we show the energy levels obtained from the poles of the @xmath13-matrix as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "we only show those levels that correspond to bound states in the infinite volume case .",
    "an attractive interaction in a finite volume generates subthreshold energy levels . in the infinite volume case",
    ", these energy levels can asymptotically tend to threshold or , instead , become bound states . as said before",
    ", the finite volume energy levels found here could be compared with those obtained in real lqcd simulations . in an actual lqcd simulation ,",
    "however , one would obtain a finite ( and typically , small ) number of points scattered on fig .",
    "[ fig : pi](a ) , rather than the theoretical continuous curves shown . then , some of the levels shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pi](a ) could be safely identified with bound states , asymptotically different from threshold , but other energy levels could not .",
    "hence , it becomes necessary to analyze the energy levels in some manner , as we do next .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi](b ) , we show the first two energy levels ( below and above threshold ) for the case of the @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 interaction . for this channel ,",
    "the infinite volume model predicts a bound state with mass @xmath24 .",
    "the energy levels in the box , predicted by the model , are given by the red solid lines .",
    "the subthreshold level tends for @xmath25 to the bound state mass . from the theoretical levels , we generate _ synthetic data _ ( see ref .   for details ) , shown by the points with its errors .",
    "we analyze these points as if they were actual lqcd data ( inverse analysis ) .",
    "the first method of analysis consists in obtaining the phase shifts from the upper level of fig .",
    "[ fig : pi](b ) , with the standard lscher s formula .",
    "the phase shift so obtained for each point of the upper level is shown with the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi](c ) . from the phase shifts ,",
    "then , one calculates the effective range parameters . the green band in fig .  [ fig : pi](c ) represents the phase shift calculated with these parameters and the effective range expansion for @xmath26 . from these parameters , in turn , the mass of the bound state ( if any ) can be calculated .",
    "with this method , we obtain @xmath27 . a second method of analysis consists in parameterizing the potential in eq .  , and",
    "fit the parameters to reproduce the energy levels .",
    "the energy levels of the best fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi](b ) by the blue dashed line and its associated error band . with this potential ,",
    "then , one can go back to the infinite volume model , and obtain the mass of the bound state , which turns out to be @xmath28 . in ref .",
    "the independence of the method with respect to the regulator chosen is also shown .",
    "a third method is also employed , by parameterizing the amplitude in the infinite volume with an effective range expansion , and then analyzing both levels simultaneously .",
    "it is important to note that the difference with respect to the first method is two - fold : the energy levels , and not the phases , are analyzed , and both levels ( above and below threshold ) instead of only one ( below threshold ) are taken into account . from the effective range parameters",
    "so obtained , one gets @xmath29 .",
    "the second and third methods , as opposed to the first one , yield central values for the mass in better agreement with the one of the infinite volume model , and , furthermore , the errors so determined are smaller .",
    "we conclude that these methods turn out to be more efficient than the first one , and that they can help in analyzing energy levels obtained in real lqcd simulations .",
