    "<S> the kpii equation is an integrable nonlinear pde in 2 + 1 dimensions ( two spatial and one temporal ) , which arises in several physical circumstances , including fluid mechanics where it describes waves in shallow water . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a multidimensional generalisation of the renowned kdv equation . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we employ a novel approach recently introduced by one of the authors in connection with the davey - stewartson equation @xcite , in order to analyse the initial - boundary value problem for the kpii equation formulated on the half - plane . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis makes crucial use of the so - called d - bar formalism , as well as of the so - called global relation . </S>",
    "<S> a novel feature of boundary as opposed to initial - value problems in 2 + 1 is that the d - bar formalism now involves a function in the complex plane which is discontinuous across the real axis . </S>"
