    "however , in practice , the two sources can not synchronize with each other perfectly , and inevitable synchronization errors will occur@xcite .",
    "this causes misaligned reception of the two training sequences at the relay@xcite . clearly , this unpredictable sequence misalignment may destroy the orthogonality of the two sequences and lead to severe estimation errors . in order to alleviate the effects of synchronization errors on channel estimation , the relay strategy and training sequences need to be redesigned .",
    "furthermore , the sequence arriving order ( sao ) ambiguity caused by symbol misalignment is another key issue to be solved in asynchronous transmissions .",

    "<S> this paper investigates pilot - aided channel estimation for two - way relay networks ( twrns ) in the presence of synchronization errors between the two sources . </S>",
    "<S> the unpredictable synchronization error leads to time domain offset and signal arriving order ( sao ) ambiguity when two signals sent from two sources are superimposed at the relay . </S>",
    "<S> a two - step channel estimation algorithm is first proposed , in which the linear minimum mean - square - error ( lmmse ) estimator is used to obtain initial channel estimates based on pilot symbols and a linear minimum error probability ( lmep ) estimator is then developed to update these estimates . </S>",
    "<S> optimal training sequences and power allocation at the relay are designed to further improve the performance for lmmse based initial channel estimation . to tackle the sao ambiguity problem , </S>",
    "<S> the generalized likelihood ratio testing ( glrt ) method is applied and an upper bound on the sao detection error probability is derived . by using the sao information , a scaled lmep estimation algorithm is proposed to compensate the performance degradation caused by sao detection error . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that the proposed estimation algorithms can effectively mitigate the negative effects caused by asynchronous transmissions in twrns , thus significantly outperforming the existing channel estimation algorithms .    </S>",
