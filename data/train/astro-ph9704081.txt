    "whose subtle mind has illuminated many problems in cosmology and general relativity .",
    "i hope that he enjoys the way in which , because of the pervasiveness of neutrinos , cosmology and galactic astronomy become interdependent in the decaying neutrino theory for the ionisation of the interstellar medium ( sciama 1990a , 1993 ) .",
    "i shall give an example of this interdependence here .",
    "my discussion also exemplifies two other useful features of the decaying neutrino theory .",
    "firstly the theory leads to specific and testable predictions concerning the configuration of various matter distributions .",
    "for example , it predicts that , if the ionisation of hydrogen in an opaque region of the galaxy is mainly due to decay photons , then the resulting electron density will be independent of the neutral hydrogen density in the region .",
    "there is observational evidence in support of this prediction ( sciama 1990b , 1997 ) .",
    "the second feature is that various observations have reduced the domain of validity of the theory to a small region of its parameter space .",
    "for example , the energy @xmath5 of a decay photon in the rest frame of the decaying neutrino is constrained with a precision of one per cent ( @xmath6 ) . while this feature may eventually lead to the demise of the theory ,",
    "it has so far managed to survive .    in this paper",
    "i provide another example of these two features , which is based on a new set of comprehensive mass models of the galaxy ( dehnen and binney 1997 ) .",
    "i will demonstrate that , if the decaying neutrino theory is correct , the neutrino halo of our galaxy must be flattened to the maximum extent allowed by these models , that is , with an axial ratio @xmath7 , corresponding to a shape factor e8 ( where q is related to en by @xmath8 .",
    "associated with this result is a constraint imposed on the neutrino decay lifetime @xmath3 , whose value is required to be close to @xmath4 seconds .",
    "the argument leading to these conclusions is based on the following observational results in addition to those underlying the dehnen - binney models :    8.25pt _ ( i ) _ pulsar dispersion data imply that the free election density in the intercloud medium within one kiloparsec of the sun lies in the range @xmath9 ( reynolds 1990 , sciama 1990b ) and these free electrons have a scale height @xmath10 kpc ( reynolds 1991 , nordgren et al 1992 , taylor and cordes 1993 ) .",
    "8.25pt _ ( iii ) _ the isotropic extragalatic photon flux at @xmath14 photons @xmath15 sec@xmath16 ster@xmath17 ( continuum units or cu ) ( henry and murthy 1993 , witt and petersohn 1994 ) .",
    "this value is still somewhat controversial ( compare bowyer 1991 with henry 1991 ) .",
    "in fact a significantly smaller value would rule out the decaying neutrino theory , as we shall see .",
    "the neutrino density @xmath18 near the sun , which we are assuming to be mainly responsible for the free electron density @xmath19 in opaque regions of the intercloud medium , will be given in ionisation equilibrium by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient excluding transitions directly to the ground state .",
    "there is , however , a danger that the decaying neutrino theory may lead to a value for @xmath18 which is larger than is permitted by the dehnen - binney mass models .",
    "we therefore immediately adopt the smallest observationally allowed values for @xmath21 and @xmath19 , namely @xmath22x@xmath23@xmath24sec@xmath16 ( corresponding to the reasonable electron temperature of @xmath25 k ( osterbrock 1989 ) ) and @xmath26 cm @xmath27 respectively . then @xmath28 where @xmath29 secs .",
    "we may convert this number density of neutrinos into a mass density @xmath30 by using the mass derived for a decaying neutrino in the theory , namely @xmath31 ev ( sciama 1993 ) .",
    "we then find that    @xmath32 @xmath33 we now ask what is the largest observationally permitted value for @xmath30 , since we shall soon see that the extragalactic background at @xmath34 leads to a strong lower bound on @xmath35 .",
    "the mass models of dehnen and binney ( 1997 ) provide a detailed answer to this question ( cf .",
    "also gates et al 1995 ) , but a rough estimate can be derived in the following simple manner .",
    "we may obtain observational constraints on @xmath30 in two ways , by considering ( i ) estimates for the total density @xmath36 near the sun ( the oort limit ) and ( ii ) the column densities at the sun for various matter distributions .",
    "the value of the oort limit is controversial ( eg kuijken and gilmore ( 1991 ) , bahcall et al 1992 ) .",
    "recent data from the hubble space telescope have placed strict limits on the contribution to @xmath36 from very faint stars ( eg . gould et al 1996 ) .",
    "a reasonable upper limit on @xmath37 derived from observational estimates of the gravitational force due to @xmath38 pcs of the plane and of the density @xmath39 of observed material , would be @xmath40 m@xmath41 which would lead to an upper limit on @xmath42 . in this connexion",
    "we note that binney et al suggested already in 1987 that all the dark matter near the sun might be due to a flattened halo .",
    "a more stringent upper limit on @xmath37 and therefore on @xmath43 follows from considering various column densities at the sun . according to kuijken and gilmore ( 1991 )",
    "the column density @xmath44 of the observed and dark matter combined out to @xmath45 kpc is @xmath46 m@xmath47 .",
    "some authors have argued that their error estimates should be increased somewhat ( eg . bahcall et al 1994 ) .",
    "we therefore follow gates et al ( 1995 ) and assume that @xmath48 m@xmath49 . for the total column density @xmath50 of the observed material at the sun we adopt @xmath51m@xmath52 ( gould et al 1996 ) .",
    "hence @xmath53m@xmath52 .",
    "so long as the scale height of the neutrino distribution is much greater than @xmath45 kpc , we have that @xmath54 x@xmath55x@xmath56 and so @xmath57 .",
    "in view of the uncertainties in the values we have adopted we shall suppose that @xmath58 .",
    "thus the upper limit on @xmath30 is @xmath59 m@xmath60 .",
    "when we come to consider the background at @xmath61 we shall find that @xmath62 , so that the only consistent possibility is @xmath63 and @xmath64 m@xmath65 .",
    "we therefore examine the implications of this value of @xmath30 for the flattening of the neutrino halo .    since a large @xmath30 implies a flattened neutrino halo , we begin by considering the total column density @xmath66 of a flattened system required to account for the rotation velocity @xmath67 of the galaxy at the sun s position @xmath68 .",
    "binney and tremaine ( 1987 ) give for this quantity @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "hence @xmath72 and so the scale height @xmath73 of the neutrino distribution is given by @xmath74 kpc , which is indeed substantially greater than @xmath45 kpc , so that our previous discussion is valid .",
    "to derive the implied flattening of the neutrino halo we assume that the neutrino distribution in the plane has the form @xmath75 , with @xmath76 ( sciama 1993).then the `` scale - height '' in the plane is @xmath77 or @xmath78 , and so the flattening q is given by @xmath7 , corresponding to the shape @xmath79 .",
    "this simple reasoning is confirmed by the dehnen - binney models which walter dehnen kindly extended for me to include @xmath80 and @xmath7 , for which @xmath81 lies just on the edge of the allowed range of models ( cf .   also gates et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we now show that reynolds ( 1984 ) @xmath83 data , as interpreted by the decaying neutrino theory , also lead to the result @xmath84 .",
    "we consider separately the ionisations produced by decay photons in the opaque layer of free electrons lying above and below the sun out to a distance _",
    "l _ and those produced by decaying neutrinos lying in the transparent regions outside this layer .",
    "a detailed model of the opaque layer would be complicated , because we should consider the contribution of both clouds and the intercloud medium to the opacity .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that the opaque region corresponds to the electron layer of scale height _",
    "l _ as derived from the pulsar dispersion data .",
    "reynolds ( 1991 ) , nordgren et al ( 1992 ) and taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) found that @xmath85 kpc . inside this opaque layer",
    "every decay photon produces an ionisation in its vicinity , so along a line of sight normal to the galactic plane there will be @xmath86 ionisations in this layer , where @xmath87x@xmath23x@xmath88x@xmath89x@xmath90 or @xmath91x@xmath92 .",
    "the column density of neutrinos outside the opaque layer corresponds to @xmath93 and so is @xmath94x@xmath95 neutrinos @xmath15 .",
    "the number of ionisations which they produce inside the layer is reduced by the usual factor @xmath96 which arises from an integration over solid angle related to the slab geometry .",
    "hence they produce @xmath97 ionisations @xmath15sec@xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath98 or @xmath99 given the simplicity of our model for the opaque layer we round this result off to @xmath100 which is just compatible with our previous result @xmath101      some of the earliest lower limits on @xmath82 were based on observational estimates of the cosmic background in the far u - v , due to red - shifted decay photons produced by the cosmological distribution of neutrinos ( stecker 1980 , kimble et al 1981 ) . as mentioned in the introduction we here adopt an observed flux of @xmath102cu at @xmath61 .",
    "the most recent estimate ( armand et al 1994 ) for the contribution due to galaxies at @xmath103 is @xmath104 cu . the red - shifted contribution from decay photons has recently been recalculated by sciama ( 1991 ) , overduin et al ( 1993 ) and dodelson and jubas ( 1994 ) .",
    "the main uncertainty arises from absorption by dust in the galaxy . allowing a factor @xmath105 for this absorption ,",
    "one obtains @xmath106 cu .",
    "given the uncertainties , a reasonable conclusion is that @xmath107 in conjunction with our previous discussion we arrive at a solution which is just consistent with all the observational constraints , with @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 this solution corresponds to the most flattened possible halo for our galaxy ( e8 ) .",
    "we ask in conclusion whether such a large flattening is otherwise reasonable .",
    "i believe that it is .",
    "it is noteworthy that another galaxy , ngc4650a , is observed to have a highly flattened halo .",
    "this was deduced from observations of an outer ring of gas , dust and stars which are on orbits that are nearly perpendicular to the plane of the flattened central galaxy , which rotates about its own apparent minor axis ( a polar ring galaxy ) these orbits delineate the gravitational potential of the galaxy outside its central plane .",
    "sackett et al ( 1994 ) deduced that the halo of this galaxy is flattened towards the plane of its central body .",
    "they state that whenever the data were ambiguous they attempted to err on the side of favouring rounder halos .",
    "still they found for this galaxy that q lies between @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "i therefore regard the requirement from the decaying neutrino theory , that the dark halo of our galaxy is as flat as it could possibly be , is a reasonable one .",
    "i am very grateful to walter dehnen for extending the dehnen - binney mass models of our galaxy into the extreme regime required by the decaying neutrino theory , and for helpful discussions of the limits imposed by these mass models .",
    "i am also grateful to geza gyuk for his advice .",
