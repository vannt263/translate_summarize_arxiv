    "away from sources we write the electromagnetic field @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a complex potential satisfying @xmath6 . the simplest solution is the real one @xmath7 but if we make @xmath8 complex we introduce a magnetic monopole which is unacceptable . moving the charge to @xmath9 we have a potential @xmath10 which corresponds to a charge at @xmath9 when @xmath9 is real , but we now consider @xmath9 to be complex @xmath11 . without loss of generality we may move the origin to @xmath12 and orient the @xmath13 axis along @xmath14 .",
    "if we then set @xmath15 we find @xmath16 @xmath17 has a singular ring at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "to specify @xmath17 properly we need to say which square root is to be taken , but the expansion above for @xmath20 is required to make everything regular at infinity and the simplest cut is across the circle defined by the ring singularity .",
    "with such a cut analytic continuation defines @xmath17 everywhere .",
    "the ` magic ' field is given by @xmath21^{3/2}}\\ ] ] by construction @xmath6 except on the singular ring and the cut , so the sources of the field lie there .",
    "the expansion ( [ 1 ] ) shows that the field has charge @xmath8 , no magnetic monopole but a magnetic dipole @xmath22 .",
    "indeed the electric field has only even multipoles and the magnetic field has only odd ones . on @xmath23",
    "so the denominator of ( [ 2 ] ) is real if @xmath20 and pure imaginary for @xmath24 .",
    "thus close to the plane of symmetry @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "below , where @xmath29 these fields are reversed . notice that @xmath30 is orthogonal to the disk so the disk is an equipotential and",
    "indeed its potential is zero ( earthed ) as may be seen by taking the real part of ( [ 1 ] ) on @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the magnetic field lies parallel to the radius below the disk and anti - parallel above .",
    "it does not cross the disk except at the singular ring . for @xmath33 and @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath34 points downwards everywhere .",
    "thus every field line returns to the upper hemisphere through the singular ring .    from the electric field one readily calculates the surface density of charge on the disk ( summing both sides ) @xmath35 notice that this is of the opposite sign to the total @xmath8 which is rectified only at the singular ring .",
    "indeed the total charge on the cut within @xmath36 is @xmath37 for @xmath38 which diverges with a negative sign as @xmath39 approaches @xmath40 but @xmath41 for @xmath42 so the negative infinity is now replaced by a finite positive result .",
    "likewise the surface current in the cut is @xmath43 which is precisely what we would get if the above charge density were rotating rigidly with angular velocity @xmath44 .",
    "the total current within @xmath38 is @xmath45 .",
    "again the magnetic effects of this current are overwhelmed by the current around the singular ring which is of opposite sign .",
    "notice that the disk is not crossed by a magnetic field line saving at the singular edge ring itself . in this respect",
    "the disk acts like a superconductor displaying the meissner effect . in the black hole context",
    "this phenomenon was noted by bick & janis [ 1 ] ( see also bick & ledvinka [ 2 ] ) .",
    "i now list other properties of this ` magic ' electromagnetic field .",

    "relativistic invariants @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 only on two spheres of radius @xmath48 centred on @xmath49 . they meet on the singular ring .",

    "4 .   the field energy density @xmath51(r^2+a^2)/|({\\bf{r } } -i{\\bf{a}})^2|^3 $ ] .",
    "this diverges like @xmath52 when @xmath31 near @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath53 likewise diverges .",
    "the above is related to the poynting vector which shows that the energy density flows around the axis with a velocity @xmath54 where @xmath55 is constant on spheres @xmath56const with @xmath57 .",
    "landau & lifshitz [ 4 ] show that in the frame that moves with the velocity @xmath58 where @xmath59 , the transformed fields @xmath60 are parallel .",
    "gair proved the theorem that these velocities are a uniform rotation of each spheroid confocal with the disk at the rate @xmath61 ( for @xmath62 see section 2 ) .",
    "8 .   in the corotating frame of those spheroids @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "are both perpendicular to the spheroid on which they lie .",
    "the total field energy and the total angular momentum in the field both diverge due to their divergence at the singular ring .",
    "more remarkable properties still come from the separability of both wave equations and equations of motion of any relativistic charged particle in this field .    1 .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation separates 2 .",
    "the klein gordon equation separates 3 .",
    "the dirac equation separates 4 .",
    "the schrdinger equation separates if only the real part of the field is included ( but not when the magnetic part is added although the reverse is true for the klein gordon equation ) .",
    "all the above really stem from remarkable investigations in the separability of wave equations around black holes by carter [ 5],[6 ] , teukolsky [ 7 ] , chandrasekhar [ 8 ] and page [ 9 ] . in the simpler flat space case",
    "see lynden - bell paper i [ 10 ] .",
    "finally the relationship with black holes and indeed the original discovery of the field in general relativity is due to newman _",
    "[ 11 ] who generalised the kerr metric of a spinning black hole to include charge .",
    "if in his solution one puts newton s @xmath65 one obtains an electromagnetic field in flat space which is the above ` magic ' field [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .",
    "the present investigation is aimed at providing a set of electromagnetic fields in flat space that keep some of the remarkable properties of the magic field but give finite answers for total field energy , total field angular momentum etc .",
    "we aim to find fields which give the magic field as a limiting case but whose other members give finite answers .",
    "some spice is added to the investigation by carter s [ 5 ] remark that all kerr metrics have the same gyromagnetic ratio , 2 , as the dirac electron , and pfister & king [ 15 ] propose that this may have a deeper significance for general relativity .",
    "indeed it holds for * all * the conformastationary metrics , the statement by us [ 16 ] that the gyromagnetic ratio was one , was based on erroneously missing out the factor 2 in its definition .",
    "our disk [ 16 ] remains the only known conformastationary interior solution to einstein s equation .",
    "recently [ 17 ] we discussed the remarkable behaviour of charges on a relativistically rotating conducting sphere .",
    "the changes in the field correspond to addition of more and more of the magic field as the rotation increases .",
    "however even when @xmath2 the distribution on the sphere never becomes the magic field : that discussion leads to the suggestion that the magic field may be the field of the rapidly rotating charged conducting plate with a tip speed of @xmath1 .",
    "the facts that the component of @xmath66 in the plate is zero and that the current is due to the convected charge strongly suggest that this is the limit , as @xmath67 the tip speed tends to @xmath1 , of the charged rotating conducting plate .",
    "this paper is devoted to a discussion of the whole sequence of fields of such a plate when it rotates at any tipspeed up to @xmath1 .",
    "the field lines of the magic field are shown in figure 1 , which was generated by j. gair .",
    "we treat the problem using oblate spheroidal coordinates confocal with the ring that forms the edge of the disk .",
    "actually we shall solve the problem as the limit of a highly flattened spheroid as its minor axis @xmath68 tends to zero ; this allows us to make direct comparisons with our treatment of the rotating charged conducting sphere .",
    "the equation    @xmath69    defines a set of confocal oblate spheroids each with a definite positive value of @xmath70 . when @xmath71 it defines a disk @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath70 is negative it defines a set of hyperboloids of revolution ( of one sheet ) each of which is orthogonal to the oblate spheroids . for @xmath70 positive",
    "we write it as @xmath73 and for @xmath70 negative we write it as @xmath74 or more often as @xmath75 .",
    "the spheroidal coordinates @xmath76 are supplemented by the usual azimuthal angle @xmath77 to give the metric @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the spherical polar coordinate which should be distinguished from the spheroidal coordinate @xmath80 although they are equal at @xmath81 .",
    "we consider the surface of the spheroid @xmath82 to be the rotating conductor .    on @xmath83 , the disk , @xmath84 changes sign which corresponds to the continuity of the normal magnetic flux , and",
    "@xmath85 is continuous which corresponds to the surface component of the electric field being continuous .",
    "the other requirements are that the total charge must be @xmath8 , so @xmath86 at @xmath81 and @xmath87 must have no component along the disk s surface so that the lorentz force component vanishes .",
    "of course the discontinuity of the surface component of @xmath88 corresponds to the surface current @xmath89 and the discontinuity in the normal component of @xmath90 gives the surface density of charge @xmath91 . in the steady state with an imperfect conductor the currents are just those caused by the rotation of the charge .",
    "@xmath92    that completes the physical specification of the problem .",
    "now we turn these physical requirements into mathematics .    on the disk @xmath93 and from the lorentz force component @xmath94",
    "while ( [ 7 ] ) gives @xmath95 hence on the disk @xmath38 , @xmath31 @xmath96    now in spheroidal coordinates the general solution of laplace s equation which tends to @xmath97 at @xmath81 is @xmath98 @xmath99 are the legendre polynomicals and the @xmath100 are the legendre functions here expressed as functions of an imaginary argument .",

    "we consider fields which lie in the meridian planes through an axis of symmetry and which are harmonic above the plane @xmath31 .",
    "for simplicity of exposition we take their potentials to be o@xmath325 at @xmath81 but the method is readily extendable beyond those cases . since the fields are harmonic we may write @xmath326 it is normally not hard to derive an expression for @xmath17 on the axis of symmetry and we shall suppose this has been done so that @xmath214 is known , and @xmath327 as @xmath328 .",
    "we show that the complex scalar and vector potentials @xmath329 and @xmath330 where @xmath331 is the unit toroidal vector are given by @xmath332 @xmath333 provided @xmath214 is analytic in @xmath29 .",
    "proof : @xmath334 where the path in the complex @xmath335 plane is chosen to encircle @xmath336 .",
    "hence @xmath337 and @xmath338 we choose the integration circle to surround the whole circle @xmath339 for all @xmath340 .",
    "we write @xmath341 and reverse the order or integration @xmath342    thus @xmath343 but @xmath344 is zero everywhere except at @xmath345 which is not encountered on the integration path .",
    "hence @xmath346 is harmonic .",
    "but it also reduces to @xmath214 on axis and is @xmath347 at @xmath81 so it gives the complex potential everywhere @xmath348 .    to obtain the vector potential we note that @xmath349 and @xmath350\\nabla\\phi=0\\ ] ] for @xmath27 because there are no sources above @xmath31 .",
    "we now write @xmath351 then the expression in square brackets above reduces to @xmath352 so @xmath353    now we may add an arbitrary function of @xmath13 to @xmath335 without changing @xmath279 so we add @xmath354 and deduce that the new @xmath335 will obey @xmath355 from ( [ a3 ] ) and the above @xmath356 hence @xmath357 .    the linear function of @xmath13 that comes from the integration can again be absorbed into @xmath335 without changing @xmath279 or the fact that @xmath358 .",
    "we now use the theorem proved above for taking @xmath17 off axis , but apply it to @xmath359 .",
    "then @xmath360 differentiating with respect to @xmath39 @xmath361    we notice that both @xmath335 and @xmath279 obey their appropriate equations and that @xmath279 is @xmath347 at @xmath81 as required .",

    "there is the same charge density on the disk as in @xmath17 and it rotates uniformly but less fast .",

    "this is * not * the solution for the non - rotating charged disk but to what physical problem does it correspond ?",
    "i believe it must correspond to the field of an earthed plate surrounded by a charged wire with a small insulating gap , between the wire and the plate . as",
    "the gap becomes smaller , a larger and larger charge must be placed on the wire to ensure that the net charge of wire and plate remains at a fixed value @xmath8 .",
    "i think this non - rotating magic field corresponds to such a singular limit .",
    "perhaps the rotating versions with @xmath365 correspond to the singular solutions of the recurrence relations that we rejected .",
    "these solutions obey the conditions required of a superconducting disk , the charges while rotating uniformly do not correspond to the physical problem that we set out to solve .",
