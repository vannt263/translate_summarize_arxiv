    "thus , a zero - temperature phase transition is expected to occur in a quasi - one - dimensional s=1 antiferromagnet at @xmath21 if the interchain coupling could be varied .",
    "such quantum phase transitions have recently attracted much theoretical attention @xcite .",

    "the application of hydrostatic pressure can change the interatomic separations and local atomic environments to which the spin hamiltonian is highly sensitive , and therefore provides an opportunity for the controlled and continuous tuning of the parameters in the hamiltonian , albeit in a restricted range . here",

    "for the reference measurements at ambient pressure we extracted the microcell with the sample from the pressure cell and placed it in a standard ( ill - type ) flow cryostat .",
    "its transmission for 5 mev neutrons measured the same way as above was 0.60(1 ) , which can be attributed to incoherent scattering from the pressure - transmitting fluid and the nenp sample itself .",
    "the sample was mounted with its ( 0,1,0 ) and ( 1,0,3 ) reciprocal lattice directions in the horizontal scattering plane . with this orientation",
    ", variations of the transverse ( with respect to the spin chains ) components of the wavevector transfer @xmath100 are coupled through @xmath101 . however , the non - zero @xmath102 had negligible effect in our experiment .",
    "first , recalling that inelastic neutron scattering only probes spin fluctuations polarized perpendicular to * q * @xcite , we note that the ( 1,0,0 ) direction was @xmath86 80@xmath103 out of the scattering plane .",
    "this means that at least 97@xmath76 of the spin fluctuations polarized along * a*@xmath73 were always probed .",
    "second , since the dispersion of the excitations along * a*@xmath73 has period 2 in @xmath102 @xcite , it is quite negligible for @xmath104 which is the case in present study .",
    "all constant - q scans were performed at @xmath105 , i.e. with wavevector transfer along the chain @xmath66 .",
    "our experimental results are shown in figs .  [ constqfig][constefig ] .",
    "the scattering intensity is shown normalized to 10 minutes counting time , although due to the low transmission of the pressure cell the bulk of the high - pressure data was counted three times this long to obtain adequate statistics . in fig .",
    "[ constqfig ] we present energy scans at * q*=(5/6,1,5/2 )",
    ". the large component of * q * transverse to the chains means that more than 90@xmath76 of the intensity of the longitudinally polarized ( i.e. parallel to the chain axis ) fluctuations is observed . at ambient pressure ( 0.1mpa )",
    "the corresponding gap is @xmath106= 2.49  mev , in agreement with previous studies @xcite . at @xmath107",
    "gpa this mode shifts to lower energy , and is found at @xmath106 ( 2.5 gpa ) = 2.2  mev .",
    "the numbers quoted here are determined from the fits discussed below .",
    "in contrast , the energy of the transversely polarized mode , which at this * q * primarily contains fluctuations polarized along * a*@xmath73 , increases under pressure from @xmath108 = 1.18  mev to @xmath108(2.5gpa ) = 1.43  mev .",
    "this increase of the energy gap in the magnetic excitations spectrum qualitatively agrees with the results of recent heat capacity measurements @xcite performed at pressures up to @xmath86 0.5  gpa .",
    "figure [ dispfig ] shows scans that probe the dispersion of the transversely polarized modes with wavevector transfer perpendicular to the chains @xmath109 .",
    "presence of cell material in the beam cause much higher inelastic background and elastic scattering intensity in the high - pressure data . for @xmath110 ,",
    "* q * makes angles between 0@xmath103 and @xmath111 with the chain direction , so that between 100% and 70@xmath76 of the intensity of the * a*@xmath73-polarized transverse fluctuations and up to 30@xmath76 of the intensity of the longitudinal fluctuations is measured .",
    "the latter is seen as a small rise after the main peak in the high - pressure data where the corresponding mode is centered at @xmath86 2.2  mev . as shown in fig .",
    "[ c - disp ] , a small shift of @xmath108 to higher energies as @xmath112 changes from 0.5 to 0 is clearly observed at ambient pressure . at p = 2.5  gpa",
    ", however , this shift is much smaller , and barely exceeds the experimental accuracy .",
    "finally , one constant-@xmath82 = 2  mev scan was performed at each pressure to probe the dispersion of the transverse fluctuations with @xmath54 along the chains .",
    "these scans are shown in fig .",
    "[ constefig ] .",
    "the solid curves shown in figs .",
    "[ constqfig][constefig ] were obtained as a result of a global fit to all the data at each pressure using the resolution - convoluted theoretical expression @xcite for the neutron scattering cross - section based on the single - mode approximation ( eq .  ( [ sma ] ) ) for @xmath113 . to account for the dispersion perpendicular to the chains we used the dispersion relation    @xmath114    with @xmath115 .",
    "this was derived by adding in quadrature the energy of the haldane modes given by eq .",
    "( [ hw1 ] ) with the transverse dispersion obtained for magnons in spin - wave theory .",
    "we note that for @xmath54 close to @xmath55 , eq .  ( [ hw2 ] ) was obtained by affleck @xcite by treating the array of weakly interacting haldane chains on the basis of the nonlinear sigma model . except for the common parameters @xmath106 , @xmath108 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ hw2 ] ) , for each scan only the individual constant background and gaussian intensity and width of the diffuse tail of incoherent scattering were varied in the global fit . due to",
    "the limited range of @xmath54 probed , the parameter a was fixed at the value 34 mev@xmath64 determined previously @xcite .",
    "the results of the fits for the parameters in the dispersion relation are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the values @xmath118=3.27 and @xmath118(2.5gpa)=0.95 once more indicate the validity of the single mode approximation ( [ sma ] ) .    it can easily be shown within the framework of perturbation theory @xcite that the single - ion anisotropy term @xmath119 gives a splitting of the initially isotropic haldane triplet such that the average gap value remains unchanged : @xmath120 .",
    "this fact can also be established with the symmetry arguments presented in the numerical study by meshkov@xcite , where to @xmath121 accuracy the splitting was found to obey    @xmath122    so that @xmath123 . while we found that the average gap value @xmath124 essentially did not change under pressure , the splitting of the gap decreased by more than 50@xmath76 .",
    "this implies that only @xmath19 is affected by hydrostatic pressure , while @xmath12 remains unchanged . using eq .",
    "( [ splitting ] ) we arrive at the value @xmath19(2.5  gpa ) = 0.09(7)@xmath12 for the anisotropy constant as compared to 0.16(2)@xmath12 under normal conditions .",
    "this result can be given a simple interpretation : since the hydrostatic pressure is isotropic , it tends to pack charge distributions inside the crystal more symmetrically , thereby reducing the local anisotropy . from the transverse dispersion parameter @xmath125",
    ", we estimate the exchange along the * c*@xmath73 direction to be @xmath126 and @xmath127(2.5gpa)@xmath128 .",
    "this is even smaller than the value @xmath129 in the * a*@xmath73 direction measured previously @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath127 appears to decrease with pressure , but this change is at the limit of our experimental accuracy .",
    "in conclusion , changes in the spin dynamics of the haldane gap antiferromagnet ni(c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath0)@xmath0no@xmath0clo@xmath2 ( nenp ) under applied hydrostatic pressure of 2.5  gpa were studied by inelastic neutron scattering , and another point in the ( d / j , j@xmath130/j ) phase diagram of the s=1 spin system in the haldane state has been attained experimentally .",
    "the principal effect of pressure was found to be a decrease by a factor 1.7 of the single - ion anisotropy constant in the spin hamiltonian of the ni@xmath39 magnetic ions .",
    "this finding explains the increase with pressure of the effective spin gap in nenp observed in the recent heat capacity measurements @xcite , as being the result of the increasing energy of the lower doublet component of the haldane triplet .",
    "the exchange constant in the @xmath8-direction perpendicular to the chains was also measured for the first time .",
    "it is smaller than the exchange along @xmath50 , and seems to decrease slightly with pressure .",
    "thus the overall effect of applying hydrostatic pressure in nenp is not to move the system towards the phase transition to the nel ordered ground state or the large-@xmath19 planar phase but to bring it closer to the isotropic 1d limit .",
