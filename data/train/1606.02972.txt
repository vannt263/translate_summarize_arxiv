    "the number of ground states is proportional to @xmath134 , with @xmath116 the number of lines .        if we choose a field with strength slightly larger than @xmath135 , by the same mechanism explained in the main text , two ground states with staggered order between the horizontal lines ( see fig .",

    "this feature produces an effective antiferromagnetic interaction between the horizontal spins that orders the system as soon as these excitation are activated by temperature .",
    "an effective one dimensional model can be derived for this problem following the same steps presented in the main text .",
    "strong finite size effects are also present in this case and we propose to use them as a signature for obd by analysing experimental data at low , but not so low , temperatures for moderate system sizes .",
    "note that this scenario is not destroyed by a slight misalignment of the field . however , the dipolar interactions could lift the degeneracy between the ground states .",
    "care must then be taken to make the dipolar interactions as weak as possible ."

    "<S> neutron scattering could be a sensitive probe if only short or medium range af order is set due to competing ordering trends . </S>",
    "<S> a second route towards obd is to take advantage of the recent advances in the design of frustrated magnets to create a planar system similar to the one in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the idea is to use artificial square - lattice spin - ice samples in their af phase , with the vertex energy hierarchy @xmath103 where @xmath104 indicates af , @xmath105 three - in / one - out or three - out / one - in and @xmath106 fm vertices  @xcite ( see the supplemental material for a detailed explanation  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the third route concerns the use of colloidal systems in @xmath0 arrays of optical traps , where staggered charge order could be attainable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the precise control over the interactions and accessibility of thermal excitations may offer another fertile ground to recreate this experiment . </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen , fse have a very strong influence in @xmath25 ; this fact may be exploited to recognise incipient obd using samples with small size .    in summary , we have made an in - depth numerical and theoretical study of obd in two models closely linked to ice systems . </S>",
