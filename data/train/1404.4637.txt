    "strontium ruthenate , sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , is an unconventional superconductor ( @xmath3)@xcite for which there exists substantial evidence for odd - parity pairing@xcite as well as for the spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry below @xmath4@xcite .",
    "these observations lead naturally to the conclusion that the pairing symmetry is chiral @xmath0-wave ( @xmath5 ) , a two dimensional analog of the a - phase of superfluid @xmath6he .",
    "though this is the leading phenomenological hypothesis , it is seemingly contradicted by several experiments .",
    "prominent among these are high resolution scanning magnetometry measurements@xcite , which image magnetic fields across several @xmath7 of sample ( including the sample edge ) and see no sign of the expected spontaneous currents .    the presence of spontaneous , persistent charge currents at edges and domain walls is a robust consequence of time - reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity .",
    "however , the magnitude of these currents is determined by microscopic details  they are neither quantized nor universal .",
    "the reason that the null result of the scanning magnetometry experiments poses such a challenge to the chiral @xmath0-wave hypothesis is quantitative  spontaneous currents of size comparable to theoretical estimates@xcite would give a magnetic signal more than two orders of magnitude greater than the experimental resolution .",
    "magnetometry measurements on mesoscopic samples@xcite also see no signs of these currents .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the spontaneous surface currents for a family of models consistent with the phenomenology of superconductivity in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "motivated by @xmath8-axis tunneling experiments@xcite , we employ a different interface condition than previous studies , modeling the surface region as a normal metal layer adjoining the superconducting bulk .",
    "we find that , compared to previous estimates , the expected magnetic signal from edge currents is reduced by over an order of magnitude .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that interface details can have a quantitatively meaningful effect on the expectations for magnetometry experiments .",
    "the assumption of specular surface scattering as employed in@xcite requires an atomically smooth surface . @xmath9 faces of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 can be cleaved , but @xmath10 and @xmath11 faces are typically polished to a smoothness of several @xmath12@xcite , on the order of ten lattice constants . in @xmath8-axis junction tunneling conductance measurements , signatures of superconductivity at the surface",
    "are present only at the sub-@xmath13 level on top of a substantial smooth background@xcite , as shown in fig . 2 of that reference .",
    "accordingly , the best indication from experiment is that the edge region is metallic@xcite , with a superconducting gap developing only further into the sample .",
    "such a scenario is plausible given the fragility of unconventional superconductivity to elastic scattering ( i.e. the inapplicability of anderson s theorem to a sign - changing order parameter ) , which has been explicitly verified for this material@xcite . rough or pair - breaking surface effects have been shown@xcite to sharply reduce the superconducting order parameter at the surface , although not to meaningfully alter the surface density of states .",
    "accordingly , the observation of metallic behavior suggests that there is a higher density of defects near the surface ( presumably introduced during crystal growth or preparation procedures ) , leading to a reduced mean free path and the quenching of superconductivity near the surface .    to facilitate calculations ,",
    "we do not directly treat a rough surface or defects in the surface region , but rather adopt a model consisting of a clean interface between vacuum and a metallic region , which in turn has a clean interface with the superconducting bulk .",
    "the metallic region is arranged by setting appropriate coupling constants to zero in lattice bogoliubov de - gennes hamiltonians .",
    "this introduces artifacts which will be discussed in section vii .",
    "we consider spinless fermions on a 2d square lattice corresponding to the ruo@xmath1 plane , and work in a cylinder geometry : periodic boundary conditions are taken in the @xmath14 direction , and open boundary conditions in @xmath15 .",

    "we neglect the effect of screening , whose effects have been explored elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "the conditions for a metallic boundary involve phenomenological parameters @xmath62 which capture the fact that a metal interface is partially pair - breaking for both components @xcite .",
    "we continue to ignore screening , and focus on the spontaneous current ( i.e. the current which exists in the absence of phase gradients imposed by an external field ) : @xmath63^*+\\psi_x[\\partial_x\\psi_y]^*-c.c.\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\propto k_3\\left(|\\psi_y|\\partial_x |\\psi_x|- |\\psi_x|\\partial_x |\\psi_y|\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these expressions we have implemented translation symmetry in the @xmath14 direction and assumed a uniform relative phase factor of @xmath48 between @xmath60 and @xmath64 ( i.e. positive chirality ) . here",

    "[ fig : cont ]    as previously mentioned , our estimate for the edge current in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is the sum of contributions due to the quasi-2d @xmath19 band and the quasi-1d @xmath69 bands ; we initially plot and discuss these contributions separately .",
    "values of net current are given in units of @xmath70 , which is the net current due to the @xmath19 band with an insulating interface ( @xmath71 ) at @xmath72 , in the weak coupling limit @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is approximately equal to the value of the total current per spin in a quasi - classical approximation ( such as the matsumoto - sigrist prediction@xcite used in @xcite ) when screening is neglected .",
    "if our model predicts a current @xmath54 and screening alters our predictions in the same way as it does the quasi - classical results of matsumoto - sigrist , then our prediction of a magnetic signal ( such as the peak flux ) is equal to the matsumoto - sigrist prediction times @xmath75 .",
    "plots of the current and both components of the order parameter as a function of distance from the edge are shown in figures 1 .",
    "figures 2 show the two current contributions versus temperature for several choices of @xmath44 .",
    "data points near @xmath4 are not included due to computational cost .",
    "figures 3 show the current contributions as a function of the bulk order parameter ( @xmath47 and @xmath46 respectively , with fixed values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . before considering the effect of the normal - metal region , we note basic results for a clean insulator ( or vacuum ) / superconductor ( is ) interface ( @xmath71 ) . in that case ,",
    "compared to the contribution from @xmath18 , the net current from @xmath26 is reduced by a factor of approximately three at zero temperature and six at the experimental temperature of @xmath78 .    turning to the results for a normal metal / superconductor ( ns ) interface ( i.e. @xmath79 ) ,",
    "one feature of the @xmath80 curves for different values of @xmath44 is that they all coincide at zero temperature and at sufficiently high temperature , differing only in an intermediate crossover region .",
    "this follows from the proximity effect : while the superconducting gap @xmath81 is zero in the metal ( where @xmath82 ) , pair correlations @xmath83 do penetrate .",
    "the length scale for this penetration is set by @xmath84 , ( where @xmath85 is the fermi velocity ) , and thus diverges at zero temperature , so that the width of the metallic region is effectively zero . by contrast , at temperatures such that @xmath86 , pairing correlations decay to zero before the edge is encountered , so that the metallic region is effectively infinite . in both cases ,",
    "an increase in @xmath44 should have a negligible effect on the currents , consistent with the calculation .    for @xmath86",
    "there is a pronounced suppression of the current in both the one and quasi-1d cases compared with the current without a metallic region ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the amount of this suppression depends on the size of the pairing gap . for sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 ,",
    "the pairing gap is on the order of @xmath87 , so that extrapolation to the weak coupling limit @xmath88 is necessary for a quantitative estimate . for a model including all three bands in this weak coupling limit",
    ", we find a suppression of approximately twenty compared to the initial matsumoto - sigrist predictions .",
    "the results of the previous section can be summarized as follows : 1 ) the contribution from the @xmath89 bands is a several times smaller than that of the @xmath19 band for the is geometry .",
    "2 ) both contributions are substantially suppressed in the ns geometry .",
    "3 ) the suppression due to the ns geometry is considerably larger for the @xmath19 band than for the @xmath89 bands .",
    "ginzburg - landau theory , though it is not quantitatively valid at low temperatures , can nonetheless qualitatively explain each of these results .",
    "\\1 ) with a conventional insulating interface , the scale of spontaneous currents is set by the coefficient @xmath67 . in the quasi-2d model ,",
    "this is a number of order one , whereas in the quasi-1d model , it vanishes in the limit of zero inter - orbital mixing @xmath34 . since @xmath90 , it follows that @xmath91 is substantially smaller than @xmath92 and similarly for the currents .",
    "a microscopic calculation gives @xmath93 .",
    "\\2 ) the suppression in current in the ns geometry can be viewed as a consequence of the different boundary conditions on the order parameter .",
    "the boundary values of of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are respectively increased and decreased compared to the insulating case . at a fixed distance from the edge @xmath94 and @xmath96 are larger while @xmath95 and @xmath97 are smaller than their corresponding values for the insulating boundary .",
    "for the current shows that this yields a numerical ( though not parametric ) reduction in the current for any choice of g - l coefficients .",
    "\\3 ) the tremendous suppression of the current in the quasi-2d ns model is a lattice effect . for the fine - tuned case @xmath98",
    ", one can show that @xmath99 and the two components of the order parameter heal away from the metal in precisely the same way , leading to a vanishing current in lowest - order g - l theory@xcite . for a quadratic dispersion and an order parameter @xmath100 , as is often used to describe the @xmath19 band@xcite , the coefficients satisfy @xmath101 .",
    "however , for a lattice - compatible order parameter @xmath102 as treated here and for an appropriate tight - binding band structure for the @xmath19 band , @xmath103 . the large suppression of the @xmath19 band current due to the ns geometry can be roughly identified with the proximity of this result to the fine - tuned case @xmath98 .",
    "superconductivity on the quasi-1d bands was previously conjectured@xcite to lead to dramatically reduced edge currents compared to a quasi-2d scenario due to trivial topology ( i.e. the chern numbers of the two bands add to zero , yielding no net chiral edge modes ) .",
    "the results shown above for the is interface show a substantial reduction ( by a factor between three and six ) , but nonetheless of order one , falsifying the initial conjecture and illustrating the tenuous connection between topology and edge currents in chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors ( this topic will be treated in depth in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "even if the quasi-1d bands had vastly reduced currents in the is case , the contribution from the @xmath19 band would generically be large , even if it were not the `` dominant '' band .",
    "the neglect of the current contribution from the subdominant band(s ) is only justified if the experimental temperature exceeds the subdominant gap scale .",
    "however , thermodynamic evidence shows that the gaps on all bands are at least comparable to @xmath104@xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "the edge currents should then correspond to the sum of contributions from the quasi-1d and quasi-2d bands , with the weak coupling limit taken for both @xmath46 and @xmath47 . at low temperatures and with a clean interface , the generic scale of edge currents",
    "is `` of order one '' regardless of microscopic mechanism details such as the identity of the dominant band(s ) .",
    "though there does not seem to be any physical reason for a parametric suppression of edge currents , we find a meaningful quantitative reduction of over an order of magnitude compared to previous estimates by considering the effect of surface imperfection . within a model of a clean metal of width @xmath105 abutting a clean superconductor , with @xmath72 , the total current from all three bands is suppressed by a factor of more than twenty in the weak coupling limit compared to the result for the @xmath19 band and an is interface . within our model",
    ", there is essentially no suppression in the limit of sufficiently low temperatures and/or narrow metallic regions , where superconducting correlations induced by the proximity effect extend all the way to the edge .",
    "this is an artifact of our model , however , which does not treat surface roughness or disorder directly . for example , pair - breaking and diffuse scattering effects are known to reduce the zero - temperature current @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here are not expected to be quantitatively correct for the actual superconducting gap structure and surface physics of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "our model of spinless fermions entirely neglects spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which has been proposed to qualitatively affect pairing@xcite .",
    "however , as far as the edge current is concerned , the primary effect of soc is to modestly renormalize the band structure ; hence , its explicit inclusion would not change any of our results substantially .",
    "a more serious unphysical assumption is the neglect of the inter - band proximity effect , without which superconductivity would generically arise at very different temperatures on the @xmath19 and @xmath106 bands . while inter - band proximity coupling would not change the additivity of the current contributions from the different bands , it would alter the length scale over which the various order parameter components heal away from an interface .",
    "the resulting currents could be reduced or increased compared to our results , depending on microscopic details .    these defects notwithstanding ,",
    "the model treated above illustrates that substantial reductions in magnetic signal can arise from interface effects .",
    "we now consider the consequences of a twenty - fold reduction for the interpretation of magnetometry experiments . even with this reduction the magnetic signal at the edge",
    "would still be estimated to be several times the resolution of scanning magnetometry experiments , and should therefore be observable . however , if multiple domains of sufficiently small size are present in the sample and intersect the edge , the magnetic fields from spontaneous currents would be unobservable .",
    "kirtley et al@xcite find that , to be consistent with the matsumoto - sigrist predictions@xcite , @xmath9-plane domains below about @xmath107 in size are necessary . to be consistent with a prediction twenty times smaller",
    ", the domains could be as large as perhaps @xmath108 .",
    "however , the presence of multiple @xmath9-plane domains within the sample would lead to spontaneous currents at the domain walls , which have not been treated here .",
    "unless domain walls are pinned by crystal defects that , like a rough edge , lead to quenched superconductivity ( an unlikely proposition ) , the suppression indicated in the foregoing calculations would not apply to the domain wall currents .",
    "one scenario for the lack of an edge signal which would not imply a signal at interior domain boundaries is the c - axis stacking of planar domains of macroscopic horizontal extent and alternating chirality .",
    "the energetic cost of the domain boundaries would be small , due to the very weak dispersion of the electronic band structure along the c direction , and symmetry requires that no spontaneous current would flow at these boundaries .",
    "the measurements of hicks et al @xcite place an upper bound of @xmath109 on the height of such domains ( depending on microscopic domain details , and again assuming matsumoto - sigrist predictions for edge currents@xcite ) . here , a twenty - fold reduction of expected edge currents for a single domain would revise upward the experimental bound on domain size , possibly reconciling the null result of scanning magnetometry experiments with the spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking seen in kerr effect measurements with mesoscopic spot size ( @xmath110 ) and skin depth ( @xmath111@xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that spontaneous currents in a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor are highly sensitive to interface details , in particular that surface disorder leading to a @xmath112-thickness metallic surface region can cause a suppression of more than an order of magnitude compared to naive estimates .",
    "we propose that a scenario of c - axis domain stacking , along with surface disorder , might resolve the seeming disagreement between scanning magnetometry and kerr probes , and further suggest that the edge of a crystal fractured in vacuum might host a much lower defect density , and potentially lead to observable edge currents .    *",
