    "( 2011 ) , a source size of 22  was assumed for the cvc and broad emitting regions ( this constraint is revisited in  5 ) , with areal filling factors @xmath77 , which allows the sources to take on any sizes up to 22  to find the model parameters that best represent the data",
    ". a co - to - h@xmath31 abundance ratio of @xmath78 was assumed to scale the co column density to a total molecular gas column density ( lacy et al .",
    "1994 ; the derived molecular gas masses scale inversely with the assumed value ) .",
    "co - to - h@xmath31 abundance ratios of @xmath79 to @xmath78 are assumed in the literature .",
    "we have chosen the high end of this range , which is as large as the co abundance can get for gas - phase abundances similar to the solar neighborhood ( most of the gas - phase carbon would be in the form of co ) , because it makes our mass estimates conservative in the sense of producing minimal molecular gas masses .",
    "we did two types of radex model fitting to the co spectral line energy distributions : ( 1 ) using only the lines up to and including @xmath80 , in which the cvc and broad components could be distinguished with the spectral resolutions afforded by hifi and ground - based heterodyne observations , and ( 2 ) using the cvc model level populations to generate line fluxes for the @xmath81 and higher lines for subtraction from the fts fluxes to estimate and model the broad component fluxes .",
    "case ( 2 ) is included because additional line flux information is available in the fts spectra : the cvc and broad components must sum to match the fts line fluxes ( within the photometric uncertainties ) .",
    "the cvc line fluxes , rather than the broad component fluxes , were subtracted because they were better constrained for more of the low and mid-@xmath1 lines . to properly treat the uncertainties , the likelihood distributions for the @xmath81 and higher lines from the cvc model",
    "were used for subtraction from the fts line fluxes , thereby marginalizing over the ranges of allowed values .",
    "we explore case ( 2 ) in the discussion (  5 ) because it makes use of all available information and assumes there are no non - physical discontinuities in the spectral line energy distributions of the different components . within the two broad categories of models",

    "[ fig5 ] and table 6 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , given what has been observed for other galaxies , two temperature components are required to simultaneously account for the lowest@xmath40 lines ( @xmath83 and @xmath44 ) and the mid@xmath40 lines line fluxes and a higher - excitation component is required to explain the mid@xmath40 lines  a single component can not simultaneously do both . ] .",
    "the cold component is quite cold , @xmath84 k ( error bars are @xmath85 unless otherwise indicated , where @xmath85 encompasses 68% of the likelihood distributions about the means ) , and the warm component is @xmath86 k. the densities of the two components are not well constrained , both with appreciable likelihood from @xmath87 to @xmath88 @xmath89 . because the density likelihoods are so broad , the pressures ( the products of the temperatures and densities ) are poorly constrained . for the cold component",
    "the pressure likelihood is appreciable from @xmath90 to @xmath91 k @xmath89 .",
    "the pressure of the warm component has a median of @xmath92 k @xmath89 and a @xmath85 range of approximately one dex .",
    "the luminosities , which are largely independent of the model parameters , are well separated and well constrained , with the cool component ( log @xmath93 ) required to explain the luminosities of the lowest few lines and the warm ( log @xmath94 ) component almost entirely responsible for the luminosities of the lines above @xmath2 .",
    "only about 3% of the luminosity emerges in the low@xmath40 lines , which is on the low end of the range observed in k14 , but not extraordinary . as with density and temperature , column density and beam filling factor are degenerate and anticorrelated in fits",
    "; thus , we focus on their product , the beam - averaged column density , which is converted to molecular gas mass as in k14 .",
    "the cold and warm component masses are log @xmath95 and log @xmath96 , yielding a cold - to - warm component mass ratio of 0.1 , similar to the average of the k14 sample ( @xmath97 ) .    with optically thick dust at far - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath98 ) , the high@xmath40 co lines are likely subject to extinction . under the assumption of well - mixed molecular gas and dust ,",
    "the extinction correction can be applied by dividing the line fluxes by a factor @xmath99 .",
    "the correction has the effect of slightly enhancing the bump in the spectral line energy distribution starting at @xmath34 and extending to @xmath3 .",
    "predictably , the luminosity of the warm component rises slightly , from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , and the cold component luminosity is virtually unchanged ( where the luminosities include the lines from @xmath50 to @xmath39 ) .",
    "conversely , the pressure in the warm component drops by about a factor of five and is more tightly constrained , indicating that with the extinction correction the gas is better represented by a single temperature component .",
    "similarly , the cold component pressure also drops and is likewise more tightly constrained .",
    "the masses of the two components do not change significantly .",
    "thus , the overall effect of the extinction correction is to raise the co ( warm component ) luminosity by approximately 23% , restrict the pressure likelihoods to smaller ranges ( despite the additional uncertainties introduced by the uncertainties in the dust optical depths at the line frequencies ) , and leave the masses unchanged . for most of the remainder of the analysis",
    ", we consider the non - extinction corrected results because the properties of dust in the outflow are unknown and may not be similar to the general dense interstellar medium ; however , we do describe the implications of making the extinction correction where they are relevant .",
    "carma co @xmath102 interferometry resolves the cvc into compact emission ( `` nucleus '' ) , with a deconvolved radius of 60 pc , and an extended region ( `` envelope '' ) at least twice that size ( alatalo et al 2011 ) .",
    "we are unable to obtain fits of the cvc spectral line energy distribution that are consistent with the @xmath50 , @xmath44 , and @xmath103 lines if we restrict the emitting region to a radius of 60 pc : the line fluxes are underproduced by the models and a substantially larger radius must be allowed , confirming the presence of the envelope . to attempt to quantify the fraction of low@xmath40 emission arising in the nucleus and envelope , we ran models with the same percentages of @xmath50 , @xmath44 , and @xmath103 lines subtracted from the cvc fluxes and a compact source radius fixed at 60 pc , such that the fractions of the line fluxes subtracted represent the flux arising from the envelope .",
    "the model fits are not unique , but we conclude that likely at least 50% of the cvc flux from the @xmath102 and @xmath46 lines arises from the envelope . could substantially affect this comparison because alatalo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measured very similar @xmath50 line fluxes with carma and the iram 30 m. ]    only a single gas component is required to fit the broad component spectral line energy distribution up to and including the @xmath3 line ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and table [ broad_all ] ) : while the temperature is low ( median value of 34 k ) and well constrained ( @xmath51 range of 30 k to 41 ) , the density likelihood distribution is very broad ( partially because of the large uncertainties in the mid@xmath40 broad component line fluxes ) , ranging from @xmath104 to just over @xmath88 @xmath89 , leading to a broad pressure likelihood distribution ( @xmath105 k @xmath89 to @xmath106 k @xmath89 ) . in fact , the density and pressure have uniform likelihood to the high ( unphysical ) end of the model grid , indicating unconstrained upper limits .",
    "hence , while it seems likely that the gas is cold , its pressure and excitation are uncertain owing to the large allowed range in density .",
    "the mass of the broad component is well constrained with @xmath107 , intermediate between the cold and warm cvc masses .",
    "thus , the mass and luminosity ( @xmath108 ) of the broad component are well constrained , but the gas pressure is not . as described next ,",
    "using the full span of lines , including the higher@xmath40 , lines indicates both cold and warm components , with the cold component parameters being very similar to those derived using only the low and mid@xmath40 lines .    in case",

    "[ fig8 ] . with two components and the mass constraint ,",
    "the luminosities of the cold and warm components are @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and the temperatures are well separated , with maximum likelihood values of @xmath112 k and @xmath113 150 k , and masses of approximately log @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "thus , the cold component dominates the mass and the warm component dominates the luminosity .",
    "the warm h@xmath31 density distribution is bimodal , with appreciable likelihood in the @xmath116 @xmath89 range and above @xmath117 @xmath89 , but low likelihood between those ranges .",
    "the high range runs to the grid limit , but we disregard these densities ( @xmath118 @xmath89 ) because they are unphysically high . the high pressure ( @xmath119 k @xmath89 )",
    "are also unphysical because they correspond to the unphysical densities .",
    "while the extrapolation of the cvc to high - j introduces substantial uncertainty , the broad component solutions are qualitatively similar to what has been observed for most other galaxies that have been studied in similar detail : two temperature components are required , the warm component is responsible for the bulk of the co luminosity , and most of the mass is in the cold component .",
    "we reiterate that the warm broad component parameters are meaningful only if our extrapolation of the separation into broad and cvc components to the @xmath120 and higher lines , based on the case ( 1 ) model , is valid .",
    "however , the temperature of the cooler component , @xmath113 60 k , is consistent with the analysis of the @xmath121 and below lines only .",
    "applying the extinction correction drives up the @xmath122 and higher line fluxes and hence the warm broad component luminosity to @xmath123 , an increase of approximately 2 ( where the luminosity now includes all of the lines from @xmath50 to @xmath33 ) .",
    "our rotational co molecular gas mass measurements can be compared to mass measurements from h@xmath31 observations .",
    "roussel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used vibrational transitions of h@xmath31 to measure the molecular gas mass in the nuclear region of ngc1266 with an irregular 287 square arcsecond aperture .",
    "they measured gas masses of @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the temperature ranges @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "they did not have sufficient velocity resolution to separate the cvc and broad components , both of which presumably contribute to their line fluxes .",
    "using vibrational h@xmath31 , they did not probe the gas in our cool component ( probed with rotational transitions of co ) . their @xmath126 component overlaps substantially with our warm broad component ( @xmath128 k ) and somewhat with our warm cvc component ( @xmath129 k , where the error bars are @xmath51 ) , which yield a combined mass of @xmath130 , approximately @xmath131 the h@xmath31 mass .",
    "these mass estimates compare favorably considering that much of our cvc warm component could be cooler than 200 k. ( the @xmath132 k h@xmath31 component mass of @xmath125 may also overlap with our broad component , which has non - zero temperature likelihood up to @xmath133 k. ) thus , the h@xmath31 and co - derived masses provide consistency checks , which the temperature estimates pass , but do not provide direct comparisons .",
    "ngc 1266 is notably complex for an s@xmath0 galaxy : there are at least five discernible components of co emission from the nuclear region : ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) the cvc , presumably a disk , comprised of cool and warm components and with mass dominated by the cool component , but in which the warm component dominates the luminosity ; ( 3 ) an extended , cool cvc envelope of radius @xmath134 pc ; and ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) the cool ( more massive ) and warm ( more luminous ) broad components associated with the outflow .",

    "our modeling indicates cool and warm molecular gas masses for the cvc  including the envelope  of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , so the cvc mass is dominated by the cold ( @xmath137 k ) component . for comparison , alatalo et al .",

    "they use two additional methods to determine the cvc mass .",

    "their combined nucleus and envelope mass of @xmath148 , is just outside the @xmath51 upper bound of our model ; hence it can not be considered inconsistent with our results .",
    "in fact , given the uncertainties , these values are all remarkably consistent .",
    "our new observations and modeling have added to our understanding by showing that 10% of the cvc mass is in a warm , high pressure component ( @xmath149 k @xmath89 with a @xmath85 range of approximately one dex ) .",
    "estimation of the mass and physical conditions of the broad component , the molecular outflow from the nucleus of ngc 1266 , is important because it will yield insight into the acceleration of the outflow and because the gas could enrich the halo of ngc 1266 . to summarize the physical conditions we derived for the broad component : the low and mid@xmath40 spectral line energy distribution is well fit by a single component ( @xmath150 k , @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) .",

    "this also raises their outflow mass estimate to 110 @xmath168 yr@xmath25 .",
    "however , we are skeptical of this conclusion . even if the broad line emission is both optically thick and arises in dense gas ,",
    "that does not imply that the ulirg conversion factor is appropriate for determining the gas mass from the co line flux . also , their revised outflow mass is comparable to our estimate for that of the cvc component , which would mean that the latter does not dominate the gas mass .",
    "the dust mass ( table 5 ) also provides an estimate of the total mass of the molecular gas . assuming a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 ( k14 argue it could be up to a factor of two smaller ) , our dust mass converts to a gas mass of @xmath169 .",
    "combined , the ensemble of measurements favors a total gas mass nearer to @xmath91 than @xmath170 .",
    "we note that the primary uncertainty in our molecular gas estimates is the relative abundance of co to h@xmath31 , which likely contributes an uncertainty of approximately a factor of two to our molecular gas masses in addition to the statistical uncertainties in the tables and figures , and that the molecular gas masses may be biased low if anything because of our relative abundance choice ( @xmath171 ) , but we are not subject to uncertainties in the co x@xmath172 factor or lack of knowledge of the co rotational level excitation .",

    "if the far - infrared luminosity of ngc 1266 is due entirely to star formation its star formation rate is approximately 6 @xmath173 yr@xmath25 .",

    "in contrast , mrk 231 , a seyfert 1 galaxy , has a co spectral line energy distribution ( characteristic of agn dominated galaxies ) that remains flat above @xmath181 for several lines before declining more slowly than starburst galaxies . ngc 1266 s co spectral line energy distribution is intermediate , suggesting perhaps that either both star formation and the agn contribute to the co excitation , or that the agn is simply too weak to dominate the excitation of the high@xmath40 lines .    using the additional hifi observations reported here , we are able to separate the co luminosity of the broad component from that of the cvc . for the cvc ,",
    "the derived @xmath183 is indistinguishable from the mean value in the k14 sample .",
    "this implies that this ratio must be substantially larger for the outflow , and possibly very large if the far - infrared emission is dominated by the cvc .",
    "this has important implications for the energetics of the outflow , as we discuss below .",
    "there are multiple mechanisms that could contribute to the heating and excitation of the warm , broad ( outflow ) component of the gas : photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) associated with high - mass star formation regions ; shocks from outflows , infall , or other gas dynamics ; cosmic rays ; and an x - ray dissociation region ( xdr ) produced by the agn .",

    "( 2013 ) reached similar conclusions about ngc 6240 from their analysis of the _ herschel _ spire fts co spectral line energy distribution .    here",
    "we revisit the possibility of pdrs as an important agent in the heating of the warm molecular gas , using the additional information obtained by resolving the cvc and broad components in the @xmath102 to @xmath3 lines with ground - based and hifi observations .",
    "specifically , we consider the @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 ratios , combined with the number density constraints from our non - lte modeling .",
    "the pdr models are those of wolfire et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( m.  wolfire , private communication 2011 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "consider first the @xmath194 ratio ( figure [ fig10 ] upper left ) .",
    "the green and blue curves show the observed values for the cvc and broad components , respectively , while the dashed vertical lines show the allowed density regimes , similarly color - coded .",
    "the cvc and broad line - to - continuum ratios are nearly identical , reflecting the similarity of the fluxes in the two components .",
    "for both the warm cvc and broad components , we find that pdr solutions _ are _",
    "acceptable for @xmath195 between @xmath90 and @xmath104 .",
    "however , there is an important caveat to this conclusion . in the absence of high - resolution spectral and continuum imaging ,",
    "it is not known what fraction of the far - infrared luminosity should be assigned to each component .",
    "the observed ratios have therefore been calculated by assigning 100% of the far - infrared flux to both .",
    "it is highly likely that this results in a significant underestimate of the true line - to - continuum ratio for the broad component . as discussed above , the total @xmath196 ratio for the cvc component",
    "is typical for star - forming galaxies ( k14 ) when all of the far - infrared luminosity is assigned to this component , while for the broad component this ratio is unusually high .",
    "combined with the other evidence for star formation in this galaxy ( alatalo et al .",
    "2011 ; alatalo et al .",
    "2014 ) , this suggests that a large fraction of the far - ir arises from the cvc component . if only a fraction @xmath197 should be associated with the broad component emission , then the acceptable log @xmath195 range in figure [ fig10]a will shift down by approximately @xmath198 ( for @xmath199 ) , implying that @xmath200 for @xmath201 .",
    "this has important implications when we consider the other pdr diagnostics .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] upper right compares the @xmath202 ratios for the two components to the pdr model predictions .",
    "we still find acceptable solutions for @xmath195 in the @xmath203 range ; for the cvc , the pdr models are pushed to the low end of the density range , while for the broad component acceptable solutions for both diagnostics require @xmath204 and densities at the upper end of the range allowed by the likelihood analysis .",
    "the line ratios plotted in the remaining two figure panels must be regarded as uncertain , since the division of the @xmath205 line flux into cvc and broad components relies on the extrapolation of the cvc model spectrum to lines for which we have only unresolved fts fluxes . however , the constraints imposed by the @xmath206 , and @xmath207 ratios are similar , for both components . for the cvc emission ,",
    "the solutions imposed by matching the @xmath205 line ratios are somewhat at odds with the other pdr constraints : although a similar range of @xmath195 is allowed , satisfying the high@xmath40 line ratios require densities that are much larger ( an order of magnitude or more ) than for the line - to - continuum and @xmath191 ratios .",
    "the cvc @xmath208 line flux would have to be much smaller than our extrapolated value to vitiate this conclusion .",
    "for the broad component , the density constraints can be simultaneously satisfied for all the observed ratios , but the high@xmath40 line ratios require @xmath209 .",
    "if @xmath210 , as seems likely , then there would be no pdr model parameter space in which all of the constraints can be met .",
    "as with the cvc component , there will be acceptable solutions if the broad @xmath205 line flux is much smaller than our estimate , but if this is true , then this rules out a pdr origin for the cvc component , as it must produce the remainder of the line flux .",
    "thus , independent of our modeling , at least one of the two components can not be explained as pdr emission .    in summary ,",
    "the mid@xmath40 and low@xmath40 lines from both the cvc and broad components can in principle arise in pdrs , provided @xmath211 .",
    "however , the higher@xmath40 emission , as represented by the @xmath212 line , does not fit easily into this picture , and at least one of the two components must contain line contributions from a non - pdr source , independent of our decomposition of the @xmath208 line flux .",
    "we therefore conclude that shocks are likely a substantial and possibly dominant heating mechanism for the warm molecular gas in the cvc and broad components .",
    "this seems particularly likely for the broad component , given the identification of this component with the molecular outflow .",
    "x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ) have been found to be the likely excitation source of warm nuclear co emission in galaxies with agn ( e.g. , meijerink et al .",
    "is it possible that the agn in ngc1266 powers the co emission via an xdr ?",
    "a definitive analysis of co emission from an xdr is not possible because the molecular gas densities and temperatures are not constrained tightly enough and because the agn x - ray luminosity is uncertain . while it is possible that the @xmath16 ( @xmath213 and @xmath214 for the cvc cold and warm components , respectively , and @xmath215 and @xmath216 for the broad cold and warm components , respectively , not extinction corrected ) could be accommodated by an xdr ( see bradford et al .",
    "2009 ) , a substantial fraction of co emission arising from an xdr seems unlikely because ( a ) the agn would have to dominate the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy , for which there is presently no observational support , and ( b ) the conversion of hard x - ray luminosity to co luminosity would have to be almost maximally efficient ( @xmath1131% ) .",
    "new _ herschel space observatory _ hifi data enable us to spectroscopically resolve the nuclear central velocity component ( cvc ; 123 km s@xmath25 fwhm ) and broad ( outflow ; 278 km s@xmath25 fwhm ) components of co @xmath2 , @xmath42 , @xmath181 , and @xmath3 lines for the first time .",
    "modeling of the @xmath50 to @xmath3 cvc reveals two components : cold ( @xmath217 k ) , comprising most of the mass ( @xmath218 ) and a minority of the luminosity ( @xmath219% ) , and warm ( @xmath161 k ) , with a minority of the mass ( @xmath220 ) and a majority of the luminosity ( 97% ) .",
    "the cvc @xmath16 is typical of star - forming galaxies and consistent with a modest star formation rate of 6 @xmath221 . with an estimated outflow rate of 13 @xmath221 the reservoir",
    "would be depleted before it could be converted to stars at the current consumption rates , but assuming that the cvc feeds the outflow perhaps 1/3 of the mass is destined to form stars .",
    "our models fail to fit the cvc co spectral line energy distribution in the lowest few lines if the radius is @xmath222 pc , hence we conclude that on order 50% of the emission arises from a larger region , consistent with the previous conclusions of alatalo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    for the broad component identified as an outflow , as for the cvc , the gas densities and pressures were not well constrained , partially because of the relatively large number of temperature components and uncertain velocity decomposition for the high - j lines .",
    "subtraction of the cvc j = 9 - 8 and above model line fluxes from _ herschel _ spire fts line fluxes to estimate the broad component line fluxes yields strong evidence that it also has warm and cold components , with again nearly an order of magnitude more co luminosity arising from the warm component and masses of @xmath223 ( cold ) and @xmath224 ( warm ) . unlike the cvc , the outflow @xmath16 ratio is anomalously high .",
    "extinction corrections under the assumption of well - mixed dust and molecular gas raise the outflow luminosity as much as a factor of 2 but do not have a strong effect on the derived masses .",
    "comparison of the co spectral line energy distribution , far - infrared luminosity , and co modeling results to photodissociation models indicate that the warm components of both the cvc and outflow can not be excited by pdrs ; while just one of them could be , it is likely that both warm components are shock excited ( especially the outflow ) .",
    "thus , our analysis provides strong evidence for the warm outflow gas ( which is responsible for the bulk of the co luminosity and anomalously high @xmath16 ratio ) being shock excited and driven by the agn since the star formation is too anemic .",
    "ngc 1266 remains enigmatic because the nuclear gas , with an apparently short lifetime because of the outflow and star formation , does not have a clear origin .",
    "high angular resolution dust continuum interferometry will be required to further clarify the molecular gas physical conditions and various components , although large - scale mapping ( several 100 pc ) may be required to further elucidate the origin of the molecular gas .",
