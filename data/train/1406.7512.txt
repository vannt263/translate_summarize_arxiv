    "<S> the long time consumption is a bottleneck for the applicability of the ghost imaging ( gi ) . by introducing a criterion for the convergence of gi </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a factor that impacts on the convergence speed of it . based on computer experiments , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the object s feature size relative to the spatial coherent length of the illuminating light impacts on the necessary number of uncorrelated data being acquired for the correlation computation . it may motivate people to seek ways towards real - time practical applications of gi and its analogues . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the method to simulate the uncorrelated sequence of a complex ensemble for thermal light is valuable in applications where actively controlling the light fields is needed . </S>"
