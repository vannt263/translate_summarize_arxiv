    "in its original form , the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite is a relativistic , renormalizable quantum field theory ( qft ) of @xmath0 species of self - interacting fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions with lagrangian @xmath1 the bare mass term @xmath2 explicitly breaks the discrete chiral symmetry @xmath3 of the massless model .",
    "the interaction term can be generalized to acquire a continuous chiral symmetry as in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , but we shall not consider this option here . as far as the phase diagram is concerned , the t  hooft limit @xmath4 , @xmath5 is most instructive .",
    "the reason is the following . in 1 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "classic no - go theorems forbid spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at zero temperature or of a discrete symmetry at finite temperature @xcite . although mean - field theory often predicts these effects , fluctuations are expected to destroy any long range order .",
    "provided that one defines the model by letting @xmath6 before taking the thermodynamic limit , these fluctuations are suppressed and a richer phase structure becomes accessible @xcite .",
    "we follow this line of reasoning here .    like in a previous pedagogical review article",
    "@xcite which the present paper is meant to update , we work canonically , couching the theory in the language of the relativistic hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation . it is formally equivalent to the semi - classical functional integral approach but conceptually simpler . physically , it emphasizes the fact that the dirac sea is an interacting many - fermion system @xcite , thereby making it somewhat easier to switch back and forth between the relativistic qft and condensed matter physics literature .",
    "let us now briefly recall the motivation for studying the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "qft models for which one can construct the exact renormalized phase diagram are extremely scarce and worth investigating on theoretical grounds , even if they are far from being realistic . as a matter of fact , in spite of its simple lagrangian , the gn model shares many non - trivial properties with quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , notably asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation , meson and baryon bound states , chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum as well as its restoration at high temperature and density .",
    "perhaps even more surprising and less widely appreciated is the fact that gn type models have enjoyed considerable success in describing a variety of quasi - one - dimensional condensed matter systems such as the peierls - frhlich model , conducting polymers like polyacetylene , or inhomogeneous superconductors .",
    "the title of this paper has the following background : originally , the kink and kink - antikink baryons first derived in qft by dashen , hasslacher and neveu @xcite have been useful for understanding the role of solitons and polarons in electrical conductivity properties of doped polymers @xcite . in the following years , a lot of progress was made in condensed matter theory towards understanding polaron crystal structures .",
    "this in turn helped us to construct the full phase diagram of the relativistic qft .",
    "however , in order not to confuse the issues , we shall first discuss the gn model without reference to condensed matter physics and comment on the relationship only towards the end .",
    "our last remark about the motivation concerns the restriction to 1 + 1 dimensions . at first glance , this looks very unrealistic .",
    "however , most of the work discussed below has to do with finite chemical potential . in the presence of a fermi surface , a kind of dimensional reduction takes place which has been exploited for instance in high density effective theory ( hdet ) to qcd ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it also manifests itself through the well - known fact that cooper pairing in superconductivity occurs for arbitrarily weak attraction , just like in one space dimension .",
    "hence , from the physics point of view , the restriction to 1 + 1 dimensions is perhaps a better idea in the presence of fermionic matter than naively thought .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) has two bare parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the process of regularization and renormalization ,",
    "all observables can be expressed in terms of two physical parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the relation to the bare quantities and the ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath11 is given by the vacuum gap equation @xmath12 whereas the physical fermion mass @xmath9 in the vacuum merely provides the overall mass scale and can be set equal to 1 , the second parameter @xmath10 ( called  confinement parameter \" in condensed matter physics ) parametrizes different physical theories .",
    "it measures the amount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking and vanishes in the massless ( @xmath13 ) limit .",
    "notice that it can also be expressed in terms of the physical fermion masses at bare mass @xmath8 and in the chiral limit , @xmath14}{m[0]}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{1.3}\\ ] ]    the main subject of this paper is the full phase diagram of the massive gn model as a function of temperature @xmath15 , chemical potential @xmath16 and confinement parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the original works date from 1985 for the massless @xcite and 1995 for the massive case @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier , partial results ) . as has become clear by now , the assumption that the scalar condensate @xmath17 is spatially homogeneous made in these works is too restrictive .",
    "it misses important physics closely related to the existence of kink - antikink baryons in the gn model . in the present paper",
    "we describe how this problem has been cured .",
    "this is not a small correction , but requires a substantial new effort .",
    "a homogeneous condensate acts like a mass and reduces the thermodynamics essentially to that of a massive , free relativistic fermi gas , the mass being determined self - consistently . by contrast , solving the dirac equation with a periodic potential and establishing self - consistency is a highly non - trivial task , even in 1 + 1 dimensions . due to a number of lucky circumstances , this is nevertheless possible in the case at hand , to a large extent even analytically .",
    "in our recent papers we had to proceed from special cases to more general ones ( treating @xmath13 before @xmath18 , @xmath19 before @xmath20 ) in order to reduce the problem to manageable size . now that the original technical difficulties have been overcome , we invert this chronological order .",
    "we start from the most general case , i.e. , the massive gn model at finite temperature and chemical potential , and specialize further wherever additional analytical results or physics insights are available . in this way we can hopefully convey a more coherent picture of what has been learned in the meantime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we remind the reader of the state of the art around the year 2000 and recall our criticism on the widely accepted phase diagram of the gn model at that time .",
    "we motivate the analytical form of the correct self - consistent hf potential in section 3 and sketch the calculation of the grand canonical potential and the proof of self - consistency in section 4 .",
    "section 5 exhibits the revised phase diagram  in full glory \" . in the following four sections we have added various results in the form of figures and analytical formulas which have been obtained in simpler special cases , letting one or both of the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath10",
    "go to zero .",
    "if we take the low density limit @xmath21 at zero temperature , we also recover the properties of individual baryons as summarized in section 10 .",
    "section 11 contains a brief overview of the many cross - relations between the gn model as a relativistic qft and the theory of certain quasi - one - dimensional condensed matter systems .",
    "it is followed by our concluding remarks in section 12 .",
    "let us briefly recall the phase diagram of the gn model as it had been widely accepted by the year 2000 .",
    "this is necessary to put the recent development into perspective . besides",
    ", we will see that the results remain valid in some regions of the phase diagram , including some critical curves .",
    "the most basic quantity at finite temperature @xmath15 and chemical potential @xmath16 is the grand canonical potential . in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "it can be computed either canonically via the relativistic hf approach or by using semi - classical functional integral methods . in the more popular path",
    "integral approach , one introduces an auxiliary bosonic field @xmath22 and integrates out the fermions exactly ( gaussian integral over grassmann variables ) , then applies a saddle point approximation to the remaining bosonic functional integral . in the original analysis at @xmath23 @xcite and its generalization to finite bare fermion masses",
    "@xcite , it has been assumed that the classical value of @xmath22 ( i.e. , the saddle point ) is spatially constant , yielding a ( @xmath24)-dependent dynamical fermion mass @xmath25 .",
    "this mass is found by minimizing the renormalized grand canonical potential density @xmath26 \\label{2.1}\\ ] ] ( @xmath27 ) with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "equivalently , one can solve the self - consistency condition for the ( thermal ) fermion condensate , @xmath28 depending on the parameters ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 possesses one or two local minima with the possibility of a first order phase transition . the phase diagram in the chiral limit @xmath23",
    "is shown in figure 1 , whereas the 3d - plot in figure 2 exhibits the phase structure in the full ( @xmath29)-space .",
    "let us first look at figure 1 .",
    "the line ab is a critical line of second order transitions ( the thermodynamic potential changes from one minimum to a maximum and a minimum ) .",
    "the point b is a tricritical point located at @xmath31 ( all numbers here are in units of @xmath9 ) ; it separates the second order line from a first order line bd along which the potential has two degenerate minima and a maximum .",
    "the endpoint d lies at @xmath32 where the @xmath19 phase transition occurs .",
    "lines bc and be are boundaries of metastability ; when crossed , the potential acquires or loses a second minimum .",
    "in region oabd , chiral symmetry is broken and the fermions are massive ; the outside region has unbroken chiral symmetry and massless fermions .",
    "as the parameter @xmath10 is switched on , the 2nd order line ab disappears in favor of a cross - over where the fermion mass changes rapidly , but smoothly . the first order line on the other hand survives , ending at a critical point .",
    "if plotted against @xmath10 , these critical points lie on the third curve p@xmath33c emanating from the tricritical point as shown in figure 2 . for @xmath34",
    "the effective fermion mass @xmath25 is everywhere different from zero . if one crosses the shaded critical  sheet \" in figure 2 , the mass changes discontinuously , dropping with increasing chemical potential .",
    "1.0 cm    these results looked rather convincing and indeed have been confirmed repeatedly by other authors , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they suffer from one disease which was pointed out in reference @xcite .",
    "the gn model possesses baryons ( multi - fermion bound states ) due to binding effects which are not @xmath35 suppressed .",
    "consider the low density limit of baryonic matter at @xmath19 . since the baryon - baryon interaction is known to be short - ranged and repulsive , one expects widely spaced baryons in the low density limit , implying the following slope of the energy density at the origin , @xmath36 here",
    ", @xmath37 is the baryon mass .",
    "conversely , since equation ( [ 2.3 ] ) is just the chemical potential at @xmath19 , the phase transition at @xmath19 should occur at the critical chemical potential @xmath38 .",
    "the phase diagrams in figures 1 and 2 are in conflict with this expectation . at @xmath23 for instance , the first order phase transition takes place at @xmath32 , whereas the baryon mass is @xmath39 ( always taking out a trivial factor of @xmath0 ) . at the time of writing the article @xcite",
    ", it was already clear that the problem had to do with the assumption of translational invariance . indeed ,",
    "if the single baryon breaks translational invariance , there is no good reason why this symmetry should not be broken at finite baryon densities as well .",
    "( one can actually understand the value of @xmath40 of the critical chemical potential in terms of a droplet model for baryons , characteristic for the mixed phase at low density .",
    "the argument which was first developed in the context of the gn model with continuous chiral symmetry @xcite applies here as well . )",
    "incidentally , a related observation had already been made in 1987 by karsch _",
    "whose numerical lattice calculation gave first hints that kink - antikink configurations play a role in the phase diagram at low density @xcite .",
    "however the authors concluded erroneously that there was a problem with the mean field approach , an opinion which has often been voiced in the literature since then .",
    "this calculation was too crude to determine the phase diagram quantitatively , in particular the statements about the order of the phase transitions are no longer tenable , as we now know .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to relax the assumption of a constant potential , since this requires a major new effort .",
    "this can already be judged from the rather involved single baryon problem @xcite which must be contained as a limit in the full calculation . which potential @xmath41 should replace the constant mass @xmath25 so as to cure the aforementioned discrepancy ?",
    "this will be answered in the next section .",
    "our strategy within the relativistic hf approach is extremely simple in principle : guess the functional form of the hf potential and verify its self - consistency . at finite density",
    "we expect the appearance of a regular array of baryons , hence we will be searching for periodic solutions .",
    "but what guidance do we have to pick the right ansatz ?",
    "is there any reason at all to assume that the exact potential can be given in closed analytical form ?",
    "the following heuristic considerations should be of some help .",
    "owing to the @xmath42-interaction in the lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) , the dirac - hf equation for the gn model assumes the form @xmath43 with real scalar potential @xmath41 .",
    "the representation @xmath44 of the @xmath10-matrices has the advantage that the equations for the upper and lower components @xmath45 of the dirac spinor @xmath46 can be decoupled by simply applying the dirac hamiltonian twice , @xmath47 equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) states that the schrdinger - type hamiltonians with potentials @xmath48 have the same spectra , a textbook example of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with superpotential @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath41 in turn depends on the eigenfunctions @xmath50 and eigenvalues @xmath51 through a self - consistency relation , @xmath52 it generalizes equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) to an @xmath53-dependent scalar potential .",
    "let us first recall the results for single baryons in the massive gn model @xcite .",
    "the scalar potential for a baryon has the form @xmath54 , \\qquad c_0 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\,{\\rm artanh}\\ , y. \\label{3.5}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath55 depends on the bare fermion mass and the number of valence fermions . here",
    "the corresponding isospectral potentials @xmath56 in the 2nd order equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) are given by the simplest pschl - teller potential @xcite @xmath57 and differ only by a translation in space .",
    "the distinguishing feature of potential ( [ 3.6 ] ) is the fact that it is reflectionless ; indeed , this is the unique reflectionless potential with a single bound state .",
    "it is well known that static solutions of the gn model must correspond to reflectionless schrdinger potentials @xcite .",
    "the fact that the ansatz ( [ 3.5 ] ) leads to self - consistency is therefore quite plausible .",
    "take now a lattice of infinitely many , equidistant pschl - teller potential wells .",
    "as pointed out in references @xcite , the lattice sum can be performed yielding a lam - type potential , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 denote complete elliptic integrals of first and second kind , @xmath60 the complementary ones with argument @xmath61 , sn a jacobi elliptic function of modulus @xmath62 ) . comparing the spatial period of both sides of equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) , we can relate @xmath63 and @xmath62 via @xmath64 how does the fact that the single potential wells ( [ 3.6 ] ) are reflectionless manifest itself in the periodic extension ( [ 3.7 ] ) ?",
    "this has been answered long time ago @xcite : the periodic potential has a single gap ( or , in general , a finite number of gaps ) , in contrast to generic periodic potentials with infinitely many gaps .",
    "thus reflectionless potentials generalize to  finite band potentials \" as one proceeds from a single well to a periodic array . in the same way as",
    "the sech@xmath65-potential is the unique reflectionless potential with one bound state , the @xmath66-potential is the unique single band potential . guided by these considerations ,",
    "let us try to find the most general superpotential of the ( single gap ) lam potential .",
    "after a scale transformation @xmath67 @xmath68 should assume the form of the lam potential plus constant , up to a possible shift of the rescaled coordinate ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 or , equivalently , @xmath71 let us try to solve equations ( [ 3.11 ] ) for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we differentiate the upper equation ( [ 3.11 ] ) using @xmath74 and divide the result by the lower equation , obtaining @xmath75 by specializing equation ( [ 3.11 ] ) to @xmath76 we can also determine the constant @xmath73 , @xmath77 incidentally , @xmath72 can be cast into the somewhat simpler form @xmath78 the scale factor @xmath79 in equation ( [ 3.9 ] ) is not constrained by these considerations , so that the final answer for @xmath41 depends on three real parameters @xmath80 . thus we conclude that the potential ( [ 3.9],[3.13 ] ) is the most general dirac potential leading to a single gap lam potential ( plus constant ) in the corresponding 2nd order equations .",
    "this explains why it is a good starting point for finding periodic , static solutions , and has turned out to be the key to the phase diagram of the massive gn model .",
    "incidentally , we did not derive the ansatz for @xmath41 in this way originally , but took it over from a mathematically closely related problem which had already been solved in condensed matter physics , the bipolaron crystal in non - degenerate conducting polymers .",
    "we will have more to say about this relationship in section 11 .",
    "notice also that the simple and intuitive relation between the single baryon and the crystal exhibited in equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) is deeply hidden in the corresponding dirac potentials ( [ 3.5 ] ) and ( [ 3.9],[3.13 ] ) due to the non - linear , non - local relationship between @xmath49 and @xmath56 .",
    "inserting our ansatz into equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) , we arrive by construction at the single gap lam equation in the form @xmath81 using equation ( [ 3.15 ] ) , the relation between dirac eigenvalues @xmath82 and lam eigenvalues @xmath83 is @xmath84 the solutions of equation ( [ 3.16 ] ) are well known since reference @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions are fairly complicated , although they can still be given in closed form , @xmath85 here , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the jacobi eta , theta and zeta function , respectively .",

    "the fact that @xmath41 is a finite band potential is important for getting self - consistency . at the same time",
    ", it makes the problem analytically tractable .",
    "of course , at this point one can not be sure that the simplest finite band potential is sufficient to solve the massive gn model at all temperatures and chemical potential , but this is what eventually will come out .",
    "having picked the ansatz for the scalar potential @xmath41 , we now have to minimize the grand potential with respect to the three parameters @xmath90 and verify that it implies self - consistency of the @xmath91-condensate . in hf approximation ,",

    "the phase diagram which we have discussed in section 5 ( for @xmath13 ) is equivalent to the phase diagram of a theory with lagrangian @xmath280 ^ 2   , \\label{11.3}\\ ] ] provided we reinterpret the chemical potential @xmath281 as axial chemical potential @xmath282 .",
    "the kink - antikink phase of the gn model can then be identified with the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrel ( loff ) phase @xcite of the dual model .",
    "such inhomogeneous superconductors have recently attracted considerable attention in the context of qcd ( for a review article , see reference @xcite ) .",
    "let us now turn to non - relativistic condensed matter physics and demonstrate that the gn model can also be related to quasi - one - dimensional superconductors in nature . in 1981 , mertsching and fischbeck addressed the quasi - one - dimensional peierls - frhlich model with a nearly half - filled band , an electron - phonon system @xcite .",
    "this is the same basic model as the continuum model for degenerate polymers @xcite , but here the phase diagram at finite temperature was considered , notably the transition between commensurate - incommensurate charge density waves . comparing with our results at @xmath13 , we find a mathematical one - to - one correspondence between this system and the gn model now extended to finite temperature .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite have also found the analytic solution to the mean field equation , guided by the landau expansion around the triple point ( which is called leung point @xcite in this context ) .    in a subsequent paper ,",
    "machida and nakanishi @xcite used the phase diagram of reference @xcite in a different physics context : they studied the interplay of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in errh@xmath283b@xmath283 ( erbium - rhodium - boride ) .",
    "they managed to reduce this problem mathematically to the peierls - frhlich model . for real order parameter ,",
    "their results are again fully equivalent to ours for the gn model , except that now one has to use another dictionary : the dirac equation corresponds to the bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) equation , flavor ( @xmath272 ) to spin ( which exists in a quasi - one - dimensional world ) , chemical potential to magnetic field , baryon density to spin polarization .",
    "our three phases ( massive , crystal and massless ) correspond to their bcs ,  sn \" and normal phases , respectively .",
    "not only the phase boundaries , but all observables can be identified if one keeps in mind the above mentioned dictionary .",
    "let us try to understand in more detail the reasons behind this remarkable correspondence .",
    "the bdg hamiltonian involves four fermion fields , namely right ( @xmath284 ) and left ( @xmath285 ) moving electrons with spin up ( @xmath286 ) and spin down ( @xmath287 ) .",
    "this hamiltonian can be mapped onto the peierls - frhlich hamiltonian by the canonical transformation @xmath288 i.e. , particle hole conjugation for spin - down fields followed by a spin - flip of left - moving fields . under this transformation , spin density goes over into ordinary fermion density , and one can understand all other relationships as well .    finally , we would like to mention the more recent work of buzdin and kachkachi @xcite .",
    "they derive the ginzburg - landau theory for nonuniform loff superconductors near the tricritical point in the ( @xmath289)-phase diagram in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "if we take their result for one dimension and specialize it to a real order parameter , we find perfect agreement between our equation ( [ 6.5 ] ) and their equation ( 3 ) in appropriate units .",
    "once again we have to identify their magnetic field @xmath290 with our chemical potential @xmath16 for the reasons discussed above .",
    "at the time of writing our previous review article on the thermodynamics of two - dimensional quantum field theories @xcite , some progress had been made on fermionic models with continuous chiral symmetry like the t  hooft or the njl@xmath291 model .",
    "the fact that the existence of baryons implied a crystal structure of baryonic matter had been understood and the physical interpretation in terms of a gap at the fermi surface  the  rediscovery of the peierls effect in relativistic qft \"  had been clearly stated . towards the end of this article",
    "we identified areas where future work was needed , mentioning in particular the gn model with discrete chiral symmetry .",
    "we hope to have shown in the present work that this problem has been solved in the meantime , including the generalization to the massive model with explicit symmetry breaking . as a result , the situation is now reversed : today we know a lot more about the thermodynamics of the discrete chiral gn model than about the njl@xmath291 model , particularly in the presence of a bare mass term . for a long time",
    "the phase diagram of the njl@xmath291 model was thought to be identical to that of the gn model , but this can now be ruled out due to their different baryon structure .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether one can make further progress on the phase diagram of the massive njl@xmath291 model where topology is expected to play a crucial role , analogous to the skyrme model and skyrme crystal in 3 + 1 dimensions .    in reference",
    "@xcite we also pointed out that this type of soluble qft models still had the potential to surprise us after so many years of studies .",
    "if anything , this impression has only been reinforced since then .",
    "the simple lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) has generated a much richer phase diagram than previously thought , together with some beautiful mathematics .",
    "even more surprising for us was perhaps the discovery that a relativistic qft  toy model \" has such a close relationship to various quasi - one - dimensional condensed matter systems .",
    "we have tried to cover these less familiar aspects of the gn model in the present work as well .",
    "they represent a good example for a fruitful exchange between condensed matter and particle physics .",
    "originally , condensed matter physics , in particular polymer physics , could profit of the particle physicists know - how on soliton - like baryons in the gn model to understand for instance electrical conductivity properties . subsequently the polymer continuum models were vigorously developed , notably in the direction of crystal solutions where the expertise has traditionally been residing in condensed matter physics . during our work",
    ", we were able to take advantage of the progress in polymer physics to settle some unresolved issues in qft , while at the same time generalizing the bipolaron lattice to finite temperature .",
    "this whole process was not as straightforward as it may sound .",
    "it was not that easy for us to find the relevant information in the unfamiliar literature where it was often hidden under a lot of material of less interest to us .",
    "thus we could not avoid doing many things  the hard way \" .",
    "for example the calculation of the phase diagram in the chiral limit , first numerically and then analytically , was performed by us independently of already existing pertinent results in the  parallel world \" of condensed matter physics . in any case , our study of the massive model has profited immensely from this interplay , and it was better to realize and exploit the relationship between these two different branches of physics late than never .    0.5 cm the author wishes to thank the guest editors of this special issue of j.  phys .",
    "a , in particular gerald dunne , for the invitation to write this contribution . a most pleasant and productive collaboration with oliver schnetz and konrad urlichs on the work reported here is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "i also thank both of my collaborators for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
