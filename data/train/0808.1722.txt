    "while it is recognized that long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with very energetic supernovae , sometime referred to as hypernovae , our understanding of the physics that drives and connects these events is far from being established .",
    "observationally , long grbs are more complicated than were thought before .",
    "for example , they appear to have subgroup that includes grb 980425 @xcite , grb 031203 @xcite and grb 060218 @xcite .",
    "these grbs occurred relatively nearby and their energies radiated by prompt gamma rays were significantly smaller than the other long grbs , and they were associated with well - studied hypernovae ( sn 1998bw , sn 2003lw and sn 2006aj , respectively ) .",
    "radio observations of these events @xcite suggest the presence of mildly relativistic ejecta , which is a different component from the usual nonrelativistic component of the supernova explosion .",
    "their rate of occurrence may be an order of magnitude higher than that of the more energetic grbs @xcite .",
    "see also , e.g. , @xcite for other followup studies .",
    "very recently , a mildly relativistic outflow component has also been inferred in a supernova of type ibc unassociated with a grb , sn 2008d @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the broadband radiation from the mildly relativistic ejecta associated with hypernovae , focusing especially on the high - energy photon emission in the x - ray and gamma - ray ranges .",
    "we mainly study the radiation from relativistic electrons which are primarily accelerated in shocks , but we also consider the radiation from secondary electrons which are generated by interactions involving accelerated protons .",
    "the latter were extensively studied by @xcite in connection with the origin of galactic cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "our treatment of the proton component includes also the previously neglected effect of photopair production .",
    "we show that the primary electron component photon signature generally dominates over the proton component , for a wide range of energies .",
    "in particular the inverse - compton scattering of hypernova photons due to the primary electrons appears the most promising channel for detection in the x - ray and gamma - ray ranges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : spectrum of primary electrons ] , we introduce the relevant supernova parameters and the spectrum of the primary accelerated electrons .",
    "we present our main results on the radiation from the primary electrons in   [ sec : radiation from primary electrons ] , and discuss its dependence on the parameters . section  [ sec : radiation from secondary electrons and proton acceleration ] is devoted to a discussion of the photon radiation of a proton origin and its comparison to the electron component .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , there is an empirical relation between the kinetic energy ( @xmath3 ) and the velocity ( @xmath4 ) of the hypernova ejecta , parameterized as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the low velocity component with @xmath7 corresponds to a very energetic supernova , while the high velocity component with @xmath8 corresponds to the mildly relativistic ejecta .",
    "it is assumed that the energy of the ejecta components is dissipated when they start to decelerate , going into relativistic particles .",
    "the deceleration occurs as a result of interaction with the surrounding matter , which we assume is provided by the mass loss of the massive progenitor ( wolf - rayet type ) star .",
    "we adopt a fiduciary mass - loss rate of @xmath9 and a wind velocity @xmath10 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the density profile is then @xmath12 g cm@xmath11 . in this case , the kinetic energy ( @xmath14 erg ) of the mildly relativistic ejecta ( @xmath15 ) starts to be dissipated when it reaches at radius @xmath16 cm .",
    "the corresponding dynamical time scale is @xmath17 s , a few days . around that time , the hypernova luminosity is still very large . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider sub - relativistic but more energetic ejecta , the dynamical time scale is significantly larger , by which time the hypernova luminosity has decreased , a situation that is not interesting for the present purposes .",
    "the hypernova luminosity around a few days after the explosion is roughly @xmath18 erg s@xmath11 , and we assume the spectrum is black body with a temperature of @xmath01 ev ; a typical photon energy is @xmath19 ev . the photon number density at the dissipation radius @xmath20 is then given by @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "we note that the parameter values above are very similar to those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when dissipation starts , we assume a fraction @xmath2 of the kinetic energy goes into primary electrons accelerated to relativistic speed in the shock , and their initial spectrum is a power law with index @xmath23 . a typical lorentz factor ( in the ejecta frame ) of the primary electrons",
    "is then given by @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , we assume a fraction @xmath25 of @xmath3 goes into magnetic fields , yielding @xmath26^{1/2 } = 1 ( \\epsilon_b/10^{-2})^{1/2}$ ] g. we shall study the dependence of results on these parameters in the following , but unless stated , we adopt @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 as fiducial values , according to the analogy to grb emission .    after acceleration , these electrons immediately lose their energies through radiation unless the cooling time scale @xmath30 is longer than the dynamical time scale @xmath31 .",
    "relevant radiation mechanisms include synchrotron radiation due to magnetic field , inverse - compton scatterings off hypernova photons ( external inverse - compton ; eic ) and synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self - compton ; ssc ) . the ratio of cooling time scales of eic and synchrotron processes is given by @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , unless @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath25 , the ssc cooling time scale is at most comparable to that of synchrotron radiation .",

    "the most promising energy range for detecting the electron ssc and eic emission components is in the soft x - ray range .",
    "if both @xmath2 and @xmath25 are reasonably large , the ssc component dominates , while otherwise the eic does ( fig .  [",
    "fig : f1kev ] ) .",
    "the regenerated emission component from electron - positron pairs produced by @xmath136 absorption of @xmath88 gev photons is found to be always negligible .",
    "a robust feature of the eic emission is that it provides fairly large flux in the x - ray regime , for most combinations of the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath25 and @xmath80 , if the supernova occurs at distances @xmath137 mpc .",
    "when the two components are comparable , it may be easy to distinguish them through their very different spectral shapes .",
    "the gev flux is dominated by the eic component .",
    "observations with _",
    "glast _ would make it possible to measure @xmath80 independently , if @xmath2 is large enough , and wold also be able to probe for the spectral cutoff corresponding to the maximum acceleration energy of the radiating electrons .    finally , we briefly comment on the dependence of the results on the progenitor wind mass - loss rate .",
    "this is interesting in particular because @xcite estimated a substantial mass - loss rate @xmath138 for the progenitor of grb 060218/sn 2006aj , which is an order of magnitude larger than the nominal value adopted here .",
    "such a higher mass loss rate decreases the dissipation radius @xmath20 and the dynamical time scale @xmath31 by an order of magnitude .",
    "even if we decrease the supernova luminosity to @xmath139 erg s@xmath11 , an order of magnitude below the nominal value adopted above , while keeping the other parameters the same , we find that both the ssc and eic photon fluxes increase by about 23 orders of magnitude .",
    "this more than offsets the decrease by a factor 3 of the sensitivities of x - ray telescopes caused by the smaller @xmath31 , implying a very significant further improvement in the prospects for detection .",
