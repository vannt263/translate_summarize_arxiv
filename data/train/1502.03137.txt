    "it is now well known that luminous red giants are variable and that the periods of the observed variability lie on discrete sequences in period  luminosity diagrams . @xcite and",
    "@xcite used data from macho observations of stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) to define five sequences a , b , c , d and e in the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath5 , @xmath4 ) planes , respectively ( where @xmath3 is a reddening - free weisenheit index defined as @xmath61.38(@xmath7@xmath6 ) ) .",
    "the sequences a , b and c were identified as containing pulsating stars , while sequence e was found to consist of binary stars and sequence d was the sequence formed by the long secondary periods ( lsps ) that occur in 3050% of luminous pulsating red giants . in this paper , the pulsating stars will be discussed .",
    "these stars lie on sequences a , b and c and two other sequences a@xmath1 and c@xmath1 which are described below .",
    "further examination of the ellipsoidal variables on sequence e can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite while studies of the origins of the lsps can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    following the discovery of sequences a ,",
    "b and c , @xcite used extensive @xmath5 band photometry combined with macho periods to show that sequence b was in fact two sequences which were renamed b and c@xmath1 .",
    "the next refinement to the luminous sequences was by @xcite who used ogle data to show the existence of a new sequence on the short period side of sequence a. @xcite labelled this sequence a@xmath8 but in this paper the designation a@xmath1 will be used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also made the important discovery that sequence a consisted of three closely - spaced parallel sequences .",
    "@xcite claimed that sequences b and a@xmath1 also consisted of three closely - spaced parallel sequences ( hereinafter referred to as sub - sequences ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have drawn attention to a probable faint sequence designated f between sequences c@xmath1 and c.    @xcite assumed that all the variable luminous red giants found by the macho observations were asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars",
    ". however , @xcite and @xcite showed that both agb and red giant branch ( rgb ) stars were variable and that there was a slight offset in period between the sequences of rgb and agb stars .",
    "@xcite also noted this offset but they did not find evidence for two slightly offset sequences for sequence a@xmath1 which they suggested consisted of agb stars only .",
    "however , this result was challenged by @xcite who showed that an rgb component of sequence a@xmath1 does exist .",
    "various attempts have been made to identify the pulsation modes associated with the pulsation sequences c , c@xmath1 , b , a and a@xmath1 and the sub - sequences of b , a and a@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that the radial fundamental mode could fit sequence c with reasonable assumptions about the mass of the star and that the first few radial overtone modes had periods similar to those of sequences b ( which now includes c@xmath1 ) and a , although the data available at the time was not extensive enough for a detailed matching of these latter sequences with modes .",
    "they also noted that the large - amplitude mira variables fell on sequence c , making them fundamental mode pulsators .",
    "additional evidence in favour of this modal assignment is provided by the fact that nonlinear fundamental mode radial pulsation models reproduce the light and velocity curves of local mira variables quite well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , using extensive observational data from ogle , @xcite showed that the period ratios in stars of sequences c and c@xmath1 were consistent with those expected for fundamental mode pulsation of sequence c and first overtone pulsation on sequence c@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite compared period ratios for ogle variables near the tip of the rgb with models and concluded that sequences c@xmath1 , b and a corresponded to the radial first , second and third overtones , consistent with the assignments by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above results , @xcite concluded that the sequences a , b and c@xmath1 corresponded to the radial 2nd overtone , first overtone and fundamental modes , respectively , when they used used radial pulsation models to try fit the sequences in the period  luminosity ( pl ) plane at rgb luminosities ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the longer period sequence c containing the miras has no explanation in terms of radial pulsation .",
    "this study was extended by @xcite who matched the a and b sequences at rgb luminosities to sequences of kepler radial mode pulsators in a pl plane where frequency data was used as a proxy for luminosity .",
    "this result produces a close match between sequences b and a and the radial first and second overtones , respectively , in agreement with @xcite but not with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there thus exists two extant assignments of the radial modes to the pl sequences a , b , c@xmath1 and c that differ by one radial order .    in another study using kepler data , @xcite showed that in the luminous kepler red giants , triplets of modes with periods corresponding to spherical degrees @xmath2=0 , 2 and 1 ( in increasing order of period ) are excited for a given radial order .",
    "the mode with @xmath2=1 has the largest amplitude for radial orders @xmath9=3 or more ( the second or higher radial overtones ) .",
    "this suggests the ogle sequences b , a and a@xmath1 may be dominated by @xmath2=1 modes .    in this paper",

    "are given for each star with the first ( or primary ) period ( p1 ) having the largest amplitude and the secondary periods p2 and p3 having progressively smaller amplitudes ( most luminous red giants exhibit multiple periods of variation ) .",
    "the luminosity in figure  [ wjk - p ] is represented by @xmath12 where the @xmath13 and @xmath5 magnitudes are from the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the individual sequences are labelled in figure  [ wjk - p ] although sequence e ( produced by the binary ellipsoidal variables ) is omitted as these stars are not included in the catalogue .",
    "the tip of the rgb is clearly seen at @xmath14 .",
    "the large - amplitude mira variables are shown as red points in figure  [ wjk - p ] .",
    "they clearly belong to sequence c. as noted in the introduction , there are several lines of evidence which suggest that stars on sequence c are fundamental mode radial pulsators , although some authors have provided arguments against this modal assignment . in section  [ comp_mods ] , we will present what we believe to be compelling evidence that the stars on sequence c are indeed fundamental mode pulsators .",
    "for these reasons , and to simplify some of the discussion , in this paper it will be assumed from here on that the sequence c stars , including the mira variables , are fundamental mode radial pulsators .",
    "it is worth considering at this point what causes the existence of the sequences in diagrams like figure  [ wjk - p ] .",
    "firstly , remember that the period used in figure  [ wjk - p ] is the primary or largest - amplitude period . at a given luminosity ,",
    "a star will have possible modes of pulsation with periods that could fall on any of the sequences or ( as shall be shown below ) between the sequences .",
    "the actual position of a star in the figure is determined by the period of the mode of largest amplitude . for self - excited modes ,",
    "this mode is the one that has the strongest driving - see @xcite for a demonstration of this effect for 1st overtone pulsation on sequence c@xmath1 . for modes that are excited stochastically by convective motions ( solar - like oscillations ) ,",
    "there is also a preferred pulsation period which is related to the acoustic cut - off frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "period  luminosity ( pl ) laws such as those in figure  [ wjk - p ] provide one type of diagram for the comparison of models and observations of variable stars .",
    "a more precise diagram for comparing observations and models is the petersen diagram wherein period ratios in multimode pulsators are plotted against the longer of the two periods in the ratio . in this section ,",
    "a modified petersen diagram appropriate for lpvs is discussed .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ em_strips ] shows the same pl diagram as figure  [ wjk - p ] but now coloured straight lines have been fitted to each of the pulsation sequences c , c@xmath1 , b , a and a@xmath1 . it has been assumed that the three sequences b , a and a@xmath1 have the same slope @xmath15 while the two sequences c and c@xmath1 have a slightly different slope @xmath16 .    since",
    "many of the variable lpvs are multimode pulsators , they can be plotted in a petersen diagram .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] shows a variant of this diagram where the logarithmic period ratios @xmath17/@xmath11 and @xmath18/@xmath11 in each star are plotted against the variable @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] .",
    "the latter quantity is the value of @xmath10 obtained by projecting the actual value of @xmath20 along a line parallel to sequence a until it meets the level @xmath21 .",
    "specifically , @xmath11[@xmath19=12 ] = @xmath22 .",
    "stars with primary periods on a given sequence are thus bounded in the same horizontal range in the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] , with this range corresponding to the values of @xmath10 for this sequence when @xmath23 . for lpvs",
    ", this form of petersen diagram is much better at revealing preferred period ratios than the traditional petersen diagram used by @xcite and @xcite which plots @xmath24 against @xmath25 .",
    "a form of petersen diagram which used a quantity like @xmath11[@xmath19=12 ] on the horizontal axis was presented by @xcite .",
    "the coloured points and short lines in the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] correspond to the ratios of the periods on the fit lines shown in the top panel i.e. they represent the ratios of the periods of the different period  luminosity sequences .",
    "the horizontal position of the coloured point / lines is @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] for the line which is in the denominator of the period ratio .",
    "the colour of the point / line is the colour of the line in the numerator .",
    "coloured points correspond to period ratios of the fits to sequences a@xmath1 , a and b ( these all have the same slope ) .",
    "for example , the red point at ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) @xmath27 ( 1.12 , 0.17 ) represents the ratio of @xmath10 at the middle of sequence a to @xmath10 at the middle of sequence a@xmath1 , the red point near ( 1.3 , 0.0 ) represents this ratio for sequence a to itself and the red point near ( 1.52 , -0.23 ) represents the ratio for sequence a to sequence b. since the lines fitted to sequences c and c have a slightly different slope to that of sequence a , the period ratios of fits involving sequences c or c lead to the short coloured lines .",
    "for example , the short red line at ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath28/@xmath11 ) @xmath27 ( 1.65 , -0.35 ) represents the ratio of @xmath10 at the middle of sequence a to @xmath10 at the middle of sequence c@xmath1 .",
    "we now examine the structure in the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] in detail .",
    "the black points in the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] show observed period ratios for individual stars .",
    "the clustering of these points represents ratios of specific modes present in the data .",
    "firstly , we start with the points in the vertical strip 1.2 @xmath29 @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] @xmath29 1.4 which belong to stars with their primary period on sequence a. there is a large cluster of points near ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.3 , 0.14 ) which one would expect to belong to stars on sequence a that show a secondary period on sequence b. similarly , the cluster of points near ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.3 , 0.3 ) should correspond to stars on sequence a that show a secondary period on sequence c@xmath1 and a third cluster of points near ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.3 , -0.12 ) which should correspond to stars on sequence a that show a secondary period on sequence a@xmath1 .",
    "however , the period ratio of sequences b , c@xmath1 and a@xmath1 to sequence a , represented by the green , magenta and orange points at @xmath10[@xmath19=12]=1.3 , respectively , do _ not _ coincide with these clouds of black points .",
    "it can be seen that this problem exists for stars with primary periods on any of the sequences .",
    "we will explore this situation in detail in section  [ chans ] .",
    "another interesting feature of figure  [ em_strips ] is that there are clouds of points such as those near ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.45 , -0.15 ) for which the primary period lies _ between _ the sequences .",
    "one can see in the upper panel of figure  [ em_strips ] that some stars do have their primary periods between the sequences although they are not as common as the stars on the sequences . in fact , it turns out that the existence of stars between the sequences is related to the problem noted in the previous paragraph and we come back to this in section  [ chans ] .",
    "a prominent feature in the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] is the set of sub - ridges first noted by @xcite and especially prominent for stars on sequence a where five almost - horizontal sub - ridges can be seen in the cluster of points near ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.3 , 0.0 ) .",
    "these five sub - ridges must be due to pulsation modes with very closely spaced periods .",
    "the spacing is sufficiently small that the individual modes can not be distinguished in a pl diagram such as the top panel of figure  [ em_strips ] .",
    "the period separation of low - order radial modes in red giants is much larger than the period separation of the modes belonging to the five sub - ridges of sequence a so nonradial pulsation modes , as well as a radial pulsation mode , must be involved .",
    "the five sub - ridges of sequence a can be created by three closely - spaced modes each separated in @xmath4 by @xmath00.022 , provided that any of the three modes can be the primary mode in at least some stars .",
    "we assume here that this is the case ( if one mode was always dominant , five modes would be required ) .",
    "there is some evidence that there are three sub - ridges , corresponding to two close modes , associated with sequence b ( see the cluster of points around ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.53 , 0.0 ) ) .",
    "this evidence will be made more apparent in section  [ ldep_pr ] .    as noted above , the three modes associated with sequence a must include nonradial modes because of their close spacing .",
    "we assume that all stars on sequence a , and indeed all stars on any given sequence , have the same radial order of pulsation .",
    "nonradial pulsation models of luminous red giants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that for modes of a given radial order but different angular degree @xmath30 , 1 or 2 ( the only ones likely to be observed in light curves ) , the @xmath31 mode has the longest period , the @xmath30 mode has the shortest period and the @xmath32 mode has an intermediate period .",
    "figure  [ em_strips ] provides a method for determining which of the three modes within sequence a is dominant . among the stars with their primary period on sequence a@xmath1 ( the points with 1.05 @xmath29 @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] @xmath29 1.2 ) , those that also have the closely - spaced modes associated with sequence a can be seen near ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.12 , 0.12 ) .",
    "there are three horizontal bands here with the same spacing as the sub - ridges associated with sequence a. the upper band is by far the most prominent . assuming that one mode dominates sequence a@xmath1 (",
    "because there are no prominent sub - ridges near ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) = ( 1.12 , 0.0 ) ) , this band structure suggests that it is the longest period mode on sequence a that generally has the largest amplitude . as noted above",
    ", this is the @xmath31 mode .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath31 mode found on sequence a in the present high luminosity red giants is consistent with the findings of @xcite from kepler observations but different from that of @xcite who find the radial @xmath30 mode becomes dominant at high luminosities in their analysis of kepler stars .     and @xmath31 modes of sequence a when these two modes are present together .",
    "see text for further details . ]",
    ".stars on the sub - sequences of sequence a [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ n_subseqa ]    estimates of the relative amplitudes of the three modes that make up the three sub - sequences of sequence a can be found by examining the populations of the five sub - ridges of sequence a in the petersen diagram .",
    "an exploded view of these sub - ridges is shown in the top panel of figure  [ mode_amps ] .",
    "boxes have been drawn to enclose the sub - ridges and the sub - ridges have been named after the possible modes occurring in them . under our assumption that the three modes involved are the @xmath30 , 1 and 2 modes of a single radial order and that the period increases from @xmath30 to 2 to 1 , a star found in the top box must have @xmath30 for its primary period p1 and @xmath31 for the secondary period ( p2 or p3 ) .",
    "this box has been labelled 0 + 1 .",
    "similarly , the lowest box 1 + 0 must have @xmath31 for its primary period p1 and @xmath30 for its secondary period .",
    "the central box is made up of stars where the same mode is detected twice with slightly different periods and the mode involved could be any of the @xmath30 , 1 and 2 modes .",
    "the two intermediate boxes are labelled by the possible pairs of modes that could be present .",
    "note that the period separation @xmath33 of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 modes obtained from the positions of the sub - ridges agrees with the period separation of these modes given by the observations and the models of @xcite , giving added support for the mode identifications .",
    "the fact that the ridges in boxes 0 + 1 and 1 + 0 are not strictly parallel to the horizontal axis means that @xmath34 varies systematically by a small amount across sequence a. quantitatively , for stars on sequence a , @xmath34 decreases by @xmath00.0045 as @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] increases by 0.1 .",
    "an explanation for this behaviour is given in section  [ prat - m ] .",
    "the number of stars in each box is given in table  [ n_subseqa ] .",
    "the total number @xmath35 of stars with their primary period p1 on sequence a is also given .",
    "this latter number is the total number of stars with @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] lying between the values corresponding to the two vertical lines in figure  [ mode_amps ] .",
    "stars that have both the @xmath31 and @xmath30 modes detected in their light curves lie in boxes 1 + 0 and 0 + 1 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath36 is much smaller than @xmath37 which shows that the @xmath31 mode is much more likely to be detected as the _ primary _ pulsation mode than the @xmath30 mode and this in turn suggests that the @xmath31 mode is likely to have a larger amplitude than the @xmath30 mode .",
    "this is shown directly in the bottom panel of figure  [ mode_amps ] where histograms of modal amplitudes are shown ( the amplitudes come from the ogle iii catalogue ) .",
    "the top sub - panel shows the amplitudes of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 modes for stars in box 1 + 0 , the middle sub - panel shows the amplitudes for stars in box 0 + 1 and the bottom sub - panel shows the sum of the top and middle sub - panels .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath31 mode tends to have the larger amplitude in stars where the @xmath30 and @xmath31 modes are both present although the non - zero population in box 0 + 1 shows that the @xmath30 mode can sometimes have a larger amplitude than the @xmath31 mode .",
    "the amplitude distributions shown in figure  [ mode_amps ] apply to stars with two modes on sequence a. however , about 80% of sequence a stars have only one detected mode on sequence a ( see the fractions in the last column of table  [ n_subseqa ] , and note that stars on the middle sub - ridge have two detections of the same mode ) . assuming that the relative amplitude distributions shown in figure  [ mode_amps ] are typical , the stars with only a single mode on sequence a will be mostly @xmath31 pulsators , in agreement with the result derived above from the stars that have their primary mode on sequence a@xmath1 and a secondary mode on sequence a.    one factor that has not been mentioned above is the orientation of the pole of the pulsating star relative to the observer in the case of nonradial pulsation .",
    "different orientations will cause different apparent amplitudes of pulsation for a nonradial pulsator , with a zero apparent amplitude being possible for specific values of @xmath2 , @xmath38 and the orientation . as a result",
    ", the true numbers of @xmath31 and @xmath32 nonradial pulsators relative to the number of @xmath30 radial pulsators should be higher than indicated by the numbers in table  [ n_subseqa ] .",
    "in section  [ pr ] it was shown that period ratios in individual stars do not agree with the period ratios of the mean sequences . a vivid demonstration of this situation is shown in figure  [ channel ] .",
    "looking at panel a , it can be seen that the secondary periods form three strips parallel to sequence a , but they are closer to sequence a than are sequences a@xmath1 , b or c@xmath1 .",
    "this situation , wherein the secondary modes are closer to the primary mode than are the adjacent sequences to the central sequence , exists for sequences a@xmath1 , a and c. it also exists for the modes shortward of the primary mode of sequence b and for the mode longward of the primary mode for sequence c@xmath1 .",
    "the only exception to this rule occurs for the mode longward of the primary mode of sequence b ( which is further from sequence b than is sequence c@xmath1 ) and for the mode shortward of the primary mode of sequence c@xmath1 ( which is further from sequence c@xmath1 than is sequence b ) .",
    "we come back to this exception later .",
    "we now seek to explain why the green strips in figure  [ channel ] do not align with the sequences .",
    "firstly , it is assumed here that the pulsation modes that produce the green strips are the same pulsation modes as those that produce the corresponding , neighbouring sequences ( where the correspondence is obtained from the ordering in @xmath4 of the strips and sequences ) .",
    "this assumption will be justified in section  [ evsec ] . in this situation",
    ", the period of the same mode must be different on a green strip and on its corresponding sequence .",
    "now , in general , the period of a pulsation mode can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are both positive and for red giants typically range from 1.52.3 and 0.51.9 , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the position of the giant branch at a given luminosity means that @xmath42 . combining these two relations with the definition @xmath43 yields @xmath44 .",
    "thus if a green strip and its corresponding sequence have the same mode but a different @xmath45 at a given @xmath46 then the masses of the stars in the green strip and its corresponding sequence must be different at a given luminosity .    finally in this section , we return to the exceptional cases of ( 1 ) the green strip originating from sequence b which lies on the long period side of sequence c@xmath1 and ( 2 ) the green strip originating from sequence c@xmath1 which lies on the short period side of sequence b. remember that in section  [ pr1 ] , it was deduced that the @xmath31 mode was the dominant mode in sequence a and that this mode has a period which is @xmath00.043 longer in @xmath4 than the radial mode with @xmath30 .",
    "recall also that there appear to be at least two modes ( of the same radial order ) associated with sequence b. we will show later that these are most likely the @xmath31 and @xmath30 modes , with the former being most common . finally , as noted in section  [ seqs ] , stars on sequence c appear to be pulsating in the radial fundamental mode . with these facts in mind , the exceptional cases noted here",
    "can be explained naturally if stars on sequences a@xmath1 , a and b are most commonly pulsating in the @xmath31 mode in both their primary pulsation mode and their secondary modes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , while stars on sequences c@xmath1 and c are most commonly pulsating in the radial @xmath30 mode in both their primary pulsation mode and their secondary modes .",
    "thus the stars with primary modes on sequence b will have @xmath4 for their secondary modes increased relative to @xmath4 of the radial mode pulsators on sequence c@xmath1 by @xmath49 , thereby causing the exceptions noted in points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above .",
    "note that the offset @xmath49 is derived from the populous rgb .",
    "since the slope of sequences c and c@xmath1 is steeper than the slope of sequences a@xmath1 , a and b , this offset will increase with luminosity and will be larger for agb stars .",
    "an alternative explanation for the exceptional cases would be for the stellar mass to decrease from sequence a@xmath1 to a to b , then to increase to sequence c@xmath1 then decrease again to c. this seems contrived and is not consistent with the evolutionary picture described in the next section .",
    "although generally not part of this study , in the last panel of figure  [ channel ] the secondary periods of stars with their primary period on sequence d are shown as green points .",
    "this plot highlights the fact that the periods of pulsation associated with the lsps of sequence d lie mainly on or near sequence b.      the faint sequence f between sequences c@xmath1 and c is marked in figure  [ wjk - p ] . in panel",
    "c@xmath1 of figure  [ channel ] , it can be seen that secondary periods of stars whose primary period lies on sequence c@xmath1 form a sequence close to sequence f. this suggests that the sequence f stars are possibly fundamental mode pulsators like the stars on sequence c. however , it is not clear why the sequence f stars should form a distinct sequence .",
    "one possible explanation is that they are high mass lpvs ( so that their periods are shorter than the periods typical of sequence c stars ) formed in a relatively recent burst of star formation .",
    "against the primary period @xmath11 for stars in the ogle iii catalogue ( black points ) .",
    "evolutionary channels cross each sequence from left to right and stars whose primary periods fall in these channels are plotted as orange points .",
    "the secondary periods @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the stars with @xmath11 in the orange channels are plotted as green points .",
    "see text for further details .",
    "the colours can be seen in the online version of the paper . ]    for most of the stars in pl diagrams such as figure  [ wjk - p ] , mass loss is small so that the evolutionary track of a star is represented by a line of constant mass and pulsation mode .",
    "an examination of pulsation models shows that in the ( @xmath50 ) plane , lines of constant mass and pulsation mode have a smaller slope than the sequences ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ evol ]",
    ", channels similar to those in figure  [ channel ] have been drawn but now the channels are roughly parallel to lines of constant mass and pulsation mode so they represent evolutionary tracks .",
    "the slopes of the tracks are estimated from the pulsation models described in section  [ comp_mods ] .",
    "for convenience of plotting , at lower luminosities on sequences a@xmath1 , a and b , the orange channels have been drawn more tilted relative to the sequences than the models indicate but this does not qualitatively affect the empirical evolutionary scheme presented here .",
    "consider stars in figure  [ evol ] whose primary period lies in the orange strip through sequence a. as stars in this channel evolve to higher luminosity , they slowly move from the short period side of sequence a to the long period side . at the same time",
    ", there is a declining prominence of the secondary period corresponding to the next highest radial order ( the green strip to the left of the orange channel in sequence a ) and an increasing prominence of the secondary period corresponding to the next lowest radial order ( the green strip to the right of the orange channel in sequence a ) .",
    "this means that the primary period most likely detected by observations will move to a lower radial order as the luminosity increases .",
    "thus the orange points representing the evolving stars in figure  [ evol ] will jump from the long period side of sequence a to the short period side of sequence b because the highest amplitude mode has moved from that associated with sequence a to that associated with sequence b. evolution will then continue up and across sequence b before a jump to sequence c@xmath1 and so on .",
    "note that in the empirical scheme shown here , the point of transition of the orange channels from sequence to sequence is judged by eye since current pulsation models do not give reliable theoretical estimates of mode amplitudes .",
    "when a star reaches the rgb tip , it will transit to a lower - luminosity core - helium burning phase before rising again up the agb with a slightly shorter period than it had at the same luminosity on the rgb .",
    "this situation is shown in figure  [ evol ] for the stars in the channel on sequence b. the agb evolution is shown only after the rgb tip luminosity ( @xmath14 ) is exceeded .",
    "the evolutionary scenario described in the previous sub - section has implications for the masses of stars on the sequences .",
    "note firstly that , on a given sequence , stars of different mass will follow essentially parallel tracks but the higher mass stars will be found at higher luminosities .",
    "this means that the mass increases up a sequence , it increases to shorter periods across a sequence at a given luminosity , and it also increases from sequence to sequence at a given luminosity as the radial order increases ( the sequence period decreases ) .",
    "note that a mass difference between sequences was invoked above in order to explain why the period ratios between the sequences did not match the period ratios in individual stars .",
    "the evolutionary scenario provides an understanding for this empirical finding .     in panel",
    "a of figure  [ channel ] . the horizontal position of each star is given by the value of its coordinate @xmath4[@xmath19=12 ] .",
    "the black curve is obtained by using the primary period @xmath11 of each star .",
    "the orange segment of this curve represents the sequence a stars in the orange channel through the middle of sequence a. the green curve is obtained by using the secondary periods @xmath47 and @xmath48 of those stars in the orange channel ( i.e. this is the histogram of the green points in panel a of figure  [ channel ] ) .",
    "the colours can be seen in the online version of the paper . ]",
    "the periods of stars in the various sequences formed in pl diagrams by using the primary or secondary periods can be used to estimate the mass variation from sequence to sequence and the mass variation across sequences .",
    "figure  [ hista ] shows a histogram of the number of stars in a horizontal band defined by @xmath51 in panel a of figure  [ channel ] .",
    "here we are interested in exploring the mass variation from sequence b to sequence a and the mass variation across sequence a. the positions of sequences a and b are marked on figure  [ hista ] .",
    "the peak in the green distribution at @xmath4[@xmath19=12 ] @xmath27 1.44 is formed by sequence a stars whose secondary periods are produced by the pulsation mode which produces sequence b. the difference @xmath52 in the positions of this peak and the sequence b peak is caused by the different masses of stars on sequences a and b. pulsation models for low radial order modes at the luminosities and masses of the stars involved here show that , at a given luminosity , @xmath53 ( this result comes from the pulsation models described in section  [ comp_mods ] ) . thus the shift @xmath54 corresponds to the average mass of stars on sequence a being approximately 26% larger than the average mass of stars on sequence b.    mass variations _ within _ a sequence are also required .",
    "these mass variations make a large contribution to the finite width in @xmath4 of the sequences , with the mass increasing to shorter periods across the sequences .",
    "let us consider sequence a. the total width of this sequence ( represented by the full - width at half maximum ) is @xmath55 . as well as the mass variation across the sequence ,",
    "there is also a contribution to the sequence width from the period variability represented by the vertical width of the sub - ridges in the top panel of figure  [ mode_amps ] .",
    "this contributes approximately @xmath56 to the observed width of sequence a , leaving the contribution from mass variation alone at @xmath57 .",
    "the sub - sequences of sequence a ( i.e. the multiple modes ) will also make a small contribution to the width but we ignore this .",
    "the width @xmath57 means that the mass increases by about 29% from the longer period to the shorter period side of sequence a.    in the evolutionary scenario described above , the mass variation across a sequence should be equal to the mass variation between sequences .",
    "remember that stars jump between sequences from the long period edge of one to the short period edge of the other .",
    "thus the masses of stars on the long period side of a sequence should be the same as the masses of stars on the short period edge of the adjacent longer period sequence .",
    "consequently , the mass difference between the short period edges of two adjacent sequences will be the mass difference across the shorter period sequence .",
    "the results given above for sequences a and b show that the mass difference between these two sequences is indeed close to the mass difference across sequence a.    the procedure applied above to determine the difference in the average masses of stars on sequences a and b can be applied to other pairs of sequences in which stars pulsate mostly in the same mode .",
    "we find that stars on sequence a@xmath1 are @xmath017% more massive than stars on sequence a at luminosities around @xmath21 .",
    "the difference in the average masses of stars on sequences c@xmath1 and c can not be readily determined at this luminosity since the mode of sequence c is rarely seen there . however , near @xmath58 , which is on the agb , many stars exhibit primary and secondary oscillations in both of the modes associated with sequences c@xmath1 and c. the period shifts indicate that the stars on sequence c@xmath1 are @xmath016% more massive than those on sequence c. to derive this result we used the formula @xmath59 rather than @xmath53 which is appropriate at lower luminosities on the rgb ( these formulae are derived from the pulsation models described in section  [ comp_mods ] ) . finally , we consider sequences b and c@xmath1 .",
    "comparing the masses of stars on these two sequences is difficult at any luminosity because of the paucity of stars that exhibit both the sequence b and c@xmath1 modes , and because the stars with primary periods on sequence b appear to be @xmath31 pulsators while stars with primary periods on sequence c@xmath1 appear to be @xmath30 pulsators .",
    "we do not make any estimate of the mass difference between these two sequences .",
    "although figure  [ em_strips ] demonstrates the existence of secondary periods in many lpvs , it does not indicate how the presence of secondary periods varies with luminosity .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the secondary periods can be seen in figure  [ lum_dep ] . for each sequence",
    ", this figure plots @xmath60 against the secondary period relative to the primary period whose position is marked by a vertical blue line .",
    "the vertical strips of black points show where individual secondary modes are present in the stars .",
    "the radial order of the modes associated with these secondary modes are indicated by coloured numbers , with radial order 1 corresponding to the fundamental mode ( see section  [ comp_mods ] for the justification of the assignment of radial orders ) .",
    "the positions of the individual sequences are indicated by coloured dots in each panel .",
    "the fact that the dots and numbers of the same colour do not align horizontally ( except for the reference mode ) is yet another demonstration of the fact that the ratio of the periods in individual stars do not match the ratio of the periods of the sequences .",
    "panel a@xmath1 of figure  [ lum_dep ] shows the ratio of secondary to primary period for stars whose primary period lies on sequence a@xmath1 .",
    "looking at this panel , we see three closely - spaced vertical bands under and slightly left of the red 4 .",
    "these bands are caused by the three modes occurring on sequence a. the longest period mode ( the @xmath31 mode ) becomes dominant as the luminosity increases .",
    "this result is also seen for stars with their primary period on sequence a ( see panel a ) .",
    "there are five vertical bands associated with sequence a and these are caused by the the three modes present within this sequence .",
    "as discussed in section  [ pr1 ] , the shortest period band is produced by stars whose primary mode has @xmath31 and whose secondary mode has @xmath30 while the longest period band is produced by stars whose primary mode has @xmath30 and whose secondary mode has @xmath31 .",
    "the shortest period band extends to higher luminosities than the longest period band which suggests that the @xmath31 mode is more prominent as the primary period ( i.e. the one with largest amplitude ) at higher luminosities .",
    "once again , we note that the dominance of the @xmath31 mode at higher luminosities on sequence a is consistent with the findings of @xcite from kepler observations but different from the findings of @xcite who suggest that the radial @xmath30 mode becomes dominant at high luminosities .    the stars with their primary mode on sequence b show three of the outer bands of sequence b are cause by the 1-year alias of the primary period , so this feature is not real .",
    "a similar 1-year alias can be seen in the bands of sequence a near @xmath61 if the figure is expanded . ]",
    "vertical bands associated with the primary mode ( panel b of figure  [ lum_dep ] ) .",
    "this structure indicates the presence of two close modes but they seem to be confined to rgb stars only ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "only one mode appears to be present on the agb .",
    "panel b in figure  [ lum_dep ] reveals the presence of apparent extra modes not present in any other panel . in a simple sequential assignment of radial orders ,",
    "there appear to be secondary modes present corresponding to radial orders 5 and 6 .",
    "however , looking at panel a@xmath1 immediately above panel b , it can be seen that the mode structure associated with the radial orders 4 and 5 in panel a@xmath1 is reproduced exactly in panel b. another point to notice is that the horizontal position of radial order 2 in panel a@xmath1 coincides exactly with the position of sequence b. we conclude from these facts that stars whose primary mode lies on sequence b are of two types : ( 1 ) stars pulsating in the third radial order with secondary periods in the second and fourth radial orders , and ( 2 ) stars pulsating in the second radial order with secondary periods in the third , fourth and fifth radial orders .",
    "the type 2 stars are more massive than type 1 stars and they have masses typical of stars on sequence a@xmath1 .",
    "these type 2 stars are really stars belonging to sequence a@xmath1 but the observed amplitude of the radial order 2 pulsations is larger than the observed amplitude of the radial order 5 pulsations so they end up on sequence b. the apparent extra radial orders in panel b have been labelled by their true radial orders using numbers in brackets .    if we consider the stars on sequence b whose primary mode is of radial order 3 ( panel b of figure  [ lum_dep ] ) , we see that the secondary modes pulsating in radial order 4 form two bands with the shorter period band being overwhelmingly dominant ( the apparent band on the short period side of the radial order 4 group belongs to radial order 3 of the type 2 stars examined in the last paragraph ) . given that there are two possible primary modes of radial order 3 , the dominance of the shorter period band in panel b suggests that the dominant primary mode is the longer period one .",
    "the separation @xmath63 of the two modes associated with radial order 3 ( derived from the separation of the vertical bands associated with this order in panel b of figure  [ lum_dep ] ) is consistent with the separation of the @xmath64 and the @xmath65 modes of radial order 3 in the models of @xcite .",
    "these results therefore suggest that the @xmath64 and the @xmath65 modes are present on sequence b and that the @xmath31 mode is dominant .",
    "the direct finding that the @xmath31 mode is dominant on both sequences b and a is consistent with the suggestion in section  [ chans ] that the @xmath31 mode is dominant on each of sequences b , a and a@xmath1 .",
    "in this section , period ratios observed in individual stars are compared to period ratios in radial pulsation models of red giants . the linear , non - adiabatic pulsation models were computed with the code described in @xcite using the same input parameters ( abundances , mixing - length , turbulent viscosity parameter , core mass ) as in that paper . evidence was presented in section  [ chans ]",
    "that , in a given star , both the dominant primary pulsations and the secondary pulsations correspond to modes of the same spherical degree @xmath2 .",
    "thus , although the nonradial @xmath31 mode appears to dominate the primary pulsations in sequences a@xmath1 , a and b , provided the ratio of the @xmath31 to the @xmath30 periods is approximately the same for radial orders 3 to 5 associated with these sequences , the observed period ratios in individual stars should be the same as the period ratios in radial pulsation models . in figures",
    "[ lum_dep+mods ] and [ lum_dep+wrong_mods ] the observed period ratios in individual stars are compared to the period ratios in radial pulsation models .    in figure",
    "[ lum_dep+mods ] , it is assumed that the radial mode associated with sequence c ( the mira sequence ) is the fundamental mode ( radial order 1 ) and that sequences c@xmath1 , b , a and a@xmath1 correspond to successively higher radial orders of pulsation .",
    "it can be seen that for each of the panels in figure  [ lum_dep+mods ] , the model period ratios match the observed period ratios well for some mass in the range 0.8 to 2.4m@xmath66 except for the highest mass and luminosity models in panels c@xmath1 and c. this problem is discussed in section  [ model - mass ] .",
    "note that in panel b , there is a mismatch between the models and those vertical bands that really belong to sequence a@xmath1 ( as described in section  [ ldep_pr ] ) but this is expected because of the different masses of stars on sequences a@xmath1 and b. overall , these results provide strong evidence that the primary pulsation modes associated with sequences c , c@xmath1 , b , a and a@xmath1 belong to radial orders 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "it also provides strong evidence that both primary and secondary pulsations in a given star tend to belong to the same @xmath2 value .    in figure  [ lum_dep+wrong_mods ]",
    ", it is assumed that the radial mode associated with sequence c@xmath1 is the fundamental mode ( radial order 1 ) and that sequences b , a and a@xmath1 correspond to successively higher radial orders . clearly , the mode marked by the cyan number 1 ( sequence c ) has no explanation in terms of radial modes with this assignment of radial orders .",
    "furthermore , even for higher radial orders , the ratios of mode periods in the models fail to match the observed ratios .",
    "we therefore reject this modal assignment .",
    "the finding here that sequences c , c@xmath1 , b , a and a@xmath1 correspond to radial orders 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 is consistent with most earlier findings ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this assignment is inconsistent with the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite that sequence c@xmath1 corresponds to radial order 1 .    in terms of nonradial modes ,",
    "we find direct evidence for the presence of the @xmath65 mode on sequences a and b and for the @xmath32 mode on sequence a. in their analysis of ogle iii data , @xcite claim to find the presence of the two nonradial modes .",
    "firstly , they associate the @xmath67 mode of radial order three - mode @xmath68 corresponds to radial order 3 in this paper . ] with sequence b while the only nonradial mode we find has @xmath65 . secondly , they find the @xmath65 mode of radial order 5 associated with sequence a whereas we associate radial order 5 with sequence a@xmath1 and we find the @xmath65 mode of radial order 4 associated with sequence a. because @xcite only looked at lpvs on the rgb designated as osargs in the ogle iii catalogue , all lpvs with periods on sequences a@xmath1 and c were excluded ( by definition , osargs on the rgb do not have these modes ) so they had an incomplete picture of the modes involved .",
    "in addition , the petersen diagram they used meant that a number of modes overlapped on the figure causing confusion .      in the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] ,",
    "the various clusters of points representing period ratios of specific pairs of modes tend to form ridges that are not horizontal .",
    "for example , we now know that the ridge at ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) @xmath27 ( 1.3 , 0.3 ) corresponds to stars whose primary pulsation mode belongs to radial order 4 and whose secondary pulsation mode belongs to radial order 2 .",
    "this group of points , and most of the other groups of points , form ridges such that the period ratio becomes smaller when moving from the long period side of the primary mode sequence to the short period side .",
    "it was shown in section  [ mvarinseq ] that the mass of stars in a sequence increases when moving from the long period side to the short period side of the sequence .",
    "this suggests that the cause of the non - zero slope of the ridges in the lower panel of figure  [ em_strips ] is mass variation across sequences .",
    "the models shown in figure  [ lum_dep+mods ] confirm this .",
    "if we take the example given above for the ridge at ( @xmath10[@xmath19=12 ] , @xmath26/@xmath11 ) @xmath27 ( 1.3 , 0.3 ) , panel a of figure  [ lum_dep+mods ] shows that the period ratio of radial order 2 to radial order 4 modes decreases as the model mass increases , just as suggested by the slope of the ridges .",
    "it was noted in section  [ pr1 ] that the ratio of the periods of the @xmath31 and @xmath30 modes of radial order 4 increased slightly from the long period side to the short period side of sequence a ( the opposite slope to the cases considered in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "this result provides evidence for the mass dependence of the period ratio of the @xmath31 and @xmath30 modes , with the period ratio increasing with mass .",

    "furthermore , in sections  [ pr1 ] and [ chans ] it was shown that the period of the @xmath65 mode is longer than the period of the @xmath64 mode by @xmath33 . hence , to compare the models with the observations , the computed periods for radial orders 3 , 4 and 5",

    "looking at sequence c in figure  [ masses ] , it can be seen that fundamental mode pulsation in stars with masses in the range 0.82.4 m@xmath66 explains most of these stars , with some stars outside this mass range required to explain the full length of the sequence ( note that the present - day population of red giant stars in the lmc peaks at masses around 1.6 m@xmath66 e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "stars in a similar mass range , but pulsating in the radial first overtone mode can explain the stars on sequence c@xmath1",
    ". similarly , this mass range fits sequences @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 but at lower luminosities , as expected from the empirical evolution scheme described in section  [ evsec ] .",
    "the mass required to fit these three sequences at a given luminosity increases when moving from sequence @xmath75 to @xmath76 to @xmath77 , consistent with the results derived in section  [ mvarinseq ] from the empirical evolution scheme .",
    "in addition , the width of sequence a requires a significant range of masses to be present at a given luminosity .",
    "this is also consistent with the results derived in section  [ mvarinseq ] .",
    "given the various results presented in this paragraph , there appears to be reasonable agreement between the models and the observations in the ( @xmath60 , @xmath4 ) plane in spite of the potential difficulties mentioned above .",
    "there is one parameter on which the models and the empirical evolution scheme are in relatively poor agreement .",
    "this is the transition luminosity at which stars move from one sequence to the next , especially in the case of the transition from sequence c@xmath1 to sequence c. looking at the evolutionary track for a 1.6 m@xmath66 star ( i.e. the orange lines in figure  [ masses ] ) , we see that the first overtone mode does not cross the long period edge of sequence c@xmath1 until @xmath78 . according to the empirical evolution scheme , the star should then jump to the short period edge of sequence c and start pulsating in the fundamental mode at @xmath78 .",
    "however , the period of the fundamental mode of the 1.6 m@xmath66 star at this stage puts the star at the _ long _ period edge of sequence c or beyond .",
    "this suggests that the ratio of the fundamental to first overtone periods in the models is too large .",
    "actually , the disagreement between the models and the observations is not as bad as just suggested .",
    "if we look at panel c@xmath1 of figure  [ lum_dep+mods ] , we see that the logarithmic period difference @xmath34 between the fundamental mode to the first overtone mode is @xmath00.26 around @xmath79 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the difference @xmath80 between the long period edge of sequence c@xmath1 and the short period edge of sequence c. at @xmath81 , @xmath34 for the 1.6 m@xmath66 star is indeed @xmath82 but by @xmath83 @xmath34 is much too large at @xmath84 so that there is still a discrepancy between the model period ratios for the first two modes and the observed ratio of these two modes .",
    "it is worth noting that the discrepancy discussed here seems to be worst at high masses and luminosities . at @xmath85m@xmath66 ,",
    "the models predict a transition from the long period edge of sequence c@xmath1 to the short period edge of sequence c which is as predicted by the empirical evolution scheme .    finally , we take a look at the period difference between rgb and agb stars .",
    "the lines drawn in figure  [ masses ] belong to both rgb and agb stars .",
    "the computed separation of the rgb and agb periods for each mode at a given luminosity is almost imperceptible on the plot ( the separation can just be seen for the 0.8 m@xmath66 models ) .",
    "it is certainly much less than the period shift of @xmath86 evident on sequence a when moving from the rgb at @xmath62 to the agb at @xmath87 .",
    "the observed period shift can not be explained by mass loss between the rgb tip and the agb since mass loss increases the period of pulsation whereas the period is observed to decrease .",
    "the models thus predict that there is a very small period change between the rgb to the agb for a given mode .",
    "a possible interpretation of the much larger period shift observed on sequence a when going from the rgb to the agb is that the agb is dominated by radial ( @xmath30 ) pulsators while the rgb is dominated by nonradial @xmath31 pulsators ( remember that @xmath49 for the period ratio of the @xmath31 and @xmath30 modes ) .",
    "however , this result conflicts with the results in section  [ ldep_pr ] which suggested that the @xmath31 mode becomes more dominant at higher luminosity .",
    "the observational resolution of this conflict awaits larger data sets such as those that will come from ogle iv .",
    "multiple pulsation modes in stars in the ogle iii catalogue of lpvs in the lmc have been examined .",
    "it has been shown that the ratios of the multiple periods in individual stars do not agree with the ratios of the periods of the sequences of lpvs in the pl diagram .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the average masses of stars on the different sequences vary , with the shorter period sequences containing more massive stars .",

    "fitting pulsation models to the period ratios in multimode pulsators shows that the sequences c , c@xmath1 , b , a and a@xmath1 correspond to pulsation in radial orders 1 to 5 , respectively ( with radial order 1 corresponding to the fundamental mode ) .",

    "the relative populations and amplitudes of the modes of different @xmath2 show that the @xmath31 mode is the most common and of the largest amplitude in both sequences .",
    "the positions of secondary mode sequences relative to primary mode sequences in the pl diagram also suggest that the @xmath31 mode is the most prominent primary and secondary mode on sequences a@xmath1 , a and b and that the @xmath30 mode is the most prominent primary and secondary mode on sequences c@xmath1 and c. this result is supported by the good fit of the period ratios in radial pulsation models to the observed period ratios .",
