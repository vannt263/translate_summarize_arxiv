    "the klein - gordon equation is a fundamental physical equation describing the motion of a spin - less particle , see for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a physical introduction on this topic and @xcite , @xcite and the references therein for the mathematical analysis , and in particular @xcite for some long time results when the equation is set on a compact domain , the case mainly considered in the present work .    in the relativistic regime ,",
    "i.e. the speed of light @xmath1 , the klein - gordon equation ( as a non - linear wave equation ) is numerically well studied , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , for long time behavior results in the weakly nonlinear regime , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the klein - gordon equation in the non - relativistic limit regime , i.e. the speed of light @xmath0 tending to infinity .",
    "thus , our model problem reads @xmath2 where we will consider essentially the case @xmath3 , @xmath4 , assume that the initial condition @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not depend on @xmath0 , and consider periodic boundary conditions in the space variable . in this regime the klein - gordon equation has recently gained a lot of attention , see for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( when equation is set on the whole space @xmath7 ) .",
    "numerically , the highly oscillatory nature of the exact solution is very challenging as standard numerical schemes require severe time step restrictions depending on the large parameter @xmath8 , see for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a numerical overview on highly oscillatory problems . in the recent work @xcite , gautschi - type exponential integrators ( proposed in @xcite for equations with high frequencies generated by the linear part ) were applied to the non - relativistic klein - gordon equation , which allow time steps of order @xmath9 .    following the one - term asymptotics results given in @xcite we study in this paper the existence of a complete asymptotic expansion of the exact solution of in terms of @xmath10 over a @xmath0 -independent interval @xmath11 , and for smooth initial data .",
    "this will allow us to construct numerical schemes which do not need to obey any @xmath0-dependent smallness restriction . in a nutshell ,",
    "the asymptotic expansion up to the first - order correction term of reads @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 solve the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations @xmath15 the essential point is that the highly - oscillating part in the asymptotic expansion is only contained in the phases @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but does not appear in the above schrdinger equations for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in particular the numerical time integration of can be carried out without any @xmath0-dependent time step restriction .",
    "thus , with this asymptotic expansion we are able to obtain a well suited numerical approximation to the exact solution @xmath18 of the klein - gordon equation in the non - relativistic limit @xmath19 , without any time step restriction as we only need to solve the schrdinger equations and multiply the numerical approximations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the highly - oscillatory phases @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "note that in comparison with @xcite and motivated by numerical implementation , we choose to work here with periodic boundary conditions , that is the space variable @xmath20 the @xmath21-dimensional torus .",
    "moreover , we show that for sufficiently smooth initial values the asymptotic expansion of the exact solution to exists up to an arbitrary order , and can be reconstructed by superposing highly oscillatory terms to cascaded solutions of @xmath0-independent schrdinger - like systems .",
    "after a full discretization of these cascaded terms , we are able to build numerical schemes which approach the exact solution up to errors terms of order @xmath22 by simulating the terms in the asymptotic expansion up to order @xmath23 with a numerical scheme of order @xmath24 in time ( with step size @xmath25 ) and fourier pseudo - spectral discretization on a grid with mesh size @xmath26 .",
    "note that here , @xmath26 and @xmath25 can be chosen independently of @xmath0 , and that @xmath27 depends on the regularity of the solution and of the degree of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we commence in section [ sec : boundi ] with the essential a priori bounds on the exact solution of the klein - gordon equation showing the existence on a time interval independent of the large parameter @xmath0 . in section [ sec : asymp ] we will derive an asymptotic expansion of the exact solution in powers of @xmath10 . in section [ sec : firstt ]",
    "we will precisely state the first terms in this expansion , which will allow us to construct numerical schemes which are robust with respect to @xmath0 , see section [ sec : nume ] .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sec : enq ] we analysis the asymptotic behavior of the conserved physical quantities .",
    "we consider our model problem set on the @xmath21-dimensional torus @xmath28 .",
    "we make the following assumptions :    the initial values @xmath5 and @xmath6 are smooth functions independent of c. furthermore we assume that the nonlinearity @xmath29 is gauge invariant and polynomial of degree @xmath30 in @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this means that for all number @xmath33 and all @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 .",
    "eventually , we assume that @xmath29 is _ real _ in the sense that for all @xmath34 , we have @xmath36 . in particular , this shows that if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in @xmath39 , then the solution @xmath18 is real for all times .",
    "typical examples of such nonlinearity are given by the polynomials @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "for ease of presentation and numerical motivations , we will mainly work on the @xmath21-dimensional torus @xmath28 , @xmath42 .",
    "however , as the only arguments used in the sequel are the local lipschitz nature of the nonlinearity in sobolev space and some explicit calculations for diagonal operators in fourier , the reader should be convinced that all the result of this paper can be easily extended to functions defined on @xmath7 .    for a function @xmath43 , @xmath20 in @xmath44 we set @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 , denote the fourier coefficients associated with @xmath48 . here , we have set @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for a given @xmath51",
    ", we define the operator @xmath52 in fourier , the operator @xmath53 is represented by the diagonal operator with coefficients @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the kronecker operator . in particular note that the operator @xmath56 is uniformly bounded with respect to @xmath0 : we have for all @xmath47 , @xmath57 , which implies that for all functions @xmath48 , @xmath58 . with these notations ,",
    "equation can be written as @xmath59 in order to rewrite the above equation as a first - order system in time , we set @xmath60 note that we have @xmath61 and if @xmath31 is real , then @xmath62 .",
    "a short calculation shows that in terms of the variables @xmath48 and @xmath63 equation reads @xmath64 i \\partial_t v & = & -c{\\langle \\nabla \\rangle_c}v   + c{\\langle \\nabla \\rangle_c}^{-1 } f(\\textstyle \\frac12 ( \\overline u +   v ) ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ] the initial boundary conditions associated with this problem are ( see ) @xmath65 eventually , we set @xmath66 v \\end{pmatrix } , \\quad \\boldsymbol{f}({\\boldsymbol{w } } ) = \\begin{pmatrix }   f(\\textstyle \\frac12 ( u + \\overline v ) ) \\\\[1ex ] f(\\textstyle \\frac12 ( \\overline u +   v ) ) \\end{pmatrix } , \\quad \\mbox{and}\\quad { \\boldsymbol{\\psi}}= \\begin{pmatrix } \\varphi - i c { \\langle \\nabla \\rangle_c}^{-1 } \\gamma \\\\[1ex ] \\overline{\\varphi } - i c { \\langle \\nabla \\rangle_c}^{-1 } \\overline{\\gamma } \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] so that the problem - can be written as @xmath67 we see that this equation is posed on @xmath68 . for an element @xmath69 , we set @xmath70 in the previous and in the following , if an operator - like @xmath53 - acts on @xmath71 , we naturally extend diagonally its action on @xmath72 by setting for instance for @xmath73 , @xmath74 the solution of the linear equation ( @xmath75 in the previous equation ) can be written as follows : for @xmath76 , @xmath77 where the right hand - side is easily defined in fourier by the formula @xmath78 where @xmath79 denote the ( vector valued ) fourier coefficients of @xmath80 .",
    "note that the linear flow is an isometry in the sense that for @xmath81 , @xmath82 note that in the sequel , and because the equation is set on the torus , we will not use any argument involving strichartz estimates as in @xcite but we will require more regularity on the initial conditions @xmath6 and @xmath5 .    as we assume that the function @xmath29 is polynomial of degree @xmath83 in @xmath31 and @xmath84 the application @xmath85 satisfies estimates of the form @xmath86 for @xmath87 , with some constants @xmath88 , and for @xmath89 and @xmath90 in @xmath72 .",
    "these estimates are consequences of classical bilinear estimates in @xmath71 : @xmath91 for some constants @xmath92 .",
    "moreover the assumption that @xmath29 is real implies that for all @xmath93 , @xmath94 .    with these notations ,",
    "the mild formulation of is given by @xmath95 using the fact that the linear flow @xmath96 is an isometry in @xmath71 and that @xmath56 is a bounded operator in @xmath71 , in particularly uniformly bounded with respect to @xmath0 , we easily derive the following result by a standard fix point argument combined with :    [ prop21 ] let @xmath87 and @xmath97 a given constant . then there exist constants @xmath98 and @xmath99 such that for all @xmath51 and for all @xmath100 such that @xmath101 , there exists a mild solution @xmath102 to the equation , and such that @xmath103    in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath63 , the previous proposition can be reformulated as    [ cor21 ] let @xmath87 , and assume that @xmath104 and @xmath105 are given . then there exist constants @xmath98 and @xmath99 such that for all @xmath0 there exists a mild solution @xmath106 to the equation satisfying the initial boundary conditions and such that @xmath107    using the expression for @xmath80 in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the fact that @xmath56 is uniformly bounded in with respect to @xmath0 , we obtain that @xmath101 , a constant independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that proposition [ prop21 ] applies .",
    "this corollary immediately gives the existence of the exact solution @xmath18 of on a time interval @xmath108 and with @xmath71-bounds both independent of @xmath0 .",
