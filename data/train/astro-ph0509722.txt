    "the origin of short grbs has long been the subject of theoretical speculation .",
    "a long - standing prediction is that short grbs might originate from ns+ns / bh mergers ( e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) . in the widely favored scenario",
    "a ns+ns / bh system gives rise to a bh girded by a dense torus of gas from the disrupted ns companion .",
    "the bh accretes mass at rates up to many solar masses per second , releasing huge amounts of gravitational binding energy mostly in neutrinos , gravitational waves , and through magnetohydrodynamic processes .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite  @xcite ; ajm05 ) show that thermal energy deposition around post - merger bh - torus systems , e.g. ,  by neutrino - antineutrino annihilation , can drive collimated , ultrarelativistic outflows with the high lorentz factors , internal variability and internal shocks that are deemed necessary to explain grbs with the fireball model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the collimation of observed short grbs is rather uncertain and a matter of ongoing studies .",
    "evidence for collimation was claimed in case of grb  050709 ( @xcite ) , for which a jet semi - opening angle of @xmath3 was inferred .",
    "although more observations are needed to confirm the collimation of short grbs , this first indication seems to agree with the hydrodynamic simulations of ajm05 .",
    "if the majority of short bursts has opening angles of that size , it would mean that only about 1% of all bursts point to earth .",
    "only in the past year have a few short grbs been localised .",
    "their properties are recapped in table  1 .",
    "two of these short grbs are hosted by elliptical galaxies , and also the host galaxy of grb  051221 appears to have a relatively evolved population of stars , despite its higher star - formation rate .",
    "this adds confidence to the idea that the progenitors of short grbs are old systems .",
    "in addition , grb  050509b is in the outskirts of its potential host , in agreement with expectations that coalescing compact binaries can travel large distances away from their birth sites during their long gravitational - wave driven inspiral @xcite .",
    "moreover , a possible sn association has been ruled out for grb  050509b @xcite and for grb  050709 @xcite .",
    "three out of five short grbs were detected at similar redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , but their intrinsic isotropic - equivalent energy release in gamma rays , @xmath5 , spans a factor of @xmath6100 .",
    "the observation of intrinsically less energetic short grbs at higher redshifts may be selected against . in this paper",
    "we use the jet models of ajm05 to discuss theoretical predictions for the observable properties of short grbs as a function of viewing angle ( sect .",
    "[ sec : jets ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ sec : observability ] we investigate the consequences of these models for the probability of observing short bursts with different isotropic equivalent energies and lorentz factors , including the selection effects due to cosmological redshift . a summary and conclusions follow in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "by means of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations ajm05 studied the formation of ultrarelativistic outflows from bh - torus systems .",
    "the bh and torus masses and the deposition of thermal energy around the bh were chosen as expected from ns+ns / bh merger models . for different assumptions about the environment density and for varied geometry and time - dependence of the energy deposition rate , ajm05 followed the acceleration , collimation , and propagation of the ultrarelativistic outflows for an evolution time of 0.5 seconds .",
    "if the deposition rate of thermal energy per solid angle around the bh was sufficiently large , ultrarelativistic jets were launched along the rotation axis .",
    "although these simulations are still far from taking into account all potentially relevant physics and did not self - consistently track the viscosity - driven torus evolution and its neutrino emission , they nevertheless provide useful insight into the conditions and properties of mass outflows from post - merger bh - torus systems .    the fact that an ultrarelativistic jet is launched from a `` naked '' bh - torus system has important consequences for its properties . while in the case of collapsars",
    "as sources of long grbs the ultrarelativistic outflow originates from bh - torus systems at the center of a massive star , the polar jets in ns+ns / bh mergers do not have to plough through many solar masses of overlying stellar matter .",
    "since the acceleration is not damped by swept - up matter , the jets very quickly reach lorentz factors of a few .",
    "the acceleration is driven by the enormous radiation pressure of the pair - photon fireball produced by the energy release around the bh .",
    "collimation of the baryon - poor jets is provided by the much denser torus walls which gird the evacuated polar regions of the bh . as the jets propagate into the extremely low - density environment",
    ", they continue to accelerate , reaching maximum lorentz factors of a few 100 within the simulated evolution time .    as a consequence of the interaction with the torus matter at the jet basis and the subsequent free expansion",
    ", the collimated ultrarelativistic outflows possess flat core profiles with only little variation of radially - averaged specific properties .",
    "these cores are bounded at their lateral edges by very steep gradients , which are not smoothed by the prolonged entrainment of baryons as in case of long grb jets .",
    "the rapid decrease of the isotropic - equivalent energy as a function of @xmath7 implies , among other effects , that the probability of observing the lateral , lower lorentz factor wings must be expected to be significantly reduced .",
    "figure  [ fig : jetproperties ] provides an overview of the hydrodynamics results for the sample of `` type - b '' models discussed by ajm05 . in these simulations",
    "the bh - torus system was assumed to be surrounded by a very rarified medium .",
    "the models differ in the adopted rate of thermal energy deposition per solid angle and in the prescribed time dependence .",
    "the parameters were chosen such that the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation as calculated from ns+ns / bh merger simulations , and in particular for the post - merger accretion of a bh @xcite , was qualitatively and quantitatively reproduced .",
    "because of large variations of the torus masses expected from compact object mergers , ajm05 explored a variety of energy deposition properties , approximately covering the range of predictions from the above merger simulations ( cf .",
    "table  1 in ajm05 ) .",
    "the corresponding differences in the assumed energy deposition around the bh - torus systems account for the variation of the on - axis values of the _ isotropic - equivalent kinetic plus internal energies _ , @xmath8 , of jet matter with estimated terminal lorentz factors @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties ] , left ) .",
    "@xmath10 is estimated by assuming that 50% of the total specific energy will ultimately be converted to kinetic energy at large radii is beyond the scope of the hydrodynamic models of ajm05 , because the simulations do not include physics that plays a role during the later stages of the jet acceleration . ] .",
    "the models span a range of @xmath11 in @xmath12 , from some @xmath13erg to several 10@xmath14erg . depending on the efficiency of energy conversion to @xmath15-ray emission",
    ", the measurable @xmath15-ray energy ( @xmath5 ) may be roughly a factor of 10 lower than @xmath8 ( e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "all models show a flat core and steep lateral wings in the radial average of @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties ] , right ) , but models b07 and b08 have a somewhat more shallow decline of @xmath12 because a gradual decrease of the energy deposition rate was assumed after an initial , burst - like phase .",
    "this caused a continuous decrease of the jet opening angle , thus softening the wings of the jet profile .",
    "it is currently not clear whether the jet - driving energy release of the bh - torus system follows such a burst / slow - decay behavior or whether it is powerful and roughly constant over a longer period of time before it ceases more abruptly , as assumed in the other models ( b1b6 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : jetproperties2 ] provides some observationally relevant quantities deduced from the hydrodynamics results .",
    "the profiles of @xmath8 given in the left panel there represent the isotropic - equivalent values of energy which is potentially radiated from the outflow in different directions .",
    "these profiles are calculated from the jet energies of fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties ] , taking into account radiation contributions coming from regions outside of the line of sight . in order to compute these contributions ,",
    "let us consider an amount of energy @xmath17 that is radiated into the solid angle @xmath18 at angle @xmath19 relative to the direction of motion ( primed quantities are measured in the local comoving frame ) .",
    "the transformation of the energy per solid angle between the comoving frame and the laboratory frame ( e.g. ,  a frame at rest with respect to the central bh ) is ( @xcite ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the velocity of the comoving frame as measured in the laboratory frame .",
    "comparing the values of @xmath22 at two different angles , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one finds that the energy emitted per unit of solid angle around an angle @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the energy radiated along the direction of propagation ( @xmath24 ) as @xmath26 if the radiation field is isotropic in the comoving frame .",
    "the emission from the jet in a certain observer direction @xmath25 can now be obtained as the sum of the contributions from all matter moving in different directions with velocities @xmath27 at angles @xmath28 relative to the jet axis , yielding @xmath29 since the profiles of @xmath30 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties ] are related to the energy radiated per unit solid angle into different directions @xmath31 , the integration given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecorr ] ) can be directly applied to these profiles in order to obtain the isotropic equivalent energy distributions corrected for off - line - of - sight contributions .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties2 ] . from the latter figure it is obvious that energy release with @xmath32erg is confined to semi - opening angles between about 10@xmath33 and 20@xmath33 , corresponding to a collimation ( `` beaming '' ) factor of the two polar jets of @xmath34 between 1.5% and 6% .",
    "the relative observability of a short burst from a model of our set at different polar angles @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties2 ] , middle panel .",
    "we plotted there the quantity @xmath35 where as a rough estimate for the detectability of a burst we assumed @xmath36 ( using for @xmath8 the data from the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties2 ] ) .",
    "the probability distribution confirms the steep lateral edges visible in the other quantities for models  b01b06 and the slightly softer wings in models  b07 and b08 , which correlate with a sharp drop of the average lorentz factor .",
    "the probability @xmath37 peaks at angles between 4@xmath33 and @xmath611@xmath33 , which is a somewhat smaller range than that associated with @xmath38erg .",
    "morever , @xmath37 nicely demonstrates the widening of the lateral visibility of a grb with increasing energy deposition per solid angle around the bh ( cf .  the sequence of models  b02 , b04 , b06 , b01 , and b05 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic jet models of ajm05 track the formation of ultrarelativistic grb - viable outflow .",
    "it turns out that the `` shells '' ejected by the central engine , i.e. the bh - torus system , accelerate much faster in the leading part of the outflow than the shells in its lagging part .",
    "the rear shells need therefore a longer time to reach velocities @xmath39 .",
    "this different acceleration at early and late times of the relativistic wind ejection leads to a stretching of the overall radial length of the outflow , @xmath40 , relative to the on - time @xmath41 of the central engine times the speed of light @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching ] ) .",
    "this stretching has the important consequence that the overall observable duration of the grb ( in the source frame ) , @xmath44 , may be a factor of ten or more longer than the activity time of the central energy source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching ] ) , even when the grb is produced by internal shocks .",
    "this is only seemingly in conflict with the canonical fireball picture as discussed , e.g. ,  by @xcite , who draw the conclusion that `` internal shocks continue as long as the source is active , thus the overall grb duration @xmath45 reflects the time that the inner engine is active '' .",
    "it should in fact be noted that grb light curve calculations in these shell collision models are based on the assumption that the shells move with _ constant lorentz factors and with a velocity very close to the speed of light _ , which means that the expansion of the shells is considered only _ after the preceding acceleration away from the central engine_. therefore the `` shell emission time from the inner engine '' @xcite or `` ejection time '' @xcite or `` activity time of the inner engine '' @xcite referred to in these works corresponds to the overall length the fireball has attained _ in the saturated stage _ after the initial acceleration .",
    "this time can only be identified with the real activity time or on - time of the central engine , whose energy output launches and drives the initial shell ejection , if the shells accelerate to nearly the speed of light within a negligibly small period of time . only in this case",
    "the claim of equal emission and source activity times applies and can be traced back to the fact that a photon radiated from a fireball shell is observed almost simultaneously with a ( hypothetical ) photon launched at the central engine together with the radiating shell @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic jet simulations , however , show that the acceleration time , in particular for the shells ejected later , is not negligible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching ] ) .    taking the terminal length @xmath46 of the ultrarelativistic outflow in direction @xmath7 as a very crude measure of the overall observed duration @xmath47 of a burst as the radial extension of those parts of the outflow which reach terminal lorentz factors @xmath9 , where @xmath10 of a mass element in the outflow is again calculated by assuming that 50% of its total energy will finally be converted to kinetic energy . ] , we have plotted this duration relative to the on - axis value in the right - hand panel of fig .  [ fig : jetproperties2 ] .",
    "the off - axis variations of the possible grb durations are sizable .",
    "bursts which are seen more than 5@xmath4810@xmath48 off - axis have only 30%60% of the on - axis duration .",
    "the outflow stretching can easily be the dominant effect determining the duration of short grbs , but it is not possible to assess its relevance for long bursts without hydrodynamical modeling .",
    "this is due to the more complex and largely different dynamics of the collimated relativistic outflow caused by the presence of the massive star in the collapsar model .",
    "predictions of the absolute duration of the grb emission based on jet simulations where the period of energy release was just a parameter are hard to make .",
    "self - consistent torus evolution models , including the energy production mechanism and the feedback from jet formation , will be needed to provide reliable numbers for the duration of the source activity and the differential acceleration of the ejecta shells at early and late times . moreover",
    ", the jet structure at 0.5@xmath49s after the jet creation , at which time ajm05 had to stop their calculations , may not be representative for the situation at the time when the grb is produced .",
    "we can employ our set of jet models to attempt to predict the observable short - grb distributions versus redshift @xmath0 , fluence , isotropic equivalent energy output in @xmath15-rays , @xmath5 , and lorentz factor @xmath16 of the flow that produces the bulk of the measured @xmath15-radiation .",
    "we discuss these aspects in view of the observed bursts of table  1 .",
    "our methodology is different from that of other groups , who used observational data of grb redshift , luminosity , and peak flux distributions to derive constraints on the intrinsic properties ( event rates or lifetimes , jet collimation , luminosities ) as functions of redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we instead refer to the sample of jet models from ajm05 to define the intrinsic distribution of short grb energies as a function of viewing angle for the individual events .",
    "this approach suffers from the huge uncertainties of the theoretical models ( see below ) and naturally can have only a tentative character .    in order to perform the analysis",
    ", we assume that our models have equal probability and are representative of the intrinsic variability of the short grb source population at all redshifts .",
    "this is a crucial assumption and it can certainly be questioned , but currently it can hardly be replaced by more realistic alternatives , because the uncertainties concerning the link between ns+ns / bh binary parameters and grb properties are still large .    in order to test the sensitivity of our analysis to a variation of the comoving short grb rate density as function of redshift , @xmath50 , we consider three cases , namely an intrinsic grb rate which ( i ) is constant with comoving volume , ( ii ) follows the star formation rate sf2@xmath51sfr of eq .",

    "better agreement is therefore found when the simulation predicts a larger number of nearby events .",
    "highest preference is attributed to the constant grb rate density , in which the relative fraction of visible bursts at @xmath93 is largest .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the recent analysis by nakar et al .",
    "( @xcite ; see fig .  5 there ) , who found that the well - localized bursts imply a high local rate of short - hard grbs events , and that long lifetimes of the progenitor systems are favored .",
    "given the small number of events , the results clearly will change significantly with every new observation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the fluence distributions show the expected increase towards faint events , and the distribution of @xmath5 reveals a strong bias towards events with higher isotropic - equivalent energies , corresponding to near - axis observation .",
    "such events are much more likely to yield a fluence above the threshold values at large redshifts and are also preferred because of the steepness of the jet wings , which reduces the probability of seeing events from those wings .",
    "grb  050509b is an exceptionally weak event , which is well separated from the other observed bursts , and which the theoretical distributions do not account for .",
    "it thus distorts the ks measures for the fluence and energy distributions , which otherwise signal reasonably good compatibility between calculations and observations , in particular for the higher fluence threshold .",
    "grb  050509b is most probably _ not _ an off - axis observation , but requires either an event with lower energy output than for any of the jet models in our sample , or an efficiency of the energy conversion to @xmath15-rays lower than assumed here .",
    "the latter is disfavored by the observations of @xcite .",
    "these authors also discard grb  050509b as an off - axis event on the basis of the very early decay of the afterglow light curve .",
    "the probability distribution of the lorentz factor reflects the discreteness of our sample of models , because the redshift has no influence on @xmath16 and because the jet wings are extremely steep and the off - axis visibility much reduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties ] ) .",
    "therefore , the high - energy model  b05 with a relatively wide jet clearly sticks out in the @xmath16-distribution .",
    "a continuous set of models would enhance and broaden this peak , and the `` underwood '' of events extending to low values of @xmath16 would even be more reduced if terminal lorentz factors @xmath10 instead of @xmath16 were plotted .",
    "we hypothesize that this clear bias towards observing high-@xmath16 events may be connected with the lack of short - soft grbs in the duration - hardness diagram .",
    "short bursts are on average harder than long bursts , and short - soft bursts are rare or missing , because short grbs develop jets with higher lorentz factors and very steep edges .",
    "the underlying reason behind this effect is the fact that jets from post - merger bh - torus systems do not have to make their way out of a massive star through layers of dense stellar material , which can damp the outflow acceleration by mass entrainment . in the commonly used internal shock scenario for the grb emission",
    "the peak energy of the ( synchrotron ) spectrum , @xmath94 , obeys the relation @xmath95 with @xmath96 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in view of our jet models",
    "this would imply that short bursts might have lower @xmath94 but nevertheless be harder than long ones because of a steeper increase of the @xmath97 spectrum below the peak .",
    "the results of ghirlanda et al .  ( @xcite ) seem to confirm this .",
    "their spectral analysis for a sample of short bright grbs detected by batse in comparison with the spectral properties of long bright batse bursts indeed reveals a significantly harder ( i.e. , less negative ) spectral index @xmath98 rather than a larger peak energy @xmath94 for short grbs .",
    "this leads to an increased hardness ratio if @xmath94 is above the higher energy band of the spectral hardness measure , or overlaps with it , which is the case for almost all of the short grbs listed in table  1 of ghirlanda et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that the difference between the peak spectral energies of short and long bursts might even be more pronounced than found by ghirlanda et al .",
    "( @xcite ) if long bursts occurred at typically higher redshifts and the intrinsic values of these energies were compared .",
    "however , the discussion by zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) also leaves possibilities how in the internal shock model higher lorentz factors of short grbs may be compatible with _ higher _ peak spectral energies . in case of poynting - flux dominated outflow ,",
    "zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) expect a direct proportionality , @xmath99 ( see their eq .  21 and case ( b ) in their fig .",

    "17 ) when @xmath101 is the radius where internal shock collisions produce @xmath15-ray emission ( see , e.g. , piran 2005 ) .",
    "although short grbs have higher @xmath16 s compared with long grbs , their variability timescale @xmath102 might be generically much smaller .",
    "this would result in a smaller shock dissipation radius and therefore in a higher @xmath94 , because magnetic fields may be stronger at a smaller radius .",
    "using a set of hydrodynamic simulations of ultrarelativistic jet formation by thermal energy release around bh - torus systems as remnants of ns+ns / bh mergers ( ajm05 ) , we have investigated the off - axis visibility of short grbs produced by such outflows .",
    "the jets are characterized by narrow cores with high isotropic - equivalent energies and very high lorentz factors , which are laterally bounded by steep wings .",
    "these properties are a consequence of the specific conditions in which the jets are considered to be launched , i.e. , their acceleration away from the torus - girded bh , where the energy is released , into an environment of extremely low density .",
    "the observability of short grbs is therefore strongly favored within a cone of semi - opening angle between about 10@xmath48 and 15@xmath48 around the jet axis .",
    "we argued that the observable duration of short grbs both in the external shock model and in the internal shock collision model for grb production can be significantly longer than the activity time of the central engine whose energy release powers the grb - viable ultrarelativistic outflow .",
    "the reason for this claim is the fact that our jet formation simulations showed that during the acceleration phase the fireball experiences significant radial stretching , because hydrodynamic effects cause the acceleration to proceed differently in the leading and lagging parts of the outflow .",
    "therefore the overall radial length @xmath40 of the relativistic ejecta can become a factor of ten or more larger than @xmath103 , when @xmath41 is the on - time of the central engine ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching ] ) .",
    "this seems to be in conflict with the canonical internal shock scenario , according to which the observed grb is produced by shell collisions such that the observed light curve reflects the temporal activity and overall duration of the energy release by the `` inner engine '' @xcite .",
    "however , the standard picture applies only if the fireball shells move immediately after their ejection with velocities that are very similar ( but not necessarily identical ) and very close to the speed of light .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that a photon radiated from a fireball shell is observed almost simultaneously with a ( hypothetical ) photon emitted from the central engine together with the radiating shell @xcite .",
    "if the acceleration is differential , and in particular if the acceleration of shells ejected by the central engine at later times proceeds more slowly , the fireball evolution after creation at the engine is more complex ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stretching ] ) .",
    "its emission pattern then does not directly replicate the activity timescales and the on - time of the central source .    in order to investigate the consequences of the reduced off - axis visibility of short grbs produced by our jets",
    ", we made an attempt to predict observable short - hard grb distributions with redshift , fluence , isotropic - equivalent energy , and lorentz factor .",
    "for this purpose we made use of a sample of seven ultrarelativistic jet models ( ajm05 ) , which roughly covers the range of energy release expected from neutrino - antineutrino annihilation in ns+ns / bh binary mergers . employing these models for defining the intrinsic grb properties",
    ", we performed a monte carlo sampling of the expected observed event distributions .",
    "our analysis took into account the off - axis variation of the jet properties as provided by the hydrodynamic simulations ( figs .",
    "[ fig : jetproperties ] and [ fig : jetproperties2 ] ) and referred to standard prescriptions for the intrinsic event rate density as a function of redshift ( constant rate as well as the cases sf2@xmath51sfr and sf2+delay from @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the resulting distributions predict far too many bursts at @xmath2 and therefore show no good agreement with the recent observations when a fluence threshold of @xmath91erg@xmath49@xmath82 as suggested by grb  050509b was adopted ( the ks probability for the observed and predicted data being drawn from the same distribution is less than 1% ) .",
    "improved consistency was achieved when we performed our analysis with a higher fluence threshold of @xmath104erg@xmath49@xmath82 . in this case",
    "the bursts at @xmath105 escape from observation and the ks significance increases to @xmath620% for the constant comoving grb rate density .",
    "this would imply that grb  050509b was a very special and extremely rare case with an exceptionally low fluence , which due to its shortness and proximity still had a sufficiently large photon flux of about 1@xmath49photon s@xmath106@xmath82 and was therefore above the swift detection threshold .",
    "comparison of the results for different comoving grb rate densities revealed that the consistency between theory and observations increases when the rate yields a relatively larger number of events at redshifts @xmath107 rather than an increase for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "our results agree qualitatively with those of nakar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who found that the detection of the current sample of low-@xmath0 short grbs is best compatible with a very low comoving rate density for @xmath2 and a peak at @xmath107 .",
    "the extremely weak grb  050509b is clearly separated in energy from the other observed events and can not be accounted for by off - axis observation of any of the modelled jet outflows .",
    "it seems to require an intrinsically less energetic event , because an efficiency of energy conversion to @xmath15-rays significantly lower than what we used is disfavored by observations @xcite . on the other hand , the very energetic grb  051221 exceeds the isotropic - equivalent grb energies predicted by our jet models , making the assumption that 10% of the ejecta energy can be converted to radiation in the detector frequency band .",
    "if , however , this fraction is as high as suggested by the measurements ( 6070% for the total efficiency in case of grb  051221 ; @xcite ) and grb  051221 happened indeed at a redshift of 0.546 and not farther away , then this strong burst is also within the reach of the most energetic one of our models if observed near - axis .",
    "therefore we do not think that grb  051221 gives strong support to speculations that different progenitors and/or different energy extraction mechanisms than neutrino - antineutrino annihilation are needed to explain the observed large spread in short burst energies and the high energy of grb  051221 in particular @xcite .",
    "because of the steep wings of the jet profiles in both isotropic - equivalent energy and lorentz factor @xmath16 , our analysis reveals a clear bias towards the detection of short grbs with high @xmath16 values .",
    "since higher lorentz factors and steep jet edges may be characteristic features of grb jets that originate from post - merger bh - torus systems , which makes them different from collapsar jets , we propose that they are the reason why short grbs are typically harder than long ones . in the internal shock scenario for grb emission",
    ", this might imply that the peak energy of the synchrotron spectrum is lower ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "short bursts could therefore be harder not because of a higher @xmath109 but because of a steeper increase of their @xmath97 spectra below the peak energy .",
    "this would require the spectral maximum to lie above or inside the high - energy band for the hardness ratio .",
    "such properties were indeed concluded from a spectral analysis of a sample of short bright batse grbs in comparison with long burst spectra ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "alternatively , a higher @xmath16 could still allow for a larger @xmath109 if the variability timescale @xmath102 of short grbs were generically much smaller than that of long grbs .",
    "we point out that our exploration can only be tentative .",
    "both the theoretical models and observational data still involve large uncertainties , which have an impact on our analysis .",
    "not only did we take a very simplistic approach in estimating the @xmath15-ray production of our jet models in the energy band of the detector .",
    "we just assumed that a fraction of 10% of the ejecta energy is converted to @xmath15-emission at the relevant frequencies .",
    "we also did not account in detail for the instrument specific detection probability that depends on the photon flux and thus on the burst luminosity , spectrum , and redshift , but simply assumed that all short grbs above a certain fluence threshold are detected , independent of their peak luminosity and spectral properties .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic short grb rate per unit of comoving time and comoving volume enters the analysis sensitively .",
    "nakar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that the well - localized short grbs , which are all at @xmath110 , require a very large number of nearby events .",
    "this implies that the local number density of double neutron star binaries or neutron star - black hole systems is significantly above previous estimates , if short grbs come from such objects .",
    "in fact , it must be dominated by a so far undetected old population of double neutron stars or , alternatively , by observationally unconstrained ns+bh systems .",
    "a caveat of such conclusions and of comparisons to the observations is , of course , the still very small sample of well - localized short grbs .",
    "caution is therefore advisable until the empirical foundation is more solid ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we restricted our analysis to the properties of the prompt emission of short grbs , which may originate from neutrino - annihilation driven hydrodynamic jets , launched by the neutrino energy release of a hyperaccreting bh girded by a massive torus .",
    "of course , one can not exclude that magnetohydrodynamic effects might play a role that deserves more theoretical exploration .",
    "the discovery of x - ray flares following the short - duration , hard pulse of grb  050724 after hundreds of seconds ( barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) was interpreted as observational hint for the importance of such magnetic processes ( fan , zhang , & proga 2005 ) .",
    "if these late - time x - ray flares are indeed connected with an extended period of activity or a restart of the central engine long after the prompt emission is over ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 , zhang et al .",
    "2005 , liang et al .",
    "2006 ) , it seems not possible to explain these late outbursts by the accretion - rate dependent neutrino mechanism ( fan , zhang , & proga 2005 ) . a prompt phase of neutrino ( or neutrino plus magnetic ) energy release that creates the short - hard grb may thus be followed by a much more extended period of reduced source activity , in which x - ray flares could be powered by a magnetic mechanism ( fan et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "admittedly , our investigation of the implications of the off - axis properties of short grb jets from post - merger bh - torus systems was also based on a very limited set of numerical models ( ajm05 ) .",
    "this theory input of our analysis replaces the intrinsic peak luminosity function based on measured data used in other works ( e.g. ,  nakar et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the models were chosen to span approximately the possible diversity of the properties of ultrarelativistic outflows from such systems , but certainly represent it only incompletely . in particular , they were calculated with a single setup for the bh - torus system , in which the deposition rate of thermal energy and its spatial distribution ( expressed in terms of the opening angle of the axial cone of the main energy deposition ) was varied over a range guided by the results for neutrino - antineutrino annihilation in independent binary merger and post - merger evolution models .",
    "neither was the torus evolved self - consistently in response to this energy release and to the jet formation , nor were magnetohydrodynamic effects included in the models .",
    "there is still a long way to go before the challenging problem of fully consistent modeling becomes manageable .",
    "this should include all relevant physics and track in full general relativity the history from the last orbits of the pre - merging binary , through the merging phase , to the possible bh formation and the subsequent secular post - merging evolution of the accreting relic black hole .",
    "such simulations will ultimately have to be performed for a carefully selected sample of progenitor systems , which avoids the `` arbitrariness '' of the variations in our current set of models .",
    "knowing that this goal is still far ahead and in view of the fact that the simulations available to us represent the present state - of - the - art of modeling collimated relativistic outflows from post - merger bh - torus systems , we tried to explore how far this information can help us bridging grb engine theory and observations .",
