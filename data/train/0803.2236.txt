    "in general relativity ( gr ) , there are four variables characterizing linear cosmic perturbations : the two gravitational potentials @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the anisotropic stress , @xmath15 , and the pressure perturbation , @xmath16 .",
    "all of these variables can depend on the wave number , @xmath17 , and the expansion factor @xmath1 .",
    "we focus initially on models with no dark energy clustering or pressure and discuss these effects later in the paper .",
    "we assume scalar linear perturbations around a flat frw background in the newtonian gauge , ds^2 = -(1 + 2 ) dt^2 + a^2(1 + 2)dx^2 and work in the quasi - static , linear approximation , which is valid for sub - horizon modes still in the linear regime .",

    "( [ growth ] ) one can infer the two key features of gr with smooth dark energy .",
    "first , the growth factor is exactly determined once the hubble function @xmath22 is known ; and second , since none of the coefficients is a function of scale , the growth factor is scale - independent",
    ". therefore , for a given expansion history , one can test gr in two ways : checking that the theoretical solution of eq .",
    "( [ growth ] ) agrees with observations , and testing the hypothesis of scale - independence @xcite .",
    "the growth rate of structure in gr is well approximated by @xmath23 , where the fitting function @xmath24 is accurate at the @xmath25 level @xcite .",
    "we define a function that tests the growth rate of structure and can be directly related to observables : ( k , a ) = _ m^-(a ) -1 = -1 .",
    "[ eq : eps ] the combination @xmath26 can be constrained via cmb measurements ; it is currently known to within the 5% level fro the wmap5 data @xcite , with an expected gain of a factor @xmath27 from the upcoming satellite cmb mission planck @xcite . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] shows @xmath28 in gr with dark energy : regardless of the details of the dark energy model , @xmath29 in the linear regime . by measuring this quantity",
    ", we can characterize deviations from general relativity .",
    "to quantify the expected deviations , we study a class of modified gravity ( mog ) models known as @xmath10 theories , whose action is written as = d^4 x ( r + f(r ) ) + _ m ; @xmath30 is the action of standard matter fields .",
    "it has been noted long ago @xcite that models where @xmath10 is an inverse power of the ricci scalar can give rise to late - time acceleration ; however , many of those models have been shown not to be cosmologically viable due to gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "+ recently , song , hu and sawicki @xcite introduced an effective parametrization for @xmath10 theories which does not rely on any particular model and is able to discard models suffering from instabilities .",
    "the cosmological evolution is obtained by fixing the expansion history to match that of a dark energy model , for which we assume a constant equation of state @xmath31 : h^2 = h^2_0 ( _ m a^-3 + ( 1-_m ) a^-3(1+w ) ) .",
    "such requirement for @xmath22 translates into a second - order equation for @xmath10 , which can be solved numerically .",
    "of the two initial conditions of this equation , one can be fixed requiring that @xmath32 at early times ( for large @xmath33 ) in order to recover gr ; the second defines a one - parameter family of curves which all generate the given @xmath22 .",
    "such parameter is conveniently chosen as ( also see @xcite ) : [ bhu ] b_0 = ( r)_0 . here",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the first and second derivative of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "gr is represented by the special case @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 effectively quantifies the deviation from gr at the present time .",
    "furthermore , the gravitational stability condition is easily established as @xmath39 .",
    "+ the additional degrees of freedom of the @xmath10 gravity introduce modifications in the poisson equation and in the relation between the two gravitational potentials @xcite , which now read : [ poisson ] k^2 ( - ) = 4g_eff(k , a ) a^2 _ m _ m and = ( g(k , a)-1 ) ( - ) .",
    "the equation for the growth factor in mog takes the form : [ growthmg ] d  + ( 2 + ) d+ _ m d = 0 .",
    "given @xmath22 , a mog model is not completely defined unless @xmath40 , the effective newton s constant , and the metric ratio @xmath41 , are known , contrary to the gr case . for the class of @xmath10 theories under study , and in the sub - horizon , linear regime , hu and sawicki @xcite have provided a fit to @xmath42 and @xmath43 as [ g ] g_eff(k , a ) & = & g_eff(a ) = , + g(k , a ) & = & , where @xmath44 is the function appearing in eq .",

    "+ the key result is that the @xmath10 models all predict an enhancement in the growth rate of structure .",
    "in fact , any positive value of @xmath38 gives rise to a negative @xmath34 , so that the effective newton constant is larger with respect to gr .",
    "moreover , both terms in @xmath46 have a negative sign , which induce further enhancement of matter clustering , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ growthmg ] ) .",

    "peculiar velocities displace galaxies along the line of sight in redshift space and distort the power spectrum of galaxies observed in redshift space .",
    "this effect is known as linear redshift space distortion and was first derived by kaiser @xcite . in redshift - space , the power spectrum is amplified by a factor @xmath57 over its real - space counterpart , p^s ( ) = ( 1+_^2)^2 p(k ) , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are redshift and real space power spectra , respectively , @xmath60 is the cosine of the angle between the wavevector @xmath61 and the line of sight @xmath62 , and @xmath11 is the linear redshift - space distortion parameter defined as ( a ) = ; @xmath12 is the linear bias , which we assume to be independent of scale .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys can be used to directly measure @xmath11 , and , if the bias is known , the growth rate of perturbations .",
    "in fact , the redshift space power spectrum can be decomposed into harmonics , whose relative amplitude depend on the growth rate of structure through @xmath11 .",
    "the possibility of using such dependence in order to constrain dark energy properties has been explored in @xcite ; here we focus on the measurements of the scale dependence of @xmath11 as a smoking gun of modified gravity .",

    "+ the linear bias for a population of large - scale structure tracers can be estimated by cross - correlating the line - of - sight projected density of the tracer with a convergence map reconstructed by cmb lensing techniques , and comparing the resulting signal with theory .",

    "we measure the cross - correlation spectrum : ^-= 32 bh_0 ^ 2 dp ( , ) where @xmath73 is the matter power spectrum at the comoving distance @xmath67 and we have related the wavenumber @xmath17 to the multipole @xmath74 via the limber approximation @xcite .",

    "the combined effect of smaller errors and of the asymptotic behavior of the growth factor , which induces a large deviation of @xmath92 from its gr value on small scales , is that redshift galaxy surveys are more sensitive to the small - scale modification of gravity than to the large - scale one .",

    "the matter clustering is enhanced on all scales with respect to the gr case , and the enhancement is largest on small scales .",
    "we concluded that the peculiar signatures of the @xmath10 theories will be definitely detectable with a survey like adept .",
    "+ more generally , any detection of deviation of @xmath85 from zero that was not due to some observational systematic would be a signature of truly novel physics with enhanced growth , pointing either to non - gr physics or to unexpected properties of dark energy : dark energy models with a non - zero sound speed are characterized by an oscillatory behavior of the growth @xcite , and scalar field dark energy suppresses growth on large scales @xcite .",
