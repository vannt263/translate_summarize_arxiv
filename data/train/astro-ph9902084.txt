    "the energy output of quasars and agn is comparable thoughout the far - ir to x - ray spectral regions , so studies of their emission mechanisms require observations throughout this range . prior to iso ,",
    "the far - ir continuum was observed by iras , providing our first look at quasars in this wavelength range and showing them to be strong emitters from 12100@xmath0 m .",
    "the poor spatial resolution and limited wavelength range of iras restricted observations to the ir - brightest subsets of quasars and agn and left open many questions as to the range of behavior present and the emission mechanisms responsible in the various types of agn . with iso",
    "we are now able to address some of these limitations by studying a large number of different kinds of agn and quasars .",
    "we observed 72 quasars and agn covering a full range of redshift and luminosity and many different types of seds .",
    "the observations were made with isophot ( @xcite ) and cover 5200@xmath0 m in 8 bands .",
    "the status of this project , including a description of the sample and global comparisons of our results with those of iras , is summarised elsewhere ( hooper , this volume ) .",
    "here we discuss our preliminary results in the context of the scientific questions we wish to address , with particular emphasis on the high - redshift objects in the sample .",
    "the data were processed with pia ( @xcite ) through the aap level , from which custom scripts ( originating with m. haas & s. mueller at mpia ) were used to determine source fluxes and uncertainties .",
    "default vignetting values from pia were applied to the chopped data , and the flux scale was set by fcs observations .",
    "sky noise estimates based on @xcite were included in the error budget . for further details of the data reduction",
    "please refer to hooper  ( this volume ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : seds ] shows typical examples of the seds of a radio - loud ( upper , rlq ) and radio - quiet ( lower , rqq ) quasar ( @xcite ) . throughout the far - ir  ultraviolet ( uv ) spectral region ,",
    "the seds are remarkably similar , showing the big blue bump in the optical - uv , the broad ir bump , and an inflection between the two centered at @xmath3@xmath0 m .",
    "the differences between the two radio classes are evident in the radio region where , by definition , the rlqs are several orders of magnitude more luminous , and in the soft x - ray region where the rlqs are a factor of @xmath4 brighter and have a harder spectrum .",
    "this latter difference is generally ascribed to an additional synchrotron self - compton component linked to the radio emission ( see  @xcite for a review of quasar seds ) .",
    "the radio  ir seds of core - dominated rlqs are generally smooth while in both rqqs and lobe - dominated rlqs the far - ir cutoff is steep and does not extrapolate into the radio .",
    "this difference has resulted in the general belief that the ir emission in core - dominated rlqs is dominated by beamed , non - thermal and in rqqs by thermal emission mechanisms ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the median rlq sed in figures  [ fig:1351],[fig:1202],[fig:1946 ] was generated from a combination of lobe- and core - dominated rlqs . in a unification scenario ( see  @xcite for a review ) the beamed ir component is expected to be weaker in lobe - dominated sources where the beam is in the plane of the sky . thus it may not be surprising that the rlq sed , formed by combining seds from the two radio subclasses , is similar to that of the rqqs .",
    "a detailed comparison of the seds of core- and lobe - dominated rlqs is required to confirm this scenario .",
    "such a transition from non - thermal to thermal emission with decreasing core - dominance is demonstrated in the preliminary isophot results of the european core program on quasars ( @xcite ; see also this volume ) .",
    "the main questions we wish to address with our iso sample are ( i ) to better understand the interplay between thermal and non - thermal emission in the various types of source ( ii ) to investigate the relative contributions of cool ( galactic / starburst ) and warm ( agn - related ) dust ( iii ) to characterize and measure the continua in order to constrain models ( iv ) to study the evolution of the ir seds .",
    "-0.2 in    -1.2 in    -1.0 in      figure  [ fig:1351 ] shows the rest - frame sed of a low - redshift ( z=0.088 ) , rqq pg1351 + 640 .",
    "the iso data points are shown as open triangles and the remainder of the multi - wavelength data are from  @xcite .",
    "this sed is typical of the low - redshift rqqs in our sample and compares well with the low - redshift median .",
    "the current limit on the far - ir turnover is @xmath5 , too steep to be due to non - thermal synchrotron emission , for which @xmath6 is required and @xmath7 is more typical ( @xcite ) . we thus conclude that the far - ir emission in this quasars is dominated by thermal emission from dust .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     1 : luminosity over indicated bandpass , assuming @xmath8=50 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and @xmath10=0 ( erg s@xmath9 ) + 2 : probably a gravitationally lensed source ( @xcite )    the ir sed is smooth and indicates a wide and probably continuous range of temperatures : 40500k . in a purely thermal scenario",
    "this smooth continuum can be explained by a combination of cool host galaxy dust , warm ( @xmath11k ) starburst - related dust ( e.g.  @xcite ) and hot ( t@xmath12k ) agn - related dust ( e.g.  from a torus , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively the emission could originate in agn - related dust which is sufficiently optically thick and/or geometrically arranged ( e.g.  the warped disk model of @xcite or a patchy torus ) to produce comparable emission over the wide range of observed temperatures .",
    "this latter scenario is supported by the results of van bemmel & barthel ( this volume ) which demonstrate that rlqs have significantly brighter far - ir emission than radio galaxies in samples which were matched so that the only difference should be one of orientation .",
    "we also note that , with these data alone , we can not rule out a significant contribution from a non - thermal component in the mid- and near - ir .",
    "-0.2 in    -1.2 in    -1.1 in    our sample includes 9 quasars with redshift @xmath13 . the 7 for which we have reliable iso detections",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : lum ] along with their redshifts , preliminary estimates of several broad - band ir luminosities and the number of iso detections used in this determination .",
    "the luminosities were determined via linear interpolation between the data points and are not tabulated where there were insufficient data to provide useful constraints .",
    "the ir - band luminosities , determined assuming @xmath8=50 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and @xmath10=0 , are high , ranging from 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the low - redshift rqq , pg1351 + 640 ( table  [ tab : lum ] ) has luminosities @xmath16 erg s@xmath9 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the rest - frame , radio  uv sed of br 1202@xmath180727 , the object with the highest luminosity , l(2200@xmath0 m ) @xmath19 erg s@xmath9 , is displayed in figure  [ fig:1202 ] .",
    "our iso fluxes and upper limits are shown as open triangles and our ground - based near - ir photometry , obtained at the steward observatory 61@xmath20 telescope in march 1996 , as open squares .",
    "multiwavelength data are from  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the median , low - redshift , rqq sed ( @xcite ) , normalised at @xmath21@xmath0 m , is superposed for comparison .",
    "relative to the rest - frame optical emission , the ir emission in this object is @xmath21 orders of magnitude stronger than is typical .",
    "this is a complex source .",
    "it is a luminous ( dust @xmath22 , @xcite ) , double ( @xcite ) , co source with a ly@xmath23 emission line companion ( @xcite ) . given its unprecendentedly strong mm and ir luminosities and double nature it seems highly likely that the source is graviationally lensed and so amplified by @xmath24 .",
    "however lensing can not explain the unusual sed of br 1202 - 0727 , since partial lensing would boost the smaller , optical / uv source rather than the probably extended ir emitting region .",
    "two extreme temperature grey - body curves ( assuming an emissivity index , @xmath25 ) are also superposed in figure  [ fig:1202 ] ( upper ) for illustration . again",
    "a wide range of temperature is present , @xmath26k although the upper limits in the mid - ir prevent any constraint on the emission at intermediate temperatures in this source . in figure  [ fig:1202 ] ( lower )",
    "an sed representing a ulirg with the maximum h - band host galaxy luminosity based on low redshift quasars ( @xcite ) is superposed .",
    "this comparison illustrates that the far - ir emission is comparable or in excess of that expected from a ulirg and far exceeds that expected from the host galaxy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the rest - frame , radio  uv sed of hs 1946 + 7658 is displayed in figure  [ fig:1946 ] .",
    "our iso fluxes and upper limits are shown as open triangles and the remainder of the multiwavelength data were taken from  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we also superpose grey - body curves ( assuming dust with emissivity index , @xmath25 ) at two extreme temperatures to illustrate the range of temperature present in the data .",
    "the sed of hs 1946 + 7658 is remarkably similar to the low redshift , rqq median , extending the conclusion of  @xcite based on the optical sed for this source . as with the low redshift rqq pg1351 + 640",
    ", the ir continuum appears smooth . in a pure thermal scenario , this suggests the presence of dust covering a continuous range from @xmath27k rather than two distinct low and high temperature components .",
    "the low temperature limit is determined by the longest wavelength at which we have data rather than a real cut - off in the source .",
    "-0.2 in    -1.1 in    in summary , the broad - band ir luminosities , ranging from 10@xmath28 erg s@xmath9 ( @xmath29 , assuming br 1202 - 0727 is lensed ) , are @xmath21 orders of magnitude higher than those of ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) whose seds peak in the ir with luminosities @xmath30 ( e.g.@xcite ) , even allowing for the different assumed hubble constant ( @xcite use @xmath31 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) . in the far - ir",
    "these luminosities are too high to be due to the host galaxy . as for the low redshift sources ( [ sec:1351 ] ) , the inferred temperature ranges are generally too broad to be fit by standard , agn molecular torus models ( @xcite ) , which can reproduce the higher temperature emission .",
    "thus more complex models or a strong starburst component are required to provide the lower temperature emission .",
    "we wish to thank the staff at the isophot data center in heidelberg , in particular martin haas , for their help and hospitality while working on these data .",
    "we also thank the iso staff at ipac for their continual support and help both during visits and remotely .",
