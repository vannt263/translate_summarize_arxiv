    "the lattice dimensionality is a key parameter in materials science .",
    "one dimensional ( 1d ) systems with half filled band undergo a structural distortion @xcite which increases the elastic energy and opens a gap at the fermi surface thus lowering the electronic energy .",
    "the competition between lattice and electronic subsystems stabilizes the 1d structure which accordingly acquires semiconducting properties whereas the behavior of the 3d system would be metallic like .",
    "conjugated polymers , take polyacetylene as prototype , show anisotropic electrical and optical properties @xcite due to intrinsic delocalization of @xmath2 electrons along the chain of ch units . as the intrachain bonding between adjacent ch monomers is much stronger than the interchain coupling the lattice is quasi-1d . hence , as a result of the peierls instability , polyacetylene shows an alternation of short and long neighboring carbon bonds , a dimerization , accompanied by a two fold degenerate ground state energy .",
    "the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model hamiltonian @xcite has become a successful tool in polymer physics as it hosts the peculiar ground state excitations of the 1d conjugated structure and it accounts for a broad range of polymer properties @xcite . as a fundamental feature of the ssh hamiltonian the electronic hopping integral linearly depends on the relative displacement between adjacent atomic sites thus leading to a nonlocal _ e - ph _ coupling with vertex function depending both on the electronic and the phononic wave vector .",
    "the latter property induces , in the matsubara formalism @xcite , an electron hopping associated with a time dependent lattice displacement . as a consequence time",
    "retarded electron - phonon interactions arise in the system yielding a source current which depends both on time and on the electron path coordinates .",
    "this causes large _ e - ph _ anharmonicities in the equilibrium thermodynamics of the ssh model @xcite .",
    "hopping of electrons from site to site accompanied by a coupling to the lattice vibration modes is a fundamental process @xcite determining the transport @xcite and equilibrium properties @xcite of many body systems .",
    "a variable range hopping may introduce some degree of disorder thus affecting the charge mobility @xcite and the thermodynamic functions .",
    "this paper focusses on this issue , dealing with the thermodynamical properties of the ssh model in two dimensions and comparing them with the results obtained in one dimension @xcite .",
    "only a few extensions of the ssh hamiltonian to higher dimensionality appear in the literature @xcite mainly concerning the phase diagrams @xcite and the ground state excitations @xcite .",
    "we apply a path integral method @xcite which fully accounts for the time retarded _ e - ph _ interactions and , exploiting the above mentioned hamiltonian linear dependence on the atomic displacement , allows us to derive the electron - phonon source action in two dimensions .",
    "the general formalism is outlined in section ii while the results are reported on in section iii .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "in a square lattice with isotropic nearest neighbors hopping integral @xmath3 , the ssh hamiltonian for electrons plus _ e - ph _ interactions reads :    @xmath4 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "( j_{r , s})_x=\\ , & & - { 1 \\over 2}\\bigl [ j - \\alpha \\delta u_x \\bigr ] \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ ( j_{r , s})_y=\\ , & & - { 1 \\over 2}\\bigl [ j - \\alpha \\delta u_y \\bigr ] \\ , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\delta u_y=\\ , & & u_y(r , s+1 ) - { u_{y}(r , s ) } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the electron - phonon coupling , @xmath6 is the dimerization coordinate indicating the displacement of the monomer group on the @xmath7 lattice site , @xmath8 and @xmath9 create and destroy electrons ( i.e. , @xmath2 band electrons in polyacetylene ) .",
    "the phonon hamiltonian is given by a set of 2d classical harmonic oscillators .",
    "the two addenda in ( 1 ) deal with one dimensional _",
    "e - ph _ couplings along the _ x _ and _ y _ axis respectively , with first neighbors electron hopping .",
    "second neighbors hopping processes ( with overlap integral @xmath10 ) may be accounted for by adding to the hamiltonian the term @xmath11 such that    @xmath12 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the real space hamiltonian in ( 1 ) can be transformed into a time dependent hamiltonian @xcite by introducing the electron coordinates : i ) @xmath13 at the @xmath14 lattice site ,",
    "ii ) @xmath15 at the @xmath16 lattice site and iii ) @xmath17 at the @xmath18 lattice site , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 vary on the scale of the inverse temperature @xmath21 .",
    "the spatial _ e - ph _ correlations contained in ( 1 ) are mapped onto the time axis by changing : @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . now we set @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , ( 1 ) transforms into the time dependent hamiltonian :    @xmath28 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "j_{y}(\\tau)&=&\\,- { 1 \\over 2}\\bigl[j - \\alpha u_{y}(\\tau ) \\bigr ] \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while the ground state of the 1d ssh hamiltonian is twofold degenerate , the degree of phase degeneracy is believed to be much higher in 2d @xcite as many lattice distortion modes contribute to open the gap at the fermi surface .",
    "nonetheless , as in 1d , these phases are connected by localized and nonlinear excitations , the soliton solutions .",
    "thus , also in 2d both electron hopping between solitons @xcite and thermal excitation of electrons to band states may take place within the model .",
    "these features are accounted for by the time dependent version of the hamiltonian .",
    "as @xmath19 varies continuously on the @xmath21 scale and the @xmath19-dependent displacement fields are continuous variables ( whose amplitudes are in principle unbound in the path integral ) , long range hopping processes are automatically included in @xmath29 which is therefore more general than the real space ssh hamiltonian in ( 1 ) ( and ( 2 ) ) .",
    "thus by means of the path integral formalism we look at the low temperature thermodynamical behavior both in 1d and 2d searching for those features which may be ascribable to some local disorder related to the variable range of the hopping processes .",
    "the semiclassical nature of the model is evident from ( 3 ) in which quantum mechanical degrees of freedom interact with the classical variables @xmath30 . averaging the electron operators over the ground state we obtain the time dependent semiclassical energy per lattice site @xmath31 :    @xmath32 \\cosh(\\epsilon_{\\bf k } \\tau ) n_f(\\epsilon_{\\bf k } )   \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the first and second addendum respectively .",
    "@xmath35 is the electron dispersion relation and @xmath36 is the fermi function .",
    "eq.(4 ) can be rewritten in a way suitable to the path integral approach by defining    @xmath37    @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the effective terms accounting for the @xmath19 dependent electronic hopping while @xmath40 is interpreted as the external source @xcite current for the oscillator field @xmath41 .",
    "averaging the electrons over the ground state we neglect the fermion - fermion correlations @xcite .",
    "this approximation however is not expected to affect substantially the following calculations . taking a bath of @xmath42 2d oscillators , we generally write the ssh electron path integral , @xmath43 , as :    @xmath44 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cdot & exp\\biggl[- \\int_0^{\\beta}d\\tau \\biggl({m \\over 2 } \\dot{\\bf \\zeta}^2(\\tau ) + v\\bigl({x}(\\tau)\\bigr ) + v\\bigl({y}(\\tau)\\bigr ) \\biggr)\\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{i=1}^{\\bar n } { \\bf u}_i(\\tau ) \\cdot { \\bf j}({\\bf v}(\\tau ) ) \\biggr ] \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the electron mass , @xmath46 is the atomic mass and @xmath47 is the oscillator frequency . as a main feature we notice that the interacting energy is linear in the atomic displacement field .",
    "then , the electronic path integral can be derived after integrating out the oscillator degrees of freedom which are decoupled along the @xmath48 and @xmath49 axis .",
    "thus , we get :    @xmath50 \\biggr]^2 , \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & a ( { x}(\\tau))=\\ , -{{\\hbar^2 } \\over { 4m}}\\sum_{i=1}^{\\bar n } { 1 \\over { \\hbar \\omega_i \\sinh(\\hbar\\omega_i\\beta/2 ) } } \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cdot & \\int_0^{\\beta } d\\tau j({x}(\\tau ) ) \\int_0^{\\beta}d{\\tau '' } \\cosh\\bigl(\\hbar\\omega_i \\bigl ( |\\tau - { \\tau''}| - \\beta/2 \\bigr ) \\bigr ) j({x}({\\tau '' } ) ) , \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & z_i=\\ , \\bigl [ { 1 \\over { 2\\sinh(\\hbar\\omega_i\\beta/2 ) } } \\bigr]^2 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the 2d electron path integral is obtained after squaring the sum over one dimensional electron paths .",
    "this permits to reduce the computational problem which is nonetheless highly time consuming particularly in the low temperature limit .",
    "note infact that the source current @xmath51 requires integration over the 2d brillouin zone ( bz ) according to ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and this occurs for any choice of the electron path coordinates .",
    "the quadratic ( in the coupling @xmath5 ) source action @xmath52 is time retarded as the particle moving through the lattice drags the excitations of the oscillator fields which take a time to readjust to the electron motion . when the interaction is sufficiently strong the conditions for polaron formation @xcite may be fulfilled in the system according to the degree of adiabaticity @xcite .",
    "however the present path integral description is valid independently of the existence of polarons as it applies also to the weak coupling regime .",
    "assuming periodic conditions @xmath53 , the particle paths can be expanded in fourier components    @xmath54    and the open ends integral over the paths @xmath55 transforms into the measure of integration @xmath56 . taking :    @xmath57\\ ] ]    which normalizes the kinetic energy term in ( 7 ) , we proceed to integrate ( 7 ) in order to derive the full partition function of the system versus temperature .",
    "taking a dimensionless path ( in units of the lattice constant @xmath58 ) with : @xmath59 and @xmath60 the functional measure in ( 9 ) can be rewritten as :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the cutoff on the fourier components in ( 8) . at a given temperature and for a given set of particle path coefficients we first carry out the momentum integrations required by ( 4 ) summing over 1600 points in the reduced 2d bz .",
    "this prepares the source current @xmath51 to be used in the double time integration which yields , according to ( 7 ) , the source action @xmath52 .",
    "afterwards we sum the exponential of the total action over an appropriate set of particle paths .",
    "numerically stable results are achieved by tuning the number of pairs @xmath62 in ( 10 ) , the cutoff ( @xmath63 ) on the integration range of the fourier coefficients in ( 10 ) and the related number of points ( @xmath64 ) in the measure of integration .",
    "@xmath65 suffices in the fourier expansion of the path .",
    "the argument to set the cutoff @xmath63 on the integration range is based on the fact that the functional measure normalizes the kinetic term in ( 7 ) :    @xmath66 = \\,1\\ ] ]    from ( 11 ) we get , @xmath67 hence , @xmath63 scales versus temperature as @xmath68 .",
    "computing ( 7 ) with ( 10 ) we find that infact a smaller cutoff , @xmath69 , guarantees convergence in the interacting partition function . accordingly",
    "the number of points in each integration range has to increase by decreasing @xmath0 as @xmath70 . in the 2d problem",
    ", @xmath71 points for each fourier coefficient are required in ( 10 ) .",
    "then we carry out the total 2d path integral by evaluating the contribution of @xmath72 paths selecting the integer part of @xmath64 at any temperature .",
    "computation of the second order derivatives of the free energy in the range @xmath73k$ ] , with a spacing of 3k , takes 55hours and 15 minutes on a pentium 4 .",
    "the physical input parameters characterizing both the 1d and 2d models are : the bare hopping integral @xmath3 , the oscillator frequencies @xmath47 and the effective coupling @xmath74 ( in units @xmath75 ) .",
    "we take here a narrow band system with @xmath76 .",
    "the crossover between weak and strong _ e - ph _ coupling is given in our model by @xmath77 @xcite , where @xmath78 is the largest energy in the oscillators bath .",
    "let s assume a bath of @xmath79 low energy oscillators with @xmath80 thus setting the crossover value at @xmath81",
    ". a higher number of oscillators in the same energy range would not significantly modify the results hereafter presented whereas lower @xmath47 values would yield a larger contribution to the phonon partition function mainly at low @xmath0 . in fig.1 ,",
    "a comparison between the 1d and the 2d free energies is presented for two values of @xmath82 , one lying in the weak and one in the strong _ e - ph _ coupling regime .",
    "the oscillator free energies @xmath83 are plotted separately while the free energies arising from the total action in ( 7 ) , shortly termed @xmath84 , are due to the purely electronic plus _ e - ph _ contributions . in general , the 2d free energies have a larger gradient ( versus temperature ) than the corresponding 1d terms .",
    "the @xmath83 lie above the @xmath84 both in 1d and 2d because of the choice of the @xmath85 ; lowering the energy of some oscillator modes would produce a crossing point between @xmath83 and @xmath84 with temperature location depending on the value of @xmath82 .",
    "note that the @xmath84 plots have a positive temperature derivative in the low temperature regime and this feature is more pronounced in 2d .",
    "infact , at low @xmath0 , the source action is dominated by the hopping potential @xmath86 while , at increasing @xmath0 , the _ e - ph _ effects become progressively more important ( as the bifurcation between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 curves shows ) and the @xmath84 get a negative derivative . in 2d ,",
    "the weight of the @xmath86 term is larger because there is a higher hopping probability .",
    "this physical expectation is taken into account by the path integral method . at any temperature",
    ", we monitor the ensamble of relevant particle paths over which the hopping potential is evaluated . for a selected set of fourier components in ( 10 )",
    "the hopping decreases by lowering @xmath0 but its value is still significant at low @xmath0 .",
    "considered that : i ) the total action is obtained after a @xmath89 integration of @xmath86 and ii ) the @xmath89 integration range is larger at lower temperatures , we explain why the overall hopping potential contribution to the total action is responsible for the anomalous free energy behavior at low t.    in fig.2 , the heat capacity contributions due to the oscillators ( @xmath90 ) and electrons plus _ e - ph _ coupling ( @xmath91 ) are reported on .",
    "the values are normalized over @xmath42 .",
    "the dimensionality effects are seen to be large and , for a given dimensionality , the role of the _ e - ph _ interactions is magnified at increasing @xmath0 . the total heat capacity ( @xmath90 + @xmath91 ) over @xmath0 ratios are plotted in fig.3 in the low @xmath0 regime to emphasize the presence of an anomalous upturn which appears at @xmath92 in 1d and @xmath93 in 2d .",
    "this feature in the heat capacity linear coefficient is ultimately related to the above discussed overall hopping potential effects while the strength of the coupling @xmath82 has a minor role in the low @xmath0 limit .",
    "finally we emphasize that the degeneracy of the ground state scarcely affects the finite temperature equilibrium properties .",
    "this can be shown in 1d by treating the ssh hamiltonian in mean field approximation with a staggered dimerization amplitude which yields the size of the lattice distortion . by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in momentum space",
    "we see that the competition between electron and lattice energy determines the contribution to the partition function and shifts downwards the free energy versus temperature .",
    "hence , the heat capacity due to the degeneracy is very small ( in comparison with the values given in fig.2 ) and strictly linear in @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , the peculiar and sizeable upturn in the heat capacity over t ratio does not depend on the nature of the ground state .",
    "the inclusion of the quantum lattice fluctuations beyond the mean field approximation is expected to reinforce our conclusion as the fluctuations tend to suppress the long range order associated with the dimerized structure @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the thermodynamics of a semiclassical su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian extended to two dimensions in which the lattice displacements are taken as classical variables . by mapping the real space interactions onto the time ( @xmath19 ) scale we deal with an hamiltonian accounting for a variable range of the electronic transfer integral .",
    "such a model can be suitably treated in the path integral formalism as both the electron and lattice degrees of freedom are continuous functions of @xmath19 which varies up to the inverse temperature .",
    "although we are thus assuming a continuum model the present path integral calculation is valid for any range of _ e - ph _ coupling and for any value of physical parameters .    the two dimensional path integral for the ssh particle in a bath of harmonic oscillators has been derived by summing over a set of electron paths that becomes increasingly large at decreasing temperatures .",
    "thus , the computation of the total action and of the free energy derivatives is highly time consuming in the low @xmath0 regime where the quantum mechanical nature of the electronic subsystem is fully accounted for . at low @xmath0",
    ", the electron hopping integral largely shapes the free energy which displays an anomalous positive derivative more pronounced in 2d than in 1d .",
    "this behavior is mirrored in the upturn of the _ heat capacity over t _ ratio . for a given set of input parameters characterizing electron band , oscillator energies and _ e - ph _ couplings , we find that the upturn shows up at @xmath93 in the square lattice and at @xmath92 in the linear chain",
    ". also the size of the upturn is larger in two dimensions consistently with the fact that the 2d hopping potential contribution to the total action is higher than in 1d .",
    "the presented results have been obtained assuming a narrow electron band ( @xmath94 ) but the upturn in the _ heat capacity over t _",
    "ratio appears also in the case of wide band systems .",
    "the degenerate ground state of the ssh model is not responsible for the anomalous behavior of the heat capacity over @xmath0 ratio .",
    "infact , closing the linear chain in a ring geometry , one can easily diagonalize the 1d hamiltonian in mean field approximation and show that the contribution to the total heat capacity , due to the two fold degeneracy of the ground state , is small and linear versus temperature . a quantum description of the lattice displacement fields should further reduce the role of the dimerized ground state as the fluctuations tend to suppress the order parameter .",
    "similar conclusions are expected to hold in the 2d case where , however , the degeneracy of the ground state is manyfold .    in conclusion , while in the low @xmath0 regime the thermodynamics is essentially governed by the electronic term of the hamiltonian , at increasing @xmath0 the strength of _ e - ph _ coupling progressively determines the slope of the free energy and heat capacity .",
    "our results suggest that a glassy like thermodynamical behavior is a peculiar feature of hamiltonian models with a variable range for the electronic hopping . such a behavior is more likely to occur in higher dimensionality as the structure is more closely packed and , accordingly , the hopping probability is larger .",
