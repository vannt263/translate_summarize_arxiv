    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the strong interactions between quarks and gluons at small distances very well , where the strong coupling constant @xmath1 is small and the calculation becomes perturbative .",
    "however , the calculation of total cross sections , usually dominated by long range forces or `` soft interactions '' , needs more understanding .",
    "a fraction of these interactions are characterized by the exchange of a color singlet with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "these `` diffractive '' interactions are well described by regge theory , where a leading ( `` pomeron '' ) trajectory with vacuum quantum numbers is exchanged in the @xmath2-channel .",
    "[ t ]    figure  [ melzer : fig1 ] shows a sketch of the generic diffractive process in @xmath0 scattering at hera , displaying the most important variables .",
    "the hard scale of the interaction is given by the photon virtuality @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the @xmath5 centre of mass energy , and @xmath2 the squared four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , where the proton has the four - momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the colorless diffractive object ( @xmath7 ) carries the momentum fraction @xmath8 , and the quark struck by the photon with four - momentum @xmath9 has the fraction @xmath10 of the momentum of the diffractive exchange .",
    "they are defined as follows : @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the bjorken-@xmath12 .",
    "the diffractively produced system @xmath13 has the mass @xmath14 .",
    "the proton can stay intact and get scattered with the four - momentum @xmath15 or dissociate in a system @xmath16 with mass @xmath17 .",
    "there are different methods to select diffractive events .",
    "a very clean way is to detect the scattered proton in the forward direction . h1 and zeus have proton spectrometers placed along the beam line in the direction of the proton beam .",
    "in addition to being free from proton dissociation background , the advantage of this selection is the possibility to measure the momentum transfer @xmath2 . on the other hand , this method is limited by statistics due to small acceptance .    a high statistics sample can be obtained taking advantage of the characteristic properties of the final state , where we observe a large gap in rapidity between the leading proton ( or in case of dissociation the leading baryonic system ) and the photon dissociation system due to the colorless exchange .",
    "this gap can be identified by the abscence of activity in the forward part of the calorimeter .",
    "the residual proton dissociation background is about 9% for masses",
    "@xmath18 gev and can be subtracted statistically .",
    "the third method to extract diffractive is using the fact that the @xmath14 distributions behave differently for diffractive and non - diffractive data .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the diffractive contribution is almost flat in @xmath19 while the non - diffractive contribution is exponentially falling for decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "the diffractive data is extracted with a fit of the variable @xmath19 .",
    "the proton dissociation background gets subtracted for masses of @xmath20 gev @xcite .",
    "the differential diffractive cross section @xmath21 can be defined @xmath22 with the reduced cross section @xmath23 , which is related to the diffractive structure functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , neglecting contributions from the @xmath26 exchange , by    @xmath27    [ b ]    [ melzer : fig4 ]    assuming regge factorisation , qcd fits have been performed by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite , using the dglap formalism to evolve the non - perturbative diffractive parton densities ( dpdfs ) .",
    "the diffractive exchange is modeled in terms of a light flavor singlet and a gluon distribution , parameterized by a set of polynomials at a starting scale @xmath28 gev@xmath29 in case of h1 .",
    "zeus includes also diffractive charm data in the fit , starting at @xmath30 gev@xmath29 .",
    "h1 treats the charm quark in the massive scheme via boson - gluon fusion processes with @xmath31 gev , while zeus uses the thorne - roberts variable flavor number ( trvfn ) scheme with @xmath32 gev .",
    "both experiments find a large momentum fraction exchanged by gluons of @xmath33 % ( h1 ) and @xmath34 % ( zeus ) at the initial scale .",

    "[ melzer : fig4 ] shows the diffractive pdfs from h1 .    using these pdfs",
    ", one can perform tests of the validity of the assumptions made for the qcd analysis , primarily the qcd factorisation .",
    "since the pdfs are gluon dominated , there is a special interest in processes which are sensitive to photon - gluon interactions , like dijet and heavy flavor processes .",
    "the longitudinal fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the emitted gluon @xmath35 is determined using the invariant mass @xmath36 of the @xmath37 system .",
    "figure  [ melzer : fig5 ] shows the measured dijet cross section as a function of @xmath35 from h1 @xcite , compared to the disent nlo calculation @xcite interfaced to the h1 pdfs shown above .",
    "the error band of the nlo calculation is estimated varying the renormalisation scale by factors 0.5 and 2 .",
    "also shown is the rapgap @xcite prediction , which contains parton showers and is based on the lo pdfs from the same fit .",
    "zeus has done a similar measurement @xcite , comparing the data to nlo qcd calculations with the h1 pdfs and the zeus pdfs from the measurements shown above .",
    "these describe the data well , while a third nlo calculation using the glp fit @xcite underestimates the data .",
    "[ b ]    both zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite have measured diffractive @xmath38 production in dis .",

    "[ melzer : fig6 ] , compared to an nlo calculation using a diffractive version of the program hvqdis @xcite .",
    "the inner error band represents the renormalization scale uncertainty varied by factors 1/4 to 4 , while the outer error band shows the total uncertainty , including variations of the charm mass from 1.35 to 1.65 gev and of the parameter of the peterson fragmentation function @xmath40 from 0.035 to 0.100 , added in quadrature .",
    "both , the dijet as well as the @xmath38 production in dis are reasonably well described by the nlo calculations using the h1 pdfs , supporting the assumption that factorisation holds for diffractive reactions in dis .",
    "[ b ]    applying a similar qcd calculation to diffractive dijet production at tevatron , the observed rate is overestimated by a factor of 3 to 10 , depending on the chosen diffractive pdf @xcite .",
    "this factorisation breaking is explained by kaidalov et al .",
    "@xcite as being caused by secondary interactions of additional spectator quarks in the proton remnant , which are not present in virtual photons ( in dis ) . in photoproduction",
    "though , the photon can either participate directly in the hard scattering subprocess ( `` direct photon '' ) , or fluctuate into partons ( `` resolved photon '' ) . in this case",
    "only a part @xmath41 of the photon momentum enters the hard scattering .",
    "this resolved photon part is similar to hadron - hadron scattering and should therefore be suppressed , as seen at tevatron .",
    "kaidalov et al .",
    "@xcite have predicted a suppression factor of 0.34 for the resolved photon contribution in diffractive dijet photoproduction .",
    "h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite have measured diffractive dijets in photoproduction and compared the result to nlo qcd calculations .",
    "figure  [ melzer : fig7 ] shows the cross section and the ratio of the cross section over the nlo prediction as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "although the shape is described by the nlo calculation quite well , the cross section is overestimated in all bins . scaling the resolved part by the factor",
    "0.34 does not describe the shape .",
    "this suggests that a global suppression is more likely than a resolved photon suppression only .",
    "zeus has recently measured diffractive @xmath38 in photoproduction @xcite .",
    "figure  [ melzer : fig8 ] shows the cross section in bins of @xmath14 and @xmath4 in comparison to nlo calculations using the fmnr @xcite program with the h1 pdfs shown above .",
    "the error band includes , in addition to the variation of the charm mass ( @xmath43 gev ) , variations of the fragmentation and renormalisation scale by factors 0.5 and 2 .",
    "the data are both in shape and in the total normalisation well described .",
    "[ t ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     this is not necessarily a contradiction to the dijet results , taking into account that the inclusive @xmath38 in photoproduction cross section is underestimated in the nlo calculations @xcite by approximately the same amount the diffractive dijet cross section is overestimated .",
    "the nlo calculations for the inclusive dijets in photoproduction @xcite describe the data well in shape and magnitude .",
    "diffractive exchange contributes a substantial part to the deep - inelastic @xmath0 scattering at hera .",
    "assuming regge factorisation , the nature of the diffractive exchange can be studied with qcd fits to inclusive diffractive data .",
    "these fits show that diffractive exchange is dominated by gluons , contributing about 75 % of the exchanged momentum .",
    "using the pdfs obtained from the h1 and zeus qcd fits shown above , the factorisation assumption is successfully tested for the diffractive production of dijets and heavy flavor in dis . using the glp pdfs ,",
    "the data are underestimated , leading to the conclusion that the pdfs probably have a large uncertainty . applying a similar qcd calculation to diffractive dijet production at tevatron ,",
    "the observed rate is overestimated , which is explained by secondary interactions of spectator partons in hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "this suppression should also be visible in photoproduction at hera , in part of the reactions where the photon is resolved , but there is no clear picture yet .",
    "the diffractive dijets in photoproduction not only a suppression of the resolved part , but an overall suppression of the order of 0.5 .",
    "the diffractive @xmath38 data seem to be described by the nlo calculations , but as the inclusive @xmath38 in photoproduction is underestimated by similar nlo calculations , one has to be careful with the interpretation of this result .",
