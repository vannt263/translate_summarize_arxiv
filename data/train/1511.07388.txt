    "the superconducting spintronics now is a very active field of research .",
    "it is based on the recent progress in realization of superconductor / ferromagnet heterostructures .",
    "one direction of the research activity has been focused on the study of proximity induced triplet superconducting correlations in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the other direction is to study spin - polarized quasiparticle transport and spin accumulation in superconducting wires @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is very important to transmit spin signals over mesoscopic length scales .",
    "usually spin signals are created by injection of spin - polarized quasiparticles into normal or superconducting wire from ferromagnetic leads .",
    "it was shown in transport experiments @xcite that for al thin films in the normal state the spin relaxation length @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath1 nm . it was also measured that the spin relaxation length is reduced upon al transition into the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "however , it was demonstrated recently that in zeeman - split superconducting films the spin signals can be created by injection of unpolarized electrons .",
    "such spin signals can spread over distances of several @xmath2 m @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the spin relaxation length exceeds considerably the superconducting coherence length , the normal - state spin relaxation length and the charge - imbalance length .",
    "moreover , the decay length of the spin signal grows with the applied magnetic field , while the charge - imbalance relaxation length only reduces .",
    "the origin of such long - range spin signals has been addressed by several theoretical groups recently .",
    "it is known that in the absence of the magnetic or the exchange field ( zeeman splitting of the dos ) and at low temperatures the main mechanisms of the spin relaxation in superconductors are elastic spin flips by magnetic impurities and by spin - orbit interaction @xcite . in order to these mechanisms of spin relaxation",
    "can work there should be a difference between distribution functions for quasiparticles with opposite spins .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for realistic parameters of the films the relaxation length provided by these mechanisms in the zeeman - split superconducting state does not exceed the normal state relaxation length , which is of the order of @xmath1 nm in the experimentally investigated films .",
    "so , it is unlikely that the experimentally observed long - distance spin relaxation is provided by such elastic spin - flip processes .    instead , it was proposed @xcite that for the observed spin signal a difference between distribution functions for quasiparticles with opposite spins is absent .",
    "but the quasiparticle current injected into the superconductor is accompanied by the energy flow that creates a nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution in it .",
    "the role of elastic spin - flip processes is only to rapidly relax the distribution function to the spin - independent value .",
    "the observed spin signal is formed by this spin - independent nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution weighted by the spin - split dos .",
    "the relaxation length of such a spin signal is the energy relaxation length .    in the framework of this mechanism the shape of the spin signal",
    "is well reproduced @xcite .",
    "however , there is no full and detailed theoretical investigation of the long - range spin signal relaxation so far . in refs .  [ ] and [ ] the relaxation length was considered as a phenomenological parameter , in ref .",
    "[ ] the renormalization of the energy relaxation time due to superconductivity was not taken into account and the overheating of the electron subsystem was neglected .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a theory of spin relaxation in zeeman - split superconducting films at low temperatures and focus on the relaxation mechanisms of the long - range spin signal .",
    "it has been reported in the literature @xcite that the energy relaxation provided by the electron - electron scattering in al at low temperatures is faster than the relaxation due to electron - phonon scattering . in this framework",
    "we show that the long - range spin signal can be naturally divided into two parts : due to nonthermalized quasiparticle distribution and due to thermalized overheated electron distribution .",
    "they can be distinguished by their different dependencies on the applied voltage .",
    "the decay length of the nonthermalized signal is determined by the electron - electron scattering rate , renormalized due to superconductivity .",
    "it depends crucially on the temperature of the overheated electron subsystem and superconducting gap .",
    "the decay length of the thermalized signal is determined by the length on which the injected energy leaves the electronic subsystem . in dependence on the particular sample design",
    "it can be determined by an electron - phonon relaxation length or the geometry , that is the distance between the injector and the heat reservoir .",
    "in realistic systems this length can be very large .",
    "applications of the theory to the recent experimental data @xcite on spin relaxation in zeeman - split and exchange - split superconductors are discussed . in particular",
    ", it can explain the extremely high spin relaxation lengths , experimentally observed in zeeman - split superconductors , their growth with the magnetic field and with the applied voltage .",
    "it also reproduces the characteristic two - peak shape of the signal , measured for the exchange - split samples @xcite .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "following the experiments @xcite we consider the system depicted in fig .  [ scheme ] .",
    "it consists of a thin superconducting film ( s ) overlapped by the injector ( i ) and detector ( d ) electrodes .",
    "the distance between them is @xmath3 .",
    "both the injector and the detector are coupled to the film by tunnel contacts .",
    "a current is injected into the superconducting film via i. this electrode can be normal or ferromagnetic .",
    "the detector electrode is ferromagnetic . in this case",
    "the spin imbalance in the superconductor can be converted into an electric current at the s / d interface . for the tunnel case , considered here",
    ", the current @xmath4 measured by the detector can be calculated as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total conductance of the s / d interface and @xmath7 is its polarization .",
    "@xmath2 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ i d ] ) is the shift of quasiparticle chemical potential , determined by the charge imbalance , and the second term in the brackets is proportional to the local nonequilibrium spin accumulation @xmath8 in the film at the detector point .",
    "further we are interested in large enough @xmath3 , where the charge imbalance has already relaxed : @xmath9 .",
    "so , we assume that the electric current at the detector point is proportional to @xmath8 and focus on this quantity . in the real experimental situation",
    "the charge imbalance indeed relaxes much more rapidly than the spin imbalance @xcite .",
    "physically , the main source of the low - temperature charge imbalance relaxation is the orbital effect of the applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is applied in plane of the film and is parallel to the ferromagnetic wires . in our study",
    "the quantization axis is chosen along the magnetic field .",
    "now we discuss the qualitative physics lying behind these measurements . as it was already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it is desirable to make the spin relaxation length as large as possible . in the absence of the magnetic or the exchange field ( zeeman splitting of the dos ) and at low temperatures the main mechanisms of the spin relaxation in superconductors are elastic spin flips by magnetic impurities and by spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "the resulting relaxation length is not large : of the order of a few hundreds nanometers for al .",
    "it was also shown experimentally and theoretically that it can be only reduced upon transition into the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "all the discussed above spin imbalance is caused by the difference in the distribution functions for spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "therefore , the length of the corresponding spin relaxation is controlled by the length at which this difference disappears . at first glance",
    ", one can think that the zeeman splitting of the superconducting dos can greatly enhance the spin relaxation length .",
    "the idea is that in the energy window of the zeeman splitting elastic spin flips can not relax the nonequilibrium spin distribution function .",
    "this is because the processes are blocked by the absence of available dos in one of spin subbands [ see fig .",
    "[ blocking](a ) ] .",
    "however , it was obtained @xcite that this mechanism does not work ( at least for real values of elastic scattering rates ) .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the true energy gap is from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and is the same for the both spin subbands , where @xmath12 is the superconducting order parameter in the film and @xmath13 is the zeeman field .",
    "there are no true energy gap in the energy window of the zeeman splitting . due to nonzero elastic scattering rates",
    "the dos is redistributed between the spin subbands there [ see fig .",
    "[ blocking](b ) ] .",
    "consequently , the elastic flips in the energy window of the zeeman splitting are not blocked and the fast elastic spin - flip processes cancel the difference between spin - up and spin - down distributions in this energy window , as it is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ blocking](c ) . as a result , the injected spin imbalance ( we mean here the difference between the spin up and spin down distribution functions ) relaxes in the zeeman - split superconductor even faster than in the normal metal @xcite .                but inspecting fig",
    ".  [ blocking](c ) one can suspect that the spin signal is still present in the superconductor in spite of the zero difference between spin - up and spin - down distributions .",
    "this is due to the different dos in the spin subbands .",
    "indeed , the quasiparticle current injected into the superconductor is accompanied by the energy flow that creates a nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution in it , and the measured long - range spin signals were attributed to this spin - independent nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution weighted by the spin - split dos @xcite .",
    "such spin signals can be created even by normal ( instead of ferromagnetic ) injectors , as it was observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "for such a spin signal a difference between distribution functions for quasiparticles with opposite spins is absent .",
    "the relaxation length of such a spin signal is the energy relaxation length .",
    "the role of spin - flip processes is only to rapidly relax the distribution function to the spin - independent value .",
    "so , the origin of the measured signal the spin - independent difference between the distribution functions of electrons in the superconductor and in the detector .",
    "it simply can be converted into the spin signal by the spin - split dos even if the spin - split dos exists only near the detector .",
    "the long - range spin signal of the discussed type can be naturally divided into two parts according to the nature of this difference : due to nonthermalized quasiparticle distribution and due to thermalized overheated electron distribution .",
    "they can be distinguished by their different dependencies on the applied voltage .",
    "the first part of the signal is due to nonthermalized electrons .",
    "it is always present near the injector , where the injected high - energy electrons can not be described by the fermi distribution with a definite temperature .",
    "it is shown below that this part of the signal as a function of the injection voltage @xmath14 has typical one - peak shape , where the peak is located at @xmath15 .",
    "the main process providing thermalization is the electron - electron scattering .",
    "so , the decay length of this part of signal is determined by the electron - electron scattering rate , renormalized due to superconductivity .",
    "the second part of the signal is due to overheating of the injected electrons .",
    "it is determined by the difference between the effective electron temperature in the superconductor and in the detector .",
    "the typical shape of this signal is directly connected to the dependence of electron overheating temperature on the injection voltage : @xmath16 . in its turn",
    ", @xmath16 is determined by superconducting density of states .",
    "that is , it has two steps at @xmath17 .",
    "correspondingly , the measured nonlocal differential conductance @xmath18 manifests typical two - peak shape , where peaks are located at these voltages @xcite .",
    "the two peaks can be clearly observed in the signal if the coherent peaks in the superconducting dos are well pronounced .",
    "it is worth to note here that this contribution can be viewed as a kind of a thermoelectric effect .",
    "the other types of giant thermoelectric effect were also predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite for superconductor / ferromagnet heterostructures .",
    "the relaxation length of this thermalized contribution to the signal is controlled by the length , over which the effective electron temperature relaxes to its equilibrium value , that is the energy relaxation length . in dependence on the particular sample design",
    "it can be determined by the electron - phonon relaxation length or correspond to the distance between the injector and an equilibrium bulk reservoir .",
    "the latter case takes place if the heat leakage into the phonon subsystem can be neglected and the heat transport is controlled by the temperature gradient .",
    "below it is shown that this scenario is more relevant to the existing low - temperature experiments with superconducting al films .",
    "on the other hand , if one excludes the the heat leakage into the reservoir , the resulting relaxation length , controlled by the electron - phonon relaxation rate , can become very large .",
    "the total measured nonlocal conductance has contributions from the both types of signal .",
    "typically it manifests a pronounced peak at @xmath19 , provided by as thermalized , so as nonthermalized electrons .",
    "the second peak at @xmath20 is only provided by thermalized electrons .",
    "it can be absent if the coherent peaks in the superconducting dos are smeared enough by various depairing factors ( first of all , by the orbital effect of the applied field ) or if the electron overheating by the injected current is small , or if the detector is also overheated .",
    "it is also obvious that the peaks at @xmath19 and at @xmath20 should have different relaxation lengths .",
    "the former relaxes over the electron - electron relaxation length , while the relaxation of the latter is controlled by the length over which the electron subsystem is cooled .",
    "it has been reported in the literature @xcite that the relaxation provided by the electron - electron scattering in al at low temperatures is faster than the relaxation due to electron - phonon scattering . according to this reason in the present work we have clear hierarchy of length scales .",
    "the smallest length scales are the superconducting coherence length , elastic spin - flip length @xmath21 and charge relaxation length ( hundreds of nanometers ) .",
    "the larger scale is the electron - electron scattering length @xmath22 , renormalized due to superconductivity , applied magnetic field and electron overheating ( it is of the order of several microns ) . and the largest scale is the length @xmath23 over which the electron subsystem is cooled .                    the space evolution of the distribution function is schematically shown in fig",

    "the distribution of injected electrons is spin - split [ see fig .",
    "[ scales](a ) ] .",
    "also , it is nonthermalized . at distances @xmath24",
    "it becomes spin - independent , as it is shown in panel ( b ) of fig .",

    "now it is also symmetric over energy because the charge relaxation length has the same order .",
    "further , at distances @xmath25 the distribution is thermalized , as in fig .",

    "finally , the electrons are cooled at distances @xmath26 , as it is shown in panel ( d ) .    due to this hierarchy",

    "the reason for this decrease can be understood in the following way .",
    "when the effective electron temperature is smaller than the spectral gap , the number of equilibrium quasiparticles above the gap should be exponentially small .",
    "but , from the other hand , this number is controlled by injection .",
    "consequently , the resulting electron temperature is very sensitive to the gap value .",

    "for example , they both can lie on the shared heat - conducting substrate and have a good heat contact to it .    because @xmath213 has no one distinguished peak , it is not informative to calculate the peak area .",

    "the typical feature is that the relaxation length grows with voltage increase .",
    "the reason is the following . at rather small voltages",
    "less than @xmath12 the signal is dominated by the nonthermalized part , so the relaxation length is governed by the electron - electron relaxation . at larger voltages this part of the signal",

    "in conclusion , a theory of long - range spin transport and spin relaxation in zeeman - split superconducting films at low temperatures is developed .",
    "it is suggested that the main mechanism , which determines the relaxation length of a nonequilibrium spin signal in the zeeman - split superconductors is the spin - independent energy relaxation .    the spin signal measured by the detector can be divided into two physically different contributions .",
