    "in this section we summarize the method for computing word length of elements of @xmath0 with respect to the consecutive generating sets @xmath50 which was introduced in @xcite , and refer the reader to that paper for complete details .",
    "elements of @xmath0 can be viewed combinatorially as pairs of finite binary rooted trees , each with the same number of carets , called tree pair diagrams .",
    "we define a _",
    "caret _ to be a vertex of the tree together with two downward oriented edges , which we refer to as the left and right edges of the caret .",
    "the _ right ( respectively left ) child _ of a caret @xmath51 in a tree @xmath52 is defined to be a caret which is attached to the right ( resp .",
    "left ) edge of @xmath51 . if a caret @xmath51 does not have a right ( resp",
    ". left ) child , we call the right ( resp",
    ". left ) edge , or leaf , of @xmath51 _",
    "exposed_. define the _ level _ of a caret inductively as follows .",
    "the root caret is defined to be at level 1 , and the child of a level @xmath53 caret has level @xmath54 , for @xmath55 .",
    "we number the leaves of each tree from @xmath56 through @xmath8 , going from left to right , and number the carets in infix order from @xmath57 through @xmath8 .",
    "the infix ordering is carried out by numbering the left child of a caret @xmath51 before numbering @xmath51 , and the right child of @xmath51 afterwards .",
    "each element @xmath58 can be represented by an equivalence class of tree pair diagrams , among which there is a unique reduced tree pair diagram .",
    "we say that a pair of trees is _ unreduced _ if when the leaves are numbered from @xmath56 through @xmath8 , there is a caret in both trees with two exposed leaves bearing the same leaf numbers .",
    "we remove such pairs of carets , renumber the leaves and check this condition again , repeating until there are no more pairs of exposed carets with identical leaf numbers .",
    "this procedure produces the the unique _ reduced _ tree pair diagram representing @xmath59 . when we write @xmath60",
    ", we are assuming that this is the unique reduced tree pair diagram representing @xmath58 . in this case",
    ", we refer to @xmath52 as the _ negative _ tree in the pair and @xmath3 as the _ positive _ tree .",
    "this terminology is based on the conversion of @xmath61 to the unique normal form of the element with respect to the standard infinite generating set , and is described explicitly in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath52 be a finite rooted binary tree with @xmath8 carets which we number from @xmath57 through @xmath8 in infix order .",
    "we use the infix numbers as names for the carets , and the statement @xmath62 for two carets @xmath63 and @xmath64 simply expresses the relationship between the infix numbers .",
    "a caret is said to be a right ( resp .",
    "left ) caret if one of its sides lies on the right ( resp .",
    "left ) side of @xmath52 .",
    "the root caret can be considered either left or right .",
    "all other carets are called interior carets .    to multiply two elements @xmath65 and @xmath66 of @xmath0 we create unreduced representatives for the two elements , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in which @xmath69 .",
    "the product @xmath70 is then given by the ( possibly unreduced ) tree pair diagram @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , if we take @xmath72 to be a generator of the form @xmath73 we see that multiplication on the right by @xmath72 causes a proscribed rearrangement of the subtrees of @xmath65 . note that it may be necessary to add carets to the tree pair diagrams , creating unreduced representatives of these elements , in order to preform this multiplication .",
    "the rearrangement of the subtrees of @xmath59 under multiplication by @xmath74 and @xmath75 is depicted in figure [ fig : multiplication ] .     and",
    "capital letters represent ( possibly empty ) subtrees of the original tree pair diagram .",
    "multiplication by @xmath73 causes an analogous rearrangement of the subtrees at level @xmath77 . ]",
    "our formula for the word length of elements @xmath58 with respect to the generating set @xmath46 has two components .",
    "the first we call @xmath78 , as it is the word length of @xmath59 with respect to the standard infinite generating set @xmath79 for @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is simply the number of carets in the unique reduced tree pair diagram representing @xmath59 which are not right carets .",
    "the second component in the word length formula is twice what we term the _ penalty weight _ of the element . to make this precise , we begin by distinguishing a particular type of caret in a single tree .",
    "caret @xmath63 in a tree @xmath52 has _ type n _ if caret @xmath80 is an interior caret which lies in the right subtree of @xmath63 .",
    "we use this definition to describe certain carets in the tree pair diagram for @xmath58 which we call _ penalty carets _ as they help determine the penalty contribution to the word length @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath58 have a reduced tree pair diagram @xmath82 in which the carets are numbered in infix order .",
    "by caret @xmath63 in @xmath82 we mean the pair of carets numbered @xmath63 in each tree .",
    "caret @xmath63 in a tree pair diagram @xmath82 is a _ penalty caret _ if either    1 .",
    "@xmath63 has type @xmath83 in either @xmath84 or @xmath85 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath63 is a right caret in both @xmath84 and @xmath85 and caret @xmath63 is not the final caret in the tree pair diagram .",
    "to compute the penalty contribution to the word length for a given @xmath86 we use the following procedure . using a notion of caret adjacency defined below , we take the two trees @xmath84 and @xmath85 and construct a single tree @xmath87 , called a _ penalty tree _ , whose vertices correspond to a subset of the carets of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , necessarily including the penalty carets .",
    "this tree is assigned a _ weight _ according to the arrangement of its vertices .",
    "minimizing this weight over all possible penalty trees that can be constructed using the adjacencies between the carets of @xmath84 and @xmath85 yields the penalty weight @xmath88 .",
    "we may now state the word length formula precisely :    [ thm : length ] for every @xmath89 , the word length of @xmath59 with respect to the generating set @xmath90 is given by the formula @xmath91 where @xmath78 is the number of carets in the reduced tree pair diagram for @xmath59 which are not right carets , and @xmath88 is the penalty weight of @xmath59 .",
    "constructing penalty trees for elements @xmath58 requires a concept of directed caret adjacency , which is an extension of the infix order . to define the concept of adjacency between carets in a single tree @xmath52",
    ", we view each caret as a space rather than an inverted v. the point of intersection of the left and right edges of the caret naturally splits the boundary of this space into a left and right component .",
    "the space is bounded on the right ( resp . left ) by a _",
    "generalized right ( resp .",
    "left ) edge_. the generalized right ( resp . left ) edge may consist of actual left ( resp .",
    "right ) edges of other carets in the tree , in addition to the actual right ( resp . left ) edge of the caret itself .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote carets in a tree pair diagram @xmath82 and assume that @xmath92 .",
    "we say that @xmath63 is adjacent to @xmath64 , written @xmath93 , if there is a caret edge , in either @xmath84 or @xmath85 , which is both part of the generalized right edge of caret @xmath63 and the generalized left edge of caret @xmath64 .",
    "we equivalently say that _ traversing _ the generalized left edge of caret @xmath64 takes you to caret @xmath63 in at least one tree .",
    "it is always true that carets @xmath63 and @xmath80 satisfy @xmath94 .",
    "although the ordering of carets given by infix number is not symmetric but is transitive , the notion of caret adjacency is neither symmetric nor transitive .",
    "figure [ fig : adjacency ] shows an example of a single tree with the spaces corresponding to different carets shaded . in this tree , in addition to the adjacency relationships @xmath94 for @xmath95 , we also have @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we introduce a dummy caret denoted @xmath101 which is adjacent to all left carets in both @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "one can think of @xmath101 as being the space to the left of the left side of each tree .",
    "we now construct a penalty tree @xmath87 corresponding to the pair of trees @xmath82 , which has this dummy caret @xmath101 as its root , according to the following rules .    1 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath87 are a subset of the carets in the tree pair diagram , which we refer to by infix numbers : @xmath102 , always including @xmath101 .",
    "2 .   a directed edge may be drawn from vertex @xmath63 to vertex @xmath64 in @xmath87 if @xmath103 .",
    "3 .   there is a vertex for every penalty caret in @xmath82 .",
    "4 .   each leaf of @xmath87 corresponds to a penalty caret of @xmath82 .",
    "the only exception to this is when @xmath87 consists only of the root @xmath101 and no edges .",
    "the penalty tree @xmath87 is oriented in the sense that there is a unique path from @xmath101 to every vertex @xmath104 , and if this path passes through vertices @xmath105 then we must have @xmath106 . two vertices @xmath107 in the tree are comparable if there is either a path @xmath108 or @xmath109 with @xmath110 , and in this case we say @xmath111 .",
    "the penalty weight of a penalty tree is bounded above by the number of vertices on the tree , but not all vertices on the tree contribute to the weight .",
    "more precisely , we define :    the _ n - penalty weight _ @xmath112 of a penalty tree @xmath87 associated to @xmath113 is the number of vertices @xmath114 such that @xmath115 and there exists a leaf @xmath116 in @xmath87 with @xmath117 .",
    "these vertices are called the _ weighted _ carets .    to compute the penalty contribution @xmath88 to the word length @xmath81 for @xmath58",

    "thus there must be some reduction of the carets of @xmath85 , viewed as a subtree of @xmath189 , in order to obtain the reduced tree pair diagram for @xmath195 .",
    "we now consider which carets of @xmath85 , viewed as a subtree of @xmath189 might be reduced ; in order for a caret to be reduced after multiplication by a particular generator , it must be exposed , that is , both leaves have valence one .",
    "the only exposed carets of @xmath85 itself are carets @xmath17 and @xmath181 . since caret @xmath181 is a right caret in @xmath190 , and not the final right caret , it is not exposed in @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , it must be that in reducing @xmath187 , the original caret @xmath17 from the infix ordering on @xmath85 must cancel .",
    "we claim that in @xmath190 , caret @xmath17 must be a child of caret @xmath57 .",
    "if , in forming @xmath189 , no carets were added to either leaf of caret @xmath17 , then caret @xmath17 is exposed in @xmath189 , and hence it is exposed in @xmath190 , which implies that caret @xmath17 is a child of caret @xmath57 in @xmath190 . if , on the other hand , carets were added to the leaves of caret @xmath17 in forming @xmath189 , then they must all cancel in @xmath187 before caret @xmath17 does .",
    "but this means that in @xmath190 , these added carets must also hang from the leaves of caret @xmath17 , and once again , caret @xmath17 is a child of caret @xmath57 in @xmath190 .",
    "the fact that caret @xmath17 is a child of caret @xmath57 in @xmath190 provides a lower bound on @xmath196 as follows . to form the tree pair diagram for @xmath197 , consider the unreduced tree pair diagram @xmath187 .",
    "if @xmath198 , to form this product we consider these trees in the order @xmath199 , and add carets to each pair to ensure that the middle trees are identical .",
    "thus we must at least add the string of right carets @xmath200 , with caret @xmath181 the left child of @xmath201 , from @xmath189 to both trees in the diagram @xmath202 in order to perform this multiplication .",
    "since in @xmath190 , caret @xmath17 is a child of caret @xmath57 , but in @xmath203 caret @xmath57 is a child of caret @xmath17 , caret @xmath57 can not reduce in the product @xmath197 . hence , because of their configuration in @xmath203 , the entire string of carets @xmath204 do not reduce in the product @xmath197 .",
    "also , as we remarked above , caret @xmath181 is not removed through reduction in this product .",
    "hence we obtain the following lower bound on the word length of @xmath197 : @xmath205    let @xmath206 be the subpath of @xmath133 from @xmath207 to @xmath72 . since @xmath208 , it follows that @xmath209 . but traversing @xmath185 in reverse , followed by @xmath210 and then @xmath211 yields another path from @xmath120 to @xmath72 , so similarly @xmath212 , and hence @xmath213 .",
    "this implies that @xmath214 .    in the proof above , both @xmath59 and @xmath72",
    "are be represented by words of length @xmath170 involving only the generators @xmath215 , and @xmath216 , namely , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "hence , the above result can be extended to any generating set for @xmath0 which is a finite subset of the standard infinite generating set containing @xmath39 and @xmath1 .",
    "the identity map on @xmath2 is a quasi - isometry between the metric spaces @xmath15 and @xmath220 , where @xmath221 . since @xmath222",
    ", we remark that @xmath223 for any @xmath224 .",
    "in particular , @xmath225 for any @xmath176 .",
    "assume that @xmath226 is minimally almost convex .",
    "it is proven in theorem [ thm : notmacconsec ] that @xmath227 is not minimally almost convex .",
    "let @xmath228 and @xmath229 be the group elements used in the proof of theorem [ thm : notmacconsec ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath230 and @xmath231 ; if there was a shorter expression for either @xmath59 or @xmath72 with respect to @xmath6 , then there would be one with respect to @xmath232 as well .",
    "in addition , it is clear that since @xmath233 , we have @xmath234 .",
    "since @xmath226 is assumed to be minimally almost convex , there is a path @xmath133 of length at most @xmath235 connecting @xmath59 and @xmath72 which lies within the ball of radius @xmath170 relative to @xmath6 .",
    "since each group element @xmath137 along this path satisfies @xmath236 , this contradicts the assumption that @xmath237 is not minimally almost convex .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath226 can not be minimally almost convex .",
    "to extend the result of theorem 6.1 of @xcite to arbitrary finite subsets of the infinite generating set containing @xmath39 , we show first that word length with respect to one of these arbitrary generating sets differs from word length with respect to some generating set containing @xmath1 only by an additive constant .",
    "let @xmath58 , and suppose @xmath241 , where @xmath242 .",
    "then @xmath243 where @xmath244 .",
    "now in the cases where @xmath245 , we have @xmath246 , and in the cases where @xmath247 with @xmath248 , then @xmath249 . hence @xmath250 .",
    "similarly , one sees that @xmath251 .",
