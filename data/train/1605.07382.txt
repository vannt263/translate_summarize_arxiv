    "eruptive stars with peak luminosity values between the typical luminosities of novae and supernovae ( sn ) form an heterogeneous group ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the remaining gap objects that are not supernovae are part of a still heterogeneous group that is generally termed intermediate luminosity optical transients ( ilots ; @xcite ) . @xcite further classified ilots into three types of objects :    1 .",
    "intermediate - luminous red transients ( ilrt ) .",
    "these are ilots of evolved stars , such as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or extreme - agb ( exagb ) stars , like ngc  300  ot2008 - 1 ( ngc  300ot ; @xcite ) and sn  2008s @xcite .",
    "giant eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbv ) and sn impostors .",
    "examples include the great eruption ( ge ) of @xmath4 carinae in the years 18371856 , and the pre - explosion eruptions of sn  2009ip . within the context of the binary model lbv",
    "giant eruptions might be considered in some sense to be the massive relatives of ilrts @xcite .",
    "luminous red novae ( lrn ) or red transients ( rt ) or merger - bursts .",
    "these outbursts are powered by a full merger of two stars .",
    "the process of destruction of the less dense star , on to the denser star or inside its envelope , releases gravitational energy that powers the transient .",
    "examples include v838 mon and v1309  sco .",
    "merger events of stars with sub - stellar objects are also included .",
    "as more ilots are being discovered we add them to the energy - time diagram ( etd ) , which shows their total energy against the eruption duration @xcite .",
    "many of the ilots sit on the optical transient stripe ( ots ) in the etd , suggesting they are powered by a similar source of energy .",
    "models for ilots include single - star models ( e.g. , @xcite for ilrts and @xcite for a sn impostor ) , and binary stellar models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that @xcite cast doubt that the progenitor star of the ilrts ngc  300ot and sn  2008s survived the ilrt event . in a merger",
    "processes the secondary star can survive the first encounter , in which case the two stars form a common envelope ( ce ) , or alternatively be destroyed on encounter . the close binary interaction can lead to enhanced mass loss and mass transfer . @xcite and @xcite based their model for ilots on a high rate of mass loss through the second lagrangian point .",
    "the collision of equatorially ejected mass transfers kinetic energy to radiation .",
    "no jets are considered in their model .    a mass transfer process , whether in close detached systems , or in the grazing envelope evolution ( gee ) , or during the ce evolution ( cee ) , can lead to the formation of an accretion disc or an accretion belt around the more compact star .",
    "such a disc might launch jets .",
    "the powering of ilots by accretion onto the more compact star in a binary system is termed the high - accretion - powered ilot ( hapi ) model , and was developed by us in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the hapi model was then applied to the formation of ilot events during the gee @xcite . in some cases",
    "the interacting system is in fact a triple stellar system .",
    "the tertiary star might induce orbital instabilities and causes the two inner stars to interact , and in other cases all three stars can participate in the mass transfer process .",
    "several ilots have been attributed to the cee of a binary stellar system , or to the onset of the ce . @xcite and @xcite attributed the ilot v838  mon to a merger process of two stars where the low mass star had been destroyed . @xcite and",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , suggested that v838  mon was powered when planets entered the envelope of the star and formed a ce .",
    "scenarios of cee with a stellar companion followed with the ilots ogle-2002-blg-360 @xcite , v1309  sco @xcite , and recently m31lrn  2015 @xcite . in section [ sec : m31lrn ] we study the cee scenario that was proposed by @xcite to account for m31lrn  2015 and propose the hapi model as an alternative explanation for the same ilot .    in some cases the two jets that are launched from the compact companion might expel more mass from the system , and form an expanding bipolar nebula @xcite , such as the bipolar nebula of @xmath4 carinae , the homunculus , that was formed in the ge ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xmath4 carinae is known to be a binary systems @xcite that did not enter a cee .",
    "the sharp peaks in the light curve during the ge occurred around periastron passages of the binary system @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculated that the progenitor of sn  2009ip was in a binary system , and suggested that the pre - explosion outbursts of sn  2009ip occurred during , and as a result of , periastron passages .    in section [ sec : ptf13efv ]",
    "we analyze the ilot sn  2015bh ( aka snhunt  275 ; ptf  13efv ; psn j09093496 + 3307204 ) that had at least two outbursts .",
    "it is not clear yet whether the last peak was casued by a real sn ( e.g. , @xcite ) or an impostor .",
    "several works ( e.g. , @xcite ) noticed that sn  2015bh has some similarities with sn  2009ip .",
    "@xcite analyzed the behavior of sn  2015bh and discussed its behavior within the context of a single star suffering an outburst with a super - eddington luminosity .",
    "we instead propose a binary model .    in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize by concluding that a binary model based on jets , the hapi - jets model , seems to explain the best many of the properties of ilots .",
    "the ilot m31lrn  2015 was discovered in january 2015 @xcite , was compared to the merger - burst ( lrn ) v838  mon ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and was suggested to be a result of a merger process ( e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e. , be an lrn ( rt ; or merger - bursts ) .",
    "the bolometric light curve can be divided into two parts .",
    "a rise to the peak and decline , lasting from about -10 days to + 10 days relative to the peak , and a plateau phase of about constant luminosity lasting for about another 40 days .      in a recent paper @xcite",
    "propose a scenario for m31lrn  2015 where a main - sequence ( ms ) secondary star of mass @xmath5 entered a cee with a giant primary star of mass @xmath6 and a radius of @xmath7 .",
    "the process that leads to the cee , according to their model , is the darwin instability .",
    "they further suggest that the main energy source of the radiated energy of @xmath8 during the plateau phase , about 10 to 50 days past the peak , is the recombination of the ejected mass . according to their model ,",
    "this requires that the ejected mass that recombined amounts to at least @xmath9 .",
    "we see several problems in the model proposed by @xcite , as we explain in the following subsections .",
    "we then propose an alternative scenario .",
    "ilots that are powered by merger ( merger - bursts ) need not be powered by accretion of mass onto the compact companion . such is v1390  sco @xcite .",
    "however , there are significant differences between v1390  sco and the model @xcite propose for m31lrn  2015 . the binary orbital period of the progenitor of v1309  sco was 1.4 day , with a radius of the primary star of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the radiated energy in the outburst of v1390  sco was @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the energy stored in the orbital motion of the binary system , @xmath12 , was about two orders of magnitude higher than the radiated energy during the outburst @xcite @xmath13 the energy stored in the orbital motion of the progenitor of v1390  sco can easily account also for the kinetic energy of the ejected matter which is about @xmath14 times as large as the radiated energy , and for the energy required to inflate the envelope @xcite .    in the model of @xcite for m31lrn  2015",
    "the energy stored in the orbital motion is @xmath15 .",
    "the radiated energy during the peak and plateau combined is @xmath16 , and we find @xmath17 the typical value of @xmath18 for v1309  sco is @xmath19 times larger than what the binary progenitor model proposed by @xcite gives for m31lrn  2015 .",
    "we note that the relevant energy to consider is the energy released by the binary system as the secondary stars spirals - in deep to the giant star .",
    "this is done in section [ subsubsec : mass ] .",
    "furthermore , neither the scenario proposed by @xcite nor the one we propose attribute a specific role to the value of @xmath18 . despite these two limitations , the large ratio @xmath20 suggests that v1390  sco can not be used to characterize m31lrn , or to conclude that it was powered by the onset of a cee .",
    "the particular binary parameters adopted in the model of @xcite are weakly constrained by observations , and the energy range they provide is quite large .",
    "only if the maximum value applies we can get @xmath21 .",
    "this is very unlikely .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is the relevant energy if the secondary star motion is slowed down rapidly in the outer regions of the primary star .",
    "however , the large radius of the progenitor of m31lrn  2015 of @xmath7 @xcite implies that the density in its envelope is very low , and the much denser ms companion will not slow down much in the outer envelope .",
    "the secondary star must penetrate deep into the envelope .",
    "based on crude energy considerations alone , namely that @xmath23 , we conclude that it is unlikely that the merger - burst model that applies to v1309  sco can be scaled to explain the outburst of m31lrn  2015 .      for about 30 days , from the peak to 30 days post - peak",
    ", the photosphere of the ejected material expands with a velocity of @xmath24 @xcite . as according to their model",
    "the radiated energy is recombination energy , the recombining gas in the first 30 days must move at about this velocity .",
    "the recombining gas in the last 20 days can move at a lower velocity of @xmath25 .",
    "overall , the kinetic energy of the ejected gas in their model is @xmath26 .",
    "the most massive secondary in their model has a mass of @xmath27 .",
    "the secondary star has to spiral - in to a radius of @xmath28 to account for the kinetic energy , given by @xmath29 in the above equation part of the energy on the right - hand - side must go to radiation , and for that we used the ` @xmath30 ' sign .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the radiated energy is much smaller than the kinetic energy so we can neglect it .",
    "taking @xmath31 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 gives that the final orbital energy of the binary system at the final orbit of the secondary star is @xmath33    with the goal to asses the mass enclosed in each radius , we run a model of a @xmath34 star using ` mesa ` @xcite and let it evolve to the agb stage , to the point when its radius is @xmath7 , as estimated by @xcite .",
    "our model is shown in figure [ fig : profile4msun ] .    to satisfy equation ( [ eq : e2f ] ) the secondary star must spiral - in to a radius of @xmath35    % 5 - 3.793 \\left ( \\frac{m_2}{0.6 \\rmmodot } \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{e_{\\rm 2,f}}{3.6 \\times 10^{47 } \\erg } \\right)^{-1 } \\rmrodot ,     % 3.626e+47 \\label{eq : r2ej2}\\ ] ] where",
    "the radius @xmath36 and mass @xmath37 are scaled according to the solution of equation ( [ eq : r2ej2 ] ) with the model presented in figure [ fig : profile4msun ] .",
    "the mass of the primary star that resides above radius @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "if we take half the above value of kinetic energy , @xmath40 , we get @xmath41 and the mass above it is @xmath42 .",
    "even if we consider that not all this mass was ejected , these values are still much larger than the ejected mass of @xmath43 according to the model of @xcite .",
    "namely , the secondary star deposits its orbital energy to a mass much larger than a @xmath44 .",
    "so for the @xmath44 to acquire a kinetic energy of @xmath45 , the secondary must release more gravitational energy .",
    "this implies that it spirals - in deeper than @xmath36 estimated above .",
    "it is not clear at all that under these conditions , where the energy is distributed among several solar masses , a small mass of @xmath43 can escape with a velocity that is about twice the escape velocity from the binary system .",
    "another problem we see in in the model proposed by @xcite concerns the time scale of envelope ejection . in the case of a powering by recombination the photosphere moves",
    "inward in the mass coordinate .",
    "hence , most of the ejected mass was ejected at the same time and at the same velocity of @xmath24 . however , as was shown in section [ subsubsec : mass ] the secondary star needs to spiral - in to a very small radius .",
    "this requires at least one dynamical time at the surface , and likely much more .",
    "namely , the ejection time will last over a time longer than 10 days .",
    "this is a substantial fraction of the 30 days during which the photosphere expands with a constant velocity .",
    "this does not fit the observations , unless later ejecta are moving at higher velocities than @xmath24 and catch - up with the photosphere .",
    "but this makes the energy and mass problems discussed in the previous subsections even more severe .",
    "we propose that the ilot m31lrn  2015 was not powered from the merger process itself , but rather by accretion onto a companion .",
    "namely , instead of a merger - burst model ( or lrn or rt ; see section [ sec : intro ] for terminology ) , it was powered by a companion accreting mass from a giant star , namely , an ilrt . as for powering the radiation , instead of recombination energy",
    "we suggested that the accreted energy is channelled to radiation and kinetic energy of jets ( winds ) .",
    "the collision of jets with previously ejected mass can convert more kinetic energy to radiation .",
    "the system is more like an ilot during a grazing envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that the kinetic energy is 417 times the radiated energy , depends on the velocity .",
    "we shall adopt a total energy of @xmath46 , but note that the energy can be even smaller , as our model is not based on recombination , and can work with ejected mass of much less than @xmath44 .",
    "we scale the mass and radius of the companion with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "if the energy comes from accretion onto the companion , then in order to supply the total energy the accreted mass should be @xmath49 the escape velocity from the companion is @xmath50 , and so it can easily account for ejecta speed of @xmath24 .",
    "the accretion rate implied by equation [ eq : macc ] for an event duration of @xmath51 , is @xmath52 .",
    "this accretion rate is extremely high .",
    "@xcite constructed a scenario by which a solar type star can accrete mass at a rate of @xmath53 , and more massive stars can accrete at an even high rate .",
    "to accrete at such a high rate the accreted gas must get rid of its extra energy .",
    "most of it carried in the jets @xcite . to account for the radiated energy",
    ", it is required that about 10 per cent of the kinetic energy carried by the jets is radiated .    to estimate the time scale for the event in our model",
    ", we shall assume that accretion occurs through a disc , and that the time scale of the event is in the order of the viscosity time of the disc @xmath54 .",
    "assuming a simple thin @xmath55-disc , the viscosity is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the spped of sound and @xmath58 is the disc hight ( @xcite ) , we get @xmath59 in the above equation we took the value of the keplerian time on the stellar surface @xmath60 . on the other hand at these very high accretion rates",
    "the disk is likely to be thicker @xcite , and the term @xmath61 can reduce the time scale by about an order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath62 day . as the disc extends to somewhat larger than the secondary surface , the viscosity time",
    "is estimated to be @xmath63  weeks .",
    "overall we get that @xmath54 is about the time scale of the observed event .",
    "the ilot sn  2015bh ( snhunt  275 ) holds several puzzles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it undergone a strong outburst in 2015 , a weaker one in 2013 , and possibly an earlier one in 2009 .",
    "first and most important is whether the last outburst was a terminal sn explosion .",
    "@xcite bring arguments that might suggest that it was not a sn explosion .",
    "we here accept this view , and examine its consequences .",
    "we note though that @xcite argue that the last outburst was a faint sn explosion .",
    "the second puzzle is whether the detection on 2009 sep 10 that looks like an outburst is real .",
    "@xcite analyzed it and conclude that it is not an outburst , but rather it is likely a bad pixel or radiation hit event ( i.e. , cosmic ray ) .",
    "we accept this conclusion , despite three interesting coincidences that otherwise might have hinted at a real detection .    1 .",
    "the luminosity of the one - point 2009 peak ( mjd 55084.5089 ) was only @xmath64 per cent above the maximum one in the 2013 outburst .",
    "the time of the detection in 2009 took place @xmath65 before @xmath66 ( the time of the eruption in 2015 ) .",
    "this is about 4 times the interval of @xmath67 between the 2013 and 2015 peaks .",
    "the one point detection before and one point detection after the 2009 peak are more luminous than the others points outside the peak in 2009 .",
    "the new light - curve presented by @xcite indicate that there is high emission earlier in 2009 .",
    "the light - curve also presents an earlier outburst in 2008 , and a general complicated behavior . with the present data we refrain from fitting an orbital period for the system , and leave this question open .    @xcite discuss the behavior of sn  2015bh within the context of a single star suffering an outburst with a super - eddington luminosity following the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "we calculate the optical depth of the super - eddington outburst model of @xcite . according to their results ,",
    "the mass lost in the 2013 eruption is @xmath68 .",
    "accounting for @xmath69 the average mass loss rate is @xmath70 . taking their observed ejecta velocity @xmath71 , their photospheric radius .",
    "following a comment by n. shaviv ( private communication ) we take the photosphere to be at @xmath72 . ]",
    "@xmath73 , opacity of @xmath74 , and assuming spherical symmetry , the optical depth for a wind blown for a very long time is @xmath75 this is too low to account for a photosphere .",
    "we see this as a challenge to the single - star - super - eddington outburst model .",
    "we propose that instead of a super - eddington outburst , sn  2015bh is ( or was ) a massive eccentric binary stellar system that underwent a giant eruption in 2013 , followed by a strong eruption in 2015 , which might have been a sn or a stellar merger event .",
    "the binary period might be either @xmath76 or a simple fraction of this number .",
    "this raises the possibility that the mechanism behind the 2013 outburst is similar to the mechanism behind the ge of @xmath4 carinae .",
    "if the 2015 peak was not the result of a terminal event , i.e. , a sn explosion or a stellar merger event , then the binary model allows for another eruption at the next periastron passage .",
    "if the orbital period is indeed @xmath76 , the next event might take place in october 2016 .    applying the hapi - jets model , the energy of the 2013 eruption , and the 2015 eruption if was not a terminal event ( which we consider unlikely ) ,",
    "came from accretion of gas to the binary companion , which lead to the formation of accretion disk and the launching of jets .",
    "a prediction of the model is a bipolar gas - ejection morphology , such as that during the ge of @xmath4 carinae .    as an illustrative example",
    "we assume that the energy results from accretion onto a ms secondary of @xmath77 and radius @xmath78 , and the radiated energy of the eruption is a fraction @xmath79 of the accretion energy .",
    "the secondary star can be more massive , but the gravitational potential on its surface will not changes much if it is a ms star . we can then estimate the accreted mass in the 2013 eruption to be @xmath80    for an event length of @xmath81 , the implied accretion rate is @xmath82 . according to the high accretion rate model proposed by @xcite a main sequence star of @xmath83 can accommodate such a high accretion rate if launches energetic jets .",
    "these are the jets that collide with previously ejected gas and emit the radiation . in the process proposed by @xcite the accreting star itself does not radiate much above the eddington luminosity .",
    "most of the energy is rather carried by jets , i.e. , kinetic energy .",
    "the collision of the jets with the ambient gas heats the gas and leads to the highly super - eddington luminosity .",
    "if we repeat the estimate for the 2015 eruption , we find @xmath84 taking @xmath85 can lower this estimate to @xmath86 .",
    "however , @xcite estimate the total radiated energy of the 2015 eruption to be @xmath87 . the hapi model can not account for such radiated energy in this system .",
    "the estimate for @xmath88 is similar to the estimate of @xmath89 for the mass accreted onto the companion of @xmath4 car during the ge @xcite .",
    "though in the case of @xmath4 car the eruption lasted for about twenty years , most of the accretion probably occurred very close to 24 periastron passages , making the accretion time in the order of a week or two .",
    "however , the 2015 event was short , @xmath90 , and the implied accretion rate is huge , @xmath91 .",
    "we therefore regards the hapi model less likely for the 2015 event .",
    "the 2015 event is more likely a true supernova or a violent merger event .",
    "we next consider a violent head - on ( or almost head - on ) merger .",
    "adopting the accretion model for the 2015 eruption of sn  2015bh would need a strong stretching of the parameters , in particular a much more massive ms companion .",
    "instead , it is easier to account for the energy of the 2015 eruption if it came from a merger of the two stars .",
    "the merger is actually an almost head - on collision of the two stars that were in a very high eccentric orbit before merger .",
    "it is different from the onset of a ce phase . in the head - on collision case the gas - ejection morphology",
    "will be highly non - spherical .",
    "if the secondary star is completely stopped as it hit the primary envelope in the head - on collision , then the energy that is released is @xmath92 a fraction of @xmath14 per cent will be enough to account for the radiated energy deduced by @xcite , and a fraction of @xmath93 per cent is needed for the radiated energy calculated by @xcite .",
    "namely , if during the very short time of the collision , a fraction of the orbital period , the velocity of the secondary star is reduced by @xmath94 per cent , the released energy can account for the energy of the outburst . in the case of a merger - burst event , no further outbursts will take place .",
    "we discussed two recent ilots in the context of the binary model . in section",
    "[ sec : m31lrn ] we discussed the ilot m31lrn  2015 .",
    "we critically studied the model proposed by @xcite , according to which a low mass ms star entered a common envelope phase with a giant star of radius @xmath95 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the ejected gas results from the spiraling - in process of the companion into the envelope , and the radiation comes from the recombination of the ejected mass .",
    "we found severe problems with that model .",
    "we suggested instead that m31lrn  2015 was an ilot powered by a ms companion accreting from a giant , i.e. , an ilrt type of ilot ( see section [ sec : intro ] for terminology ) .",
    "the accretion is through an accretion disc that launches jets .",
    "the jets carry most of the energy , such that the accreting star itself does not radiate much above its eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "the source of the radiated energy is the radiated energy by the disk and the conversion of kinetic energy to radiation when the jets collide with the material that was ejected a short time earlier . in many cases accretion",
    "might be more efficient than recombination in powering ilots @xcite . in the case of the ilot",
    "m31lrn  2015 the companion needs to accrete a mass of @xmath96 ( equation [ eq : macc ] ) .",
    "in section [ sec : ptf13efv ] we discussed the ilot sn  2015bh ( snhunt  275 ) that underwent two eruptions , one in 2013 and another in 2015 .",
    "we raise the possibility that the 2015 outburst might it was a head - on collision , though it was more likely a terminal supernova explosion .",
    "we examined the super - eddington single star model as proposed by @xcite for this ilot .",
    "we found that the mass ejected according to the super - eddington single - star model in the 2013 outburst is insufficient to account for the radius of the photosphere at @xmath97 .",
    "here as well we suggested the hapi - jets model , where the 2013 eruption was powered by accretion onto a companion in an eccentric orbit . in case",
    "that the 2015 outburst was not a terminal supernova explosion , we speculated that the very energetic outburst might have been a head - on merger event of two massive stars ( equation [ eq : merger ] ) .",
    "overall , with the presently available observations we can not tell conclusively whether the 2015 was a sn explosion , a terminal merger event , or an accretion event that left the binary system intact .    over all , the binary model for ilots can account for different types of outbursts , but one should be careful in identifying the exact process .",
