    "<S> a pair of coherent femtosecond pulse excitations applied to a molecule with strong electron - phonon coupling creates a coherent superposition of a low momentum and a high momentum wavepacket in the vibrational states of both the excited state and the ground state of the coherent transition . </S>",
    "<S> as the excited state is accelerated further , interference between the high momentum ground state contribution and the low momentum excited state contribution causes a photon echo . </S>",
    "<S> this photon echo is a direct consequence of quantum interference between separate vibrational trajectories and can therefore provide experimental evidence of the non - classical properties of molecular vibrations .    `` _ the feature of quantum mechanics which most distinguishes it from classical mechanics is the coherent superposition of distinct physical states_''@xcite . in the case of molecular vibrations , the motion of </S>",
    "<S> a single gaussian wavepacket usually corresponds well with the classical motion for the potential considered . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum mechanics also allows coherent superpositions between two wavepackets with distinct positions and momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of such superpositions depend on the phase between the two gaussian wavepackets , a property that has no analog in the classical theory . </S>",
    "<S> the study of such superpositions should therefore provide insights into the non - classical features of quantum mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> the creation and measurement of vibrational wavepackets by optical excitations has been studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in particular , the creation of a coherent superposition of two distinct gaussian wavepackets ( also referred to as a `` cat state '' ) in a molecular vibration has been predicted if the molecule is excited by a sequence of two femtosecond pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is difficult to obtain experimental evidence indicating the successful creation of the coherent superposition . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , it will be shown that the nonlinear optical contributions in the formation of the superposition state automatically produce a photon echo effect that corresponds to the `` which path '' interference between two distinct trajectories of the molecular vibration . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the vibrational photon echo may provide direct experimental evidence of quantum coherence between two vibrational wavepackets .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian describing the electron - phonon interaction of an electronic two level system and a single vibrational degree of freedom may be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the effective mass of the vibration , and @xmath2 and and @xmath3 describe the vibrational potentials associated with the electronic ground state @xmath4 and the electronic excited state @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the position operator @xmath6 and the conjugate momentum operator @xmath7 represent the dynamical variables of the vibrational mode under consideration .    initially , the molecular system is in the electronic ground state @xmath8 and the vibrational state @xmath9 is localized near the minimum of the ground state potential @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore convenient to define this minimum as @xmath10 and its potential as @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> if the timescales considered are much shorter than the period of a molecular vibration , the vibrational wavefunction will always remain close to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the momentum is also close to zero initially , and its changes can be considered small enough to neglect the quadratic term @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the total hamiltonian can then be linearized in @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate hamiltonian reads @xmath13 & & \\mbox{with}\\hspace{0.5 cm }   \\hbar \\omega_0 = v_e(x=0 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox{and}\\hspace{0.5 cm } f_e=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } v_e(x)\\big|_{x=0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this hamiltonian describes the linear acceleration of the excited state component of the vibrational state by the force @xmath14 . in terms of the momentum eigenstate components @xmath15 and @xmath16 , this acceleration can be written as @xmath17 note that this evolution of the vibrational wavefunction preserves the quantum coherence between the excited state and the ground state contributions . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not possible to assign separate `` realities '' to excited state and ground state molecules . </S>",
    "<S> instead , any coherent overlap between the vibrational states corresponds to a coherent electronic dipole . </S>",
    "<S> this coherent dipole is given by the operator @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> its expectation value reads @xmath19 the electronic dipole of the molecular transition thus represents an interference between the accelerated excited state and the non - accelerated ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration process separates the vibrational state like a beam splitter separates the incoming fields . in a photon echo experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the first pulse at @xmath20 splits the vibrational dynamics , the second pulse at @xmath21 `` reflects '' the excited state into the ground state and vice versa , and the photon echo indicates interference between two indistinguishable paths of acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state component of the photon echo dipole corresponds to acceleration during @xmath22 followed by a constant momentum of @xmath23 during @xmath24 , and the excited state component corresponds to zero momentum during @xmath22 followed by acceleration to a momentum of @xmath23 during @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> these trajectories are illustrated in figure [ trajectories ] .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we apply this description of the molecular dynamics to a pair of ultrafast excitations at times @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses are considered to be much shorter than @xmath25 . before the first pulse , </S>",
    "<S> the molecule is in its ground state , given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> between the two pulses ( @xmath22 ) , the coherent evolution of the partially excited state is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a measure of the pulse area exciting the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of the coherent dipole evolves according to @xmath30 which corresponds to the autocorrelation of the vibrational wavefunction in momentum space , @xmath31 . the dipole dephasing time @xmath32 is therefore given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the momentum uncertainty of the initial wavepacket . if @xmath34 is much smaller than @xmath23 , then the coherent dipole will be close to zero at @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the second pulse at @xmath35 then restores dipole coherence by transferring part of the ground state component to the excited state and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the total molecular state for @xmath36 reads @xmath37 the total vibrational state now consists of four separate contributions . </S>",
    "<S> initially ( @xmath35 ) , there is dipole coherence between two pairs , the one around @xmath38 and the one around @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this coherence is lost as the excited state is accelerated . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole dynamics of the decoherence process reads @xmath40 this corresponds to the linear response of the partially excited two level system to the second pulse . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a revival of the dipole coherence in the form of a photon echo as the excited state from @xmath38 is accelerated to @xmath39 and interferes with the ground state component there . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ wavepackets ] illustrates the coherent wavefunction at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole dynamics close to @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 this result is again equal to the autocorrelation of @xmath31 , but it is centered around @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ pulses ] shows the sequence of pulses and the dipole response . </S>",
    "<S> since the first two dipole signals are immediate responses to the exciting pulses , they suddenly appear at @xmath20 and at @xmath21 , followed by a gradual decay given by the autocorrelation of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the echo pulse arises from the hidden coherence in the dynamics following the second pulse at @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore appears gradually and is symmetric around @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> since dipole coherence always indicates an interference between ground state and excited state components , the echo indicates equal momentum of the accelerated excited state and the non - accelerated ground state . in terms of the average momentum of the four separate contributions , </S>",
    "<S> figure [ trajectories ] shows the trajectories involved in the quantum interferences indicated by the dipole expectation value @xmath43 . by comparing the dipole evolution given in figure [ pulses ] with the trajectories in figure [ trajectories ] , the optical signals can be related to the quantum dynamics of the vibration .    </S>",
    "<S> the analogy between photon echoes in inhomogeneously broadened transitions and the molecular photon echoes discussed here arises from the assumption that the position coordinate @xmath6 remains nearly constant during the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneity is then a consequence of the randomness of the position coordinate @xmath6 given by the spatial width of the vibrational wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the photon echo in an inhomogeneously broadened medium and the vibrational photon echo discussed here is that the coherence of the contributions from different positions corresponds to a well defined momentum . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore impossible to identify each precise position @xmath44 with a different molecule , since this would imply an infinite momentum uncertainty . for most practical purposes , however </S>",
    "<S> , the experimental setup corresponds to a conventional photon echo experiment .    in order to satisfy the assumption that @xmath6 does not change much during the experiment </S>",
    "<S> , the spatial shifts induced by the velocity @xmath45 during the delay time @xmath25 must be much smaller than the spatial width of the vibrational wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> the shift in position can be determined by integrating the velocity @xmath45 over time . </S>",
    "<S> the total shift of position thus contains a `` memory '' of the momentum path taken by the molecular vibration , destroying the quantum interference . at the interference point , </S>",
    "<S> the difference in position between the ground state component and the excited state component with @xmath39 is @xmath46 in momentum representation , this shift appears as a phase factor of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal coherent dipole of the echo pulse is then reduced by a factor of @xmath48 since the ground state of a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath49 is a gaussian wavepacket with a momentum variance of @xmath50 , the decoherence factor @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 the dependence of the decoherence factor @xmath51 on delay time @xmath25 is shown in figure [ deph ] . </S>",
    "<S> this fourth order exponential decay should be a typical signature of molecular photon echoes , allowing a distinction between such echoes and the echo effect caused by inhomogeneous broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence time @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 an estimate of the dephasing time can be obtained from typical values of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> for these values , the dephasing time is about @xmath58 or ten femtoseconds . in order to obtain a clear separation between the two pulses exciting the molecule , </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore necessary to use extremely short pulses . </S>",
    "<S> if the pulses do overlap , an echo can still be obtained , but since the vibrational wavepackets overlap as well the interference can not be traced to two separate trajectories .    </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : t ] ) suggests that optimal results can be obtained in a molecular vibration with a high effective mass @xmath1 , a low vibrational frequency @xmath49 in the ground state , and a small force @xmath14 on the excited state . </S>",
    "<S> however , a strong force @xmath14 is necessary to ensure a short dipole dephasing time . using @xmath50 , the ratio of decoherence time @xmath53 and dephasing time @xmath32 is @xmath59 for the typical values given above </S>",
    "<S> , this ratio is about three . in order to obtain a higher ratio , </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable to have a lower effective mass @xmath1 , a lower vibrational frequency @xmath49 , and a stronger force @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the best system for observing a vibrational photon echo would thus be a system with an unusually low ground state vibrational frequency . </S>",
    "<S> possibly , a very unstable bond with a shallow low curvature potential could be used . a transition to an anti - bonding state </S>",
    "<S> could then trigger a dissociation process with a sufficiently high initial accelerating force @xmath14 to provide rapid dephasing .    in conclusion , the results presented here highlight the possibility of using nonlinear femtosecond spectroscopy to probe the quantum nature of vibrational states . </S>",
    "<S> it also reveals fundamental quantum mechanical details of the interaction between the coherent dipole dynamics and the vibrational dynamics in molecular systems , thus providing some insights into the role of vibrational quantum coherence in the nonlinear optics of molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this method could thus provide a starting point for a more general investigation of interference effects in the dynamics of bound atoms . </S>"
