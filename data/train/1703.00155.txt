    "the @xmath0 meson consists of two heavy quarks with different flavor numbers , i.e. , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) for the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) meson .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is a spin - triplet ground state ( @xmath15 @xmath5 @xmath16 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 meson lies below the @xmath17 meson pair threshold .",
    "what is more , the mass difference @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 50 mev @xcite is far less than the mass of pion .",
    "so , the @xmath0 meson decays via the strong interaction are completely forbidden .",
    "however , the @xmath0 meson decays through the electromagnetic and weak interactions are allowable within the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "the dominant magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transition , @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath22 , is strongly suppressed by the compact phase spaces , which results in a lifetime @xmath23",
    "@xmath9 @xmath24 @xcite . besides , the @xmath0 meson carries explicitly nonzero bottom and charm quantum numbers ( @xmath25 @xmath5 @xmath26 @xmath5 @xmath27 ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 meson can decay by means of the flavor - changing weak transitions .",
    "the @xmath0 meson weak decays , similar to the @xmath28 meson weak decays @xcite , can be divided into three classes : ( 1 ) the @xmath29 quark decay with the @xmath30 quark as a spectator , ( 2 ) the @xmath30 quark decay with the @xmath29 quark as a spectator , and ( 3 ) the @xmath29 and @xmath30 quarks annihilation into a virtual @xmath31 boson .",
    "the @xmath0 meson has a large mass .",
    "in addition , both constituent quarks of the @xmath0 meson can decay individually .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 meson has abundant weak decay channels .",
    "however , the @xmath0 meson weak decays have received much less attention in the past .",
    "there is no experimental measurement report @xcite and few theoretical investigations concerned with the @xmath0 weak decay .",
    "fortunately , with the high luminosity and large production cross section of the @xmath0 meson @xcite at the running lhc , a huge amount of the @xmath0 meson data samples would be accumulated .",
    "some of the @xmath0 meson weak decays might be explored in the future .",
    "the @xmath0 meson provides another laboratory to study the heavy flavor weak decay .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the nonleptonic @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays with the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite , where @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our motivations are as follows .",
    "firstly , due to the development of experimental instruments and technology , final states of the charmonium and the charged pion and/or kaon are easy to identify experimentally . with the advancement of high energy hadron collider experiments",
    ", the @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath2 decays have been observed @xcite . due to the production cross section @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 in hadron collisions @xcite ,",
    "hopefully , it is anticipated that the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays might be observed experimentally in the future . a theoretical study on the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2",
    ", @xmath3 decays is necessary to provide the future experimental investigation with an immediate reference .",
    "secondly , due to the relations of @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath18 @xmath21 @xmath20 @xcite , one possible background for the @xmath28 meson decays might come from the @xmath0 meson decays into the same final states .",
    "hence , the study of the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays will provide some useful information for the experimental analysis on the @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays .",
    "thirdly , as it is well known , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath35 could be determined from the semileptonic decays of the @xmath25 meson to the @xmath36 meson .",
    "however , there exists a more than @xmath37 discrepancy between the values from exclusive and inclusive determinations@xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays are induced actually by the @xmath29 @xmath1 @xmath30 ( or @xmath39 @xmath1 @xmath40 ) transition at the quark level . the weak interaction coupling and",
    "the decay amplitudes are proportional to the ckm matrix element @xmath35 [ see eq.([hamilton ] ) or eqs.([amp - bc - psip])-([amp - bc - ccp ] ) ] .",
    "hence , the @xmath38 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays , together with nonleptonic @xmath41 @xmath1 @xmath42 decays and semileptonic @xmath41",
    "@xmath1 @xmath43 decays , are expected to give more stringent constraints on the ckm matrix element @xmath35 , other parameters extracted from the @xmath25 meson decays , and contributions from possible new physics .",
    "fourthly , owing to the same dynamical mechanism of the bottom quark decay , many phenomenological models used for the @xmath25 meson decays could , in principle , be generalized and applied to the @xmath0 meson weak decays .",
    "the practical applicability and reliability of the pqcd approach can be reevaluated with the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays .",
    "further , the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 decays provide an opportunity to study polarization effects involved in the vector meson decays .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework and decay amplitudes with the pqcd approach are presented in section [ sec02 ] .",
    "section [ sec03 ] is devoted to the numerical results and discussion .",
    "the last section is a summary .",
    "by means of the operator product expansion and the renormalization group ( rg ) method , the effective hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 weak decays is expressed in terms of four - quark operators with the process - independent couplings of the wilson coefficients @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 where the fermi coupling constant @xmath46 @xmath21 @xmath47 @xcite ; current operator @xmath48 @xmath5 @xmath49 ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 are color indices . the ckm factor @xmath52 can be written in terms of the wolfenstein parameters @xcite , i.e. , @xmath53 the auxiliary parameter @xmath54 separates the physical contributions into two parts .",
    "the hard contributions above the scale @xmath54 are summarized into the wilson coefficients @xmath55 . due to the properties of asymptotic freedom of qcd forces , the wilson coefficients are , in principle ,",
    "computable order by order with the rg equation improved perturbation theory as long as the scale @xmath54 is not too small @xcite .",
    "the physical contributions below the scale @xmath54 are included in the hadronic matrix elements ( hme ) where the local four - quark operators are sandwiched between initial and final states .",
    "the participating hadrons are bounds states of partons . with the participation of the strong interaction in the transition from quarks to hadrons , especially ,",
    "the presence of long - distance qcd effects and the entanglement of nonperturbative and perturbative contributions , how to properly evaluate hme is one of major tasks for a serious phenomenology of weak decays of heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "phenomenologically , one has to turn to some approximation or assumption for the hme calculation .",
    "the lepage - brodsky approach @xcite is usually applied to a hard scattering process , where a hadron transition matrix element is generally written as a convolution integral of hadron wave functions reflecting the nonperturbative contributions and hard scattering amplitudes containing perturbative contributions . in order to wipe out the endpoint singularities appearing in the collinear approximation @xcite and suppress the soft contributions , as it is argued with the pqcd approach @xcite , the transverse momentum @xmath56 of valence quarks should be retained and sudakov factor @xmath57 should be introduced for each of the wave functions . finally , the @xmath0 weak decay amplitude can be expressed as a multidimensional integral of many parts @xcite , including the hard effects enclosed by the wilson coefficients @xmath44 , the heavy quark decay amplitudes @xmath58 , and the universal wave functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a typical scale , @xmath62 is the momentum of a valence quark .      in the rest frame of the @xmath0 meson , the light - cone kinematic variables are defined as follows .",

    "( 2 ) the shape lines of das for the @xmath139 and @xmath140 mesons are symmetric versus @xmath113 , which agree basically with the postulated scenario that patrons share momentum fractions according to their masses .",

    "the followings are some comments .",
    "\\(1 ) because of the hierarchical relations between the ckm matrix elements @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170 , branching ratios for the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath171 , @xmath172 decays are generally an order of magnitude less than those for the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath173 , @xmath151 decays with the same charmonium in the final states , i.e. , @xmath174 @xmath175 due to the hierarchical relations between decay constants @xmath176 @xmath169 @xmath177 and @xmath178 @xmath169 @xmath179 , along with relatively compact phase spaces for final @xmath180 , @xmath181 states with respect to those for the @xmath182 , @xmath183 states , there are some hierarchical relations , i.e. , @xmath184 @xmath185 for the same final pseudoscalar meson @xmath4 .    in addition , due to the conservation of angular momentum , there are more wave amplitudes contributing to the @xmath150 @xmath1 @xmath152 decays than the only @xmath89-wave amplitudes contributing to the @xmath150 @xmath1 @xmath153 decays .",
    "so there are some hierarchical relations , i.e. , @xmath186 @xmath187 for the same final pseudoscalar meson @xmath4 .",
    "\\(2 ) the branching ratios of the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath152 , @xmath153 decays are several orders of magnitude less than the branching ratios of the @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath152 , @xmath153 decays @xcite .",
    "so , the possible influence from the @xmath0 meson decays could be safely neglected when the @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath152 , @xmath153 decays are studied experimentally . on the other hand , with the improvement of detection ability and analytical techniques , rare @xmath25 decay modes with branching ratio @xmath9 @xmath10 , such as the @xmath188 @xmath1 @xmath189 decay @xcite ,",

    "the possible background from the @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath173 decays might , in principle , be excluded from the invariant mass of final states .",
    "so , even given the detection efficiency , the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath8 decay is also measurable , although very challenging , at the future lhc experiments .     from different regions of @xmath194 ( abscissa axis ) , where the numbers above the histogram denote the percentage of the corresponding contributions.,scaledwidth=52.0% ]    \\(3 ) the spectator quarks in the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath84 and @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath85 transitions are the heavy charm quark .",
    "it is usually assumed that the charm quark in the @xmath0 meson and charmonium might be close to on - shell , and the gluons emitted or absorbed by the spectator quarks might be soft .",
    "it is natural to question the validity of perturbative calculation and the practicability of pqcd approach . in order to eliminate the doubts ,",
    "it is necessary to check how many shares come from the perturbative domain .",
    "the contributions to branching ratio @xmath195 from different @xmath194 region are displayed in fig.[fig : as ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that more than @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) contributions to branching ratio @xmath195 come from the @xmath194 @xmath198 @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) regions , which implies that the perturbative calculation with the pqcd approach is feasible and credible .",
    "the small wilson coefficient @xmath201 and the small coupling @xmath202 at a higher scale @xmath54 will account for the small percentage from the @xmath194 @xmath198 @xmath203 region .",
    "the tiny share from the @xmath194 @xmath204 @xmath138 region is caused by the serious suppression on soft contributions from many factors , such as sudakov factor , das for the @xmath0 meson and charmonium .",
    "in addition , a preferable convention to choose the scale as the largest one of all virtualities of internal particles [ see eq.([amp : tab ] ) and eq.([amp : tcd ] ) ] is employed to ensure the perturbative calculation with the pqcd approach .",

    "a global fit with more observables seems to be necessary . the first uncertainty from the typical scale @xmath54 might , in principle , be reduced by the inclusion of higher order corrections to hmes .",
    "the decay amplitudes are closely related with wave functions [ see eq.([hadronic ] ) ] , and parameters of @xmath167 and @xmath166 have much influence on wave functions used here .",
    "the third uncertainty arises mainly from the wolfenstein parameter @xmath127 , i.e. , @xmath205 @xmath9 6.4% . and",
    "a large uncertainty comes from the indefinitive decay width @xmath164 .",
    "the uncertainties from @xmath167 and @xmath166 , the ckm parameters , and @xmath164 are expected to reduce greatly through either the relative ratio of branching ratios or other observables , such as the polarization fractions @xmath206 @xmath5 @xmath207 .",
    "our studies show that the dominant contributions come from the factorizable topologies .",
    "there are large cancellations between the nonfactorizable contributions .",
