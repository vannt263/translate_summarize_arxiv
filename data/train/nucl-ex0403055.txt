    "the formation and study under laboratory conditions of this `` quark - gluon plasma '' ( qgp ) phase is one of the highest priorities in high - energy nuclear physics in the present day .",
    "several experimental results from the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) relativistic heavy - ion programme collected during the 1990 s in fixed - target experiments with center - of - mass energies @xmath2 20 gev have been interpreted , not without controversy , in terms of qgp formation  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "although several observations in central pb+pb collisions  @xcite are consistent with expected qgp signals , e.g. the `` anomalous '' suppression of charmonium states due to debye screening of the color potential in the plasma  @xcite ( see , however , also  @xcite ) , other expected signatures such as `` jet quenching '' due to parton energy loss in the dense deconfined medium  @xcite seem to be significatively absent from the data .",
    "in fact , high @xmath3 pion production in central a+a at cern - sps was found not to be suppressed but _ enhanced _ compared to production in free space  @xcite . such a `` cronin enhancement '' , observed earlier in p+a  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite collisions , is usually interpreted in terms of multiple initial - state parton scatterings which result in a broadening of the final @xmath3 spectra  @xcite . in contrast , high-@xmath3 hadro - production in central au+au collisions at @xmath9 130 gev  @xcite and 200 gev  @xcite at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has been found to be strongly suppressed ( by up to a factor of 45 ) compared to p+p collisions measured at the same @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the observed suppression at rhic is even more significant considering the fact that the `` default '' production at high @xmath3 in the `` cold '' nuclear environment of deuteron - nucleus reactions at collider energies is also cronin enhanced  @xcite .",
    "these results clearly indicate that final - state effects are responsible for the high @xmath3 deficit observed in central au+au .",
    "the difference between the _ suppressed _ rhic and _ enhanced _ sps hadro - production at large @xmath3 implies that there must exist an intermediate value of collision energies in nucleus - nucleus reactions at which final - state quenching starts to dominate over initial - state @xmath3 broadening .",
    "the search for the onset of high @xmath3 suppression is the main motivation behind the dedicated @xmath10 = 62.4 gev au+au run carried out at rhic in april 2004 .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite of parton propagation in a dense medium show that the induced parton energy loss is proportional to the initial gluon density ( @xmath11 ) in the system . in this context , the absence of suppression at cern - sps is surprising considering that experimental estimates of the initial energy density , based on the bjorken prescription  @xcite for a boost - invariant longitudinally expanding plasma , at a canonical thermalisation time of @xmath12  =  1  fm/@xmath1 , are on the order of @xmath13 3 gev/@xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15 5 gev/@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "such energy densities , both well above the critical value of @xmath160.7 gev/@xmath7 , would correspond to a ratio of parton rapidity densities ( @xmath17 for an ideal gas of quarks and gluons ) of @xmath160.68 between rhic and sps at @xmath12 = 1 fm/@xmath1 . since @xmath18 0.2 , one would accordingly expect suppression factors of the order @xmath19 0.3 assuming the same cronin @xmath3 broadening at rhic and sps ( see discussion later ) .",
    "this is in violent contradiction with the @xmath201 usually quoted in the literature .",
    "the usual explanations for the reported absence of suppression at sps involve short qgp lifetime  @xcite , domination of multiple soft collisions ( cronin effect ) over hard scatterings  @xcite , and modest amount of parton rescatterings  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we explore an alternative interpretation based on a thorough reanalysis of the p+p @xmath21+@xmath22 baseline spectrum used to determine the a+a nuclear modification factor at @xmath23 = 17.3 gev in  @xcite .",

    "second , wang&wang  @xcite have adopted a more complex power - law ansatz for the @xmath3 spectrum which describes the charged pion data at @xmath23 = 19.4 gev  @xcite , combined with a pqcd parton model calculation to scale the cross - section down to @xmath23 = 17.3 gev .",

    "the total lifetime of the strongly interacting system ( @xmath110 15  fm/@xmath1  @xcite ) is comparable to the time it takes a hard scattered parton with typical momentum @xmath69 = 4 ( 8) gev/@xmath1 to hadronize into a fully formed meson  @xcite : @xmath111 12 ( 25 ) fm/@xmath1 ( for a pion of radius @xmath112 0.8 fm  @xcite ) . in this context , the produced high - energy parton travels ( and loses energy ) first through a dense partonic system during @xmath113 and then , for a time @xmath114 , through a hadronic environment . in this second hadronic stage , inelastic scattering of the `` pre - hadron ''",
    "object with comover soft hadrons of the type described in  @xcite can also partially account for the suppression of the final high-@xmath3 inclusive spectra . in any case",
    ", it is reasonable to admit that the energy loss will be larger in the denser ( partonic ) phase than in the more rarefied hadronic one .",
    "we have reexamined high-@xmath3 ( @xmath0 2 gev/@xmath1 ) inclusive pion production in nucleus - nucleus reactions from cern - sps fixed - target experiments at center of mass energies around @xmath10 = 20 gev , and systematically compared them to the available proton - proton data in the same range of collision energies per nucleon - nucleon pair .",
    "in contrast to what has been usually considered so far , we conclude that there is no indication of a strong @xmath3 broadening ( cronin enhancement ) in the high-@xmath3 yields measured in central pb+pb , pb+au and s+au reactions . instead , the data appear to be consistent within errors with the perturbative expectations of scaling with the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the peripheral yields , however , are still found to be cronin enhanced . these facts , together with the complementary observation that high-@xmath3 pion yields in head - on ( 01% most central ) pb+pb reactions are suppressed by a factor of @xmath161.6 @xmath6 0.6 compared to p+p collisions , is consistent with a moderate amount of final - state quenching of the hard scattered partons traversing the dense system produced in the course of the most central heavy - ion reactions at sps .",
    "theoretical calculations of parton energy loss in an expanding deconfined medium require initial gluon rapidity densities of the order @xmath115 600 to reproduce the observed yields , consistent with estimations of the bjorken energy densities attained in the reactions .",
    "additionally , we have provided arguments based on hadronization time estimates that support the idea that the hard scattered partons must lose their energy in the dense partonic _ and _ hadronic phases of the reaction .",
    "the 2004 @xmath10 = 62.4 gev au+au run at rhic will undoubtedly help to clarify the `` excitation function '' evolution of the high-@xmath3 hadron suppression observed in high energy nucleus - nucleus reactions .",
    "the discussion presented here highlights the importance of a concurrent and precise measurement of the high-@xmath3 production yields in baseline p+p collisions at the same center - of - mass energies as the nucleus - nucleus data . _",
    "note added : preliminary rhic results from au+au reactions at @xmath10 = 62.4 gev , obtained after submission of this letter , indicate that high @xmath3 hadron production per @xmath4 collision is also significantly reduced ( by up to a factor of @xmath163 ) in central au+au compared to p+p collisions at these energies .",
    "these results are consistent with the indications of moderate high @xmath3 suppression in heavy - ion reactions at lower sps energies , discussed here . _",
    "the author would like to thank k.  reygers , t.  peitzmann and j.  bielcikova for providing the wa98 , wa80 and ceres data respectively and for helpful discussions , as well as to c.  blume and p.  stankus for valuable comments .",
    "i am indebted to p.  stankus for a careful reading of a previous version of this paper , as well as to i.  vitev for making available his parton energy loss calculations and for useful remarks .",
