    "in this paper we investigate spherically symmetric equilibrium states of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "these equations describe a collisionless gas of particles that interact by the newtonian gravitational field they generate collectively .",
    "examples of systems that can be modelled by these equations are ensembles of stars in e.g. , a galaxy , a globular cluster or an ensemble of galaxies in a rich cluster  @xcite .    a collisionless gas is characterized by the phase space mass density distribution @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and where @xmath2 is the mass contained in the phase space volume element @xmath3 at @xmath4 .",
    "the spatial mass density is given by @xmath5 the newtonian potential @xmath6 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath7 . under the assumption that @xmath6 tends to zero at infinity and with suitable fall - off and regularity conditions on the function @xmath8",
    "there is a unique potential @xmath9 for a given density @xmath8 .",
    "it is assumed in the following that the function @xmath10 is non - negative and spherically symmetric , i.e. , that it is invariant under simultaneous rotations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath10 is inherited by @xmath8 and @xmath6 . under these conditions",
    "the poisson equation can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and where the gravitational constant has been set to @xmath16 .",
    "as the distribution function of a collisionless gas the function @xmath10 satisfies the vlasov equation . the following is concerned with time - independent solutions and in that case the vlasov equation takes the form @xmath17 equations ( [ density ] ) , ( [ poisson ] ) and ( [ vlasov ] ) constitute the vlasov - poisson system in the time - independent , spherically symmetric case . a definition which is useful when",
    "comparing models with collisionless matter and models in which the matter is described by a fluid is the radial pressure defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radial velocity of a particle .    for a time - independent spherically symmetric solution of the vlasov - poisson system",
    "the distribution function depends only on the energy per unit mass and particle @xmath20 and the squared magnitude of the angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "this statement was first proved in  @xcite under appropriate regularity assumptions was interpreted as a number density , but this leads to the same mathematical problem as studied here . ] ; it belongs to a class of statements known as jeans theorems in the astrophysical literature , cf .",
    "conversely , any function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfies the vlasov equation .",
    "now let @xmath24 $ ] denote the radius of support of the system , i.e. , @xmath25 because of physical applications , we are interested in systems in equilibrium that have finite total mass .",
    "it follows from theorem 2.1 of @xcite that the monotonically increasing potential satisfies @xmath26 and that there is a cut - off energy @xmath27 such that @xmath28 when @xmath29 .",
    "we now introduce the definitions @xmath30 where @xmath31 can be interpreted as a relative potential , and @xmath32 as the binding energy per unit mass for each particle . when @xmath33 , then @xmath34 , @xmath35 , while @xmath32 and @xmath31 are zero at the boundary @xmath36 of the system .    in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath23 ,",
    "the mass density takes the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the mass of the system inside the radius @xmath39 is determined by @xmath40 and thus @xmath41 , assuming that there is no central point mass . as a consequence poisson s equation takes the form @xmath42 , which leads to @xmath43 hence @xmath44 and @xmath6 are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath39 while @xmath31 is monotonically decreasing .    given a suitable choice of the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath32 and @xmath23 the existence of corresponding global solutions with regular potential",
    "can be shown @xcite .",
    "what is much harder is to decide whether these solutions satisfy the condition that the total mass is finite .",
    "one approach to this , which will be pursued in the following , is to try to prove the stronger statement that the radius of the support is finite . in @xcite finiteness of the radius",
    "was proved for a large class of solutions , which will be described in section [ distf ] .",
    "many models used in the astrophysical literature are covered by the results of @xcite , but some are not . motivated in part by this we consider a wider class of models in the following and greatly extend the domain of validity of the results of @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions used in @xcite concerned the behaviour of @xmath10 near @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that if more general classes of solutions are to be handled it is often necessary to make assumptions concerning high values of @xmath32 as well .",
    "the mathematical problem to be solved is to obtain information on the qualitative behaviour of solutions of a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the technique which allows us to go beyond what was done previously is to reformulate the problem using new variables , since this enables us to apply the theory of dynamical systems to the resulting equations .",
    "the geometrical intuition resulting from the dynamical systems formulation played an important role in the development of the proofs .",
    "the new variables are obtained by analogy with an approach of heinzle and uggla @xcite to the euler - poisson system describing a self - gravitating fluid .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ distf ] we define and describe the class of distribution functions we study in this article . for these distribution functions , in section  [ dyn ] , we reformulate the static vlasov - poisson system as a three - dimensional system of autonomous differential equations on a state space with compact closure . the system is subsequently analysed in section  [ dynamicalsystemsanalysis ] by using methods from the theory of dynamical systems ; in particular , functions that are monotone along solutions of the dynamical system play a key role . based on the results of section  [ dynamicalsystemsanalysis ] ,",
    "the main theorems are stated and proved in section  [ finitenessofradius ] : we formulate conditions that guarantee finiteness of the radius @xmath36 of solutions .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ outlook ] with some examples and remarks , and give an outlook on further applications of the techniques developed here .",
    "there exists a type of distribution functions that can be said to be among the mathematically simplest , the `` generalized polytropes '' @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constants with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . under these conditions",
    "the mass density of these models is well - defined , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . the models  ( [ generalizedpolytropes ] ) exhibit invariance under scale transformations ( of space and time ) , which corresponds to a symmetry of the vlasov - poisson equation ; this leads to mathematical simplification .",
    "in particular , scale invariance gives rise to so - called homology invariants ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , i.e. , quantities that are invariant under scalings , which are adapted to the symmetries of the problem .",
    "the use of homology invariants turns out to be crucial for our considerations .",
    "the mathematical analysis of static spherically symmetric solutions in the generalized polytropic case reduces to that of an ordinary differential equation known as the emden - fowler equation .",
    "this equation has a long history intertwining mathematics and astrophysics which we have not attempted to reconstruct .",
    "we note only that fowler @xcite introduced this equation as a mathematical generalization of the emden equation , the case @xmath54 , whose importance in the theory of stellar structure was well - known .",
    "further early references can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it appears that the emden - fowler equation was introduced independently much later by hnon @xcite , who derived it from a distribution function of the form introduced above and coined the term generalized polytropes .    in this paper",
    "we discuss distribution functions that naturally generalize the polytropes : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a non - negative function which is measurable , bounded on compact subsets of the interval @xmath57 , and integrable on @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "then , provided that @xmath51 , distribution functions of the type  ( [ fphi ] ) give rise to a mass density @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is defined as @xmath62 and where @xmath63 .",
    "the radial pressure of the models  ( [ fphi ] ) is given by @xmath64 .",
    "it is natural to define a polytropic index function @xmath65 according to @xmath66 for the special case of the generalized polytrope @xmath67 the function @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 , and therefore @xmath65 becomes a constant , @xmath70 .",
    "we call distributions that lead to a ( bounded ) function @xmath65 and satisfy @xmath71 for @xmath72 asymptotically polytropic in the low @xmath31 regime . distribution functions of this type with @xmath73 were treated in @xcite .",
    "one of the main aims of the present work is to treat more general distribution functions since this is needed for applications .",
    "if it is assumed in addition that @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 for some @xmath76 on a neighbourhood of @xmath77 , then @xmath68 is continuous for @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and thus @xmath65 is continuous for all @xmath35 ; compare with the results of  @xcite . for later purposes we require @xmath65 to be of class @xmath81 . in order to achieve this",
    "we assume that @xmath74 is @xmath82 such that @xmath83 is bounded on compact subsets of @xmath57 and @xmath84 for some @xmath85 on a neighbourhood of @xmath77 .",
    "then it can be shown that @xmath68 is @xmath86 for @xmath87 and hence that @xmath65 is @xmath81 , provided that @xmath88 .",
    "for the proofs , and a discussion of the case @xmath89 , see appendix  [ diffassumptions ] .",
    "the regularity conditions on @xmath74 stated above will be assumed from now on .",
    "the main idea of this work is to reformulate the static vlasov - poisson system ,    [ vpsys ] @xmath90    cf .",
    "( [ mprime ] ) ,  ( [ etaprime ] ) , as a three - dimensional system of autonomous first order ordinary differential equations on a region with compact closure .    the system  ( [ vpsys ] ) becomes an autonomous system of equations by regarding @xmath39 as a supplementary dependent variable and introducing a new independent variable @xmath91 . as the next step",
    "we perform a transformation of variables from @xmath92 to two dimensionless variables @xmath93 note that @xmath94 . using the fact that @xmath51 it is possible to compute @xmath39 in terms of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath44 can be computed in terms of those variables and so the transformation is invertible for @xmath78 .    introducing @xmath97 as a new independent variable and converting the system  ( [ vpsys ] ) to the new variables we obtain    [ uqomegaeq ] @xmath98    we proceed by defining bounded variables in order to obtain a dynamical system on a bounded state space . recall that @xmath99 and define bounded variables @xmath100 , @xmath101 , by @xmath102 if a solution @xmath103 is given , a new independent variable @xmath104 can be introduced by the relation @xmath105 .",

    "we observe that the side faces are invariant subspaces of the system , moreover , they contain the attracting sets for any orbit in the state space , as discussed in the next section . note that a solution of ( [ uqomega ] ) which is global in @xmath104 need neither correspond to a solution of ( [ uqomegaeq ] ) which is global in @xmath113 , nor to a solution of ( [ vpsys ] ) which is global in @xmath114 .    for generalized polytropes @xmath115 , and the equation for @xmath110 decouples from the equations for @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the variables @xmath111 , @xmath112 are homology invariants .",
