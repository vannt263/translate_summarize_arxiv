    "the question is how well can effective interactions , which are adjusted to global properties of spherical closed shell nuclei , describe the structure of nuclei far from stability , or predict new phenomena in nuclei with extreme isospin values .",

    "although the nl1 effective force strongly over binds these nuclei , i.e. the calculated binding energies are @xmath51 mev larger than the empirical ones , nevertheless detailed predictions were made for ground state deformations and relative positions of coexisting minima , including the excitation energies of superdeformed states . most of these results , as pointed out in ref .",

    "the differences of the intrinsic energies of the lowest prolate and oblate states were also in agreement with experimental data .",
    "the gap parameters were not kept constant in each nucleus , rather they were determined in a self - consistent way from a monopole force with constant strength parameter @xmath53 .",
    "this leads to deformation dependent pairing gaps .",
    "in particular , for the oblate ground states the proton pairing gaps vanish , while the neutron pairing gap is a factor two larger than the average value @xmath54 . since the calculated ground - state properties are very sensitive to both pairing and deformation effects , it was argued  @xcite that a unified and self - consistent framework , i.e. the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model , might be more appropriate for the study of neutron - deficient nuclei in this mass region .",
    "it is not only the treatment of pairing which makes it difficult to assess the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , but also the large deviations of the calculated binding energies from the experimental values .",
    "the relative positions of prolate and oblate minima differ by only @xmath55 mev in most cases , while the calculated binding energies are more than 10 mev too large .",
    "this is , of course , caused by the well known fact that the parameter set nl1 fails to reproduce nuclear binding energies far from stability .    in this work",
    "we calculate ground state properties of neutron - deficient hg and pb nuclei in the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov framework . in most applications of the rhb model",
    "we have used the nl3 effective interaction  @xcite in the particle - hole channel , and pairing correlations were described by the pairing part of the finite range gogny interaction d1s  @xcite .",
    "this force has been very carefully adjusted to pairing properties of finite nuclei all over the periodic table . in particular ,",
    "the basic advantage of the gogny force is the finite range , which automatically guarantees a proper cut - off in momentum space .",

    "a recent systematic theoretical study of ground - state properties of more than 1300 even - even isotopes has shown very good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , in the analysis of the @xmath6 shell closure in neutron - deficient pb isotopes  @xcite , it was noted that rmf+bcs calculations with the nl3 interaction predict deformed ground states for several pb nuclei .    in fig .",

    "model calculations predict a spherical ground state for @xmath64hg and an almost spherical , but slightly oblate ground state for @xmath65hg . with increasing neutron number",
    "the spherical state evolves into an oblate minimum , and a pronounced minimum develops on the prolate side .",
    "the positions of the minima , @xmath66 on the oblate side , and @xmath67 for the prolate minimum , agree well with the values calculated by nazarewicz  @xcite using the nilsson - strutinsky approach .",
    "the problem is , however , the relative excitation energies . for the nl3+d1s effective interaction",
    "the prolate minimum is the ground state for @xmath68hg .",
    "the calculated ground states are oblate for @xmath69hg .",
    "these results are at variance with experimental data : all hg isotopes with @xmath70 have oblate ground states , the prolate minimum is estimated at @xmath71 kev above the ground state  @xcite . if the nl1 effective interaction is used in the @xmath72 channel , we find that the oblate minima are always lower , and this is similar to the result obtained with the rmf+bcs calculation of ref .",
    "the calculated binding energies , however , are on the average more than 10 mev larger than the experimental ones .",
    "is it then possible to construct a relativistic effective interaction which will consistently describe the ground state properties of neutron - rich nuclei in this mass region ?",
    "the motivation , of course , is not just to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "the real question is whether effective mean - field interactions can be accurately extrapolated from stable nuclei to isotopes with extreme isospin values and to the drip lines . in the particular example considered in the present study ,",
    "the quantitative description of coexisting spherical , oblate and prolate minima is , of course , beyond the mean - field approach .",
    "a detailed analysis of coexisting shapes necessitates the use of models which can account for configuration mixing effects .",
    "however , a consistent description of ground states should be possible in the relativistic mean - field framework , even if their properties are affected by correlations not explicitly included in the model . in a series of recent papers ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , furnstahl and serot have argued that relativistic mean - field models should be considered as approximate implementations of the kohn - sham density functional theory , with local scalar and vector fields appearing in the role of relativistic kohn - sham potentials .",
    "the mean - field models approximate the exact energy functional of the ground state density of a many - nucleon system , which includes all higher - order correlations , using powers of auxiliary meson fields or nucleon densities .    in the recent analysis of the phenomenon of shape coexistence within the non - relativistic self - consistent hartree - fock method and the nuclear shell model  @xcite",
    ", it was emphasized that the sizes of spherical magic and semi - magic gaps in the single - nucleon spectrum determine the relative positions of many - particle many - hole intruder configurations with respect to the ground state .",
    "the spherical gaps are the main factor that determines the relative excitation energies of coexisting minima based on different intruder configurations .",
    "the relative distance between the individual shells also determines the effective strength of the quadrupole field  @xcite .",
    "the spherical proton @xmath6 shell closure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figc ] , where we display the last four occupied and the first three unoccupied proton single - particle states in @xmath73pb . the experimental levels in the first column are from ref .",
    "the levels in the second , third and fourth columns are calculated in the rhb model with the effective interactions nl1 , nl - sc , and nl3 , respectively .",
    "comparing the magic gaps @xmath74 , one notices that the value calculated with the nl3 effective interaction is much smaller than the empirical gap .",
    "this explains why several neutron - deficient pb isotopes , calculated with the nl3 interaction , have deformed ground states .",
    "the magic gap in the proton spectrum calculated with nl1 , on the other hand , is somewhat larger than the empirical value .",
    "the spectrum of proton occupied states is , however , more bound and the total binding energies calculated with nl1 do not compare well with the experimental masses of lighter pb isotopes .",
    "we have tried , therefore , to construct a new effective interaction which , on one hand , preserves the good properties of nl3 ( binding energies , charge radii , isotopic shifts ) , but at the same time takes into account the gap between the last occupied and the first unoccupied major spherical shells .",
    "the result is shown in the third column nl - sc of fig .",
    "[ figc ] ( sc for shape coexistence ) .",
    "there are several comments which should be made at this point .",
    "first , the nl - sc interaction has been constructed by starting from the standard nl1 parameterization , and changing the parameters towards nl3 . while the masses and coupling constants of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are those of nl1 , the parameters of the non - linear @xmath9-terms and , especially important for the binding energies of isotopes with small n / z , the coupling constant of the @xmath11 meson , are very close to the nl3 parameter set .",
    "it should also be emphasized that , although in the construction of the nl - sc interaction we paid particular attention to the pt - hg - pb region , the parameters were , as usual , checked to reproduce a set of ground state data of about ten spherical nuclei from different mass regions .",
    "for nuclei with @xmath75 the calculated @xmath76 per datum is comparable to the one obtained with the standard nl3 interaction .",
    "the ground state properties of light nuclei calculated with nl - sc , on the other hand , are not as good as with nl3 and therefore we do not regard nl - sc as a new general effective relativistic mean field interaction .",
    "nl - sc has been specifically tailored to illustrate the problem considered in the present analysis .",
    "second , the construction of the nl - sc interaction goes beyond the standard mean - field approach , in the sense that the parameters of the mean - field functional depend not only on the ground - state density , i.e. on the occupied states , but implicitly also on the relative position of the unoccupied spherical shells . in order to be consistent with the mean field approach ,",
    "the calculated spherical gap should be larger than the empirical value .",
    "it is well known that the coupling of single particle states to collective vibrations increases the effective mass in the vicinity of the fermi level , and this effect decreases the gap between occupied and unoccupied shells .",
    "we have recently shown how to include the particle - vibration coupling in the self - consistent relativistic mean - field framework  @xcite , but the present analysis does not consider this effect . in ref .  @xcite it was emphasized that the proper treatment of pairing and zero - point correlations , vibrational and rotational , is crucial for detailed predictions of shape coexistence effects . and while we treat pairing and mean - field correlations in the unified hartree - bogoliubov framework , no attempt is made to explicitly include zero - point energy corrections .",
    "since in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the sum of rotational and vibrational zero - point energy corrections is approximately constant as function of deformation for a given nucleus , we assume that these corrections can be absorbed in the parameters of an effective interaction adjusted to reproduce binding energies , at least in a limited mass region . in any case , since the effective interaction nl - sc is adjusted to reproduce the spherical proton shell gap at @xmath6 , one can not really expect that it accurately describes the ground state shapes of nuclei in other ( z , n ) regions characterized by shape coexistence .    in figs .",
    "[ figd ] and [ fige ] we display the binding energies per nucleon of even - a hg and pb isotopes , respectively , calculated in the rhb model with the mean - field effective interactions nl1 , nl3 , and nl - sc , and with the gogny d1s interaction in the pairing channel . the theoretical binding energies are compared with the empirical values from ref .",
    "both the nl3 and the nl - sc interactions reproduce in detail the mass dependence of the binding energies of pb isotopes , while the nl1 interaction strongly over binds the nuclei below @xmath73pb .",
    "the reason is the much larger value of the @xmath11 meson coupling constant .",
    "essentially identical binding energies are calculated with all three forces for nuclei above @xmath73pb .",
    "a similar effect is observed for the hg isotopes in fig .",
    "while nl3 and nl - sc reproduce much better the empirical data for the neutron - deficient hg isotopes , comparable results are obtained with all three interactions for @xmath77 .",
    "a remarkable success of relativistic mean field models was the realization that , because of the intrinsic isospin dependence of the effective single - nucleon spin - orbit potential , they naturally reproduce the anomalous charge isotope shifts  @xcite .",
    "the well known example of the anomalous kink in the isotope shifts of pb isotopes is shown in fig .",
    "the results of rhb calculations with the nl1 , nl3 , and nl - sc effective interactions , and with the gogny d1s interaction in the pairing channel , are compared with experimental data from ref .",
    "while all three forces reproduce the general trend of isotope shifts and the kink at @xmath73pb , this effect is more pronounced for nl1 and nl3 .",
    "the experimental data are best reproduced by the nl - sc interaction .",
    "the rhb theoretical values for the charge isotope shifts of even - a hg isotopes are compared with the experimental data  @xcite in fig .",
    "the large discrepancy between data and the values calculated with nl3 for @xmath78 , simply reflects the fact that this interaction predicts the wrong sign for the ground state deformations of neutron - deficient hg nuclei . the interactions nl1 and nl - sc reproduce the experimental data , although the agreement is not as good as in the case of pb isotopes .    in fig .",
    "[ figh ] we plot the differences between the binding energies of prolate and oblate minima in even - a @xmath52hg isotopes .",
    "the values calculated with the nl1 , nl3 , and nl - sc effective interactions are shown in comparison with the empirical data  @xcite . as it was already shown in fig .",
    "[ figb ] , prolate ground states are calculated with the nl3 interaction .",
    "the nl1 and nl - sc interactions , on the other hand , reproduce the relative positions of the prolate and oblate minima .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that the total binding energies calculated with nl1 are , on the average , more than 10 mev too large . the rhb model with the nl - sc interaction in the @xmath72 channel and",
    "with the gogny d1s interaction in the @xmath79 channel , provides a consistent description for the ground state properties of neutron - deficient nuclei in the pt - hg - pb region ( binding energies , radii , ground state deformations ) .",
    "we should emphasize that nl - sc was not adjusted to reproduce the relative excitation energies of the prolate minima in hg nuclei .",
    "however , the fact that the calculated relative positions of prolate and oblate minima agree with the empirical values , might indicate that configuration mixing effects are not very important in these nuclei .",
    "this work presents an analysis of ground - state properties of neutron - deficient hg and pb isotopes in the framework of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model . in the last couple of years",
    "this model has been very successfully applied in the description of nuclear structure phenomena in medium - heavy and heavy exotic nuclei far from the valley of @xmath0- stability and of the physics of the drip lines .",
    "it is still a very much open problem , however , how far from stability can one apply relativistic effective interactions which have been adjusted to global properties of a small number of spherical closed shell nuclei . can these interactions accurately describe experimentally known properties and predict new structure phenomena in exotic nuclei far from stability ?",
    "one of the testing grounds of nuclear structure models is their ability to describe shape coexistence phenomena in soft nuclei . in the present study ,",
    "in particular , we have analyzed the results of relativistic mean - field calculations in the region of neutron deficient pt - hg - pb nuclei .",
    "standard relativistic interactions , adjusted to ground state properties of stable nuclei , do not reproduce the empirical ground state shapes of neutron deficient nuclei in this mass region .",
    "we have shown , however , that effective interactions can be constructed , which consistently describe binding energies , charge radii , ground state quadrupole deformations and , at least qualitatively , the relative positions of coexisting minima in hg and pb isotopic chains . in adjusting the parameters of such an interaction , in addition to the usual experimental data on ground states of stable nuclei , also the sizes of spherical gaps in the single - nucleon spectra have to be taken into account .",
    "the spherical magic and semi - magic gaps determine the relative excitation energies of coexisting minima based on different intruder configurations .",
    "although a quantitative analysis of shape coexistence phenomena goes beyond the mean - field approach , a consistent description of ground states is possible in the relativistic mean - field framework .",
