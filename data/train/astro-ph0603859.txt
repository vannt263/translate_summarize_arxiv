    "in addition the frequency dependence of _ the spot _ was shown to be extremely flat . even considering large errors in the foreground estimation it was not possible to explain the non - gaussian properties of _ the spot_.    cjt applied higher criticism statistics ( hereafter hc ) to the 1year maps after convolving them with the smhw .",
    "this method provided a direct detection of _ the spot_. the hc values appeared to be higher than 99% of the gaussian simulations .",

    "up to date there are no further evidences of the validity of any of the above suggested explanations .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",

    "the wmap data are provided at five frequency - bands , namely k  band ( 22.8 ghz , one receiver ) , ka  band ( 33.0 ghz , one receiver ) , q  band ( 40.7 ghz , two receivers ) , v  band ( 60.8 ghz , two receivers ) and w  band ( 93.5 ghz , four receivers ) .",
    "foreground cleaned maps for the q , v , and w channels are also available at the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) web site .",
    "most of the 1year gaussianity analyses were performed using the wmap combined , foreground cleaned q  v  w map ( hereafter wcm ; see bennett et al .",
    "cmb is the dominant signal at these bands and noise properties are well defined for this map .",
    "the de - biased internal linear combination map , ( dilc ) proposed by the wmap team , estimates the cmb on the whole sky .",
    "however its noise properties are complicated and regions close to the galactic plane will be highly contaminated by foregrounds .",
    "chiang , naselsky & coles ( 2006 ) find evidences for the foreground contamination of the dilc .",
    "therefore we will still use the more reliable wcm in the 3year data analysis .",
    "hinshaw et al . ( 2006 ) describe some changes in the 3year temperature analysis with respect to the 1year one . coadding the three years of observations",
    "reduces the instrumental noise .",
    "the 3year maps have @xmath7 times lower variance .",
    "refinements in gain calibration and beam response models have been implemented and a new foreground reduction technique has been used .",
    "the latter seems to provide a better correction than the one applied to the first year data . as discussed in c06",
    "the galactic foreground estimation is a very important issue in gaussianity analyses .",

    "( 2003b ) have not been modified , except for the inclusion of 81 new point sources in the kp0 mask .",
    "this mask excludes the highly contaminated pixels close to the galactic plane .    despite these changes",
    "the 3year maps have been found to be consistent with the 1year maps by the wmap team .",
    "v04 and c05 performed a very careful analysis in order to study the power spectrum and noise dependence of the kurtosis and cold area estimators .",
    "considering different power spectra within the 1@xmath8 error band of the 1year data , the differences in the significance of the kurtosis were found to be negligible ( see figure 11 in v04 ) .",
    "the area of a particular spot was neither affected by the power spectrum ( see section 5.3 in c05 ) .",
    "the results were almost noise independent .",
    "the convolution with the smhw reduces considerably the noise contribution .",
    "even if similar results are expected , we perform 10000 gaussian simulations of the 3year coadded data following the same steps as for the 1year simulations .",
    "the only differences between the 3year and the 1year simulations are a lower noise contribution and a very slight variation in the power spectrum used to generate the simulations . for a detailed description of the simulation pipeline ,",
    "see section 2 of v04 .",
    "we will use all these maps in the healpix pixelisation scheme ( grski et al .",
    "2005 ) with resolution parameter nside = 256 .",
    "our aim in this section is to repeat the same tests performed in v04 , c05 , cjt and c06 but with the 3year data",
    ". then we will compare the new results to the old ones .",
    "one can see the region of _ the spot _ in real and wavelet space at scale @xmath4 for both releases of the wmap data in figure  [ fig : image ] . in real space",
    "the 3year data image appears clearly less noisy , whereas the wavelet space images present only very small differences .    in v04 ,",
    "data and simulations were convolved with the smhw at 15 scales , namely ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 arcmin ) . the smhw optimally enhances some non - gaussian signatures on the sphere ( martnez  gonzlez et al .",

    "the data are found to be compatible with gaussian predictions    in the following subsections we will give the upper tail probabilities of the data at one particular scale .",

    "scale 0 corresponds to real space .",
    "the acceptance intervals given by the simulations will be plotted in the same way in all figures : the 32% interval corresponds to the inner band , the 5% interval to the middle band and the 1% acceptance interval , to the outer one .",
    "as expected , the acceptance intervals remain almost unchanged with respect to those obtained from 1year simulations .",
    "this will happen as well for all the other estimators .",
    "the 3year kurtosis values follow the same pattern as the 1year ones , confirming the initial results .",

    "the kurtosis value of the 1year data increases @xmath37 .",
    "this may be due to the new foreground reduction technique . as expected the noise reduction due to coadding the three years of observations , implies a much lower increase in the kurtosis , since the noise contribution in wavelet space is very small .",

    "moreover , the statistic provides a direct method to locate these extreme observations by means of hc values calculated at every individual data point .    for a set of @xmath39 individual observations",

    "circles denote the results obtained from the 3year wcm , asterisks those from the 1year wcm and the bands represent the acceptance intervals .",
    "as one can see in the figure , the data in wavelet space are not compatible with gaussian predictions at scales @xmath45 and @xmath36 at the @xmath52 c.l .",
    "this is in agreement with the result obtained by cjt for the 1year wmap data although there the hc values at scale @xmath45 were just below the @xmath52 c.l .",
    "the upper tail probabilities for the 1year and 3year maximum hc values at scale @xmath36 , are 0.56% and 0.36% respectively . the map of hc values at scale @xmath36 is presented in figure  [ fig : hc_2 ] .",
    "it is clear that the pixels responsible for the detected deviation from gaussianity are located at the position of _ the spot_. convolution with the wavelet causes the observed ring structure in the hc map .",
    "figure  [ fig : hc_3 ] shows a blowout image of _ the spot _ as it appears at scale @xmath36 in the wavelet map and in the hc map .",
    "in the previous section , the upper tail probabilities of each estimator at scale @xmath36 were given .",
    "all the considered estimators showed the lowest upper tail probability at scale @xmath36 .",
    "however these are not rigorous measures of the significance of _ the spot _ , since the number of performed tests is not taken into account . in this section",
    "we will recalculate the @xmath31-value of the deviation in the kurtosis found by v04 and discuss the issue of _ a posteriori _ significances .",
    "when an anomaly is detected in a data set following a blind approach , usually several additional tests are performed afterwards to further characterize the anomaly . in most of these cases ,",
    "the only reason these tests have been performed is the previous finding of the initial anomaly .",
    "if another anomaly would have been detected , other followup tests would have been performed .",
    "hence these followup tests have not been performed blindly and should not be taken into account to calculate the significance of the initial detection .",
    "this issue was already discussed in c06 and mcewen et al .",
    "both papers recalculated the significance of the excess of kurtosis in the 1year wcm found by v04 .",
    "the excess of kurtosis was found performing a blind test , since no model was used and no previous findings conditioned the choice of the scales . since 15 wavelet scales and two estimators ( skewness and kurtosis ) were considered , a total sum of 30 tests were performed .",
    "three of these tests detected a strong deviation from gaussianity .",
    "scales @xmath38 , @xmath45 and @xmath36 presented upper tail probabilities 0.67% , 0.40% and 0.38% in the 1year data .",
    "this fact was taken into account in c06 , but it was not by mcewen et al .",
    "the latter searched through the simulations in order to find how many of them showed a higher or equal deviation than the maximum deviation of the data , ignoring that the data showed a high deviation at two adjacent scales .",
    "the @xmath31-value found in this way was 4.97% whereas c06 obtained 1.91% taking into account that the data deviate at three consecutive scales .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , when both galactic hemispheres were considered independently , c06 found a @xmath31-value of 0.69% , although this could be considered as a followup test .",
    "some readers could find that the three - consecutive - scales criterion is an _ a posteriori _ choice since we look first at the data and given that they deviate at three consecutive scales , we then calculate from the simulations how probable this is .",
    "therefore we should consider a new test which eliminates this _ a posteriori _ choice .",
    "we fix _ a priori _ a significance level which is the 1% acceptance interval given in all figures , and count for each estimator ( skewness and kurtosis ) how many scales lie outside , no matter if they are consecutive or not .",
    "then we search through the simulations how many show at least that many scales outside the 1% acceptance interval as the data .    applying this test to the 3year wcm",
    ", we find that scales @xmath45 and @xmath36 lie outside the 1% acceptance interval and scale @xmath38 lies on the border for the kurtosis estimator as can be seen in figure  [ fig : kurtosis ] . searching through the simulations how many deviate in three scales either in the skewness or in the kurtosis estimator , we find a @xmath31-value of 1.85% , which is still below the @xmath31-value obtained for the 1year data with the three - consecutive - scales criterion .",
    "as already discussed we should not include the followup tests in a rigorous significance analysis .",
    "however it is difficult to assess if some of these tests would have been performed or not without the first finding of v04 .",
    "in fact , the area and maxima analyses are very intuitive and simple .",
    "if v04 had performed their blind analysis on those estimators instead of using skewness and kurtosis , then the significance would be different .",
    "we should distinguish between those tests which are clearly followup tests , because the only reason they have been performed is the initial detection , and other tests which just have been performed after the initial detection , but could have been performed before .",
    "hence we apply our new robustness test to kurtosis , max , area at thresholds 3.0 and 4.0 and higher criticism separately .",
    "note that whereas the first two estimators are two - sided , the area and higher criticism are one sided estimators .",
    "the @xmath31-values obtained in this way are listed in table  [ table : pvalues ] .",
    "the kurtosis and area at threshold 4.0 show @xmath31-values around 1% , higher criticism and area at threshold 3.0 around 3% . on the contrary",
    "the max estimator does not show a significant deviation from gaussianity according to this robustness test .",
    "ccc kurtosis & 0.86% + skewness + kurtosis & 1.85% + max & 11.64% + area 3.0 & 3.27% + area 4.0 & 1.09% + higher criticism & 3.48% +    the most conservative and reliable value is the 1.85% figure since it is not suspicious of being obtained through _ a posteriori _ analyses .",
    "nevertheless it is still noticeable that the followup tests performed in c05 , c06 , cjt and in the present paper , confirm the initial finding with a very similar significance .",
    "even if strictly speaking these should not be taken into account for establishing the significance of _ the spot _ , they confirm the robustness of the detection .    .",

    "a flat frequency dependence is characteristic of cmb , whereas other emissions such as galactic foregrounds show a strong frequency dependence .",
    "figure  [ fig : kurt_qvw ] shows that the kurtosis has almost identical values at the three foreground cleaned channels , namely q , v and w. same behaviour was observed in the 1year data ( see figure 7 in c06 ) .",
    "strong frequency dependent foreground emissions are unlikely to produce the detected excess of kurtosis .",
    "the frequency dependence of the temperature at the center of _ the spot _ , i.e. at the pixel where the temperature of _ the spot _ is minimum in the wcm map , is presented in figure  [ fig : t_freq ] .",
    "the error bars of the 1year data have been estimated performing 1000 noise simulations as explained in section 5.1 of c06 .",
    "as the noise variance is @xmath7 times lower in the 3year data , we estimate the new error bars simply by dividing the old ones by @xmath53 . no frequency dependence is found for the new data set in agreement with the results for the 1year data .",
    "@xmath30 , area and hc values at different frequencies ( see figure  [ fig : max_freq ] , figure  [ fig : area_freq ] and figure  [ fig : hc_freq ] ) show a very low relative variation compared to the 3year wcm .",
    "all these results confirm the analysis performed in section 5 of c06 where the data were found to fit a flat cmb spectrum .",
    "the present analysis confirms the disagreement between the conclusions of c06 and those of the work of liu & zhang ( 2005 ) where galactic foregrounds were considered to be the most likely source for non - gaussian features found with spherical wavelets .",
    "spergel et al . ( 2006 ) enumerate several reasons to be cautious about the different anomalies found in the wmap data : galactic foregrounds or noise could be generating the non - gaussianity , and in addition most of the claimed detections are based on _ a posteriori _ statistics . also spatial variations of the noise variance and @xmath54 noise could affect some of the perfomed analyses .",
    "they suggest several tests to be done using difference maps ( year 1 - year 2 , year 2 - year 3 , etc . ) and multi - frequency data .",
    "we have tried to address all those points for _ the spot_. the _ a posteriori _ analysis is one of the most important issues raised by spergel et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , since it is very difficult to get completely rid of it .",
    "most analyses perform many tests and it is not easy to assess how many of them are followup tests and which is the probability of finding an anomaly by chance . as discussed in section 4 a very careful analysis shows that _ the spot _ remains statistically significant at least at the 98% confidence level , without using any _ a posteriori _ statistics .",
    "in addition c06 proved that _ the spot _ remained highly significant no matter which foreground reduction technique was used .",
    "these results are confirmed in the present paper .",
    "the new foreground reduction used in the 3year data enhances slightly the significance of our detection .",
    "moreover the multi - frequency analysis of the previous section shows an even flatter frequency dependence of _ the spot_.    as already discussed in previous sections the noise does not affect significantly our wavelet analysis .",
    "in fact the coadded 3year results are very similar to those obtained with the 1year data of the new data release .",
    "no significant cold spot is observed based on the analysis of the three difference maps ( year 1 - year 2 , year 2 - year 3 , and year 1 - year 3 ) . moreover figure  [ fig : t_freq ] shows that even the particularly @xmath54 contaminated w4 difference assembly shows almost the same result as all the other difference assemblies .",
    "in this paper we repeat the analyses that detected the non - gaussian cold spot called _ the spot _ at ( @xmath0 ) in wavelet space in the 1year of wmap data , using the recently released 3year wmap data .",
    "the previous works v04 , c05 , cjt and c06 found _ the spot _ to deviate significantly from the gaussian behaviour . _",
    "the spot _ was detected using several estimators , namely kurtosis , area , @xmath30 and hc .",
    "this work confirms the detection applying all these estimators to the recently published 3year wmap data . at scale",
    "@xmath36 , the upper tail probabilities of all these estimators when applied to the 3 year wmap data are smaller than the corresponding ones for the first year wmap data .",
    "this is mostly due to the improved foreground reduction of the data .",
    "we calculate the probability of finding such a deviation from gaussianity considering only skewness and kurtosis since these were initially used by v04 following a blind approach . therefore excluding followup tests which could be considered as _ a posteriori _ analyses we obtain a @xmath31-value of @xmath2",
    ". moreover , _ the spot _ appears to be almost frequency independent .",
    "this result reinforces the previous foreground analyses performed by c06 .",
    "it is very unlikely that foregrounds are responsible for the non - gaussian behaviour of _ the spot_. comparing the wmap single year sky maps , we conclude that the noise has a very low contribution to our wavelet analysis as already claimed in v04 , c05 .",
    "future works will be aimed at finding the origin of _ the spot_. as discussed in the introduction several possibilities have been considered , based on rees - sciama effects ( rees & sciama 1968 , martnez  gonzlez & sanz 1990 , martnez  gonzlez et al .",
    "1990 ) and inhomogenous or anisotropic universes .",
    "we are presently working on studying another : topological defects ( turok & spergel 1990 , durrer et al .",
    "1999 ) as textures could produce cold spots .",
    "new and more detailed analyses are required in order to answer that question .",
