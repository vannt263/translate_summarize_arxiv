    "we consider the de - convolution problem in the case of signals where the convolution kernel is space invariant . in that case",
    "the observed signal @xmath0 , @xmath1 is expressible as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the true signal .",
    "the approximation of the integral operator via an elementary rectangle formula over an equispaced grid with @xmath4 nodes leads to a linear system with @xmath4 equations .",
    "when imposing proper boundary conditions , the related undetermined linear system becomes square and invertible and fast filter algorithms of tikhonov type can be employed . when talking of fast algorithms , given @xmath4 the size of the related matrices , we mean an algorithm involving a constant number ( independent of @xmath4 ) of fast trigonometric transforms ( fourier , sine , cosine , hartley transforms ) so that the overall cost is given by @xmath5 arithmetic operations .",
    "for instance , when dealing with periodic boundary conditions , we obtain circulant matrices which are diagonalizable by using the celebrated fast fourier transform ( fft ) . unfortunately such boundary conditions are not always satisfactory from the viewpoint of the reconstruction quality . in fact , if the original signal is not periodic the presence of ringing effects given by the periodic boundary conditions spoils the precision of the reconstruction .",
    "more accurate models are described by the reflective @xcite and antireflective @xcite boundary conditions , where the continuity of the signal and of its derivative are imposed , respectively .",
    "however the fast algorithms are applicable in this context only when symmetric point spread functions ( psfs ) are taken into consideration .",
    "the psf represents the blur of a single pixel in the original signal .",
    "therefore , since it is reasonable to expect that the global light intensity is preserved , the psf is nothing else that a global mask having nonnegative entries and total sum equal to @xmath6 ( conservation law ) .",
    "often in several application such a psf is symmetric and consequently the symbol associated to its mask is an even function .",
    "usually the antireflective boundary conditions lead to better reconstructions since linear signals are reconstructed exactly , while the periodic boundary conditions approximate badly a linear function by a discontinuous one and the reflective ones by a piece - wise linear function : in both the latter case gibbs phenomena ( called ringing effects ) are observed which are especially pronounced for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the evidence of such fact is observed in several papers in the literature , e.g. @xcite .    such good behavior of the antireflective boundary conditions comes directly from their definition @xcite , since the continuity of the first derivative of the signal was automatically imposed . from an algebraic viewpoint ,",
    "the latter property can be derived from the spectral decomposition of the coefficient matrix in the associated linear system .",
    "indeed , when considering a symmetric psf and antireflective boundary conditions , the linear system is represented by a matrix whose eigenvalues equal to @xmath6 ( the normalization condition of the psf coming from the conservation law ) are associated to an eigenvector basis spanning all linear functions sampled over a uniform grid with @xmath4 nodes , see @xcite . in @xcite , such a remark has been the starting point for defining and analyzing the antireflective transform and for designing fast algorithms for the spectral filtering of blurred and noisy signals .",
    "this algebraic interpretation is useful because it can be used for proposing generalizations that preserve the possibility of defining fast algorithms , while increasing the expected reconstruction quality especially when smooth or piece - wise smooth signals are considered .    in this paper ,",
    "starting from the previous algebraic interpretation , we define higher order boundary conditions .",
    "this can be obtained by algebraically imposing that the spanning of quadratic or cubic polynomials over a proper uniform gridding are eigenvectors related to the normalized eigenvalue @xmath6 .",
    "our proposal improves the antireflective model when the true signal is regular enough close to the boundary .",
    "moreover , an important property of the proposed approach is that it allows to define fast algorithms also in the case of nonsymmetric psfs ( such as the blurring caused by motion ) .",
    "we note that reflective and antireflective boundary conditions can resort to fast transforms only in the case of symmetric boundary conditions , while in the case of nonsymmetric psf we have fast transforms only for periodic boundary conditions which usually provide poor restorations for nonperiodic signals .    in general ,",
    "if some information on the low frequencies of the signal to be reconstructed are available , it is sufficient to impose such sampled components as eigenvectors of the blurring operator related to the eigenvalue @xmath6 ( we recall that the global spectrum will have @xmath6 as spectral radius ) . in such a way these component",
    "will be maintained exactly by the filtering algorithms since they cut only the spectral components related to small eigenvalues ( somehow close to zero ) which are presumed to be essentially associated to the noise . in reality",
    ", the noise by its random nature of its entries will be decomposable essentially in high frequencies while the true signal is supposed to be approximated in the complementary subspace of low frequencies .",
    "therefore , when applying filtering algorithms , if the blurring operator has non - negligible eigenvalues associated only to low frequencies ( for instance low degree polynomials ) , then the reconstruction of the signal will be reasonably good while the noise will be efficiently reduced .    given this general context , the present note is aimed to define spectral decomposition of the blurring matrix such that the related transform given by the eigenvectors is fast , the conditioning of the transform is moderate ( for such an issue in connection with the antireflective transform see @xcite ) , and the low frequencies are associated only to non - negligible eigenvalues .    the organization of the paper is as follows . section [ sec : bcs ] we introduce the deblurring problem investigating the spectral decomposition of the coefficient matrix for the different kinds of boundary conditions . in section [ sec : hord ] we define higher order boundary conditions starting from the spectral decomposition of the antireflective matrix .",

    "however , they could be useful also for more sophisticated regularization methods like total variation for instance .",
    "the analysis of the tikhonov regularization in section [ sec : tik ] is useful also for the antireflective boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , it was not previously considered in the literature the case of @xmath197 and the choice of the regularization parameter @xmath145 using the gcv .",
    "since the proposed transforms are not orthogonal , they were applied in connection with the reblurring approach , but the theoretical analysis of the regularizing properties of such approach exists only in the case of antireflective boundary conditions and symmetric kernel ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a more detailed analysis , especially in the multidimensional case with a nonsymmetric kernel , should be considered in the future .",
