    "systematic surveys of the local universe ( @xmath4 ) can provide some of the most important constraints on dark matter , particularly through the measurement of the clustering of galaxies and clusters of galaxies on large scales .",
    "most existing galaxy and cluster catalogues are based on photographic plates @xcite , and there is growing concern that such surveys might suffer from severe surface - brightness selection effects , so that they are missing a substantial fraction of the galaxy population .",
    "in addition , the limited volume of existing redshift surveys means that even low - order clustering statistics , such as the galaxy two - point correlation function , can not reliably be measured on scales beyond @xmath5 , an order of magnitude below the scale on which cobe has measured fluctuations in the microwave background radiation .",
    "a collaboration has therefore been formed with the aim of constructing a definitive map of the local universe , incorporating digital ccd imaging over a large area in several passbands and redshifts for around one million galaxies . in order to complete such an ambitious project over a reasonable timescale",
    ", it was decided to build a _ dedicated _ 2.5-metre telescope equipped with a large ccd array imaging camera and multi - fibre spectrographs .",
    "the collaboration comprises around 100 astronomers and engineers from university of chicago , fermilab , princeton university , institute for advanced study , johns hopkins university , us naval observatory , university of washington and the jpg  a group of astronomers in japan .",
    "the total cost of the survey is around $ 30 million , and funding sources include the alfred p. sloan foundation , the national science foundation and the participating institutions .",
    "the survey site is apache point observatory , new mexico , at 2800 metres elevation .",
    "while better sites probably exist in chile and atop mauna kea , for a survey with such state - of - the - art instrumentation and significant on - site manpower requirements ( eg . fibre plugging and changing spectroscopic plates ) , it was decided to use a site within mainland usa and with good communications and existing infrastructure .",
    "the survey hardware comprises the main 2.5-metre telescope , equipped with ccd imaging camera and multi - fibre spectrographs , a 0.6-metre monitor telescope and a @xmath6 all - sky camera . on the best nights ( new moon , photometric , sub - arcsecond seeing )",
    "the 2.5-metre telescope will operate in imaging mode , drift scanning the sky at sidereal rate , and obtaining nearly simultaneously images in the five survey bands @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the system response curves through the five filters are shown in figure  [ fig : filters ] . on sub - optimal nights , which will comprise the bulk of observing time , the imaging camera will be replaced with a spectroscopic fibre plug - plate . it is planned that imaging data will be reduced and calibrated , spectroscopic targets selected , and plates drilled within the one - month lunar cycle , so that we will be obtaining spectra of objects that were imaged the previous month .",
    "we will spend most of the time observing within a contiguous @xmath0 steradian area in the north galactic cap ( ngc ) .",
    "for those times when the ngc is unavailable , about one third of the time , we will repeatedly observe three southern stripes , nominally centred at ra @xmath12 , and with central declinations of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the nominal location of survey scans is shown in figure  [ fig : stripes ] .    in the remainder of this section",
    "i discuss the various components of the survey in more detail",
    ".    * 2.5-metre telescope . *",
    "the main 2.5-metre telescope is of modified richey - chretien design with a @xmath16 field of view , and is optimised for both a wide - area imaging survey and a multi - fibre spectroscopic survey of galaxies to @xmath17 .",
    "one of the most unusual aspects of the telescope is it s enclosure . rather than sitting inside a dome ,",
    "as is the case with conventional optical telescopes , the enclosure is a rectangular frame structure mounted on wheels , which is rolled away from the telescope in order to take observations . by completely removing the enclosure from the telescope , we can avoid the substantial degradation to image quality due to dome seeing .",
    "the telescope is situated on a pier overlooking a steep dropoff so that the prevailing wind will flow smoothly over the telescope in a laminar flow , which will also help to ensure good image quality .",
    "a wind baffle closely surrounds the telescope , and is independently mounted and driven .",
    "this baffle serves to protect the telscope from stray light as well as from wind buffeting .",
    "* imaging camera . * in order to image a large area of sky in a short time , we are building an imaging camera ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imcam ] ) that contains @xmath18 ccds , arranged in six columns .",
    "each column occupies its own dewar and contains one chip in each of the five filters .",
    "pixel size is @xmath19 .",
    "the camera operates in drift - scan mode : a star or galaxy image drifts down the column through the five filters , spending about 55 seconds in each .",
    "this mode of observing has two significant advantages over conventional tracking mode .",
    "1 ) it makes extremely efficient use of observing time , since there is no overhead between exposures : on a good night we can open the shutter , drift - scan for eight hours and then close the shutter .",
    "2 ) since each image traverses a whole column of pixels on each ccd , flat - fielding becomes a one - dimensional problem , and so can be done to lower surface - brightness limits than with tracking mode images .",
    "this , along with the high quantum efficiency of modern ccds , will enable us to detect galaxies of much lower surface brightness than can wide - field photographic surveys .",
    "there is a gap between each column of ccds , but this gap is slightly smaller than the width of the light - sensitive area of the ccds , and so having observed six narrow strips of sky one night , we can observe an interleaving set of strips a later night , and thus build up a large contiguous area of sky .",
    "the northern survey comprises 45 pairs of interleaving great circle scans , and so imaging observations for the north will require the equivalent of 90 full photometric nights .",
    "the camera also includes 24 smaller ccds arranged above and below the photometric columns .",
    "these extra ccds , equipped with neutral density filters , are used for astrometric calibration , as most astrometric standards will saturate on the photometric ccds .",
    "thus the photometric data can be tied to the fundamental astrometric reference frames defined by bright stars .",
    "* spectrographs . * the 2.5-metre telescope will also be equipped with a pair of fibre - fed , dual - beam spectrographs , each with two cameras , two gratings and two @xmath20 ccd detectors .",
    "the blue channel will cover the wavelength range 39006100   and the red channel 59009100   and both will have a spectral resolving power @xmath21 .",
    "the fibres are @xmath22 in diameter and the two spectrographs each hold 320 fibres . rather than employing robotic fibre positioners to place the fibres in the focal plane",
    ", we will instead drill aluminium plates for each spectroscopic field and plug the fibres by hand .",
    "we plan on spectroscopic exposure times of 45 minutes and allow 15 minutes overhead per fibre plate . on a clear winter s night",
    "we can thus obtain 8 plates @xmath23 640 fibres @xmath24 spectra . in order to allow such rapid turnaround time between exposures we plan to purchase 8 sets of fibre harnesses ,",
    "so that each plate can be plugged with fibres during the day .",
    "it will not be necessary to plug each fibre in any particular hole , as a fibre mapping system has been built which will automatically map fibre number onto position in the focal plane after the plate has been plugged .",
    "this should considerably ease the job of the fibre pluggers , and we expect that it will take well under one hour to plug each plate .    * monitor telescope . * in order to check that observing conditions are photometric , and to tie imaging observations to a set of primary photometric standards , we are also employing a monitor telescope .",
    "while the 2.5-metre telescope is drift - scanning the sky , the 0.6-metre monitor telescope , situated close by , will interleave observations of standard stars with calibration patches in the area of sky being scanned .",
    "operation of this telescope will be completely automated , and each hour will observe three calibration patches plus standard stars in all five colours .    * @xmath6 all - sky camera . * as an additional check on observing conditions , a @xmath6 infrared camera will survey the entire sky every 10 minutes or so .",
    "light cirrus , which is very hard to see on a dark night , is bright at @xmath6 , and so this camera will provide rapid warning of increasing cloud cover , thus enabling us to switch to spectroscopic observing rather than taking non - photometric imaging data .",
    "= 0.6    * data - reduction pipelines . * the last , but by no means least , component of the survey is a suite of automated data - reduction pipelines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dataflow ] ) , which will read dlt tapes mailed to fermilab from the mountain and yield reduced and calibrated data with the minimum of human intervention .",
    "such software is very necessary when one considers that the imaging camera will produce data at the rate of around 31 gbytes per hour ! a `` production system '' has been specced and purchased that can keep up with such a data rate ( bearing in mind that imaging will take place only under the best conditions , on average around two full nights per month ) , and consists of two digital alphaserver 8200 5/300s , each with 1 gbyte of memory .",
    "pipelines exist to reduce each source of data from the mountain ( photometric frames and `` postage stamps '' , astrometric frames , monitor telescope frames and 2-d spectra ) as well as to perform tasks such as spectroscopic target selection and `` adaptive tiling '' to work out the optimal placing of spectroscopic field centres to maximize the number of spectra obtained .",
    "the pipelines are integrated into a purpose - written environment known as shiva ( survey human interface and visualization environment , also the hindu god of destruction ) and the reduced data will be written into an object - oriented database .",
    "the raw imaging data in five colours for the @xmath0 steradians of the northern sky will occupy about 14 tbytes , but it is expected that very few projects will need to access the raw data , which will probably be stored only on magnetic tape . since most of the sky is blank to @xmath1 , all detected images can be stored , using suitable compression , in around 200 gbytes , and it is expected that these `` atlas images '' can be kept on spinning disc .",
    "the photometric reduction pipeline will meaure a set of parameters for each image , and it is estimated that the parameter lists for all objects will occupy @xmath25 gbyte . the parameter lists for the spectroscopic sample will proabbly fit into 12 gb , and the spectra themselves will occupy @xmath26 gb .",
    "work is progressing well on an astronomer - friendly interface to the database , which will answer such queries as `` return all galaxies with @xmath27 and within 30 arcminutes of this quasar '' , etc .",
    "the spectroscopic sample is divided into several classes . in a survey of this magnitude , it is important that the selection criteria for each class remain fixed throughout the duration of the survey .",
    "therefore , we will spend a considerable time ( maybe one year ) , obtaining test data with the survey instruments and refining the spectroscopic selection criteria in light of our test data .",
    "then , once the survey proper has commenced , these criteria will be `` frozen in '' for the duration of the survey .",
    "the numbers discussed below are therefore only preliminary , and we expect them to change slightly during the test year",
    ".    the * main galaxy sample * will consist of @xmath28 galaxies selected by petrosian magnitude in the @xmath9 band , @xmath29 .",
    "simulations have shown that the petrosian magnitude , which is based on an aperture defined by the ratio of light within an annulus to total light inside that radius , provides probably the least biased and most stable estimate of total magnitude .",
    "there will also be a surface - brightness limit , so that we do not waste fibres on galaxies of too low surface brightness to give a reasonable spectrum .",
    "this galaxy sample will have a median redshift @xmath30 .",
    "we plan to observe an additional @xmath31 * luminous red galaxies * to @xmath32 .",
    "given photometry in the five survey bands , redshifts can be estimated for the reddest galaxies to @xmath33 or better @xcite , and so one can also predict their luminosity quite accurately . selecting luminous red galaxies , many of which will be cd galaxies in cluster cores , provides a valuable supplement to the main galaxy sample since 1 ) they will have distinctive spectral features , allowing a redshift to be measured up to 1.5 mag fainter than the main sample , and 2 ) they will form an approximately volume - limited sample with a median redshift @xmath34",
    ". they will thus provide an extremely powerful sample for studying clustering on the largest scales and the evolution of galaxies .",
    "* quasar * candidates will be selected by making cuts in multi - colour space and from the first radio catalogue @xcite , with the aim of observing @xmath31 quasars .",
    "this sample will be orders of magnitude larger than any existing quasar catalogues , and will be invaluable for quasar luminosity function , evolution and clustering studies as well as providing sources for followup absorption - line observations .",
    "in addition to the above three classes of spectroscopic sources , which are designed to provide _ statistically complete _ samples , we will also obtain spectra for many thousands of * stars * and for various * serendipitous * objects . the latter class will include objects of unusual colour or morphology which do not fit into the earlier classes , plus unusual objects found by other surveys and in other wavebands .",
    "in this section i discuss the status ( as of april 1996 ) of the various systems within the survey .",
    "the * monitor telescope * has been operational now for several months , and is routinely operated remotely from chicago .",
    "it is equipped with a set of sdss filters , and is being used to observe candidate primary photometric standard stars , as well as known quasars to see where they lie in the sdss colour system @xcite .",
    "the * 2.5-metre telescope * structure was installed on the mountaintop in october 1995 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tel ] ) .",
    "work is currently underway on the control systems for the telescope .",
    "telescope * optics * are all due to be ready by june 1996 .",
    "these include the primary and secondary mirrors and various corrector elements .",
    "we posess all of the ccds for the * imaging camera * , which is under construction at princeton .",
    "delivery to the mountain is expected by september 1996 .",
    "construction of the * spectrographs * is well underway , with the optics installed for one of the spectrograph cameras .",
    "each of the data reduction - pipelines is now basically working , with ongoing work on minor bug - fixes , speed - ups and integration of the entire data processing system .",
    "the photometric reduction pipeline is being tested using both simulated data and with data taken using the fermilab drift scan camera on the arc 3.5-metre telescope at the same site .",
    "similar tests are being carried out on the spectroscopic reduction pipeline , and our ability to efficiently place fibres on a clustered distribution of galaxies is being tested using the apm galaxy catalogue @xcite .",
    "the currently - projected survey schedule is as follows :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the intent of this project is to make the survey data available to the astronomical community in a timely fashion .",
    "we currently plan to distribute the data from the first two years of the survey no later than two years after it is taken , and the full survey no later than two years after it is finished .",
    "the first partial release may or may not be in its final form , depending on our ability to calibrate it fully at the time of the release .",
    "the same remarks apply to the release of the full data set , but we expect the calibration effort to be finished before that release .",
    "since one of the topics of this meeting is dark matter , i will highlight two of the areas in which the sdss will provide valuable data for constraining dark matter .",
    "the huge volume of the sdss redshift survey will enable estimates of the galaxy power spectrum to @xmath35 scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : p_k ] shows the power spectrum @xmath36 we would expect to measure from a volume - limited ( to @xmath37 ) sample of galaxies from the sdss northern redshift survey , assuming gaussian fluctuations and a @xmath38 cdm model .",
    "the error bars include cosmic variance and shot noise , but not systematic errors , due , for example , to galactic obscuration .",
    "provided such errors can be corrected for , ( and star colours in the sloan survey will provide our best _ a posteriori _ estimate of galactic obscuration ) , then the figure shows that we can easily distinguish between @xmath39 and @xmath38 models , just using the northern main galaxy sample . adding the southern stripe data , and the luminous red galaxy sample , will further decrease measurement errors on the largest scales , and so we also expect to be able to easily distinguish between low - density cdm and mdm models , and models with differing indices @xmath40 for the shape of the primordial fluctuation spectrum .      by measuring the distortions introduced by streaming motions into redshift - space measures of galaxy clustering",
    ", one can constrain the parameter @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the cosmological density paramter and @xmath43 is the bias factor relating fluctuations in galaxy number density to fluctuations in the underlying mass distribution . while existing redshift surveys , eg . iras",
    "@xcite and stromlo - apm @xcite , are hinting that @xmath44 ( ie . that galaxies are significantly biased tracers of mass or that @xmath45 ) , their volumes are too small to measure galaxy clustering in the fully linear regime reliably enough to measure @xmath46 to much better than 50% or so . with the sdss redshift survey",
    ", we expect to be able to constrain @xmath46 to 10% or better .",
    "there are several ways we might hope to determine the galaxy bias factor @xmath43 . by measuring galaxy clustering on @xmath35 scales as shown in figure  [ fig : p_k ]",
    ", we can compare with the cobe microwave background fluctuations directly , and so constrain large - scale galaxy bias in a model - independent way .",
    "analysis of higher - order clustering statistics @xcite , and of non - linear dynamical effects @xcite will also set constraints on galaxy bias .",
    "knowing @xmath46 and @xmath43 .",
    "we will be in a good position to reliably measure the cosmological density parameter @xmath42 independent of models for the shape of the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "it is probably no exaggeration to claim that the sloan digital sky survey will revolutionize the field of large scale structure .",
    "certainly we can expect to rule out large numbers of presently viable cosmological models , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : p_k ] .",
    "as well as measuring redshifts for a carefully controlled sample of @xmath2 galaxies and @xmath3 quasars , the survey will also provide high quality imaging data for about 100 times as many extragalactic objects , from which one can obtain colour and morphological information .",
    "in addition to measuring the basic cosmological parameters @xmath42 and @xmath47 discussed in the preceding section , the sdss will also allow us to measure the properties of galaxies as a function of their colour , morphology and environment , providing valuable clues to the process of galaxy formation .",
    "finally , i can not resist the temptation to give a visual impression of what we might expect to see with the sdss redshift survey .",
    "figure  [ fig : slice ] shows the distribution of 62,295 galaxies in a @xmath48 slice from a simulation carried out by changbom park , assuming a low - density cdm model .",
    "this slice represents just _ one sixteenth _ of the million galaxy redshifts we will be measuring with the sloan survey .",
    "i leave it to the readers imagination to dream up all the projects they would love to carry out given such a data - set .",
    "the work described here has been carried out by many people throughout the sdss collaboration , and i thank all my colleagues warmly .",
    "i am particularly grateful to chris stoughton and michael vogeley for providing figures  [ fig : stripes ] and figure  [ fig : p_k ] respectively , and to philippe canal for translating the abstract into french .",
