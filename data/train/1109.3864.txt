    "<S> this shows the potential benefit of using the @xmath4p@xmath6 as quantum spin memory @xcite .    the observed @xmath4p@xmath5 coherence time is shorter than the one measured in bulk natural silicon @xcite , suggesting that in our sample additional decoherence of the @xmath4p@xmath5 is caused by the presence of the nearby interface , e.g. , via the hyperfine interaction by the coupling of the donor electron to fluctuating charges in the oxide . in the case of the @xmath4p@xmath6 , </S>",

    "<S> calculations show that spectral diffusion due to dipolar coupling of the @xmath4p@xmath6 to @xmath57si nuclear spins results in a stretched exponential echo decay with a coherence time of @xmath4530  ms and an exponent of @xmath451.4 @xcite , in good agreement with our experimental results . </S>",

    "<S> the inset shows the @xmath4p@xmath6 echo fitted by two back - to - back exponential decays ( line ) . ]    in summary , we have used pulsed illumination in combination with coherent spin manipulation to selectively depopulate the @xmath4p donors depending on their nuclear spin state . in the field of </S>",

    "<S> based on the selective depopulation technique , we have achieved spectroscopy of ionized - donor nuclear spins and investigated their coherence time by means of edendor . </S>",
    "<S> since the linewidth of the nuclear spin transition can be greatly reduced by ionizing the donor , this technique allows for a more precise spectroscopy of the nuclear spin , e.g. by studying the influence of local strains @xcite or electric fields on the @xmath4p@xmath6 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this method can be applied to other donors in silicon with @xmath58 , e.g.  @xmath59bi , where the investigation of the nuclear quadrupole splitting as a function of strain is an appealing challenge  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this makes the presented selective depopulation scheme particularly useful for studying defects in semiconductor nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> the longer coherence time of the @xmath4p@xmath6 compared to the @xmath4p@xmath5 renders the ionized donor an attractive candidate for a quantum spin memory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to realize such a quantum memory , the nuclear spin coherence must not be destroyed by the process of depopulating and repopulating the donor . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ionization and deionization should take place deterministically , which could be realized , e.g. , by electric gates @xcite or optical excitation @xcite , rather than by the statistical recombination process employed here . </S>",
