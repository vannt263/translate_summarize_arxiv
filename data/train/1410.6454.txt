    "there are relatively few techniques available for studying smoothing theory on open @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "it was shown by quinn in @xcite that every open @xmath1-manifold admits at least one smooth structure . while there are many examples that actually admit uncountably many diffeomorphism classes of smooth structures , it is still unknown if this can be expected in general . in particular , it is still conceivable that some open @xmath1-manifold is uniquely smoothable up to diffeomorphism .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend existing technology for understanding exotic open @xmath1-manifolds by exploring the relationship between exotic @xmath0 s and stein surfaces .",
    "we construct an uncountable family of exotic @xmath0 s with previously unknown properties , and we exploit these to gain a new level of control over existing invariants of exotic smoothings on open @xmath1-manifolds .    historically , methods for finding infinite families of exotic open @xmath1-manifolds relied heavily on information about the behavior of smoothings on @xmath0 . in @xcite , gompf defined the first infinite collection of exotic @xmath0 s , smooth @xmath1-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "uncountably many exotic @xmath0 s were later produced by taubes in @xcite by extending donaldson theory and then applying the results in conjunction with freedman s breakthroughs from @xcite .",
    "this was the first @xmath1-manifold to exhibit such uncountable behavior .",
    "related families of smooth structures were subsequently defined on more general open @xmath1-manifolds by fixing some standard smooth structure and then attaching infinitely many different @xmath0 s using an operation introduced by gompf in @xcite called _ end - summing_. under sufficiently nice conditions , this resulted in infinitely many diffeomorphism classes ( sometimes countable and sometimes uncountable ) on the same underlying @xmath1-manifold .",
    "for example , see the work of biaca and etnyre in @xcite , taylor s generalization in @xcite , results from gompf in @xcite , and additional generalizations by ding in @xcite , fang in @xcite , and gompf and stipsicz in section 9.3 of @xcite .",
    "the hypotheses required for this procedure to succeed depended greatly on what was known about the @xmath0 s being attached . in most cases ,",
    "the resulting diffeomorphism types were distinguishable either by the _ taylor invariant _ from @xcite",
    "( taking values in @xmath2 ) or a generalization of _ compact equivalence classes _ from @xcite , which are two invariants that measure the complexity of embedded exotic @xmath0 s in a given smooth @xmath1-manifold .",
    "however , little information beyond these invariants was known about the exotic open @xmath1-manifolds that were produced",
    ". additionally , it seems likely that the methods for detecting exoticness were too coarse . at this stage , however , it was not clear what additional structure could be expected from exotic @xmath0 s that would be helpful for obtaining a better understanding of this construction .",
    "more recently , gompf exploited the rich structure associated to _ stein surfaces _ to study open @xmath1-manifolds in @xcite .",
    "a stein surface is an open , complex @xmath1-manfiold that admits a proper , biholomorphic embedding into some ambient @xmath3 .",
    "these have associated _ adjunction inequalities _ that place restrictions on an invariant called the _ genus - rank function_. this invariant was introduced in @xcite , measuring the genera of smoothly embedded , homologically essential surfaces in a given smooth @xmath1-manifold . in @xcite ,",
    "exotic smooth structures on many handlebody interiors were defined by replacing standard @xmath4-handles with _",
    "casson handles_. after embedding into stein surfaces and applying the associated adjunction inequalities , the resulting diffeomorphism types were distinguished by their genus - rank functions .",
    "despite the significant advancements in the study of exotic @xmath1-manifolds that have been facilitated by stein surfaces , these techniques had not previously been considered in the case of open @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "the developments from @xcite demonstrated the importance of stein surfaces to our current setting .",
    "this paper constructs exotic @xmath0 s while maintaining control over their relationship with stein surfaces .",
    "our primary interest will be in _ large _",
    "@xmath0 s , i.e. those that contain smooth , compact , codimension-@xmath5 submanifolds that do not embed in the standard @xmath0 . for context",
    ", we note that both the taylor invariant and compact equivalence class measure the size of @xmath0 s .",
    "in particular , all @xmath0 s with either non - zero taylor invariant or a different compact equivalence class than the standard @xmath0 are large .",
    "there are various constructions of large @xmath0 s appearing in the literature .",
    "for example , gompf defines infinitely many large @xmath0 s in @xcite using topologically slice links and later constructs doubly - indexed uncountable families of large @xmath0 s in both @xcite and @xcite by analyzing compact equivalence classes , biaca and etnyre in @xcite and taylor in @xcite find @xmath0 s with arbitrarily large values of the taylor invariant and sometimes uncountably many compact equivalence classes , and freedman and taylor produce a _",
    "universal @xmath0 _ in @xcite containing all other @xmath0 s as end - summands",
    ". however , the connection between large @xmath0 s and stein surface has never before been investigated . there",
    "do exist exotic @xmath0 s that are contained in stein surface , but all previously known examples are necessarily small .",
    "( most small @xmath0 s actually embed in @xmath6 , and gompf produces small @xmath0 s that admit stein structures in both @xcite and @xcite . )    we define the first collection of large @xmath0 s that each come equipped with an embedding into a stein surface , chosen so that they still carry the information necessary for manipulating both the taylor invariant and compact equivalence classes .",
    "there exist uncountably many large @xmath0 s that each admit a smooth embedding into a stein surface .",
    "furthermore , these realize arbitrarily large ( finite ) values of the taylor invariant by uncountably many compact equivalence classes .",
    "it turns out that the diffeomorphism type of each stein surface only depends on the taylor invariant of the corresponding @xmath0 .",
    "so we ve produced an uncountable family of large @xmath0 s inside a countable family of stein surfaces .",
    "it follows from remark 4.5 of @xcite that these @xmath0 s fail to admit a handle decomposition without infinitely many @xmath7-handles , while stein surfaces always admit a handle decomposition with no @xmath7- or @xmath1-handles . in particular , these @xmath0 s do not admit stein structures themselves .",
    "this theorem is an immediate consequence of theorem [ instein ] and corollary [ notstein ] , which provide much more detail about the structure of these @xmath0 s .",
    "corollary [ notu ] obtains a similar result in the case of infinite taylor invariant .",
    "these properties should not be expected generically from large @xmath0 s . to emphasize this",
    ", we produce another family that behaves similarly on the level of the taylor invariant but has a very different relationship with stein surfaces .    there",
    "exist exotic @xmath0 s that realize arbitrarily large ( finite ) values of the taylor invariant and each contain a smooth , compact , codimension-@xmath5 submanifold that does not smoothly embed into any stein surface .    as we ve stated it ,",
    "this theorem is a slightly weakened version of theorem [ notinstein ] .",
    "its proof relies on lemma [ smalllemma ] , which provides an explicit description of compact handlebodies that fail to embed into any stein surface ( even when we allow the embedding to be trivial on the level of second homology ) .",
    "we begin illustrating the usefulness of these new @xmath0 s by analyzing the behavior of the genus - rank function under the end - sum operation .",
    "we observe that the adjunction inequality associated to stein surfaces can be preserved while end - summing with certain large @xmath0 s , even though they do not admit stein structures themselves .",
    "if a smooth @xmath1-manifold is obtained by end - summing some stein surface with an @xmath0 defined by theorem 1.1 , then it still satisfies the adjunction inequality associated to this stein surface .",
    "much stronger versions of this theorem can be found in lemma [ almoststein ] and corollary [ stein ] .",
    "conversely , end - summing with the large @xmath0 s produced by theorem 1.2 can significantly influence the genus - rank function .",
    "as seen in example [ endsummingex ] , this operation easily modifies stein surfaces so that they no longer satisfy the adjunction inequality .",
    "armed with this result , we systematically study the way end - summing with large @xmath0 s effects the taylor invariant , compact equivalence classes , and the genus - rank function . in the best case ,",
    "we find that all three invariants can be controlled independently . to start ,",
    "we restrict our attention to two invariants :    suppose that @xmath8 is a open topological @xmath1-manifold that is the interior of an oriented , spin handlebody with all indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "then there are smooth structures on @xmath8 that realize infinitely many values of taylor invariant but all produce the same genus - rank function , and infinitely many genus - rank functions occur in this way .",
    "similarly , there are smooth structures on @xmath8 that produce infinitely many genus - rank functions but all realize the same arbitrarily large ( finite ) value of the taylor invariant .    after adding a technical requirement , we establish control over the missing invariant :    if the standard smooth structure that @xmath8 inherits as a handlebody interior is compactly positive definite , then each pair of taylor invariant and genus - rank function from this theorem is realized by smooth structures on @xmath8 representing uncountably many compact equivalence classes .",
    "we also provide similar theorems for each pair of invariants under various relaxed hypotheses .",
    "additionally , we can sometimes apply other nice properties of these @xmath0 s to produce uncountable families realizing each triple that occurs in these results .",
    "precise statements of these different cases and many examples can be found in the second half of section 3 .",
    "the two contrasting families of @xmath0 s produced in this paper rely on very different constructions .",
    "the definition of the first family requires a careful study of casson handles , which is used to sharpen a standard cut - and - paste argument for constructing large @xmath0 s .",
    "more specifically , we introduce a procedure for locating casson handles in closed @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "while such a procedure already existed in various forms ( e.g. see casson s embedding theorem in @xcite , quinn s handle straightening theorem in @xcite , and gompf s exposition in section 5 of @xcite ) , our method is the first to provide control over the topology of the casson handles that are produced . after fixing our initial setup",
    ", we give a complete characterization of when a single casson handle can be found without losing this extra control .",
    "we also investigate when multiple casson handles can be located simultaneously .",
    "our answer turns out to be a substantial extension of previous results .",
    "it is obtained by modifying casson s original embedding theorem from @xcite using the arf invariant associated to characteristic surfaces , which is defined by freedman and kirby in @xcite .",
    "this can all be found in section 2 .",
    "the second family is constructed by exhausting the universal @xmath0 defined in @xcite by smaller @xmath0 s . after finding compact handlebodies that do not embed into any stein surface",
    ", the existence of the necessary compact submanifolds follows from a technique in @xcite for embedding compact handlebodies into @xmath0 s .",
    "* organization : * section 2 provides a careful introduction to casson handles , describes the procedure for locating casson handles in closed @xmath1-manifolds , and investigates various applications of this procedure . in section 3 , we define the two families of @xmath0 s described above and study the implications of their different relationships to stein surfaces .",
    "finally , section 4 analyzes the effect of end - summing with these two families .",
    "* conventions : * all handlebodies are assumed to be _ self - indexing _ and locally finite , which means they can be constructed in a locally finite way by simultaneously attaching all handles of a given index to the collection of handles that have strictly smaller index . every open @xmath1-manifold is the interior of a handlebody meeting this description , and it follows from the appendix of @xcite that these requirements do not increase the highest index handle required to describe a given open @xmath1-manifold as a handlebody interior .",
    "this paper will refer to @xmath1-dimensional stein domains , the compact analogue to open stein surfaces , as compact stein surfaces .",
    "we direct the reader to section 11 of @xcite for more information about stein surfaces , and also for the minimal amount of background pertaining to contact structures that is required for this paper . as a convention",
    ", we will not assume that embeddings are orientation - preserving unless explicitly stated .",
    "however , all immersion are assumed to be generic and all homotopies are assumed to be regular .",
    "the notation @xmath11 will be used to denote a smooth @xmath1-manifold that is obtained by equipping some topological @xmath1-manifold @xmath8 with a smooth structure @xmath12 .",
    "we will leave out the subscript when the smooth structure is clear from context , as is the case for most of section 2 and section 3 .    * acknowledgements :",

    "much of this work was completed while being supported by nsf grant dms-@xmath13 .",
    "the goal of this section is to introduce a procedure for constructing casson handles in closed @xmath1-manifolds , designed to provide some control over the topology of the casson handles that are produced .",
    "we begin with a discussion about kinky handles .",
    "recall that a _",
    "kinky handle _ is obtained by performing self - plumbings on the standard @xmath4-handle .",
    "suppose that @xmath14 is a kinky handle and @xmath15 is the immersed disk produced by the plumbing operation .",
    "the diffeomorphism type of @xmath14 is uniquely determined by the signs associated to the double points of @xmath15 . to attach @xmath14 to a framed circle , we first attach the standard @xmath4-handle to this circle using the framing that is obtained by adding @xmath16 signed twists to the given framing .",
    "then we perform the necessary self - plumbings , so that @xmath14 is now attaching to this circle in such a way that @xmath15 pushes off along the given framing to a disk whose algebraic intersection with @xmath15 vanishes .    it will be helpful to also have an alternate description of kinky handles .",
    "observe that @xmath17 is a regular neighborhood of the disk @xmath18 and also of its union with any collection of parallel disks @xmath19 for points",
    "after equipping each disk with an orientation , this union is bounded by the oriented link shown in the first diagram in figure 1 .",
    "attaching @xmath21-handles to @xmath22 as shown in the second diagram in figure 1 produces a @xmath1-manifold that is a regular neighborhood of a smoothly immersed disk @xmath15 , obtained by ambiently boundary summing @xmath18 with each of these parallel disks using the @xmath4-dimensional @xmath21-handles shown in red .",
    "the original choice of orientations defines an orientation on @xmath15 , so we can arrange for the signed double points of @xmath15 to realize any desired configuration by choosing the correct number of parallel disks and orienting them appropriately .",
    "observe that @xmath23 is the circle in @xmath24 shown in the final diagram in figure 1 .",
    "thus , every kinky handle is diffeomorphic to @xmath25 and its attaching region is a regular neighborhood of @xmath23 in @xmath24 , provided we arrange for @xmath15 to have the appropriate signed double points .",
    "the @xmath5-framing on @xmath23 from figure 1 will be called the @xmath5-framing on this attaching region . from this perspective , attaching a kinky handle to a framed knot is equivalent to attaching @xmath25 along this attaching region by identifying its @xmath5-framing with the framing given on this knot . using casson s terminology , we will say that the _ frontier _ of a kinky handle is the subset of its boundary obtained by removing its attaching region .",
    "this abstract description of kinky handles is useful when constructing casson handles . in particular",
    ", we can define a set of framed circles on the frontier of any kinky handle @xmath14 by first fixing an identification with the final diagram in figure 1 ( preserving attaching regions ) and then choosing a @xmath5-framed meridian of each dotted circle in this diagram .",
    "we say that any set of framed circles obtained in this way is a _ collapsing set _ for @xmath14 . attaching standard @xmath4-handles to @xmath14 along any collapsing set recovers the standard @xmath4-handle with its standard @xmath5-framing . to avoid special cases",
    ", we will treat the standard @xmath4-handle as a kinky handle with an empty collapsing set .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 98,229 )    we provide a brief description of casson handles , but encourage the reader to see section 2 of @xcite , section 2 of @xcite , or chapter 7 of @xcite for alternate descriptions and more detailed exposition . to construct a casson handle , we start with a _ 1-stage tower _ @xmath26 consisting of a single kinky handle and its attaching region .",
    "then we construct a _ 2-stage tower _ @xmath27 by attaching kinky handles to @xmath28 along a collapsing set for @xmath28 .",
    "next , we produce a @xmath7-stage tower @xmath29 by attaching kinky handles along collapsing sets for each kinky handle attached in the previous step . iterating",
    "this procedure defines an _ n - stage tower _",
    "@xmath30 for every @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we obtain a nested sequence @xmath32 .",
    "casson handle _",
    "@xmath33 is obtained by taking the infinite union @xmath34 of any nested towers that are constructed in this manner and then removing all boundary except the interior of @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to the immersed disk @xmath15 corresponding to @xmath28 as the _ first stage disk _ of @xmath33 .",
    "the remaining boundary of @xmath33 is the attaching region of @xmath33 and it comes equipped with a @xmath5-framing corresponding to the @xmath5-framing on @xmath35",
    ". we can attach @xmath33 to a framed circle by identifying this @xmath5-framing with the given framing on the circle .",
    "the fundamental result of freedman from @xcite states that every casson handle is homeomorphic to the standard open @xmath4-handle by a homeomorphism that preserves attaching regions .",
    "so attaching casson handles to a collection of @xmath5- and @xmath21-handles and then removing the remaining boundary produces a smooth , open @xmath1-manifold that is homeomorphic ( but possibly not diffeomorphic ) to the result of replacing each of these casson handles with the standard open @xmath4-handle .",
    "following @xcite , any smooth structure constructed in this way will be called a _",
    "casson smoothing_. if the resulting smooth @xmath1-manifold admits a stein structure , then it is also referred to as a _ stein - casson smoothing_. a very useful property of casson handles is that every casson handle embeds into the standard @xmath4-handle by a smooth , orientation - preserving embedding that preserves attaching regions .",
    "we turn our attention to locating casson handles in closed @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "we would like to realize some pre - assigned configuration of double points in the first stage disks of the casson handles we produce .",
    "we start with a smoothly immersed sphere @xmath36 in a closed @xmath1-manifold @xmath8 .",
    "observe that a regular neighborhood of @xmath36 in @xmath8 can be identified with a smoothly embedded copy of @xmath37 for some @xmath21-stage tower @xmath28 attaching to an @xmath38-framed unknot in @xmath39 , with the diffeomorphism type of @xmath28 uniquely determined by the signs associated to the double points of @xmath36 .",
    "if there are smoothly embedded , disjoint casson handles in @xmath8 that ambiently attach to @xmath37 along a collapsing set on the frontier of @xmath28 , then the interior of @xmath37 together with these new casson handles is the interior of a smoothly embedded copy of @xmath40 for some casson handle @xmath33 whose first stage is @xmath28 .",
    "we call the casson handles attaching to @xmath28 _ second stage casson handles _ because they are attaching to a @xmath21-stage tower .",
    "so @xmath33 is is obtained from @xmath28 by attaching these second stage casson handles and then removing all remaining boundary except the interior of the attaching region of @xmath28 .",
    "this construction ensures that @xmath36 is the union of the first stage disk of @xmath33 and a smoothly embedded , unknotted disk in @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the configuration of double points in @xmath36 dictates the double points in the first stage disk of the resulting casson handle @xmath33 .",
    "so we have reduced our task to determining conditions on smoothly immersed spheres that guarantee the existence of these second stage casson handles . once completed , locating a smoothly immersed sphere satisfying this criterion and realizing some desired configuration of double points is equivalent to locating a casson handle with that configuration of double points in its first stage disk .",
    "we will later consider this setup for multiple immersed spheres in order to construct multiple casson handles at once .",
    "under sufficiently nice conditions , the proof of casson s embedding theorem from @xcite provides a procedure for finding second stage casson handles .",
    "we state this theorem below using the terminology we have introduced .",
    "suppose that @xmath41 are smoothly immersed disks in a smooth , simply connected @xmath1-manifold @xmath42 , with @xmath43 disjointly embedded in @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 for each @xmath46 and there are homology classes @xmath47 such that each @xmath48 and each @xmath49 is even , then @xmath50 can be smoothly homotoped rel @xmath51 so that @xmath41 are the first stage disks of smoothly embedded , disjoint casson handles @xmath52 in @xmath42 .    our primary application will only consider a single immersed disk , obtained from an immersed sphere by removing the interior of a small @xmath22 neighborhood around one of its points .",
    "however , the homotopy of @xmath53 is not desirable because we lose control over the double points of each @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath41 are initially disjoint and @xmath55 is simply connected , then it follows from the proof of this theorem that the same result holds without needing to first perform a homotopy .",
    "when @xmath42 admits a spin structure , the proof also ensures that these additional hypotheses can actually replace the requirement that @xmath56 exist and we again obtain this result without needing to perform a homotopy . in either of these two cases ,",
    "the casson handles are constructed by the method described in the previous paragraph , i.e. by identifying a regular neighborhood of @xmath57 with disjoint @xmath21-stage towers and then locating disjoint second stage casson handles in @xmath42 that are ambiently attaching to this neighborhood along collapsing sets for each @xmath21-stage tower .",
    "a key step in the construction of these second stage casson handles is producing immersed disks in @xmath58 that are bounded by these collapsing sets and each push - off by the given framing to realize an even self - intersection number .",
    "once these disks have been located , the existence of the second stage casson handles only relies on the requirement that @xmath59 is simply connected .",
    "unfortunately , this proof fails to produce these disks outside of the two situations we have described . in particular , this step can not be completed when @xmath55 is spin but @xmath42 is not spin .",
    "this situation occurs , for example , if some @xmath54 is poincar dual to @xmath60 .    by using tools provided by freedman and kirby in @xcite to choose appropriate collapsing sets",
    ", we will sometimes be able to locate these disks used in the construction of second stage casson handles even when the conditions necessary for the proof of casson s embedding theorem are not satisfied .",
    "the results from @xcite associate a quadratic form @xmath61 to any smoothly embedded , orientable surface @xmath62 in a smooth , oriented , closed @xmath1-manifold @xmath8 , provided that @xmath62 represents the poincar dual to @xmath63 .",
    "this quadratic form has the property that if @xmath64 is a smoothly immersed surface in @xmath8 bounded by a circle @xmath65 with the interior of @xmath64 disjoint from @xmath62 , then @xmath66 equals the modulo @xmath4 self - intersection number of @xmath64 obtained by pushing @xmath64 off along the normal framing induced by the embedding of @xmath67 into @xmath62 .",
    "theorem 1 of @xcite ensures that the arf invariant of @xmath68 equals the modulo @xmath4 reduction of @xmath69 .",
    "( a nice introduction to the arf invariant can be found in the appendix of @xcite . ) unlike in @xcite , we are interested in immersed spheres rather than embedded surfaces .",

    "it is precisely this relationship that will supply the disks needed in the construction of second stage casson handles when the proof of casson s embedding theorem can not be implemented .",
    "applying the methods we have introduced , we can now provide a criterion for determining if a smoothly immersed sphere in a closed @xmath1-manifold decomposes as the union of a smoothly embedded disk and the first stage disk of a smoothly embedded casson handle .",
