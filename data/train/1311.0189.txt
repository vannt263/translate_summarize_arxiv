    "in practice , the boundary effect of flows is inevitable and requires careful treatment . on the other hand ,",
    "when people concentrate on physical mechanism of fluid , they hope that the boundary effect can be fully removed .",
    "for example , the oseen vortex in two - dimensional(2d ) fluid adopts the assumption of the infinite domain ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has also been shown in many previous investigations on how the boundary can influence the physical mechanism of flows .",
    "even when the region of main interest are fairly far away from the solid boundary , the drop speeds show about 15% difference in a thermocapillary migration study@xcite . in the research of the axisymmetrization of an isolated 2d vortex@xcite",
    ", a double - sized computing domain is adopted to alleviate the vortex overrotation caused by the periodical boundary in a fourier spectral simulation@xcite .",
    "hence , it is essential to adopt the infinite domain in such studies . when the infinite computing domain ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) is considered , one possible way is still using the finite - domain solver but with a certain mapping between ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "another way is something like the sponge - layer suggested in @xcite , which absorbs the incoming vortex filaments .",
    "the other way is more natural : laguerre or hermite functions are adopted to construct global approximation to functions defined on unbounded intervals .",
    "the normalized hermite function of degree @xmath5 is defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the usual ( unnormalized ) hermite polynomials ( for instance , see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath8 are orthogonal in @xmath9(@xmath1 , @xmath10 ) : @xmath11    in the last few decades , many investigations concerning the theory and application of hermite functions have been carried out , and an early review can be seen in @xcite . although the computing domain is infinite for hermite spectral methods , the region of our main interest is still finite",
    ". this fact led to the appearance of the most important concept in the practical sense : the scaling factor@xcite .",
    "there have been many hermite spectral ( or , pseudospectral ) studies which investigated partial differential equations from different fields @xcite .",
    "most researches in this field have so far dealt with one - dimensional problems , or multi - dimensional problems with only one hermite direction .",
    "one most recent paper @xcite deals with two - dimensional partial differential equations with two hermite directions , and takes an elliptic equation with a harmonic potential and a class of nonlinear wave equations into consideration .",
    "however , so far as we know , there has been no effort in solving the multi - dimensional navier - stokes ( ns ) equations with pure hermite spectral ( or hermite pseudospectral ) methods , and this is the main object of this paper .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : the numerical details are described in sec . 2 , and the performance of some validating tests is introduced in sec . 3 , and the discussions and some related future work are presented in sec .",
    "the 2d incompressible ns equations on the infinite domain @xmath12 \\times [ -\\infty , + \\infty]$ ] in terms of vorticity and stream function are written as @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the velocity , @xmath16 the kinematic viscosity , @xmath17 stream function , and vorticity @xmath18 .",
    "the stream function is related to velocity by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "since @xmath27 , the values of vorticity in our solver are defined on the grid points in the box of [ -@xmath28,@xmath28]@xmath30[-@xmath28,@xmath28 ] ( e.g. , see fig .",

    "is then transformed to the hermite spectral space with the following equation : @xmath38 where @xmath39is the hermite coefficients and @xmath40 wave numbers for @xmath41 and @xmath42 directions .",

    "transform  @xcite , only @xmath45 operations are needed .    in real simulations ,",
    "it is impossible to focus on the infinite domain , so we always concentrate on some small regions , e.g. @xmath46\\times[-l , l]$ ] .",

    "the value of @xmath66 is obtained by the combination of hermite transforms and the so - called de - aliasing technique by padding or truncation  @xcite .    as a comparison , the time integration for fourier or chebyshev spectral solver normally adopts a semi - implicit scheme .",
    "for example , the so - called abcn scheme is adopted in a fourier code  @xcite :    @xmath68    there are two reasons why the explicit time scheme is adopted in this solver :    * it has been shown that the spectral radii for the first and second hermite differentiation matrices are @xmath69 and o@xmath70 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this places rather weak stability restrictions on the hermite method , and for the standard heat equation  @xcite , a maximum step size in the time direction of order @xmath71 is required , whereas for fourier and chebyshev methods it is of order @xmath72 , @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "in the actual calculations this means that we need not even consider implicit time integration methods with the hermite method .",
    "* for the fourier spectral methods , the solution of poisson equation can be obtained with trivial efforts of @xmath51 operations , so the semi - implicit scheme only causes few extra computations . on the other hand ,",
    "the semi - implicit scheme of the hermite solver leads to an equation system similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) , which means extra nontrivial computation and computer memory .",
    "our numerical experiment shows that the adoption of the semi - implicit scheme in hermite simulations does not lead to a larger time step .",

    "three numerical experiments are performed :    * a steady axisymmetric solution for 2d ns equation ( subsection 3.1 ) ; * an unsteady axisymmetric solution with exact formula to describe its evolution ( subsection 3.2 ) ; * an unsteady non - axisymmetric solution without any exact formula to describe its evolutions , but its comparison is also easy since it has been widely adopted for validating new codes in many previous studies ( subsection 3.3 ) .",

    "[ fig : ngrids ] also shows that the gird points almost equally distribute near the center , so run1 and run2 can roughly be treated as simulations with the same resolution .",

    "for the two compared runs , the maximum vorticity of run2 is better conserved than run1 throughout the whole simulations . despite the similar effective resolutions , the spectral accuracy of our solver brings run2 a higher precision than that of run1 . on the other hand , the corresponding error in the vortex methods is about ten times larger than our results ( see , e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    it has been shown that for fourier spectral methods , some artificial boundary conditions such as the sponge - layer are required to absorb the incoming vortex filaments  @xcite . without any special treatment ,",
    "the fourier spectral method will cause about 17-degree overrotation at @xmath94 in the smaller domain simulation ( @xmath82 \\times [ -\\pi , \\pi]$ ] ) , and about 3-degree overrotation for the larger domain @xmath86 \\times [ -2\\pi , 2\\pi]$ ]  @xcite .",
    "however , no overrotation appears for run1 and run2 despite the different sizes of grid boxes because there is no boundary in our simulations .",
    "also , a good agreement is reached when the vorticity evolutions of our simulations are compared with those of vortex method ( figs . [",
    "fig : sdsize ] & [ fig : sumupn ] ) . at the late stages of simulations , more and more filaments are generated , and it becomes a challenge for any numerical scheme to capture all these fine vortex structures .",

    "the hermite spectral method is a grid - based method .",
    "if all non - zero vortices throughout simulations are confined in a small region , the spectral method has a higher accuracy than vortex methods . on the other hand ,",
    "if some vortex filaments are drifted away from the view box , the hermite spectral method requires a smaller scale factor to capture them .",
    "this means that the grid points are spread on a larger region , and more grid points are needed to guarantee the effective resolution within the region of our main interest .",
    "moreover , a lot of computing time is wasted since vorticity is zero on most grid points .",
