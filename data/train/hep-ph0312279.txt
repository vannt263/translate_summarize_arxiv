    "in this contribution to the ringberg workshop 2003 we shall discuss a topic of hadron physics : diffractive processes at high energies .",
    "we speak of a diffractive scattering process if one or more large rapidity gaps occur in the final state .",
    "examples are the reactions ( see figure 1 ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the incoming particles and @xmath2 can be particles or groups of particles .",
    "large rapidity gaps are required between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the object exchanged across the rapidity gaps",
    "is called the pomeron ( see for instance @xcite for the history and many refences ) .",
    "we can distinguish three classes of reactions involving pomerons .",
    "* soft reactions , where no large momentum transfers occur and no short distance physics is involved .",
    "examples are the following elastic scattering processes near the forward direction : @xmath7 in ( [ 1.4 ] ) we consider real photons . in all these cases the objects scattering are relatively large , with diameters of order @xmath8 to @xmath9 fm . * semi - hard reactions , where both large and small objects and/or momentum transfers are involved .",
    "examples are @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes the higgs particle . the virtual photon @xmath12 in ( [ 1.7 ] ) is supposed to have high @xmath13 , such that it is a small object probing the large proton .",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude of forward virtual compton scattering ( [ 1.7 ] ) is , of course , directly related to the structure functions of deep inelastic scattering . the diffractive central production of high @xmath14 jets ( [ 1.6 ] )",
    "was first discussed in @xcite where also the important concept of the partonic structure of the pomeron was introduced . * hard reactions , where all participating objects are small and",
    "ideally all momentum transfers should be large .",
    "the prime example for this is @xmath15 scattering with highly virtual photons @xmath16 here the observable quantity is the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude , that is the total cross section for @xmath17 going to hadrons @xmath18 this can be measured for instance at @xmath19 colliders , see figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the main question is now : what happens in a diffractive collision at high energy , that is when a pomeron is exchanged ? let us discuss this first for the prototype of such collisions , elastic hadron - hadron scattering : two hadrons come in , they interact , two hadrons go out ( figure 3a ) .    what happens in between ?",
    "this question was , of course , already studied before the advent of qcd . as an example of a pre - qcd approach",
    "let us discuss regge theory which is based on general analyticity and crossing properties of scattering amplitudes .",
    "the regge approach was developed in the nineteensixties and the answer provided then to our question was : an object is exchanged , the pomeron ( figure 3b ) , which corresponds to the rightmost singularity in the complex angular momentum plane . but to this date regge theory alone can not predict if the pomeron is a single regge pole , consists of two regge poles , is maybe a regge cut , and so on .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption that the pomeron seen in elastic hadron - hadron scattering is a simple regge pole works extremely well phenomenologically .",
    "we discuss as an example the donnachie - landshoff ( dl ) ansatz @xcite for the soft pomeron in regge theory .",
    "the dl pomeron is assumed to be effectively a simple regge pole .",
    "consider as an example @xmath20 elastic scattering @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the c.m .",
    "energy squared and the momentum transfer squared .",
    "the corresponding diagram is as in figure 3b , setting @xmath24 . in the dl",
    "ansatz the wavy line in figure 3b can be interpreted as an effective pomeron propagator given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the pomeron trajectory which is assumed to be linear in @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath27 with @xmath28 the pomeron intercept and @xmath29 the slope of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "the @xmath30 vertex , or regge residue factor , is assumed to have the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the isoscalar dirac electromagnetic form factor of the nucleons and @xmath33 the @xmath34-quark coupling constant . a good representation of the form factor is given by the dipole formula @xmath35 putting everything together we find from these rules the following expression for the scattering amplitude at large @xmath22 @xmath36 here @xmath37 are the spin indices .",
    "this formula ( [ 2.7 ] ) describes the data surprisingly well and from the fits one gets the following values for the dl - pomeron parameters : @xmath38 examples of the fits are shown in figures [ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] where in addition to the pomeron also non - leading regge exchanges are taken into account .",
    "= .6     elastic scattering at @xmath39 gev ( from @xcite),width=472 ]    note in figure [ figure4 ] that the tevatron measurements of @xmath40 at @xmath41 tev give two incompatible values .",
    "a resolution of this longstanding discrepancy would be very welcome .",
    "the simple dl ansatz failed , however , when applied to semi - hard diffractive reactions .",
    "a second pomeron had to be introduced @xcite in order to describe the structure functions of deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering , that is the total cross section of a highly virtual photon being absorbed by a proton .",
    "this second pomeron , the hard pomeron , was found to have an intercept much higher than the soft one : @xmath42 this , of course , spoiled the simplicity of the original dl - regge picture for the pomeron and raised a number of questions .",
    "is the hard pomeron also present in @xmath43 scattering",
    "? then it should show up at higher energies and maybe the lhc experiments will be able to tell .",
    "the biggest question for a theorist is , of course , how to understand all this in the framework of the theory of strong interactions , that is quantum chromodynamics , qcd .    clearly , the advent of qcd in the early nineteenseventies changed the whole scene in hadronic physics radically .",
    "we have since then a quantum field theory where in principle all hadronic phenomena should be derivable from the fundamental lagrangian .",
    "the question arose how to describe the pomeron in qcd .",
    "the first answers were given in @xcite .",
    "these authors modeled the pomeron as a perturbative two - gluon exchange ( figure 3c ) . however , this approach has problems .",
    "gluons in qcd are massless particles . exchanging one of them leads in perturbation theory to a long - range coulomb potential @xmath44 and a singularity in @xmath45 at @xmath46",
    "of course , in elastic hadron - hadron scattering one must exchange at least two gluons due to colour conservation .",
    "but this still gives a long - range potential falling with some power of @xmath47 and singularities in derivatives of @xmath45 at @xmath46 . from general principles we know the absence of massless hadrons to imply that @xmath45 is not singular at @xmath46 .",
    "this is , of course , consistent with experiment .",
    "the two - gluon exchange is the starting point of the bfkl approach @xcite where the interaction of the gluons is taken into account . instead of two gluons , one or even several gluon ladders , where the gluons themselves are `` reggeised '' , are exchanged ( figure 3d ) .",
    "even if this is usually called the perturbative pomeron of qcd , one should keep in mind that this pomeron represents a very sophisticated summation of an infinite number of diagrams in perturbation theory . for each diagram only the leading term for high energies is kept .",
    "there is no guaranty that the summation of the leading terms really gives the leading term of the full theory .",
    "also , this approach as it is based on perturbation theory does not generate a finite length scale for the potential and thus leads to singularities in derivatives of @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "but the bfkl pomeron should be important for hard diffractive reactions .    for hadron - hadron scattering the total cross section and the parameters describing @xmath45 , for instance the slope parameter @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 are dimensioned parameters .",
    "this fact suggested to some authors to consider the soft pomeron as a nonperturbative object in qcd , see @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "we shall treat this point of view in section 3 . in this approach",
    "hadrons scatter at small @xmath50 since the quarks in the hadrons feel the nonperturbative fluctuations of the gluon fields in the vacuum ( figure 3e ) .",
    "these fluctuations are assumed to be of gaussian nature in the stochastic vacuum model @xcite .",
    "we will show that the application of this model to high energy scattering allows us to extract from high energy data on @xmath45 values for the vacuum parameters , the gluon condensate , the correlation length , the non - abelian parameter and related to them the string tension .",
    "as we shall see , the results compare well to lattice calculations and other information on these parameters .",
    "in this section we will outline a microscopic approach towards hadron - hadron diffractive scattering ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consider as an example elastic scattering of two hadrons @xmath51 @xmath52 at high energies and small momentum transfer .",
    "we will look at reaction ( [ 3.1 ] ) from the point of view of an observer living in the `` femto - universe '' , that is we imagine having a microscope with resolution much better than 1 fm for observing what happens during the collision .",
    "of course , we should choose an appropriate resolution for our microscope .",
    "if we choose the resolution much too good , we will see too many details of the internal structure of the hadrons which are irrelevant for the reaction considered and we will miss the essential features .",
    "the same is true if the resolution is too poor . in @xcite",
    "we used a series of simple arguments based on the uncertainty relation to estimate this appropriate resolution .",
    "let @xmath46 be the nominal collision time of the hadrons in ( [ 3.1 ] ) in the c.m . system .",
    "this is the time when the hadrons @xmath53 and @xmath54 have maximal spatial overlap .",
    "let furthermore be @xmath55 the time when , in an inelastic collision , the first produced hadrons appear .",
    "we estimate @xmath56 fm from the lund model of particle production @xcite .",
    "then the appropriate resolution , that is the cutoff in transverse parton momenta @xmath57 of the hadronic wave functions to be chosen for describing reaction ( [ 3.1 ] ) in an economical way is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the c.m . energy .",
    "modes with higher @xmath57 can be assumed to be integrated out . with this",
    "we could argue that over the time interval @xmath60 the following should hold :    * the parton state of the hadrons does not change qualitatively , that is parton annihilation and production processes can be neglected for this time . *",
    "partons travel in essence on straight lightlike world lines . *",
    "the partons undergo `` soft '' elastic scattering .",
    "the strategy is now to study first soft parton - parton scattering in the femto - universe .",
    "there , the relevant interaction turns out to be mediated by the gluonic vacuum fluctuations .",
    "it is common belief that these have a highly nonperturbative character . in this way",
    "the nonperturbative qcd vacuum structure enters the picture for high energy soft hadronic reactions . once we have solved the problem of parton - parton scattering we have to fold the partonic @xmath61-matrix with the hadronic wave functions of the appropriate resolution ( [ 3.2 ] ) to get the hadronic @xmath61-matrix elements .",
    "here we can only give an outline of the various steps in this program .",
    "let us start by considering meson - meson scattering : @xmath62 we represent mesons as @xmath63 dipoles .",
    "we use standard techniques of quantum field theory , the lsz reduction formula and the functional integral .",
    "this allows us in a first step to represent the amplitude for the scattering of a @xmath63 colour dipole on another @xmath63 dipole at high energies in terms of a correlation function of two lightlike wegner - wilson loops ( figure [ figure6 ] ) .     and @xmath64 .",
    "the impact parameter is @xmath48 .",
    "( from @xcite),width=283 ]    the second step is to fold with the meson wave functions which describe the distribution of the colour dipoles in the mesons .",
    "the final formula reads @xmath65 t_{fi}&\\equiv&\\langle",
    "m_1(p_3),m_2(p_4 )    & = & -2is\\int \\textup{d}^2 b_t\\textup{d}^2x_t\\textup{d}^2y_te^{i\\vec q_t\\cdot \\vec b_t}w_1(\\vec x_t)w_2(\\vec y_t ) \\langle{\\cal{w}}_+(\\frac{1}{2}\\vec b_t,\\vec x_t ) { \\cal{w}}_-(-\\frac{1}{2}\\vec b_t,\\vec y_t)-1\\rangle_g . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath66 is the c.m .",
    "energy squared and @xmath67 is the momentum transfer , which is purely transverse in the high energy limit : @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the impact parameter .",
    "furthermore @xmath70 are the transverse sizes of the colour dipoles and @xmath71 describe the distribution of the colour dipoles in the mesons @xmath72 .",
    "the symbol @xmath73 denotes the functional integration over the gluonic degrees of freedom and @xmath74 are the wegner - wilson loops .",
    "the task is now to evaluate the functional integral @xmath75 in ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "surely we do not want to make a perturbative expansion there , remembering our argument of sect .",
    "2 . instead",
    ", we will turn to the stochastic vacuum model ( svm ) introduced in @xcite which provides a method to calculate in a certain approximation functional integrals in the nonperturbative domain of qcd . in the svm",
    "the qcd vacuum is described by three parameters    * @xmath76 , the gluon condensate introduced in @xcite , * @xmath77 , the nonabelian parameter , * @xmath78 , the vacuum correlation length .",
    "the svm relates these parameters to the string tension @xmath79 the svm has been applied extensively in low energy hadron physics with considerable success , see @xcite for a review .",
    "the qcd vacuum structure has also been investigated in lattice calculations @xcite . in these one",
    "finds the values for the vacuum parameters shown in the second column of table 1 where the value for the string tension is the input parameter . in the third column of the table",
    "the vacuum parameters of the lattice results are used as input and the resulting string tension is calculated from the svm relation ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "the outcome , @xmath80 mev , is very satisfactory and gives confidence that the svm catches some true features of the qcd vacuum .    .",
    "summary of the vacuum parameters @xmath76 : the gluon condensate , @xmath77 : the nonabelian parameter , @xmath78 : the correlation length , and of the string tension @xmath81 , as determined with different methods .",
    "quantities which are underlined are input values . in the second column",
    "we list the result of the lattice calculations @xcite , where @xmath81 is taken as input . in the third column the result of the string tension in the svm is listed , where the vacuum parameters @xmath82 are input , see ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "the fourth column lists the results for @xmath83 obtained in @xcite from the data on high energy proton - proton elastic scattering . here",
    "the value of @xmath76 is calculated using the svm relation ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "errors of the numbers can be estimated to be around 10 % . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     now we come back to high energy scattering . to evaluate the correlation function of the two lightlike wegner - wilson loops in ( [ 3.5 ] ) the svm was continued from euclidean space , where it was originally formulated , to minkowski space @xcite .",
    "this opened the possibility for many applications , see for instance @xcite . here",
    "i can just cite some results as examples .",
    "the differential cross section for proton - proton elastic scattering for @xmath84 gev@xmath85 was calculated in @xcite .",
    "the proton was considered as a quark - diquark system .",
    "thus the simple formula ( [ 3.5 ] ) for meson - meson scattering could be taken over with the diquarks replacing the antiquarks .",
    "the dipoles in the proton were assumed to have a gaussian distribution where the parameters can be related @xcite to those of the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the data could then be described reasonably well with the values for the vaccum parameters listed in column 4 of the table , see figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "note that the data extends over many orders of magnitude .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the shape of this @xmath23-distribution was quite sensitive to the vacuum parameters , in particular to @xmath77 .",
    "we see from the table that the vacuum parameters extracted from high - energy scattering are very well compatible with the values obtained from the lattice calculations .",
    "in particular , the value for the square root of the string tension @xmath86 mev is well in the range obtained from the study of heavy charmonium states .",
    "there one finds @xmath87 mev . in our opinion",
    "this gives support to the idea that high energy hadron - hadron scattering is dominated by nonperturbative qcd effects .",
    "but maybe @xmath43 is special .",
    "let us therefore look at one other result of this approach . in figure 8",
    "we show the pomeron contributions to various hadron - hadron total cross sections at @xmath88 gev as function of the hadron size parameter @xmath89 divided by @xmath90 .",
    "the curve , normalised to the @xmath43 point , gives the predicted functional dependence .",
    "again , the results are quite satisfactory .",
    "here we list some points which we consider important in the study of the pomeron in qcd .    * the phenomenological description in terms of the regge pole ansatz works surprisingly well .",
    "the challenge is to understand / derive this from qcd . * the soft pomeron and qcd :",
    "we have developed a calculational framework based on quantum field theoretic methods .",
    "we suggest that the soft pomeron is related to nonperturbative features of qcd , in particular to the qcd vacuum structure .",
    "the vacuum parameters like the string tension and the gluon condensate can be quantitatively extracted from high energy scattering data .",
    "* semi - hard diffractive phenomena , in particular the structure functions of deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering are well described for instance by the two pomeron model of donnachie and landshoff . is this directly related to the usual dglap evolution as suggested in @xcite ? what is the role of the bfkl , that is the perturbative , pomeron there ?",
    "is there saturation ?",
    "why does the dipole picture ( see @xcite , and the references therein ) work so well ?",
    "is there a chance to make nonperturbative calculations for the structure functions at small @xmath91 from first principles ?",
    "some steps in this direction have been presented in @xcite . for hard pomeron phenomena like the total cross section for @xmath92 hadrons presumably the bfkl approach should work .",
    "but there are problems of large higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "the experimental data @xcite from the lep experiments does not give evidence for the bfkl pomeron , so far . *",
    "what and where is the odderon , the @xmath93 partner of the pomeron ?",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of this question .",
    "experimental efforts @xcite to look for the odderon should be continued and extended .",
    "the author is grateful to the organisers of the ringberg workshop on hera physics 2003 for inviting him to give a talk there . the atmosphere there was stimulating and enjoyable .",
    "many of the results discussed in this contribution could not have been presented without the privilege the author had in being able to collaborate with many colleagues .",
