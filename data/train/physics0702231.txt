    "<S> analysis of equation  ( [ equ : fmax ] ) indicates that the magnitude of the force does not scale with the intrinsic optical @xmath0-factor ( @xmath74 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a result of the interplay between the stored optical energy and the degree of cavity loading : increasing @xmath74 moves @xmath75 $ ] further from the disk , which exactly cancels the @xmath0-enhancement of the internal field . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath74-independence of the force facilitates making systems insensitive to other nonlinearities which scale with @xmath74 ( such as the thermo - optic bistability of the current devices ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , early results with low-@xmath0 microdisks ( @xmath76 ) of roughly the same size ( @xmath77  @xmath3 m ) show large optical force effects with no observable thermo - optic bistability . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ equ : fmax ] ) also shows that the force scales inversely with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore smaller devices , even with lower quality factors , give rise to a larger maximum force . up to a factor of order unity , @xmath78 cancels , keeping the above scaling valid as devices approach the nano - scale . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of planar two - dimensional photonic crystal nanocavities@xcite with cubic - wavelength - scale mode volumes , the optical forces can be expected to be two orders of magnitude larger than in the microdisk studied here , approaching the nn level . </S>",
    "<S> such scaling behavior is applicable to a wide variety of geometries in which the ceodf acts on non - resonant dielectric objects in the near - field of the optical resonator and indicates an interesting path towards low - power , high - speed micro- and nano - scale actuators and transducers . </S>"
