    "liquid @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures are excellent examples of interacting bose and fermi liquids in nature . their behavior is dominated by quantum - mechanical exchange effects which involve not only identical particles , as in the pure liquids , but also interactions between particles obeying different statistics . as a result ,",

    "the thermal broadening of @xmath58 for an interacting fermi liquid is not known . however , in a strongly interacting fermi liquid @xmath103 is already small and @xmath58 already has a long tail .",
