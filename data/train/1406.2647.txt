    "wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium @xcite is a problem with an enormous range of aplications , from remote sensing to anderson localization @xcite . in many applications",
    ", the medium may be modelled as having a point - dependent , partially random speed of sound ( in this paper we shall discuss the scalar wave equation only ; the generalization of our work to the electromagnetic case is straightforward ) .",
    "there are two main objects to be computed , the self energy or mass operator , which is essentially the inverse square of the speed of propagation of the wave in the medium and thus necessary to compute the coherent part of the field , and the intensity operator , which is necessary to compute field fluctuations and thereby the incoherent scattering .",
    "we give precise definitions of both these objects below .",
    "these objects are constrained by the symmetries of the theory , namely flux conservation ( in the scalar case , in the electromagnetic case the relevant conserved quantity is energy ) and reciprocity @xcite .",
    "flux conservation implies a constraint which mass and intensity operator must satisfy , the so called ward identity @xcite .    in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "the problem is already too hard for a closed form solution , and one must resort to perturbation theory , the small parameter being associated to the strenght of random fluctuations in the speed of sound .",
    "field theory methods have been extensively applied in the development of suitable perturbative schemes @xcite . in the most straightforward formulation ,",
    "the field equation is first transformed into an integral equation which is then solved iteratively .",
    "one obtains in this way a linear mean field equation for the coherent field , a schwinger - dyson equation for the green function associated to the mean field equation ( which measures the response of the mean field to an external source ) and the bethe - salpeter equation for the two - point correlator of incoherent field fluctuations @xcite .",
    "one may write down these equations for a given realization of the stochastic speed of sound . they will contain kernels composed of products of the random part of the inverse square speed of sound at various points . replacing those products by their statistical averages one finally finds the mass and intensity operators , and therefore the final equations for the green function and the incoherent field correlations .",
    "the first nontrivial approximation yields the so - called nonlinear approximation for the mass operator and the ladder approximation for the intensity operator ( see below ) .",
    "these approximations are consistent with the ward identity but not with reciprocity . to restore reciprocity ( and also to account for other phenomena such as coherent backscattering and anderson localization )",
    "it is necessary to move to higher orders in perturbation theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in doing so ,",
    "one encounters expressions involving products of the random inverse square speed of sound at three or more different points .",
    "the usual perturbative approach computes these higher correlations as if the random fluctuations were gaussian , namely , higher correlations are factorized into binary correlations according to wick s theorem .",
    "the only information kept about the medium is the two point correlation of fluctuations .",
    "this is unsatisfactory as many relevant applications involve non gaussian fluctuations @xcite ; for example , the fluctuating speed of sound which is obtained by randomly distributing bubbles into an otherwise homogeneous medium @xcite is generally non gaussian , as we will show below .",
    "hori and coworkers have developed a statistical theory which may deal with non gaussian fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , their work is oriented mostly to computing the mass operator .",
    "our aim is to develop a formalism which is more suitable to the computation of both coherent and incoherent scattering , and in the process to present perturbation theory in a way which we believe is more compact and therefore easier to pursue to higher orders . as a particularly compelling feature ,",
    "the perturbative scheme to be presented below has flux conservation built in order by order in perturbation theory .    to achieve our goals",
    "we shall use martin , siggia and rose auxiliary field techniques @xcite to render the classical wave propagation problem into a `` quantum '' field theory one , and then frame this problem within the so - called schwinger - keldysh or closed time - path ( ctp ) formalism @xcite . by coupling the different fields and their binary products to fictitious forces , one obtains a ctp generating function for the field correlators of any order .",
    "the legendre transform of the ctp generating function yields the so - called two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action ( ea ) , whose arguments are both the mean fields and the correlators @xcite .",
    "variation of the effective action yields the schwinger - dyson and the bethe - salpeter equations , whereby it is straightforward to identify the mass and intensity operators .",
    "the key to the power of the method is that the seeming complexity of dealing with a larger number of fields ( auxiliary and ghost @xcite fields on top of the physical ones ) is overridden by the fact that the 2pi ea is built from feynman graphs with no external legs and which are two - particle irreducible , meaning that they remain connected after cutting any two internal legs .",
    "the number of these graphs at any finite order in perturbation theory is small enough that the computational effort stays manageable , and their structure is so tightly constrained that it is possible to provide proofs of key features , such as flux conservation , at any order @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we give a brief overview of the perturbative theory based on a direct iteration of the field equations .",
    "this allows us to give precise definitions of the key concepts , such as green functions , two - point correlations , schwinger - dyson and bethe - salpeter equations and the ward identity . in the following section , we present our approach , based on the martin - siggia - rose and ctp formalisms . in this section",
    "we work _ as if _ we had a closed - form expression for the 2pi ea . in the following section",
    "iv we discuss the loop expansion of the 2pi ea .",
    "then , as an application , we discuss the sensibility of the mass and intensity operators to the third order correlations in the inverse square speed of sound in the case of a medium composed of spherical , interpenetrating bubbles randomly dispersed into a homogeneous matrix .",
    "we conclude with some brief final remarks .",
    "we consider a complex scalar field @xmath1 obeying a wave equation    = -j [ 1 ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the speed of sound in the medium . in turn    ( x)=| ( x)+ ( x ) @xmath4 is a stochastic ( real ) variable with zero mean .",
    "we consequently split @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "there are a number of properties of the theory which can derived directly from the equations of motion , independently of any perturbative scheme .",
    "we begin by reviewing some of them .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) is linear and admits a green function    g_(x , y)=-(x - y ) [ 5 ] the background field @xmath7 does not appear in this equation , and so @xmath8 is background field independent .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is    ( x)=dyg_(x , y)j(y ) [ 6 ] taking the expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) we get    ( x)=dyg(x , y)j(y ) [ 7 ] where    g(x , y)=g_(x , y)[8 ] is independent of @xmath7 . taking the expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) we get    g(x , y)=-(x - y)- ^2(x)g_(x , y)[9 ] we _ define _ the self energy @xmath9 from the identity    ^2(x)g_(x , y)=dz(x , z)g(z , y ) [ 10 ] therefore    g(x , y)+dz(x , z)g(z , y ) = -(x - y ) [ 11 ] and also the mass operator @xmath10 from    ^2(x)(x)=dzq(x , z)(z ) [ 14 ] therefore the mean field equation reads ( x)+dzq(x , z)(z)=-j(x ) [ 12 ] on the other hand , acting with @xmath11 on both sides of eq .

    "we are interested in a situation where only @xmath1 and @xmath40 develop a nontrivial expectation value .",
