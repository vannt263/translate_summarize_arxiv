    "in this research , we have investigated the combined ivs troposphere zenith delay ( tzd ) series and focused on behavior trends and seasonal components with the help of singular spectrum analysis ( ssa ) @xcite .",
    "additional information on ssa method , its abilities and the corresponding software can be found on the site http://www.gistatgroup.com / cat/. with the help of this method we can :     recognize certain components in the equally spaced time series , which have been obtained from observations .",
    "the result of such procedure is decomposition of time series into components that usually can be identified as trends , periodical or oscillatory and noise components ;     extract components with the well - known period and estimate value of phase shift and variation of amplitude of pseudo - harmonic signals ;     find periodicities that are not known in advance ;     extract trends of different resolutions .",
    "natural decomposition of the time series is constructed on the base of the unique parameter ( the window length ) .",
    "grouping different subsets of the decomposition components one can obtain both the tendency and accurate trend ;     on the basis of the chosen components smooth out the initial data .",
    "contrast to the standard spectral analysis , where the basic functions are given a priory as the sines and cosines of the fourier method , in ssa they are determined from the very data to form orthogonal basis .",
    "the zenith total delay ( ztd ) is the sum of the zenith hydrostatic ( zhd ) and zenith wet delays ( zwd ) .",
    "the ssa method gives the opportunity to detect features of main ztd and zwd ( zd ) trends and to compare them with the main trends of other time series , such as hydrostatic zenith delay , wet zenith delay , pressure at the site , temperature at the site , water vapor pressure at site , which were taken from the vmf1 files provided by the igg .",
    "combined ivs time - series of zd , obtained at igg , were used for analysis @xcite .",
    "six vlbi stations ( gilcreek , kashima , kokee - kauai , onsala , westford , wettzell ) with the longest time series of troposphere zenith delays were selected for studying .",
    "linear interpolation of data was carried out to get equally spaced series with the step of 0.01 year which was used for ssa .",
    "for all time series we used the same time interval 1984.88  2004.87 , series length n=2000 points ( 20 years ) , and the maximum window length m = n/2=1000 .",
    "after decomposing with ssa method in all series the trends hereafter referred to as trend ssa , annual and semiannual components were found .",
    "figures  [ fig : trend1 ] and  [ fig : trend2 ] show zd trends as obtained by ssa from the combined ivs series and their linear approximation .",
    "the fact that the stations located in the same geographic region ( onsala and wettzell ) reveal similar trend features is of a special interest .",
    "moreover , all trends have the same small curving about year 1995 .",
    "original series obtained by analysis centers bkg , gsfc , iaa , mao show the same properties , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trendwett ] for wettzell as an example .",
    "=    =    = 0.6    it is interesting to compare non - linear trends found in the zd with those in the meteorological parameters . for this purpose ,",
    "decomposition of the meteorological parameters for wettzell and gilcreek has been made using ssa .",
    "figure  [ fig : trendzhd ] shows the trends for the hydrostatic zenith delay , pressure at the site from the vmf1 and ztd - zwd computed from the ivs combined series .",
    "the coincidence of all these curves is obvious for wettzell . for gilcreek one can see the difference in shape of the curves .",
    "figure  [ fig : trendzwd ] shows the trends for wet zenith delay , temperature at the site , water vapor pressure at the site from the vmf1 and zwd .",
    "the zwd trend is very close to trend of water vapor pressure for the wettzell .",
    "but for the gilcreek the similar curves do not show such an agreement .",
    "the gilcreek is the only station where we failed to extract the trend of the site temperature series .",
    "= 0.495 = 0.495    = 0.45 = 0.45    =    =    figures  [ fig : annualzwd ] and  [ fig : semiannualzwd ] show the annual and semi - annual components zwd for researched stations .",
    "the components have a steady phase but variations of amplitude .",
    "it should be mentioned that the contribution of the semiannual component is comparatively small , near noise level , and therefore this component needs more careful study",
    ". for kokee - kauai semiannual component was not found , and so for ztd at onsala . for kashima , the amplitude of the semiannual component is larger in the beginning of the time interval than at the rest of interval .",
    "in this paper , we have examined an ability of the ssa method in analysis of the zenith troposphere delay . non - linear trends and variations of the amplitude of seasonal components",
    "have been detected .",
    "some interesting peculiarities in their behavior have individual character for every stations of site .",
    "comparison of the trends with meteorological parameters also is presented to show possible similarities that deserve further investigations .",
