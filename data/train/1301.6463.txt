    "conversely , it is easy to see that a symmetry action of a geodesic is still a geodesic",
    ". therefore we complete the proof of theorem [ chaofgeo ] .    actually , the geodesics ( [ gode1 ] ) for @xmath311 are the reverse of the geodesics ( [ gode2 ] ) for @xmath312 .",
    "that is , they run in the reverse direction of each other .",
    "first we show the uniqueness .",
    "let @xmath88 be a normal parametrized surface with @xmath87 and @xmath79 as the coefficients .",
    "that is , @xmath313defining the unique lift @xmath314 of @xmath70 to @xmath19 as @xmath315we would like to compute the darboux derivative @xmath316 of @xmath314 : by the moving frame formula ( [ movingframe ] ) , we see that @xmath317this implies that @xmath318hence , comparing the coefficients and note that @xmath319 , we have @xmath320and @xmath321from ( [ coeff1 ] ) and ( [ coeff2 ] ) , we get @xmath322on the other hand , again using the moving frame formula ( [ movingframe ] ) , @xmath323note again that @xmath324 , we have @xmath325comparing the above two formulae , we obtain @xmath326 in particular , combining ( [ darder1 ] ) and ( [ darder2 ] ) , we get the darboux derivative @xmath327 which is @xmath328this completes the proof of the uniqueness .",
    "now we prove the existence .",
    "suppose @xmath89 and @xmath329 are functions defined on @xmath80 . define a @xmath226-valued one form @xmath330 by @xmath331then we have @xmath332and @xmath333therefore",
    "we get that @xmath330 satisfies the integrability condition @xmath334 if and only lf @xmath87 and @xmath79 satisfy the integrability condition ( [ intcons1 ] ) . therefore , by theorem [ ft2 ] , there exists a map @xmath335such that @xmath336 .",
    "thus , by the moving frame formula ( [ movingframe ] ) , we see that @xmath88 is a map with @xmath87 and @xmath79 as its coefficients .",

    "we call @xmath70 and @xmath68 a normal parametrization and a normal coordinates around @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "[ norcor ] the normal coordinates is determined up to a transformation of the form @xmath341for some smooth functions @xmath342 such that @xmath343 .",

    "we have @xmath347 expand @xmath348 . by the first identity of ( [ tlofnorpar ] ) , we have @xmath349",
    "since @xmath33 is regular , we see that @xmath350 around @xmath33 , we conclude from the above formula @xmath351 for some function @xmath352 .",
    "in addition , comparing the coefficient of @xmath340 , we have @xmath353 hence @xmath354 for some function @xmath355 .",
    "finally we compute @xmath356 this completes the proof .",
    "recall that by means of a normal parametrization @xmath70 , we compute the darboux derivative @xmath357 as ( [ darder9 ] ) .",
    "one can define four one - forms on @xmath133 locally as follows : @xmath358 where functions @xmath359 and @xmath93 are defined as ( [ coeofform ] ) .",
    "let @xmath344 be another normal coordinates around @xmath33 , we have    [ propofform ] @xmath360    from the definition of normal coordinates , we see that @xmath361 . by definition @xmath362 where @xmath363 and @xmath364 by lemma [ norcor ] , there exists functions @xmath355 and @xmath352 such that @xmath365 we compute the transformation laws of the coefficients of the fundamental forms : @xmath366 similarly , we have @xmath367 on the other hand , note that @xmath368 , hence @xmath369 .",
    "thus @xmath370 similarly we have @xmath371 from the transformation laws ( [ tlofc ] ) , ( [ tlofc1 ] ) , ( [ tlofc2 ] ) and ( [ tlofc3 ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath360 this finishes the proof of the proposition .    define @xmath372 and @xmath373 , then from ( [ tlofc1 ] ) , we see that @xmath374 . actually , @xmath110 is the function defined on the non - singular part of @xmath133 such that @xmath375 .",
    "up to a sign , @xmath102 is a function which is independent of the choice of the normal coordinates , hence an invariant of @xmath133 on the non - singular part .",
    "similarly , from ( [ tlofc2 ] ) , so is for @xmath93 , which actually is the @xmath33-mean curvature .    note that if we restrict us to choose normal coordinates with respect to a fixed orientation of the characteristic foliation on the nonsingular part , we see , from the proof of proposition [ propofform ] , that @xmath376 and @xmath377 . that is , the sign appearing is due to the different choice of orientation .    besides the two invariants @xmath110 and @xmath93 , we now proceed to introduce another invariant of @xmath133 , which is defined on all of @xmath133 , not just on the non - singular part .",
    "again , from proposition [ propofform ] , it is easy to see that @xmath378 therefore the form @xmath379 is again independent of the choice of a normal coordinates , hence also an invaiant of @xmath133    let @xmath131 be the adapted metric on @xmath0 .",
    "then we have @xmath380 on the non - singular part of @xmath133 .",
    "this lemma is a easy consequence of the first one of the moving frame formula ( [ movingframe ] ) .    in the following section",
    ", we will show that the form @xmath381 is completely determined by all @xmath382 and @xmath93 .",
    "we therefore obtain a complete set of invariants for surfaces on the non - singular part .",
    "let @xmath65 be an oriented surface and suppose @xmath141 be an embedding .",

    "for each non - singular point @xmath384 , we specify an orthonormal frame by @xmath385 , here @xmath386 is tangent to the characteristic foliation and @xmath104 . a darboux frame is a moving frame which is smoothly defined on @xmath65 , except those singular points , hence giving a lifting of @xmath124 to @xmath19 which is defined by @xmath70 .",
    "now we would like to compute the darboux derivative @xmath387 of @xmath70 . in the following , instead of @xmath387",
    ", we still use @xmath388to express the darboux derivative .",

    "[ prop1 ] we have @xmath399    note that @xmath400",

    "therefore , there exists a function @xmath410 such that @xmath411by ( [ baeq2 ] ) and ( [ baeq3 ] ) , we get @xmath412similarly , by ( [ baeq2 ] ) , ( [ baeq3 ] ) and ( [ baeq4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath413these complete the proof .",
    "let @xmath108 be the gaussian curvature of the induced metric @xmath126 , hence we have @xmath414 where @xmath415 is the area form @xmath416 .",
