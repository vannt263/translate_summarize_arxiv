    "long - range dipolar interactions between the local magnetisation and that of the remainder of a liquid sample play a significant role in determining nuclear spin dynamics at high magnetisation densities .",
    "they introduce a non - local contribution to the evolution of magnetisation and give rise to complex non - linear behaviour .",
    "spectacularly abrupt decays of nmr free induction signals have been observed at large tip angles in several laser - polarised liquid systems @xcite , and have been explained by the development of unstable inhomogeneous magnetisation patterns that grow exponentially in time @xcite .",
    "the onset of precession instabilities is a generic feature of highly magnetised systems , and is related to turbulent spin motion @xcite .",
    "it is potentially relevant to understanding the dynamics of polarised quantum fluids , and is becoming increasingly important in high - field @xmath2h - based nmr spectrometry where chaotic spatiotemporal behaviour occurs under the joint action of distant dipolar fields and strong radiation damping @xcite .",
    "we recently demonstrated that the magic sandwich ( ms ) , a sophisticated pulse sequence designed to refocus the magnetisation lost through broadening by local dipolar fields in solids , can be successfully used to fight the deleterious effect of distant dipolar fields in highly magnetised liquids and to investigate the spatiotemporal development of instabilities @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrated that it is possible to achieve dynamic stabilisation of transverse precession in laser - polarised he mixtures using a series of ms cycles to periodically refocus the dipolar interactions . in this paper , we report preliminary results that establish the potential of multiple - echo ms - based nmr sequences for spin diffusion measurements at high magnetisation densities , and confirm the fact that conventional spin echo techniques completely fail to achieve this goal @xcite .",
    "polarised samples are prepared by condensation of optically pumped @xmath3he gas into superfluid @xmath4he in a 1 metre - long pyrex glass cell . @xmath3he gas is continuously injected ( at mbar pressures with a flow rate of order 0.1  @xmath5mol / s ) into a room temperature volume where laser optical pumping is performed , as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it then flows down a narrow tube into a 0.44  cm@xmath3 spheroidal volume partly filled with liquid @xmath4he at temperature @xmath7 1.15  k. cs coatings are used to avoid wall relaxation , and bulk dipole - dipole relaxation times reach several hours in our dilute samples ( @xmath3he molar fractions @xmath8  1 - 5% ) @xcite . by adjusting the @xmath3he molar fraction and nuclear polarisation ( that can be as high as 40% ) , we control the magnetisation density @xmath9 in the sample . in the following , @xmath9",

    "nmr excitation by 90@xmath15 rf pulses induces an irreversible loss of this out - of - equilibrium magnetisation , so that a new batch of polarised gas has to be condensed for each experiment .",
    "the cryogenic apparatus includes a commercial aluminum and fiberglass dewar and a homemade non - magnetic insert .",
    "the lower end of the cell lies inside a stainless - steel vacuum can , and is thermally anchored to a copper 1  k - pot via bundles of enameled copper wires that do not allow for eddy current loops .",
    "low frequency nmr ( 74  khz ) is performed in a 2.3  mt magnetic field ( shimmed to 20  ppm over the sample ) using crossed coils .",
    "the receive coil is capacitively tuned with a very low @xmath16 factor ( @xmath17 ) to avoid radiation damping .",
    "the transmit coil is actively shielded to avoid joule heating by eddy currents induced in the surrounding metallic parts during intense cw rf excitation @xcite . with the shield coil in place , the rf field outside of the transmit coil is dramatically reduced and , e.g. , the measured heat load on the 1  k - pot is more than two orders of magnitude lower . shielding also minimises field distortions and improves rf homogeneity ( @xmath18  ppm over the sample ) . in - house",
    "pc - controlled analog hardware allows for flexible control of hard pulse sequences .",
    "spin diffusion coefficients are usually measured by monitoring the attenuation of echo amplitudes in the presence of a uniform applied gradient .",
    "conventional spin echo techniques are inefficient in highly magnetised liquids .",
    "the ( quadratic ) effect of dipolar interactions actually remains unchanged throughout the sample when a 180@xmath15 rf pulse is applied to rotate the local magnetisation .",
    "the decay of the average transverse magnetisation is thus expected to remain dominated by dipolar - induced instabilities at high magnetisation densities .",
    "indeed , early attempts to generate single hahn spin echoes and carr - purcell spin echo trains in highly polarised @xmath3he-@xmath4he dilute mixtures have led to the observation of multiple echoes @xcite and of non - exponential decay @xcite , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the differences in time evolution of signals obtained with a conventional spin echo sequence at high and low magnetisation densities for two different values of the applied gradient @xmath19 .",

    "mono - exponential decays of the echo amplitudes are observed . at high magnetisations ( traces b and d ) ,",
    "the echo shapes are strongly altered and the much faster decay is no longer exponential , as previously reported @xcite . since 180@xmath15 pulses only remove the linear phase dispersion introduced by the applied gradient , dipolar instabilities quickly take over and induce a very strong signal decay . at low @xmath19 , minor refocussing",
    "is achieved by the 180@xmath15 pulses and the echo envelope is reminiscent of a typical dipolar - induced signal decay . at high @xmath19 ,",
    "the large gradient - induced frequency spread over the sample ( @xmath28 ) dominates the very short measured fid lifetime .",
    "however , irreversible signal loss occurs during subsequent free evolution due to the development of unstable magnetisation patterns .",
    "dipolar - induced phase dispersion can be refocussed by continuous application of appropriately phased intense rf pulses that mix the longitudinal and transverse components of the magnetisation in such a way that it undergoes a time - reversed evolution , at half the pace of free evolution @xcite .",
    "successful implementation and use of the original magic sandwich pulse scheme in the context of liquid nmr has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "we use a slightly modified ms cycle , @xmath29-@xmath30 , that incorporates an additional 180@xmath15 rotation to refocus the gradient - induced linear phase dispersion .",
    "periodic refocussing is achieved using a repeated magic sandwich  ( rms ) sequence @xmath31 , where the duration of the ms cycle is @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the rms sequence is thus analogous to a conventional spin echo sequence where the 180@xmath15 pulses have been replaced by ms cycles .",
    "it leads to the formation of so - called magic echoes with a time period equal to @xmath33 .",

    "width=491 ]    all echoes have the expected shapes and exhibit monoexponential decay at a rate that does not depend on @xmath25 .",
    "nmr signals are efficiently recovered at all magnetisation densities since frequent time reversal heals spatial variations of magnetisation that develop during periods of free evolution .    for both cpmg and rms echo trains , experimental decay rates @xmath26 are obtained from an exponential fit to the decay of the squared amplitude of the fourier transform of the band - pass filtered nmr signals .",
    "this method preserves the accuracy of the analysis down to low signal - to - noise ratios .",

    "the expected diffusion - induced decay rate for spin echo amplitudes is @xcite : @xmath41 which is less than @xmath36 because the dephasing action of @xmath19 is arrested during each ms cycle @xcite . assuming that the decay rates measured for the strongest @xmath19 only result from diffusion - induced attenuation ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , traces c and d in fig .",

    "we believe that rf heating of the sample ( of order 1  mk / s during rms sequences ) has negligible influence on signal decay . in our experiment ,",
    "evaporation hardly modifies the @xmath0he molar fraction ( a 140  ppm / s relative decrease of @xmath22 is estimated from thermodynamic data @xcite ) .",
