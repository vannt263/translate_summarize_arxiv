    "in the quantities related to kaon physics such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the first three are constructed straightforwardly on the lattice . however , in actual numerical simulations , there are several potential sources of systematic error , namely explicit breaking of chiral symmetry , scaling violation , finite volume effect and quenching effect .",
    "although many efforts have been made to decrease these errors , yet more numerical simulations should be done to attain a conclusion .",

    "in particular , we estimate the effect of operator mixing in the calculation of @xmath0 through the non - perturbative calculation of the renormalization factors which weight contributions of the mixing operators .",
