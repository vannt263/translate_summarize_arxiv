    "it has been proposed that the neutrons making up the inner crust and core of a neutron star display superfluid - like behaviour @xcite . they are compressed to such a high density that they act like composite bosons , forming bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairs which condense into the ground state below a critical temperature @xmath2 and behave like terrestrial superfluids ( e.g. @xmath3he ) .",
    "calculations of the pair interaction and energy gap suggest that different types of cooper pairs populate the crust and the core of a neutron star , @xmath1 ( triplet ) pairs in the core and @xmath0 ( singlet ) pairs in the crust @xcite .",
    "superfluidity enhances neutron star cooling , reduces the heat capacity of the star , and suppresses neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "in addition , pulsar glitches ( discontinuous spin - up events ) are attributed to the motion of superfluid vortex lines ; these lines tend to be pinned to the nuclei in the stellar crust and sudden , large - scale creep of these lines from one pinning site to another may be responsible for glitches @xcite    macroscopic phase coherence endows a superfluid with frictionless flow and irrotationality @xcite .",
    "irrotationality leads to formation of discrete quantized vortices if the fluid rotates .",
    "this behaviour is well known and observed in terrestrial samples of superfluid @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "landau ( 1941 ) put forth what is known as the two - fluid model ( where @xmath3he is modelled as two separate components , the inviscid superfluid and the viscous normal fluid ) to explain the various phenomena observed in superfluid flows such as second sound ( an entropy - temperature wave , where the two components move in opposite directions , induced by a temperature gradient ) and the fountain effect @xcite .",
    "this hydrodynamic model is successful and has been polished to a high degree of sophistication , taking into account more and more effects , such as the motion of quantized vortices and the drag forces they exert @xcite .",
    "superfluidity in @xmath4he , on the other hand , was first observed more recently @xcite ( see also @xcite for a first - person account of its discovery ) and the search for a complete hydrodynamic theory continues ; for a comprehensive and up - to - date account , see @xcite .",
    "@xmath4he superfluid is a condensate of @xmath4he cooper pairs .",
    "the generally accepted theory of @xmath4he superfluidity postulates @xmath5-wave pairing with spin angular momentum @xmath6 and orbital angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "experiments show that there are two distinct phases of superfluid @xmath4he , known as he - a and he - b .",
    "he - b occupies the @xmath7 state ; it is isotropic and behaves like @xmath3he superfluid .",
    "he - a occupies the @xmath1 state ; the axis of the orbital angular momentum defines a preferred direction ( generally denoted as @xmath8 ) , breaking the symmetry of the ground state .",
    "this anisotropy manifests itself as a ` texture ' , defined to be the vector field tangent to the local direction of the pair angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the texture in the lowest energy state ( undisturbed he - a ) is uniform , but heat and fluid flows , applied electromagnetic fields , and container walls deform it .",
    "the texture , in turn , inhibits flows and heat transport perpendicular to itself .",
    "hence , the presence of textures modifies the characteristics of any flows induced upon the fluid .    a recent laboratory experiment with superposed he - a and he - b in differential rotation ( at an interface stabilised by an applied magnetic field ) indicates that the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability at the interface plays a significant role in triggering transfer of circulation from he - a to the initially irrotational he - b , spinning up the he - b sample ; this is detected as discrete jumps in nuclear magnetic resonance absorption signals @xcite .",
    "this exciting result suggests that a similar process may occur at the crust - core superfluid interface in a neutron star , with important implications for pulsar glitches .",
    "in section 2 we present an analysis of the kh instability involving two superposed superfluids , taking as our starting point the two - fluid model , modified for @xmath4he .",
    "our analysis extends earlier work in two ways : we treat the flow of entropy in the system self - consistently ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and consider two different superposed fluids ( each with its own superfluid and normal fluid components ) in relative motion , not the superfluid and normal fluid components of one fluid @xcite . in section 3 , we apply our kh dispersion relation to the experiment conducted by blaauwgeers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and to an idealised neutron star model .",
    "this work complements an analysis by @xcite of the two - stream instability , a different process involving two interpenetrating , isotropic superfluids , which is also a possible triggering mechanism for glitches .",
    "we restrict our attention to the hydrodynamic regime , where disturbances of the equilibrium are much slower than the typical particle collision time .",
    "the nondissipative hydrodynamic equations describing an anisotropic superfluid are ( @xcite )    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    the interface is defined to be at @xmath19 , the zeroth order flows are in the @xmath20-direction , and the velocities in ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are evaluated at the unperturbed interface . in ( 1)(10 ) , @xmath21 are the super- and normal fluid densities respectively , @xmath22 is the gravitational acceleration ( directed towards negative @xmath23-axis ) , @xmath24 is the surface tension force per unit length for the normal and superfluid interfaces respectively ( directed towards the positive @xmath23-axis ) , @xmath25 is the perturbed @xmath23-coordinate of the normal and superfluid interfaces , @xmath5 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denote the pressure , temperature , specific entropy , and mass of an individual constituent particle , @xmath8 is the unit vector tangent to the texture ( in other words , along the direction of the pair angular momentum ) , @xmath29 are the superfluid and normal fluid velocities , and @xmath30 is the counterflow velocity .",
    "note that there is no unique equation of state relating @xmath31 and @xmath5 ; these quantities evolve independently through the heat transfer ( energy ) equation ( 3 ) .",
    "an isotropic superfluid is a special case , in which one sets @xmath32 in ( 1)(10 ) .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the equations of motion governing the normal fluid and the superfluid , are modified with respect to a classical fluid by adding the terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these terms come from the gradient of the superfluid chemical potential @xmath35 . in a classical fluid",
    ", one simply has @xmath36 , whereas in a superfluid , the entropy gradient can drive flows separately from the pressure gradient , because entropy is carried only by the normal fluid component .",
    "the @xmath37 term leads to effects like second sound , a temperature - entropy wave which differs from ` first sound ' , the usual pressure - density wave @xcite .",
    "in addition , the first term on the right - hand side of ( 2 ) describes the force exerted by the texture in an anisotropic superfluid when the texture is bent ; the ground state of the superfluid far from any walls corresponds to uniform @xmath8 ( see section 2.2 ) , so the texture ` stiffens ' the system and opposes flows which might bend it @xcite .",
    "equation ( 3 ) is our ( non - dissipative ) equation of entropy transport [ as for the electron - and - muon fluid in @xcite ]",
    ". equation ( 4 ) describes the evolution of the texture . bending the texture ( i.e. changing the direction of @xmath8 ) shifts the energy gap and the momentum distribution of normal fluid excitations , which then reacts back on the texture itself .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of ( 4 ) derives from the dependence of the free energy density ( which is a function of @xmath38 ) on the superfluid velocity @xcite .",
    "the remaining equations are standard : ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) enforce incompressibility , ( 7 ) and ( 8) enforce mass continuity , and ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ensure that no fluid particles cross the interface , i.e. the fluids are immiscible @xcite .    for simplicity , we make some approximations .",
    "we set all coefficients of conductivity on the right - hand side of ( 3 ) to zero .",
    "we also neglect the anisotropy in density for flows along and transverse to the texture , and we omit terms involving changes in free energy as the local texture changes , i.e. we postulate that the texture is in thermodynamic equilibrium to the zeroth order . in reality , ( 2 ) features a heat current term proportional to @xmath39 , with the thermal conductivities for flows parallel and perpendicular to @xmath8 scaling as @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , where @xmath42 is the ( isotropic ) conductivity at the critical temperature .",
    "similarly , although the physical density of the fluid at any point is uniquely defined , the anisotropic texture modifies the mass current to become @xmath43 perpendicular to @xmath8 and @xmath44 parallel to @xmath8 .",
    "this counterintuitive property , which arises because the two - fluid description is an effective theory where it is not possible to label individual @xmath4he atoms as _ s _ or _",
    "n _ , is more pronounced at lower temperatures , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 as @xmath47 , for example . here , @xmath48 is the effective mass of each constituent particle and @xmath49 is the maximum gap parameter , the energy needed to excite one pair out of the ground state @xcite .",
    "we investigate the situation where an isotropic superfluid is superposed on an anisotropic superfluid and moves relative to it with a constant and uniform velocity .",
    "we follow the derivation of the dispersion relation of the classical kh instability described by @xcite , assuming continuous stratification of the fluid variables in the top and bottom layers with a discontinuous jump at the interface . the normal and superfluid components interpenetrate ; their surfaces are allowed to oscillate with different amplitudes , but must be in phase with each other .",
    "it is clear that a situation where all the quantities are uniform and constant in time satisfies ( 1)(10 ) .",
    "we take this equilibrium solution as our starting point . a uniform and constant texture , along with uniform and constant normal fluid velocity , satisfies ( 4 ) identically .",
    "a nonuniform but constant texture is also possible .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the most energetically favourable texture for a superfluid in a spherical container is one where the texture lines radiate from a singularity on the wall , called a ` bouquet ' , ` fountain ' , or ` boojum ' @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume a uniform and constant texture without any singularities , as well as uniform and constant fluid velocities .",
    "we linearise ( 1)(10 ) , and take all perturbed ( first order ) quantities to be proportional to @xmath50 , assuming that the wavelength of the perturbation is much smaller than the length - scale over which the texture changes .",
    "we take all zeroth order quantities ( except temperature , which is the same for both fluids ) to be constant and uniform except in the @xmath23 direction , allowing for vertical stratification .",
    "the zeroth - order shear velocity is chosen in the @xmath20 direction . from ( 2 ) , one can see that , given a spatially uniform zeroth - order texture that is also constant in time , the textural contribution to the momentum flux is of quadratic order and thus negligible .",
    "one can now ignore the textural effects on the fluid flows , although the first - order texture still evolves according to ( 4 ) .",
    "writing @xmath51 , we then obtain    @xmath52,\\ ] ]    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55,\\ ] ]    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60z'_{n , s}=w_{n , s}(z=0),\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 are the zeroth - order shear velocities ( in the @xmath20 direction as defined previously ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the perturbed velocities in the @xmath20 , @xmath64 , and @xmath23 directions , @xmath65 is the first order pressure , @xmath66 is the first order temperature , @xmath67 is the first order density , and other quantities with the superscript ` 0 ' are of zeroth order .",

    "( 12 ) , ( 14 ) , and ( 15 ) we eliminate @xmath66 and @xmath65 , while @xmath69 and @xmath70 are eliminated using ( 17 ) .",
    "we then obtain the bulk fluid equations ( equations which are valid away from the interface ) from ( 13 ) and ( 16 ) , after using ( 18 ) to eliminate @xmath71 and ( 19 ) to eliminate @xmath25 .",
    "for the bulk fluids , where all zeroth - order velocities are constant and uniform everywhere , one obtains the following equations which are valid throughout the superfluids and normal fluids away from the interface :    @xmath72-\\frac{\\rho^0_s\\rho^0_n}{\\rho^0}k_x(u_s - u_n)k^2w_s\\ ] ] @xmath73\\}\\ ] ] @xmath74+gk^2(d\\rho^0_n)\\frac{w_n}{-\\omega+k_xu_n}-\\frac{\\rho^0_s\\rho^0_n}{\\rho^0}k_x(u_s - u_n)k^2w_n\\ ] ] @xmath75\\}\\ ] ] @xmath76 and    @xmath77+gk^2(d\\rho^0_s)\\frac{w_s}{-\\omega+k_xu_s}-\\frac{\\rho^0_s\\rho^0_n}{\\rho^0}k_x(u_s - u_n)k^2w_s\\ ] ] @xmath73\\}\\ ] ] @xmath78 @xmath79-\\frac{\\rho^0_s\\rho^0_n}{\\rho^0}k_x(u_s - u_n)k^2w_n\\ ] ] @xmath75\\}.\\ ] ]    from ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , we see that , away from the interface , where @xmath61 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are constant and uniform , @xmath82 and @xmath83 must satisfy    @xmath84(d^2w_n - k^2w_n),\\ ] ]    and @xmath85(d^2w_s - k^2w_s)=\\frac{\\rho^0_n\\rho^0_s}{\\rho^0}k_x(u_s - u_n)(d^2w_n - k^2w_n).\\ ] ] one nontrivial , stratified solution is @xmath68 : @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , where the fluids on top ( bottom ) are labelled with subscript @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "another solution , @xmath90 , describes a wave propagating in the bulk fluid ; it does not describe an instability , so we are not concerned with it here .",
    "the zeroth - order quantities ( except @xmath26 , by assumption ) jump across the interface .",
    "we integrate the equations across the interface to analyse the interfacial waves .",
    "many of the terms in the above equations are of the form @xmath91 , where both @xmath92 and @xmath93 are discontinuous functions .",
    "direct integration of such terms is impossible in general ( see appendix a ) .",
    "however , if one assumes all the zeroth - order quantities change over the same length scale @xmath94 in passing from the top fluid to the bottom fluid , we can integrate ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) term by term from @xmath95 to @xmath96 and then squeeze @xmath94 to zero in a mathematically regular way .",
    "one then substitutes the solutions for @xmath97 into the integrated ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) and obtains two equations involving the oscillation amplitudes @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the two equations must be compatible , i.e. linearly dependent .",
    "the condition for compatibility gives the following dispersion relation for waves at the interface :    @xmath100\\ ] ] @xmath101\\ ] ] @xmath102\\ ] ] @xmath103,\\ ] ] with    @xmath104 @xmath105+\\frac{1}{8}(s_b+s_a)(\\rho^0_b+\\rho^0_a)(\\rho^0_{s , b}+\\rho^0_{s , a}),\\ ] ] @xmath106\\ ] ] @xmath107,\\ ] ] @xmath108\\ ] ] @xmath109,\\ ] ] @xmath110    the dispersion relation ( 24 ) is a quartic in @xmath111 .",
    "it is related to the dispersion relation of the classical kh instability as follows . in ( 24 ) , we have terms involving superfluid and normal fluid quantities , as well as new terms @xmath112 and @xmath113 which involve the ratios of the bulk entropies .",
    "if the superfluid and normal fluid interfaces are decoupled , one must treat the interfaces separately using the classical analysis , i.e. excluding ( 3 ) and entropy terms in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "for example , if either component is negligible , setting either @xmath114 or @xmath115 satisfies ( 24 ) identically , or if the interfaces are allowed to oscillate separately , cross terms like @xmath116 in ( 1 ) or @xmath117 in ( 2 ) are absent .",
    "if neither component is negligible but the counterflow tends to zero , setting @xmath118 to zero in ( 24 ) yields the classical limit , where the components essentially move together as a classical fluid and entropy does not affect stability . if neither component is negligible and there is significant counterflow , one must use the two - fluid dispersion relation ( 24 ) , as there is no classical analogue .        in order to understand the onset of the superfluid kh instability , we first review the classical case .",
    "the kh instability occurs when two superimposed layers of fluids with different densities are in relative motion .",
    "when the velocity shear exceed a critical value , the resulting pressure gradient ( from bernoulli s law ) between the peaks and troughs of an interfacial wave overcomes the surface tension and gravity and the mode grows exponentially . in the classical instability , the interface oscillates at a frequency    @xmath119^{1/2}\\ ] ]    for wavenumber @xmath120 ( bearing in mind that the subscripts @xmath89 and @xmath88 denote the bottom and top fluids respectively ) . given a particular density and shear velocity profile , the interface is unstable if @xmath121 , which occurs for wave numbers between    @xmath122^{1/2}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath123^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    on the other hand , given a particular density profile , the minimum velocity shear needed to destabilise the interface depends on the densities of the fluids and surface tension according to @xcite    @xmath124^{1/2}.\\ ] ]      at first glance , the superfluid dispersion relation ( 24 ) has little in common with the classical dispersion relation ( 28 ) .",
    "however , the underlying physics is similar , as can be seen by considering the special case @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , which resembles a classical , single - fluid kh scenario . in this case",
    ", gravity can not act as a stabilising force , because the densities of the top and bottom fluids are equal .",
    "however , there may easily exist another stabilising force which does not depend on the difference of densities ( in section 3.1.1 , we discuss the possible origin of such a force ) .",
    "thus we replace @xmath129 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "the dispersion relation now simplifies to    @xmath133 @xmath134\\ ] ] @xmath135 @xmath136,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is the entropy ratio . we can simplify this further by investigating the limit where the entropy of the bottom fluid is much greater than that of the top fluid , i.e. @xmath138 . our dispersion relation then becomes    @xmath139(\\omega - ku)^2,\\ ] ]    whose roots can be found from @xmath140 , which represents a stable mode , and from    @xmath141    which represents an unstable mode if    @xmath142<0.\\ ] ]    therefore , the mode becomes unstable when @xmath143 exceeds    @xmath144^{1/4}.\\ ] ]    equation ( 36 ) reduces to the classical result @xmath145 for @xmath146 and is similar in form even for @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the underlying physics of the classical and superfluid kh instabilities are similar , except that , in the latter scenario , the fluids consist of coupled normal and superfluid components , only the normal fluid can transport entropy , and the top and bottom superfluids contain different types of cooper pairs and hence have different entropies even at the same temperature .",
    "the entropy difference shifts the critical density and shear velocity as discussed below and in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "interestingly , we expect @xmath148 under a wide range of physical conditions , yet in this regime ( 32 ) does not factorize simply into ( 33 ) . to recover the classical - like threshold ( 36 )",
    ", one needs @xmath149 , which is uncommon in nature .      in the superfluid kh instability , the entropy ratio @xmath150 shifts the instability threshold . in fig . 1 , we plot the critical ( minimum ) density ratio @xmath151 as @xmath152 changes for three different values of surface tension @xmath153 , 1.1 , and 17.7 , while the top fluid is initially stationary . if @xmath154 , the interface is stable . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the critical ( minimum ) @xmath143 as @xmath152 changes , for @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 . if @xmath158 , the interface is stable .",
    "tables 1 and 2 summarise the parameters used to construct these figures . from figs . 1 and 2",
    ", we see that the shift of the instability threshold away from classical expectations increases as @xmath159 increases .",
    "moreover , as @xmath159 increases , the interface becomes unstable more easily ; interfacial waves are induced for a wider range of @xmath160 , and stability no longer depends solely on density ratio or velocity shear .",
    "classically , the kh instability is driven by a difference in velocity , which causes a difference in pressure between the top and bottom layers of the interface by bernoulli s law . in a superfluid ,",
    "the temperature gradient @xmath161 is also a driving force ( or , more generally , the gradient in chemical potential ) .",
    "thus , a differential shear flow at the interface drives a temperature difference between the layers through ( 3 ) , destabilising the interface .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is related to @xmath162 , since in the momentum equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) the temperature gradient force is proportional to entropy .    in our analysis , we ignore the effects of the container wall .",
    "this is justified in the case of the free @xmath0-@xmath1 interface in a neutron star .",
    "the friction between the fluids and the container wall also lowers the instability threshold , as concluded by @xcite .",
    "in this section , we calculate the wavelength and growth rate of the kh instability for the terrestrial @xcite experiment and neutron star crust - core interface . in both cases",
    ", we also calculate the circulation transferred across the interface , which is proportional to the number of vortex lines per kh wavelength .",
    "the parameters pertaining to the terrestrial experiment @xcite are summarised in table 3 .",
    "the superfluid density is drawn from the table of total fluid densities given by @xcite , assuming normal fluid densities between @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( the superfluid component dominated in the experiment ) .",

    "a , we investigate the instability at the crust - core interface of a typical neutron star , with density and shear velocity profile taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "interestingly , the superfluid interface is stable classically for , say , @xmath200 n m@xmath169 but not when entropic effects are included , when it is unstable for log @xmath201 and log @xmath202 .",
    "classically , the normal fluid is not expected to influence the stability of the superfluid interface ( in this experiment , where the normal fluid interface is absolutely stable , the normal fluid seems naively to act as a passive background ) . yet",
    "our analysis shows that it does affect the stability significantly , indicating that it is driven not only by the shear flow , but also by a ` drag effect ' @xcite between the superfluid and normal fluid components in the b - phase , the strength of which depends on the relative amounts of normal fluid and superfluid present .",
    "this effect comes from the term proportional to @xmath203 in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .    in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the growth rate of the instability [ the maximum of im(@xmath111 ) ] for the three cases above . from fig .",
    "4 , for @xmath148 , we obtain a growth time @xmath204 ms , close to the classical value . this maximum value for im@xmath205",
    "is associated with cutoff wavenumber @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 m@xmath167 for cases 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath209 .",
    "the instability in case 3 , where @xmath198 is highest , grows most quickly , indicating that the superfluid interface is destabilised even further by the normal fluid , through the drag effect .",
    "we anticipate that our prediction of the kh growth time will be tested by future nuclear magnetic resonance measurements .",
    "when the interface becomes unstable , it is hypothesised that superfluid vortex lines break through the interface and transfer circulation from one fluid to the other .",
    "as circulation is quantized , the amount transferred depends on the wavelength of the kh instability , that is , on how many vortex lines @xmath210 can fit within one corrugation of the wave .",
    "a - phase vortex lines are @xmath211 times thicker radially than b - phase ones , so a concentration of energy is needed to push and convert a - phase lines into b - phase lines .",
    "this free energy is provided by the instability at the interface @xcite .",
    "the precise mechanism of vortex transfer and conversion is still unknown , but @xcite suggested that the vortices in the a - phase are pushed by the magnus force towards the vortex - free b - phase , entering the potential well formed by the corrugation of the unstable interface and enhancing the growth of the well until it forms a droplet of a - phase fluid filled with vorticity , which then resides in the b - phase @xcite .    for cases 1 , 2 , and 3 , @xmath193 at @xmath212 is approximately equal to the classical value of @xmath213 m@xmath167 , giving an instability wavelength @xmath214 m. the amount of circulation transferred across the interface is @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "the circulation quantum of superfluid @xmath4he is @xmath216 m@xmath217 s@xmath167 , where @xmath218 is the mass of a @xmath4he atom .",
    "our analysis of the @xcite experiment thus implies @xmath219 m@xmath217 s@xmath167 and @xmath220 .",
    "experimentally , @xcite observed @xmath221 .",
    "the discrepancy may be due , in part , to misestimating of @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and/or @xmath224 in the absence of exact quoted values .",
    "we take heart , however , from semiquantitative agreement between theory and experiment and proceed to apply the theory to the crust - core interface in a neutron star .",
    "we assume that the phase transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 neutron superfluid in a neutron star occurs at a sharp boundary near the crust - core interface at radius @xmath225 km @xcite .",
    "the inner crust consists entirely of neutron bcs pairs in the @xmath0 state , behaving as an isotropic superfluid of density @xmath226 kg m@xmath169 @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the crust is around @xmath227 k , which is about @xmath228 @xcite so the normal fluid is negligible ; we therefore assume from eqs .",
    "( 3.92 ) and ( 3.94 ) in @xcite . however , due to uncertainties in @xmath48 and the fermi - liquid corrections in a neutron superfluid , we obtained @xmath229 at @xmath2300.01 @xmath2 , which seems to be higher than existing phenomenological models can sustain @xcite . thus we take @xmath231 for now . ] @xmath232 kg m@xmath169 and @xmath233 kg m@xmath169 in the absence of detailed knowledge .",
    "the core consists of neutron bcs pairs in the @xmath1 state , with @xmath234 k @xcite .",
    "hence the superfluid component is dominant here also ; we assume @xmath235 kg m@xmath169 and @xmath236 kg m@xmath169 .",
    "this density and shear velocity profile we label as case a , summarised in table 4 .",
    "we also calculate how the instability wave number @xmath193 changes with respect to density ratio @xmath237 with density ratio @xmath152 fixed at 0.1 , 1 , and 10 .",
    "we present these results as cases b , c , and d respectively in table 4 .",
    "note that , in the subsonic regime we investigate , the neutron star matter is approximately incompressible .",
    "the surface tension at the neutron star crust - core interface is unknown .",
    "however , according to @xcite , surface tension scales as @xmath238 , where @xmath48 is the effective mass of the particles and @xmath239 is the fermi momentum . noting that @xmath239 in a neutron superfluid is @xmath240 times higher than terrestrial @xmath4he and @xmath2 is @xmath241 times higher , and terrestrial @xmath4he is measured to have @xmath180 n m@xmath167 @xcite , we estimate that the surface tension of neutron star superfluid is @xmath242 n m@xmath167 , i.e. 25 orders of magnitude higher proportionately .",
    "we are acutely aware of the shortcomings of this estimate and hope that more reliable calculations will be undertaken in the literature in the future .",
    "we plot @xmath243 versus log @xmath152 for case a in fig . 5 , where @xmath244 m@xmath167 is the classical value of the instability threshold , obtained by setting @xmath245 in ( 24 ) .",
    "we see that as @xmath152 increases , the interface becomes less stable .",
    "the instability wave number @xmath193 is inversely proportional to shear velocity @xmath143 and directly proportional to gravitational acceleration @xmath246 , as purely classical kh instability theory predicts @xcite . at low @xmath152 ,",
    "the plot is flat and @xmath193 is fairly close to the classical value ( @xmath247 , 0.666 , and 0.167 m@xmath167 for @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 m s@xmath167 respectively ) .",
    "case a is classically unstable , but the shift in @xmath193 is only noticeable at higher @xmath152 , where the plot dips at log @xmath251 . note that we find @xmath252 , so the assumption of a plane wave perturbation is justified _ a posteriori_.    one can also vary the density ratio @xmath5 while keeping @xmath152 constant . in fig .",
    "6 , we plot @xmath193 against @xmath5 for three different entropy ratios @xmath170 , 1 , and 10 , labelled as cases b , c , and d respectively ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the classical minimum wave number approaches infinity as the top fluid density reaches zero , i.e. the interface becomes absolutely stable as the top fluid disappears .",
    "when entropy is taken into account , @xmath193 still increases as @xmath5 gets lower , but at a slower rate , especially at higher @xmath152 .",
    "cases b , c , and d join the classical curve at @xmath253 , 0.9 , and 1.0 , demonstrating again that we diverge further from the classical expectation as @xmath159 increases .    in the foregoing",
    ", we do not consider the effects of a magnetic field and susceptibility discontinuity at the interface . in principle",
    ", a magnetic field can stabilise the boundary as in the blaauwgeers experiment ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "we can set an approximate upper bound on @xmath254 at @xmath255 , where @xmath88 is the magnetic field at the surface of the star ( typically @xmath256 t ) .",
    "thus , the upper bound on the magnetic force density is between @xmath257 and @xmath258 n m@xmath169 .",
    "however , we find that , for case a ( i.e. typical neutron star parameters ) , the minimum magnetic force density necessary to stabilise the interface occupies the range @xmath259@xmath260 n m@xmath169 for @xmath261 , much higher than the maximum force density available .    for a given shear velocity and density profile , one can now estimate the growth rate @xmath262 of the instability .",
    "we present our plot of growth rate versus @xmath152 for a standard neutron star density profile ( case a ) as fig . 7 ; the classical growth rate is im@xmath263 s@xmath167 for these parameters .",
    "the growth rate is found to be directly proportional to the cube of the shear velocity and inversely proportional to surface tension .",
    "we find @xmath264 for @xmath265 .",
    "the growth time grows monotonically with @xmath160 and takes the value of @xmath266 s at @xmath267 m@xmath167 ( where @xmath268 is determined by the surface tension ) .",
    "if there is no surface tension , the viscosity of the fluid suppresses the kh instability when the viscous time - scale is shorter that the growth time of the kh oscillation , i.e. for @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the viscosity of superfluid neutron star matter is estimated to lie between 0.1 and 0.17 m@xmath217 s@xmath167 for case a @xcite . in fig .",
    "8 , we present a plot of im@xmath205 versus @xmath152 .",
    "we find im@xmath271 . for case a , if the surface tension vanishes but viscosity suppresses the instability , we estimate im@xmath272 and @xmath273 m@xmath167 for @xmath274 , translating into a growth time of @xmath275 s. the growth time is @xmath211 times larger than the limit imposed by surface tension above , indicating that viscosity suppresses the instability more effectively than surface tension .    _",
    "prima facie _ , our kh growth time estimate seems too small ; certainly , it is unresolvable by radio pulsar timing .",
    "however , it is highly dependent on @xmath276 ( @xmath277 , unlike in the terrestrial experiment ) .",
    "as @xmath268 depends on dissipation physics which is largely neglected in our model , e.g. textural terms on the right - hand sides of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , a more complete analysis is needed before the kh growth time can be predicted with confidence .      for typical neutron star parameters ( case a ) , near @xmath274 , we obtain @xmath278 m@xmath167 , and hence @xmath279 m. this implies that the amount of circulation transferred across the interface is @xmath280 m@xmath217 s@xmath167 . the total circulation at the interface is roughly @xmath281 m@xmath217 s@xmath167 .",
    "therefore , the fractional change in angular velocity is @xmath282 .",
    "this compares surprisingly well with observations of the angular velocity jump in pulsar glitches , viz .",
    "@xmath283 @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic models of neutron star superfluids in the literature @xcite often include protons , electrons , and muons .",
    "the latter two species can be effectively incorporated into the normal fluid in our analysis @xcite , but the protons can not .",
    "how significant is the proton superfluid ?",
    "one key effect of the protons is the drag they exert on the neutrons .",
    "the strength of the ` drag effect ' between the protons and neutrons is set by the off - diagonal elements of the symmetrical mass density matrix , i.e. @xmath284 , where @xmath198 ( @xmath285 ) , @xmath286 ( @xmath287 ) , and @xmath288 ( @xmath289 ) are the neutron ( proton ) density , bare mass , and effective mass respectively",
    ". estimates of @xmath289 vary between @xmath290 and @xmath291 , while @xmath285 can be estimated from neutron star cooling rates @xcite .",
    "if we take the proton density to be 15 per cent of the total core density of @xmath292 kg m@xmath169 , the threshold proton fraction for direct urca cooling @xcite , we obtain @xmath293 .",
    "hence the proton - neutron drag force in eq .",
    "( 14 ) of @xcite , as a fraction of a typical term in our momentum equation ( 1 ) , is given by @xmath294 ( for a typical kh instability , the phase velocity is of the same order as the shear velocity ) , where @xmath295 ( @xmath296 ) is the neutron ( proton ) superfluid velocity . in other words ,",
    "the proton - neutron drag is smaller than , but comparable to , the forces we consider and should be included in general .",
    "it is omitted in this paper to keep the algebra manageable and to maintain focus on the entropic kh effects , presented here for the first time .",
    "note that , although the normal fluid fraction under neutron star conditions may be low , the entropy ratio @xmath152 is what matters in our analysis , and it is not negligible .",
    "there are other physical effects that also appear when charged species are included . in this paper",
    ", we intentionally neglect electromagnetic forces [ see eqs . ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in @xcite ] and electromagnetic contributions to the chemical potential [ eqs .",
    "( 29 ) and ( 30 ) in @xcite ] , again to render the superfluid kh analysis tractable .",
    "one electromagnetic effect is included : the force term @xmath223 , which can stabilise the interface in principle ( see section 3.1.1 above ) , although in practice it is too weak to shift @xmath193 appreciably in a neutron star ( see section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "apart from excluding the proton superfluid , our hydrodynamic equations are similar to those written down by @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the coupling is between the normal fluid and superfluid components and is governed by entropy ( this coupling has been unambiguously observed in laboratory experiments , e.g. second sound in he ii ) .",
    "our terms involving entropy and counterflow are derived from the gradient of the chemical potential ( see section 2.1 ) and therefore are implicitly included in the neutron superfluid chemical potential @xmath297 [ eq .",
    "( 29 ) in @xcite ] .",
    "another important difference is that @xcite and @xcite deal with a non - stratified neutron star which consists of two different but interpenetrating superfluids , whereas we deal with a stratified ( two - zone ) neutron star with two layers of superfluid in differential rotation .",
    "we analyse the superfluid kh instability within the framework of two - fluid hydrodynamics including entropy flow and both the superfluid and normal fluid components in each fluid .",
    "we find that the coupling between the superfluid and the normal fluid components via entropy transport lowers the instability threshold ( especially when the entropy ratio is large ) even if there is no significant counterflow .",
    "when the counterflow is significant , as in the experiment conducted by @xcite , the reduction in the threshold is even greater .",
    "classically , the kh instability occurs because the velocity shear induces a self - reinforcing pressure gradient across the interface . in a superfluid ,",
    "the ( perturbed ) temperature gradient , driven by the differential flow , is also a driving force , the magnitude of which is controlled by ratio of the entropies of the fluids , and the interface becomes less stable than expected classically .",
    "when the interface crinkles , it is believed that superfluid vortex lines break through and transfer circulation between the fluids , although the mechanism is not understood at the gross - pitaevskii level .",
    "since circulation is quantized , the amount transferred depends on how many vortex lines can fit in one corrugation of the kh surface wave",
    ". applied to @xcite experiment , our model yields a growth time of @xmath204 ms and threshold wavenumber @xmath298 m@xmath167 , so that the number of vortex lines transferred is @xmath299 .",
    "the observed number of vortex lines is 10 @xcite .",
    "applied to the neutron star crust - core ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) interface , with @xmath300 m sec@xmath167 and @xmath274 , we find @xmath301 m , so that the fractional change in angular velocity is @xmath302 .",
    "this compares favourably with typical pulsar glitch events , which are observed to have @xmath303 @xcite . in view of this estimate , and the high kh growth rate , it is possible that vortex line transfer through a surface kh instability may explain pulsar glitches .",
    "an alternative process , the two - stream instability of isotropic neutron and proton superfluids in differential rotation , is also an attractive possibility @xcite .",
    "a more thorough analysis of both , taking into account the nonuniform texture and anisotropic densities and thermal conductivities of the core superfluid , is worth pursuing .",
