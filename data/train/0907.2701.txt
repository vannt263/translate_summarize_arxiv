    "in  @xcite batyrev obtained combinatorial formulas for hodge numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 of an @xmath2-dimensional calabi - yau variety @xmath3 arising as a hypersurface in a toric variety associated to a reflexive polytope .",
    "it is immediate from these formulas that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is batyrev s mirror of @xmath3 , and this equality suffices to show that mirror symmetry holds on the level of hodge numbers for calabi - yau 3-folds .",
    "however , it is also important to consider higher dimensional calabi - yau varieties including singular ones .",
    "batyrev and dais , motivated by `` physicists hodge numbers '' , introduced _ string - theoretic hodge numbers _",
    "@xcite for a certain class of singular varieties .",
    "the string - theoretic hodge numbers coincide with the regular ones for smooth varieties and with regular hodge numbers of a crepant desingularization if it exists .",
    "later batyrev also introduced _",
    "stringy hodge numbers _",
    "@xcite for a different class of singular varieties .",
    "while stringy and string - theoretic hodge numbers are not the same , they do agree for the varieties we will be dealing with in this paper , see  @xcite for further details on relations between them .",
    "batyrev and borisov were able to obtain a formula for the generating function of string - theoretic hodge numbers in the case of complete intersections in toric varieties and show that this function has properties corresponding to mirror symmetry  @xcite . while their formula can be used in practice for computing hodge numbers ( as it is done in software palp  @xcite ) ,",
    "it is recursive , takes significant time even on computers , and does not provide much qualitative information on particular hodge numbers .",
    "this work was motivated by the desire to obtain , for complete intersections , formulas similar to those for hypersurfaces .",
    "we were able to accomplish this goal in the case of two hypersurfaces intersecting in a five dimensional toric variety , see theorem  [ thm : h11cigeneric ] for arbitrary nef partitions and a simplified expression in theorem  [ thm : h11cispecial ] for the indecomposable ones .",
    "the algorithm allows one to get expressions for @xmath6 for the intersection of two hypersurfaces in a higher dimensional ambient space as well .",
