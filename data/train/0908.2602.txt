    "@xcite suggested that magnetic fluctuations in a shock precursor may be amplified by a fast , nonresonant instability induced by the strong diffusive electric current of the shock - accelerated crs .",
    "the transverse mhd waves produced by this mechanism have wavelengths much shorter than the wave generating cr gyroradii .",
    "in efficient dsa , the cr current driving the instability must be strongly coupled to the turbulent magnetic fields and supersonic mhd flow . to address this issue , we simulated the amplification of bell s modes as part of a nonlinear monte carlo ( mc ) model of dsa @xcite .",
    "we self - consistently  model four basic strongly coupled components of the system : the bulk plasma flow , the full particle spectrum , the self - generated mhd turbulence including cascading , and thermal particle injection .",
    "the efficiently produced crs modify the upstream flow speed , and the cr current determines the growth of stochastic magnetic fields .",
    "the fields , in turn , set the particle diffusive transport properties and , subsequently , the injection and acceleration efficiency of the particles , closing the system .",

    "consider the nonlinear precursor of a strong , plane - parallel , steady - state shock . in the reference frame co - moving with the subshock ( at @xmath1 ) , where the plasma flows in the positive @xmath2-direction , the flow speed @xmath3 has the value @xmath4 far upstream .",
    "the speed , @xmath3 , drops in the precursor until it obtains the downstream speed @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the overall shock compression ratio .",

    "such a description , i.e. , the kolmogorov cascade model , has been successful in explaining the spectra of locally isotropic , incompressible turbulence in non - conducting fluids , observed in experiments and simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is uncertain how spectral transfer operates in a collisionless shock precursor with a cr current strong enough to modify the mhd modes , and in the presence of strong magnetic turbulence . in weak mhd turbulence , cascading was shown to be anisotropic @xcite : harmonics with wavenumbers transverse to the mean magnetic field experience a kolmogorov - like cascade , while the cascade in wavenumbers parallel to the mean field is suppressed .",
    "@xcite argue for an inverse cascade ( i.e. , from short to long wavelengths ) of turbulent harmonics in the context of magnetic field amplification in dsa .",

    "mhd modeling of bell s instability with fixed cr current , performed by @xcite and @xcite , show that the magnetic structures consist of expanding walls of strong magnetic field spiraling around cavities in density and magnetic field .",
    "moreover , @xcite revealed that the turbulent energy is non - linearly transferred to both longer and shorter scales ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "it should be noted however , that the mhd models ignored both the interaction of cr particles with the instability - generated turbulence , and the feedback of the turbulence on the cr current that are the main subjects of our study .",

    "the peaks are a direct result of bell s nonresonant  instability , but they will not show up unless @xmath92 and @xmath24 are calculated consistently , and the simulation has a large enough dynamic range in both @xmath8 and @xmath43 .    as emphasized above , cascading in strong turbulence is uncertain and our two models bound the extremes of no cascading and kolmogorov  cascading to larger @xmath8 .",
    "our results are also limited by the fact that we havent considered the case of energy transfer from short to long scales .",
    "nevertheless , the stark differences we see in both the shock structure and the turbulence spectrum suggest that observations may be able to constrain cascading models . the stratification is eliminated and the peaks are spread out if rapid kolmogorov cascading is assumed .",

    "if cascading to short scales is important , magnetic energy is efficiently transfered to the background gas and the amplified magnetic field is considerably reduced .",

    "[ fig_ubj ] , the precursor temperature can be orders of magnitude greater with cascading than without .",
    "the low - energy superthermal particles ( up to @xmath129 ) are more abundant in the presence of cascading and dissipation ( top panel of figure  [ fig_fl ] ) due to heating - boosted injection @xcite , which may influence bremsstrahlung and spectral line emission in snrs ."
