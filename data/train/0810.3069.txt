    "radiative @xmath0 decay proceeds through a penguin loop diagram in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "new particles beyond the sm may contribute in the loop diagrams . in this paper , we present recent belle results on various radiative @xmath0 decay topics below .",
    "inclusive @xmath4 measurements will constrain new physics from the branching fraction as well as determining @xmath10-quark mass and motion from photon energy spectrum .",
    "time dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath4 transition can probe for right - handed coupling which is not present in sm .",
    "measurements of exclusive mode @xmath11 and @xmath12 can probe deviations from sm by the branching fraction and @xmath9 asymmetry .",
    "in all these studies , large continuum background from @xmath13 events ( @xmath14 ) has been suppressed using event topology variables . in exclusive modes , two kinematic variable @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are commonly used . here",
    "@xmath17 is the beam energy and @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the energy and momentum of a @xmath0 candidate , all defined in the @xmath2 frame .",
    "in this fully inclusive method , @xmath4 decay is studied using a @xmath20 on data sample taken at the @xmath2 resonance , and @xmath21 off data sample taken at an energy @xmath22 below the resonance .",
    "hard photon is selected from well isolated ecl clusters with the shower shape consistent with a photon , and required to have a center - of - mass energy @xmath23 gev . @xmath24 and @xmath25 vetoes are then applied .",
    "first , the photon energy spectrum measured in off data is scaled by luminosity to the expected number of non-@xmath26 events in on data and subtracted , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdata](a ) . here",
    "the off spectrum has been corrected due to the slight lower energy than on events",
    ". then the backgrounds coming from non - primary photons from @xmath0 mesons subtracted from the obtained spectrum . from monte carlo ( mc ) study , six background categories are considered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bdata](b ) ) : ( i ) photons from @xmath27 ; ( ii ) photons from @xmath28 ; ( iii ) other real photons ; ( iv ) ecl clusters not due to single photons ( mainly @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s ) ; ( v ) electrons misidentified as photons ; and ( vi ) beam background . for each of the background category",
    ", the shape and yield is corrected from mc using data by selecting them .",
    "then , for each selection criterion used in this analysis , the data - mc efficiency ratio is obtained using appropriate control samples , and is then used to scale the mc background sample . for example",
    ", the @xmath24 veto efficiency is studied using @xmath31 decays where only one @xmath32 from @xmath24 is reconstructed .    the raw spectrum shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bdata](c ) is obtained after subtracting the six background categories after scaling . the raw spectrum",
    "is then corrected by three step procedure : ( i ) divide by the efficiency of the selection ; ( ii ) perform an unfolding which removes the distortion by caused ecl ; ( iii ) divide by efficiency of detection .",
    "then , two additional corrections are applied : ( i ) to remove cabibbo suppressed @xmath33 decays , using the ratio of branching fractions ; ( ii ) to correct the measurements to @xmath0-meson rest frame from @xmath2 frame ( boost correction ) .",
    "the partial branching fraction , first moment ( mean ) and second central moment ( variance ) of the photon energy spectrum from @xmath0 decay are obtained as :  @xcite @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 , where the errors are statistical , systematic and from the boost correction , respectively .",
