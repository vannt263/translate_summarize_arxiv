    "the study of strongly interacting quantum models by direct realization of an experimental system reproducing the model properties , an idea proposed by feynman @xcite , was realized in the past ten years with the production of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) and their use as  quantum simulators \" @xcite . in particular , bec in conjunction with optical lattices are used to produce systems reproducing the physics of well known quantum statistical discrete models such as fermionic or bosonic hubbard models .    used to study simple models of bosons @xcite or fermions @xcite at low temperature , the flexibility offered by these systems extends the range of interesting models to more exotic ones which can be treated both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "examples include systems with long range interactions @xcite , fermions with imbalanced populations @xcite , mixtures of different kinds of particles @xcite and spin-1 bosons with spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions which allow interplay between superfluidity and magnetism @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to study systems of bosons with two effective internal degrees of freedom on an optical lattice , the so - called  spin-@xmath0 bosons \" .",
    "such a system , with spin - dependent interactions , could be produced by applying a periodic optical lattice on a bosonic system with two triply degenerate internal energy levels .",
    "the optical potential applied would localise the atoms at the nodes of a regular network , but would also couple the internal states by @xmath1 or v virtual processes , thus leaving only two internal low energy degenerated states denoted @xmath2 and @xmath1 and realizing an effective spin-@xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "the presence of the spin - dependent interaction introduces a term in the hamiltonian which permits the conversion of two particles of one type into the other type and renders numerical simulations more difficult .",
    "this model is related , but not identical , to other models including p - band superfluid models @xcite and the bosonic kondo model @xcite .",
    "understanding the phase diagram and properties of the simpler spin-@xmath0 bosonic system takes us a step toward understanding the more elaborate , and more difficult to simulate , models .",
    "the spin-@xmath0 model has been extensively studied with mean - field theory ( mft ) at zero or finite temperatures and , in previous work , we explored its zero temperature behavior with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations in one @xcite and two @xcite dimensions for on - site repulsive interactions . at zero temperature ,",
    "the phase diagrams obtained in one and two dimensions , with mft or qmc , are similar .",
    "generally speaking , at zero temperature , the system can adopt two different kinds of phases : insulating mott phases that appear for integer density , @xmath3 , and for large enough repulsion between particles and superfluid phases ( sf ) otherwise .",
    "the detailed nature of these phases depends on the interactions between the different kinds of particles . in the case where the repulsion between identical particles is smaller than between different particles ( @xmath4 in our previous work @xcite and in the following )",
    "the superfluid is found to be polarized , that is , an imbalance develops in the populations of the two kinds of particles and one of the species becomes dominant .",
    "the @xmath5 mott phase is also polarized whereas the @xmath6 phase is not ( we did not study higher densities with qmc ) . in the opposite case , @xmath7 , all the phases are unpolarized .",
    "noteworthy is the presence of coherent exchange movements @xcite , where two particles of different types exchange their position in the @xmath5 mott phase in both cases , as well as in the @xmath6 mott phase for @xmath8 .",
    "finally , in one dimension , all zero temperature phase transitions were found to be continuous whereas in two dimensions and when @xmath9 is small enough , the @xmath6 mott - superfluid transition was predicted by mft to be first order near the tip of the mott lobe and continuous otherwise , whereas for larger @xmath10 the transition was predicted to be always continuous .",
    "this was confirmed by qmc simulations @xcite .",
    "related spin-1 models were studied using mft @xcite or qmc in one dimension @xcite and a similar spin 1/2 bosons model was also recently studied @xcite .    in this paper , we will study the spin-@xmath0 model at finite temperature in two dimensions and compare with mft predictions .",
    "the results for finite system sizes and temperatures are relevant to experimental efforts to study this system . in section",
    "ii , we will introduce the model and the mft and qmc techniques used to study it .",
    "section iii and iv will be devoted to the presentation of the results obtained for the @xmath9 and @xmath11 cases , respectively .",
    "we will summarize these results and give some final remarks in section iv .",
    "the model we will study is the same we previously studied in the low temperature limit in one @xcite and two dimensions @xcite and previously introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is an extended hubbard model governed by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where operator @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) destroys ( creates ) a boson of type @xmath15 on site @xmath16 of a two - dimensional square lattice of size @xmath17 .",
    "the operators @xmath18 measures the number of particles of type @xmath19 on site @xmath20 .",
    "the densities of particles of type 0 and @xmath1 are called @xmath21 and @xmath22 while the total density is called @xmath23 .",
    "the first term ( [ h1 ] ) of the hamiltonian is the kinetic term that lets particles hop from site @xmath20 to its nearest neighbours @xmath24 .",
    "the associated hopping energy @xmath25 sets the energy scale .",
    "a chemical potential @xmath26 is added if one works in the grand canonical ensemble . the second term ( [ h2 ] )",
    "describes on - site repulsion between identical particles with a strength @xmath27 or between different particles with a strength @xmath28 .",
    "we will study both the positive and negative @xmath10 cases but will keep only repulsive interactions , that is @xmath29 , and a fixed moderate value of @xmath30 . the last term ( [ h3 ] ) provides a possibility to change the  spins \" of the particles : when two identical particles are on the same site , they can be transformed into two particles of the other type .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the matrix element associated with this conversion is @xmath31 .",
    "we are using a different sign for the term ( [ h3 ] ) compared to the articles where the model was originally introduced @xcite but we have shown in a previous work @xcite that this sign can indeed be chosen freely due to a symmetry of the model .",
    "the only term that couples different sites in the hamiltonian is the hopping term ( [ h1 ] ) . introducing the field @xmath32",
    ", we replace the creation / destruction operators on site @xmath33 by their mean values @xmath34 , following the approach used in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian on site @xmath20 is then decoupled from neighboring sites and can be easily diagonalized numerically in a finite basis .",
    "the optimal value of the fields @xmath34 are then chosen by minimizing the grand canonical potential @xmath35 with respect to @xmath34 where @xmath36 is the grand canonical partition function .",
    "the system is in a superfluid phase when @xmath34 is nonzero , with superfluid density @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total number of particles on site @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath39 is close to zero in the mott phase and much larger in the liquid phase .    while this mft was shown to reproduce qualitatively the phase diagram at zero temperature @xcite , it is rather limited at finite temperature",
    "indeed , whenever the @xmath34 are zero the hopping parameter @xmath40 no longer plays a rle in the mft . then , while the mft can distinguish between sf and unordered phases , it does not correctly distinguish mott insulator ( mi ) regions from normal bose liquids ones , as the crossover boundary between those regions will not depend on @xmath40 and will be the same as in the @xmath41 case .      to simulate this system , we used the stochastic green function algorithm ( sgf ) @xcite , an exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique that allows canonical or grand canonical simulations of the system at finite temperatures as well as measurements of many - particle green functions .",
    "in particular , this algorithm can simulate efficiently the spin - flip term in the hamiltonian .",
    "we studied sizes up to @xmath42 .",
    "the density @xmath3 is conserved in canonical simulations , but individual densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 fluctuate due to the conversion term eq .",
    "( [ h3 ] ) .",
    "the superfluid density is given by fluctuations of the total winding number , @xmath43 , of the world lines of the particles @xcite @xmath44 the superfluid density can not be measured separately for @xmath2 and @xmath1 particles due to the conversion term @xcite .",
    "it , therefore depends on the total density not on the separate densities of the two species .",
    "we also calculate the one particle green functions @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 measures the phase coherence of individual particles .    in a strongly correlated system",
    "it is useful to study correlated movements of particles which can be done , for example , by studying two - particle green functions .",
    "we found @xcite that anticorrelated movements of particles govern the dynamics of particles inside mott lobes , as the particles of different types exchange their positions .",
    "the two - particles anti - correlated green function @xmath48 measures the phase coherence of such exchange movements as a function of distance .",
    "due to its definition , @xmath49 can not be larger that @xmath50 and is equal to @xmath51 if there is no correlation between the movements of 0 and @xmath1 particles .    in two dimensions , at low but finite temperatures , we expect , in some cases , to observe a berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition and the different green functions to adopt a power law behavior at large distance @xmath52 , @xmath53 , characteristic of the appearance of a quasi long range order ( qlro ) in the phase , long range order ( lro ) being achieved only at @xmath54 ( @xmath55 varying between 1/4 and 0 as @xmath56 is lowered ) @xcite . in other words , at finite @xmath56 we can expect a superfluid where the phase is stiff but not ordered and not a bec whith an ordered phase .",
    "at high temperature , the green functions are of course expected to decay exponentially . on the finite size systems which we study ( @xmath57 ) , it is difficult to distinguish the qlro from a true lro , whereas one can easily distinguish between the qlro and exponentially decreasing regimes .",
    "this difficulty of distinguishing qlro from lro is also encountered in experiments where the sizes of systems that can be studied are typically of the same order as in our qmc simulations ( hundreds of particles ) .",
    "the finite size results are , therefore , directly relevant to experiments .    to elucidate the properties the model ,",
    "we formulate it in terms of spins using a schwinger bosons approach @xcite .",

    "favors pseudo - spin correlations to develop along the @xmath63 axis if @xmath7 or in the @xmath64 plane for @xmath65 .",
    "we note that the total spin @xmath66 on a given site is not fixed but depends on the total number of particles on the site ( @xmath67 ) and will then fluctuate with this number .",
    "an order along @xmath68 is measured through the densities or through density - density correlations of 0 or @xmath1 particles , _",
    "i.e. _ it corresponds to the polarization of the system .",
    "an order along the @xmath63 or @xmath69 axes is exposed through the behavior of @xmath49 which , in terms of spins , is equal to @xmath70 .",
    "our qmc algorithm allows the calculation of @xmath71 but does not give access to correlations along the @xmath63 and @xmath69 axes independently .",
    "we remark that the @xmath69 and @xmath68 axis have the same behavior , which means that we expect a spin qlro in the @xmath64 plane to appear at low enough temperature for @xmath65 in addition to the expected qlro of the global phase of the particles discussed earlier . on our finite size systems",
    ", this means that we should simultaneously observe a polarization and a qlro for @xmath49 .",
    "we will call such a phenomenon a  quasi - polarization \" ( qp ) . for @xmath65 and finite @xmath56",
    ", we expect a qlro to develop along the @xmath63 axis and , consequently , no polarization but still a plateau at long distances in the function @xmath49 .",
    "at zero temperature , the results obtained with qmc and mft were in good qualitative agreement @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram , studied for densities up to two , exhibits three phases .",
    "the first two phases are incompressible mott phases obtained for integer densities @xmath5 and @xmath6 for large enough interactions @xmath27 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the entire @xmath5 mott phase is polarized , that is the system sustains a spontaneous symmetry breaking and the density of one type of particles becomes dominant .",
    "this polarization can be understood in the framework of an effective spin-1/2 model @xcite as the coupling in the @xmath64 plane is stronger than along the @xmath63 axis .",
    "as expected , exchange movements of particles coexist with polarization in this phase and @xmath49 develop a long range phase coherence .",
    "the @xmath6 mott phase is unpolarized and show no sign of exchange moves . in terms of spin , this corresponds to the fact that , neglecting the kinetic term , the ground state for a given site is uniquely determined as the state with @xmath73 .",
    "the third possible phase is a polarized superfluid ( sf ) and occurs at any @xmath27 when the density is incommensurate and also at small @xmath27 for commensurate values .",
    "it is not possible to discuss this phase in terms of a simple effective spin degree of freedom as the number of particles on a site is not fixed .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the transition from the @xmath5 mott phase to the sf is continuous , whereas at the tip of the @xmath6 mott lobe , the transition to the sf is first order for small values of @xmath74 becoming second order for larger values .",
    "this was predicted by the mft @xcite and confirmed by qmc simulations @xcite .       and @xmath6 mott regions ( mi ) for different values of the temperature @xmath76 and for different sizes @xmath77 . as the temperature increases ,",
    "the mott lobes shrink and totally disappear for @xmath78 . outside the mott , the system crosses over to a normal bose liquid ( nbl ) and , eventually , transitions to a quasi - polarized superfluid ( qp - sf ) phase ( see below ) . in the limit of zero temperature",

    "iia , although the compressibility of these regions is very small , they are not strictly incompressible due to thermal fluctuations . the evolution from mi to nbl",
    "does not show any singularity and is then simply a crossover between two different limiting behaviors , incompressible and compressible , of the same unordered phase . strictly speaking",
    ", a truly incompressible mott phase exists only at @xmath54 but , following convention , we will continue to refer to this finite @xmath56 region as a mi . to define",
    "the crossover boundary between the mi and the nbl shown in phase diagrams , we use the following criterion : when the density deviates by 1% from the total integer density we consider that the system is no longer in the mi region but in the nbl region .    figure [ mottlimits ] shows the limits of the mi regions for different temperatures .",
    "as expected , the mi regions progressively disappear as the temperature is increased .",
    "the limits of the superfluid phase are located by direct measurement of @xmath81 .",
    "when the system is compressible and has zero superfluid density , there is a normal bose liquid .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ( top ) shows the qmc phase diagram of the system at a constant finite temperature .",
    "as the sf and mi regions are destroyed due to thermal fluctuations , an intermediate nbl region appears .",
    "the mft used with success at @xmath54 , where it reproduces qualitatively the phase diagram , is unable to do so at finite temperature as explained in sec .",
    "figure  [ phasediagram ] ( bottom ) shows the mft phase diagram where the afore mentioned problem clearly appears : the boundaries between the mi and nbl do not depend on the value of @xmath82 and the mft is unable to give correct predictions regarding this crossover .",

    "as will be shown below , for finite temperatures , this is in total contradiction with the results obtained by qmc simulations that show continuous phase transitions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "so this mft provides incorrect description of the phase transition and of the position of the different regions at finite temperature .    for fixed integer density at zero temperature",

    "as expected @xcite , when the temperature is increased from zero , an intermediate compressible unordered region appears between the superfluid phase and the mott region , namely the normal bose liquid region ( nbl ) .",

    "the finite @xmath56 superfluid phase does not have bec in this two - dimensional system .",
    "the system is quasi - polarized throughout the superfluid phase , but it is not in the nbl and mi .",
    "the mott phase is polarized at @xmath54 and should be quasi - polarized at extremely small @xmath56 .",

    "the sf - nbl transition is continuous , whereas at @xmath54 the mi - sf quantum phase transition was found to be discontinuous for @xmath74 small enough @xcite .",

    "[ histo].,width=321 ]    as for the possible polarization of the different phases , we observe that the sf phase appears to be polarized at finite @xmath56 as it is at @xmath54 : the histogram of the density of one of the species shows two peaks at low and high densities ( see fig . [ histo ] ) .",
    "however , due to the continuous symmetry in the @xmath64 plane of the pseudo - spin part of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hspart2 ] ) , no lro exists at finite @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , this apparent polarization is due to the finite size of the system , and is , in fact , a quasi - polarization . an intuitive way to understand this",
    "quasi - polarization is as follows : in the superfluid phase , the pseudo - spins in the @xmath64 plane are stiff and appear to be mostly aligned in the same direction on a finite lattice , such as the case here .",
    "but since the symmetry is not broken , this `` magnetization '' direction in the @xmath64 plane will drift and point in all directions . as the direction changes , so does the projection of this pseudo - spin on the @xmath68-axis .",

    "the system is in the unordered unpolarized phase .",
    "the temperature at which the quasi - polarization disappears is approximately the same as the temperature where @xmath81 becomes zero ( see the vertical dashed line in fig .  [ afrho2 ] ) .",
    "only the sf phase is quasi - polarized.[histo],width=321 ]    a histogram of the polarization in the @xmath5 mi region shows that as soon as the temperature is increased from zero , the polarization disappears and the populations become balanced .",
    "according to the effective pseudo - spin model @xcite , it is possible to observe quasi - polarization as in the sf phase . in this case , the coupling generating these spin correlations and the polarization of the mi is of order @xmath89 .",

    "the mi regions are drastically modified as the polarization that occurs in certain cases is almost immediately wiped out by thermal fluctuations : low temperature quasi polarized states are not found in the regime of temperatures we studied .",
    "this is due to the fact that the energy scales associated with the polarization of the system take different values in these different phases . in the mi regions ,",
    "the polarization is due to the coupling between different low energy degenerate mott states , as emphasized by the pseudo - spin theory @xcite .",
    "these couplings are of order @xmath89 and the pseudo - spin quasi - ordering vanishes very rapidly with temperature . on the other hand , in the superfluid",
    ", the energy scale associated with the coupling of pseudo - spins is obviously much larger .",
    "while it is not possible to specify this scale as precisely as in the mott phases , due to the itinerant nature of the particles in the superfluid regime , a simple argument shows that it is of order @xmath10 : whenever the particles enter the superfluid phase and adopt delocalized states , they overlap ; there is an interaction cost which is then of order @xmath27 for identical particles and @xmath28 for different ones .",
    "this favors having the particles mostly of the same type for @xmath65 and leads to a quasi polarization . for @xmath7",
    ", the interaction favors having a mixture of particles and gives a system without any sign of polarization . in both cases , the energy scale is typically @xmath117    the finite temperature phase diagram presented here is important for the proper interpretation of experimental realization of this and related systems using ultra - cold atoms loaded on optical lattices .",
    "such experiments are , of course , always at finite temperature . similarly to what happens for fermions , we observe that the spin correlations in the mott phases will be very difficult to access experimentally as the associated energy scales are very small and as the correlations are almost immediately wiped out by thermal fluctuations . on the other hand , due to the relatively small sizes of experimental systems and to its larger associated energies , the quasi - ordering of spins in the superfluid phase should be immediately visible experimentally and indistinguishable from true polarization of the system . in a finite size system , one would expect to observe a slow drift of the polarization as the @xmath64 symmetry of the system is restored over time .    from a more technical point of view , we have elucidated the limitations of the mft commonly used in the literature .",
    "we found that it is unable to distinguish correctly the mi and nbl regions .",
    "the mft does predict reasonably well the nbl - sf boundaries but not the nature of the transition which is sometimes predicted to be of first order whereas direct qmc simulations , and symmetry considerations , show that it is in the bkt universality class .",
    "furthermore , we found that mft predicts direct first and second order transitions at finite @xmath56 between the mi and sf phases which qmc shows do not exist , ( see figs .",
    "[ afrho1 ] , [ afrho2 ] , [ rho12_u2neg ] ) .",
    "similar incorrect mft behavior was found for the spin-@xmath118 model and the same caveats should be applied for example in ref.@xcite .",
