    "the last decade has witnessed the identification and elaboration of an important population of hot o- and b - type stars hosting strong , organized magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational and theoretical studies of the interaction of their intense radiation - driven winds with their magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that the stellar wind properties of magnetic hot stars are modified in important ways as compared to the winds of non - magnetic stars , introducing significant changes across the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the presence of an organized magnetic field at the surface of a hot star leads to channelling and confinement of its outflowing stellar wind , creating a magnetosphere , which can radiate in various wavebands @xcite .    in regions close to the star , the magnetic pressure dominates and causes the wind to follow dipolar field lines . at greater distances from the stellar surface , the wind kinetic energy density exceeds the magnetic pressure due to the stronger radial decline of magnetic field energy density than of wind kinetic energy density .",
    "the radius at which the wind kinetic energy density becomes equal to the magnetic pressure is defined as the alfvn radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the region below the alfvn radius , i.e. interior to the largest closed magnetic loop , is defined as the inner magnetosphere @xcite , which is the site of generation of x - ray and h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . beyond the alfvn radius ,",
    "the wind opens the magnetic field lines , generating a current sheet in the magnetic equatorial plane .",
    "this region is defined as the middle magnetosphere . at greater distances from the star",
    ", the outer magnetospheric region is characterized by a radial magnetic topology following wind streamlines .",
    "radio emission from non - magnetic hot stars is expected to be thermal free - free emission from the ionized wind in the circumstellar environment @xcite . however , in the presence of magnetic fields electrons can be accelerated to relativistic energies , either by reconnection near the current sheet in the middle magnetosphere @xcite or generated in strong , large - scale shocks in the inner magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "these energetic electrons can give rise to gyrosynchrotron radio emission @xcite .",
    "various surveys of cooler magnetic a- and b - type stars have been carried out at 58 ghz radio frequencies , resulting in @xmath1 detections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite interpreted the radio emission in these stars as gyrosynchrotron in nature , arising from regions located at @xmath2 , with higher frequency emission originating from plasma located closer to the star , and the lower frequency emission from material further away .",
    "@xcite monitored the 5 ghz radio emission of two magnetic b - type stars , hd 37017 and @xmath3 ori e , and observed variability in accordance with their respective rotational periods .",
    "the coincidence of radio maxima with the extrema of the longitudinal magnetic field in these stars led those authors to suggest that radio emitting regions are located above the magnetic poles .",
    "radio variability was also measured from the magnetic b8p star hd 133880 ( hr lup ) .",
    "the flux density and circular polarization were observed to vary according to the stellar rotation period @xcite , and was also interpreted as gyrosynchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      @xcite carried out 5 and 1.4 ghz observations of 5 ( non - magnetic ) o stars with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "they detected 3 stars , for the first time at 1.4 ghz band , with one star ( @xmath4 per ) inferred to show non - thermal radio emission while two other ( @xmath0  cam and @xmath5  cep ) were inferred to show thermal radio emission .",
    "in all cases , the observed flux was lower than their predicted thermal flux , based on the mass loss rates inferred from the h@xmath0 line profiles .",
    "they explained this discrepancy as due to a higher influence of wind clumping on the formation of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "in our program we also observed 3 magnetic o - type stars at 1390 mhz .",
    "none of these targets were detected ( see table  [ tab : gmrt ] ) .",
    "for one of these stars ( hd 37022 ) our upper limit is quite poor because it resides in a region with extended radio emission in orion .",
    "the high mass loss rates of o stars can make the wind optically thick due to free - free absorption out to a very large  radio photosphere \" .",
    "in such a case radio observations are unlikely to directly see the magnetospheric emission . on the other hand",
    ", they may probe the global mass loss , which is predicted to be quite heavily reduced for o stars with dynamical magnetospheres , due to quenching of the mass loss by the field and the resultant plasma in - fall @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the radius of the free - free radio photosphere , under the assumption of a spherically - symmetric , non - magnetic wind , using eq .",
    "( 4 ) of @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the free - free optical depth , @xmath8 is the mass - loss rate in units of @xmath9/yr , @xmath10 is the wind terminal velocity in units of @xmath11 cm / s , @xmath12 is the clump volume filling factor , @xmath13 is the frequency of observation in ghz , @xmath14 is the wind temperature in units of @xmath15  k , which we here for simplicity approximate with the effective temperature of the star , and @xmath16 is the distance from the star , in units of @xmath17 cm .",
    "we adopt a volume filling factor @xmath18 , i.e. a smooth , unclumped radio emitting region , since it has been demonstrated @xcite that @xmath18 yields the best agreement with observations of thermal radio emission from hot stars when the @xcite scaling law for mass - loss rates is assumed .",
    "assuming @xmath19 , we have computed the position of the radio photosphere ( @xmath20 , in units of @xmath21 ) at 1390 mhz , using the wind parameters ( computed using the vink scaling ) and physical parameters reported by @xcite , except for hd 133880 , for which we use values reported by @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : stars ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .    if @xmath22 we expect the magnetospheric emission to escape the wind and to be detectable ( in principle ) .",
    "however , if @xmath23 , the magnetospheric emission will be hidden within the ( thermal ) radio photosphere of the wind .    in our sample , b stars show ratios of @xmath24 which are clustered around values 0.11.5 , whereas all the o - type stars have this ratio clustered between 10100 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "this convincingly demonstrates that the free - free absorption of the magnetospheric radio emission of the b stars likely is negligible , and that the principal cause of the null results for o stars is free - free scattering in the free streaming wind .",
    "current models of the magnetically confined winds of slowly rotating o stars imply that they host  dynamical magnetospheres \" . in this scenario , wind streamlines inside @xmath25 in the magnetic equatorial region",
    "are constrained to follow closed field loops . after the wind stream reach the respective loop top and shock , the cooling plasma returns to the stellar surface on a relatively short ( dynamical ) timescale .",
    "simulations @xcite predict that as a consequence of this confinement and fall - back , the global mass loss of o stars with dynamical magnetospheres should be significantly reduced , by up to a factor of 1020 compared to similar non - magnetic stars .    in the context of free - free absorption ,",
    "this reduction in mass loss has important implications for the location of the radio photosphere .",
    "the expected mass - loss rate can be estimated using equation 23 of @xcite , leading to a reduction of @xmath8 by a factor of more than 3 for hd 37022 , 5 for hd 57682 , and 15 for ngc 1624 - 2 . if we reduce the mass loss rate in eq .",
    "( 6 ) by these factors , for hd 37022 and hd 57682 the ratio @xmath24 is reduced to roughly 40 , i.e. still well outside the alfvn radius .",
    "however , the ratio for ngc 1624 - 2 is reduced to @xmath26 . at shorter wavelengths ( 3 - 6 cm ) ,",
    "this value becomes @xmath27 .",
    "hence multiwavelength radio observations spanning the radio spectrum have the potential to provide novel constraints on predictions of mass - loss quenching of strongly magnetic o stars like ngc 1624 - 2 .",
    "we have studied 8 o- and b - type stars with the gmrt in the 1390 and 610 mhz bands .",
    "our 610 mhz detections of the 5 b type stars are the first detections of this class of objects at such low frequencies .",
    "this indicates that free - free absorption of their winds is not able to shadow their low frequency emission .",
    "we also reanalysed archival observations of hd 133880 obtained in december 2009 , for which @xcite claimed non - detections .",
    "surprisingly , we do detect the radio emission in both their observations allowing us to diagnose variability .    for hd 37017 and hd 37479 ,",
    "we confirm weak variability of the 1390 mhz flux density , as reported by @xcite in 5 ghz band .",
    "the variability appears to be in phase with the variation of the longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "we do not find evidence of a double - wave 1390 mhz variation of hd 37479 ( as reported by * ? ? ? * ghz ) , although better phase coverage is necessary to robustly confirm this conclusion .    for the b star hd 36485 ,",
    "our observations suggest a relatively rapid change in the flux density in both bands in narrow phase ranges .",
    "this result needs to be confirmed by further observations .",
    "the cooler b star hd 133880 shows remarkable variability in both the 1390 and 610 mhz bands .",
    "even with our limited phase coverage , the initial results suggest that the fluxes in both bands peak at phases coinciding with the minor peaks obtained from atca data @xcite .",
    "we propose that this behaviour may be a consequence of ecme , first observed from the b8p star cu vir by @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon , only observable at low radio frequencies , strongly motivates immediate monitoring of this target .    there were no detections obtained for any of the three magnetic o stars in the 1390 mhz band . using the scaling law of @xcite , we are able to conclude that this null result is in general agreement with the expected free - free optical depth of dense winds of o - type stars .",
    "we also conclude that radio observations at higher frequencies will be capable of testing predictions of mass loss quenching of strongly magnetic o stars like ngc 1624 - 2 .",
    "@xcite commented that the radio spectra of hd 142301 and hd 215441 ( the two stars in their sample with the strongest magnetic fields ) exhibited a sharp drop in flux density between 15 and 22.5 ghz .",
    "they concluded that this suggests there is a cut - off frequency in this range . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic chemically peculiar stars with relatively weak magnetic fields showed flux densities that certainly decrease from the cm to the mm range . in our sample , we were able to measure spectral indices between 1390 and 610 mhz for 3 stars in common with the sample of @xcite . for two stars ( hd 37017 and hd 37479 ) , the indices were similar to those obtained at higher frequencies , suggesting a smooth decrement of the flux density . on the other hand , for hd 215441 ( the nondegenerate star with the strongest known magnetic field )",
    ", we obtained a spectral index that differed strongly from that derived by @xcite .",
    "this implies an equally significant change in the spectral index at low frequencies , and deserves further investigation .",
    "the results presented in this paper represent a first feasibility study of the detection of low frequency emission from magnetic o- and b - type stars .",
    "having demonstrated the general properties of a range of objects , we are now carrying out a larger survey to observe all known magnetic ob stars in radio bands from low to high frequencies .",
    "we are also performing monitoring of individual magnetic stars , in order to better understand the rotational variation of their fluxes and spectral energy distributions .     to @xmath25 versus effective temperature for the observed sample ( excluding hd 215441 , for which @xmath25 is unavailable ) . here",
