    "a fundamental idea in quantum field theory is that coupling constants which describe the strength of a given process are not actually constant but rather depend on the energy scale at which the process occurs ; in other words , the constants _ run_. in qed this running implies the increase of the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath1 , with the squared four - momentum transfer , @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] sketches the origin of this phenomenon in the case of bhabha scattering , @xmath5 : larger momentum transfers probe virtual - loop corrections to the photon propagator .",
    "-channel feynman diagrams contributing to bhabha scattering and the phenomenon of vacuum - polarisation .",
    "the sum of all diagrams including zero , one , two or more vacuum - polarisation insertions is denoted by the diagram to the left with the double - wavy photon propagator , with an electromagnetic coupling @xmath6.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the running of @xmath1 is parametrised as  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "this is measured with high accuracy in solid - state processes and via the study of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to be  @xcite : @xmath9 the term @xmath10 describes the running of @xmath1 in equation  [ eq : alfa ] .",
    "it receives contributions from three sources : lepton loops , top - quark loops and loops involving the five lighter quark flavours . at the scale of z - boson mass , @xmath11 , the first two contributions to @xmath10",
    "are precisely calculated as : @xmath12 @xmath13 as discussed in references  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the contribution from the five lighter quarks , @xmath14 , is difficult to calculate due to non - perturbative qcd effects and is estimated using dispersion - integral techniques as  @xcite : @xmath15 the electromagnetic coupling at the scale of the z - boson mass is therefore  @xcite : @xmath16    the study of fermion - pair production at lep , @xmath17 , allows a precise measurement of the z - boson couplings .",
    "these couplings are sensitive to electroweak vacuum - polarisation effects and therefore also to the running of @xmath1 .",
    "the quantity most sensitive to the running of @xmath1 is the effective vector coupling constant of z bosons and electrons .",
    "it is measured as @xmath18  @xcite . in the absence of the running of @xmath1",
    "its value would be @xmath19 .",
    "a global fit to several standard model observables allows to constrain the value of @xmath1 at the scale of the z - boson mass as  @xcite : @xmath20 which is in remarkable agreement with the expected value of equation  [ eq : alphabolek ] .",
    "however , this determination of @xmath21 is based on the assumption of the full electroweak theory and a determination which relies on less hypotheses is desirable .",
    "the study of bhabha scattering , discussed in the following , allows a more direct insight in the running of @xmath1 .",
    "the study of bhabha scattering at @xmath0 colliders offers a unique window on the vacuum - polarisation insertions depicted in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "its measurement gives access to the running of @xmath1 in the _ space - like _ region , @xmath22 .",
    "the experimental conditions at @xmath0 colliders are extremely favourable as they allow a precise determination of the four - momentum transfer through its dependence on the squared centre - of - mass energy , @xmath23 , and on the scattering angle , @xmath24 : @xmath25 indeed , at @xmath0 colliders , @xmath23 is accurately known and detectors are conceived for a precise measurement of @xmath24 . in the following ,",
    "bhabha scattering is studied in two angular regions : low - angle , @xmath26 , and large - angle , @xmath27 .",
    "these angular regions correspond to two energy regimes : low-@xmath4 and high-@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the relation between the differential cross section of bhabha scattering and the electromagnetic coupling is : @xmath28 where the tree - level cross section is : @xmath29 the @xmath23-channel contributions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are much smaller than the radiative corrections , @xmath32 .",
    "these three quantities are known with a good accuracy compared to the experimental precision of the study of low- and large - angle bhabha scattering .",
    "navely , one could imagine to measure the cross section for bhabha scattering and then insert the result in the left - hand side of equation  [ eq : sigma ] in order to extract a value for @xmath33 .",
    "this argument is unfortunately flawed : the measurement of the cross section requires knowledge of the integrated luminosity . at lep this is estimated by counting events from low - angle bhabha scattering and assuming the cross section of this process to be known , what can only happen if @xmath33 is known to start with : a _ catch-22 _  @xcite !    as discussed above ,",
    "the information on @xmath33 contained in the scale of the differential cross section @xmath34 can not be directly unlocked . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of this differential cross section contains information on the running of @xmath33 over the @xmath35 range in which the cross section is measured .",
    "qed predicts that @xmath33 increases with @xmath36 : if the running is slower than the one expected in qed , the differential cross section will be steeper than expected ; if the running is faster than expected in qed , the differential cross section will be flatter than expected .",
    "the strategy to access information on the running of @xmath1 is therefore to analyse the shape of the differential cross section over a @xmath35 range and compare it with the expectation from qed .",
    "five such analyses exist and are presented below : we first discuss three early measurements of the running of @xmath1 at tristan and lep , and then describe two recent measurements performed by the opal and l3 collaborations by investigating low - angle and large - angle bhabha scattering at lep .",
    "lep experiments were equipped with low - angle calorimeters , called luminosity monitors , engineered to detect events from low - angle bhabha scattering in order to measure the integrated luminosity .",
    "the event counts in different polar - angle regions of the luminosity monitors depend on the shape of the differential cross section of bhabha scattering and , through equation  [ eq : sigma ] , give access to the running of @xmath33 .",
    "the first study of the running of @xmath1 using low - angle bhabha scattering was performed by the l3 collaboration .",
    "a total of about 7 million events collected at @xmath37 in the luminosity monitor , covering a polar angle @xmath38 , were used to probe the running of @xmath1 in the region @xmath39  @xcite .     for a subset of data collected at the z - boson pole .",
    "the solid circles correspond to the qed prediction and the open circles to the hypothesis of no running of the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "the data favours the qed predictions and excludes the no - running hypothesis . from reference  @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure  [ fig : l3old ] presents the ratio between the observed number of events and the qed prediction , as well as the hypothesis of a constant value of @xmath1 over the entire @xmath4 range .",
    "this ratio of data and predictions is fitted to determine the running of @xmath1 between the two extremes of the @xmath4 range as : @xmath40 where the uncertainty combines statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the qed prediction of 0.56 and first established the running of @xmath1 in this energy range , excluding the no - running hypothesis at 4.5 standard deviations .",
    "the running of @xmath1 in large - angle bhabha scattering was first investigated by the venus collaboration at tristan .",
    "they studied events collected at @xmath41 in the angular range @xmath42 to cover the @xmath4 range @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : venus ] shows the measured differential cross section as a function of the cosine of the scattering angle , normalised to the qed predictions with a fixed value of @xmath1 .",
    "the effects of the running are evident and the data favour a scenario in which both the hadronic and leptonic contributions are present in the running , as opposed to a scenario with just lepton loops .",
    "the results can be expressed as the change over the @xmath4 range of the term @xmath44 describing the running of @xmath1 in equation  [ eq : alfa ] : @xmath45 where the uncertainty includes statistical and systematic effects .    .",
    "the solid line shows the qed prediction for a running @xmath1 and the dashed line the prediction if the running is only due to lepton corrections .",
    "the data favours the qed predictions . from reference  @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a similar study at higher centre - of - mass energies and lower polar angles was performed by the l3 collaboration .",

    "the measured differential cross section as a function of the scattering angle is compared to the predictions as a function of @xmath1 , allowing to measure its running over the @xmath4 range as : @xmath49 where the uncertainty comprises statistical and systematic sources .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the qed prediction of 4.07 .",
    "the opal collaboration analysed low - angle bhabha scattering events to study the running of @xmath1 at low @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "data collected at @xmath37 with the luminosity monitor , consisting of layers of tungsten absorber and 32-pad silicon detectors , were used .",
    "this detector covered a polar region @xmath50 , corresponding to a momentum transfer @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis selects 10 million high - energy back - to - back cluster pairs and studies their @xmath36 spectrum to extract information on @xmath33 .",
    "data are divided in five @xmath36 bins and are compared with the bhlumi monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "the results of the study are quantified by studying the ratio of the @xmath36 spectrum observed in data and the monte carlo spectrum for the hypothesis @xmath51 , as shown in figure  [ fig : opal ] .",
    "values , for data and a monte carlo simulation with @xmath51 .",
    "the data favour the qed prediction for the running of @xmath52 and exclude scenarios with no running or a running due only to electron or lepton virtual loops .",
    "only statistical uncertainties are shown . from reference",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the data in figure  [ fig : opal ] are fitted with the function @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mean value of @xmath36 in the data sample .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 is related to the running of @xmath1 by : @xmath56 four hypotheses are tested by the opal analysis : no running of @xmath1 ; a running only due to electron virtual - loops ; a running only due to lepton virtual - loops ; the qed hypothesis of a running induced by virtual loops of leptons and quarks .",
    "the first three hypotheses are found to be completely excluded by data .",
    "the observed running of @xmath1 is derived from the fitted value of @xmath55 and equation  [ eq : b ] to be : @xmath57 where the first uncertainty is statistical , the second systematic and the third theoretical .",
    "the main sources of systematic uncertainties are the simulation of the detector material and the reconstruction of the radial coordinates of the energy clusters in the calorimeter .",
    "this results is in excellent agreement with the qed prediction of @xmath58 .",
    "this measurement proves the running of @xmath1 at low @xmath4 with a significance of @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , it establishes for the first time the hadronic contribution to the running with a significance of @xmath60 as : @xmath61",
    "the l3 collaboration probed the running of @xmath1 at large @xmath35 by studying large - angle bhabha scattering in the angular region @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "data collected at eight centre - of - mass energies in the range @xmath63 were considered , corresponding to a four - momentum transfer @xmath64 .",
    "about 40000 events are selected as back - to - back clusters in the high - resolution bgo electromagnetic calorimeter with matched tracks .",
    "these events are used to measure the differential cross section of bhabha scattering in ten different angular ranges , for each of the eight energy points , for a total of 80 measurements . the measured cross section",
    "are compared to the predictions of the bhwide monte carlo  @xcite to extract information on the running of @xmath1 . as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig : l3 ] compares the data and the predictions for the ten centre - of - mass - averaged cross sections .    , represented by the dotted line . from reference",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the results of the study are expressed by inserting an additional parameter , @xmath65 , in the description of the running of @xmath1 of equation  [ eq : alfa ] : @xmath66 a fit to the 80 data points , which takes into account the dependence of the measured integrated luminosity on @xmath65 shows that the value @xmath67 , corresponding to absence of running , is completely excluded .",
    "the data are in excellent agreement with the running predicted in qed , corresponding to @xmath68 , and the fit yields : @xmath69 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is dominated by theoretical uncertainties on the prediction of the bhabha scattering differential cross section both at large angles and in the luminosity monitor .",
    "some additional systematic contributions also come from the modelling of the detector response .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] summarises the lep results on the running of the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "the l3 measurement at @xmath70  @xcite is represented as a band , obtained by inserting the measured value of @xmath65 from equation  [ eq : c ] into equation  [ eq : runc ] and assuming the qed description of @xmath71 given in reference  @xcite .",
    "the two low-@xmath4 measurements by the opal and l3 collaborations at @xmath2 ( equation  [ eq : opal ] ) and @xmath39 ( equation  [ eq : l3old1 ] ) , respectively , as well as the intermediate-@xmath4 measurement of l3 at @xmath48 ( equation  [ eq : l3old2 ] ) are represented with two symbols each .",
    "the empty symbols represent the values of @xmath72 at the lower end of each @xmath4 range .",
    "they are fixed by using equation  [ eq : alfa ] and the qed description of @xmath71 of reference  @xcite .",
    "the full symbols represent the values of @xmath72 at the higher end of each @xmath4 range extracted from the fixed values and from the measurements in equations  [ eq : opal ] ,  [ eq : l3old1 ] and  [ eq : l3old2 ] .",

    "the full symbols represent the opal and the l3 measurements at low and intermediate @xmath4 .",

    "the solid line shows the qed predictions of reference  @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure  [ fig:8 ] presents a combination of all lep results .",
    "this combination is obtained in several steps .",
    "first , the l3 measurement at @xmath39 and the opal measurement at @xmath2 , from equations  [ eq : opal ] and  [ eq : l3old1 ] respectively , are combined into a single measurement . in order to perform this combination",
    "the l3 measurement is transported to the @xmath4 range of the opal measurement .",
    "the combined result is : @xmath73 where the uncertainty combines statistical and systematic effects .",
    "this combined result and the l3 measurement at intermediate @xmath4 are plotted in figure  [ fig:8 ] as two single points at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath6 at these two points are extracted by anchoring the value of @xmath6 at the lower end of each @xmath4 range by using the l3 measurement of @xmath65 at @xmath76 and assuming it also describes the running of @xmath1 for lower values of @xmath4 : the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are fixed by using the measured value of @xmath65 from equation  [ eq : c ] , the evolution expected from equation  [ eq : runc ] and the qed description of @xmath71 of reference  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath79 is finally extracted by using this fixed value of @xmath77 and equation  [ eq : combi ] , with an additional uncertainty which follows from the 14% uncertainty on @xmath65 .",
    "a similar procedure is followed to extract the value of @xmath80 from equation  [ eq : l3old2 ] .      in conclusion ,",
    "the lep experiments have established the the evolution of the electromagnetic coupling with the squared four - momentum transfer in a new energy domain .",
