    "currently , more than one thousand brown dwarfs have been identified over the past 20 years , either isolated , in binary systems , or in orbit around more massive stars . in particular , the sample of brown dwarfs orbiting stars has increased in recent years thanks to exoplanet radial velocity ( rv ) surveys .",
    "the rv method enables the determination of the companion s orbital parameters and minimum mass @xmath17 . with the assistance of the astrometric method , which allows the determination of the orbital inclination ,",
    "the dynamical masses of several bds have been measured .",
    "dynamical masses have also been measured for dozen or more brown dwarf binaries ( see , e.g. , table 1 in * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "we present the discovery of the new eclipsing brown dwarf companion epic219388192b , which was observed by the kepler k2 space mission during its campaign 7 .",
    "the uniqueness of epic219388192b stems from the fact that the host star is a member of the ruprecht147 cluster @xcite , providing a robust age determination .",
    "based on the spectroscopic , as well as near - infrared and optical photometric isochrone fitting to the dartmouth @xcite and parsec @xcite stellar evolution models , @xcite determined an age of 2.753.25 gyr for the ruprecht147 cluster .",
    "thus , a complete verification of the brown dwarf evolutionary models presented by becomes possible for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - observations ] we describe the k2 data analysis and the complementary observations from the ground . in section  [ sec - host_star ] we describe the physical properties of the host star . in section  [ sec - global_analysis ]",

    "if the wind braking were absent , the system would avoid the orbital decay with the star reaching synchronization at a rotation period of @xmath194.7  days and the orbit becoming circular with only a slight decrease of the semimajor axis thanks to the large reservoir of angular momentum in the present orbit .",
    "the decay of the system is therefore a consequence of the magnetic wind braking with a phase of reduced acceleration of the stellar spin when the tidal spin up and the wind loss temporarily balance with each other @xcite .",
    "the increase of the stellar radius along the main - sequence increases slightly the synchronization period , but does not affect our results .    the past evolution of the system is much more uncertain because we have no idea of its initial conditions .",
    "we may assume that the tidal interaction was not strong in the past because the rotation period of the star was too long for the excitation of inertial waves .",
    "as an illustrative model , we plot in fig .",
    "[ figure-09 ] the evolution with @xmath148 and a rotation period of 10  days at the age of 500 myr when our model assuming a rigid internal rotation becomes to be applicable .",
    "this is the typical rotation period of slowly rotating single stars of 1  m@xmath138 in an open cluster of that age ( cf .",
    "we see that the wind braking is initially stronger than the tidal spin up , but when the star reaches an age of @xmath144  gyr , the tidal torque becomes dominant and the evolution of the stellar spin is reversed .",
    "the decay of the semi - major axis and of the eccentricity is very small because @xmath147 , suggesting that the present eccentricity could be a remnant of the formation phase of the system .",
    "the above results are weakly dependent on the value of @xmath136 , that we assume to be @xmath149 in all our calculations , because @xmath150 .",
    "the rotation of the brown dwarf is rapidly synchronized with the orbital motion within @xmath151  myr for a wide range of @xmath136 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus we assume it is rotating synchronously since the beginning in all our calculations .",
    "the epic219388192 s membership probability to the ruprecht 147 cluster was reported by @xcite as `` possible '' .",
    "this was motivated by the radial velocity of epic219388192 measured by the authors to be 47.3  @xmath48 .",
    "this value is @xmath196  @xmath48 higher than the cluster s average rv , @xmath152  @xmath48 , which was determined by @xcite based on the rv measurements of six known cluster members .",
    "the systemic velocity of epic219388192 as measured using the not / fies and hjs / tull spectra is equal to 45.640@xmath200.010  @xmath48 and 45.840@xmath200.120  @xmath48 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath192  @xmath48 lower than the value measured by @xcite .",
    "one possible reason of this discrepancy is the high @xmath74 semi - amplitude of epic219388192b .",
    "the other one may be the systematic shifts of the rv offsets between different spectrographs .    on the other hand , our estimates of the distance , reddening and age of epic219388192 ( sect .",

    "we conclude there is now solid evidence for the star being a member of the ruprecht 147 cluster .",
    "in section  [ subsec - hri - subaru_ircs+ao188 ] we present the detection of two faint stars close to epic219388192 .",
    "if we assume that the two objects are members of ruprecht 147 , we can obtain further information on these stars . adopting the cluster s distance of @xmath63pc , the angular separations imply a distance of @xmath153 au ( se object ) and @xmath154 au ( sw object ) between epic219388192 and the two sources . the apparent magnitude @xmath155  mag of epic219388192 yields an absolute magnitude of @xmath156  mag .",
    "thus , the magnitude differences listed in table [ table-01 ] translate into absolute magnitudes of @xmath157 mag ( se object ) and @xmath158 mag ( sw object ) . according to the dartmouth isochrone table @xcite",
    ", such faint stars ( @xmath159@xmath16010 mag ) would be very late - type m dwarfs ( later than m8 ) or brown dwarfs , with their masses being less than @xmath190.1  @xmath161 .",
    "it would be of great interest if such multiple late - type stars , including epic219388192b , are clustered within a relatively small region .",
    "further observations ( e.g. , adaptive optics imaging in different bands ) are required to verify the memberships of those faint objects .",
    "at which @xcite report a gap in the mass distribution .",
    "the dark - green filled circles indicate brown dwarfs with masses above 45  @xmath5 .",

    "the dashed lines indicates the cond03 model radii and densities for brown dwarfs of 10 gyr ( violet ) , 5 gyr ( blue ) , 3 gyr ( black ) , 1 gyr ( light - blue ) and 0.5 gyr ( cyan ) . based solely on the fit to these models epic219388192b would seem to have an age of 1 gyr .",
    "[ figure-10 ] ]      according to the cond03 evolutionary models for cool sub - stellar objects , a 3-gyr - old brown dwarf with a mass of 36.5  @xmath5 should have a radius of 0.9015  @xmath2 and a mean density of 69.71  @xmath7 .",
    "our estimates of the radius and density of epic219388192b are @xmath0=@xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath162=@xmath6  @xmath7 . within 1-@xmath39",
    "they agree with the values expected from the cond03 models .",
    "however most of brown dwarfs known to transit ms stars seem to be inflated ( figure  [ figure-10 ] ) . commonly proposed mechanisms to explain inflated exoplanets , like their host star irradiation , tides , increased interior opacity or efficiency of the heat transfer , have little effect on brown dwarfs that are considerably more massive than exoplanets . the increase in the atmospheric opacity proposed by @xcite that accounts for the slower cooling",
    "is currently thought to be mainly responsible for radius anomalies of transiting bds . to verify this hypothesis , measurements of a secondary eclipse of epic219388192b in the infrared would be highly desirable .",
    "thanks to the known effective temperature from cond03 models ( 800  k ) and equilibrium temperature ( @xmath163=1164@xmath2040  k ) , epic219388192b is also a benchmark for testing the effects of stellar irradiation .",
    "the eccentric , short - period orbit with well - known age makes also epic219388192b an excellent - and unique - candidate to check the theories of star  brown dwarf tidal interactions in the presence of magnetic stellar winds ( cf .",

    "the orbital and physical parameters of the sample of known eclipsing brown dwarfs , as well as the atmospheric and physical parameters of their host stars have been recently presented in @xcite .",

    "this group consists of seven transiting brown dwarfs , among which six have orbital periods shorter than 100 days .",
    "the group of short - period brown dwarfs less massive than @xmath1945  @xmath5 is also quite well distinguishable on the period - density diagram ( figure  [ figure-11]b ) , as most of them have densities below 50  @xmath7 . with a density of 75.6@xmath205.6 @xmath7",
    ", koi-205b is the only object above this threshold .",
    "two brown dwarfs more massive than @xmath1945  @xmath5 ( corot-15b and corot-33b ) have densities below 60  @xmath7 . these are relatively young objects ( figure  [ figure-11]d ) still at the beginning of their gravitational contraction .",
    "as shown in panel c ) of figure  [ figure-11 ] , there are only two brown dwarfs more massive than @xmath1945  @xmath5 with radii above 1  @xmath2 , although with large uncertainties .",
    "most of the brown dwarfs with masses smaller than @xmath1945  @xmath5 have radii below or very close to 1  @xmath2 , and only koi-205b , with a radius of @xmath166  @xmath2 , substantially differs from the rest of this group .",
    "epic219388192b is an inhabitant of so called `` brown dwarf desert '' that refers to the paucity of bd companions relative to giant exoplanets within 3  au around ms stars .",
    "recently the `` brown dwarf desert '' was however limited only to sub - stellar objects with the @xmath167 between 35 and 55  @xmath5 and periods below 100 days @xcite .",
    "this casts doubts on the proposed distinction between brown dwarfs and planets , which is thought to be connected with different formation mechanisms .",
    "@xcite proposed that objects in the mass range 0.3 - 62 @xmath5 follow the same relationship on the observed mass - density plot , so they should be considered to belong to one and the same class of celestial objects .",
    "based on planet population synthesis , showed that the core - accretion mechanism proposed for giant planets formation may produce planets , not only more massive than 13  @xmath5 , i.e. above the deuterium burning limit @xcite , but also in the 2040  @xmath5-range .",
    "based on population synthesis calculations of the tidal downsizing hypothesis , @xcite have recently suggested that gravitational instability  proposed as additional formation mechanism to the most natural one for brown dwarfs ( via molecular cloud fragmentation )  can also lead to the formation of giant planets .",
    "the ages of most the stars known to host a transiting brown dwarfs  with the exception of a few young objects  are very poorly constrained ( figure  [ figure-11]d ) .",
    "any comparisons with theoretical evolutionary models , such as cond03 , are therefore limited .",
    "more detection of brown dwarfs transiting stars in clusters with robust age determinations are therefore highly desirable to test sub - stellar evolutionary models",
