    "one important question is what happens to the electronic structure when the extra electrons are added to the system via the fluorine dopants .",
    "a number of band structure studies have been performed to date to address these questions ; however , most of them use either the simple rigid - band picture of shifting the fermi energy in the band structure of the undoped system or the virtual crystal approximation.@xcite while these methods are expected to describe the rough picture , the actual positions of the dopants could make significant differences to the band structure as compared to the rigid - band shift or to the vca band structure , which is well known from the work on other systems.@xcite in this work , we investigate the band structure using full supercell calculations and study the changes in the fermi surface and the energetics with electron doping , with the fluorine substitution of the oxygen sites .",

    "these two methods were used to understand the effects of f doping on the o sites . in the vca the nuclear and the electron charge of the o atoms are increased continuously to approximate the additional electrons introduced by the f dopants .",
    "for example , a 5% concentration of f would change the nuclear and electronic charge of the o atoms from 8.0 to 8.05 . since superconductivity is expected to arise in the nonmagnetic ( nm ) state , we have focused on the electronic structure in the nm state .    .",

[ figdos1 ] ) , it might appear that the band structure for lafeaso is relatively unaffected by f doping , so that a rigid band shift of @xmath24 to accommodate the added electrons might be good enough to describe the states at the fermi energy .",
    "we find that while the overall shapes of the bands are about the same , there are enough differences in the states near @xmath24 to produce significant differences in the fermi surface for the doped case .",

    "[ figbands2]a for the 32-atom supercell with one f atom on an o site and a calculation without f doping but with the bands rigidly shifted . in comparing the two cases ,",

    "an important difference is the increased splitting of bands halfway between @xmath32 and @xmath33 at @xmath24 .",
    "previous calculations@xcite have predicted that a rigid shift would lead to no separation between these two bands at @xmath24 , but the supercell calculations show that these two bands remain apart .    turning now to the fermi surface , in the original brillouin zone of the standard unit cell ,",
    "the fermi surface consists of two hole sheets around @xmath32 and two electron sheets around @xmath33 .",
