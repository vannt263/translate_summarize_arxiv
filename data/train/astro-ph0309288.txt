    "low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) low - magnetic field neutron stars ( nss ) often show pairs of khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in their power spectra .",
    "the frequency separation @xmath4 between these ` twin peaks ' is sometimes observed to be close to the burst oscillation frequency @xmath5 , interpreted as the spin frequency of the ns ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; see chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ) , while sometimes it is close to half of it .",
    "recent work on the millisecond pulsar sax  j1808.43658 ( where the spin frequency is more straightforwardly measured , at 401  hz ; wijnands et al .",
    "2003 ) indicates that in those latter cases @xmath4 is half the spin frequency . in some , perhaps all sources",
    "@xmath4 decreases significantly with increasing qpo frequency .",
    "gx  17 + 2 shows a hint of a decrease at lower frequencies ( homan et al .",
    "2002 ) , but is consistent with being constant . in some sources , e.g. 4u  172834 ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) , the peak separation is always significantly lower than the burst oscillation @xmath5 , while in 4u  163653 ( jonker , mndez & van der klis 2002 ) @xmath4 varies between lower and higher than @xmath6 .",
    "two competing interpretations exist for these high frequency timing features ( for a review see van der klis 2000 and references therein ) which make definite predictions for @xmath4 .",
    "the relativistic precession model ( rpm : stella & vietri 1998 , 1999 ) is based on free test particle orbits around a compact object .",
    "this model identifies the ` upper ' khz qpo as the frequency of an orbit in the disc and the ` lower ' khz qpo with the periastron precession of this orbit .",
    "the rpm model predicts that the frequency separation @xmath4 decreases both when the khz qpo frequencies increase ( as observed ) , but also when they decrease to sufficiently low frequencies . in the sonic point",
    "beat frequency model ( spbfm : miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) an orbiting clump at the sonic radius is related to the production of the upper khz qpo and the beat between this clump and the ns spin frequency produces the lower khz qpo . in this model @xmath4",
    "should in principle be equal to the spin frequency , but can decrease when the upper khz qpo increases due to the spiral - in of the clump .",
    "so , both theoretical models ( rpm and spbmf ) can explain the observed decrease of @xmath4 with increasing qpo frequency . what evidence can constrain or test the validity of the models ? the two models predict different behaviours of @xmath4 as the khz qpo frequencies decrease : the rpm predicts a decrease of @xmath4 , while the beat frequency model predicts a steady or increasing ( see e.g. discussion in jonker et al .",
    "2002 ) peak separation .",
    "in addition , osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) developed the two - oscillator model in which explained the khz qpos as arising from oscillations of hot blobs thrown into the ns s magnetosphere .",
    "they identify the lower khz qpo frequency as the keplerian frequency of the blob and the upper khz qpo frequency as the radial oscillator mode frequency , a non linear function of the keplerian frequency .",
    "this model also gives a relation between the lower and the upper khz qpos ( dependent on the source ; see e.g. titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov 1999 ) which can be tested by observations .    in this letter",
    "we present the timing analysis of recent observations of the lmxb 4u  172834 .",
    "we find twin peaks with lower khz qpo frequency as low as @xmath0  hz , and the first indication for a significant decrease of the khz qpo peak separation as the khz qpo frequencies decrease .",
    "if confirmed , this evidence will strongly constrain theoretical models and , in particular , rule out the sonic point beat frequency model in its current formulation .",
    "4u  172834 ( gx  3540 ; forman et al . 1976 ) is a low - mass x - ray binary and type - i x - ray burster ( lewin 1976 ; hoffman et al .",
    "1976 ) , identifying the accreting compact object as a neutron star .",
    "hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) classified 4u  172834 as an atoll - type x - ray binary .",
    "strohmayer et al . (",
    "1996 ) found slightly drifting oscillations at @xmath7  hz during x - ray bursts , interpreted as the spin frequency of the ns . at high frequencies the source shows khz qpos up to 1,200 hz ( stromayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) often in pairs ( lower and upper khz qpos ) .",
    "these pairs have a frequency separation @xmath4 almost constant at @xmath8  hz ( i.e. significantly lower than the spin frequency ) for lower khz qpos between @xmath3 and @xmath9  hz , decreasing significantly to @xmath10  hz above @xmath9  hz ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) . no twin peaks with a lower khz qpo frequency lower than @xmath11  hz",
    "have been found in 4u  172834 until now .",
    "we have made timing analysis of 4u  172834 data from 1999 to 2002 performed using the proportional counter array ( pca ) instrument on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite .",
    "we have used standard2 data of the proportional counter unit 2 ( pcu2 , always on in all epochs ) to produce the cd of all the observations available in the rxte public archive ( from 1996 to 2002 ) .",
    "the soft colour and the hard colour are defined as the count rate ratio ( 3.56 )  kev/(23.5 )  kev and ( 9.716 )  kev/(69.7 )  kev , respectively .",
    "we have normalised the colours of 4u 172834 to the colours of the crab calculated with the closest observation available to each 4u 172834 observation . in fig .",

    "( 2000 ) found a gap in the cd between the island state and the banana state .",
    "this gap was only due to lack of observations .",
    "we concentrate on the observations filling in this ` gap ' in between island and banana , namely in the range 0.90.98 of the hard colour .      for the production of the power spectra we have used event data with a time resolution of 125  @xmath12s .",
    "we rebinned the data in time to obtain a nyquist frequency of 4096  hz .",
    "for each observation we created leahy et al .",
    "( 1993 ) normalised power spectra from segments of 16  s length .",
    "we removed drop outs and x - ray bursts from the data , but no background and deadtime corrections were performed .",
    "we averaged the power spectra and subtracted poisson noise spectrum according to zhang et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , shifted in power to match the spectrum between 3000 and 4000 hz , where there should be no timing features .",
    "we then converted the power spectra to squared fractional rms .",
    "we have fitted the power spectra with a multi - lorentzian model ( for details see belloni , psaltis & van der klis 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the power spectra of the gap observations are fitted using one broad lorentzian ( l@xmath13 or l@xmath14 ) to represent the low frequency noise and the break frequency , one ( l@xmath15 ) or two ( l@xmath13 and l@xmath15 ) narrower lorentzians between @xmath16  hz , a broad lorentzian around 100  hz ( l@xmath17 ) and one ( except two observations in which two are needed , i.e. with a single - trial significance @xmath18 ; see   3 ) narrow lorentzian to fit the upper khz qpo l@xmath19 in the range @xmath20  hz ( see van straaten , van der klis & mndez 2003 for details on terminology ) .",
    "fig .  2 shows a typical power spectrum of the observations analysed , with the best - fit model .",
    "the upper khz qpo is present in 46 out of 48 observations .",
    "the power spectra are consistent with those found around this position in the cd by di salvo et al .",

    "namely 50023 - 01 - 11 - 00 and 60029 - 02 - 02 - 00 , we observe both the lower ( l@xmath21 ) and the upper khz qpo . in 50023 - 01 - 11 - 00 l@xmath21 and l@xmath19 are single - trial significant ( see   3.1 ) at a 4.4@xmath22 and 7.9@xmath22 level , respectively . in 60029 - 02 - 02 - 00",
    "the significance is 4.5@xmath22 for the lower khz qpo and 3.4@xmath22 for the upper khz qpo .",
    "another observation ( 50023 - 01 - 31 - 00 ) shows a less significant ( @xmath23 ) lower khz qpo ( the upper khz qpo is significant at 10@xmath22 ) . in the observation 50023 - 01 - 11 - 00 ( see fig .",
    "[ twins ] ) the centroid frequencies of the lower and the upper khz qpos are @xmath24  hz and @xmath25  hz , respectively .",
    "the peak separation is @xmath1 . in the observation 60029 - 02 - 02 - 00 the centroid frequencies of the lower and the upper khz qpos are @xmath26  hz and @xmath27  hz , respectively .",
    "the peak separation is @xmath28 . to check for frequency variations in the khz peaks we divided observation 50023 - 01 - 11 - 00 in to four time segments and observation 60029 - 02 - 02 - 00 in to two segments , and analysed the power spectra of these segments .",
    "we note that 60029 - 02 - 02 - 00 is ` naturally ' divided in two by an x - ray burst , hence in this case we have analysed the pre - burst and post - burst power spectra .",
    "no significant frequency variations are present in either observation .",
    "the number of gap observations analysed ( observations with the hard colour in the range 0.90.98 and with event data with a time resolution of 125  @xmath12s ) is 48 .",
    "when we look for a timing feature , the probability of a statistical fluctuation in the power spectrum at a certain frequency increases with the number of trials , i.e. with the number of power spectra searched , and with the range of frequencies @xmath29 in which we expect the qpo .",
    "we estimate the total number of trials as _ number of power spectra _ @xmath30 . as reported in fig .  3 , in observation 50023 - 01 - 11 - 00 we have a very significant upper khz qpo at 582  hz .",
    "we expect the lower khz qpo ( which has a @xmath31  hz ) in an interval of frequencies of about 200  hz .",
    "this leads to @xmath32 . @xmath33",
    "single - trial significance means a chance probability of @xmath34 which multiplied by 48 trials and by 4.4 gives @xmath35 : the qpo is still significant at a @xmath36 level .",
    "the khz qpos at @xmath37 and @xmath38  hz of the observation 60029 - 02 - 02 - 00 turn out to be only marginally significant , below @xmath36 .",
    "therefore only one gap observation can be reported to show evidence of twin peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "we have analysed the observations of 4u  172834 , filling in the ` gap ' in the cd ( found by di  salvo et al . 2002 ) in between island and banana , namely in the range 0.90.98 of the hard colour ( see fig .  1 ) . in one of these observation",
    "we find two significant khz qpos with a lower khz qpo as low as 308  hz ( the lowest ` lower ' khz qpo ever found in this source ) .",
    "the lower khz qpo has an amplitude of @xmath39 per cent ( rms ) and q=@xmath40 ; the upper khz qpo has @xmath41 per cent rms and q=@xmath42 .",
    "do these features fit in the overall timing behaviour of the source ?",
    "the amplitudes vs. @xmath43 of the khz qpos of 4u  172834 are shown in fig .  1 of mndez & van der klis ( 2001 ) .",
    "the lower and the upper khz qpos form two distinct traces in the plot ; the upper khz qpo we find fits perfectly in the upper khz qpo trace .",
    "the lower khz qpo appears discrepant , but there are no other lower khz qpo measurements below @xmath44 khz with which to compare .",
    "comparison of the upper khz qpo frequency with q and amplitude of both the upper and lower khz qpos ( see fig .  4 in van straaten et al .",
    "2002 ) shows that all the parameters of these qpos fit in the overall trend of the source . in fig .",
    "[ corr ] we show the characteristic frequency @xmath43 ( see belloni et al .",
    "2001 ) of the upper khz qpos ( @xmath45 ) as a function of the @xmath43 of all the other components used to fit the power spectra of 4u  172834 .",
    "the grey points are from van straaten et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the black points are from the observation 50023 - 01 - 11 - 00 . the upper khz qpo frequency of the observation 50023 - 01 - 11 - 00 is consistent with the correlations found with all the other components and in particular extend the l@xmath21l@xmath19 correlation ( stars ) to lower frequencies .",
    "the location of l@xmath21 at @xmath46  hz is too high for a hhz qpo which in any case is separately detected ( fig .",
    "whether or not the ` gap ' in the l@xmath21l@xmath19 correlation ( diamonds in fig .",
    "[ corr ] ) between @xmath47  hz is real must be further investigated .",
    "clearly , bridging this gap would increase our confidence in the identification of the peak at @xmath0  hz .    the peak separation of the khz qpos we have found ( @xmath48  hz ) is significantly lower than both the spin frequency as inferred by burst oscillations ( @xmath7  hz ; strohmayer et al . 1996 ) and the ` saturation ' value ( at @xmath49  hz ) found by mndez & van der klis ( 1999 ) in the range @xmath50  hz . in fig .",
    "[ delta ] we show the peak frequency separation @xmath4 as a function of the lower khz qpo frequency .",
    "black points are from mndez & van der klis ( 1999 ) and the open circle is our observation . the solid line indicates the frequency of the burst oscillations at 363.9  hz ( strohmayer et al .",
    "this indicates a decrease of the peak frequency separation at low frequencies .",
    "this decrease is contrary to what is expected from the spbfm , which predicts a steady or increasing peak frequency separation at low frequencies ( see e.g. fig .  2 in lamb & miller 2001 ) . a clear prediction of a decrease of @xmath4 is made by the rpm .",
    "however , it seems that the decrease at low frequencies we find is steeper than the one predicted by the rpm : see e.g. fig .  1 in stella & vietri ( 1999 ) .",
    "we have also checked the relation between the upper and lower khz qpos as predicted by the two - oscillator model .",
    "we have used the values of the constant parameters of equation 15 in osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) as determined by titarchuk , osherovich & kuznetsov ( 1999 ) for 4u  172834 . for a low frequency qpo of 308  hz",
    "the two - oscillator model predicts an upper khz qpo of @xmath51  hz , much higher than the one observed .",
