    "the rotation curves highlighted by the circular motion of stars or more accurately characterised by the spectroscopic detection of the motion of neutral hydrogen and other gases in the disk regions of spiral galaxies have caused concern for astronomers for many decades .",
    "newton s law of gravitation predicts much lower orbital speeds than those measured in the disk regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "most luminous galaxies show slightly declining rotation curves ( orbital speed vs radial position from nucleus ) in the regions outside the star bearing disk , coming down from a broad maximum in the disk .",
    "intermediate mass galaxies have mostly nearly flat rotation speeds along the disk radius .",
    "lower luminosity galaxies usually have monotonically increasing orbital velocities across the disk .",
    "( see @xcite for a good review . )",
    "the traditional solution has been to invoke halo ` dark matter ' @xcite that surrounds the galaxy but is transparent to all forms of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "in fact , astronomers have traditionally resorted to ` dark matter ' whenever known laws of physics were unable to explain the observed dynamics .    in 1983",
    "milgrom introduced his mond @xcite , an empirical approach , which attempts to modify newtonian dynamics in the region of very low acceleration .",
    "newton s law describes a force proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radial position , but milgrom finds that a @xmath2 law fits the data very well @xcite .",
    "others have also attempted to formulate modified force laws , such as disney @xcite , wright @xcite and carmeli @xcite .",
    "the latter formulated a modification and an extension of einstein s general theory , in an expanding universe taking into account the hubble expansion , which imposes an additional constraint on the dynamics of particles @xcite .",
    "carmeli believes the usual assumptions in deriving newton s gravitational force law from general relativity are insufficient , that gases and stars in the arms of spiral galaxies are not immune from hubble flow . as a consequence a universal constant @xmath3 ( in this case",
    ", slightly different to milgrom s ) is introduced as the minimum acceleration in the cosmos .",
    "using this theory carmeli @xcite successfully provided a theoretical description of the tully - fisher law , deriving the proportionality between the fourth power of the galaxy s rotation speed ( @xmath4 ) and its mass ( @xmath5 ) , vis-@xmath6-vis    @xmath7     + where @xmath8 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : tf ] ) can be re - written as @xmath9 and therefore the positive square root is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the newtonian gravitational acceleration .",
    "hence the latter is consistent with milgrom s phenomenological approach in the low acceleration limit .",
    "in the weak gravitational limit , where newtonian gravitation applies , it is sufficient to assume the carmeli metric with non - zero elements @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , ( @xmath15 ) in the lowest approximations in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here a new constant , called the hubble - carmeli constant , is introduced @xmath18 .",
    "the potential functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined by einstein s field equations and from their respective poisson equation , either    @xmath21     + where @xmath22 is the mass density and @xmath3 the universal characteristic acceleration @xmath23 . as usual @xmath24 is the speed of light in vacuo .",
    "the hubble law describes the expansion of the cosmos and the matter embedded in it .",
    "therefore the line element for any two points in this ` new ' _ space - time - velocity _ is @xmath25 . the relative separation in 3 spatial coordinates @xmath26 and the relative velocity between points connected by @xmath27 is @xmath4 .",
    "the hubble - carmeli constant , @xmath28 , is a constant for all observers at the same epoch , therefore may be regarded as a constant on the scale of any measurements .",
    "the equations of motion ( b.62a and b.63a from @xcite ) to lowest approximation in @xmath16 are reproduced here ,    @xmath29     + this is the usual looking geodesic equation derived from general relativity but now in 5 dimensions . and",
    "the second is a new phase space equation derived from the theory ,    @xmath30     + the solution of einstein s field equations in 5d result in    @xmath31     + where @xmath32 is the matter density expressed as a fraction of the critical or ` closure ' density , which in this model is defined by @xmath33 .",
    "from ( [ eqn : derivphi ] ) and ( [ eqn : phi ] ) it follows    @xmath34     +      by carrying out the differentiation with respect to @xmath1 , ( [ eqn : accel ] ) becomes a new post - newtonian force equation    @xmath35     + for @xmath32 less than critical ( @xmath36 ) in or near a galaxy this means an additional force inwards is applied to the test particle . for @xmath32",
    "more than critical ( @xmath37 ) it represents an additional outward force .",
    "the solution of ( [ eqn : postn ] ) for small @xmath1 is the familiar newtonian equation . the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : postn ] ) carmeli neglects as small on a galaxy scale .",
    "but that would only be true if the matter density ( @xmath32 ) is a descriptor of space curvature on a much larger scale than the galaxy .",
    "if it describes the local density then the term is not insignificant .",
    "from ( [ eqn : derivpsi ] ) and ( [ eqn : psi ] ) it follows that    @xmath38     + integrating with respect to @xmath39 ( [ eqn : phasespace ] ) becomes    @xmath40     + which is the new post - newtonian equation for circular motion .",
    "for @xmath1 small , ( [ eqn : phasespace2 ] ) becomes equation ( 8) of @xcite .",
    "because the new dimension ( @xmath4 ) in the carmeli metric is constructed as an analogue to the time co - ordinate in the usual 4d _ spacetime _ , the meaning of the new equation is identified by the substitutions @xmath41 , @xmath42 . in this case , with these substitutions , and @xmath43 representing euclidean space , we recover the usual equation for circular motion .",
    "a possible ontology for ( [ eqn : phasespace2 ] ) is that even though galaxies are constrained by gravity against expansion in the radial direction , they are free to expand tangentially to the radius i.e. azimuthally in the plane of the galaxy .    it is known that some galaxies have portions of their disks , and the extended gas regions beyond , that rotate in opposite directions to each other @xcite . from the suggested ontology , it would be expected that this situation could occur . as a new galaxy develops the direction of rotation",
    "is determined by the initial angular momentum of the system . for",
    "proto - galaxies with low initial angular momentum different portions of the developing disk can rotate in response to the hubble flow force in the azimuthal direction , some parts prograde , some parts retrograde .      after integrating ( [ eqn : phasespace2 ] ) and solving for radial distance ( @xmath1 ) as a function of velocity ( @xmath4 ) with the condition @xmath44 ,",
    "we get    @xmath45     + which , to lowest order in @xmath46 , reduces to    @xmath47     + this is equation ( 9 ) of @xcite . for typical - mass galaxies ( [ eqn : rvsvapprox ] )",
    "describes orbital speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second . on small @xmath1 scales , or scales of small local orbital motion ,",
    "the effect of ( [ eqn : rvsvapprox ] ) is small .",
    "assuming @xmath1 small so the first term is negligible and integrating ( [ eqn : postn ] ) with respect to @xmath48 we get the familiar equation for circular motion    @xmath49     + where @xmath4 is the circular or tangential velocity in the system . simultaneously solving ( [ eqn : normalcircmotion ] ) and ( [ eqn : rvsvapprox ] ) by eliminating @xmath1 yields a tully - fisher type relation as in ( [ eqn : tf ] ) .",
    "this is the result of @xcite .",
    "the first term in ( [ eqn : phi ] ) and hence ( [ eqn : postn ] ) is valid where @xmath50 . by substituting @xmath51 into ( [ eqn : phi ] ) and assuming @xmath52 it can be shown this condition is satisfied when @xmath53 ( in si units ) , where @xmath22 is the local baryonic matter density . for radial distances within a galaxy ( @xmath1 ) on the scale of a few @xmath54s ( @xmath55 ) the density of material @xmath56",
    "this is true for most regions in a galaxy ; the exception would be near a compact object .    by rearranging ( [ eqn : postn ] ) using @xmath57 where @xmath52 we get    @xmath58     + note there is no term dependent on the hubble - carmeli time constant ( @xmath28 )",
    ". equation ( [ eqn : postng ] ) is a total local force law , and a post - newtonian equation .",
    "it needs significant investigation on the scale of galaxies , clusters etc .",
    "it indicates a gravity shielding type effect by the matter density field . for small radii from a central gravitating body ,",
    "the first term is insignificant with respect to the second term and ( [ eqn : postng ] ) becomes the familiar newtonian equation . for the sun - earth system the second term is about 30 orders of magnitude larger than the first",
    ".    for @xmath52 , ( [ eqn : phasespace2 ] ) becomes    @xmath59     + notice @xmath3 (= @xmath60 ) explicitly appears in this equation . in the limit of zero mass and zero distance ( [ eqn : phasespace2 ] ) can be re - written as    @xmath61     + which is the hubble relation .",
    "each term on the rhs of ( [ eqn : phasespace3 ] ) contributes half the gravitational radius cancelling the radius in the denominator .",
    "now ( [ eqn : phasespace3 ] ) , like ( [ eqn : postng ] ) , is galaxy specific and depends on the matter density in the disk . using ( [ eqn : postng ] ) a new expression for the speed ( @xmath4 ) of circular motion of stars and gases will be derived as a function of distance ( @xmath1 ) from the centre of a galaxy .",
    "real values of typical densities will be used to see if a connection can be found to the milgrom formula , which means @xmath62 as @xmath63 . in this case",
    "it turns out @xmath3 is different by a constant factor .    by substitution of @xmath64 into ( [ eqn : rvsv ] ) , for @xmath52",
    ", we get    @xmath65     + by integrating ( [ eqn : postng ] ) with respect to @xmath48 we obtain the new equation for circular motion    @xmath66    for @xmath52 .",
    "notice this equation contains a new term , which adds additional velocity to the stars and gases circulating in the disk region of the galaxy .",
    "but for small @xmath1 the term is insignificant .",
    "if we initially assume that the argument of the hyperbolic sine function in ( [ eqn : rapprox ] ) is much less than unity , that is ,    @xmath67    which implies @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "this is reasonable in some disk regions of galaxies , but when higher velocities are measured this approximation can not be used .",
    "using the expansion @xmath70 for @xmath71 , collecting terms lowest in @xmath72 and substituting @xmath1 from ( [ eqn : rapprox ] ) into ( [ eqn : newcircmotion ] ) for @xmath73 for circular motion , we get    @xmath74    for very low matter density ( @xmath75 ) this becomes the tully - fisher type law for galaxies as in ( [ eqn : tf ] ) .",
    "however where the approximation ( [ eqn : approx1 ] ) is true , it also follows that @xmath76 + hence ( [ eqn : vsqrdapprox ] ) becomes    @xmath77    and the solution for circular velocity is simply found .",
    "@xmath78    equation ( [ eqn : vsqrdapprox2 ] ) applies in all regions of spiral galaxies with densities that @xmath79 .",
    "densities in this range yield circular velocities in the disk regions like @xmath80 for galaxies with mass @xmath81 and @xmath82 for galaxies with mass @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is a solar mass unit = @xmath85 ) . for larger masses ,",
    "the higher velocities mean the approximation is invalid .",
    "therefore for higher velocities and/or densities @xmath86 ( [ eqn : rapprox ] ) must be used without approximation .",
    "we can write @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the milgrom acceleration inferred from circular motion and therefore it follows from ( [ eqn : vsqrdapprox2 ] ) that    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the enclosed mass at radius @xmath1 . by squaring ( [ eqn : mondapprox ] ) it follows @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the newtonian acceleration and @xmath93 , depending on the precise value of @xmath28 .    in the region of low acceleration on the edge of a galaxy where @xmath94 as @xmath95 large , and @xmath96 a constant , ( [ eqn : mondsqr ] ) becomes @xmath97 which is the low acceleration limit of milgrom s phenomenological law .",
    "let us assume a simple density distribution for a spiral galaxy valid in the disk region , expressed in cylindrical co - ordinates @xmath98 but with no @xmath19-dependence on mass density @xmath99 + where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are parameters to be determined .",
    "here @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is an exponential scale factor of order of several @xmath104 for a galaxy .",
    "therefore in this simple toy model the accumulated mass of the galaxy @xmath90 can be written as the sum of two parts , the bulge mass ( @xmath105 ) plus the disk mass , hence @xmath106 + which yields mass as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath107 + where @xmath108 .    also assume the density is uniform in @xmath109 and valid for @xmath110 , hence in the appropriate units , @xmath111 + substituting ( [ eqn : galmass ] ) and ( [ eqn : rho2 ] ) into ( [ eqn : vsqrdapprox2 ] ) we get for circular motion @xmath112    assuming @xmath113 , ( [ eqn : circ3 ] ) was fit to the velocity - distance data of ngc6503 from @xcite with the results shown in curve 1 ( dashed line ) in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the best fit parameters for @xmath105 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 were determined .",
    "the fit yielded a first order density dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "it also showed a good agreement , showing the correct trend , especially in the disk region , considering the simple model used .",
    "the total mass of the galaxy is then @xmath116 .",
    "therefore the disk comprises @xmath117 of the total galaxy mass and the total mass of the galaxy equals @xmath118 .",
    "this compares with published value of @xmath119 @xcite for the luminosity mass of the galaxy .",
    "it is underestimated , which is the reverse of the dark matter problem .",
    "but most importantly no dark matter is needed to explain the rotation curve .",
    "the shape of the derived dependence of the tangential speed of the stars to their radial distance from the centre of the galaxy is in accordance with expectation .",
    "a more comprehensive model though is needed especially for the region close to the central bulge .",
    "that should involve a gas component as well as a more precise model of the enclosed mass . also the approximate model used here",
    "would not apply as the density and orbital speeds will be greater in many cases . however the purpose of the toy model presented here is to show that it can work in the outer disk region of a galaxy and realistic though much smaller masses result from the fit than when halo dark matter is invoked .",
    "after substituting ( [ eqn : rapprox ] ) into ( [ eqn : newcircmotion ] ) , eliminating @xmath1 , a transcendental equation of the following form results ,    @xmath120     + where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .    equation ( [ eqn : general ] )",
    "must be solved for the motions of stars and gases in any region of a galaxy .",
    "an exact solution of ( [ eqn : general ] ) is of course not analytically possible but the solution may be visualized using a 3d plot generated by the mathematica software package .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it is apparent that as we follow a line of constant mass ( @xmath5 ) we see the tangential velocity ( @xmath4 ) increase as a function of local matter density ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the more massive the galaxy the less sensitive the curves are to changes in density .      as is noted in many galaxy rotation curves the velocity often rises and falls as a function of radial distance .",
    "this is indicative of changes in density in the disk region . in order to simulate the undulating density fluctuations in the arms of a spiral galaxy , which commonly are of the order of a few tens of kilometres per second @xcite ,",
    "i have chosen a density function as shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this function has a mean @xmath2 dependence on radius as per the result of the toy model above . using this function and a mass derived from ( [ eqn : galmass2 ] ) , replacing the density function , ( [ eqn : general ] )",
    "was solved for 20 fixed points along the radius , where mass and density are both functions of radius .",
    "the mass @xmath105 was adjusted to get the best fit to the simulated data of ngc6503 and the result is shown in curve 2 ( solid line ) in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the mass of the galaxy was then determined to be @xmath124 with @xmath125 of the mass in the disk out to @xmath126 .",
    "this is somewhat different to the toy model result above , and the fit is not as good , however i have tried to simulate the effect of density fluctuations .",
    "note it has not been attempted to simulate density and mass within the central @xmath127 .",
    "that will be left to future work .    by changing the mass of the central nuclear bulge from @xmath128 by 1 and 2 orders of magnitude the following curves in figure [ fig : fig4 ]",
    "were generated .",
    "curve 1 is the same curve as curve 2 in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , curve 2 is with @xmath129 and curve 3 is with @xmath130 in the central core . notice the stronger density fluctuations and the rigid body steep nuclear rise .",
