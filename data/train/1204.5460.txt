    "studies concerning the propagation of light in dispersive media dates back as far as brillouin and sommerfeld @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , new studies @xcite on the concept of pulse velocity were stimulated by the famous experiment @xcite , where light seems to propagate over the speed of light in vacuum ( superluminal ) .",
    "this effect takes place due to superluminal group velocities near the absorption resonance in dye solutions .",
    "beside absorptive dielectrics there exist metamaterials where index exhibit some unusual behaviour .",
    "these are constructed either using coherent population trapping @xcite , e.g. electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and index enhancement schemes , or spatial modulation as in left handed materials @xcite . beyond scientific curiosity ,",
    "applications such as memory storage / read out using slow light motion carried out the physics of metamaterials to an important status in the information technology .    in such materials ,",
    "dielectric response may switch from absorption to gain in mhz intervals for the optical frequencies .",
    "as well , index of refraction may display steep and negative derivatives . in those situations",
    ", it is confusing even to figure out the reorganization of the pulse beside facing the problem of superluminality .",
    "unfortunately , when the original pulse is severely modified there is no direct way to test the validity of the propagation velocity .",
    "the experiments @xcite measure either the peak of the pulse or mean absorption time .",
    "however , motion of the pulse peak or center may not correspond to a travel velocity since the shape of the pulse is distorted by mutual act of gain / absorption .",
    "for this reason , we adopt a method to test the reliability for a given description of velocity .",
    "we utilize the equivalence of the pulse dynamics within the real-@xmath0 and real-@xmath1 fourier expansions as the test tool in complex dielectrics .",
    "when the dielectric function is complex , there are two alternative mathematical approaches that are used in dealing with pulse dynamics .",
    "one can analyse the system equivalently using the real-@xmath0 @xmath2 and real-@xmath1 @xmath3 fourier domain .",
    "@xmath4 is the electric field that is used to calculate the velocity . in the real-@xmath0 or real-@xmath1 approaches",
    ", decay appears spatially or temporarily in the fourier integrand , respectively , since @xmath1 or @xmath0 is complex .",
    "if one is interested in the penetration depth , fourier expansion is carried out over the real-@xmath0 space . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is interested in the temporal lifetime of the pulse in the material , then real-@xmath1 expansion is used . in example , dealing with photonic crystals composed of complex dielectric materials , one constructs the master equation using real-@xmath0 ( real-@xmath1 ) fourier space for calculating the penetration ( duration ) of light into ( in ) the crystal @xcite . for a given velocity definition , pulse speed can be calculated within both approaches .    among different velocity definitions @xcite existing in the literature one of",
    "the most successful is the one that is introduced by peatross _",
    "_ @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , propagation is described with poynting vector average of the temporal position , i.e. @xmath5 . the velocity @xmath6 is introduced in this regard . on the other hand ,",
    "considering the same definition @xcite , a second velocity @xmath7 can be adopted similarly using the mean spatial position of the pulse , i.e. @xmath8 . since @xmath9 or @xmath10 average is dealt within the calculation of @xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively , it is standard to work in the conjugate fourier space where @xmath0 or @xmath1 is chosen as real .",
    "if the definition correctly addresses a physical flow , then the two velocities must be identical or at least must be very close .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the observed consistency of the definition @xcite with the experimental results @xcite follows from the equivalence of the detector time ( mean time for detector absorption ) to the arrival time deduced from this description @xcite . accordingly , here we choose to test the validity of this definition as the example .    in order to compare the two results for the given velocity definition , we perform the following .",
    "we first calculate the mean arrival time @xmath13-@xmath14 , from position @xmath15 to @xmath10 , for a distance @xmath16 .",
    "this is handled in the real-@xmath0 approach .",
    "second , we calculate the corresponding mean propagation distance @xmath17-@xmath18 , from time @xmath19 to @xmath9 , in the real-@xmath1 fourier expansion . for the purpose of comparison , we chose @xmath20 equal to @xmath21 which is the value determined in the real-@xmath0 expansion .",
    "afterwards , we compare the two distances , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for the same @xmath21 .",
    "thereby , we compare the two velocities @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we establish a connection between the two expansion coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 using the boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the velocity definition of peatross _",
    "_ @xcite in two different ways , by expanding the fields both in the real-@xmath0 and real-@xmath1 fourier space .",
    "we show that there occurs differences in the calculated values of the two velocities , especially in the superluminal region .",
    "iv includes our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we establish an analytical connection between the fourier components of the real-@xmath0 expansion ( @xmath26 ) and the real-@xmath1 expansion ( @xmath27 ) . in order to indicate that a variable is fixed to real",
    ", we use a bar accent over that variable . for instance",
    ", @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) corresponds to an integration over the real @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) space .",
    "we consider a dielectric function in the lorentzian form @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the plasma ( atomic transition ) frequency and @xmath33 is the damping rate .",
    "one can calculate refractive index by @xmath34 .",
    "the calculation of complex @xmath1 values for given real @xmath35 value is straightforward using @xmath36 .",
    "however , the calculation of complex @xmath0 requires the solution of the nonlinear equation @xmath37 for given @xmath38 real value . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot both integration paths in the complex @xmath0 plane , corresponding to real-@xmath0 ( @xmath39 line ) and real-@xmath1 ( @xmath40 contour ) .",

    "( @xmath39 : red thin @xmath43 line ) and real-@xmath1 ( @xmath40 : thick contour ) integration paths for index @xmath42 plotted for dielectric constant ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath40 contour is deduced from the nonlinear index equation @xmath46 for the real @xmath38 values .",
    "the two lines @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the branch cuts of the index @xcite .",
    "both branch cuts are below the real-@xmath1 integration path .",
    "length of the branch cuts are exaggerated only for the visual purposes.,width=307 ]    in order to relate fourier coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we consider the following simple reflection / transmission boundary problem ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . a gaussian wave packet ( of fourier coefficient @xmath49 )",
    "travelling towards right in vacuum ( @xmath50 ) is incident on the absorbing dielectric slab of index @xmath42 , see fig .  [ fig2]a .",

    "incident light penetrates from vacuum on the left hand side ( lhs ) to an absorbing dielectric slab of complex index @xmath42 on right hand side . ( a ) incident wave of fourier coefficients @xmath49 results a reflected wave of coefficient @xmath51 and a transmitted wave of coefficients @xmath26 .",
    "( b ) incident wave of fourier coefficient @xmath53 results a reflected wave of coefficient @xmath54 and a transmitted wave of coefficient @xmath27 . since on the lhs index is real and unity , it is simply @xmath56 and @xmath57.,width=364 ]    since both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are real on the left hand side , they are simply related by @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in the real-@xmath0 approach , using the boundary condition ( bc ) at @xmath58 , one obtains @xmath59 in this paper , for the sake of simplicity , we consider a gaussian profile for @xmath49 which does not have any pole .    additionally , the two solutions for the transmitted wave , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , must match at the boundary @xmath58 for all times . that is @xmath62 where @xmath35 , @xmath38 stand for real variables and @xmath63 is complex function of the real variable @xmath38 determined from the nonlinear index equation @xmath37",
