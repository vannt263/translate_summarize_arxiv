    "the dark energy provides a repulsive pressure on very large scales , but dark matter and baryons adhere gravitationally to form smaller structures .",
    "single - component systems and multi - component systems possess very different properties because of the complexities in dynamical interactions between the components , and between the components and the environment .",
    "for instance , dark matter does not radiate electro - magnetic waves but participates in gravitational interaction with baryons ( gas ) .",
    "however , the baryonic gas , which has a much smaller inertia than the dark matter , regulates the energy exchange of the system with the environment .",
    "we are still unsure as to the nature of the dark matter and how many dark - matter species are present .",

    "we also demonstrate the formation of solitary waves in cosmic walls when dark matter is self - interacting .",
    "galaxy clusters consist of about 85% dark matter and 10% hot ionised gas in mass ( see e.g.  vikhlinin et al .",
    "the trapped baryons in stars and galaxies have an insignificant mass contribution , and thus play a less important role in the cluster dynamics . for simplicity ,",

    "this implies that gas - free dark - matter collapse may occur under certain structure perturbations ( saxton and wu 2008 ) .    to investigate the global stability properties of the cluster , we consider perturbations to the stationary structure and carry out a linear analysis .",

    "our calculations show a trend that the strengths of the modes increase with the mode orders , implying that the higher - order modes grow or decay faster than the lower - order modes .",
    "the presence of radiative cooling of gas in galaxy clusters are expected to cause cooling gas inflow ( cowie and binney 1977 ; fabian , nulsen and canizares 1984 ) .",
    "however , this phenomenon has not been confirmed by observations .",
    "it has been speculated that the gas inflow may be halted as the radiative cooling may be compensated by certain efficient heating mechanisms .",
    "one argument is that hot electrons are injected into the intracluster medium by some means , e.g.  jets from agns residing in the cluster ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , this would require some fine tuning .",
    "if the agn injection is too strong the intra - cluster gas might be blown away ; if the agn injection is too weak it might be sufficient to quench the cooling flow .",
    "an alternative is the excitation of a cluster tsunami which could heat up the cool cluster core ( fujita , suzuki and wada 2004 ; fujita et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the original tsunami model ,",
    "the baryonic gas is trapped in a potential well created by a static dark matter halo .",
    "the sound speed of gas is high in hot outer cluster region than is much lower in the cool cluster core .",
    "disturbance ( waves ) generated in the outer cluster region may be subsonic initially , but when it propagates into the cooler cluster core , they could become supersonic .",
    "the waves will therefore pile up at the cool core region , leading to wave tsunami and shocks .",
    "the dissipation in the shocks presumably causes heating and quench the cooling flow .",
    "our analysis provides a more self - consistent cluster tsunami scenario , in that the dark matter halo provides a gravitational potential to trap the gas as well as acts a oscillator that drives the waves in the gas .",
    "the piling up of waves would occur as in the original tsunami model , but the tsunami is forced by the dark matter oscillations instead of self - excited .",
    "our finding that higher - order modes grow faster implies that long wave - length oscillations will break down into shorter wave - length oscillations .",
    "thus , energy in the global cluster low frequency oscillation will be transfered to smaller scale oscillations , causing tsunamis and shocks which dissipate and heat the cluster core efficiently and evenly .",
    "cosmic walls are semi - infinite two - component self - gravitating sheets . for self - interacting dark matter and baryonic gas ,",
    "the equation of the state is @xmath31 ( here i = 1 for gas and i = 2 for dark matter ) .",
    "since the dynamics are dominated by the dark matter , we may ignore the inertia of the baryonic component and simplify the conservation equations : @xmath32 the poisson equation is given by @xmath33 where @xmath4 are the deviations from the equilibrium background density @xmath34 .",

    "the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath46 are determined by the thermodynamics of the dark matter and the gas .",
    "note that the isothermal gas assumption , i.e.  @xmath40 , is not essential for the derivation of the kdv and the kp equations .",
    "the two equations can be obtained using a polytropic equation of state for the gas ( younsi 2008 ) .",
    "a family of solutions to the kdv equations and the kp equations are the solitary waves ( see e.g. belashov and vladimirov 2005 ) .",
    "solitary waves are non - linear waves , and they interact non - linearly .",
    "linear superposition predicts an amplitude doubling when two linear waves with equal amplitudes interact .",
    "however , collision of two solitons with equal amplitudes could form a metastable resonant pulse whose amplitude is four times that of the incident solitons .",
    "this non - linear superposition has important implications in the dynamics and structure formation of large - scale astrophysical systems .",
    "for instance , when the resonant soliton resulting from the collisions of dark - matter solitions of positive densities causes a depression in the local gravitational potential , if the resonant time - scale is larger than the dynamical time of the baryonic gas , the gas will be trapped into this depression .",
    "once the jeans instability threshold is reached , the trapped gas will collapse and condense into visible structures .",
    "as there is a larger amplitude enhancement in the soliton interactions , it increases the efficiency of gas trapping and hence the subsequent condensation .    in the quasi-1d case",

    "bright solitons are formed when @xmath56 but dark solitons are formed for @xmath61 ( younsi 2008 ) .",
    "the bright solitons correspond to dark matter density pulses with a positive amplitude above the equilibrium background density , and the dark solitons correspond to dark matter density pulses with a negative amplitude .",
    "the two types of solitons can co - exist locally in the presence of high - order perturbations , leading to the formation of ` double layers ' ( younsi 2008 ; see also shukla and mamun 2002 ) .",
    "the formation of weak filaments ( galaxies and galaxy clusters ) deep inside a cosmic void has been a challenging issue in astrophysics .",
    "conventional wisdom predicts no growth of structure inside large scale low - density regions , contrary to observation .",
    "the formation of ` double layer ' soliary waves in two - component self - graviating sheets may provide a viable model for the formation of such filament and void structures .",

    "dark matter oscillations in galaxy clusters can lead to gas tsunamis in cluster cores , leading to heating of the intracluster medium .",
    "dark matter solitons can be formed easily in cosmic walls , and resonance in soliton collision enhances gas trapping and condensation .",
