    "over the years , extensive research has been carried out seeking the exact soliton solutions of both periodic ( e.g. , sine - gordon , double sine - gordon ) and nonperiodic ( e.g. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) field theory models .",
    "for example , the exactly solvable sine - gordon ( sg ) equation @xcite and its quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) partner , i.e. , the double sine - gordon equation ( dsg ) , have exact single soliton @xcite as well as soliton lattice @xcite solutions .",
    "there have been some advances in the study of the _ hyperbolic _ analogues of these problems ; the exactly solvable hyperbolic analogue of the sg equation is the sine - hyperbolic gordon ( shg ) equation @xcite .",
    "this potential has only one minimum and thus does not support ( topological ) soliton solutions .",
    "the hyperbolic analogue of the dsg equation is the double sine - hyperbolic gordon ( dshg ) equation , which is a qes double - well potential with exact single soliton and soliton lattice solutions @xcite .    however , not much is known regarding the _ elliptic _ analogues of these problems . the elliptic ` generalization ' of the sg is the lam equation @xcite but ,",
    "as far as we are aware of , its single soliton and soliton lattice solutions have not been worked out yet .",
    "one would surmise that the elliptic analogue of the dsg equation is the associated lam ( al ) equation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we find below that this is not the case .",
    "generally speaking , the schrdinger equations with periodic potentials belong to a class known as hill s equations @xcite , and they lead to a band structure of the energy spectrum of the system . for both the sg and dshg potentials one could calculate the exact statistical and thermodynamical properties @xcite through a knowledge of the spectral band structure and their solitonic and phononic solutions , respectively .",
    "both al and lam are also periodic potentials with a band structure @xcite .",
    "although our goal in the present paper is only to obtain their exact single soliton and soliton lattice solutions , this will serve as a background for future statistical mechanics studies of the al and lam elliptic potentials .",
    "in particular , we obtain here the soliton lattice solutions of the al equation in different parameter regimes corresponding to different shapes of the al potential .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the corresponding single pulse and topological soliton solutions of the al equation can be immediately obtained from the lattice solution in suitable limits .",
    "furthermore , the soliton lattices and topological single soliton solutions of the lam equation are easily obtained by taking a different appropriate limit . besides",
    ", the asymptotic interaction between the solitons can also be readily obtained by using manton s formalism @xcite .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : we show that there are six different soliton lattice solutions of the al equation for different values of the parameters . from these six solutions",
    "we obtain the corresponding al single soliton solutions .",
    "it turns out that while in five cases these are topological ( kink - like ) single solitons , in one case we have a nontopological ( pulse - like ) single soliton solution . from the al soliton",
    "lattice solutions , by taking appropriate limits , we also obtain the corresponding lam soliton lattices and single soliton solutions .",
    "there are many physical contexts in which the lam equation arises , such as bond - order and charge density wave systems @xcite , nonlinear elasticity @xcite , and other contexts , e.g. , phase slips in superconductors and magnetoelastic interaction on curved surfaces .",
    "the al equation could arise in the above systems in the presence of external  electric , magnetic or stress  fields .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss some salient features of the al potential . in sec .",
    "iii we obtain the nontopological soliton lattice solutions of the al equation in different regimes in the parameter space and also compute the corresponding energies . in sec .",
    "iv we obtain the topological and pulse single soliton solutions of the al equation by taking the appropriate limits of the various nontopological solutions obtained in the previous section .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that in one special case , we obtain two different kinds of topological solutions of the al equation . as an illustration , in one particular case",
    ", we also estimate the asymptotic interaction between these single solitons .",
    "( in all the other cases one can follow exactly the same procedure , and thus we will not consider these here . ) as a crosscheck on our results , we recover in appropriate limit , the sine - gordon soliton solution . in sec .",
    "v we show that by taking an appropriate limit , we can also obtain the kink lattice and the topological single soliton solutions of the lam equation . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we summarize the results obtained in this paper and indicate some open problems .",
    "consider the following family of periodic potentials labeled by a pair of real parameters @xmath2 : @xmath3 that are called _ associated lam potentials _",
    "( since the corresponding schrdinger equation is called the associated lam equation ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the sine and cosine amplitude jacobi elliptic functions of real modulus @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and period @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the @xmath10-amplitude jacobi elliptic function of modulus @xmath6 and period @xmath11 ; and @xmath12 denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , see @xcite .",
    "we will choose the constant @xmath13 in the potential so that the absolute minimum of the potential  with respect to @xmath14equals zero , @xmath15 .",
    "the potential is periodic with period @xmath16 , except in the limit @xmath17 when the period reduces to k(k ) , as it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ assoclame ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath18 corresponds to the standard lam potential @xmath19 .",
    "there are two more cases in which the potential ( [ assoclame ] ) reduces to the lam potential .",
    "namely , when @xmath20 and also when @xmath21 , as shown below .",
    "therefore in all the calculations below we will admit that @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; the results for the standard lam potential will be recovered in the limit @xmath24 , and we refer to these results whenever the potential reduces to the standard lam one . from a physical point of view , if one thinks of a lam potential @xmath25 as due to a one - dimensional array of atoms with spacing @xmath16 and ` strength ' @xmath26 , then the associated lam potential @xmath27 results from two alternating types of atoms spaced by @xmath12 with ` strengths ' @xmath26 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "if the two types of atoms are identical ( which makes @xmath29 ) , one expects a potential of period @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , when @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 = finite and @xmath33 = finite , the potential ( [ assoclame ] ) reduces to the sine - gordon potential , @xmath34 and the results we present below reduce to the well - known ones for the sine - gordon potential .",
    "it is also worth noting that under the transformation @xmath35 the al potential  ( [ assoclame ] ) @xmath36 goes over into @xmath37 and hence for @xmath38 , as well as for @xmath39 , without loss of generality , we shall always consider the case of @xmath40 .",
    "further , instead of considering both the possibilities of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , it suffices to consider just the case of @xmath41 , but now @xmath43 can be bigger as well as smaller than @xmath44 .",
    "finally , consider the case of @xmath17 , when , by using the landen transform @xcite and choosing the constant @xmath45 , the al potential ( [ assoclame ] ) can be written as @xmath46~,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the complementary elliptic modulus .",
    "for the rescaled field @xmath48 and in the rescaled space coordinate @xmath49 the field equations [ see next section , eq .",
    "( [ stateq ] ) ] will remain the same as that for the simple lam potential .",
    "note that the @xmath17 case can not be obtained as a limit of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , since  as already mentioned ",
    "when @xmath17 the periodicity of the potential ( [ assoclame ] ) is @xmath12 , while for @xmath52 it is @xmath11 , see also @xcite .",
    "for the scalar field @xmath53 the dynamics is described by the second - order hyperbolic differential equation @xmath54 in the stationary case @xmath55 , this reduces simply to @xmath56 that can be easily integrated , at least formally , by quadratures .",
    "the time - dependent solutions are immediately obtained from here by lorentz boosting . the physically meaningful solutions ( bounded at @xmath57 )",
    "are given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the two ( suitably chosen ) integration constants .",
    "of course , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the absolute minimum / maximum of the potential energy with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , in view of the condition @xmath63 , the actual value of @xmath64 determines the appropriate integration domain in eq .",

    ", the potential @xmath65 has different behaviors in one period @xmath66 , and hence the nature of the solutions in eq .",
    "( [ quadrature ] ) is also different .",
    "there are three cases to be considered separately , namely ( i ) when @xmath67 and @xmath68 , ( ii ) when @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and , finally , ( iii ) when @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
    "note that in what follows we shall use the shorthand notation @xmath71 .",
