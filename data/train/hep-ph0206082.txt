    "the presence of large amounts of dark matter at the galactic lengthscale is already an established fact .",
    "it is currently thought that this dark matter is made of relique self - gravitating gases which are labeled as `` cold''(cdm ) or `` hot '' ( hdm ) , depending on the relativistic or non - relativistic nature of the particles energetic spectrum at their decoupling from the cosmic mixture @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hdm scenarios are not favoured , as they seem to be incompatible with current theories of structure formation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "cdm , usualy examined within a newtonian framework , can be considered as non - interactive ( collisionless particles ) or self - interactive @xcite .",
    "n - body numerical simmulations are often used for modeling cdm gases @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . however ,",
    "in recent numerical simulations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) non - interactive cdm models present the following discrepancies with observations at the galactic scale @xcite , @xcite : ( a ) the `` substructure problem '' related to excess clustering on sub - galactic scales , ( b ) the `` cusp problem '' characterized by a monotonic increase of density towards the center of halos , leading to excessively concentrated cores . in order to deal with these problems , the possibility of self - interactive dark matter has been considered , so that nonzero pressure or thermal effects can emerge , thus leading to self - interactive models of cdm ( _ i.e. _ scdm ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and `` warm '' dark matter ( wdm ) models @xcite-@xcite that challenges the duality cdm vs. hdm .",
    "other proposed dark matter sources consist replacing the gas of particles approach by scalar fields @xcite , @xcite and even more `` exotic '' sources@xcite .    whether based on scdm or wdm , current theories of structure formation point towards dark matter characterized by particles having a mass of the order of at least kev s ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , thus suggesting that massive but light particles , such as electron neutrinos and axions ( see table  1 ) , should be eliminated as primary dark matter candidates ( though there is no reason to assume that these particles would be absent in galactic halos ) . of all possible weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) , complying with the required mass value of relique gases , only the massive neutrinos ( the muon or tau neutrinos ) , have been detected , whereas other wimps ( neutralino , gravitino , photino , sterile neutrino , axino , etc . )",
    "are speculative .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite @xcite and table  1 for a list of candidate particles and appropriate references .",
    "in this paper we develop an alternative description of galactic dm .",
    "since the dark matter halo constitutes about 90 % of the galactic mass , we consider the galactic garvitational field as a spacetime whose sole , self - gravitating , source is this halo , described as a perfect fluid . assuming this galactic spacetime to be static and sphericaly symmetric ,",
    "the barionic dark matter can be though of as test particles following stable and circular geodesics of this spacetime curvature .",
    "since the tangential velocity , @xmath2 , along these geodesics can be calculated for such a spacetime , we can express the field equations in terms of of @xmath2 .",
    "however , the velocity profile @xmath3 has been observed for a wide range of galaxies , leading to `` universal rotatition curves '' ( urc s ) that provide an empiric fit to these rotation velocities@xcite .",
    "therefore , by inserting the empiric formula for the urc derived by persic and salucci @xcite into the field equations ( given in terms of @xmath4 ) , we obtain a constraint on one of the metric coefficients .",
    "once this constraint is solved , we can obtain the state variables characterizing the galactic dark fluid associated with this urc .",
    "we solve this constraint assuming that the velocities are non - relativistic , thus expanding around @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the terminal velocity associated with the flattening of the urc .",

    "provides a useful insight into how an ( in principle ) observable quantity relates to spacetime curvature and with physical quantities ( state variables ) which characterize the source of spacetime .",
    "if we assume that the self gravitating ideal `` dark '' gas exists in physical conditions far from those in which the quantum properties of the gas particles are relevant , we would be demanding that these particles comply with maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) statistics . following @xcite , the condition that justifies an mb distribution",
    "is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the particle number density , absolute temperature , planck s and boltzmann s constants .",
    "if the constraint ( [ eq : landau ] ) holds and we further assume thermodynamical equilibrium and non - relativistic conditions , the ideal dark gas must satisfy the equation of state of a non - relativistic monatomic ideal gas    @xmath22    whose macroscopic state variables can be obtained from a mb distribution function under an equilibrium kinetic theory approach ( the non - relativistic and non - degenerate limit of the jttner distribution ) @xcite . an equilibrium mb distribution restricts the geometry of spacetime @xcite , resulting in the existence of a timelike killing vector field @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , as well as the following relation ( tolman s law ) between the 4-acceleration and the temperature gradient    @xmath25    leading to    @xmath26    the particle number density @xmath18 trivialy satisfies the conservation law @xmath27 where @xmath28 , thus the number of dark particles is conserved .",

    "consistency requires that ( [ eq : n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) yield the same expression for @xmath18 .",
    "we shall assume for @xmath34 the empiric dark halo rotation velocity law given by persic and salucci @xcite , @xcite    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the `` optical radius '' containing 83 % of the galactic luminosity , whereas the empiric parameters @xmath37 and @xmath6 , respectively , the ratio of `` halo core radius '' to @xmath36 and the `` terminal '' rotation velocity , depend on the galactic luminosity .",

    "equations ( [ eq : m3 ] ) to ( [ eq : consist ] ) represent a relativistic generalization of the `` isothermal sphere '' that follows as the newtonian limit of an ideal maxwell - boltzmann gas characterized by @xmath69,@xmath70 and @xmath71 . in fact , using newtonian hydrodynamics we would have obtained only the leading terms of equations ( [ eq : m3 ] ) to ( [ eq : consist ] ) .",

    "together with typical values @xmath75 and @xmath76 yields @xmath77 kpc . evaluating @xmath72 at this values yields about @xmath78 , while @xmath72 evaluated at a typical `` optical radius '' @xmath79 kpc leads to about @xmath80 , an order of magnitude larger than the galactic mass due to visible matter .",
    "so far we have found a reasonable approximation for galactic dark matter to be described by a self gravitating maxwell - boltzmann gas , under the assumption of the empiric rotation velocity law ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "the following consistency relations emerge from equations ( [ eq : n11 ] ) , ( [ eq : n22 ] ) and ( [ eq : consist ] )          a criteria of aplicability of the mb distribution that is entirely given in terms of @xmath84 , the fundamental constants @xmath85 and the empiric parameters @xmath6 and @xmath86 ( the `` terminal '' rotation velocity and the `` core radius '' ) @xcite . for dark matter dominated galaxies ( spiral and low surface brightness ( lsb ) )",
    "@xcite these parameters have a small variation range : @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the constraint ( [ aplicab ] ) does provide a tight estimate of the minimal value for the mass of the particles under the assumption that these particles form a self gravitating ideal dark gas complying with mb statistics . as shown in figure  2 , this minimal value lies between @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath92 , thus implying that appropriate particle candidates must have a much larger mass than this figure @xcite .",
    "this minimal bound excludes , for instance , light mass thermal particles such as the electron neutrino ( @xmath93 ev ) . the axion is also very light ( @xmath94 @xmath92 ) but it is not a thermal relique and so we can not study it under the present framework .",
    "the currently accepted estimations of cosmological bounds on the sum of masses for the three active neutrino species is about @xmath95 @xmath92 , a value that would apparently rule out all neutrino flavours .",
    "however , recent estimations of these cosmological bounds have raised this sum to about @xmath96 @xmath97 @xcite , hence more massive neutrinos could also be accomodated as dark matter particle candidates .",
    "estimates of masses of various particle candidates are displayed in table  1 .          where we have taken @xmath99 .",
    "considering in ( [ eq : consist2 ] ) the minimal mass range that follows from ( [ aplicab ] ) , we would obtain gas temperatures consistent with the assumed typical temperatures of relic gases : @xmath100 .",
    "however , since we have no way of infering a value for the temperature of the ideal dark gas , we have no clear cut criterion for the estimate of a maximal bound for this mass .",
    "if we assume that the ideal dark gas is made of electrons or barions , so that @xmath101 or @xmath102 , then condition ( [ aplicab ] ) for applicability of the mb distribution is certainly satisfied and ( [ eq : consist2 ] ) implies a temperature of the order of @xmath103 k for electrons and @xmath104 k for barions .",
    "obviuosly , barions or electrons at such a high temperatures would radiate and certainly not remain unobservably `` dark '' .",
    "however , as long as the interaction is weak and the particles are not charged , we can not rule out any other particle candidate only on the basis of the gas temperature , even if this temperature is very high ( see figure  3 ) as in the case of massive supersymmetric particles .",
    "as shown in table  1 , a wide range of weakly interactive particles can be considered as possible main components of a mb dark gas , including popular supersymmetric particles ( the neutralino ) , as well as hypothetical light particles predicted by current literature based on wdm models of structure formation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main novelty of the present paper is the fact that it is based on a general relativistic hydrodynamics , as opposed to numerical simulations @xcite-@xcite , newtonian or kinetic theory perturbative approaches ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "finaly , the fact that we have obtained a minimal mass on the range @xmath105 @xmath92 , that seems to discriminate against very light thermal particles like the electron neutrino , coincides with the fact that these hdm particle candidates tend to be ruled out because of their inability to produce sufficient matter clustering @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in spite of these arguments , a self gravitating gas of this type of particles accounting for a galactic halo , would have to be modeled , either as a relativistic mb gas ( very light particles can be relativistic even at low temperatures ) and/or in terms of a distribution that takes into account fermi - dirac or bose - einstein statistics .",
