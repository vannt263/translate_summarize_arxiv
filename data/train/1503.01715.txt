    "although the recent advances in nanotechnology make it possible to study smaller systems than ever before , the systematic understanding of miniature structures of macromolecules attached to inorganic adsorbents is an experimental challenge  @xcite .",
    "the typical approaches of experimental verification of theoretical predictions and the theoretical understanding of experimental results is often limited to very specific questions  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "computer simulations are a comparatively inexpensive tool that allows for comprising studies , which can address generic problems as well .",
    "pertaining to polymer adsorption at substrates , generic properties of this transition include common transition pathways from the desorbed into the different adsorption phases or vice versa ( `` wetting '' , `` dewetting '' ) , but also transitions between structural phases under the influence of external factors such as temperature and solvent quality .",
    "general material properties of the adsorbent , e.g. , the propensity to bind macromolecules and the attraction ( or repulsion ) range , affect the binding process as well .    there have been numerous computational studies of this complex behavior by means of simplified , coarse - grained models in the recent past . yet , there are still more questions than answers about the nature of the adsorption phases that are difficult to approach .",
    "strictly , most of these structural phases are not phases in the thermodynamic sense , since the features of these phases and the transitions in between them are governed or at least substantially influenced by finite - size effects  @xcite .",
    "it has been a fairly profound finding that the thermodynamic behavior of compact phases of finite polymers is rather irregular due to discrete crystal symmetries and surface effects  @xcite .",
    "most of the recent generic studies aiming at unraveling the structure of the phase space and the adsorption dynamics have been performed for polymers and proteins interacting with a perfectly flat substrate with  @xcite or without pattern  .",
    "much less literature exists about polymer adsorption at fluctuating surfaces such as membranes  @xcite , because of the substantially increased complexity of the problem .",
    "flexible polymers can also optimally adapt to curved surfaces such as cylindrical substrates  @xcite , which causes the formation of polymer structures different from the adsorption phases at flat substrates .",
    "nanotube  polymer composites are a particularly interesting class of hybrid systems with potential for nanotechnological applications . besides the individual mechanical and electronic properties of nanotubes , in particular carbon nanotubes  @xcite , hybrid nanotube  polymer systems have an even broader spectrum of advanced applications in technology and medicine .",
    "these features have been exploited , for example , in photonics  @xcite and nanotubes coated with conducting polymers were used to design biosensors  @xcite .",
    "potential medical applications include serum protein - coated gold nano - rods for the selective targeting of cancer cells  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the polymer wetting behavior of nanotubes  @xcite is a key to further developments in the technological preparation of such hybrid systems .",
    "the investigation of the interaction of macromolecules with carbon nanotubes has also been the subject of numerous computational studies  .",
    "recently , we investigated the extreme case of polymers adsorbed on ultrathin nanowires and constructed a structural phase diagram based on stable low - energy states  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly interesting , because the nanowire geometry is topologically different from a nanocylinder , which leads to a different monomer ",
    "substrate interaction model . therefore , to consider the nanowire as the limiting case of a nanocylinder with zero radius is nontrivial .",
    "experimentally resolved structures , for example for the spread of glycerol droplets on carbon fibers and epoxy resin on aramid filaments  @xcite or liquid droplets at thin cylinders  @xcite , exhibit similarities to the adsorbed , globular conformations we found in our simulations of a simple coarse - grained polymer  nanowire model .",
    "the outer membrane of certain bacteria possess an ordered , hexagonally packed surface layer and although the units of the outer protein layer are not formed by polymers , images of long tubular portions surrounded by hexagonally packed units  @xcite resemble polymer - tube structures we identified for strongly attractive nanowires  @xcite .",
    "potential applications of hybrid polymer - nanowire assemblies include tube systems for the transport of small molecules that can basically be modeled in any desired shape .    in this paper , we extend our previous study of properties of lowest - energy polymer adsorption phases  @xcite by introducing the temperature as the external control parameter for thermal fluctuations . by means of generalized - ensemble monte carlo methods and by systematic variation of temperature and model parameters such as effective wire thickness ( volume exclusion ) and attraction strength , we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the structural phases of adsorbed and desorbed polymers and the transitions between them .",
    "the competition between energetic ordering and entropic diversity that causes structural transitions will be investigated by the conventional canonical statistical analysis of thermodynamic response quantities and more advanced approaches such as the microcanonical inflection - point analysis  @xcite .",
    "the latter method has proven to be particularly useful , whenever finite - size effects dominate or substantially influence structural transitions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "this move proves useful to avoid trapping in very dense conformations .",

    "topological transitions , common to all adsorption problems and typically accompanied by layering effects , can also be observed in the barrel phase . at very low @xmath18 values , where monomers are attached so close to the string that they can feel the attractive field of monomers of the opposite side of the string as well , the polymer `` tube '' looks rather like a one - dimensional chain with zig - zag ( or sawtooth ) pattern . in the other extreme case ,",
    "if the effective string thickness is too large , additional monomers will attach to the two - dimensional monolayer tube , essentially forming a new layer .",
    "three - dimensional assemblies with two or more layers are also known from atomic nanotubes  @xcite .    for comparatively large string thickness and sufficiently high adsorption strength , the polymer wraps only partially around the string .",

    "for the understanding of the thermodynamic behavior of the system , it is useful to perform canonical and microcanonical analyses of various thermodynamic quantities with the goal of identifying generic features of polymer adsorption at a stringlike nanowire for various parametrizations in the space of effective van der waals radius @xmath18 of the wire and its attractive adsorption strength @xmath50",

    "most pronounced in all cases is the significant peak at high temperatures , which corresponds to the adsorption transition . for fixed values of @xmath18 , the peak position , which we denote by @xmath52 in the following , scales almost perfectly linearly with the wire attraction strength , @xmath53 .",
    "this has already been found in adsorption studies at planar substrates  @xcite and can intuitively be understood by the larger thermal energy @xmath54 needed to release the polymer off the substrate at larger adsorption strengths .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning as well that the proportionality factor depends nonlinearly on the effective string thickness @xmath18 .",

    "@xcite into the @xmath59 plane to get an impression of how the compact adsorption phases at given @xmath18 and @xmath50 values look like .",
    "not surprisingly , the adsorption transition temperatures depend on @xmath0 and are different for the 100-mer , compared to the 30-mer . however , qualitatively the generic results are comparable .    after passing the adsorption transition , for temperatures @xmath60 ,",
    "dominant polymer conformations are either disordered and expanded or locally ordered and globular . for the adsorption of the 30-mer at the nanowire , these phases are difficult to distinguish . more striking is the crystallization transition at @xmath61 into the compact adsorption phases that have been described qualitatively in section  [ sec : cpd ] . as it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] , the low - temperature peak positions in the specific heat curves near @xmath61 , indicating this transition , do not vary much and , therefore , hardly depend on the material parameters of the nanowire , @xmath50 and @xmath18 . effectively , during this transition , the number of contacts between monomers and wire does not change much and the way in which the polymer binds to the wire has already been established in the `` liquid '' ( expanded or globular ) phase .",
    "note that , for strong attraction ( large @xmath50 values ) , the crystallization transition becomes weaker , the smaller the effective wire thickness is .",
    "this confirms the previous statement that the basic , tubelike structures have already formed in the `` liquid '' phase , with most monomers already in contact to the wire .",
    "if the wire attraction and thickness are comparatively small ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , the chain behaves basically like a free , flexible polymer , with minimal recognition of the wire , which is enclosed inside the polymer conformation for energetic reasons . in this case , the adsorbed liquid phase is preempted by the compact , crystalline phase .",

    "transitions from the desorbed extended ( de ) and desorbed globular ( dg ) phases , which are separated by the well - known @xmath65 transition line , into adsorbed phases lead to a variety of structures .",
    "however , given the rather small size of the polymer , these conformations can hardly be distinguished .",

    "the `` crystallization '' transition into compact phases dominated by the ground - state structures , however , is clearly visible .",

    "the transition points are defined by means of the derivative @xmath84 in the following way .",
    "if @xmath85 exhibits a local maximum and the extremal value is positive , @xmath86 , then the associated inflection point of the microcanonical temperature at @xmath87 must lie in a low - sensitivity region , in which an energetic increase has a minimal effect on the change of temperature within a certain energetic range . for a finite system , this entails the `` backbending '' of the temperature curve , which levels out in the thermodynamic limit and renders the maxwell construction exact .",
    "the energy that spans the transition range is associated with a nonzero latent heat @xmath88 , which is why this transition is referred to as a _ first - order transition_.    consequently , a negative local maximum @xmath89 , which also signals a low - sensitivity region of the @xmath77 curve , marks a _ second - order transition _ , because it corresponds to a transition _ point _ in energy space and , therefore , @xmath90 .",
    "note that according to these definitions the order of transition depends on the system size .",
    "it is not unusual that a transition with first - order signature in a finite system turns into a continuous , second - order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "not surprisingly , the order of a transition is also sensitive to changes of system ( or model ) parameters .    most strikingly , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : micro](b ) and  ( c ) for the 30-mer , the adsorption transition that we classify as a second - order transition at @xmath91 , turns into first order for larger attraction strengths . the first - order characteristic becomes stronger with increasing @xmath71 values .",

    "they coincide very nicely with the peak values of the specific heat curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermox ] .",
    "the scenario is similar for the 100-mer . the inverse microcanonical temperatures , plotted in fig .  [ fig : micro100](b ) for various @xmath71 values , exhibit features of a second - order transition for @xmath92 , before turning to first order at higher @xmath71 values",
    "this is very similar to the previously discussed case of polymer adsorption at flat substrates  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the increasing entropic suppression of states in the phase separation regime is that less states are available for each energetic state in the linearly increasing energy interval ( the energy scale grows like @xmath93 ) .",
    "since the desorption phase is almost entirely governed by translational entropy ( in a constant energy interval above the adsorption transition ) , and the energetically controlled adsorption states are shifted to lower energies ( below the adsorption transition ) with @xmath71 increasing , the energetic space in between is entropically `` emptied '' ( note that the total number of states is independent of @xmath71 ) .",
    "for the same reason , the slope of the double - tangents ( gibbs construction ) at the respective transition points decreases for larger values of @xmath71 , which effectively shifts the adsorption transition toward higher temperatures , which is consistent with the canonical analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : thermox ] .",
    "since the energy scale of adsorption is linear , the adsorption transition temperature scales almost linearly as well over a large range of the adsorption strength parameter , @xmath94 , which is a common feature of all minimally ( additively ) coupled adsorption models  @xcite .",
    "the increased @xmath71 range of second - order behavior of the 100-mer , compared to the 30-mer , is an empirical indication that the adsorption transition of a polymer at a linelike substrate is a second - order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is consistent with the general assumption that adsorption transitions of infinitely large systems are continuous  @xcite .",
    "this means that the width of the phase - separation regime , which is nonzero in the finite system , shrinks with increasing number of monomers and the per - particle latent heat diminishes for @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the thermodynamic behavior of structural phases for a hybrid model of a polymer interacting with stringlike substrate that resembles a  nanowire .",
    "this study extends the previous study of ground - state properties of the same system  @xcite by analyzing the influence of thermal fluctuations upon the adsorption transition and the formation of compact adsorption phases .",
    "results were obtained by means of advanced generalized - ensemble monte carlo simulations .",
    "we identified all major structural thermodynamic phases from indications of enhanced thermal activity in the specific heat curves and constructed the structural hyperphase diagram , parametrized by temperature and string attraction strength . as expected , for increasing attraction strength ,",
    "the low - temperature structures change from compact crystalline shapes that attach to the string or include it to barrellike conformations that resemble single - walled nanotubes .",
    "the transition into less ordered adsorption phases turns out to be independent of the adsorption strength , i.e. , the transition temperature is virtually constant . in contrast , the adsorption / desorption transition temperature scales linearly with the substrate attraction strength .",
    "a microcanonical inflection - point analysis revealed that the adsorption transition possesses an increasingly strong first - order characteristic , the larger the attraction strength is .",
    "however , it is important to note that this first - order behavior is a finite - system feature that is supposed to disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is only due to an effective , relative suppression of microstates in the phase - separation transition region , which is a finite - size effect .",
    "this does not contradict the common view that the adsorption transition is a second - order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "<S> generalized - ensemble simulations enable the study of complex adsorption scenarios of a coarse - grained model polymer near an attractive nanostring , representing an ultrathin nanowire . we perform canonical and microcanonical statistical analyses to investigate structural transitions of the polymer and discuss their dependence on the temperature and on model parameters such as effective wire thickness and attraction strength . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a complete hyperphase diagram of the polymer phases , whose locations and stability are influenced by the effective material properties of the nanowire and the strength of the thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> major structural polymer phases in the adsorbed state include compact droplets attached to or wrapping around the wire , and tubelike conformations with triangular pattern that resemble ideal boron nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the classification of the transitions is performed by microcanonical inflection - point analysis . </S>"
