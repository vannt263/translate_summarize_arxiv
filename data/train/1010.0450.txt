    "constructing effective invariants of transverse knots in contact 3manifolds that go beyond the obvious homotopy invariants has been a notoriously difficult problem . for knots transverse to the standard contact structure on @xmath1 , the first such invariant proven to be effective",
    "was constructed only recently , using combinatorial knot heegaard floer homology @xcite ; a related transverse invariant in the heegaard floer homology of a general compact contact @xmath3manifold was subsequently constructed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we define and combinatorially present a new invariant for transverse links in the standard contact @xmath1 .",
    "the new invariant is a filtration on the knot contact homology differential graded algebra ( dga ) @xcite , @xcite for transverse links and it appears to be quite different from the heegaard floer invariants . the construction of the invariant can be applied more generally to produce invariants of transverse links in any contact 3manifold and might even say interesting things in higher dimensions , but the details are considerable more difficult , as are the computations .",
    "so we defer the discussion of the general case to a future paper .      in @xcite ,",
    "the third author constructs a combinatorial dga associated to a framed knot @xmath4 and shows that its homology , combinatorial knot contact homology , is an invariant of framed knots .",
    "this invariant detects the unknot and encodes the alexander polynomial , among other things .",
    "the current authors prove in @xcite that the combinatorial dga is ( stable tame ) isomorphic to the legendrian contact homology dga of the conormal lift of a knot @xmath5 and also generalize the combinatorial description of knot contact homology to many - component links . here",
    "the conormal lift of a link @xmath5 is a union @xmath6 of legendrian tori in the unit cotangent bundle @xmath7 of @xmath8 with the contact structure given as the kernel of the canonical @xmath9-form .",
    "the legendrian contact homology dga of @xmath6 is an algebra generated by its reeb chords with differential defined by a count of holomorphic disks in @xmath10 in the spirit of symplectic field theory @xcite .",
    "its calculation in @xcite uses the contactomorphism @xmath11 to transfer the holomorphic disk count in @xmath12 to @xmath13 . the disk count",
    "is then carried out using the relation between holomorphic disks and morse flow trees @xcite .",
    "we will call the legendrian invariant of @xmath6 defined using holomorphic disks the _ knot contact homology _ of @xmath5 .",
    "we denote the underlying dga by @xmath14 and its homology by @xmath15 .",
    "the algebra @xmath16 is a free graded tensor algebra over the coefficient ring @xmath17={{\\mathbb{z}}}[\\lambda_1^{\\pm 1 } , \\mu^{\\pm 1}_1,\\dots,\\lambda_r^{\\pm1},\\mu_r^{\\pm 1}]$ ] , where @xmath18 is the number of components of @xmath5 ; the differential @xmath19 depends on @xmath5 as well , but we suppress this dependence to simplify notation .",
    "let @xmath20 be coordinates on @xmath8 and let @xmath21 denote the standard tight , rotationally symmetric contact structure on @xmath0 for links @xmath5 transverse to @xmath22 , we extend the coefficient ring of the knot contact homology dga to @xmath23,$ ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two formal variables which encode intersections of holomorphic disks with the natural lifts of @xmath22 that correspond to its two coorientations .",
    "the resulting dga will be denoted @xmath26 and has a double filtration : by positivity of intersections the differential @xmath27 does not decrease the exponents of @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "our main result is as follows .",
    "[ thm : mainintr ] the filtered stable tame isomorphism type of @xmath28 and hence its homology , is an invariant of the transverse knot or link @xmath5 in @xmath29 the dga can be computed from a braid representative of @xmath5 as described in theorem  [ thm : mainlinktv ] below .",
    "this invariant of transverse links in particular distinguishes transverse knots with the same self - linking number and with the same heegaard floer invariants , see section [ sec : hf ] .",
    "the explicit formula for @xmath26 is somewhat involved and is therefore presented separately in subsection [ subsec : computation ] .",
    "it should however be noted that our method for obtaining the combinatorial formula relies heavily on the explicit description of holomorphic disks used in the computation of knot contact homology in @xcite .",
    "an alternate and purely combinatorial approach to theorem [ thm : mainintr ] is worked out in @xcite .",
    "it begins with the combinatorial description of theorem  [ thm : mainlinktv ] in terms of a braid representation of the knot and proves invariance under transverse isotopy , without any reference to the underlying geometry , via a study of effects of markov moves .",
    "see @xcite also for various algebraic properties of the invariant and more detailed calculations which demonstrate its effectiveness .",
    "those familiar with the algebraic formalism of heegaard floer homology will notice that we can construct several other invariants from @xmath30 two simpler invariants @xmath31 and @xmath32 arise by setting @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "setting @xmath35 , on the other hand , reduces @xmath26 to the original knot contact homology dga , @xmath36 alternatively , one can tensor @xmath26 with an extended coefficient ring @xmath37 $ ] , to obtain a dga , @xmath38 it turns out that @xmath39 depends on only the topological isotopy class of @xmath5 , rather than its transverse isotopy class .",
    "[ thm : topnottran ] if @xmath5 is a transverse knot , then as a dga over @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath39 is an invariant , up to stable tame isomorphism , of the topological knot underlying @xmath5 .",

    "will not be proven here .",
    "we now turn to the computation of our transverse link invariant . to this end",
    "we first need to introduce some notation . our notation and conventions differ slightly from those of @xcite , in which the equivalence of conventions is discussed .",

    "so @xmath5 can be represented as the closure of a braid @xmath45 in @xmath46 .",
    "the braid @xmath45 is an element of the braid group @xmath47 for some @xmath48 and can be expressed as a word in the standard generators of @xmath47 and their inverses ; here the standard generator @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) corresponds to a braid that intertwines strands @xmath51 and @xmath52 positively .",

    "more precisely , by identifying @xmath56 with @xmath57 , we can identify @xmath6 with the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of @xmath5 , which consists of @xmath18 disjoint tori .",
    "each component of @xmath5 has a natural orientation given by the positive coorientation of the contact structure @xmath22 .",

    "in full , if we apply successively the eight tame automorphisms @xmath651 then we obtain a dga with the same generators but differential @xmath652 destabilizing yields a dga generated by @xmath653 with differential @xmath654 , @xmath655 , which agrees with the dga for the trivial @xmath9-braid above .    for the @xmath167-braid @xmath627 , we use the matrices @xmath656 the expression for @xmath657 from theorem  [ thm : mainlinktv ] now yields in particular @xmath658 we claim that the filtered dga for @xmath627 differs from the filtered dga for the trivial @xmath9-braid by setting @xmath659 and comparing @xmath660 for @xmath627 we find that @xmath661 , a unit in @xmath662 $ ] , and so the homology of @xmath663 is trivial . for the trivial @xmath9-braid , we obtain a dga generated by @xmath629 with @xmath664 and @xmath665 , and it is clear that this dga has nontrivial homology .      let @xmath667 be the transverse knots given by the closures of the @xmath668-braids @xmath669 respectively .",
