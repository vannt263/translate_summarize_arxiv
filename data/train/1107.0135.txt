    "the electronic properties of ultrathin films are significantly different from those of their bulk states due to their reduced dimensionality and the influence of substrates . in the case of oxides on metallic substrates",
    ", it has been predicted that characteristic features such as the on - site coulomb interaction energy @xmath0 and the charge transfer energy @xmath4 from a ligand to a neighboring cation would be substantially altered for atomically thin films.@xcite altieri _",
    "et al._@xcite observed that for an ultrathin mgo film on ag(001 ) , both @xmath0 and @xmath4 decreased monotonically as the film became thinner .",
    "they attributed the decrements from the bulk values of @xmath0 and @xmath4 in the film , @xmath2 and @xmath5 , to the extra - atomic relaxation energies @xmath6 that developed in response to the altered charge states of the ions .",
    "as the major sources of @xmath6 , they considered both the image charge potential energy @xmath7 between an extra charge and its image induced in the metal substrate and the polarization energy @xmath8 of the oxide caused by the extra charge also known as the madelung potential energy .",
    "the magnitude of the image potential energy should be larger for thinner films due to the smaller mean distance between an extra charge in the film and its image in the substrate .",
    "the polarization energy of the film should be different from that of the bulk oxide because the volume of the oxide in the film is reduced , whereas the polarizability is enhanced at the surface of the oxide .",
    "the resulting variation between @xmath6 in the film and in the bulk state , @xmath9 , even quantitatively reproduced the experimental @xmath2 for a 1-monolayer ( ml ) mgo film on ag(001).@xcite    nevertheless , the suspicion was raised that the successful reproduction of the experimental @xmath2 by @xmath9 could have been fortuitous , as there were many other effects ( such as dipole - dipole interactions ) that were not taken into account as well as unjustified assumptions ( such as @xmath10 dependence of the image potential on the atomic distance ) .",
    "moreover , chambers and droubay@xcite reported that both fe@xmath11o@xmath12 and cr@xmath11o@xmath12 films on pt(111 ) exhibited negligible @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "this contrasting observation was attributed to effective intrinsic screening of charge transfer , which reduced the extra - atomic relaxation to an undetectable level .",
    "thus , no comprehensive elucidation of the electronic properties of ultrathin oxide films on highly polarizable substrates seems to exist , and the number of experimental studies are very limited to properly assess the existing hypotheses .    the objective of the present work is to assess the existing hypotheses by comparing their predictions with experimental results for a different system : ultrathin nio films on ag(001 ) .",
    "bulk nio is prototypical as a charge - transfer insulator , @xcite and its charge fluctuation energies have already been studied.@xcite furthermore , the lattice mismatch between nio(001 ) and ag(001 ) is only @xmath13 2 @xmath14 , and the pseudomorphic growth of an nio film is well established.@xcite in other words , nio films grown on ag(001 ) are well suited for studying the thickness dependency of charge fluctuation energies such as @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain the coulomb interaction energy @xmath0(ni @xmath15 ) between ni @xmath15 electrons via the method of altieri _",
    "et al._,@xcite because the ni @xmath15 spectrum is difficult to isolate due to its overlap with the ag @xmath16 band of the substrate . instead , we study the interaction energy between ni @xmath1 holes @xmath0(ni @xmath1 ) .",
    "as the film becomes atomically thin , @xmath0(ni @xmath1 ) exhibits a substantial reduction from its bulk value .",
    "moreover , the extra - atomic relaxation energies represented by both @xmath7 and @xmath8 well reproduce the change in @xmath0(ni @xmath1 ) from bulk to thin film , @xmath2(ni @xmath17 , for a 1 ml nio film on ag(001 ) . using the observed values of @xmath2 and @xmath5 , we estimate the nel temperature @xmath18 in the mean field approximation that is found to be compatible with the experimental value of @xmath18 for a 3-ml nio film.@xcite these results reinforce the idea that the extra - atomic relaxation represented mainly by @xmath7 and @xmath8 determines @xmath2 and @xmath5 for ultrathin oxide films of nio , as well as mgo , on highly polarizable substrates .",
    "we performed _ in situ _ scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) , and auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) on ultrathin nio films grown on ag(001 ) .",

    "no charging effects were observed .",

    "the films were then thermally annealed at @xmath24 k at @xmath22 @xmath25 torr . in the present work ,",
    "we are especially interested in films within the monolayer limit , as this enables a definite comparison of experimental @xmath2 with theoretical values obtained by considering extra - atomic relaxation energies . however , for films less than 2 ml , the growth mode is somewhat complicated due to the ( @xmath26 ) reconstruction and the bilayer growth of the nio film.@xcite under the aforementioned growth conditions , we were able to grow 1 ml ( @xmath27 ) nickel oxide films , as assessed by a combination of techniques , including stm , leed , and xps .",
    "( further details are given in the following section . ) according to our previous extensive pes of nio films , such growth conditions also minimize the chemical defects.@xcite    the thickness of each film was mainly determined by the ratio of the peak intensity of the ag @xmath15 in the nio - covered region to that of the clean ag substrate , assuming layer - by - layer ( lbl ) growth of the film . because the growth of a nio film does not follow lbl in an ideal fashion , the thicknesses described in the present work are nominal .",
