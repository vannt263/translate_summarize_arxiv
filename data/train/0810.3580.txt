    "the origin of the extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray background ( egrb ) has been discussed in astrophysics for a long time .",
    "egrb was first discovered by the _ sas 2 _ satellite ( fichtel , simpson , & thompson 1978 ; thompson & fichtel 1982 ) .",
    "subsequently , the egrb spectrum was confirmed up to @xmath0 50 gev by egret ( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "the egrb flux is about @xmath5 10@xmath6 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 sr@xmath8 above 100 mev and the spectrum is approximately a power law with a photon index of @xmath9 in a wide range of @xmath030 mev  100 gev ( sreekumar et  al . 1998 ; strong , moskalenko , & reimer 2004a ) .",
    "it should be noted that , however , measurement of egrb is not an easy task .",
    "the galactic diffuse background from cosmic - ray interaction in the galactic disk is a strong _ foreground _ emission and must be subtracted to estimate egrb .",
    "therefore modeling of this foreground component could induce significant systematic uncertainties in egrb measurements ( keshet , waxman , & loeb 2004 ; strong , moskalenko , & reimer 2004a , b ; kamae , abe , & koi 2005 ; kamae et  al .",
    "2006 ) . a possible systematic error in the calibration of the egret detector may also have affected the egrb determination ( stecker et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "although several sources of gamma - rays ( e.g. , clusters of galaxies or dark matter annihilation ) have been proposed as a significant contributor to egrb [ see , e.g. , narumoto & totani ( 2006 ) and references therein ] , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of the blazar class have been thought as the primary candidate for the origin of egrb , since almost all of the extragalactic gamma - ray sources detected by egret are blazars .",
    "the blazar contribution to egrb has been estimated by a number of papers ( padovani et  al .",
    "1993 ; stecker , salamon , & malkan 1993 ; salamon & stecker 1994 ; chiang et  al .",
    "1995 ; stecker & salamon 1996 ; chiang & mukherjee 1998 ; mukherjee & chiang 1999 ; mcke & pohl 2000 ; narumoto & totani 2006 ; giommi et  al .",
    "2006 ; dermer 2007 ; pavlidou & venters 2008 ; kneiske & mannheim 2008 ; bhattacharya et al .",
    "these previous studies have derived different results by different approaches about the contribution of blazars to egrb , ranging from 20% to 100 % .",
    "a brief summary of these studies and comparison with our new result will be presented in ",
    "[ subsection : past ] . in our previous study ( narumoto & totani 2006 , hereafter nt06 )",
    ", we constructed a gamma - ray luminosity function ( glf ) model based on the picture of luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) , which has been known to describe well the evolution of x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of agns .",
    "nt06 found that the ldde model fits to the egret blazar data better than the pure - luminosity - evolution ( ple ) models employed in most of the previous studies .",
    "it is then found that only 2550% of egrb can be explained by blazars , with the glf model parameters that are consistent with the egret blazar data ( flux and redshift distributions ) .    in most of past studies including nt06 , however , blazar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) were assumed to be a single or broken power - law for all blazars . in such a modeling , the predicted egrb spectrum is almost obviously determined by the assumed power - law indices .",
    "blazar sed has been theoretically and observationally studied in detail ( ghisellini & tavecchio 2008b , and references therein ) . from the theoretical point of view , blazar emission is widely believed to be the sum of the synchrotron ( radio to uv bands ) and inverse compton ( dominant in gamma - ray bands ) components produced by the same nonthermal electron population accelerated in relativistic jets .",
    "the source of target photons for the inverse - compton ( ic ) component could be either the synchrotron photons produced in the jet itself ( synchrotron - self - compton , ssc ) , or photons emitted from the accretion disk ( external compton , ec ) .",
    "multi - wavelength observational studies from radio to @xmath10-ray bands have indicated an interesting feature in blazar seds ; the synchrotron and compton peak photon energies decrease as the bolometric luminosity increases ( fossati et  al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 , donato et  al .",
    "2001 , ghisellini & tavecchio 2008b , maraschi et  al .",
    "this is often called as the blazar sed sequence .",
    "although the validity of the blazar sequence is currently still a matter of debate ( e.g. , padovani et  al . 2007 ; ghisellini & tavecchio 2008b",
    "; maraschi et  al . 2008 ) , one can make a non - trivial prediction of the egrb spectrum if this blazar sequence is assumed .",
    "in other words , the blazar sed sequence can be tested by comparing with the observed egrb spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the egrb flux and spectrum from blazars , by constructing a blazar glf model that is consistent with the flux and redshift distributions of the egret blazars , based on the ldde scheme and the blazar sed sequence . by introducing the blazar sed sequence , we can make a reasonable and non - trivial prediction of the egrb spectrum for the first time , which can be compared with the observed egrb spectrum .",
    "recently , inoue , totani , & ueda ( 2008 ) has showed that egrb in the mev band can naturally be explained by normal ( i.e. , non - blazar ) agns that compose the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "this mev background component extends to @xmath11 mev with a photon index of about 2.8 , by the comptonization photons produced by nonthermal electrons in hot coronae .",
    "therefore , it should also contribute to the egrb at @xmath3 1 gev .",
    "we will investigate how much fraction of the observed egrb can be explained by the sum of the two components , i.e. , non - blazar agns ( dominant at @xmath3100 mev ) and blazars ( dominant at @xmath2100 mev ) .",
    "we will then make quantitative predictions for the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope ( atwood et al .",
    "2009 ; formerly known as glast ) that has successfully been launched on june 11th , 2008 , so that our model can be tested quantitatively by the observational data coming in the very near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sequence ] , we will present the treatment of the blazar sed sequence in our calculation .",
    "we will describe the formulations for the blazar glf model taking into account the sed sequence in ",
    "[ glf_model ] , and the glf parameter determination by fitting to the egret data in  [ glf_egret ] .",
    "the egrb will be calculated and compared with the observed data in  [ section : egrb ] , and we will present predictions for _ fermi _ in  [ section : fermi ] .",

    "blazars are defined as the combined class of the two populations of agns : bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "bl lacs are defined as agns whose nuclear non - thermal continuum emission is so strong that the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the strongest optical emission line is narrower than 5  .",
    "such domination of continuum is interpreted as the jet being directed towards the observer ; the continuum from jet is extremely enhanced by the relativistic beaming compared with more isotropic line emission from the regions around accretion disks .",
    "fsrqs are agns with emission line ew greater than 5  , but whose spectral index in radio band is less than @xmath13 0.5 , where @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 ( see urry & padovani 1995 for detailed reviews ) .",
    "although fsrqs show discernible emission lines , the flat radio spectrum is also an evidence of the dominating jet component .",
    "in fact fsrqs show similar properties to bl lacs , such as rapid time variability and strong polarization .",
    "these properties indicate that bl lacs and fsrqs are physically similar populations , and hence they are often combined into a single class of blazars .",
    "the parameter that discriminates bl lacs and fsrqs is likely to be the luminosity ; generally fsrqs have larger luminosities than bl lacs ( fossati et  al .",
    "1998 , ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we also treat the bl lacs and fsrqs as the single population of blazars .",

    "( 2001 , hereafter d01 ) constructed an empirical blazar sed model to describe the sed sequence , based on fittings to observed seds from radio to @xmath10-ray bands .",
    "these models are comprised of the two components ( synchrotron and ic ) , and each of the two is described by a linear curve at low photon energies and a parabolic curve at high energies , in the plane of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    here",
    "we construct our own sed sequence model mainly based on the sed model of d01 , because there is a mathematical discontinuity in the original d01 model . in the d01 model ,",
    "two different mathematical fitting formulae are used below and above the luminosity @xmath18 erg s@xmath8 at 5 ghz , and the luminosity of the inverse - compton component suddenly changes with a jump at this critical luminosity .",
    "our own sed sequence formula is described in appendix in detail , and the discontinuity is avoided there . once the blazar luminosity is specified at a reference frequency ( e.g. , 5 ghz in radio band ) , this empirical model gives the full blazar sed from radio to gamma - ray bands . in fig.[fig.sed ]",
    "we show this empirical blazar sed sequence model in comparison with the observed sed data ( fossati et  al .",
    "1998 ; d01 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the observed data are means of many blazars in a certain luminosity range , and there may be scatter of individual blazar seds from the sequence . when the bolometric blazar luminosity @xmath19 is specified , the blazar luminosity per unit frequency , @xmath20 , is determined for any photon frequency @xmath21 by the blazar sequence model .",
    "note that , although blazars must be strongly anisotropic emitters , @xmath22 is defined as the isotropic - equivalent luminosity and hence the observed energy flux per unit frequency is given by @xmath23 = ( 1+z ) \\ , l_\\nu(\\nu , p ) / [ 4 \\pi d_l(z)^2]$ ] , where @xmath24 is redshift and @xmath25 is the standard luminosity distance .",
    "the cosmological evolution of x - ray luminosity function of agns has been investigated intensively [ ueda et  al . 2003 ( hereafter u03 ) ; hasinger , miyaji , & schmidt 2005 ( hereafter h05 ) ; sazonov et  al . 2007 ; gilli , comastri , & hasinger 2007 ] .",
    "these studies revealed that agn xlf is well described by the ldde model , in which peak redshift of density evolution increases with agn luminosity .",
    "here we construct two models of blazar glf based on the two xlfs derived by u03 ( in hard x - ray band ) and h05 ( in soft x - ray band ) , both of which are based on the ldde scheme .",
    "the use of ldde in blazar glf has been supported from the egret blazar data , because nt06 found that the egret data agrees with the ldde model better than ple models .",
    "however , the validity of this assumption from a theoretical viewpoint should also be examined .    it is known that radio jet emission is linked to the dissipation process in the accretion disk ( falcke & biermann 1995 ; falcke et al .",
    "1995 ; merloni et al .",
    "2003 ; falcke et al .",
    "2004 ; krding et al.2006 ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that power of blazar jet is correlated with mass accretion rate onto super massive black holes , which is also correlated with the x - ray luminosity from accretion disk .",
    "therefore we simply assume that the bolometric luminosity of radiation from jet , @xmath26 , is proportional to disk x - ray luminosity , @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath27 is _ not _ the observed x - ray luminosity of a blazar having a jet luminosity @xmath26 ; when an agn is observed as a blazar ( i.e. , the jet directed to an observer ) , its x - ray flux is dominated by the radiation from the jet that is much brighter than that from the accretion disk .",
    "rather , @xmath27 is the luminosity that would be observed from a direction different from the jet .",
    "a constant @xmath28 ratio is realized when , e.g. , the jet kinetic luminosity ( @xmath29 ) is efficiently dissipated into blazar bolometric luminosity ( @xmath26 ) , and both @xmath29 and @xmath27 are proportional to the mass accretion rate ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "one should , however , be careful about the latter condition .",
    "recent observations of x - ray binaries indicate that @xmath29 is generally proportional to @xmath30 , but @xmath27 is not , when the accretion rate is much lower than the eddington limit ( i.e. , low eddington ratio ) ( gallo et  al . 2003",
    "; gallo et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "such accretion disks are described by radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riaf ) rather than the standard accretion disk , and @xmath27 is roughly proportional to @xmath31 in the riaf regime ( kato et  al .",
    "1998 ; narayan & quataert 2005 ) . the riaf picture is well consistent also with the accretion flow onto the supermassive black hole of the galaxy ( i.e. , sgr a@xmath32 ) ( see , e.g. , totani 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "accretion rates of x - ray bright agns used to derive the agn xlf are generally close to the eddington limit , otherwise they are hardly detected by x - ray observations because of the rapid decrease of x - ray luminosity with decreasing eddington ratio .",
    "therefore , our blazar glf should be considered as that for high - eddington - ratio agns , and low - eddington - ratio agns in the riaf regime could be missed in our analysis .",
    "such a low - eddington - ratio population might have a significant contribution to blazar glf , because we expect @xmath33 in contrast to @xmath34 in the riaf mode .",
    "however , the black hole mass function predicted by time integration of x - ray agn lf is consistent with the local black hole mass function inferred from the black - hole - mass versus bulge - mass relation , indicating that black hole mass grows mainly in the high eddington ratio phase ( e.g. , marconi et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "if this is correct , cosmic background radiation from jet activities should also be dominated by agns in high eddington ratio phase .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to expect that a significant part of egrb flux can be accounted for by blazars with high eddington ratio phase , whose glf evolution is described by ldde .      in this paper",
    "we describe the blazar glf in terms of @xmath35 luminosity at a reference rest - frame photon energy @xmath36 100 mev , i.e. , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the planck constant .",
    "according to the assumption justified in  [ section : jet_power ]",
    ", we simply relate the bolometric blazar luminosity @xmath26 and disk x - ray luminosity by the parameter @xmath39 , as : @xmath40 here , we define the disk luminosity @xmath27 to be that in the rest - frame 210 and 0.52 kev bands for the hard xlf ( u03 ) and the soft xlf ( h05 ) , respectively .",

    "therefore , their model is not a glf model for individual blazars , and not compared statistically with the egret data of blazar flux and redshift distribution .",
    "their model overproduced the observed egrb spectrum .",
    "dermer ( 2007 ; hereafter d07 ) treated bl lac and fsrq separately , using single power - law seds for the two populations with different spectral indices .",
    "the variation of the absolute luminosity was not considered within these populations , with the single luminosity of @xmath148 and @xmath149 for bl lacs and fsrqs , respectively .",
    "therefore , this is not a model of glf , but d07 rather considered various models of number density evolution , and the model parameters of the number density evolution are constrained by the redshift and flux distribution of egret blazars .",
    "they found that blazars can account for 12 - 19% of egrb at 1 gev , and their model predicts @xmath0 1000 blazars detectable by fermi , which is close to our result by a very different approach .",
    "kneiske & mannheim ( 2008 ; hereafter km08 ) considered the contribution to ebl from high energy cutoff bl lacs ( hbls ) .",
    "the spectrum was assumed to be a broken power - law with the peak energy around 1 tev for hbls .",
    "they employed the xlf of hbl which shows no evolution ( beckmann et al .",
    "2003 ) , and a statistical comparison with the egret blazar data was not made .",
    "they found that blazars can explain @xmath080% of egrb by including cascading emission ( see also  [ section : vhe ] ) .    for comparison",
    ", we show the seds of our model corresponding to the typical luminosities of bl lacs ( @xmath150 ) and fsrqs ( @xmath151 ) , as well as those used in previous studies , in fig .",
    "[ fig.sed_model ] .",
    "it should be noted that , in the studies that constrained the blazar glf parameters by a statistical comparison with the egret data , only cm98 , nt06 , and this work take into account the probability of identification of gamma - ray blazars by finding radio counterparts .",
    "cm98 assumed that there is no correlation between gamma - ray and radio luminosities of blazars .",
    "the assumption of no correlation at all over a wide range of gamma - ray and radio luminosities induces some inconsistencies ( see discussion in stecker & salamon 2001 ) , and it is physically reasonable to expect some level of correlation between the two from the viewpoint of the standard synchrotron and inverse compton emission model of blazars . in nt06 and this work",
    ", we introduced this correlation with a log - normal scatter in the gamma / radio flux ratio , which is consistent with the observation .",
    "km08 estimated that hbl would account for @xmath020% of the egrb by cascading emission produced by absorption of very high energy gamma - rays in igm . however , in our estimation the cascade emission would not significantly contribute to egrb ( see fig.[fig.cascade ] ) , and the reason for this discrepancy is as follows . in km08 , the minimum and maximum luminosities of hbl are set as l@xmath152 and l@xmath153 , respectively ( in @xmath35 at 0.3 tev ) .",
    "their sed model is a broken - power law , which is independent of luminosity and obtained from fitting to the tev observations of mkn421 , pks2005 - 489 , and pks2155 - 304 .",
    "however the luminosities of these three at 0.3 tev are about @xmath154 , which is relatively low in the range of hbl luminosity assumed by km08 .",
    "the use of the same sed up to l@xmath155 may overpredict the flux in very high energy band , compared with the case of the sed sequence .",
    "therefore we conclude that the contribution to egrb from the cascading component is not significant provided that the sed sequence is valid .",
    "it is well known that blazars show flaring activities .",
    "for example , tev cherenkov telescopes h.e.s.s . and",
    "magic have recently observed minute - scale variability in tev ranges ( aharonian et  al .",
    "2007 ; albert et  al .",
    "the origin of such variability has been discussed in many papers ( begelman et al .",
    "2008 ; ghisellini & tavecchio 2008a ; ghisellini et al . 2008",
    "; katarzyski et al . 2008 ; mastichiadis & moraitis 2008 ; giannios et al . 2009 ) , but it is still rather uncertain . therefore it is difficult to model the flaring activity quantitatively and incorporate in our analysis .",
    "we used the time - averaged gamma - ray flux of blazars in the third egret catalog , which is the mean of several viewing periods during the total egret observation period ( see  2.1 of nt06 for more details ) .",
    "typical duration of one viewing period is 23 weeks , and flaring activities within this scale have already been taken into account .",
    "flaring activities that might have happened at epochs out of the viewing periods are not taken into account , but still the flaring effect should have been incorporated to some extent by the use of time averaged flux .",
    "more observational information about blazar flares ( light curves and frequency , etc . )",
    "is required to examine this issue in more detail , and future fermi data will be useful .",
    "in this paper , we constructed a new model of the blazar gamma - ray luminosity function ( glf ) , taking into account the blazar sed sequence and the ldde luminosity function inferred from x - ray observations of agns .",
    "an implicit assumption here is that the jet activity of agns is associated with the accretion activity , and hence the blazar luminosity function has a similar evolution to that of x - ray agns .",
    "the glf model parameters are constrained by carefully fitting to the observed flux and redshift distribution of the egret blazars . by this model , for the first time",
    ", we can predict the spectrum of the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egrb ) in a non - trivial way , rather than assuming a simple functional form such as power - law spectra .",
    "the absorption of gamma - rays in igm by interaction with the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) , and the reprocessed cascade emission from electrons / positrons produced in igm are also taken into account in the egrb calculation .",
    "we found that , provided that the blazar sed sequence is valid , the amount of egrb energy flux absorbed by cib interaction ( at photon energy @xmath2 10 gev ) is not large and the egrb spectrum at lower photon energy bands is not significantly affected by the secondary cascade emission .",
    "the contribution from non - blazar agns to egrb is also considered , by using the nonthermal coronal electron model of inoue et al .",
    "this model is a natural extension of the standard x - ray spectral model of agn emission from the disk and corona region , and predicts the nonthermal emission extending from mev to higher energy band with a steep power - law .",
    "this model gives a natural explanation for the observed cosmic mev background , and we examined whether x - ray to gev gamma - ray background radiation can be accounted for by the two population model including blazars and non - blazar agns .",
    "our model predicts that the egrb flux from blazars at 100 mev is only about 45 % of the observed egrb flux of strong et al .",
    "( 2004a ) . however , it is possible to account for more than 80% of the observed egrb flux by the sum of blazars and non - blazar agns .",
    "the predicted spectrum is also in good agreement with the observed data from x - ray to @xmath01 gev , indicating that the egrb below 1 gev can mostly be explained by our two population model .",
    "the two components have a comparable contribution to egrb at @xmath0100 mev , and the blazar component is dominant at the higher energy range while the non - blazar component at the lower .",
    "therefore , the higher egrb flux at 100 mev found by this work than many of previous studies is not by change in the egrb flux from blazars , but by adding non - blazar agns .",
    "the egrb spectrum of strong et al .",
    "( 2004a ) shows a hump beyond 3 gev , which can not be explained by our model .",
    "the egrb flux determined originally by the egret team ( sreekumar et al .",
    "1998 ) is higher than our model , and the observed spectrum is harder .",
    "however , measurements of egrb suffer from the uncertainties in the theoretical modeling of the foreground diffuse galactic emission , and perhaps from systematic errors in the calibration of the egret detector above 1 gev ( stecker et al .",
    "we must await the _ fermi _ data to examine these issues and whether an additional , completely different source is necessary to explain all of egrb .",
    "we conclude that most ( at least more than 50% ) , and probably all , of the observed high - energy background radiation from x - ray to 1 gev spanning 6 orders of magnitude in photon energy can be accounted for by agns including blazars .",
    "we predicted the flux distribution of blazars by our model , and we found that 6001200 blazars in all sky should be detected by _",
    "fermi _ , assuming a sensitivity limit of @xmath156 photons @xmath7 s@xmath8 above 100 mev .",
    "this number is significantly lower than the predictions by many of the previous studies .",
    "the expected number of the non - blazar agns at 100 mev band is much smaller than unity in all sky at the egret sensitivity , but about 130 of such population are expected be detected by _",
    "fermi_. _ fermi _ should resolve almost all of the egrb flux from blazars into discrete blazars , with percentages of @xmath299% . on the other hand , less than 0.1% of the egrb flux from non - blazar agns can be resolved into discrete sources .",
    "therefore , we have a clear prediction : _ fermi _ will resolve almost all of the egrb flux into discrete sources at photon energies @xmath157 gev where blazars are dominant , while a significant fraction of the egrb flux will remain unresolved in the low energy band of @xmath3 100 mev where non - blazar agns have a significant contribution .",
    "this prediction can easily be tested , only with the source counts and the egrb estimates by _ fermi _ data .",
    "we also predicted the redshift and absolute luminosity distributions for the _ fermi _ blazars .",
    "data set with measured redshifts will enable us to get a quantitative measurement of the blazar glf and its evolution with a much larger statistics than egret .",
    "a direct comparison between blazar glf and x - ray agn lf could be done , making it possible to discuss the relation between the cosmic histories of jet activity and accretion activity of agns .",
    "our model will be able to serve as a guide in such studies .",
    "for example , if the jet luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate , we expect a larger jet / disk ratio than assumed in this work for agns with low eddington ratio , because x - ray luminosity scales as @xmath158 in the riaf regime .",
    "then , we may expect a different behavior of blazar glf from that of agn xlf at faint luminosity range .",
    "such an evidence is already seen from our fit to the egret data ( see fig . [ egret_dist ] ) , and it will be tested more quantitatively by the _",
