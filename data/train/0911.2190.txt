    "much work has been devoted to special relativistic effects of plasmas shukla1986 , largely stimulated by the rapid progress in high power laser technology @xcite .",
    "several studies of plasmas in a general relativistic context have also been made , see .e.g .",
    "@xcite , considering for example plasmas in strongly curved space - times close to pulsars @xcite , multi - fluid plasma effects in general relativity @xcite , dynamo effects in strong gravity @xcite , the effect of two - temperature systems on scalar perturbations @xcite , viscous heating of accretion discs due to gravitational wave dissipation @xcite , or considering gravitational wave ( gw ) propagation in a plasma medium , in particular nonlinear interactions in e.g. dusty plasmas @xcite or mhd plasmas @xcite .",
    "gw : s are currently opening up a promising new window for astronomy and astrophysics , e.g. astroseismology @xcite , and the interaction between gw : s and electromagnetic fields have been proposed as a possible means to detect gw : s @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear interaction of a curved spacetime with and electromagnetic field can yield a multitude of interesting astrophysical and cosmological effects @xcite . in a magnetized plasma ,",
    "a basic effect is the linear coupling between electromagnetic ( em ) waves and gw : s that occurs for propagation across a static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this linear mechanism leads to the excitation of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a plasma @xcite .",
    "naturally linear coupling mechanisms is not sufficient if one is interested in the possibility of converting gw energy to frequencies different from that of the original source .",
    "numerous examples of such mechanisms exists in plasmas , involving e.g. frequency up - conversion due to nonlinear wave steepening @xcite , or various three - wave couplings between gws and electromagnetic waves , e.g. @xcite .",
    "wave coupling mechanisms involving gws are studied for several different reasons . in some cases ,",
    "the emphasis is on the basic theory @xcite . in other works ,",
    "the focus is on gw detectors @xcite , on cosmology @xcite , or on astrophysical applications such as binary mergers @xcite , gamma ray bursts @xcite , pulsars @xcite or supernovas @xcite .    in the present paper we will re -",
    "consider the problem of three - wave interacting between electrostatic ( es ) , electromagnetic ( em ) and gw : s in a plasma , using a collisionfree kinetic description , i.e. the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous authors we will use a tetrad formalism @xcite , rather than a coordinate frame formalism , since the former formalism has been shown to significantly reduce the algebraic complexity .",
    "in particular , the coordinate frame formalism applied on the present problem produced very cumbersome algebraic expressions for the coupling coefficients @xcite , and as a result it was impossible to see if the growth rates for parametric processes where positive in general ( when damping was omitted ) , which is related to the fulfillment of the so called manley - rowe relations @xcite .",
    "the coefficients derived using the present tetrad formalism is shown to agree with previous works in the limit of a cold plasma @xcite .",
    "for the case of a finite temperature , the coefficients found from the present formalism are algebraically much simpler than previous results .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the previously computed coefficients , a comparison can not be easily made for the general case .",
    "finally , in the present paper we also include the back - reaction on the gw , in contrast to previous works .",
    "this allows us to discuss the energy conservation properties , and an energy conservation law is presented in the low temperature limit .",
    "we consider the interaction between weak gravitational waves and a collisionless plasma in an external magnetic field . since we consider nonempty space the background space - time is necessarily curved .",
    "however , if the wavelength of the gravitational waves and the interaction region is small relative to the background curvature we may take the background to be flat and static ( the lowest order version of the high - frequency approximation ) , and consider the perturbed energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the _ perturbations _ of the electromagnetic and material fields .    for simplicity",
    ", the unperturbed plasma is assumed to be static , isotropic and homogeneous . linearized , the einstein field equations ( efe ) take the form @xmath0   \\label{efe}\\]]provided the gauge condition @xmath1 is fulfilled , which is equivalent to state that only tensorial perturbations are present . here",
    "@xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 is the small deviation from the minkowski background metric , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the part of the energy - momentum tensor containing small electromagnetic and material field perturbations associated with the gravitational waves and @xmath7 @xmath8 . in the following it",
    "is understood that we neglect contributions of second order and higher in @xmath3 . in our notations @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the metric has the signature @xmath11 .    in vacuum , a linearized gravitational wave can be transformed into the transverse and traceless ( tt ) gauge .",
    "then we have the following line - element and corresponding orthonormal frame basis @xmath12@xmath13where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "as it turns out , the gravitational waves takes this form also in the particular case ( propagation in an isotropic plasma ) that we are considering .",
    "the difference to the vacuum case will be that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the phase velocity of the gravitational wave .",
    "note , however that the theory will be limited to the case @xmath18 , due to the omittance of back - ground curvature effects . from now on we will refer to tetrad components rather than coordinate components .",
    "we follow the covariant approach presented in @xcite ] for splitting the electromagnetic and material fields in a @xmath19 fashion .",

    "( [ divb ] ) and ( dive ) is valid only within the given approximation , as can be seen from e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ] , where source terms that are fully nonlinear in the gw - amplitude are included .",
    "in addition to the explicit source terms in ( je - source)-([jb - source ] ) , naturally the gravitational effects that is associated with the tetrad ( [ tetrad-1])-([tetrad2 ] ) must also be kept in mind .",
    "next we turn our attention to the particle description .",
    "the equation of motion for a particle of mass @xmath34 and charge @xmath35 in an electromagnetic and gravitational wave field is @xmath36 -\\mathbf{g }   \\label{eqmot}\\]]where @xmath37 and the four - momenta is @xmath38 . the gravitational force like term @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the ricci rotation coefficients , becomes @xmath41   \\label{g1 } \\\\",

    "next we apply kinetic plasma theory , representing each particle species by a distribution function @xmath43 governed by the vlasov equation . in tetrad form",
    "the vlasov equation reads @xcite ] @xmath44where the liouville operator is @xmath45 \\partial _ { p^{i}}\\]]and the electromagnetic force responsible for geodesic deviation is @xmath46 . in vector notation",
    "the vlasov equation reads @xmath47 \\cdot \\nabla _ { \\mathbf{p}}f=0   \\label{vlasov - vec}\\]]where @xmath48 . in the absence of gravitational waves , the vlasov equation has the following spatially homogeneous ( thermodynamical ) equilibrium solution , the synge - jttner distribution , e.g. @xcite , @xmath49where @xmath50 is the spatial particle number density , @xmath51",
    ", @xmath52 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath53 the temperature and @xmath54 is a modified bessel function of second kind .",
    "next we let all quantities consist of a superposition of three waves of different kinds .",
    "firstly we have a gravitational wave ( frequency and wavevector @xmath55 ) , next an electromagnetic wave @xmath56 , and finally an electrostatic wave ( langmuir wave ) @xmath57 .",
    "since we are dealing with high - frequency waves , the mass and charge will in what follows refer to electrons .",
    "the three waves are assumed to obey the following matching conditions@xmath58and    @xmath59    since there is no external magnetic field within our model , the gravitational wave does not induce an electric field at the frequency and wavevector @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , the metric perturbations at the combinations @xmath61 can be neglected , as a consequence of the high - frequency approximation .    as a prerequisite to the nonlinear calculations we first consider linear theory . linearizing the vlasov equation , in the absence of em - fields , the perturbed distribution function of the gw",
    "is given by .",
    "@xmath62where we have introduced the notation @xmath63 . noting that the different gw - polarizations obey @xmath64and@xmath65we deduce the same dispersion relation for both gw - polarizations , namely@xmath66where we here and from now on use the normalization @xmath67 of the unperturbed distribution . in the high - frequency approximation ,",
    "the last term of ( [ dr - gw ] ) is a small correction , comparable to the contribution from the background curvature @xcite ] , and thus we may use the the approximation @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , from the linearized vlasov equation ( without gravitational fields ) , together with maxwell s equations we deduce the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves@xmath69and for electrostatic waves@xmath70where @xmath71 is the electron plasma frequency .",
    "when nonlinear interactions are taken into account , the wave amplitudes will be time - dependent .",
    "we note that as far as the linear terms are concerned the only modification needed is the simple substitution @xmath72 @xmath73 , where the tilde denotes the weakly time - dependent amplitude , and similarly for the other waves @xcite ] .",
    "next , for definiteness , we assume the wave - vectors to span the plane perpendicular to @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , we note that for symmetry reasons , the @xmath75-polarization in this geometry couples to the em - wave polarized with the electric field along @xmath74 ( nonlinearly combined with the electrostatic wave ) , whereas the @xmath76-polarization couples to the em - waves with magnetic field along @xmath74 .",
    "these two cases are similar , and from now on we limit ourselves to the former choice of polarization . the amplitude evolution for @xmath77 is found by keeping resonant terms proportional to both the em and electrostatic wave in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "next we use eq .",
    "( [ hx-1 ] ) , generalized to keep the nonlinear terms and a weakly time - dependent amplitude . substituting the expression for @xmath78 from the vlasov equation , but now with second order nonlinear terms included , we obtain @xmath79where the coupling coefficient @xmath80 is @xmath81 \\frac{\\partial f_{sj}}{\\partial \\left\\vert p\\right\\vert ^{2}}+4\\mathbf{p}\\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{es}}\\frac{\\partial ^{2}f_{sj}}{\\partial ( \\left\\vert p\\right\\vert ^{2})^{2}}\\right\\ } d^{3}p.\\right ]    \\label{coefficient1}\\end{aligned}\\]]to find the em - wave evolution , we now include all resonant nonlinear source terms for the em - wave ( effective gravitational currents , nonlinear terms involving the gravitational force , and nonlinearities coming directly from the tetrad ) , and solve for @xmath82 , in which case we obtain @xmath83where @xmath84finally the calculation is completed by doing analog calculation for the electrostatic wave evolution , and the result is @xmath85where@xmath86 & & \\left.\\left.\\quad   - \\frac { \\left ( \\omega _ { \\mathrm{g}}- { p_{3}k_{\\mathrm{g}}}/{\\gamma m_{e}}\\right ) \\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{es}}\\cdot \\mathbf{e}_{1}+ ( { 2p_{1}}/{\\gamma m_{e}})\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{es}}\\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{g } } } { \\hat{\\omega}_{\\mathrm{em}}\\hat{\\omega}_{\\mathrm{es}}}\\right ) \\frac{\\partial f_{sj}}{\\partial |p|^{2}}d^{3}p\\right ]    \\label{coefficient-3}\\end{aligned}\\]]the coupling coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( although not @xmath80 ) has been calculated in ref .",

    "as can be seen the previously computed coefficients are algebraically much more complicated , and thus a comparison is difficult in general . for the special case where",
    "the temperature of @xmath89 approaches zero , the coefficients simplify a lot , and we obtain@xmath90which agrees with ref .",
    "furthermore , we find that in our case that also the gravitational case coefficient is similar , and we can define the common coupling coefficient @xmath91 . as a result of the agreement of the coefficients , the energy change of each of the waves in the cold limit can be written@xmath92and @xmath93where",
    "the energy density of each wave is @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 and@xmath97where @xmath98 denotes complex conjugate .",
    "the equations ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) together with ( [ freq - energy ] ) thus shows that the three - wave interaction process conserves the total wave - energy .",
    "in the present paper we have reconsidered the process of three - wave interaction between gravitational- , electromagnetic- and electrostatic waves in a collisionfree plasma . using an ortonormal tetrad description ,",
    "the algebraic complexity of the coupling coefficients is much reduced , as compared to previous authors @xcite ] .",
    "two of the coupling coefficients ( for the electrostatic and the electromagnetic wave ) can be shown to agree with previous results in the cold limit .",
    "the third coefficient ( for the gw ) has not been calculated before .",
    "inclusion of the back - reaction on the gw makes it possible to deduce and energy conservation law ( eqs ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) together with ( [ freq - energy ] ) ) in the cold limit .",
    "the energy conservation law is a natural consequence of the manley - rowe relations @xcite ] , which makes the same coefficient appear in all three coupled equations ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xmath91 . ) .",
    "however , this relation was only verified in the cold limit .",
    "although the present coefficients were not extremely complicated , it has proved to be difficult to deduce whether the coupling coefficients are symmetric ( i.e. fulfilling the manley - rowe relations ) , for the general case of a finite temperature .",
    "an interesting question , that remains for future research , is thus to decide whether this is due to some principal lack of a canonical hamiltonian structure ( that is the basic source of symmetric coupling coefficients , see e.g. @xcite ] ) of the einstein - maxwell - vlasov system , or if the difficulties are merely due to the algebraical complexity .",
