    "the high spatial resolution of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has allowed astronomers to study the photometric structure of galactic nuclei with unprecedented detail .",
    "most studies have focused on early - type galaxies and bulges , and many systems have now been imaged ( e.g. , crane et al .  1993 ; jaffe et al .  1994 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; forbes , franx & illingworth 1995 ; carollo et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter c97 ) .",
    "the main result is that at the @xmath22 resolution limit of hst , virtually all galaxies have power - law surface brightness cusps , @xmath7 , with @xmath23 and no observed transition to a homogeneous core .",
    "in addition , the surface brightness profiles fall in two categories : ` cores ' , which have a break at a resolved radius , with @xmath1 , and not to ( a galaxy with ) a homogeneous core , @xmath24 constant . ] and ` power - laws ' , which have no clear break ( faber et al .  1997 ; hereafter f97 ) .",
    "the former have @xmath25 , while the latter have @xmath2 .",
    "the nuclear properties correlate with luminosity : in general , galaxies with @xmath26 have core profiles , galaxies with @xmath4 have power - law profiles , and both profile types occur in galaxies with @xmath27 .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to provide a quantitative framework for understanding these observations through models with massive black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "black holes are believed to be responsible for the energetic processes in active galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , peterson 1997 ; fabian 1997 ) .",
    "many or most quiescent galaxies may have been active in the past , and may thus also contain bhs ( sotan 1982 ; chokshi & turner 1992 ) .",
    "it has been well documented theoretically that the presence of a bh in the center of a stellar system induces a power - law cusp in the mass distribution , @xmath28 at asymptotically small radii , with a corresponding cusp @xmath29 in the projected surface density ( at asymptotically small radii @xmath30 $ ] , but this need not be true at observationally accessible radii ; e.g. , gebhardt et al .",
    "1996 ) . with globular clusters in mind ,",
    "bahcall & wolf ( 1976 ) showed that @xmath31 for a system with a bh that has been present longer than the two - body relaxation time ( this holds for equal mass stars ; the results with a mass spectrum are more complicated , cf .",
    "bahcall & wolf 1977 ) . in galaxies",
    ", the two - body relaxation time typically exceeds the hubble time , even in the central regions ( rauch & tremaine 1997 ) .",
    "young ( 1980 ) inferred @xmath32 for the case of adiabatic bh growth ( i.e. , growth slow compared to the dynamical time ) in an isothermal sphere ( see also cipollina 1995 ) .",
    "quinlan , hernquist & sigurdsson ( 1995 ) showed that non - isothermal initial conditions may yield other values of @xmath33 .",
    "adiabatic bh growth in rotating models was studied by lee & goodman ( 1989 ) and cipollina & bertin ( 1994 ) .",
    "sigurdsson , hernquist & quinlan ( 1995 ) presented @xmath34-body calculations of bh growth , and discussed the relation between adiabatic invariance and the bh growth time .",
    "scenarios in which bhs appear non - adiabatically have also been addressed .",
    "stiavelli ( 1998 ) showed that galaxy formation by violent relaxation around a pre - existing bh yields @xmath32 , as in the models of young ( 1980 ) .",
    "accretion of an external bh can either weaken an existing cusp ( quinlan & hernquist 1997 ) or create a new cusp ( nakano & makino 1997 ) , depending on the assumed initial structure of the accreting galaxy .    observed power - law cusps need not necessarily be associated with bhs , for several reasons .",
    "first , one of the simplest stellar dynamical equilibrium systems is the singular isothermal sphere , which has @xmath35 and no bh ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "second , a power - law density cusp can easily be created in a stellar system through dissipational processes ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "third , cusps can form naturally without bhs even in absence of dissipation ; e.g. , dissipationless simulations of galaxy formation produce dark halos with @xmath36 near the center ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) .",
    "hence , the fact that all galaxies observed with hst have surface brightness cusps does not necessarily imply that all galaxies have bhs ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "we focus here on the simple models of adiabatic bh growth in a homogeneous isothermal core proposed by young ( 1980 ) .",
    "these models have been used to interpret hst photometry for two well - studied galaxies that also have kinematically determined bh masses , namely m87 and m32 . given that observed surface brightness cusps can be interpreted in so many ways , it is quite remarkable how successful the models have been for these two galaxies .",
    "the photometrically determined bh mass for m87 ( young et al .",
    "1978 ; lauer et al .",
    "1992a ) agrees within the errors to that determined kinematically ( harms et al .",
    "1994 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1997 ) , as is the case for m32 ( lauer et al .",
    "1992b ; van der marel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the success of young s models for individual galaxies justifies a more detailed investigation of their viability .",
    "we therefore study whether and how these models fit in with our general understanding of galactic nuclei , as characterized by four important observational findings : ( i ) surface brightness profiles have cusps ; ( ii ) cusp slopes correlate with luminosity ; ( iii ) nuclear properties of early - type galaxies obey scaling relations similar to those of the fundamental plane ( lauer 1985 ; kormendy 1985 ; f97 ) ; and ( iv ) kinematically determined bh masses in nearby galaxies tend to scale roughly with galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; ho 1998 ) .",
    "the key questions that these findings pose are : ( a ) is it possible that all surface brightness cusps observed with hst , those in core profiles as well as those in and power - law profiles , are due to adiabatic bh growth in homogeneous cores ? ; ( b ) can this scenario naturally explain the observed correlation between nuclear cusp slope and luminosity ? ; ( c ) are the properties of the required homogeneous ` progenitor ' cores plausible in view of the fundamental plane ? ; and ( d ) is the bh mass distribution thus implied by hst photometry consistent with that suggested by kinematical observations of nearby galaxies ?",
    "the main result of the present paper is that all four questions can be answered affirmatively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : models ] presents a general description and discussion of the models .",
    "section  [ s : trends ] combines the models with established scaling relations for early - type galaxies to obtain predictions for the nuclear photometric properties of these galaxies as function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "section  [ s : indifit ] presents model fits to hst photometry of 46 individual galaxies .",
    "section  [ s : conc ] summarizes and discusses the conclusions of the paper .",
    "some additional galaxies that did not pass the selection criteria of the main sample are discussed in appendix  [ s : appa ] .",
    "a hubble constant @xmath37 is used throughout this paper .",
    "this does not directly influence the data - model comparison , but does set the length , mass and luminosity scales in physical units . specifically ,",
    "distance , length and mass scale as @xmath38 , luminosity scales as @xmath39 , and mass - to - light ratio scales as @xmath40 .",
    "all quantities in this paper pertain to the photometric @xmath17-band .",
    "we study adiabatic bh growth in spherical models .",
    "the adiabaticity implies , by definition , that the orbital actions ( the radial action @xmath41 and the angular momentum @xmath42 ) are conserved ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the dependence of the phase - space distribution function on the actions is therefore identical before and after bh growth .",
    "however , the bh growth does change the gravitational potential , so the relation between the actions and the phase - space coordinates is different in the initial and the final models .",
    "an explicit expression for the phase - space distribution function @xmath43 of the final model , as function of the energy @xmath44 and the angular momentum @xmath42 , can be obtained with an iterative algorithm ( young 1980 ) .",
    "given a trial estimate for the mass density @xmath45 , an iteration step proceeds as follows : use poisson s equation to calculate the gravitational potential generated by @xmath45 , and add the contribution of the bh ; calculate the actions in this potential on a grid in @xmath46 space ; calculate the distribution function @xmath47 on the grid , using the fact that @xmath43 is the same function of the actions as in the ( pre - specified ) initial model ; calculate a new estimate for @xmath45 by integration of @xmath47 over velocity space .",
    "iteration proceeds until the mass - density has converged .",
    "projected model properties can be evaluated after convergence through straightforward numerical integration .",
    "this algorithm was implemented by , e.g. , quinlan et al .",
    "gerry quinlan kindly provided his software for use in this paper , and all models discussed here were calculated with this software .",
    "the assumption of adiabatic bh growth by itself is not very informative . in principle , any observed surface brightness profile is consistent with this assumption , for any arbitrary value of the assumed current bh mass .",
    "so to make progress one must assume some knowledge about the properties of the initial model .",
    "the analysis here is restricted to models in which the initial system is a ( non - singular ) isothermal sphere , as in young ( 1980 ) .",
    "the model predictions at large radii will not be used , so the only relevant assumption in the present context is that the initial system has a homogeneous isothermal core .",
    "young s models have been widely discussed in the literature , yield definite predictions , and have not previously been compared in detail to hst results for a large sample of galaxies .",
    "they are therefore the natural starting point for any investigation .",
    "in addition , stellar systems do in fact exist for which the central regions are well approximated by an isothermal sphere .",
    "globular clusters that have not undergone core collapse due to two - body relaxation are observed to have constant density isothermal cores ( e.g. , trager , king & djorgovski 1995 ) .",
    "this may indicate that isothermal cores are a natural attribute of any stellar system .",
    "the fact that constant density cores are not found in the centers of early - type galaxies may indicate merely that the density distribution in their nuclear regions has been altered by the presence of a bh , and it is exactly this proposition that will be tested by the present paper .",
    "young s models make two strong assumptions about the relation between bhs and galaxy formation .",
    "it is assumed that galaxies form and relax before bhs start to grow , and it is assumed that the subsequent bh growth is slow compared to the dynamical time .",
    "these assumptions provide a viable scenario ( e.g. , murphy , cohn & durisen 1991 ) , but are not unique .",
    "one alternative is that galaxy and bh formation occur rapidly and simultaneously ( e.g. , haehnelt & rees 1993 ) .",
    "interestingly , stiavelli ( 1998 ) recently showed that galaxy formation around a pre - existing bh , for a given bh mass , leads to a similar end - state as adiabatic growth in a pre - existing homogeneous core .",
    "this indicates that the predictions of young s models may have a larger range of applicability than strictly indicated by their underlying model assumptions . in particular :",
    "( i ) a good fit to the data with young s models does not necessarily imply that a bh indeed grew adiabatically , or that the galaxy ever had a homogeneous core ; and ( ii ) growth of bhs in galaxies before or during galaxy formation does not necessarily invalidate the predictions of young s models .",
    "we define the dimensionless bh mass @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a measure of the mass of the initial isothermal core , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the core radius and central density .",
    "the radius of the bh ` sphere of influence ' is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the velocity dispersion of the initial isothermal sphere ( @xmath54 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the shape of the projected intensity profile after bh growth , @xmath55 , depends only on @xmath56 ; the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath57 determine the radial and intensity scaling .",
    "figure  [ f : models ] shows @xmath55 for various values of @xmath56 .    before discussing the implications of the bh growth",
    ", it is worth pointing out a peculiar property of the isothermal sphere that is visible in figure  [ f : models ] .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the intensity profile decreases monotonically from zero at asymptotically small radii , to @xmath58 at @xmath59 ( indicated by a vertical dashed line in figure  [ f : models ] ) . here",
    "the intensity profile has an inflexion point .",
    "the logarithmic slope then _ increases _ with radius and has the value @xmath60 at asymptotically large radii . in real galaxies",
    "the intensity profile generally does not have an inflexion point , and the logarithmic slope is significantly steeper at large radii . in the remaining figures of this paper we replaced the model predictions at @xmath61 with a power - law of slope",
    "this was done for visual purposes only ; the actual data - model comparison will always be restricted to radii with @xmath62 . to model observed profiles at radii with @xmath61 would require initial conditions that better reproduce the observed behavior of real galaxies at large radii .",
    "this would certainly be useful , but we will argue in section  [ ss : fitresults ] that this will not change the main conclusions of this paper .    figure  [ f : models ] shows that the adiabatic bh growth yields the well - known asymptotic slope @xmath6 at small radii .",
    "however , this asymptotic behavior does not apply until at least @xmath63 .",
    "this region is generally inaccessible to observations .",
    "core radii do not often exceed @xmath64 ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : indifit ] below ) , for which the @xmath22 resolution limit of hst corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "the logarithmic intensity slope at this radius can either be smaller or larger than the asymptotic slope , depending on the value of @xmath56 .    to get a quantitative understanding of the observable properties of the models ,",
    "we have fitted the predicted intensity profiles in figure  [ f : models ] with the so - called ` nuker - law ' parameterization : @xmath66^{-{{\\beta-\\gamma}\\over\\alpha } } .",
    "\\label{nukerdef}\\ ] ] this parameterization has been used successfully to describe the nuclear intensity profiles of a large sample of galaxies ( byun et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter b96 ; f97 ) .",
    "the intensity is @xmath67 at small radii and @xmath68 at large radii , with the transition occurring at the break radius @xmath69 ; the parameter @xmath70 determines the sharpness of the break , and @xmath71 is the intensity at @xmath69 .",
    "the model predictions were fit over the radial range @xmath72 ( which is bracketed by the dashed vertical lines in figure  [ f : models ] ) , which is a typical range that may be observationally accessible .",
    "the fitted profiles are shown as dotted curves .",
    "the fit parameters are shown as function of @xmath56 in figure  [ f : nukpar ] .",
    "the most interesting parameter is @xmath8 , which measures the slope of the intensity profile at the smallest accessible radii .",
    "it increases monotonically with @xmath56 , from @xmath73 for @xmath74 to @xmath75 for @xmath76 ( the largest @xmath56 shown in figure  [ f : models ] ) .",
    "this spans the entire range of values observed with hst ( f97 ) .",
    "it may seem remarkable that the slope @xmath8 for large values of @xmath56 is _ steeper _ than the slope at asymptotically small radii .",
    "the reason for this is that for large values of @xmath56 the bh ` sphere of influence ' exceeds the initial core size .",
    "the bh then grows in the region where initially @xmath35 , which leads to a steeper intensity profile after bh growth ( quinlan et al .",
    "in fact , when larger values of @xmath56 are considered than those plotted in figures  [ f : models ] and  [ f : nukpar ] , the slope @xmath8 eventually even reaches values in excess of 2 .",
    "such models are probably less relevant for real galaxies though , which have @xmath77 .",
    "the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath71 of the nuker - law fit determine the radial and intensity scale of the model .",
    "they are of the same order as the scale parameters @xmath50 and @xmath57 of the initial isothermal sphere , but differ more from these scale parameters as @xmath56 grows larger .",
    "the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath78 of the nuker law determine the shape of the intensity profile at and outside the break radius .",
    "the models have @xmath79 , independent of @xmath56 , while @xmath70 varies between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , depending on @xmath56 .",
    "these results are not inconsistent with typical observed values ( f97 ; see also section  [ ss : fitresults ] below ) .",
    "the results presented in figure  [ f : nukpar ] show that young s models of adiabatic bh growth can in principle generate profiles with similar cusp slopes as observed in either core galaxies or power - law galaxies . in this section",
    "we address the question whether this does in fact occur for plausible bh masses , and whether there is a natural explanation for the observed correlation between cusp slope and luminosity .",
    "these questions are addressed in a general sense , using established scaling relations for early - type galaxies .",
    "detailed fits to individual galaxies are presented in section  [ s : indifit ] .",
    "early - type galaxies lie on a plane in the space of their four primary global characteristics , i.e. , the effective radius @xmath82 , the average projected intensity inside the effective radius @xmath83 , the velocity dispersion @xmath84 and the total luminosity @xmath42 ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) . for core galaxies ,",
    "this so - called fundamental plane has an analog in terms of nuclear properties ( lauer 1985 ; kormendy 1985 ) .",
    "the relevant quantities are now the break radius @xmath69 and break intensity @xmath71 , instead of @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in the present context",
    "we are interested in the dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath71 on luminosity . for the sample of f97 : @xmath85 where @xmath69 is in @xmath86 , @xmath71 is in the @xmath17-band and in units of @xmath87 , and @xmath42 is the total @xmath17-band luminosity in @xmath88 .",

    "the quantity @xmath98 is the @xmath17-band mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population , which transforms the observed projected light intensity ( @xmath99 ) to a projected surface mass density ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "combination of equations  ( [ rbibcorerel ] ) and  ( [ obstoinicorerel ] ) yields for the ` progenitors ' of core galaxies ( i.e. , before they grew bhs ) : @xmath101    power - law galaxies have no well - defined breaks , and hence @xmath69 and @xmath71 reduce to fit parameters with little physical significance . as a result",
    ", there is no analog to the relations  ( [ rbibcorerel ] ) between @xmath69 , @xmath71 and @xmath42 for power - law galaxies .",
    "the hypothesis that we will explore here is that both core galaxies and power - law galaxies evolved from progenitors with isothermal cores , and that the scale radius and density of the progenitor cores of both types of systems obeyed equations  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) .",
    "this scenario predicts for core galaxies and power - law galaxies of the same luminosity that : ( i ) differences in cusp slope must be due to differences in bh mass ; and ( ii ) there should be no differences in surface brightness at radii @xmath102 , where bhs do not have an impact .",
    "the latter prediction can be verified directly .",
    "figure  [ f : fiverzero ] shows as function of luminosity , for each of the galaxies in the sample of section  [ s : indifit ] , the observed @xmath17-band surface brightness at @xmath103 ; here @xmath104 is defined to be the progenitor core radius predicted by equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) .",
    "indeed , core galaxies and power - law galaxies of the same luminosity have the same surface brightness outside the nuclear region .",
    "this is partly a restatement of the fact that these galaxies also follow the same set of global fundamental plane relations .",
    "a bh in the center of a galaxy induces a @xmath105 cusp in the rotation velocity or velocity dispersion of a tracer population near the nucleus .",
    "high spatial resolution kinematical measurements can therefore yield accurate bh mass determinations for individual galaxies .",

    "the bh masses follow a roughly linear scaling relation between bh mass and galaxy luminosity . for disk galaxies",

    "we will use this relation here , although it remains unclear to what extent this relation may be influenced by selection bias . in particular , there may be a population of galaxies with lower bh masses that have to date remained undetected .",
    "complete samples of kinematically well - studied galaxies are required to test this .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios of early type galaxies have a shallow correlation with luminosity .",

    "the absolute magnitude in the @xmath17-band , @xmath113 , is related to the luminosity @xmath42 according to @xmath114 , so alternatively : @xmath115      equations  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) and  ( [ mulcor ] ) predict @xmath50 , @xmath100 and @xmath56 for any given luminosity @xmath42 .",

    "] so for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the profiles before and after bh growth ( dashed and solid curves , respectively ) are identical and both reflect the adopted initial model outside the core radius ( in this case a power law of logarithmic slope @xmath126 , see section  [ ss : predic ] ) . as the luminosity is increased , the initial core radius @xmath50 ( indicated by a dotted vertical line ) shifts into the observable range .",
    "the profiles inside @xmath50 have a power - law cusp , due to the bh . for @xmath127 and @xmath128 ,",
    "the transition from the outer power - law slope to the inner power - law cusp is shallow enough that these profiles would still be classified in the f97 scheme as power - law profiles , not core profiles .",
    "however , the dimensionless bh mass @xmath56 , and therefore also the power - law cusp slope @xmath8 ( cf .  figure  [ f : nukpar ] ) , decreases with luminosity , whereas @xmath50 increases with luminosity . these effects combine to produce a pronounced break in the profiles for @xmath129 and @xmath118 , leading them to be classified as core profiles .",
    "figure  [ f : virgoprof ] therefore shows that the models naturally predict a transition from power - law profiles to core profiles with increasing luminosity , as seen in hst observations .",
    "for a more quantitative assessment of the model predictions we have fitted nuker - law parameterizations to the profiles predicted for various absolute magnitudes .",

    "the model predictions presented here are remarkably consistent with these observations .",
    "the heavy solid curves in figure  [ f : virgonuk ] show that models with the standard bh masses of equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) predict that galaxies at the distance of virgo fainter than @xmath132 are power - law galaxies , and that galaxies brighter than @xmath132 are core galaxies .",
    "both the sense and the absolute magnitude of the predicted transition are the same as observed !",
    "the bh masses of galaxies are likely to have an intrinsic scatter , and this naturally explains the observed existence of both power - law galaxies and core galaxies in the region around the transition magnitude .",
    "both the absence of core galaxies at sufficiently faint luminosities and the absence of power - law galaxies at sufficiently bright luminosities is generically reproduced by the models . however , to reproduce that the cut - offs occur at @xmath128 and @xmath133 requires a certain amount of fine - tuning .",
    "it is reproduced if there are no galaxies at @xmath4 with bh masses smaller than @xmath134 times those given by equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) , and if there are no galaxies at @xmath3 with bh masses larger than @xmath135 times those given by equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) . a situation",
    "in which this may occur naturally is if the relation between @xmath136 and @xmath137 actually has a somewhat shallower slope than suggested by equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) .",
    "the slope in equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) itself is not ruled out , but the cutoffs at @xmath128 and @xmath138 are then somewhat surprising given that bh masses inferred from kinematical observations of nearby galaxies have a rms scatter around equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) of a factor @xmath139 .",
    "such a scatter would lead one to expect to find some power - law galaxies at @xmath3 and some core galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "instead , the f97 sample contains none of the former ; it contains two of the latter ( m31 and ngc 4486b ) , but these are both rather atypical ( among other things , both have a double nucleus ; lauer et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "possibly , larger samples will shed more light on the rigidity of the observed cutoffs at @xmath140 and @xmath133 .",
    "observations indicate not only that the cusp slopes of early - type galaxies correlate with luminosity , but also that the distribution of cusp slopes is bimodal ( gebhardt et al .  1996 ; f97 ; but see merritt 1997 for an alternative view ) .",
    "the primary evidence for this is a lack of galaxies with @xmath141 .",
    "observed core galaxies have @xmath95 and observed power - law galaxies have @xmath142 .",
    "this can not be explained with the present scenario if all galaxies have the same @xmath16 given by equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) , which predicts that galaxies with @xmath143 produce cusp slopes @xmath144 ( cf .  figure  [ f : virgonuk ] ) .",
    "hence , a bimodal distribution in @xmath16 is required to reproduce the observed bimodality in @xmath8 .",
    "for example , assume that there are two populations of galaxies in the luminosity range @xmath27 where core and power - law galaxies overlap : galaxies that have three times smaller bh masses than suggested by equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) , and galaxies that have three times larger bh masses than suggested by this equation .",
    "figure  [ f : virgonuk ] shows that the former galaxies will all be core galaxies with @xmath145 and that the latter will all be power - law galaxies with @xmath146 , reproducing the observed bimodality .",
    "evidence has been mounting in recent years that there are two types of elliptical galaxies : luminous ellipticals with boxy isophotes that are pressure supported by an anisotropic velocity distribution , and small ellipticals with disky isophotes that are flattened by rotation .",
    "kormendy & bender ( 1996 ) suggested a formal subdivision of the hubble sequence based on these criteria .",
    "f97 found an almost perfect correspondence between this bimodality in the global properties of elliptical galaxies and the bimodality in the nuclear cusp slopes .",
    "galaxies with disky isophotes have power - law profiles and galaxies with boxy isophotes have core profiles .",
    "the scenario presented here explains this as a result of higher values of @xmath16 in disky galaxies than in boxy galaxies .",
    "the number of galaxies with kinematically determined bh masses is too small at present to either confirm or rule out this hypothesis directly .",
    "however , the observed bimodality in both the global and nuclear properties of elliptical galaxies implies that a bimodal distribution of @xmath16 may not be unnatural .",
    "the formation of disky galaxies is believed to be characterized by dissipation , either during galaxy formation or at the time of the last major merger .",
    "this suggests the presence of large amounts of gas , a significant fraction of which may have been used to form or feed a bh .",
    "this provides a plausible reason why @xmath16 would be larger in disky galaxies than in boxy galaxies .",
    "the results of section  [ s : trends ] show that the scenario of adiabatic bh growth combined with established scaling relations reproduces the generic nuclear photometric properties of early - type galaxies .",
    "however , in any sample of real galaxies one should expect an intrinsic scatter in the relevant model parameters , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath11 , as well as in distance .",
    "so to further address the plausibility of the proposed scenario we proceed by analyzing the surface brightness profiles of individual galaxies .",
    "the heart of the sample studied here is the f97 sample , which is itself a collection of galaxies from various sources , including lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , jaffe et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and various wfpc / gto programs . to the f97 sample we added those galaxies in b96 and c97 that are not already contained in the f97 sample . from the combined sample we removed the few galaxies that are not classified as an early type ( e , e / s0 or s0 ) in the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "we removed two more galaxies for which only the profile classification is available ( core or power - law ) , without further information on the surface brightness profile .",
    "the resulting sample has 71 galaxies , and contains the majority of the nearby early - type galaxies that have been imaged to date with hst .",
    "bhs with plausible masses do not influence the surface brightness profile at radii @xmath147 , cf .",
    "sections  [ s : models ] and  [ s : trends ] .",
    "so to obtain meaningful information for a given galaxy , there must be at least a small radial range @xmath148 for which the surface brightness profile is not degraded by the @xmath149 resolution of hst .",
    "we therefore removed all galaxies from the sample with @xmath150 , where as before @xmath104 is for each galaxy defined to be the progenitor core radius predicted by equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) .",

    "the remaining sample contains 46 galaxies .",
    "basic properties are listed in tables  [ t : samplec ] and  [ t : samplepl ] , for core and power - law galaxies , respectively .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of early - type galaxies are well fit by the nuker - law parameterization given in equation  ( [ nukerdef ] ) , over the radial range @xmath154 .",
    "the typical rms error of a fit is @xmath155 mag ( b96 ) .",
    "heavy solid curves in figures  [ f : indigalsc ] and  [ f : indigalspl ] show the nuker laws that best fit the data for all core and power - law galaxies in the sample , respectively .",
    "the literature sources of the nuker - law parameters are listed in tables  [ t : samplec ] and  [ t : samplepl ] .",
    "c97 present both @xmath17-band and @xmath156-band data , but we used only the @xmath17-band data from their study for consistency with f97 and b96 ( which present only @xmath17-band data ) . for galaxies contained in the samples of both f97 and c97 we used only the f97 data ( but the c97 data yield similar results , see below ) .",
    "the brightness profiles in the figures are shown as function of the mean radius @xmath157 , where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of an elliptical isophote .",
    "this choice is most appropriate for comparison to the predictions of our spherical models .",
    "we chose to fit the adiabatic bh growth models to the best - fitting nuker - law parameterizations , rather than to the actual surface brightness data points .",
    "this not only has the advantage of simplicity , but also allows galaxies to be included in the study for which the best - fitting nuker - law parameters have been published , but not the actual surface brightness data points .",
    "the accuracy to be gained by fitting the actual data points is only very modest , given how well the data are described by a nuker law .",
    "this was verified explicitly for the case of m87 , for which the bh mass inferred by fitting to the data directly differs by only @xmath160 dex from the bh mass inferred by fitting to the nuker law parameterization .",
    "the non - hatched regions in the panels of figures  [ f : indigalsc ] and  [ f : indigalspl ] indicate for each galaxy the region over which the models were fit to the data .",
    "this region always excludes radii @xmath161 , which are degraded by the hst point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "it also excludes radii with @xmath162 , for which the surface brightness profile is not expected to be influenced by the possible presence of a bh ( cf .",
    "sections  [ s : models ] and  [ s : trends ] ) .",
    "so at these radii one would merely be comparing the initial model to the data , which is meaningless , because no effort was made to find an initial model that accurately represents the large radii behavior of real galaxies .",
    "the fit region was never allowed to extend beyond @xmath163 ; the hst data do not typically extend this far , and the nuker - law description of the data breaks down at these radii .",
    "the adiabatic bh growth models have three free parameters : @xmath50 , which sets the radial scale ; @xmath164 , which sets the intensity scale ; and @xmath56 , which determines the bh mass .",
    "the brightness profiles for core galaxies have three well - determined characteristic quantities : @xmath165 , the radius at which a break occurs ; @xmath99 , the intensity at that radius ; and @xmath8 , the inner cusp slope . for core galaxies",
    "it is therefore possible to infer a unique best - fitting value for each model parameter .",
    "by contrast , the brightness profiles of power - law galaxies have no clear break and no characteristic scale radius .",
    "this yields a degeneracy in the modeling , in the sense that models with different @xmath50 and @xmath11 can provide very similar fits to the data . to break this degeneracy",
    ", we assume for power - law galaxies that @xmath50 is known a priori , and we fix it to the value @xmath104 predicted by equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) .",
    "so for power - law galaxies we merely determine the @xmath11 values implied by the hypothesis that power - law galaxies had progenitor cores that obeyed the same scaling relations as core galaxies , while for core galaxies we actually determine both @xmath50 and @xmath11 from the data without further assumptions .",
    "a fit to an observed brightness profile yields only the ratio @xmath166 , not the bh mass @xmath11 itself . to obtain",
    "the latter requires knowledge of the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath98 , which can only be determined from kinematical data .",
    "where available , @xmath98 was used from m98 . for those galaxies not in their sample , @xmath98 was estimated from equation  ( [ upscor ] ) .",
    "five galaxies in the f97 sample are also contained in the c97 sample .",
    "this allows a direct estimate to be obtained of the typical formal errors in the model parameters ( which , by definition , are the rms differences among model parameters determined from independent data sets ) .",
    "this is important , because our approach of fitting to nuker laws rather than to data points precludes use of the normal statistical procedures .",
    "for the five galaxies in common to the f97 and c97 samples , the rms difference in the inferred @xmath136 values is @xmath167 dex .",
    "this includes the combined random errors from both photon noise and image deconvolution , because f97 used lucy deconvolved images obtained with the first wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc1 ) , while c97 used images obtained with the second wide field and planetary camera ( which has internal optics to correct for the spherical aberration of the hst primary mirror ) .",
    "some of the sample galaxies have minor or patchy dust obscuration .",
    "this should have little effect on the inferred bh masses , because the literature sources from which we took the nuker law parameterizations always excluded or corrected for dust regions where necessary .",
    "there are no galaxies in the sample with extreme dust absorption across the nucleus , such as ngc 4261 ( ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ) or ngc",
    "7052 ( van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ) , because f97 rejected such galaxies from their sample .",
    "the effects of additional photometric components in the sample galaxies is more difficult to assess .",
    "out of 16 power - law galaxies in the sample , 4 galaxies have a nuclear stellar cluster and 9 galaxies have a nuclear stellar disk .",
    "such components are not common in core galaxies .",
    "nuclear stellar clusters were always excluded from the fit by the literature sources from which we took the nuker law parameterizations , and they should therefore not bias the bh masses inferred here .",
    "however , this remains somewhat speculative as long as the relation between the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster and a possible bh is unknown .",
    "by contrast , none of the literature sources from which we took the nuker law parameterizations corrected for or subtracted nuclear stellar disks .",
    "it is not clear whether this would in fact be desirable , but it is certainly useful to know how sensitive the inferred bh mass is to the presence of a stellar disk .",
    "the galaxy ngc 4570 has nuclear stellar disk ( van den bosch , jaffe & van der marel 1998 ; van den bosch & emsellem 1998 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) , and provides a useful test case in this context .",
    "f97 presented the overall best - fitting nuker law for this galaxy , while scorza & van den bosch ( 1998 ) performed a disk - bulge decomposition and presented only the best - fitting nuker law to the bulge component .",
    "when modeled with the scenario presented here , the bh masses implied by the nuker law fits of f97 and scorza & van den bosch differ by @xmath168 dex .",
    "this is consistent with the arguments presented in both papers that nuclear stellar disks are not the cause of the steep cusps in power - law galaxies , and suggests that nuclear stellar disks are not a major source of uncertainty in the bh masses inferred here for power - law galaxies .",
    "so the overall uncertainty in the inferred bh masses due to photon noise , psf deconvolution , dust , nuclear stellar clusters and nuclear stellar disks is @xmath169@xmath170 dex .",
    "tables  [ t : samplec ] and  [ t : samplepl ] show that the models invoke a bh to fit the data for all galaxies , and this small error estimate suggests that these detections are highly significant ( given the model assumptions ) .",
    "one may nonetheless wonder whether there are some galaxies in our sample for which the models may also be consistent with the data for @xmath171 .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied non - parametric deprojections of the surface brightness profiles of a large sample of early - type galaxies observed with hst .",
    "a total of 24 galaxies from our sample of 46 are included in their sample . in only two of these galaxies ( ngc 1600 and ngc 4889 )",
    "can the existence of an isothermal core not be excluded at the @xmath172 resolution limit of hst .",
    "if these statistics are representative for our sample as a whole , then we may expect that the models could be consistent with @xmath173 for @xmath139 galaxies in our sample of 46 .",
    "this is small enough not to influence the conclusions in the following sections on the overall properties of the sample .",
    "dashed curves in figures  [ f : indigalsc ] and  [ f : indigalspl ] show the best model fits to the data for all galaxies .",

    "figure  [ f : indigalsc ] shows the core galaxies in the sample .",
    "the brightness profiles for these galaxies are generally well fit by the models ; the average rms residual is only @xmath174 mag / arcsec@xmath175 . in some galaxies ,",
    "the models fit the data even outside the region where the fit was performed ( the hatched region ) ; examples are a1020 , ngc 720 , and ic 1459 .",
    "however , this is not generally true , as witnessed by , e.g. , a2052 , ngc 524 and ngc 4168 .",
    "this is because outside the break radius @xmath69 , real galaxies show a larger variety of properties than the models .",
    "the nuker - law parameter @xmath78 measures the intensity profile slope outside @xmath69 , and @xmath70 determines the sharpness of the break .",
    "the core galaxies in the sample have rather broad distributions of @xmath70 and @xmath78 .",
    "the 16% and 84% percentiles for @xmath70 are @xmath176 and @xmath177 ; for @xmath78 they are @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",

    "this is because outside @xmath69 they always resemble the isothermal sphere . with more general initial conditions it should be possible to fit the observed profiles of core galaxies also outside the break radius @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , one could study initial conditions with homogeneous cores but a larger variety of outer profile properties .",
    "we have not explored this , because the resulting bh masses would probably not be very different .",
    "the properties of the initial model at @xmath147 have little influence on the predicted distribution after bh growth at @xmath148 , unless the size @xmath182 of the bh sphere of influence actually extends significantly into the region @xmath183 .",
    "this is not the case , since @xmath184 , and @xmath185 for the large majority of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "figure  [ f : indigalspl ] shows the power - law galaxies in the sample .",
    "the fits for these galaxies are somewhat poorer than for the core galaxies , due in part to the fact that @xmath50 was fixed a priori ( so that one less free parameter is available to optimize the fit ) .",
    "the average rms residual is @xmath186 mag / arcsec@xmath175 .",
    "the mismatch is typically in the sense that the predicted profiles have slightly more curvature than the observed profiles .",
    "however , the fits are still reasonable , given the simple nature of the models .",
    "there are a few galaxies for which the fit is acceptable even outside the fit - region , e.g. , ngc 1439 and ngc 3377 , but these are exceptions .",
    "more typically , the predictions fall below the observations at large radii . as for core galaxies",
    ", this can probably be improved with a more general choice of initial conditions .",
    "overall , the fits to the hst photometry are quite acceptable , especially for core galaxies and somewhat less so for power - law galaxies .",
    "however , the main test of the proposed scenario is not whether individual profiles can be well fit , but rather whether the required bh masses are plausible .",
    "based on the general discussion in section  [ s : trends ] we already expect this to be the case , but this can now be tested in detail .      figure  [ f : bhmassdist]a shows the bh masses for all 46 sample galaxies as function of the @xmath17-band luminosity @xmath42 .",

    "so on average power - law galaxies do have larger bh masses than core galaxies , but the difference is not highly significant ( the errors on the mean @xmath198 are @xmath199 dex and @xmath167 dex , respectively ) .",
    "second , it was argued from the observed absence of core galaxies at @xmath4 and the observed absence of power - law galaxies at @xmath3 that the relation between @xmath136 and @xmath137 may have a slope less than unity .",
    "this is confirmed by equation  ( [ bhdisfit ] ) , but again not at high significance .",
    "third , it was argued that the absence of galaxies with intermediate slope brightness profiles may indicate a bimodality in the bh mass distribution .",
    "figure  [ f : bhmassdist]a shows that core galaxies and power - law galaxies do tend to occupy somewhat different different regions in the @xmath200 plane , but there does not seem to be a very clear bimodality . in particular , there is a region around @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) and @xmath203 in which the two types of galaxies overlap .",
    "the accuracy of the photometrically determined bh masses , @xmath204 , can be further assessed by studying individual galaxies with kinematically determined bh masses .",

    "the agreement is no poorer for power - law galaxies than for core galaxies .",
    "ngc 3115 has both a nuclear stellar cluster and a nuclear stellar disk , so the agreement for this galaxy strengthens the arguments of section  [ ss : fitacc ] that these components do not bias the bh mass estimate .",
    "overall , the results in figure  [ f : bhcompare]a provide additional credibility to the interpretation of observed surface brightness cusps in both core galaxies and power - law galaxies as due to adiabatic bh growth in initially isothermal cores .",

    "the range of possible velocity anisotropies in equilibrium systems is large ( e.g. , statler 1987 ) , and any anisotropy may have a significant impact on the inferred mass distribution ( binney & mamon 1982 ) .",
    "so the accuracy of the inferred bh masses is determined entirely by the unknown accuracy of the underlying model assumptions , as is the case for our photometric models .",

    "the isotropic kinematical models require larger bh masses than the photometric models .",
    "the galaxies at @xmath215 are all core galaxies ; if they have the massive bhs suggested by m98 , then our models predict much steeper brightness cusps than observed .",
    "van der marel ( 1998 ) showed that this discrepancy can be resolved by assuming that core galaxies have mild radial velocity anisotropy , either throughout the galaxy or only outside the core region ( for the case of an isotropic core ) .",

    "the bh masses inferred from isotropic models would be most in error for distant galaxies , for which the bh sphere of influence would be smaller than the spatial resolution of ground - based kinematical observations . a bh mass overestimate of a factor @xmath218 for a distant galaxy does not require an implausibly large velocity anisotropy , as was shown by van der marel ( 1998 ) for the case of ngc 1600 ( @xmath219 ) .",

    "the inferred values of @xmath56 are higher for power - law galaxies than for core galaxies , in agreement with the predictions of section  [ s : trends ] .",

    "the long - dashed line in the right panel of figure  [ f : modpar ] shows the prediction obtained by combining equations  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) and  ( [ upscor ] ) with equation  ( [ bhdisfit ] ) . this line does reproduce the trend in the inferred @xmath56 values adequately .",
    "overall , the results for individual galaxies validate the more general analysis of section  [ s : trends ] .",
    "we have studied a scenario for the nuclear structure of early - type galaxies based on the assumption that galaxies have central bhs that grew adiabatically in homogeneous isothermal cores , as first proposed by young ( 1980 ) , and we have compared the predictions of this scenario to the nuclear properties of early - type galaxies observed with hst .",

    "the main results are the following .    1 .",
    "the models can fit the full range of cusp slopes found at the smallest radii observable with hst , @xmath0 with @xmath221 , despite the fact that the models always predict @xmath6 at asymptotically small radii .",
    "the cusp slope at observable radii is determined by the dimensionless bh mass , @xmath9 , where @xmath222 is a measure of the mass of the ` progenitor ' core .",
    "models with larger @xmath56 yield larger cusp slopes @xmath8 .",
    "core galaxies ' have surface brightness profiles with a clear break , inside which @xmath1 . the break radius @xmath69 and break surface brightness @xmath71 obey scaling relations similar to those of the fundamental plane .",
    "the cusp slopes in these galaxies can be explained as the result of bhs with small values of @xmath56 : @xmath223 .",
    "the quantities @xmath165 and @xmath99 in models with small @xmath56 reflect the core radius @xmath50 and scale intensity @xmath57 of the progenitor core ( with proportionality constants of order unity ) .",
    "so the observed scaling relations for @xmath69 and @xmath71 are due to scaling relations that governed the properties of the homogeneous progenitor cores .",
    "` power - law galaxies ' are galaxies with @xmath2 .",
    "their surface brightness profiles have no clear break , and there are no characteristic radius and intensity for these galaxies that obey scaling relations similar to those for core galaxies . the steep cusps and absence of a break in these galaxies can be explained as the result of bhs with @xmath224 .",
    "it is attractive to assume that the progenitor cores of power - law galaxies obeyed the same scaling relations as the progenitor cores of core galaxies .",
    "this is plausible in view of the fact that power - law galaxies and core galaxies also follow the same fundamental plane relations , and it is consistent with observed brightness profiles outside the central region .",
    "4 .   at the small radii of interest ,",
    "the surface brightness profiles of individual galaxies are well fit by the models . to fit the data at all radii requires models with more realistic initial conditions at large radii .",
    "the inferred bh mass distribution for a sample of 46 galaxies with available hst photometry suggests a roughly linear correlation between bh mass and @xmath17-band galaxy luminosity , of the form @xmath18 ( rms scatter @xmath19 dex ) .",
    "this agrees with the average relation for the 18 nearby galaxies with kinematically well - determined bh masses , to within @xmath193 dex ( much better than rms scatter in either relation ) . for the four galaxies in common to both samples , the individually determined bh masses agree to within @xmath20 dex rms .",
    "5 .   in general",
    ", galaxies with @xmath3 are observed to have core profiles and galaxies with @xmath4 are observed to have power - law profiles .",
    "both profile types are found in galaxies with @xmath225 . in the models , two effects influence the predicted brightness profile as function of luminosity .",
    "first , the core mass @xmath226 increases more steeply with luminosity , @xmath227 ( f97 ) , than does the bh mass , @xmath12 .",
    "hence , @xmath13 , so that lower luminosity galaxies are predicted to have steeper cusp slopes . ,",
    "equation  ( [ upscor ] ) .",
    "this implies @xmath228 , which does not significantly alter the argument presented here . ]",
    "second , the core radius @xmath50 decreases with decreasing luminosity ( f97 ) , such that any break present is more difficult to observe in low - luminosity galaxies . at the distance of the virgo cluster ,",
    "the models predict core profiles for @xmath229 and power - law profiles for @xmath15 , for galaxies that obey all scaling relations without intrinsic scatter .",
    "this naturally reproduces both the sense and the absolute magnitude of the observed transition . intrinsic scatter in the characteristic quantities",
    "@xmath50 , @xmath57 and @xmath11 can explain why both types of galaxies are observed in the region around the transition magnitude . 6 .",
    "observations indicate a bimodality between core galaxies and power - law galaxies .",
    "the former have @xmath1 and the latter have @xmath230 , with few galaxies showing intermediate slopes , @xmath141 .",
    "this bimodality correlates with the bimodality in the global properties of elliptical galaxies .",
    "core galaxies are luminous , have boxy isophotes and are pressure supported by an anisotropic velocity distribution ; power - law galaxies are less luminous , have disky isophotes and are flattened by rotation .",
    "the scenario presented here explains the observed bimodality in cusp slopes as a result of higher values of @xmath16 in disky galaxies than in boxy galaxies .",
    "the presence of gas and dissipation during the formation or last major merger of disky galaxies may provide a natural explanation for this .",
    "the scenario presented here is not unique .",
    "observed surface brightness cusps can be interpreted in many different ways , as stressed in section  [ s : intro ] . for example , the observed cusps may have formed dissipationally during galaxy formation , and may not have any relation to bhs at all .",
    "our scenario is also oversimplified in that it ignores the important issue of accretion events and mergers between galaxies , which will almost certainly alter the brightness profiles of the constituent galaxies ( f97 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the proposed scenario naturally predicts observational results that would otherwise remain unexplained ( e.g. , the correlation between cusp slope and luminosity ) , and it yields bh masses that agree with those determined kinematically .",
    "these findings single out the present scenario as a very attractive one among many possible ones , but it remains surprising that such a simple scenario would work so well .    the success of young s scenario does not teach us much about the processes of bh and galaxy formation , and their connection . even if the surface brightness profiles predicted by the models for a given bh mass are correct , this still does not imply that the bhs in galaxies must have grown adiabatically , or that there ever were progenitor systems with homogeneous cores .",
    "stiavelli ( 1998 ) showed that violent relaxation of stars around a pre - existing bh yields a similar end - state as do the models of young ( 1980 ) . a wide variety of scenarios in which bhs form before , during , or after the galaxies in which they reside , may therefore all lead to a similar end - state . in fact",
    ", this may well be the key to explaining why young s models fit the observations so well , despite their apparent simplicity .    if galaxies did in fact start out with homogeneous cores , this still leaves open the questions why these homogeneous cores formed in the first place , and why they followed the scaling relations of equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) .",
    "however , the scenario discussed here does resolve one puzzling issue .",
    "it explains through the presence of bhs why the observed nuclear properties of core galaxies follow relations like those of the fundamental plane , whereas the observed nuclear properties of power - law galaxies do nt .",
    "this reduces the search for understanding of the global and nuclear parameter relations of galaxies to a single problem , and suggests that our understanding of the global fundamental plane relations of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; burstein et al .",
    "1997 ) applies to the nuclear parameter relations as well .",
    "for example , the fact that the inferred progenitor cores of low - luminosity galaxies are smaller and denser than those of high - luminosity galaxies can probably be attributed to dissipation during galaxy formation ( f97 and references therein ) .",
    "possibly most importantly , the results in this paper provide strong new support to the hypothesis that all galaxies have bhs , and that bh masses scale approximately with galaxy luminosity according to equations  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) or  ( [ bhdisunifit ] ) .",
    "this remains difficult to prove in a model independent way , but is also indicated by several other studies of active and quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; m98 ; ho 1998 ) .",
    "it is also consistent with quasar statistics ( sotan 1982 ; chokshi & turner 1992 ; f97 ) .",
    "if every galaxy spheroid harbors a bh that was formed in a quasar phase through matter accretion with efficiency @xmath231 , then equation  ( [ bhdisunifit ] ) implies that @xmath232 ( van der marel 1998 ) .",

    "a useful surface brightness profile is available only for m31 , but there the presence of a double nucleus ( lauer et al .",
    "1993 ) prevents a meaningful comparison between our models and the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "the galaxies m84 , ngc 4261 , ngc 7052 and ngc 6251 are elliptical galaxies , but they all have pronounced dust disks across the nucleus .",
    "the rotation velocities of the ionized gas in these disks have yielded the bh mass determinations for these galaxies , but the dust prevents a reliable determination of the stellar brightness profile . for arp 102b",

    "thus , if these galaxies follow the scaling relations of section  [ s : trends ] , one expects to resolve neither a clear signature of a core , nor of a bh .",
    "the fact that bhs have in fact been detected kinematically implies that these galaxies apparently do not follow the scaling relations obeyed by other galaxies . for m32 and ngc 4342",
    "we discuss this in some detail below .",
    "the case of ngc 4486b was already discussed by f97 .",
    "this satellite galaxy of m87 has a brightness profile with a core , despite its low luminosity ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "f97 suggest that it was once more massive , but was stripped of mass through interaction with m87 .",
    "ngc 4486b also has a closely separated double nucleus ( lauer et al .",
    "1996 ) , which prevents any meaningful comparison between our models and the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "m32 is especially interesting in the present context because lauer et al .",
    "( 1992b ) showed that hst photometry for m32 can be adequately interpreted in terms of young s adiabatic bh growth models .",
    "m32 is classified by f97 as a power - law galaxy . in general",
    "we have used the approach for power - law galaxies of fixing @xmath50 to the value predicted by equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) when doing the adiabatic bh growth model fit .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath233 may not be appropriate for m32 .",
    "the scaling relation in equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) is based on the core galaxies in our sample , which span the luminosity range @xmath237 .",
    "by contrast , m32 has @xmath238 .",
    "small uncertainties in the slope of equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) therefore translate to large uncertainties in the predicted @xmath50 for m32 . based on these considerations",
    "we have done a model fit for m32 in which @xmath50 was not fixed a priori , but was varied to optimize the fit .",
    "the fit itself was done over the range of radii with @xmath239 and @xmath240 , where the upper limit of the fit range was adjusted iteratively during the fit .",
    "the best fit is shown in figure  [ f : indigalsm ] ; its parameters are listed in table  [ t : samplem ] .",
    "the inferred bh has @xmath241 , which agrees with the kinematically determined value @xmath242 ( from van der marel et al .",
    "1998 , modified to the same distance used here ) to within @xmath167 dex .",
    "this agreement is similar as for the galaxies with kinematically well - determined bh masses shown in figure  [ f : bhcompare ] .",
    "the value of @xmath16 for m32 is not atypical , and falls exactly on the relation of equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) .",
    "however , the best - fit model has @xmath243 , which exceeds the prediction of equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) by @xmath244 dex .",
    "this is approximately twice the rms scatter around equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) for core galaxies , insufficient to provide strong evidence that the progenitor core of m32 violates the scaling relations inferred for higher - luminosity galaxies .",
    "first , the discrepancy is only at the @xmath245 level ; second , uncertainties in the slope of equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) may have exaggerated the discrepancy ; and third , the luminosity of m32 may have decreased over time due to interactions with m31 , with resulting stripping of material .",
    "overall , the results for m32 are not inconsistent with the general scenario discussed in the context of our main sample .",
    "ngc 4342 is an s0 galaxy in virgo with a nuclear stellar disk ( van den bosch et al .",
    "1998 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "it has a power - law brightness profile , as expected for its luminosity ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "ngc 4342 violates the scaling relations of section  [ s : trends ] by having an anomalously large @xmath16 .",
    "cretton & van den bosch ( 1998 ) use hst stellar kinematics to derive @xmath247 .",
    "this yields @xmath248 , which exceeds the average relation in equation  ( [ bhlumcor ] ) by @xmath249 dex .",
    "this contrasts with the case of m32 , which has a ` normal ' @xmath16 , but a larger @xmath50 than expected .    to model the ngc 4342 surface brightness profile one would like to assume that it had a progenitor core obeying equation  ( [ rrhoisorel ] ) , i.e. , @xmath250 , but that it somehow grew an anomalously large bh .",
    "interpretation of the observed brightness profile then requires an adequate model of bh growth that influences the region _",
    "outside _ the homogeneous progenitor core . for this one needs an initial model that reproduces the large radii behavior of real galaxies .",
    "as discussed in section  [ ss : predic ] , the isothermal sphere is not sufficient for this .",
