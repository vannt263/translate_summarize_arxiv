    "the realization of quantum communications relies on setting up entanglement of high fidelity between two far - away physical systems . in practice photons",
    "are primarily used for the carrier of entanglement .",
    "if one tries to establish entanglement by sending photons directly to a remote place , however , the range of communication will be limited by their absorption losses in the transmission channel . a solution to",
    "the problem is quantum repeater @xcite .",
    "there have been two categories of physical approaches to realizing quantum repeater .",
    "one is dlcz protocol @xcite and its developments @xcite , which generate and connect entangled pairs of atomic ensembles over short distances through the coupling of single photon and collective atomic excitation modes .",
    "the other is qubus or hybrid repeaters @xcite involving the operations on both qubits and continuous variable ( cv ) states . in the past years",
    "the developmental works have improved the efficiency of the first type of quantum repeaters by several orders over the original dlcz protocol .",
    "a recent theoretical analysis @xcite , however , indicates that the minimum average time for distributing an entangled pair over @xmath0 km by the quickest quantum repeater scheme of the dlcz - type should be still more than a half minute .",
    "moreover , the phase noise caused by birefringence and polarization mode dispersion on the traveling single photons could damage the quality of the generated pairs . with the qubus repeater protocols , on the other hand",
    ", the operation efficiency can be quickly improved at the cost of the fidelity of the generated pairs , and the irremovable decoherence effect on the cv state qubus in transmission channel is simply from photon absorption loss .    in this work we present a new qubus repeater scheme combining some features of dlcz - type repeaters .",
    "the resources ( local input qubit state and memory space ) required in the scheme are flexible , and long distance entanglement with high quality can be quickly realized with such flexibility .",
    "with a single photon state in kerr medium generates an extra phase @xmath1 on the coherent beam .",
    "the 50/50 beam splitter transforms two coherent states @xmath2 , where @xmath3 or @xmath4 , to @xmath5 .",
    "a response of the photodiode d indicates that the two beams @xmath6 and @xmath7 are different with @xmath8    we start with the purification of the photon sources used in our scheme .",

    ", we apply a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement module illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in the module ,",
    "one of the laser beams in coherent state @xmath13 interacts with @xmath14 through a proper cross - kerr nonlinearity , e.g. , the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) medium , picking up a phase shift @xmath15 to @xmath16 if the single photon is present .",
    "the two coherent states after the interaction are compared with a 50/50 beam splitter and a photodiode .",
    "any response of the photodiode indicates that the coherent states are different as @xmath17 if the coherent beam amplitude satisfies @xmath18 , e.g. , the error probability @xmath19 will be as low as @xmath20 . with the light - storage cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) technique ,",
    "e.g. , it is possible to realize a considerably large @xmath15 at a single photon level @xcite . in our scheme",
    "we only need a very small xpm phase shift @xmath21 , which is matched by the sufficiently intense coherent beams @xmath13 , to lower the losses of the photonic modes in xpm process to a negligible level while achieving the close to unit @xmath22 in operation .    before the end of this section",
    ", we have a discussion on the photon detectors used in qnd modules . here",
    "we only need threshold photon detector whose operation is described by the positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which respectively correspond to registering no photon and registering photon . the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are photon detection efficiency and average dark count during detecting photons , respectively .",
    "since the mean dark count can be made small ( a realistic detector could have @xmath27 ) , the state of the photon source and the coherent beams in qnd module will collapse to    @xmath28    the tensor product of a pure state single photon and that of the two beams @xmath29 , as the detector in qnd module takes a response . here",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 . given a very large amplitude @xmath32 of the input coherent beams , the dominant part of the photon number poisson distribution of @xmath33 will be fairly away from the small photon numbers , and a realistic detector even with a low photon detection efficiency @xmath25 could obtain the output of eq .",
    "( [ detection ] ) almost with certainty",
    ". such detector can be simple photodiode .",
    "next , we respectively process two purified single photons at two different locations a and b with a linear optical circuit , as shown in fig .",
    "2 which outlines the setup to generate the elementary links .",
    "the purpose of the procedure is to transform an input photon pair in arbitrary rank - four mixed state , @xmath34 to that with the linear combination of only two bell states as the basis .",
    "the pure state components @xmath35 as the eigenvectors of @xmath36 are the linear combinations of bell states @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively representing the horizontal and the vertical polarization , and @xmath40 the eigenvalues of @xmath36 .",
    "its basis vectors @xmath41 are called even parity and @xmath42 odd parity , respectively . then , with two polarization beam splitters ( pbs ) , we convert any input into the ports @xmath43 and @xmath44 in fig . 2 to a which - path space .",
    "the polarization of the photon components on both path @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be transformed to h with half wave plates ( hwp or @xmath47 ) for the time being .",
    "the circuits a and b are constructed with 50/50 beam splitters , totally reflecting mirrors and the proper phase shifters , and any of the pure state component in a general input @xmath36 will be mapped to the superposition of four bipartite states over the pairs of output ports @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see appendix ) . over port @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the output is a linear combination of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; over the other two pairs of ports @xmath58 and @xmath51 , on the other hand , it is that of the other fixed set of bell states @xmath59 .",
    "if we project out the photonic components over one of the four pairs of the output ports , the resulting state will be in a subspace with a linear combination of such two bell states ( one even parity but the other odd parity ) as the basis vector .",
    "such projection can be done by two qnd modules ( see appendix ) .",
    "for example , by projecting out the components on @xmath52 and @xmath53 merged from the tracks @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( at both locations ) with hwp and pbs , we will realize the following non - unitary transformations of the basis vectors : @xmath62 a simple input state @xmath63 will be correspondingly transformed to @xmath64 with the common constant neglected . with this example",

    "the detection of a local qnd module heralds the single photon modes to be coupled to the traveling coherent beams and mapped to quantum memory . upon receiving a successful result of the @xmath66 module and the measurement result of the qnd module from location a , which are transmitted through a classical communication channel ,",
