    "non - gaussianity from the simplest inflation models , that are based on a slowly rolling scalar field , is very small  @xcite ; however , a very large class of more general models , e.g. , models with multiple scalar fields , features in inflation potential , non - adiabatic fluctuations , non - canonical kinetic terms , deviations from the bunch - davies vacuum , among others , predict substantially higher level of primordial non - gaussianity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review and references therein ) .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity can be described in terms of the 3-point correlation function of bardeen s curvature perturbations , @xmath4 , in fourier space : @xmath5 depending on the shape of the 3-point function , i.e. , @xmath6 , non - gaussianity can be broadly classified into two classes  @xcite .",
    "first , the local , `` squeezed , '' non - gaussianity where @xmath7 is large for the configurations in which @xmath8 .",
    "second , the non - local , `` equilateral , '' non - gaussianity where @xmath7 is large for the configuration when @xmath9 .",
    "the local form arises from a non - linear relation between inflaton and curvature perturbations  @xcite , curvaton models  @xcite , or the new ekpyrotic models  @xcite .",
    "the equilateral form arises from non - canonical kinetic terms such as the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action  @xcite , the ghost condensation  @xcite , or any other single - field models in which the scalar field acquires a low speed of sound  @xcite . while we focus on the local form in this paper , it is straightforward to repeat our analysis for the equilateral form .",
    "the local form of non - gaussianity may be parametrized in real space as  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath0 characterizes the amplitude of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "different inflationary models predict different amounts of @xmath0 , starting from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , beyond which values have been excluded by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) bispectrum of wmap temperature data , @xmath13 , at the @xmath14 level @xcite .    so far all the constraints on primordial non - gaussianity use only temperature information of the cmb . by also having the e - polarization information together with cmb temperature information , one can improve the sensitivity to the primordial fluctuations @xcite .",
    "although the experiments have already started characterizing e - polarization anisotropies @xcite , the errors are large in comparison to temperature anisotropy .",
    "the upcoming experiments such as planck satellite will characterize e - polarization anisotropy to a higher accuracy .",
    "it is very timely to develop the tools which can optimally utilize the combined cmb temperature and e - polarization information to constrain models of the early universe .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the standard lambda cdm cosmology with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . for all of our simulations we used healpix maps with @xmath21 pixels .      in our recent paper",
    "@xcite we described a fast cubic ( bispectrum ) estimator of @xmath0 , using a combined analysis of the temperature and e - polarization observations .",
    "the estimator was optimal for homogeneous noise , where optimality was defined by saturation of the fisher matrix bound .    in this paper",
    "we generalize our previous estimator of @xmath0 to deal more optimally with a partial sky coverage and the inhomogeneous noise .",
    "the generalization is done in an analogous way to how  @xcite generalized the temperature only estimator developed by @xcite ; however , the final result of @xcite ( their eq .",
    "( 30 ) ) is off by a factor of two , which results in the error in @xmath0 that is much larger than the fisher matrix prediction , as we shall show below .",
    "the fast bispectrum estimator of @xmath0 from the combined cmb temperature and e - polarization data can be written as @xmath22 , where @xcite @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    and @xmath29 is a fraction of the sky observed .",
    "indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 can either be @xmath32 or @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 is 1 when @xmath35 , 6 when @xmath36 , and 2 otherwise , @xmath37 is the theoretical bispectrum for @xmath38  @xcite , @xmath39 is the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations , and @xmath40 is the radiation transfer function of adiabatic perturbations .    it has been shown that the above mentioned estimator is optimal for the full sky coverage and homogeneous noise @xcite . to be able to deal with the realistic data , the estimator has to be able to deal with the inhomogeneous noise and foreground masks .",
    "the estimator can be generalized to deal with a partial sky coverage and the inhomogeneous noise by adding a linear term to @xmath41 : @xmath42 .",
    "for the temperature only case , this has been done in  @xcite .",
    "following the same argument , we find that the linear term for the combined analysis of cmb temperature and polarization data is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the @xmath46 and @xmath47 maps generated from monte carlo simulations that contain signal and noise , and @xmath48 denotes the average over the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the generalized estimator is given by @xmath49 which is the main result of this paper .",
    "note that @xmath50 , and this relation also holds for the equilateral shape .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to find the generalized estimator for the equilateral shape : first , find the cubic estimator of the equilateral shape , @xmath51 , and take the monte carlo average , @xmath52 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath51 contains terms in the form of @xmath53 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath54 are some filtered maps .",
    "use the wick s theorem to re - write the average of a cubic product as @xmath55 . finally , remove the mc average from single maps , and replace maps in the product with the simulated maps : @xmath56 .",
    "this operation gives the correct expression for the linear term , both for the local form and the equilateral form .",
    "one can find the estimator of @xmath0 from the temperature data only by setting @xmath57 .",
    "we have compared our formula in the temperature - only limit with the original formula derived by  @xcite ( their eq .",
    "( 30 ) ) , and found a discrepancy . to see the discrepancy ,",
    "let us re - write the estimator as : @xmath58 .",
    "our formula gives @xmath59 , while eq .",
    "( 30 ) of @xcite gives @xmath60 .    to make sure that our normalization gives the minimum variance estimator , we have done monte carlo simulations with varying @xmath61 .",
    "we find that @xmath59 minimizes the variance ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ normalization ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the analysis given in @xcite resulted in the larger - than - expected uncertainty in @xmath0 because of this error in their normalization of the linear term .",
    "the main contribution to the linear term comes from the inhomogeneous noise and sky cut .",
    "for the temperature only case , most of the contribution to the linear term comes from the inhomogeneous noise , and the partial sky coverage does not contribute much to the linear term .",
    "this is because the sky - cut induces a monopole contribution outside the mask . in the analysis one subtracts the monopole from outside the mask before measuring @xmath41 , which makes the linear contribution from the mask small @xcite . for a combined analysis of the temperature and polarization maps ,",
    "however , the linear term does get a significant contribution from a partial sky coverage ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fnl_stdev ] ) .",
    "subtraction of the monopole outside of the mask is of no help for polarization , as the monopole does not exist in the polarization maps by definition .",
    "( the lowest relevant multipole for polarization is @xmath62 . )",
    "the estimator is still computationally efficient , taking only @xmath63 ( times the @xmath31 sampling , which is of order 100 ) operations in comparison to the full bispectrum calculation which takes @xmath64 operations . here",
    "@xmath3 refers to the total number of pixels . for planck , @xmath65 , and",
    "so the full bispectrum analysis is not feasible while our analysis is .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ fnl_stdev ] , we show the variance of @xmath0 using the estimator ( with and without the linear term ) for the gaussian cmb simulations in the presence of inhomogeneous noise and partial sky coverage . for this analysis we use the noise properties that are expected for the planck satellite , assuming the cycloidal scanning strategy  @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous nature of the noise is depicted in the lower map of figure  [ noise_sabb ] where we show the number of observations ( @xmath66 ) for the different pixels in the sky . as for the foreground masks , we use wmap kp0 intensity mask and p06 polarization mask .",
    "we find that , with the inclusion of the linear term , the variance reduces by more than a factor of 5 .",
    "the linear term greatly reduces the variance approaching the fisher matrix bound . however , the estimator is close to , but not exactly the same as the fisher variance prediction in the noise dominated regime .",
    "nevertheless , we do not observe the increase of variance at higher @xmath67 : the variance becomes smaller as we include more multipoles .",
    "this result is in contradiction with the result of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the error in the normalization of linear term in their formula .    in the right panel of figure  [ fnl_stdev ]",
    ", we show the variance of @xmath0 again using gaussian simulations , but now in the presence of flat sky cut and in the _ absence _ of any noise .",
    "the purpose of the plot is to demonstrate ( as pointed out in the previous section ) that for the combined cmb temperature and polarization analysis , sky - cut does contribute significantly to the linear term .",
    "we find that the generalized estimator does a very good job in reducing the variance excess , and the simulated variance of @xmath0 does accurately saturate the fisher matrix bound .    can our estimator recover the correct @xmath0 , i.e. , is our estimator unbiased ?",
    "we have tested our estimator against simulated non - gaussian cmb temperature and e - polarization maps .",
    "the non - gaussian cmb temperature and e - polarization maps were generated using the method described in  @xcite .",
    "we find that our estimator is unbiased , i.e. , we can recover the @xmath0 value which was used to generate the non - gaussian cmb maps .",
    "the results for the unbiasedness of the estimator are shown in table  [ nong_fnl ] .",
    "the analysis also shows the unbiasedness of the estimator described in  @xcite .",
    ".unbiasedness of the generalized estimator .",
    "non - gaussian cmb maps with @xmath68 are used for @xmath69 .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath0 , @xmath70 , was obtained using gaussian simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figures  [ sabb ] and  [ noise_sabb ] show the maps @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which appear in the linear term ( eq .  [ slin ] ) of the estimator .",
    "these maps are calculated using 100 monte carlo simulations of the data .",
    "since the linear term contributes only in the presence of inhomogeneities , we also show these maps calculated with noise - only simulations ( i.e. no signal ) .",
    "notice how these maps correlate with the inhomogeneous noise ( as shown in the lower map of figure  [ noise_sabb ] ) .",
    "upcoming cmb experiments will provide a wealth of information about the cmb polarization anisotropies together with temperature anisotropies .",
    "the combined information from the cmb temperature and polarization data improves the sensitivity to primordial non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "the promise of learning about the early universe by constraining the amplitude of primordial non - gaussianity is now well established . in this paper",
    "we have generalized the bispectrum estimator of non - gaussianity described in  @xcite , to deal with the inhomogeneous nature of noise and incomplete sky coverage .",
    "the generalization from @xcite enables us to increase optimality of the estimator significantly , without compromising the computational efficiency of the estimator : the estimator is still computationally efficient , scaling as @xmath73 compared to the @xmath74 scaling of the full bispectrum  @xcite calculation for sky maps with @xmath3 pixels . for the planck satellite ,",
    "this translates into a speed - up by factors of millions , reducing the required computing time from thousands of years to just hours and thus making @xmath0 estimation feasible .",
    "the speed of our estimator allows us to study its statistical properties using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have used gaussian and non - gaussian simulations to characterize the estimator .",
    "we have shown that the generalized fast estimator is able to deal with the partial sky coverage very well and in fact the variance of @xmath0 saturates the fisher matrix bound . in the presence of both the realistic noise and galactic mask , we find that the generalized estimator greatly reduces the variance in comparison to the  @xcite estimator of non - gaussianity using combined cmb temperature and polarization data .    since the estimator is able to deal with the partial sky coverage very effectively , the estimator can also be used to constrain primordial non - gaussianity using the data from ground and balloon based cmb experiments which observe only a small fraction of the sky .",
    "the estimator also solves the problem  @xcite of non - trivial polarization mode coupling due to foreground masks .",
    "earlier this issue was dealt with by removing the most contaminated @xmath75 modes from the analysis ( usually @xmath76 ) .",
    "the naive approach of using galactic masks to deal with the polarization contamination is to be refined .",
    "both temperature and polarization foregrounds are expected to produce non - gaussian signals .",
    "some sources of non - primordial non - gaussianity are cmb lensing , point sources , and the sunyaev zeldovich effect .",
    "understanding the non - gaussianity from the polarization foreground sources and refining the estimator to be able to deal with it will be the subject of our future work .",
    "some of the results in this paper have been derived using the cmbfast package by uros seljak and matias zaldarriaga @xcite and the healpix package @xcite .",
