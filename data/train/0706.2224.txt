    "the theory of crystal bases by kashiwara  @xcite provides a remarkably powerful tool to study the representations of quantum algebras @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , the calculation of tensor product multiplicities reduces to counting the number of crystal elements having certain properties .",

    "it turns out that the global crystal basis agrees with lusztig s canonical basis  @xcite , and it has many applications in representation theory .",
    "the main focus of this paper are affine finite crystals , that is , crystal bases of finite - dimensional modules for quantum groups corresponding to affine kac  moody algebras @xmath8 .",
    "these crystal bases were first developed by kang et al .",
    "@xcite , where it was also shown that integrable highest - weight @xmath5-modules of arbitrary level can be realized as semi - infinite tensor products of perfect crystals .",
    "this is known as the path realization .",
    "many perfect crystals were proven to exist and explicitly constructed in  @xcite .",
    "irreducible finite - dimensional @xmath9-modules were classified by chari and pressley  @xcite in terms of drinfeld polynomials .",
    "it was conjectured by hatayama et al .",
    "@xcite that a certain subset of such modules known as kirillov  reshetikhin ( kr ) modules @xmath10 have a crystal basis @xmath0 . here",
    "the index @xmath4 corresponds to a node of the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 except the prescribed @xmath11 and @xmath12 is an arbitrary positive integer .",

    ", we establish the existence of kirillov  reshetikhin crystals @xmath0 for all nonexceptional affine types in this paper :    [ thm : main ] the kirillov - reshetikhin module @xmath10 associated to any nonexceptional affine kac  moody algebra has a crystal basis @xmath0 .",
    "in addition we prove that for type @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 these crystals coincide with the combinatorial crystals of  @xcite . throughout the paper",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the kr crystal associated with the kr module @xmath14 .",
