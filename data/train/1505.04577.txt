    "multiplying numbers is much easier than the inverse problem of finding the factors of large integers .",
    "indeed , the security of codes relies on the current inability of a fast solution of this problem but is endangered by the well - known shor s factoring algorithm @xcite .",
    "recently , important works about the use of different kinds of exponential sums @xcite for factorization purposes have been published @xcite .",
    "our method differs from the past experimental realizations @xcite in three important simultaneous achievements @xcite .",
    "first , the division of @xmath0 by the test factors @xmath1 is not pre - calculated , but it is performed by the experiment itself .",
    "second , several test factors are tested simultaneously .",
    "third , a scaling property inherent in the recorded interferograms allows us to obtain the factors of an exponential number of large integers .",
    "the core of shor s factoring algorithm stands on the measurement of the periodicity in the dominant maxima of the quantum probability distribution at the output of a quantum computer @xcite . in line with shor s idea",
    ", the key behind the algorithm we present in this paper stands in the measurement of the periodicity in the maxima of continuous truncated exponential sums ( ctes ) by performing first - order `` factoring '' interference processes with a physical system .",
    "interestingly , the number n of necessary experimental runs scales logarithmically with respect to the largest integer to be factored .",
    "a noteworthy theoretical result at the core of the algorithm is that the periodicity of the resulting n interference patterns as a function of a continuous physical parameter in a given range , when appropriately scaled , allows us to achieve factorization of large numbers by simply looking at the interference maxima at integer values .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section ii",
    "will be given some mathematical background about ctes in connection with the hyperbolic function . in section",
    "iii we will describe the factoring algorithm for a generic physical system and the conditions this system must satisfy .",
    "we will provide a generalization of the described algorithm in section iv .",
    "section v and vi will address final remarks and perspectives of extensions to polynomial scaling methods of factorization , respectively .",
    "we define a continuous truncated exponential sum ( ctes ) in the form @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the modulo - squared value of the generalized curlicue function @xcite @xmath4\\bigg\\vert^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of integer order @xmath5 , with @xmath6 interfering terms , and @xmath7 is the hyperbolic function with continuous variable @xmath8 .    in fig .",

    "we note that @xmath13 has , for all the orders @xmath14 , a dominant maximum at @xmath15 with @xmath16 and decaying oscillations on the sides .",
    "the higher the order @xmath14 and the truncation parameter @xmath17 of the curlicue function are , the larger is the number of decaying oscillations on the sides and the sharper is the dominant peak .",
    "moreover , we recognize from eq .",
    "( [ curlicue ] ) the periodicity property @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider @xmath9 in the domain @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , @xmath20 is symmetric with respect to @xmath15 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this section , we will introduce a generalization of the ctes algorithm .",
    "in particular , we generalize the scaling property @xmath21 defining the new auxiliary variable @xmath22 where @xmath23 is equal to the product of one or more generic prime numbers @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "( [ rescaledcespatterns ] ) .    in a general analogue implementation , the auxiliary variable @xmath26 in eq .",

    "( [ x02 ] ) now reads @xmath39 with @xmath40 depending on the range ( [ range1 ] ) or ( [ range2 ] ) , respectively , of trial factors we are considering .",
    "this implies that the maximum factorable integer @xmath41 is upper limited by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the maximum value physically allowed for the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "we have described a novel analogue algorithm based on the experimental measurement of ctes interferograms @xmath45 depending on the continuous argument @xmath34 and the discrete parameter @xmath44 associated with two suitable physical observables @xmath29 and @xmath46 , respectively . the domain of factorable integers is determined by the range @xmath47 of the continuous variable @xmath34 and by the maximum value @xmath43 allowed by the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the largest integer @xmath41 factorable with a single ctes interferogram @xmath45 associated with a given value of @xmath44 and defined in a certain range @xmath47 is upper limited by the value @xmath48 . for larger integers @xmath0 the available physical spectrum of observable values @xmath34 may not be enough to cover all the trail factors either in the range @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "for this reason , we have introduced an algorithm based on the measurement of @xmath51 different interferograms @xmath52 , with @xmath37 , associated with the respective values @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the largest number factorable is upper limited by the value @xmath53 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the number @xmath51 of necessary experimental runs scales logarithmically with respect to the root of the number @xmath0 we want to factor .",
    "very interestingly our method allows a parallel factorization of an exponential number of large integers with respect to the number of binary digits @xmath54 associated with @xmath41 .",
    "these results are very important in view of the optical implementation of the algorithm described in ref .",

    "the values @xmath34 and @xmath44 defining the analogue interferogram @xmath45 correspond , respectively , to the wavelengths @xmath56 of a polychromatic source and to the unit of displacement defining the optical paths in a generalized michelson interferometer @xcite .",
    "indeed , an experimental proof of the principle of the ctes algorithm has been performed in the case of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , leading to the factorization of seven - digit numbers @xcite .",
    "we point out that any  classical \" implementation of the algorithm described so far would lack exponential speed - up .",
    "indeed , the largest number factorable @xmath41 is upper limited either by the value @xmath48 or @xmath59 , depending on the use of a single interferogram or a sequence of interferograms .",
    "moreover , the accuracy in the variable @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ oxi ] ) @xmath61 depends on the given experimental indeterminations @xmath62 and @xmath63 associated with the measurement of the observables @xmath29 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "this shows from eqs .",
    "( [ deltaxin1 ] ) and ( [ deltaxin2 ] ) that the unit @xmath44 defining the ctes interferograms in eq .",
    "( [ cespatternoxoxi ] ) needs to grow exponentially with respect to the number of bits associated with the largest number @xmath41 in the interval of integers to be factored .",
    "the ability to resolve the maxima associated with factors from non factors for larger and larger integers @xmath0 @xcite can be , in general , improved by implementing `` factoring '' interferograms of either a larger order @xmath14 or with a larger number @xmath17 of interfering terms as can be inferred by the relative curlicue functions in fig . @xmath64 .    ultimately , only a  quantum \" system able to encode such physical observables in a qubit representation in line with shor s algorithm would make it possible to avoid the requirement of exponentially large values for the observable @xmath46",
