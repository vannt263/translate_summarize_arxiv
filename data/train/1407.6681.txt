    "* in loving memory of my late father anwar *    * my mother adiba *    * jacob avner and daniel *",
    "the purpose of this book is to publicize both the random dynamics program as well as a possible approach to it using the theory of multicoloured random graphs , by giving a flavour of the properties of these graphs together with a hint of the associated mathematics .",
    "the random dynamics project is an approach to physics that differs from the usual bottom - up approach of building on known theory by unifying different phenomena into one theory .",
    "it is in the spirit of smolin s clearly - argued  @xcite need for radical rather than incremental approaches to furthering our understanding of how things work .",
    "its premise is that all symmetries , including the most fundamental ones such as lorentz and gauge invariance , can be derived without having to be assumed , even if the most fundamental laws at very high energies do not possess them .",
    "many symmetries such as charge conjugation , parity and strangeness are considered to arise from the _ gauge field theories _ of electromagnetic and strong interactions , whilst others arise from taking the limits in physical models such as for small mass - energies .",
    "the _ gauge group _ is a group of gauge transformations between the possible gauges . _",
    "gauge symmetry _ itself is perhaps not a true symmetry but a redundancy in our descriptions .",
    "however as well as its use in build theories it has been a mechanism in explaining fundamental issues such as why the weak charge depends on handedness and why there is parity violation in the standard model ( sm ) ? it has been argued  @xcite that gauge invariance protects quarks and leptons from gaining a fundamental mass that is large compared to the electroweak scale , and so their gauge charges must depend on handedness ; furthermore parity conservation in the electromagnetic and strong interactions is derived .",
    "the standard model comprises three leptons @xmath0 , three neutrinos @xmath1 , three up - type quarks @xmath2 , three down - type quarks @xmath3 .",
    "these undergo gauge field theory interactions mediated by the force carrier bosons , the photon , gluons and @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons .",
    "particles that have mass gain it through a condensing higgs boson .",
    "approximate sm symmetries such as chiral symmetry and gell - mann and neeman s @xmath6 flavour symmetry  @xcite can be derived in the limit as quark masses become ever smaller  @xcite .",
    "the handedness of a particle gives the direction of its spin vector along the direction of motion , and the sm prediction that neutrinos always have left - handed spin means that its spin vector always points in the opposite direction to its momentum vector .",
    "if there were only left - handed neutrinos , as required by the sm , then they would be massless for according to special relativity a neutrino with mass can not travel at the speed of light .",
    "then a faster moving observer could therefore overtake the spinning massive neutrino and would see it moving in the opposite direction and thus it would thus appear right - handed .",
    "so the non - zero neutrino mass and mixing that has been observed is evidence for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "although the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern may now have been excluded , the discrete family symmetry approach is still favoured after experimental measurements , it could still be a possible good first approximation to the observed data .",
    "the alternating group of even permutations of 4 objects @xmath7 is the simplest symmetry group to leading order that leads to tri - bimaximal mixing .",
    "altarelli , feruglio and merlo s speculation on the origin of @xmath7 as a subgroup of the modular group @xmath8 is in line with our suggestion that discrete sugroups in particle physics may arise as homomorphic images of this group .",
    "king and luhn have written a recent review article on discrete family symmetry approaches to modeling neutrino mass and mixings  @xcite .",
    "on his website , holger nilesen , the originator of the random dynamics philosophy states :    `` in the random dynamics scheme the predicament of the poor physicist is taken very seriously , as it is postulated that we simply can not deduce what the physics is like at the highest energy levels .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid carrying along the usual tacit assumptions in fabricating a theory of the fundamental physics , we consider a most general , `` generic '' mathematical structure which we equip with some general properties and notions .",
    "the ambition is to create a ( as explicit as possible ) list of assumptions , in order to pin down what conceptual luggage we can not do without , if we have the ambition of formulating a theory for the fundamental physics , which at our low energy level appears as the physics we observe , as described by the standard model . ''",
    "( http://www.nbi.dk/  kleppe / random/////qa / poor.html ) one motivation for the top - down random dynamics program are the laws of thermodynamics which were at first built upon certain principles but are now understood to be a reflection of the behaviour of large numbers of randomly - moving particles .",
    "symmetry has been identified as a key theme in understanding the principles underlying natural phenomena in theoretical physics .",
    "it represents the idea that observed physics is invariant under some symmetry transformation .",
    "the grand unification program in particular postulates that a larger gauge group beyond that relevant to the standard model ( sm ) corresponds to a particular force and that at lower energies this group breaks down to the sm group corresponding to the forces already discovered .",
    "random dynamics assumes that any extension of the sm can not be inferred from sm itself .",
    "the random dynamics project requires starting from general assumptions about an abstract relational mathematical construct and using very generic arguments because the idea is that the details of the very complicated laws are almost unimportant , only that we study them in some limits such as that of low energy .",
    "we take seriously their proposal to begin with a random mathematical structure and put forward evidence as to why the family of multicoloured random graphs provide a concrete possibility .",
    "a _ simple , undirected graph _ is an ordered pair @xmath9 consisting of a set @xmath10 of vertices , and a set @xmath11 of edges or lines which are @xmath12-element subsets of @xmath10 so that an edge is a relation on pairs of vertices .",
    "complete graph _ is one which has an edge on every pair of vertices , and its complement the _ null graph _",
    "is one which has only non - edges on every pair of vertices .",
    "an _ induced subgraph _ is one obtained by deleting vertices and the incident edges .",
    "a _ spanning graph _ is a subgraph of a graph that is a spanning tree ( having no cycles ) containing all the vertices of the over - graph .",
    "a bijection @xmath13 between the vertex sets of two graphs @xmath14 and @xmath15 is an _ isomorphism _ if @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 , then the isomorphism is an _",
    "automorphism_. an _ automorphism _ of a graph is a permutation of the vertex set preserving adjacency .",
    "choose a _ natural number _",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and a _ countable _ ( that is finite or countably infinite ) set @xmath10 of vertices and colour the edges of the complete graph on @xmath10 from @xmath20 colours @xmath21 , selecting colours independently for each edge at random . by a random colouring of a graph",
    "we simply mean an arbitrary colouring",
    ".    denote @xmath20-coloured random graphs by @xmath22 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath23 denotes the countably infinite vertex set . as we will only consider infinite graphs we can omit @xmath23 .",
    "they are defined by an infinite iteration of the following _ one - point extension property _ for @xmath20 edge - coloured graphs :    @xmath24 given finite disjoint sets @xmath25 of vertices there is a vertex @xmath26 such that all edges from @xmath26 to @xmath27 have colour @xmath28 @xmath29 .    for @xmath30 the colours are conventionally characterized as edges and non - edges .",
    "the random two - coloured graph @xmath31 has a countably infinite number of vertices .",
    "its most common variant is as a simple graph , thus having only two possible adjacencies with no loops on single vertices or multiple edges between pairs of vertices being permitted .",
    "it is a remarkable fact  @xcite that a countable two - coloured random graph is isomorphic to @xmath31 with probability @xmath32 .",
    "we denote the countable random graph with three adjacency types , which we call the _ triality graph _ , by @xmath33 .",
    "we can get from @xmath34 to @xmath31 by going colourblind in pairs of colours consecutively until there are only two colours left .",
    "there are three equivalent ways of characterizing @xmath31 up to isomorphism as a countable graph , these being the so - called one - point extension property , the injection property or a combination of universality and homogeneity  @xcite .",
    "a _ universal _ structure is one that contains all finite substructures , and a homogeneous structure is one for which any isomorphism between finite substructures extends to an automorphism of the entire structure . to say that a structure is homogeneous is equivalent to asserting that it has the maximum amount of symmetry ; or that many parts of the structure look alike ; or that the structure looks the same when viewed from many positions within the structure",
    "we have mentioned the uniqueness of the countable random graph ; it also has a huge amount of symmetry .",
    "most graphs , certainly finite ones , are _ asymmetric _ , that is they possess a trivial automorphism group consisting solely of the identity element .",
    "by contrast the automorphism group of @xmath31 and its multicoloured versions are gigantic , being uncountably infinite in size , thereby indicating a colossal degree of symmetry possessed by these graphs .    to see how remarkable and unexpected this is , contrast the situation with the finite case . construct a finite random graph on @xmath35 vertices by ordering the pairs of vertices in a countable sequence , and tossing a fair coin a total of @xmath36 times where heads means join the two vertices by an edge , and tails means do nothing . every @xmath35-vertex graph ( up to isomorphism )",
    "occurs with non - zero probability , and the probability of a particular graph arising is inversely proportional to its symmetry as measured by the order of its automorphism group .",
    "the asymmetric graphs are overwhelmingly more numerous than the symmetric ones .",
    "the probability measure associated with a countable sequence of coin tosses is discussed in category and measure appendix in  @xcite . to get a sense for the meaning of homogeneity beyond its definition consider that the pentagon or 5-cycle graph is homogeneous , but that the hexagon or 6-cycle graph is not because a pair of points two steps apart and a pair three steps apart are isomorphic as induced subgraphs but are not equivalent under automorphisms of the whole graph .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of homogeneous universal structures follow immediately from frass s theorem  @xcite on relational structures .",
    "the basic concept in frass s work is the _ age _",
    "age@xmath37 of a relational structure @xmath38 , which is the class of all finite structures ( over the same logical language ) which are embeddable in @xmath38 as induced substructures ; see the appendix on frass s theory of relational structures in  @xcite .",
    "as we stated , homogenous structures are those with the maximum amount of symmetry and one of the most useful methods for constructing objects with a large amount of symmetry is based on this theorem . in the two - colour case , thinking of a two - coloured complete graph as a simple graph , the appropriate structure is _",
    "rado s graph _ , or the erds - rnyi _ random graph _  @xcite @xmath31 ; it was richard rado  @xcite who gave the first construction of @xmath31 .",
    "relational structures with large automorphism groups have a high degree of symmetry ; this is also implied by an orbit space with a small number of orbits of the acting automorphism group . a countable homogeneous relational structure of a given type",
    "is determined up to isomorphism by the isomorphism classes of its finite substructures .",
    "an important outcome of frass s theorem is that determining the numbers of orbits on @xmath35-sets or @xmath35-tuples of _ oligomorphic _ permutation groups ( those having finitely many orbits in their induced action on @xmath35-tuples for all @xmath35 ) is equivalent to enumerating the unlabelled or labelled objects in certain classes of finite structures characterized largely by the _",
    "amalgamation property _ , which is a way of building larger structures from smaller ones ;",
    "see the appendix on frass s theory of relational structures in  @xcite .",
    "not all graph classes amalgamate ; for example , @xmath35-colourable graphs ( those having chromatic number at most @xmath35 ) do not have the amalgamation property .    the word _",
    "oligomorphic _ is intended to capture the notion of ` few shapes ' , where the group orbits contain a finite number of structures of any given finite size ( that is , few ) and each orbit contains an isomorphism class of structures ( that is , shapes ) .",
    "it is a fair assumption that the fundamental principles underlying physics are simple conceptions , whilst the phenomena themselves can be very complicated . in random dynamics it is postulated that this complexity is best described through randomness .",
    "the ambitious goal of random dynamics is to _ derive _ all the known physical laws as an almost unavoidable consequence of a random system which it is assumed would be a very general , random mathematical structure containing non - identical elements and set - theoretical notions such as subsets .",
    "it is proposed that the physics of our experience is derived from this basic mathematical structure , but as we do not have access to fundamental scales such as the plack scale the requisite mathematical object(s ) should have a generic structure , without a priori notions of distance , geometry , differentiability etc .",
    "the ` random ' aspect of the dynamics represents our lack of knowledge .    the infinite random graphs are simply defined and their open definition leaves much room for enhancing the graphs with a myriad of properties such as different topologies , required to model a particular physical fact .",
    "the surprising uniqueness ( up to isomorphism ) of the countably infinite random graph for a given number of edge - colours is of course reminiscent of this philosophy ; it means that given _ any _ finite graph , as more and more vertices are attached the eventual infinite graph is almost always isomorphic to @xmath31 .",
    "if even space and time are to be derived then paths in our connected random graphs may approximate the discrete time - slicing of points in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics ( qm ) and thereby give the principle of locality in qm .",
    "it may be that there are graph - theoretic criteria on the allowed paths in the path integral formulation or the decoherent histories interpretation of qm that narrow the possibilities for the sets of projective decompositions to which the histories correspond , and thereby help in the formulation and solution of problems ; see the section on quantum locality in  @xcite , where criticisms by bassi , kent and weinberg are mentioned together with references",
    ".    it would be advantageous if the graphs are supplemented with as little extra information as possible , and certainly properties such as topologies can be defined from the graph structure itself .",
    "some of the mathematics , such as probability measures on the graphs , is already worked - out in the literature ( see the appendix on category and measure in  @xcite ) and some will can be used to describe the observed world .",
    "the requirement that every useful physical model arises from the purported random mathematical structure requires us to take the most general , random mathematical structure @xmath38 . here",
    "again a graph is a very general structure linking with an edge only those points which are related and model theory provides a very general formalism and body of results giving substructures and in turn through their properties , primitive laws  @xcite .",
    "the various number systems can be arrived at from the mathematical structures .",
    "so for example natural numbers count the number of substructures and subtracting the number of certain types of substructures from the set of other types gives the integers .",
    "integers also count the number of vertices in @xmath31 , whilst being of uncountable order the real numbers enumerate the number of elements of the group @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "eventually a manifold structure will be required ( see below ) , for which real numbers are necessary .",
    "the uncountable order of the automorphism group @xmath40 of the multicoloured random graph on @xmath20 colours is one source .",
    "complex numbers can arise from a definition of an action principle in physics with a complex exponent .",
    "the geometric meaning of the imaginary `` i '' could simply be the introduction of rotations , as its basic action on the complex plane would attest .",
    "we emphasized the fundamental nature of the rotation group in  @xcite .",
    "physics at energies less than 300 gev is called ` infrared ' and above 1 tev is called ` ultraviolet ' . in the infrared limit an asymmetric @xmath41 theory , under suitable conditions , becomes @xmath42-invariant .",
    "there are many topologies and distance functions that are derivable from the random graphs .",
    "distance within a relational structure @xmath38 may be a function of the degree of difficulty in going from one substructure to another .",
    "random graphs have a _ topology of pointwise convergence _ of permutation groups that they support .",
    "a _ permutation group _ acting on a set @xmath43 is a subgroup of the symmetric group @xmath44 .",
    "the action is _ transitive _ if the only fixed subsets of @xmath43 are the empty set @xmath45 and the entire set @xmath43 , and _ primitive _ if in addition the only fixed partitions of @xmath43 are @xmath46 and the partition into singletons .",
    "thus a group is _ primitive _ if there are only the two trivial congruences , which are the relation of equality and the ` universal ' relation with @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "a group is _",
    "@xmath35-transitive _ if it is transitive on the set of ordered @xmath49-subsets of @xmath43 and it is _",
    "@xmath35-homogeneous _ if it is transitive on the set of unordered @xmath35-subsets of @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath50 be a permutation group acting on a countably infinite set @xmath43 .",
    "the natural topology on permutation groups is the _ topology of pointwise convergence _ in which for a sequence @xmath51 of permutations @xmath52 on @xmath43 , @xmath53 if and only if @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "( we shall assume that the permutation groups have countable degree ; for arbitrary degree we would have to consider limits of nets rather than sequences . )",
    "endowing a group @xmath50 with this topology turns it into a _ topological group _ , that is multiplication and inversion are continuous , so that if @xmath56 and @xmath57 then @xmath58 and @xmath59 . further endowing @xmath50 with a metric",
    "turns it into a complete metric space .",
    "this in turn can potentially give a manifold - like structure .",
    "it maybe that the graph - theoretic content of manifolds will eventually have to be considered .",
    "a lucid introduction to both the theory of graphs in surfaces and to homology on graphs is  @xcite but also see the more recent  @xcite .",
    "one of the few assumptions permitted in the nielsen program is the existence of _ exchange forces _ which permute subsystems of the abstract set of points thereby transposing particle states .",
    "that is , in a pair of particle states , the exchange force will exchange the two different particles occupying these states with each other .",
    "there are a large variety of possible types of permutations of random graph vertices that may be brought to bear here .",
    "we mentioned possible uses of _ switching automorphisms _ and _ almost automorphisms _ in modeling physics in  @xcite .",
    "a permutation @xmath60 of @xmath43 is an _ almost automorphism _ of a multicoloured graph @xmath14 on a vertex set @xmath43 if the colour of @xmath61 is equal to the colour of @xmath62 for all but finitely many @xmath12-element subsets of @xmath43 .",
    "that is a permutation of the vertex set of @xmath63 is an almost automorphism if the set of edges whose colour it alters is finite .",
    "we discuss switchings in a later chapter .    just as force is a gradient of energy with respect to position coordinates ,",
    "so exchange forces can generically be understood as the gradient with respect to the difference in energy depending on whether or not the pauli exclusion principle applies .",
    "exchange forces are central to the emergence of bosons and fermions , and so in rendering particles that are all different at fundamental scale but are effectively identical at low energies . one possible symmetry is a _ permutation _ of two sets of particles which corresponds to a boson symmetry between the two sets .",
    "this could be a local automorphism of two subsets of graph vertices .",
    "perhaps the permutation of two sets of fermions could be effected by anti - automorphisms .",
    "an _ anti - automorphism _ of a graph @xmath14 is an isomorphism from @xmath14 to the complementary graph @xmath64 wherein edges and non - edges are interchanged .",
    "the idea is that the particles are so restricted that they behave to all intents and purposes as if they were identical in almost all respects , and in this way they become subject to permutation symmetry operations .",
    "nielsen argues in his blog post that the addition of an extra particle to an already huge set of particles could be an argument for the @xmath65 symmetry for rotation of the superposition of the set of particles and thereby the particle should effectively have an @xmath65 symmetry .",
    "the random graph has stability properties such as for each vertex @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the starting point of the random dynamics project should be the consideration of as large a class of conceivable ` theories ' or ` models ' as possible .",
    "a probability measure might then be chosen for the set of models .",
    "the hypothesis is that a model chosen at random from this set will almost always contain the empirically known laws of nature ; that is all the presently known laws of physics will follow from almost any model which is sufficiently complicated enough , provided we go to some generic low energy limit .",
    "froggatt and nielsen state  @xcite :    `` at first , it may seem rather hopeless to try to derive low energy physics , or even the quantum field theory of glass , out of a totally random mathematical model .",
    "however we believe some concepts are so general that we can hope to find them relevant in almost any sufficiently rich and complicated ` model ' .",
    "for example it should be possible to introduce a crude concept of distance , or some sort of topology , on almost any mathematical structure @xmath68 which contains a huge number of ` elements ' having relations between themselves : the longer the chains of intermediate elements needed to establish a relation between two ` elements ' , the further apart the two ` elements ' are defined to be .",
    "for such a mathematical structure , rich in the sense of having a huge number of elements and also being rather repetitive , it must be possible to define the concept of small modifications @xmath69 $ ] of the structure @xmath68 . ''",
    "multicoloured random graphs would then seem to fit this approach and to provide us with a mathematical formalism that produces meaningful theory .",
    "so the idea behind the random dynamics program is that from almost all choices of the a priori fundamental laws based on structural stability , the resulting physical laws are unavoidable  @xcite , so that a small variation of the basic dynamics that is of the equations of motion , should not lead to an essential change .",
    "there is one important example that rhymes with this idea .",
    "poincar invariance is a given subgroup of the diffeomorphism reparameterisation group of general relativity , which under the transformation @xmath70 relates two coordinate systems by a lorentz transformation @xmath71 followed by a translation @xmath72 . as we mentioned in  @xcite ,",
    "one reason for the fundamental importance of the poincar group is that the poincar - invariant linear wave equations that are based on special relativistic quantum theory ( those of klein & gordon , weyl , dirac , maxwell , proca , rarita & schwinger , bargmann & wigner , pauli & fierz ) are projections of an irreducible sub - representation of the ( universal cover @xmath73 of the ) poincar group  @xcite .",
    "perhaps then the poincar group may be considered as being prior to both matter and spacetime .",
    "furthermore , physical quantities such as energy , momentum , and angular momentum can be _ defined _ as the conserved quantities associated to spacetime automorphisms via noether s theorem . within the random dynamics program itself ,",
    "froggatt and nielsen study a very general quantum field theory ( qft ) , which is not even assumed to be lorentz invariant , in the limit of free and lowest energy approximation  @xcite . a relativistic theory with just three and in the boson case in the form of the maxwell equations .",
    "however this works for one particle species on its own and does not , immediately at least , lead to lorentz invariance if many particle species are involved .",
    "the three space dimensions are derived from the fact that whilst the basic model assumes an arbitrary number of dimensions and has momentum degrees of freedom in all these dimensions , the velocity components in all but three dimensions turn out to be zero .",
    "thus almost all equations of motion would lead to internal symmetries such as parity , isospin , etc .",
    ", relativistic invariance and other special principles .",
    "then if known physics emerges as a consequence of all but those belonging to a special null measure set then there would be no need to consider laws of nature at all or at least only as approximations in some limit , and that the parameters of the fundamental dynamics are general rather than of a special type .",
    "relativity and 3-dimensionality of space could be derived in the limit of low energy per particle .",
    "more formally begin with the largest conceivable class of models and choose a measure on this class . using a probability measure we could ask for the probability that a given class of models is lorentz invariant .",
    "it could also lead to symmetries in certain limits  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 , chapter 6 ) .",
    "the hope is that neither the choice of measure nor the choice of parameters used to specify a measure on all the lattice models is significant  @xcite . the search would be for generic properties , derived from the topology on the set of objects or theories being studied .",
    "such properties would almost certainly be true when a measure exists on the set .",
    "a subset of a topological space is _ dense _ if it meets every nonempty open set .",
    "a space admitting a countable dense set is called _",
    "separable_. a _ polish space _ is a topological space that is separable and completely metrizable , meaning that its topology is induced by a complete metric .",
    "a topological group is _ polish _ if the underlying topology of the group is that of a polish space , with the open subgroups forming a base of open neighbourhoods of the identity @xmath32 .",
    "a property @xmath74 of elements of a topological space @xmath75 is said to be _ generic _ if the set @xmath76 is the intersection of countably many dense open subsets of @xmath75 .",
    "for example , being irrational is a generic property of the real numbers .",
    "the notion of genericity is standard and already well - studied when considering homogeneous structures such as random graphs .",
    "one way to construct the countable random graph that is equivalent to the usual method is as a countable _ generic structure _ where generic means construction by finite approximations .",
    "random graphs are defined in a space of graphs with a given property .",
    "the potential difficulties with this process are firstly that of defining a measure on this space and secondly that of determining whether or not a limit exists .",
    "even if a limiting structure exists it could be a surprising one . that a random structure is not always equivalent to a generic structure is exemplified by triangle - free graphs  @xcite . alternatively a _ generic structure _ is one that is residual in some natural complete metric space in the sense of the _ baire category theorem _",
    "( see category and measure appendix in  @xcite ) .",
    "this says that we can put a natural metric structure on the class of all objects with a given _ age _ or smaller so that the isomorphism class of such objects is residual , or in other words that almost all objects look like the one we are interested in .",
    "endowing a topological group @xmath50 with a metric turns it into a complete metric space , so we can use the baire category theoretic notion of _ meagre_. the topology is generated by basic open sets of the form @xmath77 = \\{g \\in g : g\\ \\text{agrees with}\\ p\\ \\text{on its domain } \\}$ ] where @xmath78 is a @xmath32@xmath32 map from a finite subset of @xmath43 to @xmath43 .",
    "the automorphism group of any relational structure is a closed subgroup of @xmath44 and so is automatically a complete metric space , and therefore we can talk about generic automorphisms .",
    "generic automorphism _ is one whose conjugacy class within the group is large in the sense of baire category .",
    "one way of capturing the notion of @xmath79 being a ` typical ' element is to require @xmath79 to lie in certain _ dense open sets_. an example of a dense open set for any @xmath80 is the set @xmath81 .",
    "a homogeneous structure will have a generic automorphism , where a _",
    "generic element _ of the automorphism group is one that lies in a comeagre conjugacy class relative to the given topology .",
    "let @xmath50 be a permutation group acting on a countably infinite set @xmath43 .    for more on the notion of _ generic automorphism _",
    "see  @xcite .    in mathematics ,",
    "a lattice is a vector space .",
    "more accurately , a lattice @xmath82  [ mathbbl ] in a real finite - dimensional vector space @xmath10 is a subgroup of @xmath10 satisfying one of the following equivalent conditions :    \\(i ) @xmath82 is discrete and @xmath83 is compact ; ( ii ) @xmath82 is discrete and generates the @xmath84-vector space @xmath10 ;    \\(iii ) @xmath10 has an @xmath84-basis @xmath85 which is a @xmath86-basis of @xmath82 ( that is @xmath87 .",
    "so a lattice in @xmath88 is the set of integral linear combinations of @xmath35 linearly independent vectors .",
    "the lattices generated by vectors of norm @xmath32 are @xmath89 with the standard bilinear form .    in this brief book",
    "we can only give a flavour of the random graph mathematics that can be put to use in modelling random dynamics .",
    "one question we could seek to answer is : given a certain natural topology on the set of all lattice theories show that lorentz invariance is a generic property in the low energy limit .",
    "a lattice could reasonably be taken to be a low energy limit of a graph .    amongst the derived symmetries to which it is hoped that the random dynamics approach can be applied  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  vii ) are :    \\(i ) macroscopic scaling symmetry present for a very large number of molecules but absent at the atomic scale ;    \\(ii ) five symmetries derived from the sm , ( a ) charge conjugation invariance , ( b ) parity invariance , ( c ) time reversal invariance , ( d ) flavour conservation ( including any baryon and lepton number conservation ) , and ( e ) chiral symmetry ( including gell - mann - neeman @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are exact symmetries for example @xmath90 invariance , baryon number conservation and conservation of lepton number for each generation .",
    "approximate symmetries such as @xmath91 , @xmath74 , and @xmath92 , flavour and chiral symmetries are derived .",
    "given that parity and strangeness conservation are derivable from the strong and electromagnetic interactions there is no reason why weak interactions should conserve them .",
    "poincar symmetry , including rotational and space - time translational symmetries are considered part of the diffeomorphism symmetry of general relativity .",
    "so a proper account of their origin must go beyond known theory to consideration of say a pregeometric theory , as must any account of gauge invariance .",

    "the three generations of left - handed and right - handed quark fields ( up - type quarks are not distinguished from down - type quarks ) carry different charges under @xmath606 such that the usual yukawa terms have positive integer charges .",
    "the hierarchy in the yukawa matrix entries arises from powers of the flavon field compensating for these non - zero charges of the above trilinear yukawa terms .",

    "the uniqueness of the multicoloured random graphs on a given set of colours in the infinite - vertex limit starting from arbitrary initial configurations would seem to suggest that the physical interpretation of any result derived therefrom would be independent of initial conditions .",
    "one physical interpretation that we have in mind is this : that the growth of a graph from an arbitrary initial configuration to the infinite random graph is mirrored by taking the limit of a large number of particles .",
    "there are many instances of limits of large numbers in physics , such as the hydrodynamical scaling law for an incompressible fluid being derived when the number of fluid molecules becomes very large  @xcite .    the intimate relationship between the modular and 3-braid groups , for example that the 3-braid group @xmath608 is the universal central extension of the modular group  @xcite , offers a direction for further study .    a key test for any theory that extends the sm model will be in its ability to better explain the sm coupling constants and mass parameters .",
    "it is possible that quantum field theory will only be able to do this through the introduction of a new ingredient such as a supplementary symmetry .",
    "the hope has been that application of the mpp gives information about these sm parameters .",
    "it is also possible that such additional restricting principles are not a priori clearly or directly related to the dynamical entities and only deeper work would reveal the connections . in  @xcite we have proposed candidates and have tried to motivate them .",
    "it could be argued that the restrictions should , for reasons of simplicity , apply to the zero - particle states , that is the vacua .",

    "it functions according to a precision , which is why mathematics is often required for its proper explanation and description . scientific theories",
