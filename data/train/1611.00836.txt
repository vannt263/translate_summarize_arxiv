    "in many cell types , cell membranes are composed @xcite of a diverse array of lipids , organized as a lipid bilayer , and membrane proteins , which play a central role in most cellular processes .",

    "<S> thickness deformations can be captured by considering compression and expansion of the bilayer hydrophobic core , membrane tension , and bilayer bending , resulting in biharmonic equilibrium equations describing the shape of lipid bilayers for a given set of bilayer - protein boundary conditions . here </S>",
    "<S> we develop a combined analytic and numerical methodology for the solution of the equilibrium elastic equations associated with protein - induced lipid bilayer deformations . </S>",
    "<S> our methodology allows accurate prediction of thickness - mediated protein interactions for arbitrary protein symmetries at arbitrary protein separations and relative orientations . </S>",
    "<S> we provide exact analytic solutions for cylindrical integral membrane proteins with constant and varying hydrophobic thickness , and develop perturbative analytic solutions for non - cylindrical protein shapes . </S>",
    "<S> we complement these analytic solutions , and assess their accuracy , by developing both finite element and finite difference numerical solution schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we provide error estimates of our numerical solution schemes and systematically assess their convergence properties . taken together </S>",
    "<S> , the work presented here puts into place an analytic and numerical framework which allows calculation of bilayer - mediated elastic interactions between integral membrane proteins for the complicated protein shapes suggested by structural biology and at the small protein separations most relevant for the crowded membrane environments provided by living cells . </S>"
