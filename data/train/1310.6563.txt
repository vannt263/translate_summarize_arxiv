    "* background : * kondo tunnelling through carbon nanotube quantum dots cnt(qd ) has recently become a subject of intense theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies .",
    "one of the motivations for pursuing this research direction is the quest for achieving an exotic kondo effect with su(n ) dynamical symmetry,@xcite based on the peculiar properties of electron spectrum in cnt.@xcite achieving su(4 ) symmetry is natural because the energy spectrum of metallic cnt consists of two independent valleys that touch at the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points of the brillouin zone .",
    "the energy levels possess degeneracy in both spin ( @xmath8 ) and isospin ( or valley @xmath9 ) quantum numbers .",
    "thus , due to both spin and isospin degeneracy , an su(4 ) kondo effect takes place.@xcite    * motivation : * achieving even higher degeneracy su(n@xmath104 ) of the qd is highly desirable .",
    "firstly , the kondo temperature dramatically increases with @xmath11 .",
    "secondly , there is a hope to expose novel physical observables that are peculiar to these higher symmetries . in the present device , higher degeneracy",
    "may be obtained by employing the orbital ( cylindrical ) symmetry of electron states in cnt , an option which so far has not been effectively employed in this quest . in order to manipulate these orbital features ,",
    "the fact that adsorption of oxygen , hydrogen or fluorine atoms on the surface of the cnt gives rise to gap opening in the spectrum of the metallic cnt.@xcite realization of su(n@xmath12 ) kondo effect then becomes feasible , since there is now spin , isospin ( valley ) and orbital degeneracy .",
    "* the main objectives : * the main goals of the present work are : 1 ) to show that su(12 ) kondo effect in the cnt(left lead)-cnt(qd)-cnt(right lead ) structure is indeed achievable and 2 ) to elucidate the physical content of this structure at the kondo regime as encoded by tunneling conductance and the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the first goal obtains by designing the electron spectrum in the cnt(qd ) to have a 12-fold degeneracy following adsorption of hydrogen atoms combined with an application of a non - uniform gate potential .",
    "namely , the energy levels of the central element cnt(qd ) are tunable into a three - fold orbital degeneracy for @xmath5 ( where @xmath13 is the component of the orbital angular momentum along the cnt axis )",
    ". the second goal is achieved through quantitative analysis , based on perturbation theory at high temperatures and mean field slave boson formalism at low temperature .    * the main results : * the energy spectrum of the cnt(qd ) gated by a spacially modulated potential",
    "is elucidated , and the possibility to get a cnt(qd ) with twelve - fold degenerate quantum states is substantiated .",
    "this cnt(qd ) is then integrated into a tunnelling junction cnt(left lead)-cnt(qd)-cnt(right lead ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - cn - qd - cn ] .",
    "when the ground state of the interacting cnt(qd ) is occupied by a single electron , kondo tunneling with su(12 ) dynamical symmetry is realized .",
    "this exotic kondo effect is quantitatively analyzed .",
    "first , the corresponding kondo temperature is calculated and shown to be much higher than in the standard su(2 ) kondo effect .",
    "the tunneling conductance @xmath14 and the magnetic susceptibilities @xmath15 , @xmath16 for respective magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the cnt axis are calculated in the weak ( @xmath17 ) and strong ( @xmath18 ) coupling regimes .",
    "the low temperature dependencies of both @xmath14 and @xmath19 are entirely distinct from their analogs pertaining to the su(2 ) kondo effect in quantum dot . @xcite more concretely , the temperature dependence of both quantities is shown to have a peak at _ finite temperature _",
    ", unlike the familiar monotonic behavior encountered in the ordinary su(2 ) kondo effect in quantum dots",
    ". moreover , inspection of the magnetic susceptibility exposes an observable peculiar to the su(12 ) symmetry ( or other su(n ) symmetry with @xmath20 ) : it is shown that the magnetic response is anisotropic , that is , @xmath21 .",
    "even more remarkable , the ratio @xmath22 is a  universal number \" depending only on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , that are the orbital and spin @xmath7 factors of electrons in the cnt(qd ) ( and not on temperature ) .",
    "these distinctions open the door for experimental manifestation of this peculiar junction .",
    "this is helped by the unusually high kondo temperature that enables the measurement of the tunneling conductance in the kondo regime at relatively high temperature .",
    "* organization * : this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec - model ] , we describe the basic structure of an infinitely long metallic cnt with adsorbed hydrogen atoms .",
    "the energy spectrum of the cnt(qd ) is discussed in section [ sec - dot ] .",
    "the anderson model for the tunnel junction is introduced in section [ sec - anderson ] , followed by section [ sec - kondo ] in which the anderson hamiltonian in the local moment regime is mapped on a spin hamiltonian , poor - man scaling equations for the coupling constants are derived , and the kondo temperature is evaluated . in sections [ sec - cond ] and section [ sec - magn ]",
    "the results of our calculations of the tunnelling conductance and the magnetic susceptibilities are respectively presented both in the weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "the main achievements of the present work are summarized in section [ sec - concl ] .",

    "else , it becomes a semiconducting nanotube with a finite band gap.@xcite the band structure of a metallic cnt exhibits two dirac points with a right- and left - moving branch around each dirac point .",
    "a peculiar consequence of the dirac nature of charge carriers in cnt is that electrons can tunnel through a potential barrier without reflection.@xcite this klein paradox prevents a practical aspect of cnt : it is virtually impossible to trap an electron in between potential barriers , as it can escape out .",
    "it also hinders the formation of a gap in the band spectrum .",
    "fortunately , this can be circumvented by chemical modification of the cnt . in refs.@xcite",
    "it is shown that when radicals such as atomic oxygen , hydrogen or fluorine are adsorbed on the graphene surface they form covalent bonds with the carbon atoms .",
    "these covalent bonds are realized since the carbon atoms change their hybridization from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , and that results in the opening of a band gap ( similar to the situation in diamond crystals ) .",
