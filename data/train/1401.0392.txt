    "these outflows are far more violent , and clear galaxies of gas @xcite , leaving them red and dead .",
    "the observed large - scale outflows contain mostly molecular gas .",
    "this is , in princple , a problem for the agn wind feedback model , because outflowing gas is accelerated by a shock and heated to temperatures of @xmath13  k , much higher than molecular dissociation temperatures .",
    "although cold clumps could be embedded in the ambient medium and carried with the flow , such acceleration would produce signatures incompatible with observations .",
    "we show here that radiative cooling rapidly puts a large fraction of the outflowing material into molecular form , which stably coexists with tenuous hot gas .",
    "this simultaneously explains the large velocity of the molecular component and its immunity to high mach number shocks , in agreement with observations .",
    "we review the properties of the forward shock that the outflow drives into the ism in section [ sec : shock ] and show that it can not be kept thermally stable at high temperatures by quasar radiation in section [ sec : stability ] .",

    "the very high temperature of the wind shock near @xmath19 implies that these outflows should be intrinsically luminous gamma ",
    "ray sources.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the dynamics of spherically - symmetric energy  driven outflows from accreting agn are described in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the wind shocks against the surrounding ism and drives an outflow .",
    "close to the black hole , the shocked wind cools rapidly by the inverse compton effect of the agn radiation field , and the resulting outflow of swept  up gas is relatively slow and must ultimately fall back .",
    "but once the mass of the central black hole grows above the critical value @xmath21 ( eq . [ eq : msigma ] ) , the wind shock and swept  up ism can reach large radii , where the agn radiation field is too dilute to cool the shocked wind gas .",
    "now all of the wind energy goes into powering the outflow , rather than almost all being lost to cooling .",
    "this extra energy accelerates the outflow , increasing its velocity at the contact discontinuity between the wind and the interstellar medium to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radiative efficiency of accretion and @xmath24 is a factor allowing for deviations of the gas - to - total density ratio @xmath25 from the cosmological value ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for derivation of @xmath26 ) .",
    "an outer shock moves ahead of this discontinuity into the ism , sweeping the latter up and compressing it .",
    "adiabatic jump conditions give a velocity @xmath27 for this forward shock @xcite .",
    "this heats the ism to a temperature @xmath28 where @xmath29 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath30 is the mean mass per particle . the particle density of the swept  up",
    "ism is @xmath31 which is just @xmath32 times the preshock particle density , as appropriate for a strong shock .",
    "the interstellar gas which has passed through the outer shock is relatively dense , and so likely to cool quite rapidly below the shock temperature .",
    "the primary cooling process at the shock temperature is free - free cooling , and outflows are optically thin to this radiation : @xmath33 where we take @xmath34 , appropriate for fully ionized gas of solar metallicity .",
    "the pressure within the shocked outflow is approximately constant @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interface between the shocked wind and the outflow is highly rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) unstable ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see section [ sec : stability ] ) .",
    "rt fingers mix the shocked cooling interstellar gas with the dilute hot wind gas inside it , maintaining a constant pressure within the whole outflow .",
    "this pressure decreases over time as @xmath35 .    from the above considerations , the following picture of a composite outflow emerges .",
    "most of the outflowing mass is in the form of the shocked ism at temperatures below a few times @xmath36  k. this gas is mixed ( by rt instabilities ) and maintains a pressure equilibrium with the much hotter shocked wind .",
    "we show this schematically in figure [ fig : cartoon ] . to determine the observational appearance of this mixture we need to consider whether the shocked ism can be kept at these large temperatures for a long time .",
    "an important aspect of the thermal evolution of outflowing gas is its phase structure .",
    "the gas can either cool as a single - phase medium and experience strong compression by the shocked wind into a narrow shell , or it can develop a two - phase structure with cold gas embedded in the tenuous , high - pressure hot medium . therefore we consider whether a multiphase equilibrium between cold gas clumps and a surrounding diffuse outflow is possible .",
    "following @xcite , we define a pressure - based ionization parameter @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the quasar luminosity , which we take to be a fraction @xmath39 of the eddington luminosity , with the mass of the smbh a fraction @xmath40 of the critical @xmath21 mass ( see section [ sec : shock ] ) , so that @xmath41 substituting the expressions for luminosity , density ( eq . [ eq : nshock ] ) and temperature ( eq . [ eq : temp ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ion ] ) , we find @xmath42 where we expect @xmath43 in general .",
    "figures 4 and 5 of @xcite show that for @xmath44 the outflowing gas can only be stable in a cold phase .",
    "the ionization parameter does not change as the outflow expands , because both radiation and gas pressures decrease as @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the only way to establish an equilbrium is to reduce the gas fraction @xmath46 . as the gas cools and molecular clumps detach from the hot flow , the density in the latter decreases , but a reduction by a factor @xmath47 is necessary before equilibrium can be established .",
    "therefore we predict that the diffuse gas envelope surrounding the molecular clumps is very tenuous , and almost all the outflow mass is in molecular form .",
    "the separation of the outflow into a two - phase medium is not a new result .",
    "@xcite showed that energy - driven outflows are highly rt unstable , therefore a complicated mixture of shocked wind and outflow gas would emerge even without any cooling processes . @xcite",
    "used numerical simulations to show that cooling outflows fragment , but did not investigate the reasons for fragmentation in detail .",
    "gravitational instability of expanding supernova shells was predicted analytically by .",
    ". for low gas fractions and at large radii , radiative two - body cooling is inefficient , so the gas stays hot ( @xmath48  k ) .",
    "there is a sharp transition at a particular radius for every gas fraction ; within this radius , gas is cool ( @xmath49  k ) and the resulting two  phase instability leads to the formation of molecules .",
    "the line at @xmath50  k is a lower limit of our integrator rather than a physical barrier.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    ) .,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we now turn our attention to the efficiency of cooling processes acting in the shocked ism .",
    "the outer shock temperature is approximately equal to the compton temperature ( @xmath51  k ) , so compton cooling  the primary process of cooling the shocked wind  does not affect the shocked ism . instead , at temperatures @xmath52  k , gas predominantly cools via two ",
    "body processes , i.e. bremsstrahlung and metal line cooling . to estimate the cooling timescale",
    ", we numerically integrate the cooling function from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their appendix c for details ) , which is appropriate for optically thin gas illuminated by quasar radiation ; as we showed above ( eq . [ eq : taushock ] ) , this is a valid assumption .",
    "we perform the calculations for a range in gas fraction , @xmath25 , between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and at distances from @xmath55  pc to @xmath56  kpc . for each of those , we integrate the cooling for one dynamical time @xmath57 , assuming the pressure is constant and equal to that of the shocked wind gas .    the results are plotted in figures [ fig : outcool ] and [ fig : outtemp ] .",
    "the first one shows the gas temperature after one dynamical time as a function of radius for several gas fractions @xmath25 .",
    "there is a clear difference between two regimes : low density gas far away from the smbh cools inefficiently , while closer in or at higher density , cooling rapidly decreases gas temperature to the lower limit of the adopted cooling function , @xmath58  k. a sharp transition seen in the low density curves ( @xmath59 ) can be identified as a cooling radius similar to the cooling radius @xcite of the wind shock . from the integration results , we find this outer cooling radius to be @xmath60 where ` oc ' stands for ` outflow cooling ' .",
    "therefore , as long as the gas density is @xmath61 times the total density , the shocked interstellar gas in the central few kiloparsecs is efficiently cooled .",
    "as it cools , the gas is likely to fragment into cold clumps surrounded by a hot diffuse medium .",
    "a precise treatment of this fragmentation is beyond the scope of this letter ; we only note that @xcite showed the existence of such fragmentation numerically .",
    "once the gas temperature falls below a few times @xmath62  k , atomic and molecular hydrogen and metal cooling become important . calculating the effect of these elements precisely is very complicated , as cooling rates strongly depend on gas opacity , chemical abundance and various other local parameters .",
    "here we only make a rough estimate .",
    "we take the cooling rate of atomic gas just below @xmath62  k to be @xmath63 as given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6.2 ) .",
    "this is a conservative estimate , as it does not include the contributions of metal lines or molecular hydrogen .",
    "the gas density appropriate for this cooling process is @xmath64 , because the clumps of atomic gas are much denser than the average density in the shocked ism . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : nshock ] ) gives the cooling rate @xmath65 the corresponding cooling time , assuming the rate is constant , is @xmath66 this cooling timescale is much shorter than dynamical time for any reasonable value of @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude that once gas cools down to atomic temperatures by two ",
    "body processes , the subsequent atomic and molecular cooling is very efficient , and rapidly puts most of the outflowing matter into molecular form .",
    "cold clumps of molecular gas , possibly shielded from the quasar radiation by envelopes of atomic hydrogen ( the warm phase of the ism ) , are perfect locations for star formation . as a result",
    ", we expect large - scale agn outflows to form stars moving with large radial velocities .",
    "such an effect was found in numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite , but they used only rough approximations for the rate of outflow fragmentation . here",
    "we provide four estimates for an upper limit of star formation rate in the agn outflow :    \\a ) the cooling timescale estimate .",
    "this simply gives the rate at which gas in the outflow is converted into the cold molecular phase .",
    "the cooling timescale can be approximated by a power - law @xmath68 the total mass of the outflowing gas is @xmath69 therefore , the approximate gas cooling rate is @xmath70 this estimate , however , assumes that there is enough hot gas consumed by the outflow to be cooled down .",
    "this is not the case in reality , since the cooling timescale is typically faster than the flow timescale .",
    "\\b ) the `` locally dynamical '' estimate . independently of how rapidly the gas cools , it can not fragment faster than on its local dynamical timescale . for gas of density @xmath71 ,",
    "this timescale is @xmath72 which translates into a star formation rate of @xmath73    \\c ) the true parameter governing the rate of gas cooling and fragmentation is the rate at which the outflow sweeps up new mass : @xmath74 these three limits scale differently with galaxy and outflow parameters , so the true dynamical limit is the lowest of the three .",
    "however , this is only the limit on gas cooling and fragmentation rate , because it does not account for star formation feedback .",
    "\\d ) a rough estimate of the true star formation rate can be made by assuming that star formation feedback ( in the form of photoionization , massive star winds and supernova explosions ) heats and disperses the cold gas . in this way",
    ", the star formation process self - regulates so that the feedback energy injected by the stars balances the cooling rate of the gas .",
    "the energy loss rate is @xmath75 the stellar feedback luminosity that affects the gas is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a feedback coupling efficiency and @xmath78 is the stellar mass - to - luminosity conversion efficiency @xcite . requiring that the feedback luminosity balances the cooling rate gives @xmath79 since not all of the stellar luminosity is absorbed by the surrounding material ( due to both geometry and varying opacity ) , the true upper limit to the star formation rate is somewhat higher .",
    "the above estimate does not depend on the rate at which the outflow accumulates mass .",
    "if all the gas is cold , star formation still self - regulates at a value set by balancing the actual cooling of gas ( heated by the stellar feedback processes rather than the forward shock ) with the energy input rate .",
    "this star formation rate results in a luminosity of young stars of @xmath80 , comparable to or slightly higher than the luminosity of the agn that drives the outflow .",
    "we make a rough estimate of the typical size of gravitationally bound fragments . since the cooling timescale is much shorter than dynamical for most values of @xmath67 and @xmath46 , the outflowing gas cools and fragments in a very narrow region , defined by the cooling timescale @xmath81 and the sound speed in the post - shock gas @xmath82 : @xmath83 if we assume that the clumps form from material initially distributed in regions with length scales of order @xmath84 , the clump mass is of order @xmath85 i.e. the clumps have masses typical of molecular clouds .",
    "the high outflow pressure ensures that their densities are much larger than typical for molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , their radii are also significantly smaller than @xmath86 .    under normal conditions ,",
    "the star formation efficiency per dynamical time in clouds of this mass is @xmath87 .",
    "however , the star formation rate is probably somewhat higher here due to the high external pressure ; in principle , the situation is the same as that of an agn outflow compressing pre - existing dense structures in the galaxy , such as the galactic disc @xcite .",
    "if we consider the estimate based on energy balance ( eq . [ eq : sfr_en ] ) as the true limit to the star formation rate , the efficiency then becomes @xmath88 which is @xmath89 since @xmath77 . on scales of individual clumps ,",
    "the star formation efficiency might be significantly higher due to their large density @xcite .",
    "in this case , it would be larger cooling complexes that are affected and dispersed by self - regulating feedback .",
    "the picture described here suggests that most of the gas in a spherically symmetric energy  driven agn outflow is not thermally stable and cools to low temperatures as the outflow proceeds .",
    "both two  body ( bremsstrahlung and metal line ) and atomic hydrogen cooling processes are very efficient and cool the gas to temperatures conducive to molecule formation .",
    "this happens on a timescale @xmath90 myr , which is much lower than the dynamical timescale within a radius @xmath91  kpc , where @xmath46 is the ratio of gas density in the galaxy to the cosmic baryon density .",
    "this cool component is mixed in with much hotter tenuous gas from the shocked central wind , and partially entrained by it .",
    "this picture compares favourably with observations of fast molecular outflows .",
    "@xcite already showed that the predicted velocities ( @xmath92 ) and mass outflow rates ( several @xmath93 ) are in broad agreement with expectations from the energy ",
    "driven phase triggered by the central smbh mass reaching the critical @xmath94 value ( eq . [ eq : msigma ] ) .",
    "our results here refine this picture : we show that most of the outflow appears in molecular form , despite its high velocity @xmath95 . once again",
    ", this is consistent with observations of outflows .",
    "the clumps of molecular gas have much higher densities than their surroundings and are less affected by the ram pressure of the agn wind . as a result , they partially detach from the diffuse outflow and decelerate .",
    "@xcite found the same result in numerical simulations of fragmenting outflows .",
    "in addition , rayleigh - taylor instabilities mean that even the diffuse shocked ism does not expand uniformly , but instead has a spread of velocities below the formal outflow velocity calculated by @xcite .",
    "this explains the fact that observed velocities of molecular outflows are typically lower than the formal @xmath96 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : ve ] ) .",
    "as the outflow progresses , on average , regions closer to the black hole are denser and cooler than regions further away .",
    "this happens due to two reasons : the cooling rate decreases outwards , and the outer regions are shocked later , leaving them less time to cool down .",
    "such a situation is consistent with observations of , which suggest that at least in the molecular outflow of mrk 231 , molecular gas has higher densities in the central regions than in the outskirts .",
    "it is important to note that these calculations assume a spherically symmetric isothermal gas distribution in the galaxy . in a realistic galaxy ,",
    "this assumption breaks down outside a few kpc from the centre .",
    "while this does not preclude the formation of molecular gas in the outflow , the cooling rate may be significantly reduced in the directions perpendicular to the galactic disc plane . in this case",
    ", the molecular outflow would appear more similar to a galactic fountain , with most clumps ejected close to the plane of the disc .",
    "the star formation rate in the outflow would be similarly reduced , and the existing star formation may be easily confused with star formation in the disc due to its location .",
    "@xcite showed that in energy - driven outflows , the density contrast between the shocked wind and the shocked ambient medium is of order @xmath97 .",
    "this configuration leads to formation of strong rt instabilities in the contact discontinuity , which enhance mixing and maintain a constant pressure throughout the outflow ( see section [ sec : shock ] ) .",
    "several authors found that rt instabilities may be suppressed under certain conditions .",
    "@xcite showed that recombination effectively suppresses the instability growth , at least on length scales @xmath98  pc .",
    "however , efficient recombination requires temperatures @xmath99  k and so is irrelevant for the gas immediately behind the shock .",
    "instabilities with wavelengths shorter than the width of the cooling region , i.e. @xmath100  pc ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dcool ] ) are not suppressed by recombination effects .",
    "another way of suppressing rt instabilities is by strong radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "however , as we showed in section [ sec : stability ] , the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure is @xmath101 until almost all of the outflowing gas becomes molecular .",
    "therefore , radiation pressure is also unable to stop rt instability from growing",
    ".    there may be other ways of stabilising the contact discontinuity , for example via magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but even in this case , short wavelength instabilities can grow @xcite , leading to mixing across the discontinuity .",
    "finally , once the shocked outflowing gas becomes gravitationally unstable , the resulting clumpiness allows some of the hot wind to leak out of the bubble , once again enhancing mixing .",
    "the net effect of these instabilities is to maintain pressure equilibrium throughout the outflow . even without the instabilities ,",
    "the pressure varies only by a factor of a few from the contact discontinuity to the forward shock @xcite , so the precise nature of the instabilities is not important to the overall picture of outflow cooling .",
    "another important effect of rt fingers is that they produce a large number of shock fronts , which can accelerate particles to cosmic ray ( cr ) energies .",
    "our model therefore predicts that crs are produced in agn unless all instabilities of the contact discontinuity are efficiently suppressed .",
    "molecular clumps embedded in hot gas are subject to various processes that act to destroy them . here",
    "we briefly review the effects of three processes : cloud evaporation , rayleigh - taylor instabilities and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "the timescale of cloud evaporation can be approximated using the expressions in @xcite .",
    "their equation ( 22 ) , when rescaled appropriately , gives @xmath102 where @xmath103 is clump mass in @xmath104 and @xmath105 its radius in parsecs . in the above expression",
    ", we used the clump mass estimate from eq .",
    "( [ eq : clumpmass ] ) , the hot gas temperature from eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) and estimated the radius from the assumption that the clump density is @xmath106 times the particle density ( eq . [ eq : nshock ] ) .",
    "it appears that in most situations , i.e. where @xmath107 and @xmath108 , large clumps survive for long enough to form a significant number of stars .",
    "however , the clumps should have a range of masses around the calue given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : clumpmass ] ) , and the smaller clumps can evaporate more rapidly .",
    "this echoes the numerical simulations of @xcite , who find clouds with masses of order @xmath109 evaporating due to thermal conduction over @xmath110  myr under similar conditions , although with the wind streaming past the clouds with large velocities .",
    "another aspect which increases the survival time of clumps in our model is their rapid radial motion .",
    "the evaporation timescale scales with the square of the distance , so as the clump moves outward , it is progressively less affected by evaporation .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities can in principle develop at the clump interface , since the clump is much denser than the wind .",
    "several authors have found , however , that in hot environments , hydrogen recombination @xcite and thermal conduction @xcite suppress the growth of these instabilities .",
    "therefore we are confident the rt instabilities do not destroy the clumps rapidly enough to prevent them from being observed at large distances",
    ".    finally , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities can develop and disrupt the clumps , but only if the shear velocity between the clump and the diffuse outflow gas is large . within our model , clumps form from the fast - moving gas , and therefore move with roughly the same velocity , i.e. @xmath111 , so the kh instability growth timescale @xmath112 .",
    "our discussion here is brief , since a more detailed treatment of clump dynamics after formation is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "nevertheless , even if some process destroys the clump soon after formation , the clump gas only adds to the hot outflow .",
    "the hot gas then cools down and forms clumps again , and the system potentially ends up in a cycle of cooling , clump formation , clump destruction and heating , so that there is a large amount of molecular gas present in the outflow at any given time .",
    "there are other signatures of agn outflows in addition to molecular emission lines .",
    "the very high temperature of the wind shock close to the agn should make these objects intrinsically luminous gamma - ray sources .",
    "assuming that the bubble expands spherically with constant velocity @xmath26 , we get the shocked wind temperature @xmath113 at this temperature , a significant fraction of the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation is emitted as gamma - rays .",
    "the number density in the shocked wind gas , assumed constant throughout the bubble volume , is @xmath114 with @xmath115 and assuming that the smbh mass @xmath116 ( eq . [ eq : msigma ] ) .",
    "the total bremsstrahlung luminosity emitted in a bubble with volume @xmath117 is @xmath118 this luminosity is small compared with the total kinetic power of the outflow @xmath119  erg / s .",
    "this suggests that gamma - ray emission might only be strong in the early phases of the energy - driven outflow .",
    "however , the strong shocks we predict also offer another route to producing them , as they can accelerate cosmic ray electrons and produce gamma rays via inverse compton or synchrotron emission . in both cases ,",
    "strong molecular outflows are potentially rewarding targets for future gamma ray observatories .",
    "the cooling shocked outflow produces thermal x - rays . both gamma rays and x - rays",
    "are observed in our galaxy , where two gamma - ray bubbles disposed symmetrically on either side of the galactic plane , surrounded by soft x - ray emission on the edges , were discovered using the _ fermi _ satellite @xcite .",
    "these features may be a local ( but intrinsically much weaker due to low gas fraction ) example of agn feedback @xcite .",
    "we also find that the expected self - regulating star formation rate in an outflow is large , reaching @xmath120  yr@xmath121 or more .",
    "the luminosity of these young stars can outshine the agn itself , leading to the galaxy being classed as a lirg or ulirg .",
    "this misclassification might be one of the reasons why similar large - scale outflows are attributed to driving by stellar feedback .",
    "even if the feedback energy injected by the young stars is larger than the agn contribution , the ultimate cause of the whole process is agn wind .",
    "another reason for attributing outflow driving to starbursts is the fact that the outflows we have considered here can persist for @xmath122  yr after the central agn has turned off @xcite .",
    "therefore , outflows should be detected much more often than the agn that inflated them in the first place .",
    "this opens the possibility that most , if not all , galaxy - wide outflows are ultimately triggered by agn .",
    "this seems particularly likely in cases where the outflow has high velocities , @xmath123  km / s , since starburst - driven winds are unlikely to be capable of reaching such velocities @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we showed that spherically - symmetric energy - driven agn outflows are thermally unstable and rapidly cool down to temperatures below @xmath62  k , freezing out into dense molecular clumps .",
    "this scenario explains the fact that observed agn outflows are mostly composed of molecular gas moving at high velocities .",
    "these findings , together with previous work analysing the structure of such outflows , give the following predictions for outflow visibility :    * the shocked wind bubble emits gamma rays . unfortunately",
    ", the expected luminosity of the whole bubble ( @xmath124  erg / s ) is too low to be detectable with present instruments . *",
    "the hot diffuse outflowing gas creates a soft x - ray envelope around the gamma - ray bubble .",
    "parts of this envelope may be visible close to galactic discs , where the ism density is much larger than elsewhere in the bulge and halo . *",
    "the cold clumps , which account for most of the outflow mass , are observable in molecular lines .",
    "they are unlikely to form in galaxies with depleted diffuse gas content , such as the milky way , but should be common in dense systems .",
    "* star formation in the molecular clumps proceeds at a rate of order @xmath125  yr@xmath121 , enough for its luminosity to exceed the total luminosity of the agn .",
    "* many outflows attributed to star formation may instead be energy - driven by agn .",
    "a direct signature of this would be a central gamma - ray emitting bubble surrounded by an x - ray emitting shell .",
    "since the outflow must be energy - driven this in turn would imply a central black hole mass very close to the @xmath3 value .",
    "such agn  driven outflows should be both faster ( @xmath126  km s@xmath121 ) and more concentrated to the galaxy centre than those driven by starbursts .",
