    "this procedure nearly always resulted in a unique match , and in the few ambiguous cases , the source closest to the irac position was taken as the counterpart . comparing this approach to the likelihood - matching method used for the x - ray data by @xcite results in a discrepancy of less than 1% in our final agn candidate sample . because _",
    "chandra _ s point spread function ( psf ) worsens with increasing off - axis angles ( oaas ) , in matching the irac sources to the x - ray catalog , we checked for sources at large oaas where the possibility of a mismatch due to positional inaccuracies is higher .",
    "the _ chandra _  pointing is wider than the irac field , and therefore many of the sources with the largest oaas do not lie within the shared area .",
    "out of 719 x - ray counterparts , only ten x - ray matches have oaas greater than 9 , and four of these have oaas greater than 10 .",
    "therefore , we are confident of the vast majority of the irac-_chandra _  associations .",
    "in the infrared , the slope of a galaxy sed may be characterized by a power law behavior of flux density with frequency @xmath31 .",
    "agn seds often follow a negative - sloping ( red ) power law , which may arise from either thermal or non - thermal emission originating near the central region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , stellar - dominated sources at low redshift generally exhibit positive ( blue ) irac power - law emission following the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody spectrum . if @xmath32 , the sed of stellar - dominated sources may deviate from a power law because of the 1.6  stellar emission bump , which arises from the minimum in the opacity of the h@xmath33 ion present in stellar atmospheres , but the overall slope is likely to be blue or at least flat unless @xmath34 .    for this paper , we defined a sample of ir - selected agns by choosing sources with seds that follow a power law in the four irac bands from 3.6 to 8.0  ( observed , not rest ) wavelengths .",
    "a good fit was defined by small chi - square such that @xmath35 , i.e. , a source having a true power law sed has a 10% chance of being excluded from the sample by random observational errors .",
    "galaxies fitting a power - law sed were further classified as red or blue .",
    "a limit of @xmath36 was chosen to select our final sample of agns following @xcite , and throughout this paper , we refer to `` red '' power laws as those with @xmath36 , while `` blue '' power laws refer to those with @xmath37 .",

    "the remaining 66% of sources do not fit a power law according to our criterion : 10% have red slopes with best - fit @xmath49 but @xmath50 , and 55% have blue slopes but @xmath50 .",
    "the 489 sources identified in our sample as having red power - law ( pl ) fits are referred to here as pl agns and are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "these sources were selected on the basis of their irac spectral slopes only and therefore should not be biased by x - ray or visible - light agn - like properties . the assumption that these sources are",
    "agns will be justified below .",
    "we also selected a sample of sources fitting a red power law from 3.624  , thereby doubling the baseline used to determine spectral slope .",
    "the vast majority of mips sources ( nearly all of which were detected by irac ) can not be fit to a power law , red or blue . while most of the irac sources are generally brighter toward the blue , the mips sources have much redder mid - ir emission , and only 0.5% are well fit by a blue power law while 16% are blue but poorly fit by a power law .",
    "82% of mips sources are red but poorly fit by a power - law , and finally 2% ( 168 ) of mips sources are well fit by a red power law from 3.6 to 24  .",
    "the predominance of red sources is expected from the lower sensitivity limit of the mips instrument compared to irac : irac sources detected by mips are likely to be red unless they have extremely bright irac flux densities .",
    "the 168 mips sources that fit a red power law are hereafter referred to as the 3.624  power law sample to distinguish them from the pl agn sample that is the main focus of this study .",
    "all but 15 of these 168 sources are in the pl agn sample . of these 15 ,",
    "12 are red in the irac bands but were excluded from the pl agn sample because they do not fit a power law well enough at 3.68  . the other three fit a power law in the irac bands but a blue one with @xmath51 for all three sources .",
    "these three sources barely made the cutoff for a good 3.624  red power - law fit with @xmath52 and the 3.6 to 24  slope @xmath53 .",
    "the distributions of fitted spectral slopes are shown in figure  [ alphahistfig ] .",
    "as shown , pl agns make up only a small fraction of the total number of irac sources ; their median spectral index is @xmath54 .",
    "there is no significant statistical difference between this calculated median slope and the slope of the @xcite median qso sed , which is @xmath55 at irac wavelengths .",
    "narrow - line agns are expected to have steeper slopes than broad - line agns , as their visible and near - ir emission is much more heavily obscured than their mid - ir emission , but there is no evidence of bimodality in the histogram of pl agn slopes .    the 3.624  power law objects do appear to fall into two clear groups .",
    "the majority of them are red throughout the mid - ir with @xmath42 ; these have a median spectral index of @xmath56 .",
    "there is also a small group of sources that fit a blue power law from 3.6 to 24  and cluster at @xmath57 , which is the slope of sources dominated by starlight .",
    "these have colors @xmath58-[8.0])_{\\rm vega } \\approx 0 $ ] , as expected for stars . for most sources ,",
    "there is good agreement in spectral slope between sources well fit by a power law in both 3.68.0  and 3.624  ( see figure  [ alphacompfig ] ) .",
    "the x - ray sources span a wide range of @xmath43 but are overwhelmingly red in their 3.624  colors .",
    "these will be discussed further in  [ xray ] .",
    "the pl agn with the steepest slope has @xmath59 .",
    "this is consistent with the maximum steepness found by other studies and suggests a cutoff of mid - ir sed shape : @xcite found a maximally steep visible - to - ir slope of @xmath60 among their power - law sources , and @xcite found @xmath61 .",
    "the optically faint x - ray sources in the cdfs studied by @xcite had a maximum steepness of @xmath62 , and @xcite found a limit of @xmath63 among a sample of flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "figure  [ alphahistfig ] shows that the pl agns with the steepest spectral indices never fit a power law from 3.624  .",
    "instead the sed turns over somewhere between 8 and 24  , and the actual 24  flux densities of these sources are several times lower than predicted by a simple extension of the irac power law .",
    "agns are generally redder than normal galaxies in the infrared , and many studies have used this fact to select agns via their positions in color - color space . for example , @xcite and @xcite defined separate agn selections by studying luminous type 1 sloan digital sky survey qsos in the _ spitzer _",
    "first look survey and the _ spitzer _  wide - area infrared extragalactic survey , respectively , and @xcite plotted spectroscopically confirmed agns in the botes  field to define their selection region .",
    "power - law selection is similar in principle to the irac color - color methods .",
    "both techniques search for luminous objects where the nuclear activity outshines light from the host galaxy in the irac bands , which sample the sed between the stellar emission expected at visible wavelengths and the dust emission at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "however , the power - law selection is much stricter , requiring in effect three color criteria rather than two for selection of agn candidates . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ lacyfig ] shows our pl agn sample on the color - color plots used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of the pl agns are contained within the lacy - defined wedge .",
    "however , the selection used by @xcite is quite broad ; the wedge selects 60% of the entire irac parent sample .",
    "the wedge also contains 80% of the x - ray sources , but the x - ray sources comprise only 8% of the total sources in the agn region .",
    "even if the irac catalog is truncated to retain only sources that exceed the flux density limits of @xcite , 40% of the irac general population is contained within the agn region , though the x - ray detection rate goes up to @xmath640% .",
    "the @xcite selection is less inclusive , containing just 18% of the irac sample but 96% of our pl agns .",
    "fifty percent of the x - ray sources are contained by the wedge , and the x - ray detection rate within the wedge is 17% .",
    "the x - ray sources overall show a wide range of colors and do not appear to lie within any well - contained region of color - color space . @xcite and @xcite similarly found that no ir color selection method can reliably select all agns while avoiding the normal galaxy population .",
    "though color selections detect many low - luminosity agns due to the broadness of the criteria , the depth of the irac data is important .",
    "the egs field , with its much deeper irac data , probes different redshift regimes than the shallow fields studied by @xcite , who considered sources at @xmath64 , and by @xcite , whose sample was mostly sensitive to galaxies at @xmath65 .",
    "the results of previous color - color agn selection studies have been efficient and reliable in part because they focused on low redshift regimes .",
    "in contrast , at the higher redshifts typical of our study , many non - agns migrate into the agn color selection wedge .",
    "@xcite found that while agn sed templates stay within the agn selection wedges at all redshifts , starburst and normal galaxy templates have colors outside the agn wedges at low redshift , but the colors migrate into the agn wedge at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite similarly found that star - forming templates enter the selection wedges both at low and high redshifts , though they avoid the locus carved out by the power - law selection ( see figure  6 of @xcite or figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the templates suggest that a high degree of stellar contamination is unavoidable when the color selection technique is applied to deeper samples .",
    "contamination can be reduced by restricting the sample to relatively high 24  flux densities , but @xcite found that even for @xmath66  mjy , half of the color - selected sources in their sample can not be confidently identified as agns .",
    "power - law selection is a much more reliable method of finding agns : most of the secure agn identifications among the color - selected galaxies in the goods - s field were contained in the power - law sample @xcite .",
    "the expectation from templates is confirmed by the egs irac data .",
    "figure  [ zevolfig ] shows the evolution of irac colors for sources with and without measured redshifts . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the 6.2  and 7.7  pah features can still dominate the 8.0  -band emission , and the plot is largely populated by sources with roughly constant blue @xmath68 colors but spanning a wide range of red @xmath69 colors .",
    "these are likely to be nearby , stellar - dominated galaxies with strong aromatic emission redshifting through the 8  band . at intermediate redshifts @xmath70 , sources migrate closer to the agn region of the color - color plot as the k - correction shifts objects towards the red . at @xmath71 ,",
    "nearly every object has colors consistent with the agn wedge .",
    "thus , though we can not assess starburst contamination at high redshifts due to the biases inherent in our redshift survey ( see  [ redshift ] ) , we reiterate the need for caution to avoid contamination from star - forming galaxies in using irac color - color selection of agns .",
    "we also caution that the color changes with redshift seen in figure  [ zevolfig ] should not be interpreted as population evolution because the irac bands sample different rest wavelengths at each redshift .",
    "another technique for finding agns is to select on very red infrared - to - visible or infrared - to - uv color ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique has principally been applied to find x - ray - faint ( possibly compton - thick ) agns . adopting the approach of @xcite selects 89 sources in the egs with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74  @xmath14jy .",
    "only two of these fit a red irac power - law .",
    "the nature of the `` ir - excess '' selection is to choose optically faint sources , @xmath75  mag , and as a result only one of the 89 ir - excess sources in the egs has a spectroscopic redshift ( with @xmath76 ) . though the majority of these galaxies can not be fit to either a red or blue power - law , @xmath675% have blueward - sloping seds .",
    "@xcite found a similar result for ir - excess galaxies , at least for @xmath77  mjy : most have seds containing a stellar emission component .",
    "thus at least a major portion of the ir light in ir - excess - selected objects is likely to be starlight , even if an agn is also present .",
    "little contamination is expected from stellar - dominated sources in our pl agn sample .",
    "systems with infrared emission dominated by star formation and also galaxies with high levels of starlight from an older stellar population show curvature in their seds and thus will not enter the pl agn sample .",
    "as shown below , the multiwavelength properties of the pl agn sample also point to strong nuclear activity .",
    "the red irac colors of the pl agns are unlikely to arise from pah emission in the 8  band ; such emission would not produce an overall power law sed .",
    "furthermore , of the sources with redshifts (  [ redshift ] ) , only four have @xmath78 , and none has @xmath67 . for higher redshifts that characterize the bulk of the pl agns , the strong pah features are outside the irac bands .",
    "while the pl agns may have stellar emission at some level  even enough to be a major component of the bolometric luminosity  it should not dominate the light observed at irac wavelengths .",
    "pl agn seds generally follow agn templates with no evidence of stellar bumps , but an attempt to model the uv - mir seds of the pl agns more precisely was inconclusive .",
    "unfortunately , pl agns seds offer little information because of their lack of spectral features . the possibility that some objects in the pl agn sample are really starbursts can not be directly tested because , if they are starbursts , they must have photometric redshifts @xmath79 , while spectroscopic measurements at these high redshifts are limited to agns (  [ redshift ] ) . modeling the uv  mir seds of x - ray undetected",
    "pl agns is particularly difficult because most of these sources have very low or undetected visible flux densities .",
    "however , our x - ray stacking analysis (  [ stacking ] ) demonstrates that these sources have hard x - ray emission and are likely to be obscured agns .",
    "we also studied the sed templates for a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) and an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) made from average composite fits of observed lirgs and ulirgs @xcite .",
    "an irac power - law shape can not be obtained simply by redshifting the ( u)lirg sed templates we tried to the maximum redshifts ( @xmath80 ) that we observe .",
    "@xcite suggested that cool ulirgs at @xmath81 and with @xmath82 could contaminate a power - law agn sample , but the sed templates in their figure  11 show curvature resulting from the 1.6  stellar bump in the irac wavelength range .",
    "the stellar bump should exist whenever a substantial fraction of the rest 1.6  light comes from evolved stars , and its absence ( by definition ) in our pl agn sample should eliminate most if not all cool ulirgs .",
    "more recently , @xcite have presented theoretical models in which reddened starlight from a young population plus an agn component can exhibit a power law sed during brief phases of a merger .",

    "the multiwavelength data on the pl agn sample also suggest little contamination .",
    "redshifts and thus luminosities for any star - forming galaxies contaminating the pl agn sample would have to be very high .",

    "part of the problem is that the comparatively deep irac data probe higher redshifts than the typical redshift of the spectroscopy or the x - ray data .",
    "another problem is that the wavelength range of the deep2 observations was chosen to measure galaxies with @xmath85 , and at higher redshifts , typical galaxies show no spectral features observable by deep2.3727  [ ] doublet shifts out of the deep2 spectral coverage for @xmath86 . ]",
    "figure  [ zhistfig ] shows that nearly all objects that have spectroscopic redshifts @xmath71.4 are pl agns .",
    "redshifts for these sources come from ultraviolet lines that are prominent in agns but not in normal galaxies",
    ". furthermore , to have been targeted at all for redshift measurement , galaxies at such high redshifts must be extremely luminous , and such high luminosities in the rest ultraviolet ( observed @xmath22 for deep2 selection ) are most easily provided by agns and moreover _ unobscured _ agns .",
    "indeed , of 26 pl agns with deep2 spectra , for the rest ] 15 show strong lines and are classified `` agn . ''",
    "the automated classifier called the remaining 11 `` galaxy , '' but in fact all 11 have emission lines , and at least four have broad lines . only for three objects are broad lines clearly absent , and the largest redshift for any of these is @xmath87 . for the hectospec redshifts , the target selection mentioned above forces most of the sample to be agns , and as expected @xmath790% of this group was classified that way .",

    "taking the strong selection effects into account , it is unsurprising that virtually all of the sources observed to have high redshifts are agns .",
    "pl agns for which measured redshifts exist tend to have much higher redshifts than the irac parent population .",
    "the general population of irac sources in the deep2 redshift survey has a median @xmath89 , and the sources observed with hectospec have median @xmath90 .",
    "the combined redshift sample has a median @xmath91 .",

    "the median redshift of these sources is 1.6 , and the maximum is 3.5 .",
    "the pl agn redshifts are also significantly higher than the median @xmath92 for irac sources with x - ray detections .",

    "the median redshift for these sources is again high at @xmath93 .    though the selection effects explain why all the sources with measured high redshifts are agns , it is interesting that so many of the spectroscopic high-@xmath94 agns are identifiable as agns via their mid - ir properties . in figure",
    "[ lacyfig ] , for example , x - ray agns exhibit a wide range of mid - ir colors , yet figure  [ zevolfig ] shows that all the agns with high measured redshifts are confined within a narrow color range .",
    "the reason is likely to be that at high redshift , agns are seen and selected for spectroscopy only if they are luminous , and in that case , the power law component is likely to dominate the sed .",
    "the seds of pl agns generally do not exhibit the spectral behaviors typical of stellar systems but tend to resemble type  1 agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * who fit template seds to irac / x - ray agns in the egs ) . to compare the sed shapes , figure  [ allsedfig ] shows the seds for a sample of randomly selected sources from the general irac population in every category of power - law fit .",
    "there are 1156 sources that have red - sloping seds not fitting a power law ; these comprise 10% of the total irac population ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",

    "the majority of these sources are poorly fit to a red power - law because their 4.5 and 5.8  flux densities are lower than what a power - law from 3.6@xmath978.0  would predict .",
    "a plausible explanation for such seds is starlight emission , possibly heavily reddened , at 3.6  , thermal dust or agn emission at 8  ( possibly including pah emission for low - redshift galaxies ) , and an sed minimum between these wavelengths where neither component emits strongly .",
    "such an sed is typical of nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or galaxies with starlight contributing most of the light at 3.6  but an agn dominating at 8  ( e.g. , ngc  3079 or 4826  * ? ? ?",
    "thus this group is likely comprised of a mix of relatively low - redshift , starlight - dominated galaxies and agns whose ir signatures are diluted or veiled by starlight .",
    "all of the blue sources ( 85% of the irac sample ) show a broad emission peak , typically reaching its maximum near 12  .",

    "for the 27% of the group with measured redshifts , the mean redshift is 0.73 ; a range of 0 to 1.5 is consistent with the wavelengths of sed peaks in the group .",

    "pl agns with x - ray counterparts tend to have higher flux densities in all wavebands than pl agns that are not x - ray sources .",
    "in particular , the x - ray sources are much more likely to have corresponding visible light detections .",
    "( see figure  [ xraysedfig ] and  [ optical ] . )",
    "the greater rate of visible detections makes x - ray - detected pl agns easier to measure spectroscopically than pl agns lacking x - ray counterparts , and @xmath109 of the x - ray detected pl agns ( 51 sources ) have spectroscopic redshifts .",

    "these have a median @xmath111 , but such a small and likely biased sample can not yield firm conclusions .",
    "the x - ray - detected pl agns were specifically targeted by our mmt redshift survey , and therefore at least part of the higher redshift detection rate for those sources is a selection effect , but the difference in fluxes is real .",
    "the higher fluxes for x - ray sources must be due to some combination of smaller distances , lower obscurations , and/or higher intrinsic luminosities .",
    "for example , the process that fuels x - rays might also produce visible light .",
    "the overall similarity of the average seds ( fig .",
    "[ xraysedfig ] ) tends to suggest that there is little differential obscuration _ affecting the infrared emission _",
    ", though the fact that observed seds fall below the agn template in the visible and ultraviolet suggests that obscuration is present in both classes .",
    "however , infrared slopes do not seem to predict x - ray obscuration (  [ hr ] ) , and stacking of undetected sources ( see  [ stacking ] ) suggests that differential obscuration is at least part of the story .",
    "nevertheless , greater distance could also be important despite the few available redshifts being low .",

    "yields significant detections in both the soft and hard bands at a level @xmath710@xmath19 .",
    "the stacked soft band flux is @xmath112  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath2 , and the stacked hard band flux is @xmath113  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath2 .",
    "these values are about @xmath109 to @xmath114 of the thresholds for individual detection . in order to ensure that the stacked signal is not due to an unequal contribution from a few x - ray sources that just missed being included in the aegis - x catalog , we stacked again after removing the weakly - detected x - ray sources .",
    "there is still x - ray emission at @xmath115 above background : soft band flux @xmath116  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath2  and hard band flux @xmath117  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus the stacked emission appears to be representative of the undetected population rather than dominated by a few moderately bright x - ray sources , consistent with results in fields with much deeper x - ray data @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the stacked signal is relatively hard with @xmath118 .",
    "after weakly - detected sources are removed , the spectral slope of the remaining stack is likewise hard with @xmath119 .",
    "assuming the average stacked source has @xmath120 ( equal to the median redshift of the pl agn sample ) , the hardness ratio can be used to estimate obscuration by calculating column densities using the pimms tool available from ciao ( v3.9b , * ? ? ?",
    "the result is @xmath121  @xmath4 ( assuming a power - law model with intrinsic @xmath122 ) , implying a high but not compton - thick level of obscuration .",
    "the hardness ratio is also consistent with a nearly flat x - ray spectrum , @xmath123 , which can be interpreted as evidence for a large fraction of compton - thick agns among the x - ray - undetected pl sources . in this picture , the direct emission from the agn is fully absorbed , and the observed x - rays come from reflection off the torus or the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the reflected component has a very flat spectrum , @xmath124 @xcite , and does not provide any information about the actual @xmath125 , just that the source is likely to be compton - thick .",
    "the hr alone can not discriminate between these possibilities or in general between compton - thick or compton - thin obscuration .",
    "moreover , sources below but close to the compton - thick limit may still be reflection - dominated in the _ chandra _ and xmm bands ( depending on redshift ) , further complicating the interpretation .",
    "whatever the explanation for the hard spectrum may be , the hardness does nt depend on whether or not the weakly - detected sources are included in the stacking .    one possible way to discriminate between compton - thick and compton - thin obscuration is to compare hard x - ray and infrared fluxes .",
    "these two quantities are well correlated for agns with low to moderate obscuration as first recognized by @xcite and studied in more detail by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ antonisfig ] shows the comparison for the pl agn sample .",
    "the x - ray - detected objects fall within or near the @xcite relation , even without correcting the x - ray fluxes for any absorption .",
    "in contrast , the stacking signal for the x - ray undetected pl agns is more than 100 times fainter than the relation , consistent with compton - thick absorption .",
    "stacking gives no information about individual objects , but if some have relatively large x - ray fluxes and are therefore not compton - thick , the rest must have even smaller fluxes and be further into the compton - thick zone .",
    "thus it seems likely that many , perhaps a majority , of the x - ray - undetected pl agns suffer compton - thick obscuration .",
    "@xcite , using a different selection of infrared sources , also found large numbers of x - ray - undetected , compton - thick agns .",
    "another issue is the depth of the x - ray coverage .",
    "@xcite conducted an x - ray stacking analysis of irac sources in the cdf - n , which has even deeper irac data than the egs .",
    "they found that color - selected sources in the @xcite agn wedge produce a soft spectrum consistent with @xmath126 , whereas power - law sources produce a harder signal ( @xmath127 ) as expected of agns .",
    "our stacking analysis (  [ stacking ] ) shows that in the egs , sources in the @xcite - defined wedge , sources in the @xcite wedge , and pl agns all have similar stacked fluxes and are all relatively hard with @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 respectively.20% in the @xcite wedge are pl agns .",
    "[ color ] for other statistics on the wedge populations . ]",
    "the difference in results is likely to be due to x - ray depth of fields : more of the faint x - ray sources are detected by the very deep exposures of the cdf - n and excluded from the stacking analysis , whereas in the shallower egs , sources at similar x - ray fluxes remain undetected and therefore are included in the stacked flux .",
    "these results suggest that many of the x - ray - undetected sources in the lacy and stern selection in the egs _ would _ be detected with 2  ms x - ray data .",
    "however , the soft spectra of the fainter x - ray sources in the cdf - n suggests that the color - wedge - selected samples at egs - like depths have a high rate of contamination from ulirgs and other star - forming galaxies , as expected from the behavior of template colors with redshift (  [ color ] ) .",
    "pl agns represent 22% of the x - ray sources in the egs .",
    "this is much higher than the 4% pl agns in the general irac parent sample , but sources with red irac power law seds are still a minority of x - ray objects . relaxing the power - law definition to @xmath131 and @xmath132 increases the fraction to 40% , as found by @xcite with that definition .",
    "a comparable selection rate was also found by @xcite among their sample of x - ray sources with @xmath133 erg  s@xmath2  in the ecdfs using the definition @xmath132 and @xmath134 . because most x - ray sources in the egs are expected to be agns , requiring a red irac power - law sed will not identify even a majority of active nuclei .    the respective x - ray and pl agn detection fractions can be estimated under the assumption that the two methods are observing a single agn population and that detection by each method is _ independent _ of the other .",
    "each method then detects a fixed fraction of the population , and the product of the detection fractions times the number in the population is the 159 x - ray - detected pl agns .",
    "the resulting detection fractions are 0.33 for x - ray , 0.22 for pl agns , and the population size is 2200 objects .",
    "the assumption of a single population is probably wrong because the egs infrared observations reach higher redshifts than the x - ray observations .",
    "the effect of this error is that the x - ray population is likely to be smaller and detection fraction larger than estimated above .",
    "perfect independence of detection is also doubtful , despite the most likely reasons for non - detection being entirely different for the two methods ( extinction for the x - rays , additional contaminating radiation sources for the infrared ) , because higher luminosity sources are more likely both to overcome extinction and to outshine contaminating sources .",
    "the effect of this error is that both detection fractions are overestimated and the overall population size is underestimated .",
    "thus the specific numbers above are at best rough estimates , but the method is still useful for comparing agn populations found by different surveys .",
    "our study finds fewer x - ray sources with blue power law seds than previous studies have , but this is at least partly because our power law selection is more stringent .",
    "according to our criteria , only 19% of x - ray sources fit a blue power law in the irac bands . relaxing the criteria to those used by @xcite increases the fraction to 23% , but this is still much smaller than the 38% found by @xcite the discrepancy is mostly because the observational error bars at 3.6 and 4.5  are smaller in the final catalog @xcite used here than in the earlier catalog used by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found 59% of x - ray counterparts fit a blue power law in the irac bands , but they included sources with detection significance as low as 3@xmath19 instead of the 5@xmath19 we required . with large photometric error bars , a power law will adequately fit many more sources . indeed",
    "@xcite found 97% of x - ray sources and 94% of all irac sources fit a power law versus our values of 41% and 34% respectively .",
    "regardless of the exact numbers , the presence of x - ray sources among this group means that a blue sed , even one closely fitting a power law in the irac bands , does not rule out the presence of strong nuclear activity .    requiring a power law fit from 3.624  yields an even smaller percentage of x - ray objects : only 10% of sources with 24  and x - ray detections fit a red power - law from 3.6 to 24  ( using our original cut of @xmath35 and @xmath135 ) .",
    "however , while the x - ray sources with irac power laws are roughly evenly divided between red and blue power - law sources , x - ray sources that fit a 3.624  power law are virtually all red .",
    "( see figure  [ alphacompfig ] . ) of the 70 3.624  power - law sources with x - ray counterparts , only 5 exhibited the blue power laws indicative of stellar emission .",
    "this is hardly surprising given the detection limits of the surveys ; very few sources will be detectable at 24  unless the 24-  flux density is considerably larger than the 8-  flux density .",
    "rest - frame luminosity is a useful diagnostic of the power source for an x - ray - emitting galaxy @xcite .",
    "rest - frame hard band ( 210  kev ) x - ray luminosities were calculated for the 47 sources with hard band detections and spectroscopic redshifts using @xmath136  erg  s@xmath2 , where @xmath137 is the luminosity distance calculated from equation  1 of @xcite , and @xmath138 is the hard band flux in units of erg  @xmath4  s@xmath2 .",
    "most of these spectroscopically confirmed sources appear to be obscured but not compton thick ( see  [ hr ] and fig .",

    "this is further confirmation that our sample is not likely to be dominated by star - formation , as @xmath141 values of local starburst systems typically lie below @xmath142 erg  s@xmath2@xcite .",
    "as expected @xcite , virtually all of the highest x - ray luminosity sources are pl agns ( see figure  [ lxhistfig ] ) , and 35 out of the 50 sources with @xmath143  erg  s@xmath2  are pl agns . of the 15 exceptions , 12 have red - sloping irac seds but were excluded by our goodness - of - fit criteria .",
    "one source was well fit to a blue power law with @xmath144 , and two sources were poorly fit to a blue power law with @xmath145 .",

    "pl agns having x - ray luminosities below the break value are not excluded by low x - ray fluxes ( as shown by the stacking analysis ) but rather by the absence of redshifts .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity for galaxies detected as pl agns suggests that the pl agns without x - ray counterparts are either very distant compared to the sources with x - ray detections or else heavily obscured .",
    "though the physical interpretation behind the break in the luminosity function is still unclear , the power - law selection may be finding an agn population that is distinct from the sub-@xmath147 x - ray galaxies .",
    "the sub-@xmath147 x - ray population may include agns with little dust near the nucleus or different accretion modes ( and hence lower intrinsic near - ir emission ) or agns veiled by emission from the host galaxy ( and hence not identified as an agn by the near - ir sed ) .",
    "veiling by the host galaxy is probably at least part of the reason pl agns with low luminosities are uncommon @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the sources with irac and x - ray detections and spectroscopic redshifts but that are not pl agns show much weaker correlation between ir and x - rays . indeed , the 3.6  flux for this sample is essentially constant , suggesting that in the non - pl agn sources , 3.6  emission arises from a source unrelated to the central engine .",

    "<S> this paper analyzes a sample of 489 _ spitzer_/irac sources in the extended groth strip whose spectral energy distributions fit a red power law from 3.6 to 8.0  . </S>",
    "<S> the median for sources with known redshift is @xmath0 . though all or nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei , only 33% were detected in the egs x - ray survey ( aegis - x ) using 200  ks _ chandra _  observations . </S>",
    "<S> the detected sources are x - ray luminous with @xmath1 erg  s@xmath2 and moderately to heavily obscured with @xmath3  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> stacking the x - ray - undetected sample members yields a statistically significant x - ray signal , suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured than sources with x - ray detections . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of x - ray to mid - infrared fluxes suggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in x - rays are obscured at the compton - thick level , in contrast to the x - ray - detected sources , all of which appear to be compton - thin . for the x - ray - detected power - law sources with redshifts , an x - ray luminosity @xmath5  erg  s@xmath2 marks a transition between low - luminosity , blue sources dominated by the host galaxy to high - luminosity , red power - law sources dominated by nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray - to - optical ratios , infrared variability , and 24  properties of the sample are consistent with the identification of infrared power - law sources as active nuclei , but a rough estimate is that only 22% of agns are selected by the power law criteria . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the power - law selection technique and various irac color criteria for identifying agns confirms that high - redshift samples selected via simple irac colors may be heavily contaminated by starlight - dominated objects . </S>"
