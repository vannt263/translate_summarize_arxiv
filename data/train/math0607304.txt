    "the function @xmath12 is called in that case a _ quasi - metric _ , or more specifically , a @xmath13-quasi - metric .",
    "the property ( 3 ) is a generalized version of the _ ultra - metric _ triangle inequality ( the case @xmath14 ) .",
    "[ remark : powermetric ] if @xmath15 is a metric space , then @xmath16 is a @xmath13-quasi - metric for @xmath17 . in general @xmath18 is not a metric on @xmath0 for @xmath19 . but @xmath18 is still a @xmath20-quasi - metric .",
    "we are interested in the question how to obtain a metric on @xmath0 .",
    "our personal motivation comes from the study of the boundary at infinity of a gromov hyperbolic space , where this question arises naturally , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the problem was studied by frink in the interesting paper @xcite .",
    "the motivation of frink was to obtain suitable condition for a topological space to be metrizable .",
    "frink used a natural approach , which we call the _ chain approach _ to obtain a metric on @xmath0 .",
    "he showed that this appraoch works and gives a metric if the space @xmath21 satisfies the axioms ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) from above and instead of ( 3 ) the _ weak triangle inequality _",
    "( 3 ) if @xmath22 and @xmath23 then @xmath24 .    observe that ( 3 ) is equivalent to ( 3 ) with constant @xmath17 but the formulation as a weak triangle inequality points out that the constant @xmath17 playes a special role .    in this short note",
    "we give a review of frinks approach and show that there exists a `` natural '' counterexample to the chain approach in case that the weak triangle inequality ( 3 ) is not satisfied .",
    "i am grateful to urs lang for showing me the paper of frink and to tobias strubel for discussions about quasimetric spaces .",
    "let @xmath21 be a quasimetric space .",
    "we want to obtain a metric on @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath12 satisfies all axioms of a metric space except the triangle inequality , the following approach is very natural .",
    "define a map @xmath25 , @xmath26 where the infimum is taken over all sequences @xmath27 in @xmath0 . by definition @xmath16 satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "we call this approach to the triangle inequality the _ chain approach_. the problem with the chain approach is that @xmath28 could be @xmath29 for different points @xmath30 and axiom ( 1 ) is not longer satisfied for @xmath15 .",
    "this chain approach is due to frink , who realized that the approach works if the space @xmath21 satisfies the axioms ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) from above . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we give a proof of frink s result .",
    "[ thm : chainconstract ] let @xmath12 be a @xmath13-quasi - metric on a set @xmath0 with @xmath31 .",
    "then , the chain construction applied to @xmath12 yields a metric @xmath16 with @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , @xmath16 is nonnegative , symmetric , satisfies the triangle inequality and @xmath33 .",
    "we prove by induction over the length of sequences @xmath34 , @xmath35 , that @xmath36 for @xmath37 , this follows from the triangle inequality ( 3 ) for @xmath12 .",
    "assume that ( [ eqn : qmetricest ] ) holds true for all sequences of length @xmath38 , and suppose that @xmath35 .",
    "given @xmath39 , we let @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and note that @xmath42 .    because @xmath43 , there is a maximal @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",

    "assume now that @xmath47 .",

    "it follows that @xmath39 and thus by the inductive assumption @xmath50 on the other hand , @xmath51 because @xmath31 , a contradiction .",
    "now , it follows from ( [ eqn : qmetricest ] ) that @xmath52 , hence , @xmath16 is a metric as required .",
    "in this section we construct for any given @xmath53 a quasimetric space @xmath21 such that the chain approach does not lead to a metric space and the following holds : for every triple of points @xmath54 we have @xmath55.\\ ] ]    let therefore @xmath56 be a given constant .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of dyadic rational of the interval @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath0 is the disjoint union of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 , we say that the level of @xmath3 is @xmath64 and write @xmath65 . for the following construction",
    "it is useful to see @xmath0 embedded by @xmath66 as a discrete subset of the plane .",
    "let @xmath67 with @xmath68 , then we define the right and the left neighbors @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we see that @xmath71 and clearly @xmath72 , where we take the usual ordering induced by the reals .",
    "given @xmath73 with @xmath74 we consider the _",
    "right path _ @xmath75 and the left path @xmath76 .",
    "note that after a finite number of steps the right path always ends at @xmath77 and the left path always ends at @xmath29 .",
    "fact 1 : consider for an arbitry @xmath78 the levels of the vertices on the right and on the left path , i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then all intermediate levels @xmath64 with @xmath81 occur exactly once ( either on the right or on the left path ) .",
    "e.g. consider @xmath82 which is of level @xmath83 .",
    "the left path is @xmath84 ( containig the intermediate levels @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , the right path is @xmath87 ( containing the remaining intermediate levels @xmath88 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "this fact can be verified by looking to the dyadic expansion of @xmath3 , e.g. @xmath89 .",
    "note that the dyadic expression of @xmath90 is obtained from the one of @xmath3 by removing the last @xmath77 in this expression , i.e. @xmath91 . the dyadic expression of @xmath92 is obtained by removing the last consequetive sequence of @xmath77 s and putting a @xmath77 instead of the @xmath29 in the last entry before the sequence , e.g @xmath93 .",
    "therefore the levels of the left path ( resp . of the left path ) correspond to the places with a @xmath77 ( resp . with a @xmath29 ) in the dyadic expansion .",
    "fact 2 : let @xmath94 be a point on the left path and @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 be the integer , such that @xmath97 is the first point on the right path with @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .",
    "a corresponding statements holds for points on the right path .",
    "this fact can also be verified by looking to the dyadic expension .",
    "we consider the graph whose vertex set is @xmath0 , and the edges are given by the pairs @xmath100 , where the @xmath73 are points with level @xmath101 .",
    "one can visualize this graph nicely , if we use the realization of @xmath0 in the plane described above . in this picture",
    "we can see the edges as line intervalls and the graph is planar . in this picture",
    "the left path from a point @xmath3 with @xmath74 can be viewed as the graph of a piecewise linear function defined on the interval @xmath102 $ ] ( here @xmath103 $ ] ) and the the right path as the graph of a piecewise linear function on @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the union of these two paths form a `` tent '' in this picture .          to every edge in this graph we associate a length . to the edge @xmath105 we associate the length @xmath77 , and to an edge of the type @xmath106 and @xmath107 we associate the length @xmath108 .",
    "now we define the quasimetric @xmath12 .",
    "first set @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 be points such that @xmath30 is not the pair @xmath111 .",
    "let us assume @xmath112 .",
    "then we consider the right path @xmath113 starting from @xmath3 , and the left path @xmath114 starting from @xmath9 . then the properties from above imply that these two paths intersect at a unique point @xmath115 .",
    "then we obtain a v - shaped path @xmath116 formed by edges from our graph from @xmath3 to @xmath9 .",
    "we define @xmath117 to be the sum of the lengths of the edges of this path .",
    "the main point is now to show that @xmath12 is a quasi - metric space .",
    "before we prove this , we show that the chain approach does not give a metric .",
    "therefore consider for any integer @xmath64 the chain @xmath118 . by our definition @xmath119 .",
    "thus the length of the chain is @xmath120 which converges to @xmath29 since @xmath121 .        to obtain this fact consider the tent formed by the left path from @xmath29 to @xmath3 and the right path from @xmath3 to @xmath77 and consider the levels of the points on this path .",
    "by fact 1 all intermediate levels occur exactly once .",
    "thus the formula comes immediately from the definition of @xmath12 .",
    "note that the @xmath124 comes from the two edges starting at the top point @xmath3 of the tent .",
    "consider the v - shaped path from @xmath129 to @xmath131 , let @xmath148 be the `` lowest '' point on this path . by symmetry of the whole argument",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath149 . now",
    "( using fact 3 ) we see that the left path staring at @xmath130 will intersect the right path starting in @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath150 be the intersection point .",
    "let @xmath151 be the first point , where the right path starting at @xmath130 coincides with the right path starting at @xmath129 .",
    "fact 3 implies that @xmath152 . note that now the triangle @xmath153 is a special triangle as discussed above .",
