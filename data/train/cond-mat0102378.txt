    "according to the evolutionary theory of aging the ultimate cause of senescence is the declining force of natural selection with age @xcite . from 1950s to 1980s",
    ", this idea has been formulated in a progressively more explicit and formal way , culminating in the mathematical treatment of charlesworth @xcite .",
    "several different genetic mechanisms may be involved in this lack of selection pressure at old ages , but the two major alternative population genetic mechanisms are the antagonistic pleiotropy and the mutation - accumulation mechanism .",
    "pleiotropic genes are those that have different effects on fitness at different ages .",
    "the antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism @xcite proposes that ageing is caused by pleiotropic genes that have opposite effects at young and old ages , that is , genes that confer some advantage during the period of maximum reproductive probability , at the expenses of some disadvantage or declining vigor late in life .",
    "an example is the accumulation of calcium to build up bones first , and the appearence of arteriosclerosis later .",
    "the mutation - accumulation mechanism @xcite proposes that ageing is caused by the accumulation of deleterious alleles having effects that appear only at old ages , when selection pressure is already weak , and in this way may remain in the population , being transmitted from parents to offspring .",
    "after the analytically treated mathematical model of partridge and barton in 1993 @xcite , a continuous flow of monte carlo simulations of ageing started ( for a review see @xcite ) . the bit - string penna model of life history was published in 1995 @xcite and is now by far the most widely used monte carlo simulation technique to predict many of the features related to ageing ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the mutation - accumulation theory and gives that the probability to die within the next year increases exponentially with age , in agreement with the 19th century empirical gompertz law for human mortality .    in this paper",
    "we combine the penna model with an antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism .",
    "however , this antagonistic pleiotropy does not work in the usual way explained above , since it does not give any advantage at young ages . on the contrary",
    ", it gives a disadvantage before reproduction age and some advantage at old ages .",
    "our biological motivation is the existence of a rather curious gene involved in the cholesterol transportation by the blood stream @xcite",
    ". this gene can be found in three different forms , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the allele @xmath2 seems to be the most dangerous one : those who carry it have a high cholesterol level and a high probability of suffering from heart diseases and also alzheimer .",
    "in contrast , the allele @xmath0 seems to be relatively beneficial : it is associated to low levels of cholesterol and a low incidence of alzheimer .",
    "the allele @xmath1 has an intermediate influence concerning these diseases .",
    "surprisingly , studies in different populations have shown that the form @xmath1 is by far the most common one , followed by the dangerous form @xmath2 .",
    "the less common form is the beneficial one , @xmath3 .",
    "since deleterious mutations that may affect the individuals at young ages are generally eliminated from the population , the persistence of the allelic form @xmath4 may be related to some antagonistic effect .",
    "combinations of the usual antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism with the penna model can be found in @xcite ; simple pleiotropy , understood as a two - fold effect of a harmfully mutated gene , has also been recently introduced into the model in order to show the advantages of sexual reproduction @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the traditional sexual version of the penna model ; the readers already familiar with the model can skip this section . in section 3",
    "we present our pleiotropy mechanism and results , and in section 4 , our conclusions .",
    "in the sexual version of the model , each individual of a population is represented by a `` chronological genome '' that consists of two bit - strings ( diploid ) of 32 bits ( zeroes and ones ) .",
    "these two strings are read in parallel , which means that each position is associated to two bits ( alleles ) .",
    "one time step corresponds to reading a new bit position in all genomes .",
    "the first position contains the information about the individual s first period of life , the second one about the second period and so on .",
    "each individual can live at most for 32 periods , each period corresponding to one day , week or year depending on the species .",
    "genetic defects ( harmful mutations ) are represented by bits 1 and healthy genes by bits 0 .",
    "homozygous loci ( positions ) are those with two equal alleles ( bits ) .",
    "heterozygous loci are those corresponding to different alleles , meaning that the individual inherited opposite informations , 0 and 1 , from each parent .",
    "if an individual has two bits 1 ( homozygous ) at the third position , for instance , it starts to suffer the effects of a genetic defect at its third period of life .",
    "if it is an homozygous position with two bits zero , no disease appears at that age .",
    "if the individual is heterozygous in some position , it will become sick only if the mutation at this position has a dominant effect .",
    "six of the 32 bits positions are randomly chosen , at the beginning of the simulation , where the alleles 1 are dominant ; in the remaining 26 positions this allele is recessive .",
    "these dominant positions are the same for all individuals and kept fix during the whole process . when the number of accumulated diseases of any individual reaches a threshold value @xmath5 , the individual dies .",
    "if a female succeeds in surviving until the minimum reproduction age @xmath6 , it generates , with probability 0.5 , one offspring every period until death .",
    "the female randomly chooses a male to mate , with age also greater or equal to @xmath6 .",
    "the offspring genome is constructed from the parents ones ; first the strings of the mother are randomly crossed , and a female gamete ( one string of 32 bits ) is produced .",
    "@xmath7 deleterious mutations are then randomly introduced .",
    "the same process occurs with the father s genome ( with @xmath8 mutations ) , and the union of the two remaining gametes form the new genome .",
    "the sex of the baby is randomly chosen , each one with probability @xmath9 .",
    "deleterious mutation means that if the randomly chosen bit of the parent s gamete is equal to 1 , it remains 1 in the offspring genome , but if it is equal to zero in the parent s gamete , it is set to 1 in the baby genome .",
    "the most important characteristic of this dynamics is that the bits 1 accumulate , after many generations , at the end part of the genomes , that is , after the minimum reproduction age @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason ageing appears : the survival probabilities per period decrease with age , in agreement with the mutation accumulation hypothesis and reality @xcite .",
    "although only harmful mutations are considered , a population that increases exponentially in time is obtained . in order to avoid this exponential increase ,",
    "each individual has also a probability to die due to a lack of food or space .",
    "this probability is given by the verhulst factor @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of individuals at time @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the maximum carrying capacity of the environment , which is defined at the beginning of the simulation . at every time step , for each individual ,",
    "a random number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared to @xmath14 : if this number is smaller than @xmath14 the individual dies , independently of its age and genome .",
    "two different strategies of the antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism are now introduced into the penna model . in both cases",
    "we chose a priori two different positions among the 32 possible ones , to be considered as special positions .",
    "let us call them @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "* if , and only if , * an individual has two bits 1 ( homozygous ) at @xmath15 , or if only one bit is equal to 1 but @xmath15 happens to be a dominant position , and the individual succeeds in surviving until the age @xmath16 , then :    * case 1 : there is a probability @xmath17 that the current number of accumulated mutations is decreased by one . when the individual reaches @xmath16 , a random number between 0 and 1 is generated . if it is greater or equal to @xmath17 , the number of accumulated diseases is decreased .",
    "if it fails , in the next time step another random number is generated , and the process is repeated until it works .",
    "so in this case the number of accumulated mutations is decreased by one * only once * , at an age that can be equal or greater than @xmath16 .",
    "* case 2 : every year , from @xmath18 until death , there is a probability @xmath17 that the current number of accumulated mutations is decreased by one .",
    "so in this second case there is a * cumulative probability * of decreasing the current number of accumulated mutations .",
    "it is important to notice that in both cases the genomes of the individuals are not changed : only the counter of the number of mutations is decreased by one .",
    "we measure the survival rates and the mortalities of the populations as a function of age . for an already stable population",
    "the survival rate is defined as the ratio between the number of individuals with age @xmath19 and the number of individuals with age @xmath20 : @xmath21 the mortality is defined as @xcite : @xmath22 \\ , \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the number of deaths , due to genetic diseases , at age @xmath20 .",
    "the figures below were obtained using the following parameters :    * initial population = @xmath24 individuals ( half males and half females ) and maximum population size = @xmath25 individuals ; * minimum reproduction age @xmath26 ; * limit number of accumulated diseases @xmath27 ; * mutation rates @xmath28 ; * pleiotropic positions @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; * results averaged from 100 independent runs of @xmath24 steps each . for each run measurements",
    "are averaged from the last 5000 steps .    in figure 1",
    "we show the mortalities versus age in a linear - log scale , for the traditional penna model ( circles ) and for our case 1 .",
    "squares correspond to @xmath31 and diamonds to @xmath32 .",
    "as can be seen this strategy gives the same results as the traditional model , with the curves presenting an `` s '' shape , as already obtained before @xcite .",
    "( in fact , a much better agreement with the gompertz law is obtained for asexual populations @xcite , where the traditional penna model gives a straight line for the linear - log plot of the mortality as a function of age , for ages above the minimum reproduction age @xmath6 ) .    in figure 2",
    "we show the results for our case 2 , where a strong difference between the standard result ( circles ) and the cases where the cumulative probability @xmath17 is adopted can be noticed .",
    "now the mortalities decelerate at older ages , as observed for drosophilas @xcite , and may even present a peak ( triangles ) , as observed for medflies @xcite .",
    "( for a review on experimental results see @xcite ) .",
    "the small sharp peaks at age 9 ( squares and diamonds ) , which corresponds to our @xmath15 , shows that the population prefers to have the 9-th bit set to 1 , in order to profit from a decrease of the probability to die at older ages .    in figure 3",
    ", we show the survival rates for the same cases presented in figure 2 .",
    "again it can be seen a decrease of the survival probabilities at age 9 , for @xmath17 equal to 0.4 and 0.5 , showing that after many generations there is a fixation of the 9-th bit inside the population .",
    "we introduce an anusual form of antagonistic pleiotropy into the bit - string penna model for biological ageing .",
    "we show that it is possible to simulate the drosophila mortality , which decelerates at old ages , as well as the medfly mortality , which presents a peak around a given age ( fig .",
    "2 ) , even considering only homogeneous stable populations . depending on how the pleiotropy is introduced ,",
    "the exponential increase of human mortality with age is also obtained ( fig .",
