    "evaluated at @xmath12 , they provide composition factor multiplicities of verma modules ; this is one of the original kazhdan - lusztig conjectures from @xcite which was independently proven by beilinson and bernstein @xcite and by brylinski and kashiwara @xcite .",

    "then , @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .    for @xmath9 of general type",
    ", this result is due to brenti , caselli and marietti @xcite and independently to delanoy @xcite .",
    "the methods build on earlier work by brenti @xcite and du cloux @xcite , where the result was established in certain types .",
    "the more general family of kazhdan - lusztig - vogan ( klv ) polynomials was introduced in @xcite .",

    "the following combinatorially appealing situation then arises : we may think of the indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 simply as fixed point free involutions in the symmetric group @xmath2 of permutations of @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 is nonzero if and only if @xmath32 in the bruhat order on @xmath2 .",
    "denote by @xmath33 its subposet induced by the fixed point free involutions .",
    "the maximum of @xmath33 is the reverse permutation @xmath34 , the longest element in @xmath2 .",
    "our main result is the following combinatorial invariance assertion for klv polynomials :    [ th : mainv1 ] if @xmath35 \\to [ u',w_0]$ ] is a poset isomorphism of upper intervals in @xmath33 , then @xmath36 for all fixed point free involutions @xmath4 .",
    "the fixed point free involutions @xmath37 which satisfy @xmath38 for all @xmath39 form a subposet of @xmath33 which is isomorphic to the dual of the bruhat order on @xmath40 .",
    "when restricted to such @xmath24 , theorem [ th : mainv1 ] specialises to the type @xmath41 version of theorem [ th : winvariance ] , which is the main result of brenti s aforementioned work @xcite .    in order to briefly outline the proof idea ,",
    "let us first describe brenti s approach from @xcite .",
    "first , brenti observed that combinatorial invariance of kl polynomials is equivalent to that of the associated kl @xmath42-polynomials .",
    "at the heart of the recurrence relation for the @xmath42-polynomials is the map @xmath43 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "brenti s key idea was to replace such maps by _ special matchings _ , which are defined solely in terms of poset properties . by studying the possible special matchings of lower bruhat intervals , brenti was able to deduce the key fact , namely that the resulting poset theoretic recurrence actually is well - defined and computes the @xmath42-polynomials .",
    "our overall approach is very similar to that of brenti . instead of kl @xmath42-polynomials , we study what we call @xmath46-polynomials , which are a slight variation of vogan s klv @xmath42-polynomials . in our setting ,",
    "vogan s recurrence for the latter boils down to a recurrence for @xmath46-polynomials which relies on the conjugation map @xmath47 of fixed point free involutions @xmath48 . in order to obtain a poset theoretic recurrence ,",
    "we replace such conjugation maps by _ special partial matchings _ which are similar to special matchings , except that they may have fixed elements .",
    "again , the crux is to show that this indeed yields a recurrence which computes @xmath46-polynomials . rather than fixed point",
    "free involutions , we mostly work with the set of twisted identities @xmath49 ; multiplication by @xmath34 provides a bijection between the two which reverses the bruhat order .",
    "this viewpoint gives us convenient access to combinatorial tools already developed for twisted identities .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    ", we agree on notation and recall important definitions and tools .",
    "section [ se : iota ] contains some observations about twisted identities .",
    "special partial matchings are introduced in section [ se : spm ] , where technical assertions about the structure of such partial matchings are collected . in the final section we use them in order to prove our main result .",
