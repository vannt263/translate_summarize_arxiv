    "the next necessary condition is related to the support of the measure .  to date , there is no general algorithm to find the support of a representing measure for the _ nonsingular _ truncated moment problems , while there are concrete results in the singular case .  naturally , the atoms of a representing measure lie in the support of the measure ; moreover , as it easily follows from proposition [ prop-3 - 1 ] below , the support is contained in the _ algebraic variety _ of @xmath24 , which is the intersection of the zero sets of the polynomials arising from column dependence relations in @xmath4 ; that is , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",

    "* lemma 2.3 ) shows that consistency is fairly strong .",
    "consistency alone helps establish the existence of an interpolating linear functional , as a linear combination of point masses ( with some densities possibly negative ) .",

    "all necessary conditions introduced so far are not sufficient for general truncated moment problems .  in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.2 ) the algebraic variety is infinite ; this type of example illustrates that a moment problem with infinite algebraic variety is , generally speaking , more difficult to solve , an aspect one should keep in mind .     in @xcite , r. curto , l. fialkow and m. mller initiated the study of extremal moment problems ; that is , the case when @xmath63 and @xmath64 satisfy @xmath65 .",
    "the main result in @xcite follows ,    [ thm13 ] for @xmath66 extremal , i.e. , @xmath65 , the following are equivalent :    a.   @xmath5 has a representing measure ; b.   @xmath5 has a unique representing measure , which is @xmath67-atomic ; c.   @xmath68 is positive semidefinite and @xmath5 is consistent .",
    "for the special case of the column relation @xmath69 , a detailed study can be found in @xcite ; moreover , a complete solution appears in @xcite.to briefly summarize the main results of this case , observe first that such a bivariate sextic truncated moment problem allows only two extremal cases : @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see table 1 in section [ esmp ] ) .  for the former case , it was proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) that positivity and recursiveness are sufficient for the existence of representing measures .  on the other hand , when @xmath71 , consistency is required .",
    "since all the aforementioned conditions do not solve higher order truncated moment problems , a new notion must be discovered ; the first one came in @xcite , in which a solution of @xmath21 , for any @xmath72 , satisfying @xmath62 was presented with a numerical condition @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is a quantity dependent on the moments ) , together with positivity and the variety condition .",
    "this type of numerical condition was never needed in solving quadratic and quartic moment problems , but it was somewhat naturally expected as part of the solution of higher order moment problems .",
    "our main results in subsequent sections will confirm that numerical conditions play an important role in solving truncated moment problems .",
    "our solutions require new cubics or quartics whose zero sets contain the original algebraic variety , together with cubics arising from the column dependence of the moment matrix .  for these new polynomials , we need to verify consistency ; it is this verification that will bring a new type of numerical condition .",
    "we briefly pause to remind the reader that there exists an equivalence between bivariate real moments problems and one - variate complex moment problems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1.12 ) .",
    "thus , in what follows we freely switch between real moment matrices @xmath4 with columns @xmath75 and complex moment matrices @xmath76 with columns @xmath77 .    in this note ,",
    "our focus is on the bivariate moment problem , with associated @xmath78 with submatrix @xmath79 positive and invertible , and with a finite algebraic variety .",
    "we examine extremal truncated real moment problems with cubic column relations .  in @xcite , we discussed a general case of complex sextic moment problems with a cubic harmonic column relation , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .  in that paper , we showed that the polynomial has zeros symmetrically located , for certain values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , this problem turns out to _ be extremal _ and a solution was discovered by checking consistency of the moment matrix after establishing a representation theorem of polynomials vanishing on the algebraic variety @xmath84 , namely @xmath85 . in sections [ sec - r-7 ] and [ sec - r-8 ] , sextic moment problems with more general cubic column relations in real form will be considered ; we will focus on the extremal cases .     for the case of harmonic polynomials of the form @xmath86 , a representation theorem of polynomials vanishing on the algebraic variety ( which consists of @xmath87 points )",
    "is achieved by dimensional analysis between a quotient space of complex polynomials and a higher dimensional complex space @xcite ; for more general cases , the division algorithm from algebraic geometry will be used instead .",
    "conceptually , the set @xmath85 behaves like an ideal and is generated by polynomials from the column relations , plus a few other polynomials obtained from solving vandermonde equations . in this paper",
    "we focus on the use of the division algorithm as a means of identifying a small collection of polynomials for which the consistency property must be verified .",
    "this explicit listing of just a few polynomials is useful in concrete situations , since it reduces the calculations needed to prove the existence of a representing measure .",
    "on the other hand , we should also keep in mind the general strategy in @xcite , esp .",
    "proposition 3.6 and remark 3.7 , in which l. fialkow presents a general test for consistency in the case of a finite algebraic variety , and when the points of the variety are known .",
    "thus , we wish to make the reader aware that our approach is not necessarily unique , from the point of view of determining solubility from the concrete knowledge of the algebraic variety .",
    "we emphasize the division algorithm , but a different approach could be developed using large vandermonde matrices and a single matrix - vector equation @xmath88 , following the conceptual ideas in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we settle all remaining cases of the extremal sextic moment problem , via an application of the division algorithm in real algebraic geometry .",
    "the algorithm , which follows , involves polynomials in several indeterminates .",
    "[ divalg ] ( division algorithm @xcite ) fix a monomial order @xmath89 on @xmath90 , and let @xmath91 be an ordered @xmath92-tuple of polynomials in @xmath93 $ ] .",

    "we call @xmath13 a _ remainder _ of @xmath100 on division by @xmath101.furthermore , if @xmath102 then we have @xmath103    we shall use the division algorithm to prove a structure theorem for polynomials vanishing on the algebraic variety of @xmath61 .",
    "although not necessary to solve the truncated moment problem , we note that one significant difference between the one - dimensional and multi - dimensional versions of the division algorithm lies in the fact that a remainder might not be unique in the latter case .",
    "thus , the division algorithm might be regarded as an imperfect generalization of the traditional ( one - variable ) version .",
    "however , this situation can be fixed through the so - called _ grebner basis_.  for further study on this topic ,",
    "the reader is referred to ( * ? ? ? * section 2.3 ) .",
