    "these three classes of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs exhibit distinctly different spectral features due to the decrease in photospheric temperature from m through l to t. in addition , m dwarfs often show h@xmath1 in emission . down to the early m dwarfs ,",
    "h@xmath1  activity correlates with rotation and thus decreases with age as stars lose angular momentum over time via stellar winds . beyond objects of spectral type m8",
    ", however , it appears that h@xmath1  activity is stronger in more massive objects , even if they are older ( gizis et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "the frequency of h@xmath1  emission peaks around type m7 and declines for later - type l and t dwarfs , reaching zero at l5 ( gizis et  al .",
    "however , contrary to this trend , ( 2000 ) reported the discovery of a t dwarf with strong h@xmath1 emission . here",

    "2massij1315309@xmath0264951 ( hereafter 2mass1315@xmath02649 ) was targeted for spectroscopy as part of a color - selected survey of agn candidates from the two - micron all - sky survey second incremental data relase ( 2massi ) .",
    "that survey will appear elsewhere ( hall 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "potential agn candidates were selected from the 2massi point source catalog by requiring @xmath3 or @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and that they not be affected by blending , saturation or confusion with other objects , known artifacts or minor planets .",
    "actual agn candidates were then selected from the list of potential candidates using color criteria based on those of & hall ( 2001 ) .",
    "2mass1315@xmath02649 was included in a subsample of objects with @xmath7@xmath81.5 and @xmath9@xmath1013.5 .",
    "spectra of 2mass1315@xmath02649 were secured during two runs with cspec at the ctio 1.5 m telescope .",
    "both runs used a 300 lines / mm grating blazed at 6750 , for a resolution of 8.6  given the 15 slit .",
    "wavelength coverage was 5780@xmath09270  at 2.89 / pixel .",
    "two 12-minute exposures were begun at ut 06:09 on 2001 march 30 .",
    "a 12-minute and a 24-minute exposure were obtained through cirrus beginning at ut 23:39 on 2001 august 15 .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were debiased and flatfielded in the usual manner using iraf .",
    "each pair of reduced two - dimensional spectra was then coadded with exposure time weighting and 5@xmath11 cosmic ray rejection .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra show a close pair of objects .",
    "2mass1315@xmath02649 at @xmath1=13:15:30.94 , @xmath12=@xmath026:49:51.3 ( j2000 ) is an optically faint l dwarf with h@xmath1 emission , and usnoj131531.23@xmath0264953.0 an optically brighter star slightly south of east .",
    "both objects were visible on the guide camera , and the east - west slit was positioned as best as possible to obtain spectroscopy of both .",
    "however , unlike usnoj131531.23@xmath0264953.0 , 2mass1315@xmath02649 is faint enough that it may have drifted off the slit without being immediately noticed .",
    "the east - west separation between the objects in the two - dimensional spectra is 55@xmath1303 , as determined from the centroids of the spatial profiles of the two objects in the spectra from the two independent epochs .",
    "this is significantly larger than the 39 east - west separation expected for the 2mass - usno separation of 423 at pa 114.5  e of n. this suggests that one or both of the objects exhibited proper motion between the 2mass epoch of 1998.411 and the spectroscopic observations .",
    "however , better data are needed to verify this since cspec delivers a 2 - 3 pixel fwhm spectrum at a spatial scale of 13/pixel .",
    "the spectra were optimally extracted using iraf , with the usno star s trace used for both objects .",
    "flux calibration was provided by gd108 ( oke 1990 ) in march and ltt1788 ( hamuy et  al .",
    "1994 ) in august .",
    "the spectral type of usnoj131531.23@xmath0264953.0 must be no later than k5 , since its spectrum lacks strong features .",
    "the spectra of 2mass1315@xmath02649 are discussed next .",
    "figure [ figure ] shows the march and august spectra of 2mass1315@xmath02649 . by comparison to the spectral atlas of ( 2000 ) , i estimate a spectral class between l2 and l4 on the ( 1999 ) system , and adopt l3 . due to the poor quality of the spectra",
    ", this classification is not based on single features , but on the agreement between numerous features .",
    "the absence of strong tio and vo features at 7000 - 8400  puts the class no earlier than l2 .",
    "the flatness of the spectrum from 8400 - 9000  and the continuum level there compared to 7500  are inconsistent with spectral types l5 and higher .",
    "h@xmath1  is visible in both the two - dimensional and one - dimensional spectra from both observing runs , but it is clear that at least its equivalent width ( ew ) varied between the two runs . the total h@xmath1 flux may not have been measured accurately in either run because the east - west slit was comparable in size to the seeing and was not centered precisely on 2mass1315@xmath02649 .",
    "also , the august spectrum was obtained through cirrus and so its absolute fluxing is untrustworthy . on the other hand , ew",
    "measurements from both runs will be accurate unless the h@xmath1 emission is extended , for which there is no evidence in the two - dimensional spectra , or the contamination of the l dwarf spectrum by the usno star spectrum was different . to estimate the contamination of the l dwarf spectrum by the usno star spectrum ,",
    "in each two - dimensional spectrum the l dwarf aperture was reflected in the spatial direction around the centroid of the usno star aperture and the flux in the mirrored aperture was extracted .",
    "this contaminating flux is negligible at @xmath148000  in both epochs , but is larger at @xmath158000  in the august spectrum , yielding the stronger continuum seen there in figure [ figure]b .",
    "this makes the august ew measurement an underestimate , but does not affect the spectral typing of the object .",
    "the h@xmath1 ew was 121@xmath1331  in march but only 25@xmath1310  in august .",
    "the h@xmath1 flux was measured to be 3.23@xmath130.82 @xmath16 10@xmath17 ergs s@xmath18 @xmath19 in march . even including a correction factor of 1.42 for the nonphotometric conditions of the august measurement estimated by scaling the flux from 8000 - 9260  to match the march data , the august h@xmath1  flux is only 1.49@xmath130.58 @xmath16 10@xmath17 ergs s@xmath18 @xmath19 , about a factor of two below the march measurement .",
    "thus it does appear that the absolute flux as well as the equivalent width of the h@xmath1  emission varied .",
    "the ratio of the h@xmath1  luminosity ( or flux ) to the bolometric luminosity ( or flux ) is a useful quantity since it can constrain the emission mechanism .",
    "the bolometric flux of 2mass1315@xmath02649 was estimated using the bolometric correction from the @xmath9 band of bc@xmath20=3.33 found by ( 1993 ) for the l4 dwarf gd165b .",
    "this yields an apparent bolometric magnitude of @xmath21 . since @xmath22 ergs s@xmath18 @xmath19 for @xmath23 ( cox 2000 )",
    ", @xmath24 ergs s@xmath18 @xmath19 for 2mass1315@xmath02649 .",
    "thus @xmath25 in march , and @xmath26 in august ( after accounting for nonphotometric conditions ) .",
    "both values are lower limits due to the use of a narrow slit with uncertain placement relative to the object .",
    "how does the h@xmath1  emission in 2mass1315@xmath02649 compare to that in other late - type dwarf stars ? ( 2000 ) studied the h@xmath1  emission properties of a sample of nearby m and l dwarfs and found that @xmath2720@xmath1310% of l2-l4 dwarfs show h@xmath1  emission .",
    "however , the strongest h@xmath1  emission object in their sample has only @xmath28 .",
    "subsequently , ( 2000 ) reported h@xmath1  emission with @xmath29 in the t dwarf 2massij1237392 + 652615 . possible variability in this object s",
    "h@xmath1  flux was reported at the 2.8@xmath11 level in one spectrum , but more detailed analysis shows that the spectra are consistent with no variability ( burgasser et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "thus even the august spectrum of 2mass1315@xmath02649 has stronger h@xmath1  emission than reported in any other l dwarf , and the variable h@xmath1  emission in this object is the first reported for any l dwarf .",
    "the study of ( 2000 ) indicates that as an l dwarf with h@xmath1  emission , 2mass1315@xmath02649 is likely massive enough ( and old enough ) to have burned lithium , but the physical explanation for this correlation with mass is unknown .",
    "the various explanations considered by ( 2000 ) for h@xmath1  emission in the t dwarf 2mass1237 + 6526 can also be considered for 2mass1315@xmath02649 .",
    "acoustic heating is ruled out as a possible dominant energy source for strong h@xmath1  emission in l or t dwarfs (  3.3 of burgasser et  al .",
    "2000 ) , but several other possibilities remain viable .",
    "\\(2000 ) discuss the possibility of sustained roche lobe overflow in close brown dwarf binaries .",
    "such accretion might explain steady h@xmath1  emission without a strong accompanying thermal spectrum if the accretion produces h@xmath1  emission from ionization at a shock front or from magnetic field lines streaming onto the pole of the primary , rather than from an accretion disk .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that the t dwarf 2mass1237 + 6526 and the m9.5e dwarf pc0025 + 0447 could be examples of such systems .",
    "such an explanation can not be ruled out for 2mass1315@xmath02649 , but its confirmed variable h@xmath1  would require variability in some part of the accretion process .",
    "such variability has not been convincingly observed in the other two objects and might not be expected in the case of accretion from sustained roche lobe overflow .",
    "magnetic fields are believed to drive h@xmath1  emission from f to early m stars via an internal dynamo which is stronger for faster - rotating stars , such as the @xmath1-@xmath30 dynamo ( parker 1955 ) .",
    "such dynamos require a radiative / convective boundary to anchor flux lines and therefore break down as stars become fully convective ( @xmath270.3@xmath31 , spectral type m4 ) .",
    "however , the observed h@xmath1  activity level in m dwarfs shows no sign of this transition , remaining constant at @xmath32 ( hawley , gizis , & reid 1996 ) .",
    "this suggests that some other mechanism , probably a turbulent dynamo ( durney , de young , & roxburgh 1993 ) , contributes substantially to the magnetic field in very late type dwarfs .",
    "the value of @xmath33 in 2mass1315@xmath02649 is an order of magnitude larger than in most l dwarfs , but is still lower than the average value of @xmath03.8 measured for m dwarfs ( see figure 7 of 2000 ) .",
    "thus it is at least plausible that the same mechanism at work in late m dwarfs ( whether a turbulent dynamo or something else ) could provide the magnetic field required to explain the h@xmath1  flux in 2mass1315@xmath02649 and possibly the t dwarf 2mass1237 + 6526 .",
    "this would mean that they just have stronger than average magnetic fields for l and t dwarfs .",
    "if this is the case , then the variable h@xmath1  emission in 2mass1315@xmath02649 requires at least a slow variation in its magnetic field .",
    "however , no late type dwarf is known to show long - term variability of more than a factor of two at x - ray or extreme ultraviolet wavelengths (  4 of 1996 ) , and variability in h@xmath1  is not likely to be greater than variability at those wavelengths . on the other hand",
    ", flares are known to occur in m dwarfs and have been detected at radio wavelengths in the l3.5 dwarf 2masswj0036159 + 182110 ( berger 2002 ) .",
    "thus while the spectra presented here do not rule out a slow variation in its magnetic field as the cause of the h@xmath1  variability in this l dwarf , a more rapid variation  a flare  seems much more likely , as discussed next .",
    "flares ( seen in h@xmath1 , the radio , the uv , and x - rays ) on late type stars are powered by the energy released during a sudden reconfiguration of the magnetic field structure .",
    "detection of a flare therefore confirms the existence of a stellar magnetic field . however , strong flares in m dwarfs typically last only a few hours ( hawley & pettersen 1991 ) and occur unpredictably , making them difficult to observe .",
    "it may very well be that 2mass1315@xmath02649 was flaring when the discovery spectra were obtained .",
    "the h@xmath1  emission did not vary more than 1@xmath11 ( 25% ) on a timescale of @xmath2715 minutes between successive two - dimensional spectra in march , but this is consistent with the rate of change of the h@xmath1  flux in the m9.5 dwarf 2mass0149 + 2956 during the flare observed by ( 1999 ) .",
    "given that h@xmath1  flaring is known to occur in m dwarfs and radio flaring in at least one l dwarf ( berger 2002 ) , flaring seems the most likely explanation for the h@xmath1  variability in 2mass1315@xmath02649 .",
    "however , the other possibilities discussed earlier can not yet be ruled out .",
    "the current data does not prove that the variation in h@xmath1  occurred on a timescale short enough to be called a flare , and radio , h@xmath1  and x - ray and activity may be decoupled for spectral types later than m8 ( berger 2002 ) , further monitoring of 2mass1315@xmath02649 is needed to firmly determine the energy source for its h@xmath1  emission . if its variable h@xmath1  emission is due to flaring , 2mass1315@xmath02649 is probably similar to the m9.5 dwarf bri0021@xmath00214 ( reid et  al .",
    "both objects show only h@xmath1  in emission and have peak @xmath33 values lower than the average for m dwarfs .",
    "however , the spectra do not rule out the possibility that 2mass1315@xmath02649 is a flare star with emission from lines other than h@xmath1 , similar to 2mass0149 + 2956 ( liebert et  al .",
    "there is no evidence for such lines in march to limits of 0.5@xmath34 , but in 2mass0149 + 2956 the strongest other lines had 0.1@xmath34 . there is also no evidence in the march spectra for the stronger continuum and veiling of molecular bands seen during the flare in 2mass0149 + 2956",
    ". only changes of a factor of two or more in the continuum level can be ruled out , but this is sufficient to place 2mass1315@xmath02649 at either an earlier or later stage in any such flare , as follows .",
    "the h@xmath1  ew in 2mass0149 + 2956 increased ( from 200  to 330 ) during the observed portion of the flare because the continuum flux at h@xmath1  decreased more quickly ( from ten to three times the quiescent flux ) than the h@xmath1  line flux did . in 2mass1315@xmath02649",
    "the h@xmath1  ew was 121  in march , but the continuum flux at h@xmath1  was at most twice the quiescent flux ( estimated from the august spectrum ) .",
    "this h@xmath1  ew and continuum level can not be simultaneously reproduced by simply scaling any of the 2mass0149 + 2956 observations , even accounting for the weaker continuum at h@xmath1  in an l3 dwarf .",
    "thus , if they were the same type of flare , and if the relationship between the continuum and h@xmath1  line flux in this type of flare is independent of its luminosity , then 2mass1315@xmath02649 must have been observed at a later ( or perhaps earlier ) stage of its flare . any model for such flares",
    "must then incorporate the observed limit of @xmath2725% variation in h@xmath1  on @xmath2715 minute timescales at such a stage in the flare .",
    "if the h@xmath1  emisssion in 2mass1315@xmath02649 in march was from a flare , regardless of what type , then the large range in @xmath33 for flaring m dwarfs extends to l dwarfs as well . as pointed out by ( 1999 ) , this suggests a wide variation in intrinsic magnetic field strength , efficiency of energy transport to the stellar chromosphere during a flare , or both .",
    "2massij1315309@xmath0264951 is an l3 dwarf with strong h@xmath1 emission which decreased in strength by about a factor of two between two epochs separated by 137 days , the first reported variable h@xmath1  emission in an l dwarf .",
    "the h@xmath1  emission in 2massi j1315309@xmath0264951 must be powered either by magnetic activity or by accretion in a binary system .",
    "accreting binaries are rare , so that hypothesis is unlikely .",
    "the spectra presented here do not rule out a slow variation in h@xmath1  strength , but slow variations of the observed amplitude are rare among m dwarfs .",
    "since flaring powered by reconnection of magnetic fields is common in m dwarfs and a radio flare has been detected in the l3.5 dwarf 2masswj0036159 + 182110 ( berger 2002 ) , a flare is the logical explanation for the h@xmath1  variability in 2massij1315309@xmath0264951 ,    the value of @xmath2 observed at the discovery epoch is larger than that of any other l dwarf but comparable to the value of @xmath35 observed for 2massi j1237392 + 652615 , the only reported t dwarf with h@xmath1  emission .",
    "however , both these values lie well below the average @xmath36 observed in m dwarfs .",
    "only two l dwarfs and one t dwarf are known to exhibit h@xmath1  emission of strength @xmath37 .",
    "thus perhaps two percent of l or t dwarfs exhibit h@xmath1  emission this strong at any given time .",
    "given the small number statistics , this is consistent with the duty cycles observed for h@xmath1  flares ( @xmath277% ; 2000 ) and radio flares ( 2 - 10% ; 2002 ) among late - type dwarfs . spectroscopic or narrow - band h@xmath1  monitoring of l and t dwarfs on timescales of hours to days is needed to determine if the frequency of strong h@xmath1  emission is governed by flaring , by the upper envelope of the magnetic field strength distribution , or by accretion in binary systems .",
