    "the physics of fermion - fermion scattering plays a crucial role in a wide variety of scattering experiments , which probe the behavior of elementary particles .",
    "nevertheless , these theoretical investigations often focus on classical observables such as cross section and decay rate , since these quantities are simpler to access via experiment .",
    "an essential property that distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics is the possibility of entanglement between different degrees of freedom .",
    "it is a characteristic feature of some states of a composite system that can not be decomposed into a direct product form of subsystems .",
    "these states also called entanglement states .",
    "entanglement entropy is a measure of how much a given quantum state is quantum mechanically entangled . in the paper , we investigate issues of entanglement entropy in simple example of fermion - fermion scattering .    even though quantum information was originally formulated in terms of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , recent years have seen increasing research interest in studying it within the more fundamental framework of quantum field theory .",
    "calabrese and cardy have systematically studied issues of entanglement entropy in the quantum field with the use of a replica trick @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework to study entanglement entropy in cosmology is the quantum field theory in curved background @xcite .",
    "an expanding spacetime generates entanglement between certain modes of an exclusively gravitationally interacting scalar field , whose entanglement entropy contains information about the parameters of the cosmic history @xcite .",
    "when one considers a composite system with subsystem a and its complement @xmath1 separated by a surface , the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of the surface , and depends on the uv cutoff , which regulates the short - distance correlations .",
    "applied to black hole , solodukhin @xcite calculates the entanglement entropy when the entangling surface is the black - hole horizon . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the entanglement entropy can be interpreted not as the total but as a partial ( quantum corrections ) contribution to the black hole entropy .",
    "a more complete understanding may arise from the ads / cft .",
    "ryu and takayanagi @xcite achieved the holographic derivation of entanglement entropy in quantum ( conformal ) field theories from the perspective of ads / cft . in these articles ,",
    "the entanglement entropy between a and @xmath1 was obtained by evaluating @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the area of a minimal surface whose boundary is the boundary of the subsystem a. these provide a geometric understanding of entanglement .",
    "furthermore , the er = epr conjecture by maldacena and susskind @xcite provides us with another geometric interpretation for entanglement entropy . the two distant black holes connected through a einstein - rosen bridge ( or a wormhole ) in the interior can be interpreted as corresponding to a maximally entangled state of two black holes that form a complex einstein - rosen - podolski pair .",
    "they suggest that entangled states contain similar bridges in general .",
    "the entanglement between two particles , which are , for example , a pair of accelerating quark and antiquark , the epr pair created via the schwinger effect and a pair of scattering gluons in strongly coupled super yang - mills theory ( sym ) , had been studied [ 13,14,15,16 ] .",
    "these research attempts gave some supportive examples for the er = epr conjecture .",
    "in the ads / cft correspondence , the scattering amplitude in a strongly coupled field theory can be related to the area of the minimal surface of the wilson loop of trajectories of scattering particles @xcite . on the other hand , the holographic entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of a minimal surface in ads spacetimes . in a word ,",
    "both the scattering amplitude and entanglement entropy in a strongly coupled field theory are associated with minimal surfaces from the point of view of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "references.@xcite studied the entanglement entropy of two divided momentum spaces with the perturbative calculations method , and this method was then followed by refs.@xcite for the study of the entanglement between two scalar particles in the scattering process in a weakly coupled field theory .",
    "they found that the entanglement entropy changes during the scattering process , and this variation of entanglement entropy from initial state to final state is proportional to the cross section .",
    "being attracted by the interestingness of the previous research , several authors invested multiple attempts to study the behavior of the entanglement between particles in the scattering process from different perspectives @xcite . but all these efforts , focusing on elastic scattering of scalar particles and only considering the entanglement of momentum degrees of freedom , worked in toy models .",
    "all matter particles and antimatter particles in nature are the fundamental fermions ( quarks , leptons , antiquarks , and antileptons ) .",
    "in addition to the momentum degree of freedom , fermions carry half - integer spin and helicity degrees of freedom not possessed by scalar particles .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in quantum information processing , the spin of a particle is often used as a qubit regardless of the momentum state of the particle .",
    "however , spin and momenta are not separable in general in the relativistic motion .",
    "to better generalize the entanglement behaviors of scattering scalar particles to the general fields , we need to study it in a fundamental model .",
    "the goal of this paper is to carry out the perturbative calculations method in @xcite for fermion - fermion scattering , i.e. the simplest qed process @xmath0 .    in sec .",
    "2 , we give the variation of entanglement entropy of the two scattering fermions with respect to different entanglement of the initial state , and we consider the qed scattering process @xmath0 as an example of a case study . the spin state and the helicity state",
    "are the basis of hilbert space for the dirac field , however , spin entanglement and helicity entanglement are hinted of different properties by ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec . 3",
    ", we numerically analyze the mutual information between spin ( helicity ) and momentum degrees of freedom with one fermion in scattering process .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the conclusion and discussion .",
    "we consider the scattering process of two fermionic fields , @xmath4 , with the hamiltonian @xmath5 . for an elastic scattering process of two fermions , the hilbert space for both",
    "the initial state and final state would be ( 1 + 1)-particle fock space . at weak coupling",
    ", we can assume the unitarity of local interaction terms to be guaranteed at lower orders of perturbation @xcite .",
    "the initial and final states can be viewed as superposition of the basis of free hamiltonian @xmath6 so that we can divide the total hilbert space as @xmath7 .",
    "since incoming and outgoing particles are free on - shell particles , we can describe the ( 1 + 1)-particle states as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the 3-momenta of particles , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 denote the spin or helicity of the particle .",
    "the fermionic creation / annihilation operators obey the commutation relations , @xmath13 and the inner product between 2-particle states is defined as @xmath14 these creation / annihilation operators are the mode coefficient of fourier expansion of free fermion fields @xmath15 for a scattering process , the final state is determined by the initial state and the @xmath16 matrix@xcite , @xmath17 the @xmath18 matrix be defined as @xmath19 and the invariant matrix element @xmath20 , @xmath21    the authors of ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite analyzed the entanglement between scalar particles , where the entanglement occurs among momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "what is more interesting is the entanglement between the spin degrees of freedom for fermionic particles . in the following",
    ", we will give the entanglement entropy between fermionic degrees of freedom .",

    "the factors @xmath18 and @xmath37 will be eliminated with a proper normalization .    from eq.(@xmath41 ) we can evaluate the total density matrix of final state by @xmath42 .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath43 is obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom for particle @xmath44 , @xmath45 , producing the following result @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the normalization factor fixed by @xmath48 , @xmath49 and introducing a shorthand notation for the long expression @xmath50 in the weak coupling , the reduced density matrix at order @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 then the entanglement entropy between @xmath56 and @xmath44 in the final is @xmath57 , and this is what we are going to study in the context of fermion - fermion scattering process .      in the following",
    ", we will consider a simple reaction @xmath58 in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the particle interaction during the scattering process induces change in the degree of entanglement between the particles from the incoming state to the outgoing state .",
    "we are interested in studying this variation of entanglement and shall proceed as follows .",
    "the mass of particles is ignorable at high energy .",
    "working in the center of mass frame , as the fig .",
    "1 , the initial and final 4-momenta for @xmath58 are @xmath59 the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath60 in eq.(@xmath61 ) can readily be obtained , @xmath62 we then derive the entanglement entropy of the final state , @xmath63 where @xmath64 for a given initial state , the change of entanglement entropy from initial to final state @xmath65 in terms of the unpolarized total cross section for the scattering @xmath58 , @xmath66 , ( ref.@xcite ) the term @xmath67 in eq.(@xmath68 ) becomes @xmath69 thus , the variation of entanglement entropy would be @xmath70+\\frac{\\sigma_tt}{v}g_1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71(a_{k1}\\log a_{k1}+a_{k2}\\log a_{k2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the variation of entanglement entropy for the scattering process of two scalar particles in refs.@xcite correspond to the first term in our result eq.(@xmath72 ) .",
    "the extra term , the second term comes from the entanglement of spin - spin and spin - momentum , which reflects the unique effect in fermionic system .",
    "the variation of entanglement entropy between particle @xmath56 and @xmath44 in the scattering process @xmath58 is plotted in fig .",
    "2 .            from eq.(@xmath72 ) we find that the variation of entanglement entropy is proportional to the quantity , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the unpolarizd total cross section for the above scattering process at the first order of perturbation theory .",
    "spatial volume @xmath37 and duration @xmath18 denote the spacetime volume encompassing the entire scattering process ; they originate from the inner product of the single - mode state whose norm possesses a delta - functional divergence .",
    "in other words , ignoring the unphysical infinite factors @xmath37 and @xmath18 , the variation of entanglement entropy in a scattering process is proportional to @xmath74 , the cross section .",
    "in fact , the cross section is the effective area of a chunk taken out of one beam , by each particle in the other beam @xcite .",
    "so , the variation of entanglement entropy in a scattering process is shown to be proportional to the area quantity . we know",
    "that , for a ground state of a quantum many - body system , the entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows with the boundary area of the subregion , and not with its volume @xcite .",
    "such `` area laws '' for the entanglement entropy emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields , in the context of black hole physics , quantum information science , and quantum many - body physics .",
    "our results also seem to reflect the basic characteristics of entanglement entropy , area laws .",
    "in the above calculation , the initial state and final state can be regarded as generated by the basis of an asymptotically free hamiltonian , and then their total hilbert space can be divided into @xmath7 . for a subsystem ,",
    "say a , choosing spin state as the complete basis , its hilbert space @xmath75 can be further divided into @xmath76 , the spin and momentum degrees of freedom of subsystem @xmath56 .",
    "then the total hilbert space for the initial state and final state can be decomposed into @xmath77 . the mutual information between spin and momentum degrees of freedom for subsystem @xmath56 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath80 .",
    "mutual information is always greater than or equal to zero , with equality if and only if the density matrix for the subsystem @xmath56 is the tensor product of the reduced density matrices for subsysterms @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the initial state .    in the following ,",
    "we calculate the mutual information between the spin and momentum for particle a in the scattering process @xmath58 .",
    "we use the same initial spin state parametrization as ( @xmath83 @xmath84 this gives zero value initial mutual information between spin and momentum degrees of freedom for particle @xmath56 , @xmath85 . as was explained in previous section , the final state and reduced density matrix",
    "are determined by the initial state and @xmath16 matrix . in the analogous calculation",
    ", the mutual information between the spin and momentum of particle @xmath56 can be obtained .",
    "the momentum reduced density matrix for particle @xmath56 reads @xmath86 where @xmath87 the corresponding von neumann entropy is @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "similarly , we have the spin reduced density matrix for particle @xmath56 , @xmath90 with @xmath91 and the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath92 are found , @xmath93 the corresponding von neumann entropy @xmath94 where @xmath95 .    for the given initial state",
    ", we thus obtain the variation of mutual information between spin and momentum degrees of freedom for particle @xmath56 @xmath96 where @xmath97 , with functions @xmath98 given in previous sections .",
    "the variation of mutual information between spin and momentum for particle @xmath56 in the scattering process @xmath58 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 .",
    "as explained above , the mutual information vanishes for the initial state with arbitrarily valued entanglement parameters @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , that is , @xmath85 . from eq.(@xmath103 ) and fig .",
    "3 , for and exclusively for a maximally entangled initial state between particles @xmath56 and @xmath44 ( @xmath32 ) , the mutual information for the final state is nearly zero .",
    "the zero value of mutual information means there is no entanglement between the spin and momentum degrees of freedom within particle @xmath56 .",
    "generally , interactions cause change in the degree of entanglement between subsystems , but it is interesting to see that the degree of entanglement between the spin and momentum within particle @xmath56 in the scattering process does not change when the initial state is maximally entangled .",
    "then we conclude that the increasing degree of entanglement between two particles in the initial state restricts the generation of entanglement between the spin and momentum degrees of freedom within one particle in the final state .      for one fermion ,",
    "both helicity states and spin states can be employed as the complete basis of hilbert space .",
