    "magnetic colloids ( so - called _ ferrofluids _ [ 1,2 ] ) represent very interesting object for studies of convection . even in the absence of the gravity , mechanical equilibrium of a nonisothermal ferrofluid in a magnetic field @xmath1",
    "is in general impossible . at the basis of the mechanism of _ thermomagnetic _ convection [ 1 - 5 ]",
    "lies the temperature dependence of the magnetization @xmath2 : under otherwise equal conditions , the colder elements of the fluid are more strongly magnetized , and therefore they are subject to a larger magnetic force in the direction of @xmath3 .",
    "the gradients of the magnetic field intensity here play the same role as does the gravitational field @xmath4 in the mechanism of ordinary thermogravitational convection , whilst the temperature dependence of the magnetization , @xmath5 , plays the role of @xmath6-dependence of the fluid density @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , thermomagnetic convection can arise even in a _ uniform _ applied magnetic field [ 4 ] .",
    "let a ferrofluid confined between two horizontal planes be in a uniform vertical external field @xmath8 at the temperature @xmath9 .",
    "then the dependence @xmath5 leads to the result that the field _ inside _ the fluid , @xmath10 , appears to be _",
    "nonuniform_. indeed , from the maxwell equation @xmath11 and the definition of magnetic induction @xmath12 it follows @xmath13 that yields @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the differential magnetic permeability .",
    "equation ( 1.1 ) shows that the induced gradient of magnetic field is directed always _ opposite _ to the gradient of magnetization .",
    "it results in unstable magnetization stratification : the magnetic force @xmath16 tries to mix ferrofluid .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( 1.2 ) , this force is proportional to the imposed temperature gradient .",
    "therefore , when both the magnetic and buoyancy mechanisms are operative , the first of two predominates over the second one at the onset of convection in a _",
    "thin enough _ fluid layers , where the critical temperature gradient is sufficiently large . one can show [ 1 ] that the condition @xmath17 which permits neglect the buoyancy mechanism of convection , is reduced to @xmath18 ^ 2 , \\eqno(1.3)\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the layer thickness , @xmath20 the critical rayleigh number ( @xmath21 in the case of rigid boundaries and @xmath22 for free boundaries ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the fluid viscosity and thermodiffusivity . for commonly used magnetite ferrofluids on the base of water or kerosene",
    "the pyromagnetic coefficient @xmath25 in the field @xmath26 is about @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the volume fraction of magnetic grains .",
    "then for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , the inequality ( 1.3 ) holds true down to @xmath31 .",
    "the same conclusion has been done by finlayson [ 4 ] who first studied theoretically convective instability of a ferrofluid layer heated from below in the presence of a uniform vertical magnetic field .",
    "it is important to notice that in [ 4 ] and posterior theoretical works [ 5 - 8 ] ferrofluids were treated as pure ( i.e. , single - component ) magnetized fluids .",
    "such a model assumes a fixed uniform concentration of magnetic grains , @xmath32 . ignoring in that way _ diffusion effects _ , authors of [ 4 - 8 ] came to conclusion that only _",
    "stationary _ convective instability is possible in ferrofluids . as it pointed out already in the abstract of ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , `` oscillatory instability can not occur '' .",
    "but a real ferrofluid should be treated as a _ binary mixture _ with allowance for concentration dependence of its magnetization .",
    "an externally imposed temperature gradient induces in a ferrofluid layer a concentration gradient owing to the _",
    "soret effect_. both these gradients cause a spatial variation in magnetization @xmath33 that leads in turn to appearance of a magnetic field gradient within the fluid layer . thus there",
    "arise magnetic forces , which try to mix the ferrofluid and , in addition , they induce a certain redistribution of magnetic grains due to . as it will be shown below , just the magnetophoresis together with the thermophoresis ( the soret effect ) give rise to _ oscillatory instability _ in a certain region of the magnetic field intensity and the fluid parameters .",
    "appropriate experimental conditions to observe predicted instability take place in a thin ferrofluid layer , when the ordinary ( buoyancy ) mechanism of convection is negligible and the characteristic diffusion time , @xmath34 , required to settle a steady state , is not too long ( here @xmath35 is the diffusion coefficient of magnetic particles in the basic liquid ) .",
    "recent measurements [ 9 ] yielded @xmath36 in water and cyclohexane .",
    "( this magnitude of @xmath35 agrees well with a theoretical estimate by the einstein s formula for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the diameter of a magnetic grain ) . according to above formula for @xmath39",
    ", the concentration equilibrium in a ferrofluid layer of the thickness @xmath31 is reached after one hour .    in the next section",
    "we obtain the description of the magnetophoresis and soret effect in a ferrofluid assuming that the fluid behaves with respect to an external magnetic field like a langevin s paramagnet [ 1,10 ] . in secs . 3 and 4 we derive the complete set of modified linear equations for perturbations and settle the boundary conditions for them .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is solved in sec . 5 for the bnard configuration .",
    "on the base of the solution , oscillatory instability is predicted to occur for a wide range of magnitudes of magnetic field , soret coefficient , and other fluid parameters .",
    "owing to the small magnitude of @xmath35 ( see above ) , there are possible two scenarios of the beginnings of convection .",
    "depending on the imposed heating rate , the ferrofluid may behave either as a binary mixture or like a pure fluid .",
    "both the possibilities are discussed in sec .",

    "firstly , the codimension-2 point ( i.e. , the intersection point of @xmath48 and @xmath294 branches ) is usually located in the close vicinity of @xmath178 . in fig .",
    "5 this point has essentially shifted towards positive @xmath177 _ due to magnetophoresis_. secondly , the stationary branch @xmath295 as a general rule is located in the region of negative rayleigh numbers , i.e. , the branch determines the onset of convection in the binary mixture heated from _",
    "thermomagnetic mechanism of convection knows , however , neither the top nor the bottom : the magnetic rayleigh number @xmath296 is proportional to @xmath297 , so it is always positive .    .",

    "thus , convective instability of magnetized ferrofluids is strongly effected by the magnetophoretic and thermophoretic ( the soret effect ) transfer of magnetic grains .",
    "the most interesting consequence of the transfer is an opportunity to observe oscillatory convective instability .",
    "however , as we have already commented , to observe predicted oscillations one needs to satisfy certain experimental conditions .",
    "namely , the temperature difference must not be increased faster than the limit imposed by concentration diffusion . in the opposite case",
    ", a ferrofluid behaves like a pure fluid what results in stationary instability at the critical rayleigh number @xmath218 ; its dependence on @xmath77 for some magnitudes of @xmath211 is shown in fig . 6 . in conclusion",
    ", it is worth to remind that all our results are relevant to thin ferrofluid layers @xmath298 where magnetic mechanism of convection predominates over the buoyancy mechanism , and the characteristic diffusion time , @xmath235 , is not too long . to compare above - stated theoretical predictions with future experimental results one should perform a more precise analysis , which would satisfy realistic boundary conditions ( 4.1 ) , ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.8 ) instead of idealized boundary conditions ( 4.9 ) used in the paper",
