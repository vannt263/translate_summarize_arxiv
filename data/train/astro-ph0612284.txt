    "ap and bp stars are intermediate - mass main sequence stars that display strong photospheric abundance anomalies .",
    "in particular , iron peak elements can be strongly overabundant compared to solar : fe by + 1 dex and cr up to + 3 dex .",
    "si can also be overabundant by + 1 dex and rare earth elements , such as nd and eu , can be even more strongly over abundant in the star s photosphere .",
    "in addition to these strong peculiarities , ap and bp stars also possess strong magnetic fields ( @xmath1 kg ) that are ordered on large scales ; these are predominantly dipolar in structure .",
    "this is remarkable since intermediate mass stars do not possess the deep convective envelopes needed to power a conventional dynamo , as seen in lower mass stars .",
    "there certainly exists a link between the strong magnetic fields and the observed chemical peculiarities . in rough terms , the abundance anomalies are a result of the competing effects of radiative levitation and gravitational settling , producing a chemically stratified atmosphere",
    ". elements with a local accumulation near the surface of the star appear overabundant .",
    "the magnetic field is thought to provide additional stability to the atmosphere allowing horizontal inhomogeneities and vertical stratification to persist .",
    "however , this picture is still incomplete .",
    "the details of the stratification process and the effects of the magnetic field are not understood .",
    "as well , the origin of the magnetic field remains a mystery .",
    "perhaps most glaringly , the evolution of magnetic fields and chemical anomalies in ap / bp stars during the main sequence phase remains unknown .",
    "significant effort has gone into examining specific ap and bp stars : modelling chemical abundances , magnetic fields , and non - uniform distributions of elements both vertically and horizontally across a star s surface . despite a growing sample of",
    "well modelled ap / bp stars , our ability to describe general trends as these stars age is limited .",
    "determining the age of an isolated star to a high degree of accuracy can be difficult .",
    "moreover , ap / bp stars display abnormal photometric properties , which can greatly exacerbate errors in the dating of a star .",

    "this suggests that there may be a strongly inhomogeneous distribution of cr across the surface of this star .",
    "our uniform - abundance model provides a relatively poor fit to these complex profiles . in order to derive the abundance of cr",
    ", we verified that the equivalent widths of the observed and synthesized spectral lines were in good agreement .",
    "this technique of matching equivalent widths was used for fe as well , as lines of this element also appear to display slightly asymmetric line profiles .",
    "the resulting mean abundances for 15 elements are reported in table [ final_ab ] .",
    "a sample section of spectrum is shown in figure [ 162725_spec ] .",
    "hd 162725 exhibits strong overabundances of iron peak elements , as well as some rare earth elements such as nd and eu .",
    "si appears overabundant , however o , mg and ca are under abundant .",
    "hd 162305 is classified as a b9 star with a v magnitude of 7.81 .",
    "renson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) list this star as having a doubtful chemically peculiar nature .",
    "it was included in our study , as a likely ap star , due to its large @xmath110 photometric value ( maitzen & floquet , 1981 ) and unusual line profiles .",
    "our observation of this star has a very good peak signal - to - noise ratio of 420 .",
    "hd 162305 has broader lines then the previous 2 stars , and again asymmetries are clearly present in the high - resolution spectrum .",
    "the strong asymmetries are most obvious in the cr lines , there is a large flux increase in the centre of the line profile and both blue and red wings are significantly deeper .",
    "other elements also display asymmetries : fe lines tend to be deeper in the blue wing and ti lines rise significantly in the centre of the core .",
    "an effective temperature of 10500 k and surface gravity of 4.0 were adopted for the atlas9 model atmosphere .",
    "the notably broader lines of this star imply a significantly greater projected rotational velocity .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 of @xmath111 kms@xmath5is roughly three times larger for this star than for the previous two .",
    "since the total amount of light absorbed is independent of rotational broadening , the line depth will decrease as the line width grows . as a result , line cores in the spectrum of hd 162305 are closer to the noise level",
    ". additionally , any asymmetries in the line profile , due to inhomogeneous distributions of elements across the surface of the star , will be much more prominent in the spectrum of a faster rotating star .",
    "these two effects combine to increase the difficulty of the fitting procedure for hd 162305 .",
    "fitting @xmath0 was accomplished by focusing on the wings of a large number of lines ; the core was largely neglected due to line profile structure . in order to determine element abundances , we once again fit the equivalent widths of lines with weak blending .",
    "the best fit abundances are reported in table [ final_ab ] and a sample section of spectrum is shown in figure [ 162305_spec ] . in the photosphere of hd 162305 ,",
    "cr and mn are strongly overabundant , as is nd , while o and mg are underabundant .",
    "the fifth star , hd  320764 , is classified as a6 , and has a v magnitude of 8.93 .",
    "renson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) consider this star to be of a doubtful chemically peculiar nature .",
    "this star was included in our study , as possibly peculiar , do to its larger @xmath110 photometric value ( maitzen & floquet , 1981 ) .",
    "the spectrum of hd  320764 exhibits the broadest lines and a signal - to - noise ratio of 320 . despite the high signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the shallow lines of this star make noise more of a problem then in the other stars investigated . a temperature of 8750  k and surface gravity of 4.0 were adopted for the model atmosphere .",
    "a 1 kms@xmath5 microturbulence was used in the spectrum synthesis . if we were to increase this value to 2 kms@xmath5",
    ", this would result in a decrease in most abundances by about 0.2 dex .",
    "the @xmath0 determined by spectrum synthesis is 225 kms@xmath5 .",
    "such a large @xmath0 makes modelling very challenging due to the very shallow and heavily blended lines . in the spectrum of a star with lines",
    "this broad and shallow , continuum normalization becomes a large potential source of error and must be dealt with carefully .",
    "no clear asymmetries are seen in this spectrum . the fitting procedure focused on both the core and wings of the lines , although in this case drawing a distinction between wing and core is not very useful .",
    "it is very unusual for an ap star to have a @xmath0 value this large .",
    "modelling of the spectrum of this star shows near solar abundances for cr , fe , ti and ni with no clear overabundances of rare earth elements .",
    "the abundance of ca appears marginally greater than solar , however only three lines were used , all of which are particularly sensitive to microturbulence .",
    "if we were to use a microturbulence of 2 kms@xmath5 the abundance would fall to @xmath112 dex , well within uncertainty of solar . due to this sensitivity and the uncertainty in the microturbulence of hd  320764 ,",
    "the ca abundance presented here is somewhat more uncertain then that of other elements .",
    "although uncertain , the abundances derived for hd  320764 provide no evidence to suggest that the star is chemically peculiar .",
    "the derived abundances are reported in table [ final_ab ] and a sample section of spectrum is shown in figure [ 320764_spec ] .",

    "chemical abundances as well as projected rotation velocity have been determined for five confirmed members of ncg 6475 ( m7 ) .",
    "the derived chemical abundances are presented graphically in figure [ total_ab ] .",
    "three stars are clearly classical ap / bp stars , and the normal b9 star has been confirmed to have solar abundances .",
    "however , the supposed ap star hd  320764 appears to be a chemically normal a star .",
    "abundances and abundance upper limits have been found for a wide range of elements from c to eu , with typical @xmath103 uncertainties ( generally derived from the dispersion of abundances determined from multiple absorption lines ) of 0.3 dex .",
    "the chemically normal b star hd  162817 displays abundances that are within uncertainty of solar for essentially all elements .",
    "the three confirmed ap stars all show strong overabundances ( as compared to the sun and as compared to hd  162817 ) of cr and mn .",
    "only marginal overabundances are found for si , fe and ni , while ti is solar or marginally underabundant .",
    "the rare earths nd and eu are also overabundant when detected in the ap stars .",
    "the light elements o and mg are slightly underabundant .",
    "hd  320764 displays abundances that are within uncertainty of solar for all elements detected , except for ca and mn .",
    "mn is nearly within uncertainty of solar and based only on one spectral window .",
    "ca is also nearly within uncertainty of solar and the lines used are particularly sensitive to the choice of microturbulence , making the abundance somewhat less certain than that of other elements studied .    the structure and strong asymmetries observed in many lines of hd  162576 , hd  162725 and hd  162305 support the conclusion that these stars are magnetic ap / bp stars .",
    "complex line profiles including many double - peaked profiles imply complicated surface abundance distributions .",
    "the abundances presented in this paper therefore represent averages of these complex distributions over the observable hemisphere of star at the time of observation .",
    "additional high resolution spectra of these three stars are necessary if the surface distributions are to be mapped .    the overabundances of cr and eu are marginally greater for the cooler ap star hd  162725 than for the two hotter ap stars , consistent with the cooler temperatures seen in srcreu ap stars when compared to si ap stars in the field ( wolff 1967 ) .",
    "the values of cr overabundance seen , and the trend with temperature , are consistent with the pattern observed by ryabchikova et al .",
    "there is no clear relationship between overabundance of elements and rotation within the three chemically peculiar stars .",
    "however , it is notable that the chemically normal stars on average have significantly higher @xmath0 then the ap stars .",
    "this is consistent with published results , for example abt & morrell ( 1995 ) .",
    "hd  162576 and hd  162725 have identical age and initial composition , as well as the same @xmath0 , mass , and their derived effective temperatures are only marginally different ( @xmath123  k ) .",
    "a period analysis shows that the stars have similar periods at 3.43 and 4.459 days respectively ( catalano & renson 1998 and renson & catalano 2001 ) . with our adopted uncertainties ,",
    "the abundances of most elements are very similar in these two stars .",
    "there are some marginally detectable differences : si appears to be less abundant in hd  162725 then in hd  162576 , while ba is more abundant .",
    "cr and fe may be more abundant in hd  162725 as well .",
    "the similarities in derived abundances between these two stars suggest that age , mass , rotation speed , and possibly magnetic field strength may be enough to uniquely determine a set of chemical peculiarities present in a late - b star .",
    "the slight differences in abundance between the two stars may be related to the difference in rotation period , phase of rotation , or possibly magnetic field , between the two stars .",
    "hd  162305 and hd  162576 have identical age , initial composition , effective temperatures , and masses , but @xmath0 differs by more than a factor of 3 .",
    "these stars display many similarities , but there are some significant abundance differences ( e.g. @xmath124 dex for ca , @xmath125 dex for ba ) . assuming that the true rotational velocities of these stars differ by a similar factor , it could be that these differences reflect the effects of rotational mixing .",
    "hd  162305 is also nearly identical to hd  162725 except in @xmath0 .",
    "both stars have identical age and initial chemical composition , as well as very similar masses and temperatures .",
    "there are many similarities between these two stars , as with hd  162576 , but there are also some significant differences , particularly the @xmath126 dex difference in ca , and smaller differences in cr and mn .",
    "a study of the rotation periods of the five stars in this paper would be very useful , as it would allow for much more definite comments on the effect of rotational mixing in this sample of stars .",
    "even more remarkably , hd  162305 and hd  162817 ( our chemically normal comparison star ) have formally identical @xmath0 and only marginally different effective temperatures , as well as identical age and initial chemical composition . however , these stars display strong differences in the photospheric abundances of chemical elements ( e.g. @xmath127 dex for cr , @xmath128 dex for ba ) .",
    "presumably the difference results from the presence of a magnetic field , but this begs the question : what distinguishes the presence of magnetic field in co - eval , co - environmental stars with similar masses , temperatures and rotation speeds ?    some major questions about ap stars remain .",
    "in particular how their magnetic fields , rotation and chemical abundances evolve over time is not well understood .",
    "temporal changes in rotation speed and abundance patterns potentially can provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms producing the abundance anomalies and magnetic fields seen in ap stars . in that context , this paper serves as a first step in a larger effort to examine trends in the evolution of ap stars .",
    "the use of cluster stars allows us , in principle , to remove the competing effects of age and environment , and allows for precise determination of mass and evolutionary state , particularly for stars in the earlier half of their lifetime . through the use of a number of clusters with different ages",
    ", one can construct a picture of evolutionary trends .",
    "thus the detailed chemical abundances of all ap stars , within a single cluster , presented in this study provides important groundwork for a description of the formation and evolution of abundances of ap stars .",
