    "[ [ section ] ]    an integral affine structure on a manifold of dimension @xmath3 is given by a torsion - free flat connection with the monodromy reduced to @xmath4 .",
    "there are two basic situations in which integral affine structures occur naturally .",
    "one is the case of classical integrable systems described briefly in section 3 .",
    "most interesting for us is a class of examples arising from analytic manifolds over non - archimedean fields which is discussed in section 4 .",
    "it is motivated by the approach to mirror symmetry suggested in [ koso ] .",
    "we recall it in section 5 . from our point of view",
    "manifolds with integral affine structure appear in mirror symmetry in two ways .",
    "one considers the gromov - hausdorff collapse of degenerating families of calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "the limiting space can be interpreted either as a contraction ( see section 4.1 ) of an analytic manifold over a non - archimedean field of laurent series @xmath5 , or as a base of a fibration of a calabi - yau manifold by lagrangian tori ( with respect to the symplectic khler 2-form ) . on a dense open subset of the limiting space one",
    "gets two integral affine structures associated with two interpretations , the non - archimedean one and the symplectic one .",
    "mirror dual family of degenerating calabi - yau manifolds should have metrically the same gromov - hausdorff limit , with the roles of two integral affine structures interchanged .",
    "very interesting question arises : how to reconstruct these families of calabi - yau manifolds from the corresponding manifolds with integral affine structures ?",
    "this question was one of the main motivations for present work .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    our approach to the reconstruction of analytic calabi - yau manifolds from real manifolds with integral affine structure can be illustrated in the following toy - model example .",
    "let @xmath6 be a circle equipped with the induced from @xmath7 affine structure .",
    "we equip @xmath8 with the canonical sheaf @xmath9 of noetherian @xmath10-algebras . by definition , for an open interval",
    "@xmath11 algebra @xmath12 consists of formal series @xmath13 such that @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is any point in a connected component of the pre - image of @xmath16 in @xmath17 , the choice of a different component @xmath18 corresponds to the substitution @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding analytic space is the tate elliptic curve @xmath20 , and there is a continuous map @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .    in the case of k3 surfaces",
    "one starts with @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding integral affine structure is well - defined on the set @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are distinct points .",
    "similarly to the above toy - model example one can construct the canonical sheaf @xmath25 of algebras , an open @xmath1-dimensional smooth analytic surface @xmath26 with the trivial canonical bundle ( calabi - yau manifold ) , and a continuous projection @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "the problem is to find a sheaf @xmath29 whose restriction to @xmath30 is locally isomorphic to @xmath25 , an analytic compact k3 surface @xmath31 , and a continuous projection @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "we call this problem ( in general case ) the lifting problem and discuss it in section 7",
    ". unfortunately we do not know the conditions one should impose on singularities of the affine structure , so that the lifting problem would have a solution .",
    "we consider a special case of k3 surfaces in sections 8 - 11 . here",
    "the solution is non - trivial and depends on data which are not visible in the statement of the problem .",
    "they are motivated by mirror symmetry and consist , roughly speaking , of an infinite collection of trees embedded into @xmath30 with the tail vertices belonging to the set @xmath34 .",
    "the sheaf @xmath25 has to be modified by means of automorphisms assigned to every edge of a tree and then glued together with certain model sheaf near each singular point @xmath35 .    informally speaking , we break @xmath30 endowed with the sheaf @xmath25 into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and then glue them back together in a slightly deformed way .",
    "the idea of such a construction was proposed several years ago independently by k.  fukaya and the first author .",
    "the realization of this idea was hindered by a poor understanding of singularities of the gromov - hausdorff collapse and by the lack of knowledge of certain open gromov - witten invariants ( `` instanton corrections '' ) .",
    "the last problem is circumvented here ( and in fact solved ) with the use of some pro - nilpotent lie group ( see section 10 ) .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the relationship between k3 surfaces and singular affine structures on @xmath2 is of very general origin . starting with a projective analytic calabi - yau manifold @xmath31 over a complete non - archimedean local field @xmath36 one can canonically construct a pl manifold @xmath37 called the skeleton of @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath31 is a generic k3 surface then @xmath37 is @xmath2 .",
    "we discuss skeleta in section 6.6 .",
    "the group of birational automorphisms of @xmath31 acts on @xmath37 by integral pl transformations .",
    "for @xmath38 we obtain an action of an arithmetic subgroup of @xmath0 on @xmath2 .",
    "further examples should come from calabi - yau manifolds with large groups of birational automorphisms .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    we have already discussed the content of the paper .",
    "let us summarize it .",
    "the paper is naturally divided into three parts .",
    "part 1 is devoted to generalities on integral affine structures and examples , including mirror symmetry .",
    "motivated by string theory we use term a - model ( resp .",
    "b - model ) for examples arising in symplectic ( resp .",
    "analytic ) geometry .",
    "in part 2 we discuss the concept of singular integral affine structure , including an affine version of gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "the latter implies that if all singularities of an integral affine structure on @xmath2 are standard ( so - called focus - focus singularities ) then there are exactly @xmath39 singular points .",
    "part 2 also contains a statement of the lifting problem and discussion of flat coordinates on the moduli space of complex calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "we expect that under mild conditions on the singular integral affine structure there exists a solution of the lifting problem , which is unique as long as we fix periods ( see sections 7.3 and 7.4 for more details ) .",
    "most technical part 3 contains a solution of the lifting problem for k3 surfaces .",
    "we construct the corresponding analytic k3 surface as a ringed space .",
    "the sheaf of analytic functions is defined differently near a singular point and far from the singular set .",
    "it turns out that the  naive \" candidate for the sheaf on the complement of the singular set has to be modified before we can glue it with the model sheaf near each singular point .",
    "this modification procedure involves a new set of data ( we call them _ lines _ ) .",
    "we also discuss the group of automorphisms of the canonical sheaf which preserve the symplectic form .",
    "we use this group in order to modify the  naive \" sheaf along each line .",
    "the paper has two appendices .",
    "first one contains some background on analytic spaces , while the second one is devoted to torelli theorem .    _",
    "acknowledgements_. we are grateful to ilya zharkov and mark gross for useful discussions .",
    "second author thanks clay mathematics institute for supporting him as a fellow and ihes for excellent research and living conditions .",
    "let us recall that an affine structure on manifold @xmath41 ( smooth , of dimension @xmath3 ) is given by a torsion - free flat connection @xmath42 on the tangent bundle @xmath43 .",
    "we will give below three equivalent definitions of the notion of an integral affine structure .",
    "an integral affine structure on @xmath41 ( @xmath40-affine structure for short ) is an affine structure @xmath42 together with a @xmath42-covariant lattice of maximal rank @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath41 carries a @xmath40-affine structure then for any point @xmath45 there exist small neighborhood @xmath16 , local coordinate system @xmath46 in @xmath16 such that @xmath47 in coordinates @xmath46 , and the lattice @xmath48 is a free abelian group generated by the tangent vectors @xmath49 .",
    "let us call _ @xmath40-affine _ such a coordinate system in @xmath16 ( sometimes we will call such @xmath16 a @xmath40-affine chart ) .",
    "for a covering of @xmath41 by @xmath40-affine charts the transition functions belong ( locally ) to @xmath50 .",
    "explicitly , a change of coordinates is given by the formula    @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "hence , definition 1 is equivalent to the following    a @xmath40-affine structure on @xmath41 is given by a maximal atlas of charts such that the transition functions belong locally to @xmath50 .    in the above definition @xmath41 is just a topological manifold , @xmath53-structure on it can be reconstructed canonically from @xmath40-affine structure .",
    "we can restate the notion of @xmath40-affine structure in the language of sheaves of affine functions .",
    "we say that a real - valued function @xmath54 on @xmath55 is @xmath40-affine if it has the form    @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath41 is a subsheaf @xmath60 of the sheaf of continuous functions on @xmath41 , such that the pair @xmath61 is locally isomorphic to @xmath62 .",
    "equivalence of the last two definitions follows from the observation that a homeomorphism between two open domains in @xmath55 preserving the sheaf @xmath59 is given by the same formula @xmath63 as the change of coordinates between two @xmath40-affine coordinate systems .      with a given affine structure on @xmath41",
    "we can associate a flat affine connection @xmath64 ( see [ kn ] ) .",
    "the corresponding parallel transport acts on tangent spaces by affine transformations . for a @xmath40-affine structure",
    "the monodromy of @xmath64 belongs to @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath65 we have a monodromy representation @xmath66 alternatively , we can define the monodromy representation by covering a loop in @xmath41 by @xmath40-affine coordinate charts and composing the corresponding transition functions .",
    "notice that a @xmath40-affine structure on @xmath41 gives rise to a class @xmath67\\in h^1(y , t^{{{\\bf z}}}\\otimes { { { \\bf r}}})=h^1(y , t_y^\\nabla)\\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the subsheaf of @xmath42-flat sections is not necessarily connected . ] .",
