    "the development of methods to produce atomic and molecular samples with precisely controlled translational and internal degrees of freedom has received considerable attention in recent years , with particular emphasis on the generation of cold ( @xmath3 ) and ultracold ( @xmath4 ) samples .",
    "this interest in the study of cold molecules is motivated by applications in a broad range of disciplines  @xcite , including the study of collision processes and chemical reactions in a temperature regime where quantum - mechanical phenomena may dominate the reaction dynamics , high - precision spectroscopy , quantum information processing and quantum simulations , and the study of exotic quantum phases arising from the long - range anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction between polar molecules .    amongst the methods developed for",
    "the production of cold molecules ( for an overview , see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , those based on the deceleration of supersonic molecular beams are particularly suited to collision experiments  @xcite : the final velocity of the decelerated particles is tunable over a wide range with a narrow velocity spread  @xcite , the deceleration process is internal - state selective  @xcite , and the initial phase - space density is preserved by operating the decelerator in a phase - stable manner  @xcite .",
    "depending on the characteristics of the species of interest , multistage stark deceleration  @xcite , rydberg - stark deceleration  @xcite , multistage zeeman deceleration  @xcite , or optical deceleration  @xcite may be best suited .",
    "multistage zeeman deceleration relies on the interaction between paramagnetic species and time - dependent inhomogeneous magnetic fields , and is therefore particularly attractive for open - shell systems such as molecular radicals and metastable atoms and molecules . in this article",
    ", we present results on the deceleration of a supersonic beam of neon atoms in the metastable @xmath5 @xmath6 state using a 91-stage zeeman decelerator .",
    "because of their favorable ratio of magnetic moment to mass and the straightforward detection of beams of metastable atoms , light metastable rare - gas atoms are well suited to multistage zeeman deceleration , and beams of such atoms have been used by several groups to characterize their zeeman decelerators  @xcite . moreover , cold decelerated beams of metastable rare - gas atoms are of interest in the study of penning ionization processes  @xcite with a high energy resolution at low collision energies  @xcite .",
    "metastable neon has been laser cooled and trapped  @xcite .",
    "multistage zeeman deceleration also provides a means to prepare atomic or molecular samples in a selected magnetic sublevel , which may be used in collision experiments and complement existing techniques to prepare aligned and oriented samples ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this article describes the extension of our modular high - repetition - rate zeeman decelerator design , which has previously been employed for deceleration and trapping of hydrogen and deuterium atoms  @xcite , to the deceleration of heavier species , and also presents the characterization of the velocity distribution of the decelerated samples .",
    "characteristic features of this decelerator , next to its modular nature , are its high repetition rate ( ) and the solenoid design which enables one to easily calculate magnetic field distributions .",
    "the latter advantage is of crucial importance for particle trajectory simulations and their use in the optimization of the deceleration process .",
    "an introduction into design considerations relevant to multistage zeeman deceleration will be given first , followed by a detailed description of the individual deceleration stages , their assembly into modules , and the integration of the modules into the multistage decelerator .",
    "the electronics circuits developed and used to pulse high currents through the deceleration solenoids with short rise and fall times are also described .",
    "in a multistage zeeman decelerator , the longitudinal velocity of low - field - seeking particles in a supersonic beam is reduced by converting kinetic energy into potential energy through repeated application of pulsed inhomogeneous magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "typical laboratory magnetic fields , which can be reliably produced and rapidly switched with conventional solenoids , are on the order of a few tesla .",
    "these give rise to zeeman shifts @xmath7 for a magnetic moment of one bohr magneton ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "to give an example , the kinetic energy of a particle of mass number @xmath9 propagating at a velocity of amounts to @xmath10 .",
    "many successive deceleration stages are therefore needed to bring even small atomic or molecular systems to a standstill . moreover , a phase - stable operation of the decelerator is essential to maintain the initial phase - space density while decelerating parts of the supersonic beam to the desired final velocity  @xcite .    a simplified energy level diagram of the metastable states of neon relevant to the experiment is shown in fig .",

    "the zeeman shift of the metastable @xmath6 state is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the magnetic field and @xmath13  @xcite . at a magnetic field of , reached in our decelerator at a phase angle of ,",
    "the low - field - seeking state @xmath14 used in the deceleration experiments is subject to a zeeman shift of about .          a schematic representation of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",

    "the main components are a pulsed source producing a supersonic beam of metastable neon atoms , the modular zeeman decelerator , and the electronics driving the current through the solenoids to generate strong magnetic fields for deceleration . in the design of the decelerator and its electronics ,",
    "the following aspects have been considered to make the experiment flexible and versatile :    1 .",
    "the decelerator was set up in a modular way to enable the deceleration of different atomic or molecular systems .",
    "the number of deceleration stages required to fully decelerate a given species depends on its magnetic - moment - to - mass ratio .",
    "for example , 12 deceleration stages are needed for h  @xcite , 24 deceleration stages for d  @xcite , and around 90 deceleration stages for metastable ne .",
    "2 .   collision and high - resolution spectroscopic experiments with pulsed supersonic beams are typically performed at repetition rates between .",
    "ideally , the repetition rate of the decelerator should lie in this range , which places strong constraints on the cooling of the solenoids .",
    "3 .   to keep the number of deceleration stages low , the kinetic energy removed at each deceleration stage should be as large as possible .",
    "4 .   to avoid particle loss by nonadiabatic transitions at low field , a quantization field must be maintained along the entire trajectories of the decelerated particles  @xcite .",
    "the deceleration efficiency benefits from precise knowledge of the spatial and temporal shapes of the magnetic field pulses .",
    "in addition , `` clean '' magnetic - field pulses simplify the calculation of deceleration pulse sequences .",
    "metallic materials close to the solenoids should therefore be avoided to minimize the influence of eddy currents . moreover ,",
    "high - permeability materials , which can be used for field - enhancement purposes  @xcite , result in a rest magnetization that is difficult to quantify .",
    "6 .   whereas electronic devices for the fast switching of high voltages are commercially available , dedicated fast switching electronics for pulsing high currents through inductive loads are required .",
    "7 .   a high vacuum should be maintained in the deceleration beam line to avoid losses by collisions with the background gas and with particles not accepted by the decelerator  @xcite .",
    "the detection of metastable atoms or molecules in a beam experiment is straightforward : if the internal energy of the metastable state exceeds the work function of the micro - channel - plate ( mcp ) detector , an electron current is generated upon impact on the mcp . with an internal energy of",
    ", the @xmath6  state of ne clearly fulfills this requirement .",
    "depending on the specific measurement , the mcps used in the experiments described here were assembled in a standard chevron configuration for the measurement of time - of - flight ( tof ) profiles , or additionally equipped with a phosphor screen for imaging the radial distribution of the decelerated atoms with a ccd camera .",
    "compared to detection by photoionization with a pulsed laser , which was used in the zeeman deceleration of h and d @xcite , this detection method has the advantage of giving a complete time - of - flight trace without the need of scanning the delay time of the laser with respect to the nozzle opening time .",
    "hence , data acquisition is fast , and a wide parameter range can be sampled in a short time .",
    "this advantage is particularly important during the initial optimization of the decelerator and the deceleration pulse sequences .",
    "neon is expanded from a reservoir at a stagnation pressure of into vacuum through the diameter orifice of a pulsed even - lavie valve  @xcite . to increase the density in the beam and reduce the initial speed of the atoms",
    ", the body of the valve is thermally connected to a liquid - nitrogen reservoir by copper braids and held at a temperature of about . to populate the metastable @xmath6  state ,",
    "a discharge is operated in the expansion region  @xcite .",
    "the distance between the nozzle orifice and the discharge is kept as short as possible to produce the metastable atoms in a high - density region , which was found to be efficient and also cools the beam in the expansion .",
    "for this purpose , a thin metal tip , to which a dc voltage of is applied , is placed away from the ceramic front plate of the valve body , with the grounded metal poppet of the valve acting as the second discharge electrode .",
    "the tip is radially displaced from the symmetry axis of the nozzle to avoid obstruction of the supersonic beam . to efficiently operate the discharge at this low voltage and minimize heating of the beam",
    ", the discharge is seeded with thermal electrons continuously emitted from a filament ( agar scientific a054c , tungsten wire , ac current up to rms ) placed downstream from the nozzle .    to characterize the supersonic beam ,",
    "we have recorded the time - of - flight distribution of the metastable neon atoms impinging on the mcp at the exit of the decelerator , about from the nozzle . from such time - of - flight measurements ,",
    "the mean velocity of the metastable neon atoms was determined to be .",
    "further properties of the discharge source can be determined by threshold photoionization spectroscopy using a pulsed dye laser .",
    "after propagation through the decelerator , only the metastable @xmath6  and @xmath15  states are expected to be populated in the beam .",
    "scanning the laser over their ionization thresholds at ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath6 )  @xcite , and recording the ion yield , we found a ratio of population in the @xmath6 state to that in the @xmath15 state of 5:1 , which corresponds to the degeneracy factors of these energy levels . because the state @xmath6 , @xmath14 has the largest magnetic moment it is the most convenient state for deceleration , and the deceleration pulse sequences were optimized for its properties .",
    "assumining an equal initial population of all magnetic sublevels , the atoms in the @xmath14 state represent only one sixth of the population of metastable atoms .",
    "in the measurements , neon gas with natural isotopic composition was used , the most abundant isotopes being @xmath1 ( 90.5% ) and @xmath2 ( 9.3% ) . in most experiments ,",
    "the deceleration pulse sequences were generated for @xmath1 .",
    "the occurrence of two different isotopes in the beam , however , offers the possibility of investigating the selectivity of multistage zeeman deceleration on the magnetic - moment - to - mass ratio .",
    "this was done by applying deceleration pulse sequences generated for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and detecting the cold decelerated atoms in a mass - selective manner .",
    "the deceleration solenoids are at the heart of the multistage zeeman decelerator . in their design and optimization ,",
    "the following factors have been considered .    1 .   the open area of the decelerator , determined by the free inner diameter of the solenoids ,",
    "should be matched to the profile of the supersonic beam .",
    "the dimensions are therefore similar to those of the electrodes in a multistage stark decelerator .",
    "2 .   the solenoids should produce a large decelerating field gradient on axis and provide transverse focusing of the beam .",
    "the length of the solenoids should be kept as short as possible to maximise the energy removed per unit length .",
    "the length of the solenoids should be matched to the initial speed of the supersonic beam and to the achievable switching times of the magnetic deceleration fields . for efficient phase - stable deceleration",
    ", the beam should not penetrate too far into the solenoids during the switch - off time of the field .",
    "the individual deceleration solenoids were made of enameled wire having a copper - core diameter of ( elektrisola xhtw , abp15 , grade 1b ) .",
    "the wire was wound in four layers with 62 windings in total , with a free inner solenoid diameter of , an outer diameter of , and a length of .",
    "the length of these solenoids was chosen as a compromise between achieving the maximum on - axis field for a given number of windings per unit length at this inner diameter while at the same time maximizing the deceleration that can be achieved per unit length .",

    "near the center of the solenoid , the field is concave , which gives rise to radial focusing forces . at larger distances from the center ,",
    "the field is convex , and forces in the radial direction are defocusing .",
    "this alternation plays an important role in the transverse dynamics in the multistage zeeman decelerator as discussed by wiederkehr et al .",

    "when a current of is pulsed through a solenoid , an electrical power of is dissipated . at a repetition rate of the decelerator of and a typical pulse duration of",
    ", a heat load of per solenoid must be removed by the cooling system . to efficiently cool the solenoids and simplify the construction , 12 individual solenoids are assembled into one module as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup ] .",
    "within such a module , the supersonic beam propagates inside a quartz glass tube ( inner diameter , wall thickness ) representing the evacuated beamline .",
    "the solenoids , separated by ceramic ( bnp2 ) spacers at a center - to - center distance of , are glued on the outside of this glass tube with a heat - conducting epoxy ( aremco - bond 860 ) .",
    "the epoxy prevents mechanical distortions when high currents are pulsed and protects the outermost layer of the solenoid from abrasion by the circulating cooling water .",
    "the glass tube assembled with the solenoids is then inserted into a plastic casing which also houses electrical feedthroughs to supply the current to the solenoids .",
    "this design allows the immersion of the solenoids in circulating cooling water to efficiently remove the heat , such that the decelerator can be operated at a high repetition rate of .",
    "before the supersonic beam enters the decelerator , it passes a diameter skimmer placed downstream from the nozzle .",
    "the nozzle is positioned in the source vacuum chamber with good optical access , which is necessary when the species to be decelerated are produced by either photoexcitation or photolysis from a precursor molecule .",
    "the size of the skimmer orifice is chosen so as to match the transverse profile of the supersonic beam to the radial acceptance of the decelerator . to reduce the gas load from the source in the decelerator and avoid losses by collisions with the background gas  @xcite ,",
    "the beam first propagates through a tower extending above an evacuated volume ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : exp_setup ] ) .",
    "the large vacuum chamber , covering the full length of the decelerator , is evacuated by two turbo molecular pumps to a pressure in the low range .    for the deceleration of ne ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "five modules of length , each equipped with 12 solenoids , and one additional -long module with 31 deceleration solenoids   were used . as shown in fig .  [ fig : exp_setup ] , the modules are attached with viton o - ring seals to the towers .",
    "therefore , modules can be added or removed easily to adapt the length of the decelerator to different species .",
    "the 12-solenoid modules are similar to the ones used for the deceleration and trapping of h and d atoms , and were designed so as to permit deceleration of h atoms to a standstill  @xcite .",
    "interrupting the sequence of deceleration stages by the -long propagation distances through the towers is necessary to maintain a high vacuum in the decelerator , but it introduces additional technical difficulties . in the case of neon , only atoms in the @xmath16 state are efficiently decelerated . to avoid nonadiabatic transitions of the low - field - seeking states near zero field , which would cause particle loss  @xcite ,",
    "it is important to maintain a quantization field along the complete trajectory through the decelerator .",
    "within the modules , this is achieved by switching on the field of the next solenoid just before the field of the active solenoid is switched off . in each tower ,",

    "the significant natural abundance of two stable isotopes ( @xmath1 : 90.5% , @xmath2 : 9.3% ) of neon opens up the possibility to investigate whether multistage zeeman deceleration can be used to separate species of different magnetic - moment - to - mass ratio . for this purpose ,",
