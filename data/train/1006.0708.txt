    "thermodynamical properties of physical systems are described in statistical mechanics by the ensemble theory .",
    "its development rests on the existence of both additivity and thermodynamic limit , which are essential ingredients to describe critical phenomena .",
    "the existence of a thermodynamic limit is related to the extensivity property which is required in order to obtain meaningful physical results in that limit @xcite .",
    "large enough systems with short - range interactions present the additivity property for extensive quantities like energy and entropy .",
    "additivity means that when we consider the energy , or any other extensive quantity of a system , and divide the system into two or more macroscopic parts , the total energy is still the sum of the energies of those parts . from theoretical backgrounds ,",
    "the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles approximate the microcanonical ensemble in the limit of infinitely large number of particles , where surface effects and fluctuations can be disregarded with respect to the bulk mean values @xcite .",
    "there is definitely more consensus around the microcanonical ensemble as the most fundamental one .",
    "thus , the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles are taken as approximations for the microcanonical ensemble whenever the full equivalence does not hold . in cases where full consistency of statistical ensembles holds for systems that undergo phase transitions",
    ", it is found that finite - size scaling relations still place the microcanonical approach as the fundamental one @xcite .",
    "there are many examples of systems whose microcanonical equilibrium properties contrast to the ones obtained in the canonical ensemble .",
    "differences in the equilibrium properties have been described analytically for systems with long - range interactions @xcite , which are consequences of the nonconcavity of the entropy as a function of energy @xcite .",
    "the nonequivalence appears for those systems when the canonical ensemble exhibits a first - order phase transition and this has been demonstrated by means of the large deviation theory @xcite .",
    "such nonequivalence results in uncommon features like temperature discontinuity and negative specific heat in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will be dealing with a less popular ensemble , the extended gaussian ensemble ( ege ) @xcite , which is constructed upon the gaussian ensemble @xcite .",
    "they are known to present a smooth interpolation between their limiting behaviors , corresponding to the microcanonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "recently , the ege solution was obtained for the blume - capel ( bc ) model with infinite - range interactions @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations illustrate this limiting behavior in a model with a tricritical point . this tricritical point",
    "does not coincide numerically in the two standard ensembles . here , we explicitly show how the microcanonical energy equilibrium states related to the metastable and unstable canonical solutions for the blume - capel model are recovered from ege , which presents a concave `` extended '' entropy .",
    "moreover , the discontinuous microcanonical solution is also investigated and the metastable and unstable lines are also obtained from ege .",
    "the content of our presentation is as follows .",
    "the ege analytical solution for the bc model is reviewed in the next section .",
    "analytical and numerical results for thermodynamical quantities characterizing this ensemble are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we summarize the results of this methodology in identifying the region of nonequivalence of ensembles only from the ege point of view .",
    "the ege is defined by the condition @xmath0 and probability density @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the normalization constant , which is the corresponding partition function in ege @xcite . as usual",
    ", @xmath3 is the density of states . here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are parameters , and @xmath6 stands for the mean energy , which is @xmath5 and @xmath4 dependent , @xmath7 . the extended gaussian ensemble is a particular case in a class of ensembles defined by functions @xmath8 @xcite , where the quadratic form @xmath9 is a convenient choice .",
    "the mean energy @xmath6 can be obtained from the extended gibbs s measure , @xmath10    this ensemble has two important limits .",
    "the canonical results correspond to @xmath11 and in this case the parameter @xmath5 identifies the inverse thermodynamical temperature , @xmath12 . on the other hand , the limit @xmath13 corresponds to the microcanonical case .",
    "this can be seen as @xmath14 through the use of the dirac s delta sequence in the gaussian form @xcite .",
    "the finite @xmath4 case presents an intermediary thermal description between the known limiting ensembles .",
    "all thermodynamical quantities can be defined in this ensemble as well .",
    "the extended thermodynamical potential is analogously defined to the canonical ensemble , @xmath15 . from here , the derivative at fixed value @xmath4 gives the mean energy , @xmath16 which parallels that of the usual canonical approach .",
    "the extended heat capacity is @xcite @xmath17 .",
    "let us now consider the blume - capel model @xcite , a particular case of the blume - emery - griffiths model @xcite . here , we work with its infinite - range interaction version , @xmath18 where @xmath19 . the couplings @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the exchange and crystal - field interactions , respectively .",
    "this is a well studied model , which presents a rich phase diagram in the @xmath22 plane .",
    "it exhibits a first - order phase transition line , tricritical point , and a second - order phase transition line .",
    "the critical properties of the bc model have been studied analytically in both the microcanonical @xcite and canonical ensembles @xcite .",
    "the bc model has become an outstanding model for what concerns the nonequivalence of ensembles .",
    "the canonical and microcanonical ensembles do not yield the same phase diagram for the first - order critical line @xcite .",
    "the canonical tricritical point occurs at @xmath23 , which gives origin to the canonical first - order phase transition line for larger values of @xmath24 ( and lower values of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the microcanonical solution identifies the tricritical point at @xmath26 .    the ege analytical solution @xcite is obtained from the extended partition function by means of hubbard - stratonovich transformations .",
    "to this end , we introduce the order parameters magnetization @xmath27 , and the quadrupole moment @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the number of sites with up and down spins .",
    "also , let @xmath31 be the total number of zero spins , then @xmath32 is the total number of spins in the system .",
    "therefore , the extended partition function reads @xmath33 here , it is convenient to work with the intensive quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "let us also define @xmath36 and @xmath37 the energy per site , following the authors in @xcite .",
    "first of all , we recall the ege solution for @xmath13 , which yields the known microcanonical ensemble results . the extended partition function must be well - behaved in this limit .",
    "thus , it is required in equation ( [ iv_9 ] ) that @xmath38 , which becomes a constraint equation for the mean energy @xmath39 as @xmath13 .",
    "the thermodynamic limit @xmath40 can be evaluated and one obtains the thermodynamical potential per site @xmath41 ,    \\label{f_noneq}\\ ] ] as a function of mean energy per site @xmath39 and , parameters @xmath5 and mean magnetization @xmath42 .",
    "the term inside the brackets is the correct microcanonical entropy @xmath43 obtained in @xcite as a function of @xmath39 and @xmath42 .",
    "the entropy is an even function of @xmath42 and a nonconcave function of independent variables @xmath42 and @xmath39 .",
    "the nonconcave behavior is the necessary condition for metastability and instability in the canonical states @xcite and gives origin to the nonequivalence of ensembles ( microcanonical and canonical ) .",
    "the consequences on the thermodynamical quantities specific heat and specific susceptibility have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the solution for finite @xmath4 describes up to what extension one recovers the microcanonical stable states .",
    "the full equivalence of these results with the stable states of the microcanonical ensemble is achieved for _ finite _ @xmath4 only for @xmath24 between the canonical and the microcanonical tricritical points . for couplings",
    "@xmath24 larger than the microcanonical tricritical point , i.e. , on the microcanonical first - order transition line , one needs @xmath44 for such full recovery of the microcanonical states @xcite .",
    "the finite @xmath4 solution for the thermodynamical potential per site reads @xmath45    the ege analytical solution poses a clear way of studying the formation of stable energy - dependent microcanonical states as the parameter @xmath4 increases .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to draw the ege solutions to observe the discontinuous microcanonical transition .",
    "this will be illustrated in the next section .",
    "the lack of ensemble equivalence is a consequence of a nonconcave entropy . as discussed in @xcite , the possible stable states , labeled by @xmath39 , are the ones defined by the microcanonical entropy @xmath46 .",
    "if those values of @xmath39 are not global minima of the canonical thermodynamical potential per site as we vary the temperature , then we do not find such correspondence between these states in both ensembles .",
    "local minima and local maxima in the canonical thermodynamical potential per site are , respectively , metastable and unstable states .    .",

    "the values of @xmath24 are in both canonical and microcanonical first - order phase transition regions.,width=288 ]    to see how the nonconcave entropy for the bc model induces this nonequivalence of ensembles , we initially evaluate the caloric curve @xmath47 _ versus _",
    "@xmath39 , in the canonical limit . to this end",
    ", we calculate the equilibrium solutions of @xmath48 for @xmath11 .",
    "the equilibrium solutions are easily obtained in this limit and are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows caloric curves for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "notice that the point @xmath49 , although close to the canonical tricritical point , is still in the second - order phase transition region according to both canonical and microcanonical predictions .",
    "the points @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are in the canonical first - order phase transition region , but they are in the second - order region from the microcanonical point of view .",
    "figure 2 shows caloric curves for @xmath24 in a region where both ensembles present first - order phase transition lines .",
    "notice that we have not drawn in those figures horizontal lines corresponding to the canonical maxwell construction .",
    "such constructions can be appreciated in @xcite for some values of @xmath24 .",
    "the missed stable microcanonical states are the ones related to the gaps in @xmath39 in both figures .",
    "we anticipate that the presentation of those stable microcanonical states is left to figure 4 , while in figure 5 we included all the equilibrium solutions .",
    "the ege equilibrium states for finite @xmath4 can be obtained by solving the extremum equations for @xmath48 .",
    "we call attention to the fact that the microcanonical constraint for the specific quantities is not enforced here , the variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 are treated as independent variables in this approach .",
    "the linear term in @xmath4 , equation ( [ phi_gamma ] ) , can be seen as a constrained equation leading to the microcanonical ensemble only for @xmath13 .    as done in @xcite",
    ", the desired solutions must satisfy equation ( [ eq : u ] ) , @xmath54 , and the extremum conditions @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , for a fixed @xmath39 .",
    "the stability criterion in the canonical ensemble for the bc model is nicely discussed in @xcite .",
    "we must observe that the solutions for the three equations above are not stable for all @xmath4 .",
    "since the analytical expression @xmath57 comes from a saddle - point approximation , one needs to study the stability of those ege solutions as a function of @xmath42 and @xmath53 . to this end , the determinant of the hessian matrix , @xmath58 is analyzed in the @xmath47 versus @xmath39 plane as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "this amounts to exploring which points @xmath59 minimize @xmath57 for fixed @xmath47 and @xmath39 , and satisfy the condition @xmath60 .",
    "ege temperatures for some values of @xmath4 with @xmath61 .",
    "a finite @xmath62 is necessary to recover all microcanonical states.,width=288 ]    figure 3 collects our results of stable points for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "that behavior is illustrated for @xmath63 , a coupling close to the microcanonical tricritical point and on the canonical first - order critical line , but still on the second - order critical line according to the microcanonical calculations .",
    "this figure shows that , as @xmath4 increases , one recovers the microcanonical solution .",
    "it can be shown that for sufficiently large @xmath4 , @xmath64 becomes entirely concave and continuous on @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath65 in other words , the addition of the term in @xmath4 to the thermodynamical potential changes the energy range where its nonconcavity is observed .",
    "this energy range is reduced as @xmath4 increases .",
    "equation ( [ gammap ] ) can be used to find the necessary condition on @xmath4 to obtain the microcanonical solution , @xmath66 here , @xmath67 is the specific heat , a negative quantity for energy ranges in figure 3 such that @xmath68 .",
    "figure 3 shows that , for the coupling @xmath63 , a finite value of @xmath4 is able to recover all stable microcanonical states .",
    "actually , @xmath62 is the minimum value necessary for this end . to obtain the corresponding stable microcanonical states for @xmath69 and @xmath51 in figure 1 ,",
    "one needs a rather small value for @xmath4 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that @xmath70 is sufficient for such couplings @xmath24 .",
    "the numerical solutions are presented in figure 4 .     and @xmath71 . the couplings @xmath24 are in the microcanonical first - order phase transition region.,width=288 ]     and @xmath71 .",
    "the couplings @xmath24 are in the microcanonical first - order phase transition region.,width=288 ]    for @xmath24 larger than @xmath72 , the microcanonical tricritical point , the recovery of all microcanonical states is achieved only for @xmath44 .",
    "different of a continuous recovery of microcanonical states , as shown in figures 3 and 4 , the caloric curves on this microcanonical first - order phase transition line sets a new physical situation . here",
    ", one observes jumps in the temperature , the analogous of the latent heat in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the energy where this transition occurs can be obtained by defining a vertical line corresponding to the maxwell construction for the microcanonical ensemble @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the microcanonical hysteresis effect is also present .",
    "this effect in the thermodynamics of a self - gravitating system has been discussed by chavanis @xcite .",
    "our figure 5 illustrates this situation for @xmath73 and @xmath71 .",
    "although for such values of @xmath24 the full recovery of _ all _ microcanonical states is only possible in the limit @xmath44 , we can still obtain valuable estimates about those states by choosing a very large numerical value for @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we were able to draw the continuation lines that define two branches , the high and low temperature branches , which produce the unstable and metastable lines of microcanonical states .",
    "the solutions depicted in figure 5 show that @xmath74 is a multivalued function of @xmath39 , signaling a microcanonical first - order phase transition , in addition to the standard profile of the canonical first - order phase transition when one draws horizontal lines corresponding to the maxwell s construction .",
    "the ege approach leads to analytical expressions for the extended free energy and entropy in a simple way , and quantifies the nonequivalence of ensembles .",
    "the nonconcavity of the microcanonical entropy function means that the system contains several energy - dependent stable states , revealed in the microcanonical ensemble , which have their counterpart in the canonical ensemble , but they are unstable or metastable in this latter ensemble . by microcanonical entropy",
    "we do not refer to the standard legendre transform of the canonical thermodynamical potential , which always produces a concave function of energy .",
    "the new term in @xmath4 added to the canonical free energy turns such unstable or metastable points into equilibrium points in the extended ensemble @xcite because it presents a concave `` extended '' entropy .",
    "moreover , it is explicitly shown for the bc model that not only the stable states present in the microcanonical approach can be obtained from ege but also the unstable and metastable ones .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5 , which shows the complexity of the microcanonical phase diagram and the usefulness of ege for such study .",
