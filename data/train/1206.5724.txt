    "cellular sensory systems can detect temporal and spatial changes of environmental signals .",
    "for example , bacteria sense chemical gradient by motion that translates spatial chemical concentration asymmetry into temporal asymmetry .",
    "larger chemotactic eukaryotes are able to sense the spatial gradients of chemoattractants across the cell dimension .",
    "a primary task for a sensory cell is to respond to small chemical concentration changes or shallow chemical gradients with sufficient accuracy under stochastic noises .",
    "berg and purcell , in their classic study  @xcite , showed that the fundamental physical limit of concentration sensing is set by the uncertainty of ligand diffusion to a sensory cell regardless of biochemical details in a sensing mechanism employed by the cell .",
    "this result was generalized by bialek and setayeshgar  @xcite using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , and was also applicable to gradient sensing  @xcite .",
    "ligand detection by membrane - bound chemoreceptors is the first step for chemical sensing in a vast majority of sensory systems of living cells .",
    "uncertainty of ligand - receptor binding and stochastic dynamics of downstream cellular signaling may introduce additional noises . reducing such noise may help a system to operate near the fundamental berg - purcell limit .",
    "however , the exact sensing limit under proper ligand - receptor interaction remains elusive .",
    "in particular , the effect of receptor cooperativity is controversial  @xcite .",
    "receptor cooperativity can sensitize the receptor response to small signal changes , but in the meanwhile it also amplifies stochastic fluctuations in signal . using the monod - wyman - changeux ( mwc ) model , bialek and setayeshgar  @xcite showed that receptor cooperativity helps to lower the threshold of concentration sensing to approach the berg - purcell limit set by ligand diffusion .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , by an ising - type model , showed that receptor cooperativity improves gradient sensing within a shortened dynamic range of background concentrations .",
    "most recently , skoge _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied chemoreceptor activity by a dynamic ising model and showed that receptor cooperativity could slow down receptor activity and thus may not improve the signal - to - noise ratio due to reduced response time .",
    "another crucial mechanism found in many cellular sensory systems is adaptation , which maintains the sensitivity of a system to varying levels of environmental signals .",
    "it is known that adaptation tunes kinetics of chemoreceptors at the molecular level .",
    "for the example of the better understood _ e. coli _ , the activity of receptors are modulated by multisite receptor methylation and demethylation . however , the effect of receptor cooperativity to chemical sensing limit under the context of receptor adaptation is yet to be examined .",

    "we derive formula for the limit of gradient sensing based on the uncertainty of instantaneous receptor states at the equilibrium .",
    "our results show that cooperativity by non - adaptative receptors reduces instantaneous noise of receptor states within a limited range of background concentrations determined by the biochemical parameters of receptor dynamics and ligand - receptor binding .",
    "in contrast , cooperativity by adaptative receptors improves the sensing accuracy across a wide dynamic range .",
    "we also show that the layout of receptor aggregates on the cell surface significantly affects the sensing limit with the isotropic layout being the optimal .",

    "the time interval between two independent measurements is determined by the correlation time @xmath188 that accounts for relaxation times of ligand diffusion , ligand - receptor binding  @xcite and receptor dynamics . because the amount of time @xmath189 available for averaging",

    "another possible source of noise at the ligand - receptor interaction level is due to ligand rebinding when a dissociated ligand diffuses back again to bind onto the receptor aggregate before it escapes into the bulk medium . the extent of ligand rebinding and its effects on the accuracy of ligand sensing depends on the size and density of a receptor aggregate  k_f / k_+)$ ] and @xmath194k_f / k_+)$ ] , where @xmath195 is the diffusion limited on rate to a receptor aggregate of size @xmath196 .",

    "our model of the receptor organization on the cell surface is general and can be parameterized to study systems of coupling or non - coupling receptors with or without adaptation .",
    "berg and purcell  @xcite showed that uniformly distributed receptor patches over the cell surface is optimal for reducing interactions between nearby receptors and therefore maximizes ligand intake by the cell , where ligands were considered spatially homogeneous in the environment . here , we consider the detection of spatial asymmetry of ligand concentrations around the cell due to the chemical gradient . by examining the effect of geometric layout of receptor aggregates on the cell surface , we showed that anisotropic receptor aggregate distribution generates a trade - off between the sensing limit of gradient steepness @xmath6 and that of the gradient direction @xmath7 ( fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) .",
