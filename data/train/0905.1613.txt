    "the  flavour mixing is a  common phenomenon in  the  quark sector as well as mixing by  means of  neutrino oscillations in  the  lepton sector . but",
    "in  the  standard model ( sm ) there is no such phenomenon in  connection with  charged leptons .",
    "it is a  built - in property based on  experimental results , without a  corresponding symmetry in  the  sm . with  massive neutrinos , charged lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) is possible , but  the  cross - section would be negligible due to  the  smallness of  the  neutrino mass and  the  gim cancellation mechanism .",
    "thus the  branching ratio ( br ) would not be detectable by  the  present experiments .",
    "however , beyond the  sm there are theoretical models allowing enhanced lfv in  the  charged leptons sector too .    due to  high lhc luminosity ( @xmath8 in low / high luminosity stage ) ,",
    "the  atlas and  cms experiments have excellent capabilities of  low - br decay measurements .",
    "one sector , in  which  lfv decays can be searched for , are the  purely leptonic @xmath0 decays . except for  an  initial particle - level based test of  the  feasibility of  the  measurement of  @xmath9 at  a  general purpose detector for  a collider experiment  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : bstaumu ] ) , there are no atlas / cms studies concerning direct lfv in  leptonic @xmath0 decays yet .",
    "however , the  phenomenon can also be studied indirectly using correlations between lfv and non - lfv decays . examples of  such correlations can be found e.g. in  constrained or  general flavour - universal mssm models  @xcite , relating the  br of  a  very rare @xmath10 decay to  the  lfv decays @xmath11 and  @xmath12 . both the  atlas and  the  cms experiments performed detailed studies of  a  possible measurement of  flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in  @xmath10 decays  @xcite . the  trigger and  the  analysis strategy , the  background sources , the  expected performance and  the  reach in  this channel are described in  section  [ sec : bsmumu ] .",
    "cms also studied @xmath12 lfv decays  @xcite .",
    "the  analysis details and  resulting performance are presented in  section  [ sec : taumumumu ] .",
    "the  di - muonic fcnc b - decays @xmath10 can occur in  the  sm through higher order diagrams only and  are also helicity suppressed , which results in  the  prediction of  a  very low br of  @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this small br provides room for  new physics ( np ) effects , which may enhance or  suppress br significantly .",
    "present best limits are set by  tevatron : a  cdf measurement at  @xmath14 sets the  upper limit on  the  br to  @xmath15 at @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the  projected improvement of  the  tevatron results  @xcite does not  foresee reaching the  sm br . in",
    "constrast the  lhc experiments will even be  able to  measure a  suppressed br w.r.t to  the  sm prediction , especially after entering the  high luminosity stage of  lhc .",
    "both the  atlas and  cms triggers for  @xmath10  @xcite are at  the  first level ( l1 ) based on  a  detection of  two high-@xmath17 muons and  at  the  high level trigger ( hlt ) the  @xmath0 vertex is fitted and  cuts on  its quality , eventually position and  di - muon invariant mass are applied .",
    "presently , the  atlas @xmath10 study requires two @xmath18 muons at  l1 , while the  cms study lets to  pass through muons with  @xmath19 . however , based on  the  first data , the  cuts are subject to  change with  the  luminosity in  order to  keep an  acceptable  trigger - output rate . at  the  luminosity of  @xmath20 the  atlas l1 rate",
    "is expected to  be @xmath21 and  the  cms l1 rate @xmath22 .",
    "the  detectors have similar pseudorapidity coverage @xmath23 .    at  the  atlas hlt ,",
    "firstly the  muons detection is confirmed by  information from  precision chambers and  calorimeters .",
    "tracks reconstruction is then performed in  a region around the  two l1 muon directions and  di - muon candidates are defined . applying a  vertex fit procedure a  quality cut @xmath24 and  a loose invariant mass cut @xmath25",
    "are currently required .",
    "however , these  cuts could be tightened or  new cuts could be introduced ( e.g. a  cut on  @xmath0 transverse decay length @xmath26 ) when a  too high output rate is experienced with  first lhc data .",
    "the  overall l1 and  hlt efficiency of  46% was found on  a sample of  simulated signal events with  muons @xmath27 and  @xmath28 . at  a  very low starting luminosity of  @xmath29 the  l1 threshold cut on  the  muons @xmath17",
    "can be lowered down to  @xmath30 and  the  track reconstruction could be performed in  the  full volume of  the  atlas inner detector .",
    "the  cms hlt firstly verifies l1 muons , then the  primary vertex is searched ( only the  3 most - significant vertices are considered ) and  tracks of  @xmath31 are reconstructed in  cones around the  muon directions .",
    "the  tracks are always formed from  less than six detector hits in  order to  speed up the  reconstruction process , but at  the  expense of  a  certain performance degradation ( @xmath32 @xmath0 mass resolution to be compared to  @xmath33 in  the  offline analysis ) .",
    "after vertex fitting , a  decay length cut of  @xmath34 , a  vertex quality cut of  @xmath35 and  a  @xmath0 invariant mass window of  @xmath36 width are applied .",
    "the  output rate after the  hlt is expected to be below @xmath37 .      due to  the  clear experimental signature",
    ", the  selection criteria are limited to  the  following cuts on : the  @xmath0 invariant mass window , the  secondary vertex displacement and the  vertex - fit quality , the  @xmath0 momentum pointing to  the  primary vertex , the  isolation of  the  muon pair and the di - muon opening angle .",
    "the  detector - driven mass resolution should either be sufficient to  distinguish @xmath0 from  @xmath38 , or a  joint analysis of  both decay channels has to  be performed . the  vertex position and  fit - quality cuts reduce combinatorial background originating from  the  primary vertex .",
    "the  @xmath0-pointing - to - the - primary - vertex requirement suppresses events with  particles invisible to  the  detector and  originating at  the  di - muon vertex .",
    "finally , the  isolation constraint helps to  similarly suppress visible particles originating from  the  di - muon vertex .      in  the  atlas offline analysis high-@xmath17",
    "muon tracks are combined to  di - muon pairs and  the  appropriate vertex is fitted .",
    "a  preselection of  the  @xmath0 candidates is performed by  requiring @xmath39 for  the  di - muon pair invariant mass , vertex fit quality @xmath24 and  a  transverse decay length @xmath40 .",
    "a  final asymmetric invariant mass cut of  @xmath41 is used in  order to  separate @xmath0 candidates from  @xmath38 background .",
    "the  di - muonic invariant mass resolution at  atlas is @xmath42 for  the  barrel region ( @xmath43 ) and  @xmath44 for  the  end - cap . a  combined value @xmath45 is estimated as the  invariant mass resolution for  the  signal events .",
    "secondary vertex separation is defined by  requiring a  @xmath0 decay length @xmath46 . in  order to  assure the  @xmath0 pointing to  the  primary vertex , the  @xmath0 momentum and  the  position vector from  the  primary to  the  secondary vertex have to  be parallel within an  angle of  @xmath47 .",
    "the  di - muon pair isolation is defined using @xmath48 condition , where the  sum runs over all tracks of  @xmath49 ( excluding signal muons ) reconstructed within a  cone  of  @xmath50 around the  di - muon momentum .",
    "the  cms offline analysis is similar to  the  atlas one . due to  a  better @xmath0 invariant mass resolution of  @xmath33",
    ", a symmetric mass window of  @xmath51 is used .",
    "a  decay length significance @xmath52 and  vertex - fit @xmath53 cuts are applied . the  @xmath0 momentum and  the  vector from  the  primary to  the  secondary vertex",
    "are required to be aligned with  each other better than @xmath54 .",
    "the  muon pair isolation criterion uses a  @xmath55 cut , with  the  @xmath56 defined similarly as  in  atlas analysis , only applying lower @xmath17 cut of  @xmath57 on  the  tracks considered in  the  cone around the  di - muon momentum .",
    "lastly , the  opening angle @xmath58 between the  two muon tracks is required to satisfy @xmath59 .",
    "the  background comes from  random combinatorics of  high-@xmath17 muons , especially in  events with  @xmath60 pairs , where the  eventual di - muon vertex position is naturally displaced from  the  primary vertex by  a  distance typical for  @xmath61-hadrons .",
    "the  two muon candidates can  come from  semileptonic decays of  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 quarks or  from a  cascade decay of  either the  @xmath62 or  @xmath63 quark .",
    "the  extremely low br of  the  signal decay channel allows that also rare processes ( often not included in standard mc generators ) can significantly contribute to  the  background , as do misidentified hadron - tracks .",
    "these background contributions can be evaluated by  a mc study of  dedicated exclusive background channels .",
    "however , the  inclusive @xmath64 background event generation and  the  corresponding full detector simulation are limited by  the  available cpu resources .",
    "thus , events need to be filtered already at  the  generator level and  a  factorization of  the  analysis cuts and  a  study of  correlations between that cuts need to be performed .",
    "the  limited resources still lead to  a  very limited precision of  the  estimated number of  background events , and as such are awaiting improvement by  the  first lhc data . the  atlas and  cms expectation of  the  inclusive background at  an  integrated luminosity of  @xmath65 yields @xmath66 and  @xmath67 events respectively .",
    "the  background caused by  rare decays or  misidentification of  muons can be divided into  four groups depending on  the  mechanism mimicking the  signal events .",
    "given that the  false @xmath0 signals come from @xmath61-hadron decays with  two oppositely charged high-@xmath17 tracks ( real muons or  misidentified hadrons ) and  remaining soft particles in  the  final state ( not seen ) , the  resulting di - muon invariant mass could be close to  the  @xmath61-hadron mass .",
    "therefore the  mass resolution is a  crucial factor when  rejecting these backgrounds .",
    "the  signal and  selected backgrounds invariant mass distributions corresponding to  a  measurement at  atlas after one  year of  low luminosity running is shown at  figure  [ fig : backgroundmisid ] .    * the  first class of  background is formed by  rare @xmath61-decays that contain three muons coming from  the  same ( or  a  negligibly close ) vertex .",
    "a  fake @xmath61-signal can appear when one of  the  muons and  the  remaining neutrino are soft and  thus not  being considered in  the  signal decay reconstruction .",
    "representatives of  this background class are : + + [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ tab : bstaumudetresol ]     and  non - resonant background  @xcite .",
    "both histograms are normalized to  unity.,width=272,height=185 ]",
    "a  set of  atlas and  cms analyses relating lepton flavour violation phenomena to  purely leptonic @xmath0 decays were summarized .",
    "presently , there is only a  particle based feasibility study of  a  direct lfv measurement on  @xmath1 decays , but the  phenomena can also be constrained by  measuring the  br of  the  very rare decay @xmath2 . in  some models  @xcite the  br of  @xmath68 is correlated with  the  brs of  the  lfv decays @xmath1 and  @xmath3 .",
    "the  @xmath2 studies of  the  decay show that the  br measurement will improve limits from  tevatron measurement already after the first year of  lhc running at  low - luminosity .",
    "the  @xmath4 measurement of  standard model br is expected by  the  end of  the  low luminosity stage and  @xmath69 observation should be made shortly after the  first year of  running at  high luminosity .",
    "a  detailed analysis of  possibly strong background contributions from  other rare decays and particle mis - identification effects was performed , predicting negligible contribution .",
    "thus the  decays @xmath70 remain the  main source of  background .",
    "the  @xmath71 upper limits on  the  br(@xmath3 ) measured at  cms will reach present belle bounds by  the  end of  lhc s low luminosity stage .",
    "the  analysis of  the  @xmath72 lepton sources predict that the  @xmath72 leptons from  @xmath73 and  @xmath74 boson decays will dominate the  measurements , because the  lower cross - section w.r.t .",
    "to  @xmath61- and  @xmath75-meson induced @xmath72 decays , is compensated by  a  higher trigger acceptance .",
    "an  initial study of  the  topological reconstruction of  decays with missing particles applied to  the  @xmath6 channel demonstrated the  feasibility of  such measurements at  atlas and  cms , but a  proper trigger study , full detector simulation and  a  background analysis still needs to  be performed .",
