    "understanding the nature of the milky way halo ",
    "its shape , extent , density distribution , kinematics , abundance distribution and origin  has long been a central topic in astronomy .",
    "the importance of this endeavor has increased substantially with the growing , pervasive connections to a number of other astronomical enterprises bearing on such wide ranging astrophysical problems as , for example , the magnitude and distribution of dark matter and the frequency of microlensing events , the origin of the second parameter problem of horizontal branch morphology in globular clusters , the nature of high velocity hi clouds , the interaction of galaxies with their environment , and , of course , the origin and evolution of the milky way . in spite of the pressing need for a detailed picture of the halo , at present we still have only the most rudimentary prescriptions of , for example , the phase space distribution of halo stars .",
    "unfortunately , for many applications we no longer can be satisfied with elementary analytical models of the halo . indeed , the very suitability of such simple descriptions may now be questioned .",
    "a number of new lines of evidence indicate that the halo of the milky way has not achieved a dynamically relaxed state .",
    "confirmation of this rather old idea is a long time in coming .",
    "studies of candidate `` moving groups '' of metal - poor stars with halo kinematics in the solar neighborhood were made long ago by eggen and collaborators @xcite , and the idea of a halo with significant structure in the form of intermingling `` tube - like swarms '' was a viable theoretical description at least 35 years ago @xcite .",
    "however , apart from consistent attention to the subject of halo `` moving groups '' by @xcite ( @xcite , and references therein ) , until recently the subject of halo substructure has received little other interest , in deference to more prosaic descriptions of the galactic halo  those easily described by relatively simple analytical prescriptions .",
    "this state of affairs was influenced perhaps , in part , by a growing emphasis on computer models of galactic structure that relied on analytical density laws ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* _ et seq . _ ) , coupled with the lack of _ systematic _ observational efforts toward uncovering even first order global laws ( e.g. , density relations , amount of flattening , kinematical and chemical trends with position ) along more than a small number of lines of sight , let alone _ deviations _ from these simple global descriptions .",
    "moreover , the rather smoother phase space distributions of the `` flattened halo '' and intermediate population ii ( which may or may not be parts of one continuous population ; see @xcite ) , locally dominate the more extended halo component  what @xcite refers to as the `` pure races of the halo population ii '' .",
    "indeed , that these flattened galactic populations contain stars with chemodynamical properties ( `` high velocity '' and low metallicity ) that are typically considered `` halo - like '' has long vexed understanding of the true `` mixture ratios '' and individual chemodynamical properties of the various overlapping stellar populations ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "the more relaxed dynamical state of the locally more dominant , flattened metal - poor components of the galaxy may have long distracted attention from an unrelaxed halo population filled with _",
    "substructure_.    with the latter point as preface , it is worthwhile , therefore , to clarify our own working conception of the `` halo ''  that galactic component we aim to explore in the present survey  since the very definition of `` halo '' has taken on such a diversity of connotations .",
    "presently fashionable `` dual halo '' models of the milky way  those containing both flattened , prograde rotating and spherical , slow to non- ( or even retrograde ) rotating metal - poor components @xcite  bear a resemblance to the commonly accepted galactic descriptions at the 1957 vatican conference @xcite , when one appreciates that the properties of the intermediate population ii ( ipii ) discussed there parallel properties assigned to the `` new '' flattened , contracted halo / thick disk components in today s models . in the present survey , we are concerned with oort s `` pure race '' of population ii : the extended , more or less spherical distribution of stars with the most extreme kinematics in the galaxy , where growing theoretical and observational work suggests evidence of past galactic accretion events may be fossilized .",
    "the intermediate population ii , `` low '' or `` flattened '' halo  which may all be the same thing @xcite  we address more fully in our parallel astrometric survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* _ et seq . _ ) .    in the last decade or so , a number of developments have spawned intense interest in the interaction of milky way - like galaxies with each other and with their satellites and clusters : e.g. , ( 1 ) the popularity of cold dark matter models of the universe , with the concomitant `` bottom up '' growth of structure from the collection of smaller subunits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( 2 ) the realization of the prevalence of gravitationally interacting galactic systems in the nearby universe ( demonstrated of course by @xcite ; and explored more recently by , for example , @xcite ) and at high redshifts by @xcite , ( 3 ) the discovery of the formation of globular clusters @xcite and dwarf satellites @xcite in the course of such gravitational interactions , ( 4 ) the discovery of new galactic satellites @xcite , possibly associated galactic neighbors @xcite , and distant globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the fact that some of these systems have complex star formation histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 5 ) the recognition of the complexities of the dynamics of the local group and the implications for the size of galactic dark matter components and the cosmological density , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "new computer studies of galaxy interactions ( @xcite , but all predated by @xcite ) confirm long - held notions ( @xcite ; see also the related results of @xcite ) that satellite galaxies , when experiencing tidal disruption by a larger galactic potential , can leave behind long - lived structures ",
    "oort s `` tube - like swarms ''  along the satellite orbit .",
    "the idea that these _ satellites themselves _ may not be dynamically relaxed systems @xcite has also played an important role in the debate on the existence of substantial dark matter halos in these systems ( cf .",
    "discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "hints of substructure in the galactic halo that may be the `` swarms '' that are the hallmark of accretion of smaller stellar systems have been suggested in several surveys of halo stars undertaken since the concentrated effort of eggen to find halo ( and other ) `` moving groups '' among stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this more recent evidence has most often been found in surveys of the more distant , `` pure '' halo , and most typically as clusterings of stars in distance and radial velocity",
    " e.g. , the clumps of distant blue horizontal branch stars in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "one very notable radial velocity - distance clump in the survey of distant stars by @xcite is now recognized as the structural paradigm of the type of tidal events sought here  an extremely elongated , tidal structure forming through the destruction of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .",
    "indeed , the sgr galaxy was first identified through the clustering of radial velocities in distant _ giant stars _ , a technique we intend to exploit in the present survey .    earlier evidence for possible tidal debris recognized as families of associated outer halo clusters and dwarf spheroidals was discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and has received an increase in interest more recently @xcite .",
    "one `` family '' of clusters ( including arp 2 , terzan 7 and 8 , m54 , and pal 12 ) is apparently associated with the paradigm tidal event , sagittarius @xcite .",
    "phase space clumpings of more nearby , dwarf stars have also been identified by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) , and @xcite , with the clumps in the latter three works  delineated in all three dimensions of motion  very clearly being identified as halo members on the basis of both kinematics and abundance .",
    "a surprising implication of @xcite is that the more distant halo appears to be _ dominated _ by phase space structure  i.e. , very little `` random '' , dynamically relaxed halo field population exists outside of the ipii .",
    "this empirical result would appear to echo theoretical suggestions that a large fraction of the halo might contain substructure @xcite .",
    "detailed surveys of the halo including both precision proper motions and radial velocities , like the @xcite analysis , may be needed to understand the full spectrum of structure in halo phase space , and that particular survey continues to pursue that question .",
    "however , to cover any significant amount of area in this detailed manner presents a formidable and improbable task at present .",
    "moreover , to carry out this kind of work to distances as large as those of the present retinue of galactic satellites  possibly major contributors to the overall halo field star population  will need to await new generations of microarcsecond astrometry instruments , such as the space interferometry mission . in the meantime , questions regarding the existence of halo substructure , its extent , filling factor , size spectrum , etc . may be approached even when full kinematical data may not be obtainable .",
    "the survey we describe here is aimed at divining and defining physical substructure in the halo when that substructure is coherent and has reasonable contrast above any well - mixed background in the occupied volume .",
    "a primary aim of the present survey is to probe to large galactic distances with ease , and so provide a complement to the more detailed , but more confined , @xcite proper motion - radial velocity survey of the halo and ipii .",
    "the greater distances probed in the giant survey described here lend certain advantages over a survey of more nearby stars , even one replete with full , 3-d kinematical information .",
    "while perhaps decreasing sensitivity to subtle , more diffuse , structures requiring a full analysis of phase space , exploring at great distances from the galactic midplane unfetters the data and analysis from contamination by stars in the same survey volume having similar chemodynamical properties to , but coming from stellar populations ( e.g. , ipii , or the `` lower halo '' ) other than , the `` pure '' halo . from the standpoint of uncovering detailed information on the history of the galaxy from phase space substructure , surveys of distant halo stars",
    "also have the added benefit that remote tidal structures are longer lived in the softer gradient of the galactic potential at large radii .",
    "debris closer to the galactic center becomes phase - mixed rather quickly , and loses spatial coherence that would otherwise be easily identifiable ( although _ velocity _ coherence is _ increased _ ",
    "distance also increases the contrast of strongly coherent structures against the background , because the linear width of a given structure subtends a smaller area on the sky , and the magnitude spread in the color - magnitude diagram from depth effects is decreased ( see @xcite ) , and because any smooth background of stars should have a rather steep density fall - off with galactocentric radius ( going as , say , @xmath10 ) .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite makes it evident that kinematic substructure in the halo would be difficult to see with simple starcounting techniques .",
    "the densities of `` star swarms '' from dissociated galactic satellites are simply too low to be detectable above the foreground curtain of disk and ipii dwarfs  a problem especially confounded when the swarms are at distances where the _ much smaller _ volume density of their luminous , evolved stars is the only signal likely to be observable . to make tidal streams in the outer halo more evident , it clearly would be beneficial to be able to reduce , or completely filter out , foreground disk contamination , to which main sequence stars make the greatest contribution redward of the field main sequence turnoff .",
    "the signal - to - noise of a systematic search could be increased substantially if one were able _ a priori _ to key on stars of a set absolute luminosity because then disk and ipii stars with this luminosity would be easily differentiated from outer halo stars simply by their substantially brighter apparent magnitudes .",
    "for example , halo rr lyrae stars and horizontal branch stars , which have a relatively limited range of absolute magnitudes , are rather easy to identify on the basis of variability or color and have been used as tracers of halo structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , horizontal branch stars are sufficiently rare that , while they can point to the _ presence _ of halo substructure , they may not be able to trace subtle or more _ tenuous _ halo substructure convincingly and/or thoroughly , as the rather small , candidate `` moving groups '' found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite would suggest .",
    "unevolved , main sequence stars would , of course , make up the bulk of any stellar stream , but it is too difficult at present to explore dwarf stars to very great distances over large areas , though this technique has been used to study deep , pencil beam surveys with large telescopes in small numbers of strategically placed directions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for exploring halo substructure",
    ", giant stars may provide a reasonable compromise between the problems associated with the readily identifiable , but less numerous horizontal branch stars and the more common , but intrinsically faint dwarf stars .",
    "giant stars are generally a few times more populous than horizontal branch stars in a given stellar population and provide the distinct advantage that they are bright enough to be imaged to great distances even with small telescopes . with giant stars large volumes of the outer galaxy may be explored efficiently with small telescopes ( where larger blocks of observing time are easier to come by ) if a reasonable means can be found by which to pick out the giants from the foreground dwarfs .",
    "there have been several k giant studies at high galactic latitude @xcite from which we can infer expected densities of population ii giants .",
    "@xcite found @xmath11 1 giant deg@xmath12 in a survey complete for the magnitude range @xmath13 covering @xmath14 deg@xmath15 at the sgp . in several high galactic latitude fields covering a total area of @xmath16 deg@xmath15",
    ", @xcite found a mean density for population ii giants of order 2 deg@xmath12 in the magnitude range @xmath17 . with an expected mean radial fall - off of the halo with galactocentric radius as @xmath18",
    "we obtain a flat differential count of giants with magnitude ( ) and we may extrapolate that to @xmath19 ( distances of @xmath20  kpc , for typical @xmath21 halo metallicity giants ) we should expect approximate mean densities of halo giants of @xmath22  deg@xmath12 .",
    "thus , it is clear that a survey for giant stars must cover large areas of the sky in order to garner reasonably large statistical samples .",
    "the requirement for large sky coverage drives the criteria to make our survey as efficient as possible at identifying giant stars .",
    "it has long been known that the strength of the mgh + mgb triplet feature at 5100   is strongly dependent on surface gravity ( see figure 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is a common technique to identify giants by their weak absorption in this part of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) showed that discrimination of k giants and dwarfs by this feature was possible with low resolution ( 20   ) objective prism plates from schmidt telescopes , while @xcite and @xcite had already devised a technique by which to identify giants _ photometrically _ with a pair of intermediate band filters , centered at 4880   ( @xmath23  `` continuum '' ) and 5150   ( @xmath0  `` mg '' ) .",
    "this filter system has been applied to the giant surveys of @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite ( @xcite , _ et seq . _ ) showed that good photometric luminosity classification was still possible with the @xmath0 filter ( see figure 1 ) when the continuum was measured with an appropriate broad band filter , in this case the @xmath6 filter of the washington system @xcite , at considerable savings in telescope time .",
    "note that @xcite actually proposed the use of just such an intermediate band filter located around 5000   to allow luminosity classification .",
    "the washington system itself was designed as a more efficient broadband system than @xmath24 for the study of the temperatures and abundances of g and k giants ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "geisler s work has demonstrated the efficacy of separating g - k dwarfs and giants in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath4 ) color - color diagram ( where @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath25 are in the washington system ) for a sample of stars spanning a broad range of metallicity .",
    "geisler pointed out additional features of his technique that are beneficial to a survey as described here : ( 1 ) the @xmath4 index is insensitive to surface gravity variations among g giants , ( 2 ) the reddening vector in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath4 ) diagram is such that more reddened , more distant giants will be even _ more _ separated from less - reddened foreground dwarfs ( see figure 4 ) , and ( 3 ) the metallicity sensitivity of the @xmath4 index is a second order effect , and in the sense that metal - poor giants have even _ smaller _ mg absorption .",
    "the latter feature makes geisler s system even more useful , since there is additional discriminating power for our typically expected situation of selecting metal - poor population ii giants from among foreground metal - rich dwarfs .",
    "* pb94 hereafter ) demonstrated the gravity discrimination of geisler s system using a grid of synthetic spectra over a range of surface temperatures , gravities and abundances appropriate to both population i and ii stars , and including realistic sequences of atmospheres for red giant branch isochrones .",
    "their work provides a useful demonstration of the effects of gravity and abundance on the ( @xmath4 ) index : gravity dominates the color but there is a secondary sensitivity to abundance .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 where the @xcite synthetic colors are translated to loci in washington / ddo51 color - color planes for dwarfs and giants of different [ fe / h ] .",
    "we note here one possible shortcoming of the @xcite curves : as noted by @xcite , @xcite used filter passbands which differ slightly from the adopted standard washington filters , and furthermore , they have used an unpublished grid of model spectra , which are now somewhat out of date .",
    "this probably gives rise to the blueward translation and small rotation in the color - color plane that we find necessary in  3.6 ( figure 12b and table 2 ) .",
    "@xcite themselves point out that their isochrones are systematically redder than observed globular cluster giant branches .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite did not include the @xmath0 filter when they produced their own ( more accurate ) synthetic colors .",
    "this leaves @xcite as the only source for synthetic photometry with which we can compare our own photometry .",
    "we emphasize that any problems with the @xcite colors appear to be quite small ( again , see  3.6 ) , in as much as they relate to our data .",
    "two important and relevant effects fall out of this interplay of gravity and abundance as illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the first is that weakened absorption lines in metal - poor dwarfs that mimic the suppression of mg absorption from low gravity in giants becomes a problem only for subdwarfs with [ fe / h]@xmath26 .",
    "main sequence stars more metal - rich than this , presumably all of those in the disk components and the majority in the halo as well , are not , in general , confused with giants , even giants as metal - rich as the sun .",
    "the second relevant effect is that , for stars on the giant branch , the ( @xmath4 ) color provides a reasonably good abundance indicator [ @xmath27})\\sim 0.13 $ ] at ( @xmath28 ) ] from solar [ fe / h ] down to [ fe / h]@xmath29",
    ".    both of these effects are critical to our enterprise here .",
    "first , the metallicity sensitivity of ( @xmath4 ) we expect to be useful for an initial sorting of faint giant stars we encounter .",
    "for example , the appearance of an apparent excess of giant stars of a single ( @xmath4)-based abundance would be an expected signal for a tidal tail from a mono - metallic parent object ( a commonly expected paradigm ) .",
    "such an excess is clearly seen , for example , in our study of extratidal stars near the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy in ( see , e.g. , figures 79 in that paper ) .    in the case of very metal - poor subdwarfs",
    ", we should not encounter an overwhelming number of contaminants in a sample of giants selected by ( @xmath4 ) techniques , based on the very small fraction of galactic stars with metallicities this poor . from the interim model of @xcite ,",
    "the number of halo intermediate population ii / thick disk stars expected in the @xmath30 color range down to @xmath31 is about 200 deg@xmath12 at a galactic pole .",
    "approximately half of these stars would be dwarfs and only about 8% of _ these _ would be expected to have metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath32 , according to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this leaves an expected level of contamination of @xmath33 metal - poor subdwarfs deg@xmath12 , comparable to an expected density of giants of @xmath34 deg@xmath12 down to @xmath31 .",
    "this is , of course , in the ideal situation of high galactic latitude . on the other hand , because of the rapid decline in the metallicity distribution function below [ fe / h]@xmath29 , it is possible , with only slightly more conservative giant selection in the color - color plane , to reduce the subdwarf contamination to practically nothing .",
    "for example , if one were interested in selecting for [ fe / h]@xmath35 giants , one would only be concerned with about two [ fe / h]@xmath36 subdwarfs per square degree ( see figure 2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we believe this level of contamination in our initial photometric catalogues to be tolerable . in any case",
    ", when such stars are encountered , they will be identifiable by followup spectra ( or , for the brighter stars , by their proper motion from such catalogues as the nltt ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ et seq . _ ) ) .",
    "moreover , these metal - poor stars are interesting in their own right , and worthy of discovery for further exploration of the galaxy s evolution .    for our survey , we have adopted a variant of the geisler technique that balances the goals of covering large areas as efficiently as possible with the desire to obtain as much information about identified giant stars as possible .",
    "we have adopted a _ three filter _ photometric system that provides dwarf / giant separation capability , a surface temperature indicator , and a rough gauge of stellar abundance in giant stars . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 color serves as a surface temperature index , while the @xmath4 is used as the luminosity index .",
    "however , as we shall show (  2.1 ) , the @xmath2 color is monotonically correlated to the @xmath1 color .",
    "thus , @xmath2 can serve as a suitable temperature index ( as has also been demonstrated by @xcite ) , with the advantage that one less filter is needed in the observations with no loss in information  a useful improvement in efficiency . in this paper",
    ", we explore and calibrate the ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 ) diagram for discriminating dwarf and giant stars for a range of metallicities (  2 ) .",
    "we note that the washington @xmath37 filter is designed specifically for photometric abundance measurement in giant stars , and use of this filter would provide a much more accurate [ fe / h ] for our survey giants ( particularly metal - poor ones ) than relying on the secondary dependence of ( @xmath4 ) on abundance .",
    "however , observations in the @xmath37 filter are rather expensive ( requiring 3 times the exposure time of the @xmath6 filter to reach an equivalent depth ",
    "since we already require a large investment in observing time for the @xmath0 filter , and our primary imaging goal is to identify giants with as great efficiency as possible , we have dispensed with using the @xmath37 filter in most of what we do .",
    "our rationale is two - fold : ( 1 ) we believe that the coarse abundances afforded by the ( @xmath4 ) color are sufficient for tidal tail / halo substructure searches in our photometry , and ( 2 ) it is our intention to back up our photometrically identified giant candidates with spectroscopy as much as possible .",
    "spectroscopy is needed not only as a check on our giant candidates , but also as a means to obtain dynamical information from their radial velocities .",
    "much better abundances may be obtained from moderate resolution spectra ( sufficient for a radial velocity measure ) than from @xmath37 filter photometry .",
    "typical spectra of the type we are using for this followup work are shown in figure 1 , where several spectroscopic indicators of surface gravity , including the mgb , mgh , and nad features , may be seen .",
    "we will discuss our spectroscopic work for this survey further in future contributions .",
    "the selection of fields for our survey reflects two distinct , but complementary , strategies .",
    "the first is predicated on the paradigm afforded by the example of the sgr dwarf galaxy as well as by dynamical models of tidal effects on satellite galaxies , both which suggest that a non - negligible mass loss rate in the form of stripped stars may be discernible around presently known satellite galaxies .",
    "thus , it makes sense to start a search for tidal tails in the galactic halo at the most obvious potential sites for their creation .",
    "we have therefore begun a systematic search for giant stars beyond the tidal radii of the galactic dwarf satellite galaxies , as well as a sample of globular clusters .",
    "we have already reported successful searches for extended , coherent stellar structures around our first two targets , the magellanic clouds @xcite and the carina dwarf spheroidal ( ) .",
    "as the example of the sgr galaxy illustrates , the tidal debris of satellite galaxies may stretch to substantial lengths ( @xcite ) , and perhaps completely encircle the sky @xcite .",
    "tracing substantially lengthy tails continuously outward from the parent could be an extremely time - consuming enterprise , and should be weighed against the potential for tracking the path of the debris with more disparate , strategically placed , pencil beam probes around the sky .",
    "another problem that may be addressed with a series of probes is the existence of debris from objects that no longer exist with any recognizable , gravitationally intact core . in terms of the formation history of the milky way halo ,",
    "it is obviously of great interest to assess the net contribution of disrupted bodies to the halo .",
    "finally , in order to understand the distribution of any `` smooth background '' of halo stars  the magnitude of which affects the contrast of any superimposed substructure @xcite  it makes sense to perform a more systematic survey that can address the global distribution of giant stars .    for all of these reasons , and",
    "others , we have also embarked on the grid giant star survey ( ggss ) .",
    "the ggss is a program to observe 1303 isotropically spaced ( mean field spacing @xmath38 ) galaxy pencil - beam probes , each of area 0.40.7 deg@xmath15 , to find giant and hb stars to explore galaxy structure .",
    "the details and results of this systematic survey will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the `` all - galaxy '' ggss has similar goals and strategy to the `` spaghetti survey '' described by @xcite .",
    "this survey also adopts a ( @xmath39 ) photometric search phase to identify giants and hb stars for spectroscopic followup , and has presented initial findings and discussion of strategy in @xcite .",
    "together , the spaghetti and ggss surveys should provide a wealth of new information on the outer galaxy .    in  2 we determine transformations from our ( @xmath6 , @xmath25 ) system to both the ( @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath7 , @xmath40 ) systems . in ",
    "3 we calibrate the ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 ) color - color diagram for discriminating dwarfs and giants , and explore the metallicity trends for giant stars in this diagram .",
    "we obtain good agreement in our empirical calibration of this two - color plane with that given by synthetic spectra .",
    "finally , by way of @xmath5 centauri giants as templates , we determine a rough calibration of giant star absolute magnitudes as a function of photometric abundance ( i.e. , position in the two - color diagram ) , which can be used for photometric parallaxes .",
    "the washington system was originally designed to obtain temperatures , metal abundances and cn indices ( which relate well to [ fe / h ] for population i stars , @xcite , but vary independently of abundance for [ fe / h]@xmath41 , @xcite ) for g and k giants _ photometrically _ @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of the photometric part of our survey is simpler  to _ identify _ potential giant stars .",
    "thus , whenever possible , candidate giants will be subjected to spectroscopic follow - up to verify surface gravity ( weeding out k subdwarfs ) , obtain a radial velocity and determine a _ spectroscopic _ metallicity ) color . ] .",
    "thus , we can hope to reduce the number of washington filter measurements to the minimum necessary to achieve our survey goals .",
    "for example , at present we are not emphasizing measurement of carbon abundances , so the cn and g band - sensitive @xmath37 filter is not essential to our aims . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath6 filter is needed to serve as a `` continuum '' complement to the @xmath0 filter , a la @xcite , and must be retained .",
    "because the sensitivity of the @xmath4 index to surface gravity is a function of surface temperature , and because the derivation of spectroscopic abundances and gravities requires some measure of the effective temperature , we need an additional photometric measure sensitive to @xmath42 . in the standard washington system",
    ", the @xmath1 parameter serves the role of a temperature index , but for our purposes greater efficiency could be obtained if a single additional filter could be combined with the already required @xmath6 filter to provide a suitable temperature index .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath6 filter is subjected to more line blanketing in metal - rich stellar atmospheres than the @xmath3 filter .",
    "indeed , in the washington system @xcite , the combination of @xmath43 with @xmath1 is intended to provide a metallicity index , @xmath44 ( measured from the solar abundance locus  similar to the definition of @xmath45 ) . however , according to figure 10 of @xcite , the range of @xmath44 , is at most about 0.15 magnitudes over @xmath46 [ fe / h ] @xmath47 for giants with a wide range of @xmath1 ; and for giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath48  typical of the expected metallicities of distant giants we might hope to find in our survey  the range of @xmath44 is only about 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 color may provide an adequate temperature index for our purposes .",
    "indeed , @xcite conclude that `` @xmath2 is better than @xmath1 for temperature determinations , although it is slightly sensitive to surface gravity . ''    in figure 3",
    "we justify our exclusion of @xmath3 imaging in the present survey as a means to reduce our photometric survey to the simple @xmath49 filter system .",

    "we conclude that while @xmath1 has been proven an excellent @xmath42 index for g and k stars @xcite , the @xmath2 color also provides an adequate color index suitably correlated to @xmath42 and with only slight sensitivity to abundances . that we can retain excellent dwarf - giant discrimination in the _ three filter _",
    "@xmath51 system is illustrated by the synthetic photometry of @xcite in figure 2b . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we provide an _ empirical _ formulation for this methodology .",
    "it is useful to determine the transformation of our washington ( @xmath6 , @xmath25 ) filter system into the more commonly used cousins ( @xmath7 , @xmath40 ) system . in this way",
    "we may compare our field star and cluster color - magnitude data to the extensive work done in the cousins system in the literature .    to determine the transformation functions we take advantage of the tabulation of photometry by @xcite , who have measured @xmath7 magnitudes along with washington photometry in the establishment of their standard star system .",
    "we also make the assumption that the @xmath25 filter is identical to the cousins @xmath52 filter .",
    "this assumption is justified by the great similarity of the @xmath25 bandpass described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see his figure 1 ) and that of the cousins @xmath52 band as illustrated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see his figure 1 ) .",
    "indeed , both bands are often produced by the same combination of schott rg-9 filter with dry - ice cooled ga - as photomultiplier @xcite , and similar effective filter central wavelengths , @xmath53  , are determined for giant star colors for the @xmath25 and @xmath52 filters by these two authors . however , as discussed by bessell , the standard stars of @xcite were established with a photomultiplier kept @xmath54c warmer , which gives rise to a 130   redward shift in the @xmath55 in the cousins standards .",
    "we ignore here any possible affect this might have on any @xmath25 to @xmath52 transformation .",
    "presumably , the @xmath25 magnitudes of @xcite would be identical to the `` natural gaas '' system @xmath52 band of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see his section iii ) , from which @xcite notes a slight non - unity ( a slope of 1.036 ) in conversion to the standard @xcite system in @xmath56 color , all attributed to the @xmath40 band shift with photomultiplier temperature .",
    "thus , we might expect a systematic error in the slope of the ( @xmath2 ) to @xmath57 color conversion derived below of up to 3.6% .",
    "also to be kept in mind are any possible extensions of the redward side of the @xmath52 or @xmath25 response function for any combination of , say , the rg-9 glass ( a `` cut - on '' filter ) and ccd detectors that may have significant response up to the substrate bandgap cutoff in the near - infrared ; this problem would affect the reddest stars .",
    "for the 79 stars in @xcite that span @xmath58 , we obtain a good linear color transformation ( rms residual = 0.014 ) as follows :    @xmath59    a significant contribution to the rms residual about this fit was contributed by the two reddest stars , each having @xmath60 , in the sample",
    ". a cubic fit to the data yields no significant improvement .    with the assumption @xmath61",
    ", we find from the above relation that @xmath62 may be determined by    @xmath63      because the objects we use to calibrate our ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 ) diagram in  3 are typically at low galactic latitudes , we must correct for extinction by dust .",
    "we adopt the average interstellar extinction curve for @xmath64 of @xcite . for the @xmath6 ( @xmath65   , @xmath66 , @xcite ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath67   , @xmath68 ) filters we obtain @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "subgiants and dwarfs are also well discriminated , but , as might be expected , the separation begins to break down for bluer colors , near the main sequence turn off . with the new data presented here , we sample this important color regime with a large number of stars , with the aim of defining a useful guide for dwarf / giant demarcation in surveys of field stars .",
    "data for all of the star clusters presented here , except for melotte 66 , were obtained with the site # 1 2048@xmath15 ccd attached to the swope 1-m on the nights of ut 15 - 17 march 1997 .",

    "we used the `` carnegie 3-inch washington filter set '' to which we added a @xmath0 filter .",

    "this filter is similar to the one described by @xcite , but with a slightly larger peak transmission ( 88% versus geisler s 75% ) and a very slightly narrower passband ( half transmission at about 5095   and 5200   ) .",
    "our cluster observations were calibrated with geisler s ( 1990 ) sa98 , sa110 , and ngc 3680 standard star fields , accounting for color , airmass , and , in the case of the @xmath6 band , ( airmass ) @xmath79 ( color ) terms , along the lines of the procedure followed in @xcite . for the @xmath6 and @xmath25 solutions ,",
    "the ( @xmath2 ) color was used , whereas , for the @xmath0 solution , an ( @xmath4 ) color was used . for the first two nights of the march run , during which standard stars were measured , the solution was allowed to determine individual night zero - points , and these agreed to better than 0.013 in all cases . the extinction was assumed to be constant over all three march 1997 nights . in each of the @xmath6 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 solutions , there were 88 , 69 and 64 useful standard stars , yielding solutions with rms errors of 0.0036 , 0.0051 and 0.0073 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "our photometric catalogue for the intermediate aged @xcite cluster ngc 3680 employed ten @xmath6 , eight @xmath25 and nine @xmath0 frames having integration times in the ranges of 5 - 8 seconds , 5 - 8 seconds and 50 - 90 seconds respectively .",
    "the images included geisler s ( 1984 ) calibration sequence in the washington system .",

    "@xcite determined the abundance of ngc 3680 to be [ fe / h]@xmath87 , but an analysis of the cmd based on members cleaned of binary systems by naa97 gives [ fe / h ] = + 0.11 ( similar to the value of + 0.09 @xmath88 of @xcite ) and an age of 1.45 @xmath89 0.3 gyr .",
    "a significant amount of field star contamination is evident in the ngc 3680 cmd , especially around @xmath90 , which is near the main sequence turn - off of old disk field stars ( @xmath91 ) .",

    "we have cross - referenced our photometric catalogue to both the proper motion catalogue of ( * ? ? ?",

    "this allows us to separate true ngc 3680 members from the numerous field star contaminants , and also eliminate binary stars . in figure 6a",
    "we show the cmd for only those stars having measured proper motions by k95 and with determined joint proper motion - spatial membership probability @xmath92 . this low value was selected to mimic k95 s own selection ( see figure 8 in k95 ) and intended to preserve some fainter stars in the cluster cmd ( faint stars tend to have lower @xmath93 in the k95 survey ) .",
    "however , as k95 point out , this liberal cut probably results in contamination of the lower main sequence by field stars ( e.g. , the proper motion errors in k95 begin to grow substantially for @xmath94 ) .",
    "therefore , with larger symbols we denote a more conservative cut with the k95 estimator cutoff at @xmath95 . in figure",

    "figure 6c looks qualitatively similar to naa97 s ( @xmath97 ) cmd for ngc 3680 .",
    "it can be seen , from the general agreement of the points with the @xcite loci for [ fe / h]=0 stars , that the likely ngc 3680 giants , near @xmath98 , as well as the likely main sequence stars more or less fall in the appropriate places in the color - color diagram .",
    "the rich open cluster ngc 2477 was observed in order to get a large sample of likely lower main sequence stars .",
    "unfortunately , extending the cluster main sequence as faint as possible resulted in the saturation of our frames for a majority of the suspected cluster giants , which are lost from our analysis .",
    "we obtained two @xmath6 , three @xmath25 and two @xmath0 ccd exposures , for integrations of 60 - 80 seconds , 60 seconds , and 600 seconds each , respectively . again",
    "daophot ii was used to create a calibrated photometric catalogue . in figure 7",
    "we present the ( @xmath6 , @xmath2)@xmath96 cmd for 11,300 stars in the field of ngc 2477 .",
    "previous studies suggest the cluster shows substantial differential reddening , from @xmath99 to 0.4 @xcite ; following @xcite and @xcite , we have adopted a mean @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this translates to @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the resultant cmd in figure 7 is qualitatively identical with the @xmath105 cmd of @xcite , apart from the lack of a concentration of giants in our cmd .",
    "the broadening of the upper main sequence has been attributed to the differential reddening , and this is supported by the fact that the lower main sequence , which more nearly parallels the reddening vector , is thinner , particularly in the ( @xmath106 ) cmd @xcite .",
    "cluster parameters for ngc 2477 have most recently been determined by isochrone fitting in @xcite .",
    "this latter study finds best fits to [ fe / h ] = @xmath107 and an age of @xmath108 gyr .",
    "earlier age estimates were slightly higher , e.g. , 1.5 @xmath89 0.2 gyr @xcite and 1.2 @xmath89 0.3 gyr @xcite , but @xcite , who used the same theoretical isochrones as @xcite but on the @xcite data , obtained 0.6 @xmath109 gyr .",
    "the white dwarf cooling curve age of the cluster tends to support the higher ages , around 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "the best fitting @xcite abundance for ngc 2477 is slightly lower , but not significantly so , from the [ fe / h]=0.04 value of @xcite .    in spite of the amount of attention ngc 2477",
    "has received lately by way of deep studies @xcite , no membership study , even at the bright end of the cmd , exists for this cluster . in an attempt to improve our chances of selecting true ngc 2477 main sequence stars so that we might better delineate the dwarf locus in the ( @xmath110 , @xmath111)@xmath96 diagram , we reduce the field sample by limiting the cmd to stars in two specific radii ",
    "@xmath112 ( figures 8a - b ) and @xmath113 ( figures 8c - d )  about the nominal cluster center ( which was judged by finding the peak of the x and y marginal distribution histogram of starcounts for @xmath114 ) .",
    "by eye we selected stars along the apparently least - reddened ngc 2477 main sequence and show their position in the two - color diagram in figures 8b and 8d ( _ large dots _ ) .",
    "the small dots show a large population of apparent metal - rich field giants along the predicted @xcite [ fe / h]=0 giant locus , while the predicted trend for the selected dwarf sequence is clearly borne out by the data .",
    "the spreading of the locus at redder ( @xmath2)@xmath96 colors is a consequence both of the increased photometric error for the fainter stars in the sequence as well the contribution of differential reddening , which increases as the dwarf sequence curves ever more perpendicular to the reddening vector in the lower part of the diagram .",
    "note the much larger spread in the unselected stars in figures 8b and 8d .",
    "this spread about the locus is partly due to large photometric errors at the faint limit of the catalogue ( as high as 0.4 magnitudes in the colors ) .",
    "however , the larger bulk of stars _ above _ the dwarf locus hints at a substantial population of field giants in this low latitude ( @xmath115 ) field .",
    "melotte 66 has long been recognized as an archetypal old open cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies estimate an age for the cluster of @xmath116 gyr @xcite and @xmath117 gyr @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopt an abundance of [ fe / h]=@xmath118 , based on @xcite , which is similar to the adopted abundance ( [ fe / h]=@xmath119 ) of @xcite .",
    "however , an intrinsic metallicity spread among the cluster giants has also been detected @xcite .",
    "the reddening to the cluster does not seem well established , although @xcite settle on @xmath120 as the reddening that gives the most consistent ultraviolet excesses between the cluster dwarfs and giants .",
    "we adopt this value , so that @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we obtained single @xmath6 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 exposures of melotte 66 with integration times of 12 , 12 and 100 seconds , respectively , for the dec 1997 run .",
    "these were calibrated with 67 , 59 and 60 useful standard stars in the @xmath6 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 bands , respectively , yielding solutions with random errors of 0.0094 , 0.0074 and 0.0109 magnitudes , respectively . with these exposure times",
    ", we were able to get reliable photometry for all but the very brightest part of the red giant branch .",
    "we present in figure 9 the cmd in our filter system for the field of melotte 66 .",
    "there is substantial field contamination , but the main sequence turn off region and the red clump of the cluster can be discerned easily .    while it is in somewhat better shape than either ngc 3680 or ngc 2477 , melotte 66 is still in need of a better membership census .",
    "some radial velocity memberships exist and in figures 10a and 10b we show those stars listed as members by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and from the @xcite analysis listed in @xcite .",
    "the result shows the prominent double cmd sequence caused by the substantial binary fraction in the cluster .",
    "this duplication causes both the double subgiant branches as well as a fattening of the msto region ( see figures 9 and 10c ) .",
    "we show the @xmath124 diagram corresponding to the identified members in figure 10b . here",
    "we delineate two groups of radial velocity member giants / subgiants : those falling more or less in the expected region of the color - color diagram ( _ open circles _ ) and those in more peculiar locations , more like expectations for dwarf stars ( _ closed circles _ ) .",
    "it can be seen that the peculiarly - placed stars in figure 10b seem to be predominantly associated with the upper subgiant branch , that of the binary stars , although a few stars , near @xmath125 , are found below this subgiant branch .",
    "it may be that the wide scatter in @xmath126 color near @xmath127 in figure 10b ( and figure 10d below ) , which gives rise to `` problem giant stars '' in the dwarf region of the two - color diagram , may be due to problems with the binarity .",
    "it is interesting also to note that many of these `` problem stars '' have abnormally large daophot @xmath128 parameters compared to other stars at similar magnitudes .",
    "perhaps this is some indication of a slight resolution of close binaries that is detectable by daophot .    in figures 10c and 10d ,",
    "we attempt to elucidate the true nature of the red giant branch for the cluster by limiting our field to a radius of @xmath129 . in figure 10c we trace likely cluster members using the known radial velocity members ( shown in figure 10c whether or not they fall within the @xmath129 radius ) and both the single and binary isochrones in figure 9d of @xcite as guides .",
    "once again , we use _ open _ and _ closed _ circles to delineate stars with `` problematical '' colors from the standpoint of dwarf / giant separation .",
    "we trace down the red giant branch to the red clump and down the subgiant branch to the point where both the binaries and the single stars join their respective main sequence turnoffs .",
    "all other stars within @xmath129 of the cluster center are left as small symbols in figures 10c and 10d . in figure 10d",
    "the giants above the red clump follow the @xcite locus for solar metallicity giants .",
    "as expected ( from , for example , figure 4 ) , the subgiant locus in figure 10d merges with , and becomes less discriminated from , the locus of main sequence turnoff stars ( small points ) at bluer colors . the latter sweep lower than the main locus of giant stars in figure 10d , as expected .",
    "finally , we note again a predilection for the `` giants '' with problematical locations in the two - color diagram to be associated with the subgiant branch for binary members .",
    "because of its proximity and size , @xmath5 centauri is a convenient target that provides numerous bright giant stars for use as calibrators .",
    "moreover , with an abundance ranging from solar to [ fe / h]@xmath130 @xcite , this one cluster allows the opportunity to explore the abundance sensitivity of the @xmath4 index , as well as to calibrate the giant star color - magnitude relation as a function of metallicity for old stellar populations , without introduction of relative systematic errors produced by differential distance errors . to explore the giant distribution in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 ) and the ( @xmath2 , @xmath6 ) planes , we have made an extensive imaging survey of the globular cluster @xmath5 centauri .",
    "our @xmath5 cen data consists of eight separate pointings , offset by @xmath131 in each the north , south , east , west , northeast , northwest , southeast , and southwest directions .",
    "our resulting catalogue contains over 100,000 stars photometered , in general , two or three times each , with daophot .",
    "the data were matched into catalogues using daomaster .",
    "the washington cmd for @xmath5 centauri is presented in figure 11 .",
    "we have adopted @xmath132 as in @xcite ; this translates to @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "two points are worth mentioning about figure 11 .",
    "first , as it is meant only for illustrative purposes , this figure has not yet been cleaned of multiple detections on overlapping frames , so that some stars appearing in overlap regions are represented two to three times .",
    "second , because of saturation at the bright end , we have lost some of the very brightest , reddest @xmath5 cen giants in this truncated cmd .",
    "an interesting aspect of figure 11 is the appearance of several distinct rgbs , an aspect we explore further elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have cross - referenced our catalogue with the spectroscopic sample of @xcite .",
    "the latter is a careful analysis of abundance patterns in @xmath5 cen giants , and also provides a membership list of 343 radial velocity members , stars that were selected in the first place as likely members based on proper motions .",
    "the stars studied by @xcite were in two distinct magnitude ranges , one on the giant branch and one along the subgiant branch .    in figure 12a",
    ", we show the distribution of the @xcite giants in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath6)@xmath96 diagram , and in figure 12b we show their distribution in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath4)@xmath96 plane .",
    "giants with different metallicity ranges are indicated by different symbols .",
    "the [ fe / h ] ranges were selected so that the mean abundance in each metallicity bin corresponded to more or less convenient [ fe / h ] values ( -1.74 , -1.60 , -1.40 , -1.20 , -0.95 ) on the @xcite abundance scale ; the most metal - rich bin contains a single star at [ fe / h ] = -0.62 .",
    "the distribution of points in figure 12b demonstrates that while the @xmath4 index is less sensitive to broad metallicity changes than it is to luminosity class differences ( note the compressed range of @xmath4 in figure 12b ) , the ( @xmath2 , @xmath4)@xmath96 plane is still able to discriminate roughly between metal - poor and metal - rich giants .",
    "the @xmath5 cen red giant branch is relatively well defined in figure 11 .",
    "a well defined rgb will be useful for our future studies , e.g. , as a means to estimate rough photometric parallaxes for giants with washington photometry .",
    "for each abundance , we fit the center of the rgb sequence analytically ( using the iraftask curfit ) to equations of the form            especially at the extreme ends of the @xmath5 cen abundance range , however , we found these fits to be unsatisfactorily constrained due to the small sample sizes , poor distribution in @xmath138 color , and the contribution of photometric errors , which become larger than the mean separation of @xmath139 colors for the metal - poor loci .",
    "the bimodal @xmath138 distribution of the data gave rise to unlikely `` bowing '' between nodes fixed by the two concentration of points .",
    "therefore , to give a more realistic and natural fit to the data , we have taken advantage of the synthetic curves derived for cluster cmds by @xcite , which we `` calibrate '' to our data for @xmath5 cen .",
    "this forging of the synthetic loci to the actual data has the added advantage of extending the usefulness of the @xmath5 cen example to abundance ranges outside those encompassed by the cluster itself , if we assume the _ relative _ placement of the synthetic loci is accurate . after trying various schemes to marry the synthetic and empirical loci , we found that we could obtain reasonable matches of the @xcite curves to the empirical distributions by metallicity with a simple 0.25 mag blueward translation ( in @xmath2 ) and a slight ( @xmath140 ) rotation of the @xcite curves in the two - color plane . thus we find @xmath141        note these relations are defined for the @xcite rgb 14 gyr isochrones , and may not be applicable to their other models , and for clarity they were not considered in the previous discussion of the open clusters .",
    "as pointed out in  1.2 , the need to transform the @xcite relations is likely due to the nonstandard passbands adopted by @xcite @xcite , and it confirms the finding by @xcite that their isochrones are systematically redder than actual globular cluster red giant branches .",
    "table 2 includes the original empirical fits to the metallicity bins in table 1 .",
    "we include only the [ fe / h]@xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 groups , which guided our transformation , in figure 12b ( dashed lines ) , along with the revised @xcite rgb loci ( solid lines ) , and illustrates the reasonable matches of the latter to the @xmath5 cen data . for future analytical ease the rotated @xcite loci",
    "have been fit by equations ( 7 ) .",
    "the coefficients for these new relations are given in table 2 for the various metallicities .",
    "the difference in the mean abundances for the listed loci in table 2 compared to table 1 is a result of our adopting the @xcite rgb curves ( and therefore their abundance selections ) for the latter .    to obtain the absolute magnitude , @xmath146 for a star using the relations in table 1",
    ", one must correct the calculated apparent magnitude for the @xmath5 cen distance modulus , which may be taken as ( m - m)@xmath147 @xcite , as well as the extinction in the @xmath6 band ( @xmath135 for @xmath132 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that since we have not been able to discriminate between first ascent red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars , the relations in table 1 may tend to give systematically overluminous magnitudes if applied to individual first ascent giant branch stars .",
    "the ratio of first ascent to asymptotic giant branch stars in the brighter magnitude range in figure 12a ( i.e. above the horizontal branch ) may be something like four to one @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the halo of the galaxy evolved roughly similarly to @xmath5 cen , with a similar age - metallicity relation and initial mass function , then we might expect a similar first ascent to asymptotic giant branch ratio in the field , and application of the table 1 relations to finding distances for halo field stars should provide results that are at least statistically correct for an ensemble of giant stars .      in a series of papers over more than a decade doug geisler and collaborators ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , have continued to refine calibration of the washington photometry system through extensive observations of giant stars in open and globular clusters of all metallicities . in many cases ,",
    "the washington data presented have been supplemented with observations in the @xmath0 filter as a means to discriminate cluster giants from foreground dwarfs . in figure",
    "13b we compile these data in the two - color diagram of interest to our analysis ( similar to figure 12b ) .",
    "many of the stars were observed less frequently in @xmath0 than in the other filters , and this has resulted in larger errors in the @xmath4 color . because of the sensitivity of the technique on relatively reliable @xmath4 colors , we have excluded all stars which have fewer than three measures in @xmath0 . in figure 13a",
    "we show the @xmath148 color - absolute magnitude diagram for those stars with available magnitude data in addition to colors .",
    "table 3 summarizes the data employed in the construction of figure 13 . in both table 3 and",
    "figure 13 the clusters are grouped according to [ fe / h ] ( with groups defined by the curves in figure 13b ) , where the [ fe / h ] and other data are from @xcite for the open clusters and from @xcite for the globular clusters , with two exceptions : the distance moduli for ngc 2360 and ngc 6809 are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for these particular clusters",
    "the values listed in the databases of @xcite and @xcite differ significantly from those in the literature ( and we suspect an error in the databases ) .",
    "figure 13 demonstrates that the general trends with [ fe / h ] seen in the @xmath5 cen giants are exhibited in the cluster giant population as a whole ",
    "namely , that the giants in the most metal - poor clusters show almost no variation of @xmath139 color with @xmath138 , while more metal - rich cluster giants have progressively smaller @xmath139 , particularly at redder @xmath138 , as shown in figure 12b .",
    "we have plotted the five color - color curves calibrated by the various metallicity populations in @xmath5 cen ( table 2 ) , with metallicity increasing towards the curves with smaller @xmath139 .",
    "we also include in figure 13b the rough dwarf / giant demarcation ( _ straight solid lines _ ) recommended in the next section .",
    "it may be seen that , apart from the very reddest and the very bluest stars , the majority of the giants lie above this demarcation line .",
    "the red upturn in the demarcating line is necessitated by the overlap with red dwarfs at @xmath149 ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "for a given abundance range the cluster data in table 3 , however , show much larger scatter in both figure 13a and 13b compared to the @xmath5 cen giants in figures 12a and 12b .",
    "this is partly due to the heterogeneity in the sources and techniques employed to measure the fundamental parameters of distance , abundance and reddening for the table 3 data .",
    "of course , there is also a considerable spread in ages in the objects in table 3 , particularly with the inclusion of the open clusters , which contributes to the spreading of the distributions in figure 13 .",
    "in contrast , the @xcite isochrones we have used were derived from models with ages ( 14 gyr ) appropriate for globular cluster giant branches .    because of the various problems with the heterogeneity of the data , we do not use figure 13 to calculate general formulae for the conversion of color into absolute magnitude , as we did in tables 1 and 2 for the @xmath5 cen giants .",
    "we provide the figure 13 data here to lend ancillary support to our assertion that rough abundance discrimination is possible in the @xmath150 diagram .",
    "while it would be nice to extend our table 1 calibrations to higher abundances through inclusion of the metal - rich open clusters , for our present purposes there is no urgency for this since at the magnitudes and galactic latitudes of our first applications of the technique we do not expect to encounter many giants with the metallicities and ages in the range of the metal - rich open clusters .",
    "we aim to return to this problem if and as needed .",
    "we reiterate that much better photometric abundances can be had with inclusion of the washington @xmath37 filter , as the numerous references listed in table 3 can attest .",
    "however , our goal here is ( 1 ) to identify the minimal amount of photometric data necessary to _ find _ field giants that we have already begun to observe spectroscopically for radial velocities and , of course , abundances , and ( 2 ) to point out the additional leverage that our three color filter system has in characterizing the relative abundance of our giant star candidates .      in figure 14",
    ", we combine the two - color data of our open cluster main sequences from ngc 3680 ( both single and binary radial velocity members in figure 6d ) and ngc 2477 ( those stars selected as main sequence in figure 8d ) , our red giants from ngc 3680 ( both single and binary radial velocity members in figure 6d ) and @xmath5 cen ( figure 12b ) , the red giant and subgiant branch of melotte 66 ( radial velocity members from the single star locus only , figure 10b ) , the solar abundance field giants from @xcite , as well as the data on field dwarfs and giants from @xcite , and giants from @xcite ( figure 4 ) and the clusters listed in table 3 .",
    "all evolved stars , from geisler s single luminosity class `` iv - v '' to class i , are lumped into one group ( `` non - dwarfs '' ) , as are all of the stars we show from the melotte 66 red giant / subgiant branch .",
    "note that @xcite specifically investigates the sensitivity of the @xmath139 color to giants of different surface gravities and he finds little separation for giants of similar temperatures and metallicities but different log@xmath151 .",
    "we see that the discrimination of evolved stars and dwarfs is rather good over a broad range of @xmath2 , breaking down only at the bluish colors ( @xmath152 ) of subgiant stars just evolved from the main sequence , and at the red end , starting around the colors of late k stars ( @xmath153 ) , where overlap with dwarfs occurs again .",
    "the _ straight solid lines _ in the diagram roughly demarcate the region above which one might expect to find predominantly subgiant and giant stars .",
    "the `` non - dwarf '' objects that fall below these lines in figure 14 are generally geisler stars classified as subgiants , the lowest luminosity melotte 66 subgiants , as well as the peculiar group of melotte 66 stars ( with @xmath154 ) discussed above .",
    "the rather clear separation in figure 14 motivates our survey for distant giant stars . with a 1-m class telescope and ccd imaging",
    "it is easy to obtain the photometric precision necessary to pick out rather complete samples of giant stars to distances of hundreds of kiloparsecs . by adopting this technique ,",
    "we intend to explore the halo and local environment of the milky way and other galaxies in the local group with modest sized telescopes .",
