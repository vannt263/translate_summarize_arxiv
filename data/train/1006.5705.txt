    "in recent years the study of quantum halo systems experienced increased interest in the nuclear as well as the atomic few - body community .",
    "for a recent review see ref .",
    "the nucleus @xmath3he is of particular interest , since it constitutes the lightest two - neutron halo nucleus with a @xmath4he core .",
    "being an effective three - body system , the properties of the ground state have been explored using either faddeev  @xcite or hyper - spherical harmonics ( hh )  @xcite .",
    "more recently the ground state has also been calculated with multi - cluster methods  @xcite as well as with gfmc  @xcite .",
    "those multi - cluster methods include various techniques like the microscopic dynamical multi - configuration three - cluster model  @xcite , the stochastic variational method  @xcite , the multi - cluster dynamic model ( mdmp and amdmp ) , the hybrid - tv model , a combination of the cluster orbital shell model ( cosm )  @xcite and the extended cluster model ( ecm )  @xcite , the refined resonating group method  @xcite , and the coupled - rearrangement - channel variational method with gaussian basis functions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the beta decay to the alpha+d continuum has been studied  @xcite .",
    "of interest is also the two - neutron capture process @xmath4he(2n,@xmath2)@xmath3he as a possible route bridging the instability gap at nuclear mass a=5  @xcite .",
    "the situation is quite different in the continuum of two neutrons and an @xmath0 -particle .",
    "there is a well established @xmath5 resonance @xcite , but further resonant structures are still under debate @xcite . up to now more indirect approaches in understanding the resonance structure have been carried out , e.g. the four - body distorted wave approach , leading to three - body continuum excitations of two - neutron borromean halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , complex scaling in coulomb break - up reactions has been employed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an extension of the hh method on a lagrange mesh  @xcite has been used to study three - body continuum states .",
    "this is at least a four - body problem with great uncertainties about the reaction mechanisms and the interactions entering these much more complicated systems .",
    "thus , the currently predominant approach to continuum calculations for the pure @xmath6 system is the hh method  @xcite .",
    "a faddeev approach is to the best of our knowledge still missing . only for the @xmath3li nucleus ,",
    "a faddeev treatment of the deuteron - alpha ( d-@xmath0 ) system has been employed  @xcite , which however , did not have to face the challenge of three - to - three scattering .",
    "this also refers to the pioneering work by koike  @xcite on d-@xmath0 scattering .",
    "the aim of this investigation is to fill that gap . for the @xmath6 system one",
    "faces the situation of three free particles being in the initial channel and leading again to three free particles in the exit channel . in other words",
    ", one has to deal with three - to - three scattering .",
    "scattering of three free incoming particles to three free outgoing ones in a faddeev approach has been initiated in  @xcite in the context of the three - body photo disintegration of @xmath7he .",
    "this path has also been followed in the same context and in a faddeev approach by meijgaard and tjon  @xcite . into the matrix element for the photo disintegration",
    "enters the three - nucleon to three - nucleon scattering wave function , which has been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite and then inserted into the photodisintegration matrix element .",
    "however , evaluating the wave function is a completely unnecessary complication , since this process is initiated by the three - nucleon bound state .",
    "one can directly derive a faddeev equation for the three - body break up amplitude , in which the driving term contains the action of the current operator on the @xmath7he ground state .",
    "then , the complete final state interaction is generated by a faddeev integral kernel for the amplitude .",
    "this considerably simplifies the technical part of a calculation , since no disconnected processes occur .",
    "this very procedure has been pioneered in refs .",
    "@xcite and is being applied in state - of - the - art calculations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the same procedure can trivially be adapted to the capture process @xmath8he@xmath9 , as will be displayed in the present investigation .",
    "this capture process is relevant for the production rate of @xmath3he in astrophysical environments  @xcite characterized by high neutron and alpha densities e.g. those related to supernova shock fronts . in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite this three - body process is approximated by sequential two - body processes , whereas in principle a genuine three - body reactions needs to be calculated .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath10 amplitude is relevant for determining the the next order coefficient  @xcite in the virial equation of state in low - density matter  @xcite .    from a technical point of view the faddeev approach to the @xmath11 continuum",
    "is strongly needed , since the currently predominant approach , namely the hyper - spherical harmonics ( hh ) approach , still faces open challenges .",
    "it is already known that in the break up process @xmath12 a strong fsi peak appears for the @xmath13 subsystem . in the faddeev approach using jacobi momenta this can be mapped out correctly , whereas when changing to the hyper - spherical angle , the convergences is quite poor for this particular configuration . in the hh method , the control of the coupling potentials can be a painful exercise , whereas in the faddeev approach using jacobi variables the dynamics is perfectly well under control in all details . this same situation must be expected in @xmath6 scattering , where the three - body s - matrix is characterized by continuous quantum numbers describing how the energy is distributed over the relative motion",
    ". there are strong initial and final state interaction peaks , which in a discrete representation through hyper - spherical k - quantum numbers are difficult to map out correctly . as stated above only a technically reliable approach as the faddeev one will guarantee the validity of the results when searching for @xmath3he resonances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the coupled faddeev equations for the three - to - three scattering amplitude , followed by a partial wave decomposition in section iii .",
    "the faddeev equations will be solved by iteration yielding a multiple scattering series .",
    "this will be outlined in section iv . since most of the faddeev type investigations of the @xmath6 system",
    "are based on finite rank forces , we also present in section v a continuum formulation based on separable forces .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the the unitarity relation for the three - to - three amplitude in section vi . finally the capture process @xmath14he+@xmath2 will be discussed for the faddeev scheme in section vii .",
    "then we summarize in section vii .",
    "technical details about the partial wave decomposition and an efficient way of treating the three - body singularities are given in the appendices .",
    "in developing the formal expression for the transition amplitude between three free particles interacting with short - range , strong interactions , we start from the triad of lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equations  @xcite acting on a three - particle initial state given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a two - body scattering state , and the index @xmath17 indicates the three choices of pairs characterized by the third particle , the spectator .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the pair forces .",
    "three - body forces can in principle be incorporated in a straightforward fashion .",
    "however , we will only concentrate on two - body forces here .",
    "the triad of ls equations , @xmath21 define the scattering wave uniquely .",
    "the channel green s function is given by @xmath22 .",
    "we use standard jacobi momenta @xmath23 and @xmath24 and their quantum numbers as basis states .    by suitable multiplication of the three equations in the triad from the left by @xmath25 one obtains the transition operators @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , which fulfill the set of equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the free three - particle state .",
    "the three - body break up operator is given by @xmath30 again , from the triad follows @xmath31    iterating eq .",

    "fixing arbitrarily the alpha particle as spectator and label it as `` 1 '' and the two neutrons as particles `` 2 '' and `` 3 '' , the scattering wave function @xmath39 must be antisymmetric under the exchange of particles `` 2 '' and `` 3 '' . thus , defining the transposition operator @xmath40 , the scattering wave function must fulfill @xmath41 . using this in eq .",

    "these singularities can be reliably treated @xcite . however , the method suggested in refs .",

    "@xcite , who note , that even for a maximum @xmath159 in their calculation , the result is not completely converged .    a corresponding investigation in the faddeev approach is still missing .",
