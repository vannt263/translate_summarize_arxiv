    "the x - ray spectrum of mr2251 - 178 was first studied by halpern ( 1984 ) who deduced the presence of a warm absorber based on the observed variability pattern of the data .",
    "based on _ exosat _ and _ ginga _ observations pan et al . ( 1990 ) and mineo & stewart ( 1993 ) , again , interpreted and modeled the data in terms of the presence of a warm absorber . in particular , mineo & stewart found the ionization state of the absorber to follow changes in the intrinsic continuum luminosity .",
    "an independent analysis of the data was performed by walter & courvoisier ( 1992 ) , who concluded that the previously reported variability could be completely traced back to variability in the powerlaw index ( and _ constant cold _",

    "3 . we first removed all sources detected with a likelihood @xmath11 in the pspc field of view . in the next step , eight source - free background regions symmetrically distributed around the target region , but in the outer parts of the field of view , were selected and the mean background count rate was determined",
    "we then derived the background - corrected number of photons in a circular region of 150  radius , with its position close to the optical center of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "a number of 89 excess photons is detected .",
    "these could either originate from unresolved point sources , or represent emission from the intracluster gas .",
    "we conservatively assume that all excess photons originate from the intracluster medium ( icm ) in order to derive an upper limit on its x - ray emission .",
    "to convert the countrate to x - ray luminosity , we used a raymond - smith emission model and assumed an icm temperature of ( i ) @xmath12 = 5 kev ( typical for clusters of galaxies ) and ( ii ) 1.5 kev ( more typical for groups of galaxies ) .",
    "this yields x - ray luminosities of @xmath13 erg / s and @xmath14 erg / s , respectively .",
    "the mean source count rate during the pointed observation was 3.1 cts / s , a factor of 3 higher than during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) observation performed 3 years earlier .",
    "the x - ray lightcurves are displayed in fig .",
    "4 . we find evidence for a remarkable flaring event with a rise time of 10000 sec and an amplitude of a factor 2 in count rate which ocurred during the rass ( fig .",

    "it is interesting to mention here the luminous quasar pds 456 , where a similar flaring event ( factor 2 rise in countrate within 17ksec ) was seen ( reeves et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in order to study variability during the pointed observation , in a first step",
    "a time binning of 400s was adopted to account for the wobble motion of the satellite ( fig .",

    ", we chose time bins of 20s .",
    "on average , this still gives @xmath560 source counts per bin .",
    "the wobble - induced source variability is expected to be less than @xmath530% .",
    "we find repeated short - term variability by up to a factor 2 in count rate ( not visible in the lower panel of fig . 4 where time bins were 400s each ) , unexpected for such a luminous quasar .",
    "first , we fit a single powerlaw to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the column density of cold absorbing material was fixed to the galactic value towards mr2251 - 178 , @xmath15 @xmath16 ( lockman & savage 1995 ) , since it is underpredicted otherwise ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath17 and clearly is a very poor description of the data ( @xmath18 ; fig .",
    "a raymond - smith emission model does not fit the spectrum at all , even if temperature , metal abundances and the amount of cold absorption are all treated as free parameters .",
    "we then tried two - component spectral fits involving a powerlaw plus soft excess parametrized by different models .",

    "this still holds if we ignore in the fitting procedure the first three spectral bins which always show a positive deviation from the best fit model .",

    "if this part of the spectrum is excluded from the spectral fitting , we obtain @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .    next , a warm absorber model based on photoionization calculations ( komossa & fink 1997a ) with the code _ cloudy _ ( ferland 1993 ) was applied .",

    "the spectral energy distribution incident on the warm material was chosen to be a mean seyfert continuum taken from komossa & schulz ( 1997)=1.4 extending up to 0.1 kev , a mean optical to radio continuum after padovani & rafanelli ( 1988 ) , a break at 10@xmath49 m and an index @xmath50 = 2.5 @xmath51-longwards . for comments on the usually weak influence of non - x - ray spectral parts on the warm absorption structure",
    "see komossa & fink ( 1997a ) .",
    "the soft x - ray continuum was directly determined from spectral fits ( @xmath21 = 1.9 ) and extrapolated to higher energies , with a break at 100 kev . ] .",
    "the two properties characterizing the warm absorber that can be directly extracted from x - ray spectral fitting are the hydrogen column density @xmath52 of the ionized material and the ionization parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number rate of incident photons above the lyman limit , @xmath56 is the distance between nucleus and warm absorber , @xmath57 is the hydrogen number density and @xmath58 the speed of light .",
    "a fit of the x - ray spectrum of mr2251 - 178 gives an ionization parameter of the warm absorber @xmath0 and a column density @xmath1 .",
    "we then split the total data set in three subsets according to flux - state of the source , and fit these data separately .",
    "the best - fit parameters remain the same within the error bars ; no changes in the warm absorber are detected .",
    "this also holds for the rass observation performed 3 yrs earlier ; the best - fit column density is a factor 3 lower , but consistent with being constant within the errors .",
    "the best - fit warm absorber model still leaves some residuals at the low energy - part of the spectrum , suggesting the presence of a second , lower ionized absorber which could possibly be dusty ( see komossa 1999 for a review on dusty warm absorbers ) .",

    "chandra_.    integration over the best - fit x - ray spectrum ( we used model 6a of table 2 ) after correction for cold and warm absorption gives a mean rest - frame luminosity of @xmath59 erg / s .",

    "mr2251 - 178 is one of the few quasars that host warm absorbers .",
    "our simple one - component warm absorber fit gives a high column density of the ionized material , similar to that seen in ngc4051 ( e.g. , komossa & fink 1997a ) .",
    "we have checked that none of the observed optical - uv emission lines of mr2251 - 178 are overpredicted by our best - fit warm absorber model .",
    "for instance , we derive a warm - absorber intrinsic intensity ratio in the emission lines [ fexiv]@xmath515303/h@xmath67 of 0.02 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the optical emission - line gas which surrounds mr2251 - 178 is of huge hydrogen column density .",
    "essentially , two components have been distinguished : a circumnuclear component with an extent of @xmath520 kpc , and a giant envelope which extends up to @xmath5200 kpc .",
    "bergeron et al . ( 1983 ) provided crude estimates of the mean _ ionized _ gas densities of @xmath68 cm@xmath9 and @xmath70 cm@xmath9 for the circumnuclear component and the envelope , respectively , with uncertainties larger than a factor 10 .",

    "the oxygen ion species of lowest ionization with significant abundance is o@xmath71 .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of the ionized gas envelope around mr2251 - 178 , including a merger remnant as result of a merger event between mr2251 - 178 and a small , gas - rich spiral galaxy ; tidally stripped gas from the neighbour galaxy ; the ionized part of a large hi envelope , possibly left over from the formation epoch of the quasar ; or material expelled from the qso ( e.g. , bergeron et al . 1983 , norgaard - nielsen et al .",
    "1986 , macchetto et al .",
    "based on the extent , symmetry , and rotation pattern of the envelope , shopbell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) conclude that the interaction model is unlikely and that the envelope most probably did not originate within the host galaxy of the quasar .",
    "they favor a model in which the extended hii envelope resides within a large complex of hi gas centered about the quasar .",
    "is has repeatedly been suggested to search for such an hi halo using the 21 cm line ( e.g. , bergeron et al .",
    "1983 , macchetto et al .",
    "1990 , shopbell et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "alternative to radio observations , soft x - rays are an excellent probe of excess absorption from cold material along the line of sight .",
    "such absorption is expected , firstly , from the hii gas component itself ( more likely from the envelope than the circumnuclear component ) if more than @xmath51% of h is neutral , and , secondly , from the hi envelope .",

    "@xmath16 and re - fit the x - ray spectrum , the fit is drastically worse , with a change @xmath72 = 187 .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath73 @xmath16 as an upper limit to the excess absorption along the line of sight .",
    "] we conclude that the ionized gas nebula does not posses a significant neutral gas component , and that there can not be an extended giant hi envelope along the line of sight .    it is tempting to speculate that the quasar s x - ray emission is completely absorbed in the _ rosat _ band and we only see an extended x - ray emission component in the foreground , maybe from a giant x - ray halo . however , the x - ray variability of the quasar detected during the present and earlier observations ( e.g. , pan et al .",
    "1990 ) excludes this possibility .",
    "given the high ratio of @xmath74/@xmath75 of mr2251 - 178 ( ricker et al .",
    "1978 ) , is it possible that a cooling flow contributes to its x - ray emission ? in this context , it is also interesting to note that recently , evidence has been reported for the presence of highly ionized oxygen absorption in cluster cooling flows ( e.g. , buote 2000 ) .",
    "we consider the contribution of a cooling flow very unlikely , though , because ( i ) mr2251 - 178 is known to be highly variable , ( ii ) the quasar appears to be located far from the center of the cluster , in its outskirts , and ( iii ) macchetto et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and shopbell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) present evidence that the extended [ oiii ] envelope is not linked to a cooling flow .      whereas the bulk of the x - ray emission from mr2251 - 178 is consistent with a point - source origin",
    ", there is some extended emission at weak emission levels .",
    "the most interesting feature is a ` bridge ' between the quasar and the cd galaxy of the cluster .",
    "presently , it is unclear , whether this emission region is indeed a filament of extended emission that connects the cd galaxy and mr2251 - 178 , or whether it corresponds to several unresolved point sources , or whether the two sources x23 and x24 ( fig . 1 , 2 ) are extended . if real , a giant outflow cone , or the remnant of a past interaction with the cd galaxy are possible explanations of the filament .",
    "given the present uncertainties , we do not speculate further about its origin .",
    "the feature is potentially very interesting , though , and should be searched for with _",
    "xmm _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "an excess of x - ray sources is detected east of mr2251 - 178 .",
    "we find 19 sources in a region of 20@xmath7620   above a flux level of 210@xmath77 erg@xmath16s , whereas only 4.7 sources are expected according to the the @xmath78 distribution of hasinger et al .",
    "this corresponds to a source overdensity of a factor 4 .",
    "an x - ray source excess , albeit more symmetrically distributed , was previously noted in , e.g. , the ngc507 and ngc383 group of galaxies ( kim & fabbiano 1995 ; komossa & bhringer 1999 , arp 2001 ) , and two distant galaxy clusters observed by _ chandra _ ( elvis et al .",
    "2000 , cappi et al .",
    "kim & fabbiano speculated that these sources represent cooling clumps in the halo of ngc507 .",
    "this explanation is unlikely here , because the sources are located far in the outskirts of the cluster , and the individual clumps would be exceptionally luminous ( x18 : @xmath79 erg / s ) .",
    "optical follow - up observations are required for identification of the x - ray sources and would then give clues to their origin .",

    "( 1980 ) found mr2251 - 178 to be located in the outskirts of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "they counted @xmath550 member galaxies and provided spectroscopy of the four brightest .",
    "the cluster center is located close to the brightest elliptical ( see fig .",
    "3 ) which is occasionally referred to as cd galaxy .    in x - rays , there is a striking absence of bright intracluster gas emission in contrast to what is usually seen in nearby clusters like this one ( e.g. , bhringer et al .",
    "we detect only few excess photons in the direction of the optical cluster center . if all these photons are attributed to icm emission ( instead of currently unresolved point sources ) , we derive an x - ray luminosity of @xmath80 erg / s .",
    "the weakness of the icm x - ray emission suggests , that what appears as one single cluster may just be a chance projection of several smaller clusters or groups .",
    "in fact , bergeron et al . ( 1983 ) find evidence for a second cluster at redshift @xmath81 , based on spectroscopy of one galaxy in the field of the mr2251 - 178 cluster .",

    "<S> mr2251 - 178 was the first quasar initially discovered in x - rays , and the first one found to host a warm absorber . </S>",
    "<S> the quasar turned out to be an outstanding object in many respects . </S>",
    "<S> it has a high ratio of x - ray / optical luminosity , is surrounded by the largest quasar emission - line nebula known , and is located in the outskirts of a cluster of galaxies . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present results from an analysis of the x - ray spectral , temporal , and spatial properties of this source and its environment based on deep _ rosat _ observations .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we do not detect any excess x - ray _ cold _ absorption expected to originate from the giant gas nebula surrounding mr2251 - 178 . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes the presence of a huge hi envelope around the quasar . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum of mr2251 - 178 is best fit by a warm - absorbed powerlaw with an ionization parameter @xmath0 and a column density @xmath1 which , however , can not be the same material as the giant optical emission line nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the mean ( 0.12.4)kev x - ray luminosity amounts to @xmath2 erg / s .    </S>",
    "<S> a spatial analysis shows that the bulk of the x - ray emission from the quasar is consistent with a point source , as expected in view of the powerlaw - shaped x - ray spectrum and the rapid x - ray variability we detect . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , extended emission appears at weak emission levels , including a bridge between the quasar and the cd galaxy of the cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission from the intra - cluster medium is weak or absent . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of @xmath3 erg / s , weaker than other clusters of comparable richness . </S>",
    "<S> none of the other member galaxies of the cluster to which mr2251 - 178 belongs , are detected in x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> however , east of the quasar there is a significant excess of x - ray sources , several of them without optical counterparts on the uk schmidt plates . </S>"
