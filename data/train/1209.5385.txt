    "the nucleus is a quantum object . the nuclear interaction is not strong enough to localize the nucleonic wave function ,",
    "thus , the nuclear matter stays in the liquid phase even at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this strong quantum nature in nuclei leads to a rich variety of unique phenomena .",
    "extensive studies have been made for constructing theoretical models to elucidate basic nuclear dynamics behind a variety of nuclear phenomena .",
    "simultaneously , significant efforts have been made in the microscopic foundation of those models .",
    "although there have been significant developments in the `` first - principles '' large - scale computation , starting from the bare nucleon - nucleon ( two - body & three - body ) forces , they are still limited to light nuclei with small mass numbers , typically @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the density functional theory ( dft ) is currently a leading theory for describing nuclear properties of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is capable of describing almost all nuclei , including nuclear matter , with a single universal energy density functional ( edf ) .",
    "in addition , its strict theoretical foundation is given by the basic theorem of the dft @xcite . since the nucleus is a self - bound system without an external potential , the dft theorem should be modified from its original form .",
    "this problem was addressed by recent studies @xcite . in this paper , we present basic concepts of the edf in nuclei and feasible methodologies of the time - dependent dft .",
    "in this section , basic properties of nuclei and historical developments in nuclear structure theory , which leads to the nuclear energy density functional , are briefly reviewed . to simplify the discussion here",
    ", we consider an infinite uniform nuclear matter neglecting the coulomb interaction .",
    "the volume and total binding energy of observed nuclei in nature are approximately proportional to the mass number @xmath1 . in other words , they have an approximately constant density @xmath2 @xmath3 and a constant binding energy per particle @xmath4 mev .",
    "thus , extrapolating this property to the infinite nuclear matter neglecting the coulomb interaction , the nuclear matter should have an equilibrium state with @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath5 mev , at zero pressure and zero temperature .",
    "this property are called `` saturation property '' , that is analogous to the liquid . the most famous and successful model based on this liquid picture of nuclei",
    "is the empirical mass formula of bethe and weizscker @xcite .",
    "this formula contains the surface and coulomb terms in addition to the leading term proportional to @xmath1 , which well accounts of the bulk part of the nuclear binding .",
    "there are many evidences for the fact that the mean - free path of nucleons is larger than the size of nucleus .",
    "the great success of the nuclear shell model @xcite gives such an example , in which nucleons are assumed to move independently inside an average one - body potential .",
    "the scattering experiments with incident neutrons and protons provide more quantified information on the mean - free path .",
    "in fact , the mean free path depends on the nucleon s energy , and becomes larger for lower energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that the nucleus can be primarily approximated by the independent - particle model with an average one - body potential .",
    "for the nuclear matter , this approximation leads to the degenerate fermi gas of the same number of protons and neutrons ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the observed saturation density of @xmath2 @xmath3 gives the fermi momentum , @xmath7 @xmath8 , which corresponds to the fermi energy ( the maximum kinetic energy ) , @xmath9 mev .",
    "evidences of the independent - particle motion encourage us to adopt the mean - field picture of nuclei . however , it turned out that the mean - field models can not describe the nuclear saturation property .",
    "let us explain this for the uniform nuclear matter with a constant attractive potential @xmath10 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath11 means that it is equal to the separation energy of nucleons , @xmath12 . in the fermi - gas model , it is estimated as @xmath13 since the binding energy is @xmath5 mev , the potential @xmath14 is about @xmath15 mev .",
    "it should be noted that the relatively small separation energy is the consequence of the significant cancellation between kinetic and potential energies . in the mean - field theory , the total ( binding ) energy is given by @xmath16 where we assume that the average potential results from a two - body interaction .",
    "the two kinds of expressions for @xmath11 , eqs .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) , lead to @xmath17 mev , which is different from the previously estimated value ( @xmath18 mev ) .",
    "moreover , the negative separation energy ( @xmath19 ) contradicts the fact that the nucleus is bound !    to reconcile the independent - particle motion with the saturation property of the nucleus , the nuclear average potential must be state dependent . allowing the potential @xmath20",
    "depend on the state @xmath21 , the potential @xmath14 should be replaced by that for the highest occupied orbital @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) , and by its average value @xmath23 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "then , we obtain the following relation : @xmath24 therefore , the potential @xmath22 is shallower than its average value .",
    "weisskopf suggested the momentum - dependent potential @xmath14 , which can be expressed in terms of an effective mass @xmath25 @xcite : @xmath26 actually , if the mean - field potential is non - local , it can be expressed by the momentum dependence .",
    "equation ( [ mom_dep_pot ] ) leads to the effective mass , @xmath27 . using eqs .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ v_f ] ) , and ( [ mom_dep_pot ] ) , we obtain the effective mass given by @xmath28 quantitatively , this value disagrees with the experimental data .",
    "the empirical values of the effective mass vary according to the energy of nucleons , @xmath29 , however , they are almost twice larger than the value in eq .",
    "( [ m*/m ] ) .",
    "as far as we use a normal two - body interaction , this discrepancy should be present in the mean - field calculation with any interaction , because eq . ( [ m*/m ] ) is valid in general for a saturated self - bound system .",
    "therefore , the naive mean - field models have a fundamental difficulty to describe the nuclear saturation .      to understand the origin of the problem , properties of the nuclear force provides an important key .",
    "the saturation property of nuclear density reflects a balance between attractive and repulsive contributions to nuclear binding energy .",
    "one source of such repulsive effects is the nucleonic kinetic energy of the fermi gas .",
    "however , its contribution per particle is proportional to @xmath30 , which is not strong enough to resist against the collapse caused by the attractive force between nucleons",
    ". therefore , the nucleonic interaction must contain a repulsive element .",
    "indeed , the phase - shift analysis on the nucleon - nucleon scattering at high energy ( @xmath31 mev ) reveals a short - range strong repulsive core in the nucleonic force .",
    "the radius of the repulsive core is approximately @xmath32 fm .",
    "this strong repulsive core prevents the nucleons approaching closer than the distance @xmath33 , which produces a strong two - body correlation , @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "the attractive part of the interaction has a longer range , which can be characterized by the pion s compton wave length @xmath36 , and is significantly weaker than the repulsion .",
    "thus , a naive application of the mean - field calculation fails to bind the nucleus , since the mean - field approximation can not take account of such strong two - body correlations .    at first sight , this seems inconsistent with the experimental observations . as we mentioned in sec",
    "[ sec : basic_property ] , there are many experimental evidences for the independent - particle motion in nuclei .",
    "we may intuitively understand that it is due to the fact that the nucleonic density is significantly smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the collisions by the repulsive core rarely occur and the system can be approximately described in terms of the independent - particle motion .",
    "furthermore , the effects of the pauli principle hinder the collisions , since the nucleons can not be scattered into occupied states .",
    "although the repulsive - core collisions are experienced by only a small fraction of nucleons ( @xmath38 ) , each collision carries a large amount of energy .",
    "therefore , the repulsive core provides an important contribution to the total energy and are responsible for the saturation .",
    "another important factor for the independent particle motion is the strong quantum nature due to the weakness of the attractive part of the nuclear force .",
    "the importance of the quantum nature can be measured by the magnitude of the zero - point kinetic energy compared to that of the interaction .",
    "if the attractive part of the nuclear force were much stronger than the unit of @xmath39 , the quantum effect would disappear and each nucleon would stay at the bottom of the interaction potential . then , the nucleus would crystallize at low temperature . in reality , the attraction of the nuclear force is so weak that it barely produces many - nucleon bound states at the relatively low density .      the nuclear matter theory pioneered by brueckner",
    "gives a hint for a solution for the previous difficulty to understand the nuclear saturation .",
    "the brueckner theory may provide a first step toward the quantitative treatment to understand the saturation property and the independent - particle motion in nuclei .",
    "details of the theory can be found at refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient of the brueckner theory is a two - body scattering matrix of particle 1 and 2 inside nucleus caused by the nuclear force @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the kinetic energy of particle @xmath21 , @xmath43 is the pauli - exclusion operator to restrict the intermediate states , and @xmath44 is called a starting energy that depends on energies of particle 1 and 2 .",
    "this is called @xmath45-matrix @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45-matrix renormalizes high - momentum components in the bare nuclear force and becomes an effective interaction in nuclei under the independent - pair approximation .",
    "the @xmath45-matrix reflects an underlying structure of the independent many - nucleon system through the operator @xmath43 and the starting energy @xmath44 .",
    "inevitably , the @xmath45-matrix becomes state ( structure ) dependent .",
    "since the short - range singularity is renormalized in the @xmath45-matrix , we can calculate the total energy in the independent - particle ( mean - field ) model , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) .",

    "this is called brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory .",
    "the validity of the bhf theory is measured by the wound integral @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an unperturbed two - particle wave function and @xmath51 is a correlated two - particle wave function in nucleus .",
    "@xmath52 is known to be about 15 % .",
    "the bhf calculation was successful to describe the nuclear saturation , however , could not simultaneously reproduce empirical values of @xmath11 and @xmath53 , known as a problem of the coester band @xcite .",
    "its applications to finite nuclei also have similar problems to reproduce the energy , radius , and density in the ground state .",
    "a possible solution to these problems was given by negele @xcite .",
    "starting from a realistic @xmath45-matrix , using the expressions for the pauli operator @xmath54 and the average single - particle energy @xmath55 $ ] , the local density approximation is introduced to expand the off - diagonal density matrix @xmath56 with respect to the relative coordinate @xmath57 .",
    "then , a short - range part of the @xmath45-matrix , which is not fully understood , is phenomenologically added to the energy expression to quantitatively fit the saturation property , and finally , the total energy is treated variationally .",
    "this procedure is called the density matrix expansion ( dme ) @xcite .",
    "the state dependence of the @xmath45-matrix is now replaced by the density dependence . the final result for the total energy , for a uniform nuclear matter ,",

    "thus , the dme with a microscopic g - matrix leads to a variational treatment of a simple edf of the skyrme type .",
    "the essential aspect of dme is in its non - trivial density dependence and the variational treatment .",
    "now , the expression for the total energy , eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) , should be modified due to these non - trivial density - dependent terms .",
    "this resolves the previous issue , and provides a consistent independent - particle description for the nuclear saturation . in nuclear physics , this was often interpreted as the density - dependent effective interaction . in this terminology ,",
    "the variation of the total energy with respect to the density contains re - arrangement potential , @xmath65/\\partial\\rho$ ] , which comes from the density dependence of the effective force @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "these terms turn out to be crucial to obtain the saturation condition . in summary",
    ", the failure in the mean - field description of nuclei using phenomenological effective interactions can be traced back to the missing state ( structure ) dependence .",
    "the edf approaches take into account the state dependence in terms of the non - trivial density dependence .",
    "for a quantitative description of heavy nuclei in open - shell configurations , it is necessary to include the pairing correlations .",
