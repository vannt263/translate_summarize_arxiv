    "atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma)@xcite will be the world largest millimeter-/submillimeter - wave interferometer , and currently the early science observations are ongoing , together with the commissioning and science verification ( csv ) .",
    "one of the important tasks for csv is to verify that the stabilities of the whole alma system are satisfying the specifications . within this stability verification ,",
    "verifying phase stability is one of the key missions , since the interferometric phase has the position and distribution information of the emission from target astronomical sources , and therefore critical for imaging the astronomical sources with high dynamic range and accurate positions .",
    "the alma specification for the long - term temporal phase stability is defined as follows@xcite : the total instrumental phase error , @xmath1 , should be below 35 femtosecond per baseline ( i.e. , 25 femtosecond per antenna ) that is calculated with the 2-point allan standard deviation ( hereafter 2-p asd ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is phase with a fixed averaging time , @xmath4 , of 10 second and intervals , @xmath5 , between 20 and 300 second .",
    "@xmath6 indicates the data sample time , and @xmath7 means the average over the data sample .",
    "this equation is almost the same as the definition of the temporal structure function for the phase fluctuation@xcite , except the temporal smoothing of 10 seconds , to measure the long - term characteristics with avoiding the short - term noise , such as high - frequency atmospheric / instrumental noise and thermal noise from various instruments .    in this proceeding , we show the alma system verification results of temporal phase stability . for this verification",
    ", it is crucial to eliminate all the instabilities that originate outside the alma system , and the dominant instability is that originates from water vapor in the atmosphere . to eliminate",
    "the instability caused by water vapor , alma is adopting a phase correction method using the 183 ghz water vapor radiometer ( wvr)@xcite . in this proceeding",
    ", we also provide the impact of the wvr phase correction to the alma data .",
    "to measure the long - term temporal phase stability of the whole alma system , we observed strong point sources , namely radio loud quasars , for @xmath8 minutes in the alma bands 3 ( @xmath9 ghz ) , 6 ( @xmath10 ghz ) , 7 ( @xmath11 ghz ) , and 9 ( @xmath12 ghz ) using @xmath13 twelve meter diameter antennas under various weather conditions , which are the precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) of @xmath14 mm .",

    "for the 10 second data binning , if the data points are less than 70% of the number of the data points should be , this binned data point has been discarded ( for example , assume the integration time of one data point is 1 second , and if the data points are less than 7 data points within 10 second , then this binned 10 second averaged data point has not been used ) .",
    "phase error in femtosecond has been calculated as [ rms phase in degree ] / @xmath18 / [ measurement frequency in hz ] .",
    "first , we present the effectiveness of the wvr phase correction to the measurement data sets in all the alma bands . to show this , we use spatial structure function ( structure function as a function of baseline length ; hereafter ssf ) , which is , average the rms phase in the 2-p asd of interval @xmath5 between 20 and 300 second for each baseline , and plot this as a function of baseline length .",
    "[ fig - wvrimproved ] displays some example ssf plots that improved significantly by the wvr phase correction .",
    "the improvement of the phase fluctuation can be seen from short ( @xmath19 m ) to long ( up to 200 m ) baseline lengths , with a factor of @xmath20 improvement or even more ; a factor of @xmath21 for the band 7 case in fig .",
    "[ fig - wvrimproved ] .",
    "the data that exhibit significant improvement are often taken under between normal to good weather conditions ; the examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - wvrimproved ] were taken under the pwv of @xmath22 mm .",
    "after taking out ( most of ) the atmospheric effect , it is possible to verify whether the alma system has reached to the specification or not . since ssf increases as a function of baseline length even after the phase correction , we should judge whether the alma temporal phase stability reaches the specification or not at the short baseline region .",
    "[ fig-2pasd ] displays the 2-p asd plots for bands 3 , 6 , and 7 .",
    "the shaded area is the alma specification range . in these three bands , some or most of the baselines are within the alma specification range . as mentioned above , some of the baselines that are not in the alma specification range are long baseline length data , which we think those are affected by the dry air component , so we do not need to consider here .",
    "we therefore can conclude that the alma system for bands 3 , 6 , and 7 satisfies the alma specification .",
    "all the band 9 data we took , on the other hand , did not reach the alma specification , mainly due to low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the data . in band 9 ,",
    "the number of bright sources with compact structure is extremely limited ; all the planets are too big for band 9 even with short baseline lengths , and the minor planets are generally too weak for this purpose .",
    "furthermore , weather conditions for band 9 are very severe , and a slight degrade of weather condition makes the data quality significantly worse . on the other hand , the current software only uses the data of 2 ghz bandwidth and one polarization .",
    "if the software has been revised to use full bandwidth ( 8 ghz ) with two polarization , the sensitivity increases for @xmath23 , which will increase s / n , and this will be the next important update .",
    "we deeply regret the loss of our colleague , koh - ichiro morita , who lost his life on may 7th , 2012 , at santiago , chile .",
    "he significantly helped not only this work but also for various works in the alma project , and without him , we could not achieve these results .",
    "furthermore , he taught s.m .  the basic and application of interferometry , phase correction methods , and site testings since s.m .",
    "was a graduate student at the nobeyama radio observatory , and without his guidance s.m",
    ".  could not be at the current position .",
    "morita - san , we really miss you ..."
