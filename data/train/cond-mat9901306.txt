    "reaction diffusion processes are of wide interest in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite . in physics",
    "they present a relatively simpler case of non equilibrium stochastic processes with non trivial behaviour .",
    "traditionally they have been studied via mean field type methods ( e.g. law of mass action , local chemical kinetics ) @xcite . however , in sufficiently low spatial dimension , particle density fluctuations become dominant and mean field methods become invalid @xcite .",
    "the role of fluctuations in these processes has thus been studied for a while , but has received renewed attention recently @xcite , as new exact results in one dimension @xcite and systematic renormalisation group studies have appeared @xcite .",
    "one interest of these models is their relation to phase ordering kinetics via the `` coarsening '' of domain structures evolving towards equilibrium @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "these can be seen as reaction diffusion processes for defects , for instance domain walls in one dimension or xy type vortices in two dimension , which diffuse and can annihilate or coalesce upon meeting .",
    "these coarsening processes have also been much studied recently , especially in an effort to characterize their so - called persistence ( or survival or first passage ) properties for single spins , domains or global magnetization @xcite    although many results are now available for reaction diffusion processes in homogeneous situations , comparatively little is known on their dynamics in the presence of quenched disorder , which is expected to play a role in many physical realisations .",
    "it can be introduced in the models in several ways , e.g. in the reaction rates or in the single particle diffusion .",
    "one can expect that it will strongly modify the behaviour of the system in some cases by amplifying the role of spatial density fluctuations .",
    "these effects are interesting , but difficult to study analytically because of the present lack of methods , beyond mean field approximations or perturbation theory , to treat the dynamics of such disordered systems .    even in the absence of quenched disorder",
    ", there is an apparently unlimited variety of behaviours in reaction diffusion systems .",
    "the more complex ones , such as oscillatory or chaotic behaviours , become possible for a large enough number of species @xcite . in simpler cases",
    ", attempts have been made to identify possible universality classes and a wide class of models with finite reaction rates , amenable to field theoretical treatments , has been studied @xcite .",
    "for instance , branching and annihilating random walks ( barw ) , i.e reactions such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 or @xmath15 exhibit transitions from inactive ( no particle ) to active states , which were found to be either in the universality class of directed percolation @xcite ( odd number of offsprings ) or in the so called parity conserving class ( even number of offsprings ) @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by exact results in one dimension @xcite .",
    "related types of models describe epidemy propagation , such as @xmath16 ( with rate @xmath17 ) and either @xmath18 ( recovery ) or @xmath19 ( immune ) ( rate @xmath20 ) were also studied via rg @xcite ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the effect of quenched disorder has been studied in this class of barw models , via random rates @xmath21 and @xmath22 but with limited success as the rg flows to strong coupling @xcite . as for directed percolation with disorder",
    ", it is still a largely open problem @xcite .",
    "there is a simpler class of homogeneous models without branching ( i.e without particle production ) , such as @xmath14 , @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite , etc .. which has still non trivial behaviour @xcite .",
    "one interesting phenomenon is that in low enough dimension , the process becomes diffusion limited rather than reaction limited .",
    "indeed particles in close proximity react quickly and the remaining particles are typically separated by a length related to the pure diffusion length @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to a decay of specie density , e.g. @xmath26 for @xmath27 in the case of @xmath28 , slower than the mean field prediction @xmath29 valid for @xmath30 ( for @xmath24 a related argument leads @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) @xcite .",
    "this type of results for such models in the pure case are well established from heuristic arguments , numerical simulations , perturbative rg @xcite and in some cases rigorous methods @xcite .",
    "it is now interesting to investigate how disorder will modify these behaviours . with disorder ,",
    "models in this class are easier to study than the barw type models , although it is still a difficult task .",
    "the reactions @xmath14 and @xmath33 have been studied using perturbative field theoretic rg methods for particles diffusing in random flows , either in two dimension @xcite or in a special hydrodymamic flow @xcite . as can be expected from the study of single particle diffusion in such flows @xcite",
    ", the behaviour should be qualitatively different in the case of _ potential _ disorder , which tends to segregate the particles and slow the reaction ( and the diffusion ) than for _ hydrodynamic _ flows which tend to mix the particles and increase the effective reaction rate ( and leads to hyperdiffusion ) .",
    "the competition which arises when both components are present has been studied very recently in @xmath34 in @xcite and in @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the one dimensional problem seems quite far from the reach of such perturbative rg methods and no generic result is available at present @xcite in that case , hence the interest of the present study .",
    "indeed , in @xmath36 only potential disorder can exist and is known to lead to ultraslow single particle diffusion described by a strong disorder ( i.e zero temperature ) fixed point @xcite . to make progress in @xmath36 requires developing non perturbative techniques , which is the aim of the present work .",
    "in this paper we study a broad class of reaction diffusion models where particles diffuse on a one dimensional lattice and can react or annihilate upon meeting . apart from their reactions the particles",
    "are non interacting .",
    "more specifically , each site of the lattice can be in one of several possible `` states '' , labeled @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 corresponds to the empty state with no particle present at that site . @xmath39",
    "correspond to the presence of particles of different types .",
    "when two particles ( i.e states ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 meet they react and give a another state @xmath17 with a probability @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath17 may be the empty state @xmath38 , corresponding to an annihilation .",
    "the reaction is thus a stochastic process @xmath43 characterized by a fixed transition probability matrix which satisfies @xmath44 the matrix @xmath42 can be extended to include @xmath45 by defining @xmath46 for any @xmath47 , which is the property expected for an empty state ( @xmath48 with probability 1 ) .",
    "one prominent example will be identical particles @xmath4 which react upon meeting as @xmath49 in this case there are only two states : @xmath38 corresponds to no particule present ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 to one particule present @xmath4 .",
    "the transition matrix is then @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we will obtain results for processes within the above class ( [ general ] ) and study some specific examples .",
    "we will restrict to symmetric reaction rates @xmath55 .",
    "asymmetric rates , depending on the side from which the two species come in contact , can be defined in @xmath36 and can be studied by the same methods .",
    "we will mostly consider reaction diffusion processes with only a _",
    "finite _ number of possible states ( or species ) .",
    "processes with unbounded number of states ( @xmath56 ) can also be studied by the present method , and we will give some examples . classifying the much larger variety of complex behavior possible in that case is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "other extensions include randomness in the reaction rates , which we will briefly discuss in the end .",
    "up to now we have not specified the way in which particle diffuse , nor the reaction rates .",
    "let us first concentrate on the process ( [ potts ] ) and recall the known results in the case of pure diffusion ( i.e homogeneous hopping rates ) , which has been extensively studied .",
    "it is of particular interest in one dimension since it is also a model for zero temperature domain growth in the ferromagnetic @xmath57-states potts model ( with glauber dynamics ) where @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath59 ( ising ) corresponds to walkers ( i.e domain walls ) always annihilating when they meet and @xmath60 to walkers always coagulating @xcite .",
    "it is known that the reaction rate can be chosen infinite ( immediate reaction upon meeting ) without changing the universality class , and the same will hold here in presence of disorder , hence our general choice of model ( [ general ] ) . for all @xmath61 the concentration of particles @xmath4 is known to decrease as : @xmath62 where the ( @xmath63 ) coefficient is expected to be universal ( e.g @xmath64 , @xcite ) .",
    "more detailed properties , such as persistence , have also been studied .",
    "the probability @xmath65 that no particle @xmath4 ( domain wall ) has crossed a given point @xmath66 up to time @xmath8 has been shown to decay as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the characteristic length and @xmath69 the so - called persistence exponent .",
    "@xmath65 also corresponds to the probability that a spin has never been flipped up to time @xmath8 in the potts model .",
    "the exact expression of @xmath69 was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the domain size distribution has also been computed for this process in @xcite .",
    "two new independent exponents , @xmath11 and @xmath12 were introduced and studied in @xcite to characterize the persistence ( survival ) of domains for this model , but up to now no exact result is available for these exponents .",
    "the concept of persistence properties was extended to other observables , finite temperature and studied in a variety of other models : persistence for global order parameter in @xcite , spin block persistence in @xcite , generalized persistence and large deviations in @xcite and persistence for fluctuating interfaces @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the case where the hopping rates are inhomogeneous with short range correlations , corresponding to random local bias .",
    "the generic model for this type of disorder is the sinai model where each particle performs arrhenius diffusion in the same energy landscape @xmath70 where the local random forces @xmath71 are independent random variables , of zero average ( we restrict the present analysis to zero global bias ) .",
    "various analytical results are known for the single particle sinai model @xcite .",
    "diffusion is ultraslow as @xmath72 .",
    "recently we have reexamined this model @xcite using a real space renormalization group method ( rsrg ) which yields exact results at long time . in the present paper",
    "we apply the rsrg method to study reaction diffusion of the type ( [ general ] ) for particles in a sinai landscape .",
    "some of the results have already appeared in @xcite .",
    "although we give here a detailed treatment of the reaction diffusion rsrg , we will rely on ref .",
    "@xcite for all details concerning the single particle diffusion aspects of the problem ( which we will only sketch , referring the reader to @xcite for details ) .",
    "note that we consider here only models where all particles share the same diffusion property ( i.e. see the same landscape , and have same diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "thus this does not include reaction diffusion models such as ising domain walls in a random field , for which a specific treatment is necessary and which are studied in @xcite .",
    "similarly , relations to other problems such as disordered quantum spin chains @xcite or disordered free fermion models are discussed in @xcite . in particular",
    "we have chosen to discuss our present results exclusively in terms of reaction diffusion dynamics , and not in their equivalent formulation as ( non hermitian ) 1d quantum models ( see @xcite for details of such relations in the pure case ) . finally , note that an exact rg has also been applied to the problem of coarsening of the pure 1d @xmath73 model at zero temperature for which persistence exponents have been computed @xcite .",
    "as for the single particle problem , the rsrg method allows us to compute a number of quantities , and , remarkably , even some which are not known for the corresponding pure model ( e.g. the domain persistence exponents @xmath12 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "this makes the disordered case all the more interesting to study .",
    "we find that reaction diffusion processes in a sinai landscape are strongly controlled by the ultraslow diffusion , e.g the relevant length scale is the diffusion length @xmath74 , but that they still possess non trivial reaction properties .",
    "we will characterize a broad set of universality classes , containing all reactions of type ( [ general ] ) . the reaction times ( provided they are finite )",
    "do not affect any universal quantity , so that we can consider the reactions as instantaneous for practical purpose .",
    "as discussed in @xcite there are other single particle diffusion models with short range correlated disorder in one dimension apart from sinai s model universality class , such as random barriers ( symmetric hopping rates ) or random wells .",
    "for interesting behaviour to occur , however , algebraically broad distributions are required from the start .",
    "some results for reaction diffusion processes with this type of single particle diffusion have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ rgmethod ]",
    "we detail the rsrg method , first recalling known results in the case of a single particle in [ rgsinai ] , then deriving the rsrg equation for reaction diffusion models [ rgreacdiff ] .",
    "the fixed points of this equation , and some physical properties of the corresponding asymptotic states are studied in [ fixedpoints ] and [ physical ] respectively .",
    "section [ asymptoticdynamics ] is devoted to a detailed analysis of the dynamics near attractive or repulsive fixed points and of the convergence towards the asymptotic states . throughout the paper",
    "we apply our results to the process ( [ potts ] ) but in section [ examples ] we discuss some applications to other examples of processes . in section [ persistence ]",
    "we study persistence properties .",
    "section [ conclusion ] contains the conclusion .",
    "some more technical but useful details are contained in the appendices .",
    "the model for the diffusion of a single particle in one dimension can be defined , with no loss of generality @xcite , as the arrhenius diffusion in a `` zigzag '' potential @xmath75 represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "it consists in a set of bonds , each bond ( between @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) being characterized by an energy barrier @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 ) and a length @xmath80 .",
    "the energy landscape is chosen by choosing a pair of bond variables @xmath81 , independently from bond to bond , from a distribution @xmath82 normalized to unity .    the rg procedure , which captures the long time behaviour in a given energy landscape , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) and consists in the iterative decimation of the bond with the _ smallest barrier _",
    "@xcite , say @xmath83 , and to replace the three bonds @xmath84 by a single renormalized bond with barrier @xmath85 and length @xmath86 .",
    "the new variables remain _ independent _ from bond to bond . to write the corresponding rg equation it is convenient to introduce @xmath87 as the smallest remaining barrier at a given stage of the decimation and the rescaled variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the rg equation for the probability distribution @xcite @xmath90 reads @xcite : @xmath91 and coincides with the one derived in @xcite for the closely related problem of disordered quantum spin chains .",
    "the symbol @xmath92 denotes a convolution with respect to @xmath93 only and @xmath94 with respect to both @xmath95 and @xmath93 .",
    "the probability distribution is normalized to unity as @xmath96 .",
    "the landscape is characterized by the large scale variance of the potential : @xmath97 with @xmath98 the distance from site i to site j , which is exactly preserved by the rg .",
    "thus we will set @xmath99 in the following . restoring",
    "@xmath100 simply amounts to a rescaling of lengths , and in particular @xmath100 drops out of all ( universal ) ratios of lengths that we consider later .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the rg equation ( [ rgbond ] ) leads at large @xmath87 ( using laplace transforms ) to the following fixed point @xmath101 : @xmath102 thus for large @xmath87 one finds that the average bond length @xmath103 and the number of bonds @xmath104 per unit length are @xcite , respectively : @xmath105    the renormalized landscape allows to study the dynamics of a single walker starting from a given point @xmath66 at @xmath106 .",
    "the decimation of barriers smaller than @xmath107 corresponds to the elimination of ( logarithmic ) time scales shorter than the arrhenius time @xmath8 for the particle to cross the barrier .",
    "we are choosing everywhere time units such that the ( non universal ) microscopic attempt time scale @xmath108 be set to unity ( arbitrary units can be recovered by setting @xmath109 in what follows @xcite ) .",
    "since at long time ( i.e large @xmath87 ) the renormalized landscape consists entirely of deep valleys separated by high barriers , a good approximation to the long time dynamics is to place the walker _ at the bottom _ of the renormalized valley at scale @xmath110 which contains the starting point @xmath66 , since with high probability it will be near to that point @xcite . upon proper rescaling of space and time",
    "this approximation becomes in fact _ exact _ as @xmath87 tends to @xmath111 .",
    "this defines what we will call the `` effective dynamics '' in the following and is illustrated in fig .",
    "this allows to recover the scaling @xmath112 for the single particle diffusion as well as many other exact results detailed in @xcite . since it is customary , when studying reaction diffusion processes , to compare densities of reactants with a characteristic scale of diffusion , we give here the the exact expression for the single particle r.m.s displacement , or ",
    "diffusion length  at large time : @xmath113    to study reaction diffusion processes it will be necessary to consider `` valleys '' ( two consecutive bonds sharing a common potential minimum ) . we thus slightly generalize the above rg equation ( [ rgbond ] ) to follow the distribution of renormalized valleys .",
    "the rg equation for the valley probability distribution @xmath114 at scale @xmath87 in rescaled variables @xmath115 reads @xmath116   p^{\\gamma}(\\eta_1,\\eta_2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + p^{\\gamma}(\\eta_1 , . ) * _ { \\eta_2 } p^{\\gamma}(0 , . ) +   p^{\\gamma}(.,0 ) * _ { \\eta_1 } p^{\\gamma } ( .",
    ", \\eta_2 ) \\label{rgvalley}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have omitted ( i.e integrated over ) the lengths for simplicity . the large time ( @xmath87 ) behaviour of this equation can be studied similarly .",
    "valley distributions which have the decoupled form @xmath117 where @xmath118 satisfies the bond rg equation ( [ rgbond ] ) are of course solution of the rg equation for valleys ( [ rgvalley ] ) .",
    "the subspace of such decoupled distributions ( called decoupled subspace in the following ) is thus preserved by rg .",
    "since the initial condition is uncorrelated , the rg flow defined by ( [ rgvalley ] ) remains in this decoupled subspace , and converges towards the fixed point @xmath119 .",
    "this convergence result extends to the case of small correlations between valley sides as will be discussed below .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the convergence towards the bond fixed point @xmath120 is like @xmath121 with eigenvector @xmath122 .",
    "thus the convergence towards the the valley fixed point @xmath123 within the decoupled subspace is of the form : @xmath124 and is also as @xmath121 with eigenvector @xmath125 .",
    "we now turn to diffusion reaction models of type ( [ general ] ) in one dimensional landscapes with random local biases .    from the results on the dynamics of a single particle in sinai landscape recalled in the preceding section ,",
    "it is clear that one can study most of the properties of the initial reaction diffusion problem by following its evolution under the effective dynamics .",
    "it also becomes obvious that one must now consider valleys , and the species contained in these valleys . at the decimation time scale @xmath110 in some places in the system",
    ", two valleys will merge into one and the reaction ( [ general ] ) governed by the rates matrix @xmath126 will take place .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "the errors made by this approximation are expected to become again smaller at large time , as will be discussed later on .",
    "the general method to study the process ( [ general ] ) is thus to associate to each valley the specie which it contains , which is one of several possible states @xmath17 ( @xmath38 being the empty state ) .",
    "a convenient initial model is thus one where each valley and its content is statistically independent and characterized by a probability distribution @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "it remains so under the rg .",
    "the effective dynamics is described by the rg equation :    @xmath129 \\label{rgreadiff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "the summation over @xmath17 yields back the valley rg equation ( [ rgvalley ] ) .",
    "since the average length of a valley is @xmath130 , the total concentration @xmath131 of a given specie @xmath17 ( the total number of @xmath17-particles per unit of length ) is given as : @xmath132 where : @xmath133 and @xmath104 is the number of remaining bonds ( [ scaling ] ) per unit length at scale @xmath110 .",
    "we stress that the rg equation ( [ rgreadiff ] ) is more complicated to analyze than ( [ rgvalley ] ) since it can not in general be factorized into bond distributions .    however , it turns out that there is still a simple subspace of distributions which is exactly preserved by the rg equation ( [ rgreadiff ] ) .",
    "it is the subspace of functions of the sum @xmath134 : @xmath135 where the functions @xmath136 satisfies : @xmath137 which conserved the normalization @xmath138 .",
    "this subspace plays an important role in the following .",
    "already one sees that both the fixed point @xmath139 and the leading eigenvector @xmath125 of the linearized landscape rg equation ( [ rgvalley ] ) belongs to this subspace .",
    "we now determine the fixed point solutions of the rg equation for the valley distributions ( [ rgreadiff ] ) .",
    "we already know that the sum @xmath140 converges towards the fixed point of equation ( [ rgvalley ] ) @xmath141 which describes the landscape .",
    "it is thus natural to look for fixed points of ( [ rgreadiff ] ) of the following form @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 by normalization .",
    "plugging this form into ( [ rgreadiff ] ) leads to a consistent @xmath87 independent solution if the @xmath145 satisfy the condition : @xmath146 note that any solution of this equation satisfies a priori @xmath147 or @xmath148 , as a consequence of ( [ matrixw ] ) .",
    "thus apart from the unphysical solution of ( [ eq ] ) where all @xmath145 vanish , all other solutions are automatically correctly normalized",
    ".    in general the equation ( [ eq ] ) has several solutions and thus there are several fixed points to the valley equations ( [ rgreadiff ] ) .",
    "clearly some of these fixed points are attractive and correspond to possible large time asymptotic states for the reaction diffusion process while other fixed points are repulsive .",
    "in some cases several attractive fixed points can coexist and lead to a non trivial phase diagram .    the stability of each fixed point , as well as their convergence property , will be studied in detail in the next section .",
    "here we just mention one important result .",
    "the dynamics in the vicinity of a fixed point @xmath145 is determined by the following stability matrix :    @xmath149    we denote by @xmath150 the eigenvalues of @xmath151 , and by @xmath152 the associated eigenvectors @xmath153 . for @xmath154 reacting species ( in addition to the empty state @xmath38 ) , @xmath151 is an @xmath2-dimensional matrix with non - negative elements .",
    "one eigenvalue is trivial , being simply @xmath155 of eigenvector @xmath156 ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "the other @xmath154 eigenvalues @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) , which can be complex in general , have a smaller modulus , due to the perron - froebenius theorem .",
    "we will focus in the following on simple enough processes where all @xmath157 are real , but we will also give example of more general reaction diffusion where complex eigenvalues arise ( e.g. reactions with cycles ) .",
    "let us consider here only fixed points with all @xmath157 being real .",
    "the result of the next section is that , in that case , a given fixed point if attractive is the @xmath154 eigenvalues @xmath159 for @xmath158 .",
    "it is repulsive if at least one of these @xmath160 ( and is then repulsive along the corresponding eigendirection ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the reaction - diffusion process ( [ potts ] ) , there are two solutions of ( [ eq ] ) and thus two fixed points .",
    "one is the empty state e=(@xmath161 , @xmath162 ) and the other is s=(@xmath163 , @xmath164 ) .",
    "the stability matrix associated to e is simply the @xmath165 identity matrix ( i.e. @xmath166 ) and this fixed point is thus repulsive .",
    "the matrix associated to the state s reads @xmath167 with eigenvalues @xmath155 and @xmath168 .",
    "the fixed point s is thus attractive and corresponds to the asymptotic state which represents the large time behaviour of the system .",
    "in fact the reaction - diffusion process ( [ potts ] ) possesses an interesting property : the outcome of a sequence of reactions does not depend on the order it was performed .",
    "we call these processes `` associative processes '' .",
    "they have the property that @xmath169 , i.e @xmath170 .",
    "some properties of these associative processes are detailed in appendix ( [ appassoc ] ) .",
    "we now study some physical consequences .",
    "each attractive fixed point corresponds to a possible large time behaviour of the system , i.e an asymptotic state .",
    "if there are several attractive fixed point , the one chosen by the system will depend on the initial value of the parameters ( mainly the specie concentrations ) .    from the results ( [ fixedpointeta ] ) and ( [ scaling ] ) we obtain that in an asymptotic state ( characterized by a set of @xmath171 solution of ( [ eq ] ) , the density of specie @xmath17 behaves at large time as :    @xmath172    where we have restored the microscopic attempt time scale @xmath108 @xcite",
    "note that this result ( [ density ] ) represents the leading large time contribution , subleading corrections ( which become dominant only if @xmath173 ) will be determined in the next section .",
    "interestingly , this leading behaviour is independent of the initial concentration ( provided it is in the basin of attraction of the fixed point ) .",
    "this universality property can be further characterized by computing universal amplitudes . in pure models",
    "a commonly studied amplitude is the product of specie concentration by the diffusion volume . in a disordered model",
    "one has more choices of definitions , but we will define an amplitude as in @xcite . here",
    "we find the exact result for the following _ universal amplitude _",
    "( associated to specie @xmath17 ) :    @xmath174    this gives for instance @xmath175 for the process ( [ potts ] ) , i.e @xmath176 for @xmath28 studied in @xcite by perturbative methods @xcite .    from the statistical independence of valleys in an asymptotic state , information about the spatial distribution of the species can also be obtained . for instance one can define `` domains '' , in the simplest case as intervals between particles ( i.e between non empty states @xmath177 , irrespective of their content ) we can now compute exactly the distribution of size of  domains  . from the above form of the fixed points the normalized distribution @xmath178 of domain sizes @xmath179 in an asymptotic state",
    "takes a scaling form @xmath180 which can be computed as follows .    the above rg equation for valley distributions ( [ rgreadiff ] )",
    "can be readily extended to @xmath181 which takes into account the rescaled lengths @xmath182 , @xmath183 of the two bonds of the valley , extending ( [ rgbond ] ) .",
    "the generalized fixed point ( [ fixedpointeta ] ) reads : @xmath184 where @xmath101 is the fixed point solution ( [ solu ] ) of the bond rg equation . a domain as defined above , is thus a set of consecutive empty valleys between two occupied valleys , together with one bond in each of the occupied valleys ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . since in the asymptotic state valleys are statistically independent and either empty ( @xmath38 ) with probability @xmath185 ( where @xmath186 ) or contains a particle ( @xmath177 ) with probability @xmath187 , one easily obtains the laplace transform of @xmath188 as : @xmath189 where we have used the explicit form ( [ solu ] ) for the fixed point bond distribution . formula ( [ lengths ] ) can be inverted and yields the distribution of rescaled domain sizes : @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "this can be applied , e.g. in the case of the process ( [ potts ] ) .",

    "7 of @xcite ) .    a similar detailed study of the rare events in presence of reaction processes can be performed but goes beyond the present paper . with similar arguments as in @xcite",
    "we do not expect any correction to the leading order of the quantities computed in this paper . in principle , subdominant corrections could add to the subleading terms computed above , e.g. in ( [ concentrationphi ] ) .",

    "we give here several examples of other processes , starting with a process which exhibits a dynamical phase transition and to which the general results apply directly .",
    "then we present other cases which raise interesting questions which go slightly beyond our present analysis .",
    "let us consider the system involving two species a and b and the empty state 0 :    @xmath357    the solutions of equation ( [ eq ] ) for the fixed points are the empty state @xmath358 , the a - phase @xmath359 , the b - phase @xmath360 , and the fixed point @xmath361 .",

    "as can be seen on fig [ figphistab ] , the exact convergence exponents @xmath402 , solutions of ( [ eqphi ] ) , have a negative real part , and thus the fixed point @xmath397 is also _ unstable_. this shows that the asymptotic behaviour of the system is more complex than being described by a fixed point of type ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "in fact , going back to the equations ( [ approximate ] ) of the uniform approximation , and eliminating @xmath403 , we obtain that the flow equations for the two variables @xmath404 take the `` divergence free '' form @xmath405 with @xmath406 . as a consequence ,",
    "all starting points where the three concentrations @xmath407 are non - zero , belong to closed flow lines @xmath408 of constant value of @xmath409 .",
    "thus in the uniform approximation the asymptotic behaviour is always cyclic .",
    "this however does not carry to the real dynamics , beyond the uniform approximation , since that one can check that these cycles @xmath410 are _ not _ solutions of the rg equation ( [ rgreadiff ] ) .",

    "it is interesting to study the stability of our results to an additional quenched disorder in the reaction probabilities given by the matrix @xmath126 ( i.e spatial inhomogeneities ) .",
    "we continue to consider only the rule that species react immediately when they encounter , but the analysis in fact also covers - in an effective way - the case where reaction rates are finite and with quenched disorder .",
    "we sketch in this section a possible way of applying the present rsrg procedure to this case .",
    "let us consider a model where the reaction probabilities are themselves functions of the position @xmath665 .",
    "a simple example is to allow the parameter @xmath61 to depend on @xmath666 as @xmath667 in the process ( [ potts ] ) .",
    "let us examine what happens at a decimation time scale @xmath363 .",
    "the particle in state @xmath481 in the decimated valley jumps over the barrier to a valley containing @xmath482 .",
    "since @xmath482 is typically at equilibrium at the bottom of its valley , the reaction is most likely to take place at the bottom of the valley within a @xmath424 distance of it ( since this is where all the weight of the particule @xmath482 is concentrated ) .",
    "thus as time increases , the total number of sites in the system where reactions can typically occurs decays as @xmath668 . in each renormalized valley at @xmath87 there is typically a `` finite '' number ( i.e not growing with @xmath87 ) of sites @xmath666 where reactions occur and thus a `` finite '' number of possible values @xmath669 ( a notation for the set of @xmath670 ) . for each valley",
    "these form a given set fixed in time",
    ". there are thus a priori two competing effects : the several values taken by @xmath126 in a valley result in an `` averaging '' effect for the effective @xmath126 of this valley . on the other hand the fact that this set is finite and fixed in time implies non trivial correlations between two reactions occuring at different times in the same valley .    here",
    "we will restrict to consider a toy model where we assign a single transition matrix @xmath126 to each renormalized valley with probability @xmath671 .",
    "it would be accurate in the case where in the initial distribution the @xmath126 s are correlated over distances much larger than the typical thermal width of a packet @xmath672 , but still small compared to @xmath265 .",
    "this problem can thus be treated by introducing the probability @xmath673 that a valley has rescaled barriers @xmath477 , @xmath478 and an associated rate @xmath126 .",
    "when two valley merge upon a decimation the new one simply keeps the @xmath126 of the lowest one .",
    "one notes that the statistical independence is again preserved by rg .",
    "the rg equation is simply @xmath674 \\label{rgdisorder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath675 and summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "we also note that the distribution of @xmath126 , @xmath676 is preserved by the rg rule , thus @xmath677 .",
    "thus we have a `` marginal '' problem , since in this toy model @xmath671 does not flow by rg @xcite .",
    "one can now look for fixed points of this rg equation under the form : @xmath678 where the @xmath679 must satisfy : @xmath680    in the case of the model ( [ potts ] ) with a distribution @xmath681 of @xmath61 , one can show that a solution is : @xmath682 where @xmath683 and @xmath684 are the equilibrium occupation probabilities for the problem with a uniform @xmath61 , solution of the equation @xmath685 .",
    "such a simple solution holds in that case because of the form of the matrix @xmath151 ( [ matrixm ] ) which is simply a projector onto the vector @xmath145 . in general",
    "this does not hold and one has to solve the above equation .",
    "it is then possible in principle to perform , for an arbitrary @xmath671 , the same study as the one done here , such as stability eigenvalues around the fixed point etc .. , which is left for the future .",
    "to summarize , the above result indicates that within the toy model and the effective dynamics , quenched disorder in the transition matrix @xmath669 will lead to a modification of the large time properties .",
    "these properties can be computed using the rg by assigning a an effective reaction probability matrix of each valley .",
    "they depend in a continuous way on the asymptotic distribution @xmath671 .",
    "there is thus an infinite dimensional manifold of fixed points in the rg sense , and the problem is _",
    "marginal_. like all marginal problems , it is very sensitive to corrections which may make disorder marginally irrelevant or marginally relevant ( or remain strictly marginal ) .",
    "the averaging effect may in the end make the disorder marginally irrelevant , but to decide , within the real dynamics @xcite and within a model with shorter disorder correlation length , whether disorder is actually marginally irrelevant , and how it flows , requires a more detailed study which goes beyond this work .",
    "in this paper we have studied the problem of various species of particles diffusing in presence of quenched random local bias ( sinai landscape ) and reacting upon meeting .",
    "we have shown that the real space renormalization group method ( rsrg ) , which has proved to be a powerful tool to study single particle diffusion in sinai landscape @xcite , can be extended in a simple and natural way to study a large class of reaction diffusion models . since here also the physics is controlled by infinitely broad disorder fixed points , this method , as in the single particle problem , is expected to yield the _ exact _ large time behaviour . focusing on renormalized valleys as well as on the particles ( and species )",
    "contained in these valleys , and following the evolution of their distribution by decimation upon increase of the time scale , allowed us to obtain many new exact results on this problem .",
    "we have obtained a detailed description of the asymptotic states , such as the large time decay of the density of each specie , @xmath131 , and the spatial distribution of particles .",
    "it confirms that in @xmath36 sinai landscape the reaction is subdiffusion limited .",
    "the first step was to identify simple fixed points of the valley distribution rg equation , which correspond - for a given reaction process described by a transition matrix - to possible asymptotic dynamical states .",
    "each of these states is characterized by fixed fractions @xmath171 for each specie , the physical picture being the following . at time",
    "scale @xmath110 the system consists of a set of successive renormalized valleys , which can be either empty , with probability @xmath686 or contain a particle of specie @xmath17 , with probability @xmath171 .",
    "the separation between particles grows as the characteristic length @xmath687 , and thus @xmath688 .",
    "the decay of concentration , when compared to the single particle diffusion length , leads to define universal amplitudes , which we obtained exactly .",
    "also , from the exact statistical independence of the successive valley lenghts , the distribution of interval between particles ( domains ) was derived ( and compared with some pure case results ) .    to confirm that a given fixed point is indeed an asymptotic state , actually reached by the system at large time",
    ", it is necessary to study its linear stability .",
    "we have thus obtained analytically the spectrum of stability eigenvalues around any simple fixed point , as a function of the reaction transition matrix , thereby solving the stability problem .",
    "the convergence towards these asymptotic states ( i.e the attractive rg fixed points ) was studied .",
    "the leading convergence towards these asymptotic states was found to be generically as @xmath689 with a non trivial @xmath316 , solution of a hypergeometric equation ( with in addition , an amplitude periodic in @xmath690 in the case of complex eigenvalues ) . in some cases ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath691 , the convergence is faster as a power law in time with non universal exponent depending on details of the initial model .",
    "eigenvalues corresponding to unstable fixed points , which were also determined , are of particular interest for reactions which lead to several distinct dynamical phases ( i.e several possible asymptotic states ) . the transitions between different dynamical phases being controlled by such unstable rg fixed points",
    ", we have thus obtained the corresponding critical exponents . as an example",
    ", a process with a non trivial phase diagram was studied .",
    "we have also studied persistence properties associated to a given asymptotic state . as in pure systems , where it was originally defined ,",
    "persistence can be studied for various types of patterns ( single particles , domains etc .. ) . remarkably , for the disordered models at hand we are able to derive a _ much larger _ set of exact results than exists at present for the corresponding pure systems .",
    "we have first obtained , for a generic process , the decay exponent @xmath0 for the probability of no crossing of a given point by single particle trajectories .",
    "as noted in @xcite , in a disordered system , persistence of thermal averages can be quite different from single particle persistence .",
    "thus we have also computed the probability of no crossing of a given point by thermally averaged packets , which yields the decay exponent @xmath1 .",
    "the properly generalized persistence exponents associated to @xmath2 crossings have been defined , and computed .",
    "next , we have characterized the statistics of domains , which can disappear or merge as time increases .",
    "restricting , for simplicity , to the process @xmath3 or @xmath4 with probabilities @xmath5 , we have obtained exactly the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 characterizing the survival up to time @xmath8 of a domain without any merging or with mergings respectively .",
    "we have also introduced new exponents which similarly characterize the statistics of the coalescence of particles .",
    "we have then computed them , namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 characterizing the survival up to time @xmath8 of a particle @xmath4 without any coalescence or with coalescences respectively .",
    "we have found these new exponents as solutions of hypergeometric equations . for comparison ,",
    "the only known analytical result in the pure case is for the exponent @xmath692 for the process ( [ potts ] ) .",
    "a surprising outcome was that several exact exponents of the model with disorder were found to be numerically very close , for all values of @xmath61 , to some exponents for the pure system , although they are associated to completely different diffusion length ( @xmath693 while @xmath506 ) .",
    "indeed we found that @xmath694 although they are definitely distinct , and furthermore that @xmath695 and @xmath696 where @xmath697 , @xmath698 - not known analytically - are extracted from the numerical simulation of @xcite .",
    "the agreement in relative values is better than about one percent for all @xmath61 . it may be that this observed numerical coincidence could be traced to the exact statistical independence of valley lengths in the disordered problem , while the so called `` independent interval approximation '' , gives reasonable approximation in the pure case ( but , surprisingly , poorer than the one provided by these new exponents )",
    "this however is far from an explanation and further investigation may be of interest .",
    "the effect of additional disorder in the reaction rates was also discussed . in a simple case",
    "it was found to be marginal , and thus yield non trivial modifications , continuously varying with the disorder distribution .",
    "the question of whether this result is stable to corrections resulting from the real dynamics or from disorder with shorter correlation length remains to be further investigated    although we have not considered explicitly branching barw processes , with additional creation of particles , it is clear that for at least some of them the physics should not be qualitatively too different from the one obtained here .",
    "indeed , since in sinai disorder particles are essentially confined to the bottom of large renormalized wells , as long as the process is such that particles are not created out of the vacuum and that the annihilation reactions are sufficient to maintain the number of particles small when at local equilibrium in a well , the reaction can be treated very similarly via rsrg as for the model studied here .",
    "we have thus characterized a broad set of reaction diffusion models with disorder .",
    "finally , it is worthwile to mention that we have also identified cases which clearly require a more complicated analysis going beyond the present paper .",
    "for instance we have given an example of a marginal reaction , which requires a non linear stability analysis .",
    "also , we have given an example of a cyclic reaction for which all simple rg fixed points are shown to be unstable .",
    "the question of the determination of the true asymptotic states of this reaction is thus still open .",
    "another open interesting , and maybe related , question is whether reactions with large enough number of species , which can lead to chaotic attractors in pure cases @xcite , will also lead to chaotic behaviour in presence of disorder .",
