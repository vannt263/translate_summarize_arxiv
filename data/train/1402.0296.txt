    "during last ten years , there have been numerous published research articles devoted to the precise determination of the strong form factors and coupling constants of meson vertices via qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite .",
    "qcdsr formalism have also been successfully used to study some of the `` exotic '' mesons made of quark- gluon hybrid ( @xmath0 ) , tetraquark states ( @xmath1 ) , molecular states of two ordinary mesons , glueballs and many others @xcite .",
    "coupling constants can provide a real possibility for studying the nature of the bottomed and charmed pseudoscalar and axial vector mesons .",
    "more accurate determination of these coupling constants play an important role in understanding of the final states interactions in the hadronic decays of the heavy mesons .",
    "our knowledge of the form factors in hadronic vertices is of crucial importance to estimate hadronic amplitudes when hadronic degrees of freedom are used . when all of the particles in a hadronic vertex are on mass - shell , the effective fields of the hadrons describe point - like physics .",
    "however , when at least one of the particles in the vertex is off - shell , the finite size effects of the hadrons become important .",
    "the following coupling constants have been determined by different research groups : @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3@xcite , @xmath4@xcite , @xmath5@xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7@xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15@xcite , in the framework of three point qcd sum rules .",
    "it is very important to know the precise functional form of the form factors in these vertices and even to know how this form changes when one or the other ( or both ) mesons are off - shell @xcite .    in this review ,",
    "we focus on the method of three point qcd sum rules to calculate , the strong form factors and coupling constants associated with the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 vertices , for both the bottom ( charm ) and pion states being off - shell .",
    "the three point correlation function is investigated in two phenomenological and theoretical sides . in physical or phenomenological part ,",
    "the representation is in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom which is responsible for the introduction of the form factors , decay constants and masses . in qcd or theoretical part , which consists of two ,",
    "perturbative and non - perturbative contributions ( in the present work the calculations contributing the quark - quark and quark - gluon condensate diagrams are considered as non - perturbative effects ) , we evaluate the correlation function in quark - gluon language and in terms of qcd degrees of freedom such as , quark condensate , gluon condensate , etc , by the help of the wilson operator product expansion(ope ) . equating two sides and applying the double borel transformations , with respect to the momentum of the initial and final states , to suppress the contribution of the higher states and continuum ,",
    "the strong form factors are estimated .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section ii , by introducing the sufficient correlation functions , we obtain qcd sum rules for the strong coupling constant of the considered @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 vertices . with the necessary changes in quarks",
    ", we can easily apply the same calculations to the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 vertices . in obtaining the sum rules for physical quantities ,",
    "both light quark - quark and light quark - gluon condensate diagrams are considered as non - perturbative contributions . in section iii ,",
    "the obtained sum rules for the considered strong coupling constants are numerically analysed .",
    "we will obtain the numerical values for each coupling constant when both the bottom ( charm ) and pion states are off - shell . then taking the average of the two off - shell cases",
    ", we will obtain final numerical values for each coupling constant . in this section",
    ", we also compare our results with the existing predictions of the other works .",
    "in order to evaluate the strong coupling constants , it is necessary to know the effective lagrangians of the interaction which , for the vertices @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are@xcite : @xmath25 from these lagrangians , we can extract elements associated with the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 momentum dependent vertices , that can be written in terms of the form factors : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the four momentum of the initial and final mesons and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the polarization vector of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 mesons .",
    "we study the strong coupling constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 vertices when both @xmath34 and @xmath35 $ ] can be off - shell .",

    "( [ eq22 ] - [ eq27 ] ) ) in the ope and in the phenomenological side can be written in terms of several tensor structures .",
    "we can write a sum rule to find the coefficients of each structure , leading to as many sum rules as structures . in principle",
    "all the structures should yield the same final results but , the truncation of the ope changes different structures in different ways . therefore some structures lead to sum rules which are more stable . in the simplest cases , such as in the @xmath16 vertex , we have five structures @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we have selected the @xmath49 structure . in this structure",
    "the quark condensate ( the condensate of lower dimension ) contributes in the case of bottom meson off - shell .",
    "we also did the calculations for the structure @xmath52 and the final results of both structures in predicting of @xmath49 are the same for @xmath54 and in the @xmath17 vertex , we have two structure @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "we take for the strange quark condensate @xmath84 @xcite and for the mixed quark - gluon condensate @xmath85 with @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we make the usual assumption that the contributions of higher resonances are well approximated by the perturbative expression @xmath87 with appropriate continuum thresholds @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the cutkosky s rule allows us to obtain the spectral densities of the correlation function for the lorentz structures appearing in the correlation function .",
    "the leading contribution comes from the perturbative term , shown in fig.[f1 ] . as a result",
    ", the spectral densities are obtained to the double discontinuity in eq.([eq214 ] ) for vertices that are given in appendix a.    we proceed to calculate the non - perturbative contributions in the qcd side that contain the quark - quark and quark - gluon condensate . the quark - quark and quark - gluon condensate is considered for when the light quark is a spectator @xcite , therefore only three important diagrams of dimension 3 and 5 remain from the non - perturbative part contributions when the bottom meson are off shell . these diagrams named quark - quark and quark - gluon condensate are depicted in fig.[f2 ] . for the pion off - shell , there is no quark - quark and quark - gluon condensate contribution .",
    "after some straightforward calculations and applying the double borel transformations with respect to the @xmath90 and @xmath91 as : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the borel parameters , the contribution of the quark - quark and quark - gluon condensate for the bottom meson off - shell case , are given by : @xmath95 the explicit expressions for @xmath96}^{bottom}$ ] associated with the @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 vertices are given in appendix b.

    "our numerical analysis shows that the contribution of the non - perturbative part containing the quark - quark and quark - gluon diagrams is about @xmath100 and the gluon - gluon contribution is about @xmath101 of the total and the main contribution comes from the perturbative part of the strong form factors and we can ignore gluon - gluon contribution in our calculation .",
    "the qcd sum rules for the strong form factors are obtained after performing the borel transformation with respect to the variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 on the physical ( phenomenological ) and qcd parts and equating these two representations of the correlations , we obtain the corresponding equations for the strong form factors as follows .",

    "therefore , one has to work in a region where the approximations made are supposedly acceptable and where the result depends only moderately on the borel variables . in this work",

    "the uncertainties associated with the extrapolation procedure , for each vertex is minimized by performing the calculation twice , first putting one meson and then another meson off - shell , to obtain two form factors @xmath163 and @xmath164 and equating these two functions at the respective poles .",
