    "many - body exchange - correlation effects in the inhomogeneous interacting electron system of solids , reflected by the quasiparticle @xmath2 band structure observed in the experiment , are still far from complete understanding . the standard density functional theory ( dft ) accounts for these effects only in the ground state , yielding the static properties of the solids such as the charge density or the total energy . of the dfteigenvalues @xmath3 , however , only the highest occupied one yields the correct excitation energy by a dft analogue to the koopmans theorem,@xcite while the others , strictly speaking , have no physical meaning as energy levels or excitation energies .",

    "static _ exchange - correlation potential @xmath4 used in the dft .",
    "the former is described by a complex energy- and @xmath0-dependent non - local self - energy operator @xmath5 , whose imaginary part @xmath6 describes the lifetime broadening of the excitation .",
    "whereas for materials with strong local on - site correlations the excited - state many - body effects are usually described by model hamiltonians , this approach can not be extended to weakly correlated materials with long - range charge fluctuations . only a few perturbational low - order approaches , such as the @xmath7 approximation , hedin69,hedin99,aryasetiawan98",
    "are suggested for this case .",
    "cu has since long been believed to be a prototype weakly - correlated metal for which the dft ground - state picture provides an accurate description of the excitation spectra ( see , e.g. , the review [ [ courths84 ] ] ) . only recently , based on comparison of new angle - resolved photoemission ( pe ) data obtained under full control of the 3-dimensional wavevector @xmath0 with state - of - art dft calculations , we have demonstrated that the self - energy corrections @xmath8 to the dft  in the valence band of cu display a clear @xmath0- and band dependence , reaching values as large as 0.5 ev in the _",
    "d_-bands.@xcite these results gave a serious indication for the importance of self - energy effects even in such a supposedly simple metal as cu .",
    "in fact , the previous misconception had arisen only due to errors of the early dft  calculations which accidentally matched @xmath9.@xcite our preliminary @xmath7 calculations@xcite have confirmed the general trends of the observed self - energy behavior .",
    "the most recent @xmath7 calculationsmarini02 performed within the pseudopotential framework have yielded a striking agreement with the experimental valence band of cu concerning the @xmath10- and band dependence of the @xmath9 shifts as well as their absolute values .",
    "while the self - energy effects in the valence band can be studied using pe spectroscopy , the unoccupied states still remain largely unexplored .",
    "conventional spectroscopies of the upper states using x - ray absorption or bremsstrahlung phenomena@xcite provide only @xmath0-integrated information such as the matrix element weighted density of states .",
    "the @xmath1-resolving techniques such as inverse pe still involve two electron states and suffer from uncertainties in the surface - perpendicular wavevector @xmath11 .",
    "only recently it was realized that in the energy region above the vacuum level the quasiparticle @xmath2 can be mapped under full control of the 3-dimensional @xmath0 using very - low - energy electron diffraction ( vleed ) ( see [ [ cfs],[exi],[tmdcs ] ] and references therein ) .",
    "as the pe final states are the time - reversed leed states , feibelman74 this information can then be used in pe spectroscopy to achieve 3-dimensional mapping of the valence band @xmath2.cfs , tmdcs    here , we extend the self - energy analysis to the unoccupied states in the energy region from the vacuum level up to 40 ev above the fermi level @xmath12 based on the vleed experimental data .",
    "contrary to a commonly accepted view , in this energy region the @xmath9 shifts also show a clear @xmath0- and band dependence .",
    "we support our findings by @xmath7 calculations performed within the framework of linearized muffin - tin orbitals , which include the valence and core states on equal footing .",
    "we show that the @xmath13 anomalies correlate with the spatial character of the one - electron wavefunctions @xmath14 , and endeavour to identify the essential physics of this .",
    "our results on the valence band suggest that the @xmath15 approximation underestimates the self - energy shifts due to the short - range charge fluctuations characteristic of the _ d_-bands of cu .",
    "our analysis employs the results of the recent vleed  and pe measurements performed on the cu(110 ) surface.@xcite the information about the bulk band structure , reflected in the vleed spectra , was insensitive to a slight oscillatory relaxation of this surface.@xcite this was confirmed by measurements on different surfaces@xcite as well as dynamical vleed calculations.@xcite    mapping of the unoccupied quasiparticle @xmath2 using vleed ( see [ cfs,[exi],[tmdcs ] ] and the references therein ) is based on the fact that the diffraction process is connected with @xmath16 along the brillouin zone ( bz ) direction determined by parallel momentum conservation ( external @xmath17 = internal @xmath18 ) . in particular , the extrema in the differential vleed spectrum @xmath19 of the elastic electron transmission reflect the critical points ( cps ) in the @xmath20 dispersions of the bands whose bloch wave @xmath14 efficiently couples to the incident plane wave .",
    "@xmath17 dispersion of the @xmath19 extrema , reflecting the cps with @xmath21 lying on a surface - parallel symmetry line of the bz , yields then @xmath2 along this line resolved in the 3-dimensional @xmath0 . in our case the angle - dependent vleed data with @xmath17 varying in the @xmath22 azimuth of the surface bz yielded @xmath23 along the @xmath24 line of the bulk bz.@xcite    the direct mapping of the @xmath19 extrema reflects however the cps in the quasiparticle @xmath2 _ near the surface _ , corresponding to @xmath25 excited by the vleed  beam and damped towards the crystal interior due to the finite electron lifetime , expressed by the electron absorption potential @xmath26 .",
    "such @xmath2 is smoothed in @xmath21 ( the dispersions in @xmath18 remain nevertheless unsmoothed by virtue of the surface - parallel invariance of the vleed process ) compared to the quasiparticle @xmath2 _ in the bulk_.@xcite the cps appear as the points of extremal ( inverse ) curvature of the the @xmath21 dispersions , and are intrinsically shifted from the corresponding cps in the bulk @xmath2 , recovered in the @xmath27 limit , within a few tenths of ev .",
    "to improve the accuracy of @xmath9 evaluation , based on comparison with the dft implying @xmath27 , we corrected our vleed data from the @xmath28-induced shifts using a model calculation .",
    "the model calculation employed the empirical pseudopotential method including @xmath28 . @xmath2 and @xmath14 with complex @xmath29 values",
    "were obtained by solving the schrdinger - like equation @xmath30where @xmath31 is the pseudopotential .",
    "the vleed spectra were calculated within the matching approach ( see details in [ [ exi ] ] ) . in principle , matching calculations directly on top of the dft calculations would be more straightforward , but this would require more complicated techniques such as the @xmath32 expansion.@xcite in addition to the standard matching formalism , we included the surface barrier as an additional layer with a skewed - cosine like potential and performed matching on the vacuum - barrier and barrier - crystal planes .",
    "compared to the step - like barrier , this improved the vleed spectral structure energies by @xmath33 .",
    "the shifts between the @xmath27 cps and @xmath19 extrema , found in the model calculations , were then used to correct the experimental points back to the @xmath27 limit to reflect the bulk @xmath2 .",
    "this procedure also compensated the slight shifts of the vleed spectral structures caused by the surface barrier and overlap of spectral structures .",
    "the obtained unoccupied quasiparticle @xmath2 is shown in fig.1 compared to the dft and @xmath7 calculations ( see below ) .",
    "the experimental points reveal only the bands with significant coupling to vacuum , and others are not seen .",
    "we omitted the points where strong multiple - band hybridization effects made it difficult to identify the cps on the @xmath24 line reliably .",
    "the lower @xmath34-point measured by vleed on the cu(100 ) surface@xcite is also added .    here",
    "we will also scrutinize our previous results on the valence band @xmath35 from [ [ cfs ] ] .",
    "they are perfectly consistent with the whole body of previous experimental data compiled in [ [ courths84 ] ] , but have a superior accuracy by virtue of employing a combined vleed - pe method in which vleed  was used to achieve full control of the 3-dimensional @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental @xmath2 is shown in fig.2 also compared with the calculations .",
    "the original data from [ [ cfs ] ] was processed to include only the peaks relevant to the bulk states and compensate the lifetime induced intrinsic shifts of the pe peaks notable in the bottom of the @xmath36-band ( @xmath37 ) . in principle , the accuracy of these data can be further improved by correcting for possible intrinsic shifts due to the surface and matrix element effects , but this would require demanding calculations within the one - step pe theory.@xcite",
    "our dft calculations used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)perdew96 for @xmath4 . for cu",
    "the results were however almost indistinguishable from the lda . a self - consistent full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method implemented in the _ wien97 _",
    "codewien97 was used , with the basis extended by local orbitals to reduce the linearization errors in the extended energy region of the unoccupied states .",
    "spin - orbit coupling was also included .",
    "it should be noted that nowadays all state - of - art calculations on cu agree within @xmath38 mev ( at least in the valence band ) which implies that the true dft @xmath3 is achieved on this energy scale.the @xmath9 corrections to the dft eigenvalues , given by the expectation values @xmath39 with the integration over the unit cell @xmath40 , were calculated in the framework of the @xmath7 approximation.@xcite in this approximation the self - energy is given by @xcite @xmath41 in practical calculations , the green function @xmath42 is approximated by a non - interacting one : @xmath43 in our case , @xmath44 are the lda - dft wavefunctions and eigenvalues .",
    "the screened interaction @xmath45 is given by @xmath46where the dielectric matrix @xmath47 is calculated within the random - phase approximation without employing the plasmon - pole approximation .",
    "the present @xmath7 calculations employed one - electron calculations using the lda exchange - correlation and the linearized muffin - tin orbitals - atomic sphere approximation ( lmto - asa ) method .",
    "in contrast to the pseudopotential framework , this method allows to treat exchange - correlation with the core states on the same footing as the valence states .",
    "details of the computation may be found in [ [ aryasetiawan98 ] ] .",
    "the calculated @xmath9 values were added to the flapw eigenvalues whose computational accuracy at higher energies is better .",
    "the @xmath7 calculations on cu are technically rather demanding due to the presence of the @xmath48-states .",
    "the results of the dft  and @xmath7 calculations are also shown in figs.1 and 2 .",
    "the unoccupied quasiparticle @xmath2 in fig.1 deviate from the dft results on the whole by @xmath49 . however , the upper @xmath50-band displays an anomalously large shift by as much as @xmath51 . near @xmath52",
    "the bands are shifted also very unevenly .",
    "these anomalies , missed in the previous studies,@xcite have been resolved here for the first time by virtue of the single - state and @xmath0-resolving nature of vleed .",
    "reported previously,@xcite a peculiar renormalization relative to the dft@xmath53is also observed in the valence band in fig.2 , where the shifts of the @xmath36-band ( up to @xmath54 in its bottom ) and the @xmath48-bands ( about @xmath55 ) even differ in sign . in the bottom of the @xmath48-bands the deviations become smaller , which is due to hybridization of the @xmath48- and @xmath36-bands.@xcite through the unoccupied and occupied states , the experimental shifts from the dft",
    "are thus intriguingly band- and @xmath0-dependent .",
    "the deviations can have two sources .",
    "firstly , the static @xmath4 is not known exactly , and any dft calculation has to resort to a reasonable approximation such as the gga .",
    "however , the small difference between lda and gga results and the excellent description of ground - state properties suggest that for cu this problem is insignificant .",
    "the second , therefore predominating , source is the excited - state self - energy effects due to the difference of the dynamic exchange - correlation @xmath5 from the static one @xmath4 .",
    "our comparison of the experimental quasiparticle and dft energies thus directly yields @xmath9 . the @xmath9 values in the @xmath56-point , corresponding in our experiment@xcite to @xmath57 , are given in table 1 compared to the @xmath7 calculations .",
    "inclusion of the dynamic exchange - correlation within the @xmath7 approximation are seen to vastly improve description of the experimental excitation energies . in the unoccupied states the agreement is almost ideal , in particular for the anomalous shift in upper @xmath50-band , with the only clear exception in the @xmath58 point . in the valence band",
    "the agreement is also excellent for the @xmath36-band . in the @xmath48-bands",
    "the calculation correctly reproduces the sign of the @xmath9 shifts , although underestimates their magnitude .",
    "interestingly , previous first - principles many - body calculations on cu using formalisms other than @xmath59 ( see , e.g. , [ [ zein95 ] ] ) failed to reproduce the @xmath9 behavior even qualitatively .",
    "the observed self - energy anomalies in the unoccupied bands should be taken into account in leed surface crystallography ( see , e.g. , [ [ vanhove79 ] ] ) , which so far relied on a monotonous energy dependence of @xmath9 . in our case , for example , the observed shifts of the vleed spectral structures would be interpreted as due to a surface relaxation , but they are only due to the band- and @xmath0-dependent self - energy behavior . the observed excellent relevance of the @xmath7 approximation for the unoccupied states suggests to use it in leed crystallography .",
    "although the observed self - energy behavior is well reproduced by the @xmath7 calculations , their physical mechanisms remain obscured by the heavy computational machinery .",
    "we will now endeavour to identify the possible mechanisms , at least on a qualitative level .",
    "the observed anomalies in @xmath9 can be traced back to different _ spatial localization _ ( sl ) of the one - electron bloch waves @xmath60 , i.e. the distribution of their weight within the unit cell .",
    "such a mechanism was originally suggested in [ [ nilsson83 ] ] .",
    "it assumes the local - density concept , i.e. neglects the non - locality of @xmath5 .",
    "we start with a discussion of the @xmath9 behavior in the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the dynamic exchange - correlation @xmath61 as function of momentum @xmath62 and electron density @xmath63 was calculated for this model system by hedin and lundquist.@xcite from their data we derived @xmath9 as the difference of @xmath61 to its value at the fermi wavevector @xmath64 , which , by the dft analogue to the koopmans theorem,@xcite is essentially the static @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting dependencies of @xmath9 on @xmath65 are shown in fig.3 ( left ) .",
    "the crucial parameter to determine their behavior is the electron density .    in real crystals",
    "the electron density is inhomogeneous .",
    "the electron gas plasmon dip in @xmath9 is damped ( dashed line ) by averaging over the varying local density @xmath66 and by interband transitions .",
    "most importantly , as shown in fig.3 ( right ) , the effective electron density  and consequently @xmath9  experienced by a one - electron wavefunction depends now on its spatial localization : if @xmath14 has large weight in the core region where @xmath66 is high , it will experience a large - density energy dependence of @xmath9 , characterized by a strong @xmath9 repulsion from @xmath12 . if @xmath67 expands well into the interstitial region with low @xmath66 , it will experience a small - density dependence with its smaller @xmath68  repulsion from @xmath12 .",
    "such an sl  mechanism goes beyond the usual wavefunction localization effect ( see , e.g. , [ [ jackson88 ] ] ) as not only the strength of the localization ( measured by the bandwidth ) matters but also the region of its localization .    in the valence band of cu",
    "the sl mechanism has certainly some relevance ( see also [ [ nilsson83 ] ] ) : the @xmath48-bands localized in the high - density core region experience large effective density and , reflecting the @xmath69 behavior in fig.3 , shift lower in energy , whereas the @xmath36-band with its charge spread out into the low - density interstitial region experiences small effective density and shifts in the opposite direction .",
    "a qualitative support of this picture was obtained by calculating the effective densities @xmath70 ( see [ gw - srl ] ) , which well correlate with the experimental @xmath9 values both in the @xmath48- and @xmath36-bands .",
    "exclusion of the core states from the total @xmath66 did not affect the correlation .",
    "however , the sl mechanism alone can not provide any quantitative description of the self - energy behavior mainly due to neglect of the non - locality of the @xmath71 operator .",
    "indeed , the corresponding calculation@xcite returned an unrealistic plasmon dip of @xmath9 in the unoccupied bands and , although properly reproducing the sign of the @xmath9 shifts in the valence band , severely underestimated their magnitude .    in the unoccupied states ,",
    "the sl  mechanism could not be reconciled with the experimental self - energy anomaly in the upper @xmath50-band even qualitatively unless we included into @xmath66 all core states down to the 1@xmath72 state having a binding energy of @xmath73 kev .",
    "any significant effect of such a deep level on the dynamic exchange - correlation within the local density picture seems unrealistic .",
    "this hints on an extremely non - local mechanism of interaction with the core states , as we discuss below .",
    "we will now analyze a connection between @xmath14 and the self - energy effects within the @xmath7 framework , taking into account the non - locality of the @xmath5 operator acting as @xmath74 .",
    "first , we introduce a local quantity @xmath75 comprising local contributions to @xmath9 , obtained by integrating out the non - locality of @xmath5 as @xmath76integration of @xmath75 over the unit cell with the weight @xmath77 gives the total self - energy correction @xmath78    the calculated @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81-weighted @xmath75 for the valence and unoccupied states in the @xmath56-point , obtained within the @xmath15 framework , are shown in fig.4 .",
    "we note , firstly , that the total @xmath68 is always formed by a balance between positive local @xmath82 values in the core region and negative values in the interstitial region ( which is seen better in the @xmath83 curves ) .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath80 is in fact general . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath5 is assumed to be diagonal in the lda bloch basis as @xmath84 , from the above equation we obtain @xmath85 in the core region ( small @xmath86 ) the negative @xmath4 blows up , forcing @xmath75 to become large and positive in this region .",
    "@xmath87 , determined by the particular @xmath14 , acts as a constant negative offset . in the interstitial region ( large @xmath88 )",
    "@xmath4 decreases and @xmath87 forces @xmath80 to become negative . in our case",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath5 are small , and such a pattern holds well for all states despite strong variations in the character of @xmath14 .    at first glance , the sl  mechanism seems to revive in this picture , with an amendment that the figure of merit is in fact the weight of @xmath14 in the core region rather than that in the high - density region ( these two can somewhat differ ) .",
    "indeed , if the weight of @xmath14 shifts into the core region , the positive contribution would increase and the quasiparticle level would shift higher in energy . however , this is much hampered by the @xmath87 offset , which is also sensitive to the character of @xmath14 in a highly involved manner .    in view of the limitations of the sl  mechanism , another mechanism of the observed self - energy behavior can be suggested .",
    "fig.4 shows that the valence and two unoccupied @xmath34-states are different from others in that their @xmath89 has a large @xmath90 _  _",
    "component , blowing up at the nucleus ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "these  and only these  states experience an anomalous _ positive _ @xmath9 shift on top of the general trend that the @xmath9 repulsion from @xmath12 graually increases upon going away from @xmath12 .    to extend this observation to other points in the bz , we scrutinized the flapw calculations to determine the @xmath90 projections ( partial @xmath90 charges ) of @xmath14 inside the atomic spheres , which are given by coefficients in the expansion @xmath92 .",
    "the calculated @xmath90 projections are shown in fig.5 .",
    "their comparison with the experimental results in figs.1 and 2 demonstrates that the anomalous positive @xmath68 correspond everywhere to the @xmath50-states having large @xmath90 character .",
    "moreover , in fig.6 we show the experimental @xmath9 values as a function of energy and the @xmath90 projections for the whole @xmath93 line .",
    "again , the anomalous positive @xmath9 on top of a regular energy dependence correlate everywhere with the large @xmath90 character of @xmath14 , with the only clear exception in the @xmath94-point .    the observed connection can not be explained within the above local picture , because the @xmath81-weighting cancels the contribution of @xmath82 from the nucleus region to the total @xmath9 , see fig.4 .",
    "moreover , other states such as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which have even more total weight in the high - density region than the states with the @xmath90 character , can nevertheless not experience anomalous positive @xmath9 .",
    "the observed connection can only manifest a non - local exchange - correlation effect , acting through the @xmath97 offset in the @xmath75 dependence .    in the following",
    "we propose a qualitative explanation for the above anomalous behaviour .",
    "let us focus ourselves on the states @xmath98 and @xmath34 which have almost the same correlation energy @xmath99 , as can be seen in table 2 .",
    "it implies that differences in the self - energy shifts can only be due the differences in the exchange energy @xmath100 and @xmath4 .",
    "the trend in @xmath101where @xmath102 spans the occupied states , can be understood by analyzing the character of the states .",
    "indeed , the @xmath95-state , which has a large @xmath103 character , has the smallest @xmath104 among the three states .",
    "this is because the occupied states have very little @xmath103 character , which makes the above exchange integral small .",
    "the @xmath105-state , on the other hand , has a significant @xmath106 character , which gives a large exchange with the occupied @xmath106 bands resulting in the largest @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath107-state , the anomalous one , has a large @xmath90 character but the occupied @xmath90 valence states are plane - wave like so that @xmath104 is somewhere in between those of the @xmath95-state and @xmath105-state .",
    "the trend in @xmath4 seems clear from the charge distribution of the states , with the @xmath105-state being the most localized inside the muffin - tin sphere .",
    "the physical picture arising from this qualitative analysis is that the @xmath34-state has an anomalously large shift because it has a large @xmath90 character , which makes its exchange relatively small , and at the same time its charge distribution has a large weight inside the muffin - tin sphere where the exchange - correlation potential is deep , which makes @xmath4 large .",
    "these two effects result in a large self - energy shift .",
    "we note that the amount of @xmath108 character alone is probably insufficient to make a quantitative connection to the self - energy correction .",
    "for example , the lower unoccupied @xmath107-state is less anomalous although it has a large @xmath90 character too .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that it has a significant @xmath106 character ( fig.5 ) , which increases the amount of exchange and reduces the self - energy shift .",
    "such an effect of the @xmath106 character is consistent with the negative @xmath9 shifts of the valence @xmath106 bands .",
    "moreover , our qualitative picture neglects the exchange - correlation with the core levels , while the recent @xmath7 calculations@xcite suggest that the contribution of the @xmath109 and @xmath110 levels is significant .",
    "the exchange contribution from the valence states , connected with the wavefunction character , explains therefore the self - energy anomalies on top of the sl mechanism . in the unoccupied states of cu",
    "the exchange contribution becomes critical .",
    "the recent @xmath7 calculation by marini _ et al_,@xcite performed within the pseudopotential framework , have demonstrated a good agreement with the experimental valence band of cu both on the delocalized @xmath36-band and the localized @xmath48-bands .",
    "they conluded that the @xmath7 approximation , originally proposed to describe long - range charge oscillations , well extends to the localized orbitals and short - range correlations found in cu .",
    "our @xmath7 results are somewhat different however .",
    "they also demonstrate almost ideal agreement with the experiment on the delocalized bands such as the valence @xmath36-band , but on the localized @xmath48-bands they tend to underestimate the negative @xmath9 shifts ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "interestingly , both calculations yield a wrong sign of @xmath9 in the bottom of the @xmath48-bands where they hybridize with the @xmath36-band .",
    "compared to the pseudopotential framework , our lmto - asa calculations have two fundamental advantages : 1 ) use of the true one - electron wavefunctions rather than pseudowavefunctions ; 2 ) explicit inclusion of all core states , not only the @xmath109 and @xmath110 states as in [ [ marini02 ] ] .",
    "another recent @xmath7 calculation based on the full - potential lmto @xcite also yielded small @xmath9 shifts in the @xmath48-bands .",
    "the deviations from the experiment , remaining in the @xmath48-bands , would therefore indicate certain shortcomings of the @xmath7 approximation in the description of localized orbitals and short - range correlations .",
    "however , any unambiguous conclusions on this point require further analysis , because the observed mismatch between different @xmath7 calculations is comparable with their numerical accuracy .",
    "experimental @xmath0-resolved data on the self - energy effects in the unoccupied bands of other materials is still scarce . in graphitegraphi3d we have found only a small and regular @xmath9 shift to higher energies ( 0.1 to 0.5 ev relative to the gga - dft ) which however notably increased above a distinct absorption threshold at 35 ev . a similar situation has been found in nbse@xmath111.@xcite such an increase is not surprising , because the energy dependence of @xmath112 is linked to that of @xmath113 via the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "interestingly , it was not reproduced by @xmath7 calculations . in the valence band of graphite@xcite",
    "we have identified the sl  mechanism to cause different @xmath13 shifts of the @xmath114- and @xmath115-states , having different overlap with the in - plane oriented valence electron density . in [ shirley98,[heske99 ] ] it was speculated that widening of the valence band in graphite and other non - metals could result from electron localization in high - density regions , in agreement with the sl  mechanism .",
    "excited - state self - energy effects in the unoccupied and valence band electronic structure of cu were investigated .",
    "the unoccupied quasiparticle bands in the energy region up to 40 ev above @xmath12 are for the first time mapped under full control of the 3-dimensional @xmath0 using vleed .",
    "they demonstrate , similarly to the valence bands , a significant band- and @xmath116-dependence of the @xmath9 self - energy corrections to the dft .",
    "the observed @xmath9 behavior in the unoccupied and valence bands correlates with the spatial localization of the one - electron wavefunctions in the unit cell , and with their behavior in the core region expressed by the @xmath90 and @xmath106 projections .",
    "these effects are described , correspondingly , by the spatial localization mechanism based essentially on the local - density picture , and by the non - local exchange interaction with the valence states . in the unoccupied bands of cu",
    "the latter is particularly important .",
    "our @xmath7 _  _ quasiparticle calculations performed within the lmto - asa framework yield almost ideal agreement with the experiment on the delocalized bands such as the unoccupied and valence @xmath36-bands , but on the localized @xmath48-bands they underestimate the @xmath9 shifts .",
    "this may indicate certain limitations of the @xmath7 approximation applied to the localized orbitals and short - range correlations .",
    "the observed band- and @xmath0-dependent self - energy effects in the unoccupied bands have an important implication in leed studies of the surface crystallography .",

    "<S> excited - state self - energy effects in the electronic structure of cu , a prototype weakly correlated system containing states with different degrees of localization , are investigated with emphasis on the unoccupied states up to 40 ev above the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis employs the experimental quasiparticle states mapped under full control of the 3-dimensional wavevector @xmath0 using very - low energy electron diffraction for the unoccupied states and photoemission for the occupied states . </S>",
    "<S> the self - energy corrections to the density - functional theory show a distinct band- and @xmath1-dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by quasiparticle _ gw _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations performed within the framework of linearized muffin - tin orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest however that the _ gw _ approximation may be less accurate in the localized _ d_-bands of cu with their short - range charge fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a connection of the self - energy behavior with the spatial localization of the one - electron wavefunctions in the unit cell and with their behavior in the core region . mechanisms of this connection are discussed based on the local - density picture and on the non - local exchange interaction with the valence states . </S>"
