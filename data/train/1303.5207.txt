    "cooling of instruments on a rotating system is an important technology in science experiments ; e.g. , in tests of lorentz invariance  @xcite , searches for axion  @xcite , and when using radio telescopes for astronomy and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "thus far , experiments have been performed on either a continuous rotation system with a wet cooling ( i.e. , using refrigerant liquids such as liquid helium )  @xcite or a system with periodic left ",
    "right motion through a limited angle and dry cooling ( i.e. , using cryocoolers )  @xcite .",
    "one of the greatest disadvantages of the former system is that the holding time of the refrigerant liquid limits the duration of the experiment .",
    "the use of such a system requires frequent halts to the experiment and frequent refills of the liquid .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to perform an experiment for long periods under harsh conditions ; e.g. , at high altitude where human access is limited .",
    "merits of the latter system are that it continuously maintains a cold condition for long periods of time , and it does not require frequent maintenance",
    ". however , its motion speed is limited .",
    "this sometimes reduces the experimental sensitivity .",
    "for example , the pointing motion speed of a telescope limits the scan range because of a baseline fluctuation of instruments ( @xmath1 noise ) ; its importance is described in @xcite .",
    "the combination of the merits of dry and wet coolers is a long - awaited technology .",
    "we have developed such technology that continuously maintains a cold condition on a rotating system for long periods without frequent maintenance .",
    "we are motivated to use the technology for a radio telescope observing the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe the developed system and its performance .",
    "our system continuously maintains the operation of a cryocooler on a rotating table .",
    "the layout of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview_drawing ] , and photographs are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : overview_photo ] . a cryostat that holds the cryocooler and other instruments such as a personal computer ( pc ) , temperature monitor , and vacuum gauge , are set on the rotating table .",
    "our unique design requires the development of interface components between the ground and rotating table . through a custom - made rotary joint , helium gas",
    "is transferred to the cryocooler from the compressor located on the ground .",
    "we also use a commercial rotary joint for the electricity , which is needed to operate the cryocooler and other instruments .",
    "real - time communication with the instruments from the ground is easily achieved using a recent technology : a wireless local area network ( wireless lan ) .",
    "the rotating table consists of a support structure , a base table , and an attachment table .",
    "the shape of the base table is an upside - down top hat having a larger ( smaller ) diameter of 600  mm ( 257  mm ) and height of 356  mm .",
    "the base table is mounted on the support structure via an axial and thrust bearings . a motor connected to a belt",
    "rotates the base table ; the motor has sufficient torque to rotate a mass of 500  kg at 20 revolutions per minute  ( rpm ) .",
    "a rotary encoder and a series of two rotary joints are attached to the bottom of the base table .",
    "we use a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) for encoder monitoring and motion control of the motor .",
    "the attachment table ( diameter of 1  m ) is mounted on the top side of the base table , and the cryostat and other instruments are set on it . at the center of the base and attachment tables , there is a series of large through holes , each with a diameters of 180  mm .",
    "these are access holes for the hoses and wires passing through the rotary joints .      for the circulation of helium gas ,",
    "a custom - made rotary joint was co - developed with takeda engineering co. ltd . in japan .",
    "the rotary joint has the shape of an upside - down top hat with a flange diameter of 205  mm , a body diameter of 159  mm , and height of 155  mm . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview_drawing ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : overview_photo ] , there are two gas flow paths ; a supply from and a return to the compressor located on the ground .",
    "circulation of the high - pressure gas is realized with a simple technique .",
    "the rotary joint consists of two layers : an inner top - hat - shaped part and an outer cylinder .",
    "the flange of the inner part is attached to the bottom - center position of the rotating table .",
    "therefore , the inner part rotates with the table .",
    "torque arms hold the outer cylinder , which does not rotate with the inner part .",
    "the outer cylinder has two toroidal cavities on its inside surface , and each cavity has an access port ( rc3/4  ) at the outside surface .",
    "there are o - rings between the outer cylinder and the inner top hat that seal the cavities with each other .",
    "there are two l - shaped gas lines ( diameter of 3/4  ) in the body of the inner part .",
    "two ports in the flange ( which is parallel to the cylinder axis ) are routes to the rotating table .",
    "two other ports on the opposite side always face the toroidal cavities of the outer cylinder allowing gas to flow through the two independent lines continuously .",
    "hermetic connectors ( eaton co. ltd .",
    ", aeroquip 5400 series ) are attached at the input and output ports for each path .",
    "the high - purity helium gas ( @xmath0  99.999% ) is hermetically sealed in each path when the hoses are not joined . to route the electric wires",
    ", there is an access hole ( a through hole with diameter of 30  mm ) at the center of the inner part .",
    ", width=321 ]    a leakage of gas would raise doubts about a joint .",
    "figure  [ fig : rj_leak_test ] shows the setup of a leak test .",
    "a buffer tank and the input port of the joint were connected with a copper tube .",
    "the other side ( i.e. , the output port ) of the joint was sealed with a ball valve .",
    "we filled this closed system with helium gas .",
    "the gas pressure was 2.0  mpa , which is an over - pressurized condition relative to the generic specification of the cryocooler s compressor ( 1.7  mpa ) .",
    "the inner part of the joint was rotated using a geared motor at a constant speed of 17  rpm .",
    "we found no leakage over eight days during the test ; we obtained an upper limit for the leak rate of 2  cc / day .",
    "the cryocooler and the compressor system have approximately a few hundred liters of buffer volume in general , and the gas pressure should be maintained within 2%3% of the specification .",
    "therefore , the upper limit of the leak rate indicates that operation for more than a few years is possible .      for the electricity",
    ", we use a commercial rotary joint , model-830 manufactured by mercotac inc . , which continuously maintains eight electrical paths in parallel . a liquid metal ( mercury )",
    "is used within the joint as an electrical conduction path , which is molecularly bonded to the contacts ; therefore , the electrical connection has very low noise .",
    "thus far we have used three paths to control the cryocooler ( three - phase ac  200  v ) , two paths for other instruments ( single - phase ac  100  v ) , and two paths for their grounds .",
    "output wires are routed to the instruments on the table through a series of access holes at the center of the gas joint and table .",
    "the developed system provides two innovative functions under the rotating condition ; cooling from room temperature , and maintenance of the cold condition for long - periods .",
    "temperature stability is also important in applications .",
    "these three aspects of performance are investigated .",
    "a cool - down test was performed under the condition of continuous rotation at 20  rpm . for the purpose of thermal insulation ,",
    "the cryostat was in a low - pressure ( @xmath20.01  pa ) condition in advance of the test .",
    "we use a two - stage gifford  mcmahon ( gm ) cryocooler ( sumitomo heavy industries ltd .",
    ", rdk-408s ) that has the ability to reach @xmath323  k ( in the first stage ) and @xmath37  k ( in the second stage ) without any additional thermal load .",
    "the geometry of the vacuum chamber is diameter of 318  mm and height of 800  mm .",
    "for simplicity of the test , we did not insert any additional material except for two silicon diode thermometers ( lakeshore co. ltd .",
    ", dt-670 ) , which monitor the temperatures of the two cold stages . a movie of the test is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : movie ] ( enhanced online ) .    , width=151 ]    figure  [ fig : trend_from_room_temp ] shows time trends of temperatures in the two stages .",
    "after one hour of cooling from room temperature , the system reached 21  k and 7  k in the first and second stages , respectively .",
    "these temperatures are consistent with the specifications of the cryocooler .",
    "the same temperatures were obtained without rotation of the table . we thus have confirmed the ability of our system to provide a cold condition from room temperature while maintaining rotation .    , width=294 ]      a stable temperature under the rotating condition is required .",
    "in particular , it is important to confirm that the table rotation does not produce any instability .",
    "this is done by analyzing the fourier space using the same setup as in the cool - down test .",
    "we did not find any structure associated with the rotation cycle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fft16sps ] .",
    "we also compared the spectra with and without rotation ; there were no observable differences between the spectra .",
    "we conclude that the rotation does not produce any instability above the level of the thermometer sensitivity of @xmath30.01  k , which is almost three orders of magnitude lower than the temperature vibration caused by the displacer motion of the cryocooler .    ,",

    "a compressor is located on the ground and supplies high - purity ( @xmath0  99.999% ) and high - pressure ( 1.7  mpa ) helium gas and electricity to the cryocooler .",
    "additional electricity has to be supplied to other instruments on the rotating table . the combination of two rotary joints and a series of access holes at the center of the table allows the simultaneous transfer of helium gas and electricity .",
    "while maintaining rotation of the table , we were able to cool the cryostat from room temperature to the specification temperature of the gm cryocooler .",
    "we confirmed temperature stability ; there is no temperature instability associated with the cycle of the table rotation .",
    "moreover , neither the starting nor stopping of rotation affected the cooling condition .",
