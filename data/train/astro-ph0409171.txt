    "the initial - final mass relationship connects the mass of the final products of stellar evolution for intermediate mass stars , white dwarfs ( wds ) , to their progenitor mass .",
    "it is a required input for the determination of the ages and distances of globular clusters from modeling their wd cooling sequences ( hansen et al .",
    "2004 ) , for constraining chemical evolution in galaxies , for determining supernova rates ( van den bergh & tammann 1991 ) , and for understanding feedback processes and star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , somerville & primack 1999 ) . yet , despite its fundamental importance , this relation remains poorly constrained observationally .",
    "the first attempt to map the relation was made by weidemann ( 1977 ) by comparing theoretical models ( e.g. , fusi - pecci & renzini 1976 ) of mass loss to the masses of a few wds in both the pleiades and hyades star clusters . since then",
    "most of the work has focused on using observations of wds in young open star clusters to provide empirical constraints on the relationship ( koester & reimers 1981 , 1985 , 1993 , 1996 ; reimers & koester 1982 , 1989 , 1994 ; weidemann & koester 1983 ; weidemann 1987 , jeffries 1997 ) .",
    "this effort , spanning almost two decades , is summarized in weidemann ( 2000 ) .",
    "the result is a monotonically increasing relationship based on about 20 data points , from observations of about a dozen star clusters .    a few recent studies , such as claver et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and williams et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , have been successful in finding a half dozen wds each in the praesepe and ngc 2168 clusters .",
    "the synthesis of these data with the earlier studies results in an initial - final mass relationship displaying a fair amount of scatter .",
    "for example , depending on whose data one uses , initial mass stars of 34 @xmath1 can produce wds ranging anywhere from 0.650.8 @xmath1 .",
    "this result suggests that the relationship may have a stochastic component .",
    "it is desirable to find a young , rich star cluster with a large number of wds that can be spectroscopically studied .",
    "ngc 2099 is such a cluster , with 50 wd cluster candidates measured using imaging observations ( kalirai et al .",
    "the cluster is very rich , containing over 4000 stars , and has a main - sequence turn - off of @xmath2 2.4  @xmath1 .",
    "its distance modulus is @xmath3 = 11.5 , and its reddening is @xmath4 = 0.23 . in this _",
    ", we present a new wd initial - final mass relationship based on 18 wds in ngc 2099 . in the following _ letter _ , we address the surprising result that all wds in ngc 2099 ( as well as those found in other young open clusters ) are all da spectral type ( kalirai et al . 2005 ) .",
    "imaging and spectroscopic observations of ngc 2099 were obtained with the canada - france - hawaii ( _ cfh _ ) , _ gemini north _ , and _ keck i _ telescopes . in our wide field _",
    "cfht _ imaging study ( kalirai et al .",
    "2001a ) , we found @xmath2  67 wd candidates in the central 15@xmath5 of ngc 2099 .",
    "based on comparisons between the cluster field and a blank field surrounding the cluster , we estimate the rate of field star contamination among our candidates to be @xmath2  25% ( thus yielding 50 cluster wd candidates ) .",
    "we then plotted the locations of all of these faint - blue objects on the sky and obtained further observations of 3 smaller sub - fields in the cluster .",
    "these fields were chosen to maximize the number of wd candidates ( all objects in the faint - blue end of the color - magnitude diagram [ cmd ] were treated as wd candidates ) . with _",
    "gemini _ , we imaged three 5@xmath65 @xmath7 5@xmath65 fields using the gmos multi - object imaging / spectroscopic instrument ( murowinski et al .",
    "2003 ) . with _ keck _ , we imaged the same three fields with the lris imaging / spectroscopic instrument that has a 5@xmath8 7@xmath5 field of view ( oke et al .",
    "these imaging data were not significantly deeper than the original _ cfht _ data and were only used to ensure astrometric accuracy for the spectroscopy .",
    "multi - object spectra were obtained for a single _ gemini _ field , and for two of the _ keck _ fields .",
    "the _ gemini _ observations used the b600 grating , which simultaneously covers 2760 ( centered at @xmath2 4700 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the data were binned by a factor of four in the spectral direction to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the _ keck _ observations use the 600/4000 grism ( blue side ) which simultaneously covers 2580 @xmath9 ( centered at 4590 @xmath10 ) .",
    "for the _ gemini _ field , we obtained 22 individual 1-hour exposures spread over 22 days , taken mostly at low air - masses ( @xmath11 ) and good seeing ( @xmath2 0@xmath128 ) .",
    "for the _ keck _ fields , we obtained 4 2000 s exposures in each of the two fields , also at sub - arcsecond seeing .",
    "the _ gemini _ spectroscopic data were reduced using the _ gemini _ iraf package , version 1.3 .",
    "the _ keck _ data were reduced using a set of python routines written by d. kelson ( 2004 , private communication ; kelson 2003 ) .",
    "the individual exposures were bias subtracted , flat - fielded , cleaned for cosmic rays , wavelength calibrated , sky subtracted , extracted , combined , and flux calibrated ( using bright standard stars ) within each of these programs .",
    "details of the steps involved in each of these procedures will be provided in a forthcoming paper ( j. s. kalirai et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the only major problem occurred for some of the _ keck _ field 2 spectra , which were taken at high air - masses and so the bluest flux was lost as a result of atmospheric dispersion .",
    "fortunately , two of the three stars that we were fitting from this field have also been observed in the higher s / n _ gemini _ data .    in total , we obtained spectroscopy of 24 individual wd candidates in the field of ngc 2099 ( 3 of these stars turned out not to be wds ) . therefore , despite sampling only 14% of the total cluster area , we include almost 1/3 of the total wd population ( cluster and field ) given the careful positioning of the fields .",
    "this is therefore the largest individual star cluster wd sample that has ever been spectroscopically acquired .",
    "a cmd showing the locations of the ngc 2099 wds is shown in figure [ cmd ] ( based on _ cfht _ data ) .",
    "the 18 circles represent those objects that we were able to spectroscopically fit ( see next section ) .",
    "four of these , shown as open circles , represent those objects that have inconsistent theoretical magnitudes ( from fitting the spectra ) as compared to the observed magnitudes , assuming they are cluster members .",
    "three wds , which we could not fit with models , are shown as crosses .",
    "all of the complete spectra are shown in the companion _ letter _",

    "using the techniques described in bergeron , saffer , & liebert ( 1992 ) , we determine @xmath13 and log  @xmath14 for each wd .",
    "the line profiles are first normalized using two points on the continuum on either side of each absorption line .",
    "therefore , the fit should not be affected by the flux calibration unless there is a strange `` kink '' or slope change at the location of a balmer line .",
    "the fitting of the line shapes uses the nonlinear least - squares method of levenberg - marquardt ( press et al .",
    "the @xmath15 statistic is calculated and minimized for combinations of @xmath13 and log  @xmath14 , using normalized model line profiles of all absorption lines simultaneously .",
    "the resulting 1-@xmath16 errors in @xmath13 and log  @xmath14 were tested by simulating synthetic spectra with the same number of absorption lines , and similar s / ns , and measuring the output parameters from fitting these spectra .",
    "these results are found to have errors slightly less than those in the true spectra ( as expected given the small errors in flux calibration and other defects ) , and so we use the true spectra errors . masses ( @xmath17 ) and wd cooling ages ( @xmath18 ) are found by using the updated evolutionary models of fontaine , brassard , & bergeron ( 2001 ) for thick hydrogen layers ( @xmath19 = @xmath20 = 10@xmath21 ) and helium layers of @xmath22 = 10@xmath23 . the core is assumed to be a 50/50 c / o mix . in figure [ spectrafits ] we present the model atmosphere fits for each wd .     ( bottom ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( top ) .",
    "the number of higher order lines varies depending on the spectral coverage of each star .",
    "the first six objects ( wd1  wd7 ) have the highest s / ns and were obtained using _",
    "gemini_. the remaining stars ( _ keck _ objects ) have lower s / ns but have bluer spectral coverage ( hence the fitting of higher order lines ) .",
    "the identifications are the same as those in kalirai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , in which we present the full spectrum for all wds . the corresponding @xmath13 , log  @xmath14 , and @xmath17 of these wds are given in table 1 .",
    "the masses of two additional objects are measured as discussed in the text.,width=302 ]    the wd cooling age represents the time that each of these stars has spent traversing from the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) down to its present wd luminosity .",
    "we can now calculate the progenitor main - sequence lifetime ( @xmath28 , the total lifetime of the star up to the tip of the agb ) assuming an age for the cluster . in kalirai",
    "et al . ( 2001a ) , we fitted the ngc 2099 main - sequence to solar metallicity isochrones and determined an age of 520 myr .",
    "recently , c. deliyannis et al .",
    "( 2004 , private communication ) have spectroscopically measured the cluster metallicity to be subsolar ( @xmath29 = 0.011 @xmath30 0.001 ) , and the reddening to be @xmath4 = 0.23 @xmath30 0.01 , slightly larger than the value that we used .",
    "using these parameters , the age of ngc 2099 is now calculated to be 650 myr using the same ventura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models and procedure as described in kalirai et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "we also derive similar ages using the padova group ( 620 myr - girardi et al .",

    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the @xmath28 for each star is determined by subtracting the wd cooling ages ( @xmath18 ) from the cluster age ( 650 myr ) .",
    "the initial progenitor masses ( @xmath31 ) for the wds are then calculated using the hurley , pols , & tout  ( 2000 ) models for @xmath29 = 0.01 . for this metallicity ,",
    "these models give very similar values to those derived from the ventura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models . for these masses ,",
    "a 100 myr cluster age difference would only cause a @xmath20.3 @xmath1 initial mass difference ( for 350 myr lifetimes ) .",

    ", it is interesting to note that half of our ngc 2099 cluster wds reside in a region of the initial - final mass relationship bound by the two marigo ( 2001 ) relations ( see bottom panel of figure [ fig.ifmr ] ) .",
    "this is what we would expect , given that the cluster metallicity falls between that used in the two models ( @xmath29 = 0.011 ) .",
