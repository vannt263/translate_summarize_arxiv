    "the position - dependent coupling constant strongly affects the tunneling rate of electrons through the tip and has relevant consequences in the transport spectra .",
    "in particular , we showed that conductance maps in the linear and nonlinear regime , obtained sweeping the tip along the nanotube , are closely connected to the local coupling constant and allow to localize the position and size of the vibron .",
    "effects can be more pronounced in semiconducting nanotubes due to the reduced fermi velocity which matches more closely the speed of the vibrational mode .",
    "the role of electronic interactions and of the asymmetry between tip and metal contact tunnel barriers have also been addressed .",
