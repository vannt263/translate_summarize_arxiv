    "recent efforts to achieve time - resolved imaging of chemical reactions or other structural changes with sub - femtosecond resolution possess a strong interdisciplinary character , since the goal is of interest for physics , chemistry , and biology .",
    "pioneering experiments with near - infrared ultrashort laser pulses like the ones in @xcite in which structural information about the chemically most relevant valence electrons was extracted from the emitted high - harmonic radiation or electron spectra have been of great interest , since these approaches should intrinsically have the potential for providing also the required time resolution .",
    "however , in contrast to the initial assumptions , recent experiments have demonstrated that the molecular strong - field response depends , at least for some molecules , on more than one orbital @xcite .",
    "while such multi - orbital effects clearly complicate simple imaging schemes , they can also be the source for even richer information that can be gained from such experiments .",
    "an example is the electron - hole dynamics in the laser - generated ion that may be observed by analyzing the high - harmonic radiation @xcite .",
    "though very exciting by itself , this appears to make direct imaging of the valence electrons and their field - free dynamics during , e.g. , a chemical reaction more complicated .",
    "the proposed imaging schemes based on linear - polarized ultrashort near - infrared laser pulses may roughly be divided into two categories , rescattering - based schemes and direct imaging .",
    "the first category is based on the celebrated three - step model of strong - field physics in which ( 1 ) an electronic wavepacket leaves the molecule around the local maxima of the electric field by tunneling ionization , ( 2 ) this wavepacket is accelerated in the laser field and reverses its direction as the field direction changes , and ( 3 ) the electronic wavepacket may recollide with its parent ion . as a consequence of this recollision , the electronic wavepacket may partly scatter elastically ( diffraction ) or inelastically ( leading to excitation or further fragmentation ) , or recombine by the emission of high - harmonic radiation",
    "clearly , all these processes should depend on the structure of the molecular ion and thus have the potential for revealing structural information .",
    "this includes both electronic structure as well as nuclear geometry .",
    "corresponding reviews may be found in @xcite .",
    "while the rescattering - based imaging schemes are evidently based on the third step of the three - step model and consequently require that this model is at least a good approximation , the direct imaging schemes are based on the first , the ionization step . measuring the ion yield as a function of the time - delay between two very short pulses has been demonstrated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite to induce and image vibrational motion in the electronic ground state of neutral molecules .",
    "simplified models like the strong - field approximation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation suggest also the possibility to image the nuclear geometry of a molecule by comparing the energy - resolved electron spectra for different molecular orientations , but were immediately shown to fail using a full - dimensional ab initio treatment for h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an alternative , rather straightforward approach to time - resolved direct imaging with intense near - infrared laser pulses is based on recording the dependence of the total ionization probability as a function of the relative orientation of the polarization axis of a linear polarized laser pulse with respect to the molecule .",
    "since this corresponds to the fully integrated electron ( or ion ) spectrum , it is by far the most intense response signal , many orders of magnitude larger than recollision signals .",
    "this makes it experimentally very attractive . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the alignment - dependent ionization probability reflects the shape of the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) for both n@xmath0 and o@xmath0 . however , the therein also considered example of co@xmath0 turned out to be not as straightforward .",
    "a possible reason could be a coherent core trapping of the valence electron @xcite which explains that only at lower intensity the imaging appears to work for co@xmath0 , in agreement with an experiment performed with lower laser intensity @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be reminded that time - resolution is achieved in direct imaging schemes using pump - probe arrangements .",
    "typically , the dynamics has anyhow to be triggered in some way .",
    "this may be achieved by two identical , time shifted laser pulses as in @xcite or by synchronizing another pump laser to the probe pulse . on the other hand ,",
    "especially the high - harmonic based recollision imaging schemes possess an intrinsic time resolution that is , however , limited in total duration to about half a laser cycle and thus to about 1.6fs for 800 nm laser light @xcite . to follow dynamics on longer time scales , lasers with longer wavelengths have to be used , or a pump - probe scheme has to be applied as in the direct imaging schemes .",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic time resolution can only be used for processes that are induced in the ionizing first step and thus not really adequate for the general purpose of imaging chemical reactions .    in order to image chemical reactions ,",
    "it is , of course , important that concepts tested so far for linear molecules are also applicable to more general molecules .",
    "we have thus decided to investigate the direct imaging proposal based on the recording of the orientation - dependent ionization yield for a simple but very important non - linear molecule : water . despite its natural importance due to its abundance in nature",
    ", there are some additional arguments for choosing this molecule in the present context .",
    "the three energetically highest - lying orbitals of h@xmath0o are known to very roughly correspond to the three p orbitals of the oxygen atom that are , however , differently modified by the oh bonds .",
    "all three orbitals are thus structurally relatively simple and a good test candidate for imaging schemes .",
    "for example , the energetically highest - lying occupied orbital , the @xmath1 homo , is almost identical to an oxygen p orbital .",
    "in contrast to true atomic p orbitals , the two hydrogen atoms in water lead , however , to a break of the isotropic symmetry and a deformation , especially of the so called @xmath2 . furthermore , due to the symmetry reduction the three oxygen p orbitals loose their degeneracy and thus become ( also energetically ) distinguishable . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to test the sensitivity of an imaging scheme .",
    "note , it has to be mentioned that the field - free alignment of a dipolar molecule like h@xmath0o is experimentally a challenging task .",
    "however , orientation - resolved information for one - photon ionization was obtained in @xcite , but from a multiple coincidence measurement that allowed to reconstruct the orientation at the incident of ionization .",
    "other approaches that avoid pre - alignment of the molecule are based on the use of circular polarized laser pulses as was applied to h@xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "clearly , in this case the theoretical description should consider circular and not linear polarization . due to the increased numerical demands ,",
    "this is , however , so far seldom the case ( see , e.g. , the theoretical analysis of the just mentioned h@xmath0 experiment in @xcite ) .",
    "ionization and harmonic generation of water molecules in intense fields have recently stirred some interest and were investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the case of relatively low intensities with supposedly negligible ionization was studied using time - dependent configuration interaction ( restricted to single and double excitations ) in @xcite where polarizabilities and low harmonics were reported .",
    "ionization of the homo of h@xmath0o in electric half - cycle pulses was studied in @xcite within a hydrogenic - orbital approximation and thus an atomic model . adopting a numerical implementation of time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) based on voronoi cells the ionization of water molecules in intense laser fields",
    "was studied in @xcite . in that implementation",
    "only next - neighbor - cell interactions were considered and thus approximate td - dft results were obtained .",
    "this approximate td - dft approach is in the following named tdvfd as in @xcite .",
    "considering two 2-dimensional cuts it was found that within the tdvfd approach the overall ionization is dominated by ionization from the homo , but at specific directions the contribution can locally exceed the one from the homo . in @xcite the ionization from the homo of water was calculated within the molecular ammosov - delone - krainov ( mo - adk ) approximation . at least along the considered two - dimensional cut the dependence of the ionization rate on the relative orientation between laser field and molecular plane as obtained by the mo - adk model was shown to agree qualitatively , though not quantitatively , with the tdvfd results in @xcite .",
    "the high - harmonic radiation of water molecules was recently investigated experimentally @xcite and theoretically within a variant of the strong - field approximation in which the recombination dipole matrix element is related to single - photon ionization cross - sections @xcite .",
    "already earlier , a theoretical investigation within the strong - field approximation was reported in @xcite . in accordance with the in @xcite predicted overall dominance of the homo ionization ( first step of the three - step model ) , the theoretical investigation of isotope effects on the high - harmonic generation of water was restricted to the homo in @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that practically no isotope effect is present and thus no nuclear motion is visible from the high - harmonic radiation , if the ratio of the high - harmonic spectra from h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o is analyzed .",
    "the reason is the absence of ( substantial ) excitation of vibrational motion , if ionization from the water homo is considered .",
    "this is due to the fact that the potential surfaces of the neutral water molecule and the formed ion ( in its electronic ground state ) are very similar .",
    "the time - resolved imaging of nuclear motion using high - harmonics requires on the other hand vibrational excitation and thus different potential surfaces of the neutral and the ion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a recent mixed experimental and theoretical study @xcite has shown a pronounced isotope effect in water harmonics .",
    "it is explained by high - harmonic generation from the which , in contrast to the one from the homo , is accompanied by substantial vibrational excitation . as it becomes clear from the present study , the good visibility of the high - harmonic radiation from the ( relative to the one from the homo )",
    "is , within the terminology of the three - step model , also due to the second and third step , while ionization ( in an isotropic ensemble ) occurs dominantly from the homo , at least for not too high intensities .",
    "the main goal of the present work is , however , to provide quantitative predictions of the full three - dimensionally resolved dependence of the ionization yield of a water molecule on the relative orientation of the molecule with respect to the laser field axis . based on these results",
    "the prospects of direct ( time - resolved ) imaging of orbital densities by recording the orientation or alignment dependent ionization probabilities are discussed .",
    "the full _ ab initio _ treatment of the time - dependent response of molecules exposed to intense near - infrared laser fields is a non - trivial task .",
    "in fact , only very recently it has become possible to treat the two electrons of the simplest stable molecule , h@xmath0 , exposed to intense ultrashort laser pulses ( with 800 nm wavelength ) for arbitrary orientations in full dimensionality @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have implemented a method that solves the time - dependent schrdinger equation for in principle arbitrary molecules within the single - active - electron ( sae ) approximation .",
    "the method was introduced in @xcite where also the validity of the sae approximation was demonstrated for h@xmath0 .",
    "the extension to linear molecules with more than two electrons ( n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , and co@xmath0 ) followed in @xcite . as it turned out , the standard frozen - core approximation is neither gauge invariant nor does it preserve the pauli principle during the pulse , but it is possible to formulate a single - slater - determinant approximation that does @xcite . in the present work , almost all results were obtained with the latter approximation ( named method b in @xcite ) . since details of the approach can be found elsewhere @xcite , it is only briefly described with an emphasis on the present implementation for general , non - linear molecules .",
    "( color online ) sketch ( not to scale ) of the spheres defining the local basis sets for h@xmath0o .",
    "the origin is chosen to coincide with the oxygen atom ( blue ) , while the two h atoms ( red ) and thus the molecule lie in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "two small spheres are centered around the hydrogen atoms , while one large sphere ( with radius @xmath4 ) defines the main basis and discretization volume .",
    "the bold green arrow along the positive @xmath5-axis indicates the direction of the permanent dipole moment of water .",
    ", scaledwidth=25.0% ]    from the theoretical viewpoint the description of the ionization of non - linear molecules is challenging for two reasons .",
    "first , a proper description of the molecule has to account for its full multi - center character .",
    "second , non - linear molecules belong to symmetry groups with no infinite symmetry element .",
    "therefore , the use of symmetry does not lead to a dramatic reduction of the numerical efforts , since the hamiltonian consists of a finite number of blocks and is by far not as sparse as for non - abelian symmetries .",
    "the degree of sparseness determines on the other hand the efficiency of the time propagation . in the case of h@xmath0o with @xmath6 symmetry",
    "there are only four irreducible representations : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in view of this , compared to linear molecules , small reduction of the computational efforts it is evident that the present study demonstrates the ability of our recently developed approach @xcite to treat arbitrary molecules , because for the worst case , molecules with no symmetry ( @xmath11 ) , the number of irreducible representations is only reduced from four to one .    in the first step of the calculation field - free kohn - sham orbitals",
    "are obtained using the lb94 exchange - correlation potential which has the correct asymptotic behavior @xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals are described by a multi - centered @xmath12-spline basis @xcite .",
    "this basis is composed of a set of ( typically atom - centered ) spheres in which a local basis is defined as the product of spherical harmonics and a radial part expressed in @xmath12 splines .",
    "these spheres must ( presently ) not overlap .",
    "an arbitrary number of such spheres centered at any position of 3d space is allowed .",
    "molecular symmetry is accounted for by generating symmetry - adapted basis sets .",
    "a large central sphere that is usually positioned at the charge center of the molecule is added that defines an additional large @xmath12-spline basis .",
    "it overlaps with all atomic - centered spheres and provides an improved description of the chemical bonding and , especially , the molecular electronic continuum .",
    "the latter is obtained in a discretized form , the density of the discretized continuum being determined by the size of the central sphere .",
    "the concept is sketched for the present example of h@xmath0o in fig .  [",
    "fig : dft_sketch ] .",
    "since the charge center lies very close to the oxygen nucleus , no local basis is defined for the latter , but the center of the large sphere coincides with the oxygen nucleus and not with the charge center .",
    "it should be emphasized that the adopted multi - center basis is well suited to treat the atomic coulomb singularities and the atomic cores of a molecule .",
    "for example , in the frozen - core sae approach in @xcite a fitted core potential had to be smoothened ( by hand ) in order to prevent numerical instabilities arising from the coulomb singularities . furthermore ,",
    "much higher angular momenta are required for describing a multi - center molecule in a single - center basis .",

    "the time - dependent wavefunction is expressed as a single slater determinant ; the initial state being the ground - state kohn - sham slater determinant .",
    "the one - electron wavefunctions that form the time - dependent slater determinant are expanded in the basis of the occupied and virtual kohn - sham orbitals of the field - free kohn - sham molecular hamiltonian .",
    "thus the kohn - sham orbitals form a convenient basis , but in principle any other complete single - particle basis could be used , like , e.g. , the hartree - fock basis additionally used in @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the orbitals are propagated in the ( frozen ) ground - state hamiltonian plus the external field . as is shown in @xcite , the time - propagation of the slater determinant",

    "the ionization yields ( middle column ) and excitation yields ( right column ) are normalized with respect to the maxima , i.e.  the maximum yield in each plot is one . in agreement with the shapes of the orbitals",
    "the ionization yields show approximately p - orbital like structures that point along the directions of maximal extension of the orbitals .",

    "[ fig : homo-2_xyz ] in which the absolute values of the ionization yield as a function of the orientation of the molecule with respect to the field axis is shown . however , the distortion is opposite to the one of the orbital , since it points toward the negative @xmath5 axis , while the hydrogen atoms point toward positive @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , one would not expect any asymmetry of this kind in in the strong - field response to a linear polarized laser field , since the electric field vector points periodically `` up '' and `` down '' .",
    "therefore , the total ionization probability should be inversion symmetric .",
    "the found asymmetry is a consequence of the shortness of the adopted laser pulse , though 8 cycles is not ultrashort . as a check , a calculation with a different carrier envelope phase @xmath39 ( instead of 0 )",

    "the strong phase dependence found here even for a pulse as long as 8 cycles is very likely to be a consequence of the strong dipole moment of ( oriented ) water molecules .",
    "thus , a very pronounced carrier envelope effect should occur for even shorter laser pulses .",
    "since the dipole vector of the molecule is oriented along the @xmath5 direction and the orbital density possesses mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath40 and @xmath3 planes , the asymmetry occurs in the @xmath3 , but not in the @xmath37 plane .",
    "while the strong phase effect is interesting by itself and provides in sufficiently short pulses even information on the absolute orientation of a molecule and not only its orientation , it is problematic from the viewpoint of orbital imaging . in the case of the of water",
    "it could appear as the correct image is obtained , but the `` image '' depends on pulse length and carrier envelope phase . recall that in @xcite the asymmetry was measured for hcl molecules using 50fs pulses ( and circular polarized light ) , but this required the coincident detection of ions in order to restore the molecular - frame information .",
    "based on a simplified tunneling model , the found asymmetry was attributed to the dipole moment and not to the orbital shape .",
    "since a permanent or induced dipole moment influences the orientation - dependent ionization yield , this effect has to be corrected for , if orbital ( densities ) should be imaged .",
    "the size and importance of this correction increases with decreasing pulse length and thus , if a better time resolution should be obtained , by employing shorter pulses .",

    "correspondingly , the mirror image ( with respect to the @xmath37 plane ) is obtained for a phase @xmath39 and the asymmetry disappears for long pulses .",
    "interestingly , a second asymmetry is observed when comparing the cuts through the @xmath3 and @xmath40 planes , shown on the absolute scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : homo-1_xyz ] . the lobes in the @xmath3 plane",
    "are found to be substantially broader than the ones in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "since the discussed difference in the widths is perpendicular to the dipole moment ( and shows the proper mirror symmetry ) , it is clearly a consequence of the shape of the orbital . in agreement with the orbital shape ,",
    "the ion yield in the @xmath3 plane is broader than in the @xmath40 plane , since the orbital density of the is stretched in direction of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "however , for a sufficiently long pulse or an experiment with no control over the carrier envelope phase inversion symmetry is automatically enforced and thus the widths of the lobes pointing in positive or negative @xmath5 direction will be equal in such a case .",
    "the different width is thus only a consequence of the upper lobe ( pointing toward @xmath41 ) of the orbital in fig .",
    "[ fig : homo-1_xyz ] , while the lower lobe ( @xmath42 ) dilutes the effect , since it is rotationally symmetric .",

    "low momenta correspond , however , to the electrons far away from the nuclei , ie .  to the asymptotic part of the position - space orbital",

    "integrated over all directions ionization is dominated by the one from the homo ( note the logarithmic scale ) . a dominant ionization from the in the @xmath3 plane had been predicted in @xcite based on a tdvfd calculation . a direct comparison ( with identical 20 cycle pulses with peak intensity ) is shown in fig .  [ fig : compare_son ] .",
    "qualitatively , the results are very similar , though the present ones tend to be broader , i.e.  minima and maxima are slightly less pronounced . on the absolute scale ,",
    "the results differ by factors in between 1.7 and 10 .",

    "all ionization yields from the sae - tdse calculation were multiplied by a factor 2 .",
    "the inset shows the ratio of the homo ionized along the @xmath23-direction ( red filled circles ) and the ionized along the @xmath5-direction ( blue filled diamonds ) together with an adk estimate of the ratio .",
    "the arrows indicate the intensity used in most other graphs , especially in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_plot ] . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is also interesting to consider the intensity dependence of the relative ionization yields of the homo and the shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization ] . for low intensities , the maximum",
    "ionization occurs along the direction of the homo ( @xmath23 axis ) , followed by the one of the along its maximum extension ( @xmath5 axis ) .",
    "the ionization of the homo along the @xmath22 and @xmath5 directions is practically identical and , for not too high intensities , agrees also to the one of the along the @xmath23 direction .",
    "the lowest probability is found for the along the @xmath22 direction , due to the absence of the resonant structure observed in @xmath23 direction and discussed above . comparing the ionization probabilities of the homo and the along the directions of maximum ionization ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization ] ) one finds a pronounced intensity dependence . clearly , at high intensities the ratio approaches 1 , since the homo ionization saturates earlier than the one of the . in a comparison to experiment",
    ", saturation requires to consider also focal volume effects .",
    "furthermore , the transition from a factor 2 to 1 due to saturation of the single - electron ionization should differ for homo and , if it follows the earlier findings for h@xmath0 where a rather sharp transition between factors 1 and 2 for about 10@xmath60 ionization probability was found .    in a recent experiment the high - harmonic spectra of h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o",
    "have been measured . in the analysis based on a calculation using the present theoretical approach",
    "it was concluded that the harmonics for the different isotopes differ significantly , because ionization from the excites a vibrational wavepacket , while homo ionization does not @xcite . in view of the present",
    "finding it is clear that the observability of the high harmonics in an isotropic sample requires that the lower ionization probability is partially compensated for by the higher recombination rate ( 3rd step of the three - step model ) .",
    "furthermore , as is also seen from the present results , saturation plays an important role for higher intensities , since the ratio of the maxima of the ionization yields from the homo and the approaches 1 for high intensities ( cf .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization ] ) .",
    "an estimate of this ratio with adk ( including the saturation effect ) is also shown .",
    "clearly , adk overestimates the ratio significantly for lower intensities and reaches the ratio 1 due to saturation very abruptly . concerning the direct imaging scheme discussed above",
    ", the intensity dependence of the ratio is important , since the image of the homo density may be distorted by an admixture of lower lying orbitals and this admixture changes with intensity .",
    "while this is very critical for a measurement at a single intensity , the intensity dependence of the ratio can , on the other hand , also help to disentangle the contributions from different orbitals .",
    "in conclusion , the response of water molecules to ultrashort intense laser pulses ( at 800 nm ) was investigated by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation within a single - active - electron approximation , but taking into account a complete multicenter molecular core .",
    "in fact , the influence of the laser field on all electrons was considered , but the electron - electron interaction is restricted to a single - determinant approximation .",
    "it was found that the orientation - dependent ionization from the three energetically highest occupied orbitals reflects their overall shape .",
    "however , for a sufficiently long pulse the image acquires inversion symmetry , since the electric field vector points approximately symmetrically up and down . for short pulses , in the present case even as long as 8 cycles , deviations from the inversion symmetry of the ionization distribution were found . although it may be a consequence of the asymmetric shape of the orbital , the visibility of this effect even for such relatively long pulses suggests that it is mainly due to the permanent dipole moment of an ( oriented ) water molecule .",
    "while this effect provides additional information , it distorts the image of the orbitals and it depends evidently on the absolute phase and time duration of the laser pulse . on the other hand ,",
    "the missing rotational symmetry of water compared to the previously mainly discussed linear molecules allowed a distinction of broad and narrow features of the orbitals , provided they survive the enforced inversion symmetry .",
