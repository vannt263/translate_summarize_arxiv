    "in many applications , one wishes to infer properties of a material or a process in an interior region of a sample not readily accessible to experimental probes .",
    "examples of such inverse problems involving boundary data include radiological imaging , where radiation passing through tissues is detected outside the sample , electrical impedance tomography , where potentials are measured on the exterior of a body , and seismology , where reflected waves are measured at the earth s surface .",
    "such problems are often ill - conditioned : there may be several different interior structures that yield nearly the same measured boundary data .",
    "one type of `` boundary '' data that often arises in stochastic models is a first passage time distribution ( fptd ) , describing the probability of a random variable first reaching a particular value within a certain time window . here , the boundary data is the probability flux out of the domain .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows individual trajectories of a one - dimensional stochastic process and their corresponding first passage times .",
    "the fptd is shown in figure [ fig1](b ) along with its laplace transform in the inset .",
    "these types of first passage problems arise in many biophysical contexts .",
    "for example , the voltage across a nerve cell membrane fluctuates due to noisy inputs from other neurons , and can be described by a biased random walk determined by a constitutive voltage - current relationship intrinsic to the cell ( tuckwell _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) when the fluctuating voltage exceeds a threshold , the potential rapidly spikes before resetting .",
    "the interspike times define the first passage times of the fluctuating voltage from which one might wish to reconstruct the neuron s inherent current - voltage relationship .",
    "stochastic inverse problems are typically ill - posed : there may be several different interior structures that could yield identical or nearly identical measured boundary data .",
    "nonetheless , for many physical systems , reconstruction of constitutive relations from measured data can be cast in sturm - liouville form with an unknown spatially dependent coefficient ( levitan 1987 , mclaughlin 1986 ) given the eigenvalues of the problem and assuming a symmetric coefficient function , its full reconstruction is unique ( borg 1946 ) .",
    "however , one eigenvalue spectrum is insufficient to determine a general nonsymmetric coefficient ( borg 1946 ) . for stochastic problems",
    ", the spectrum of the corresponding sturm - liouville problem can not be readily extracted from data and algorithms developed specifically for reconstruction through the eigenvalues ( brown _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 , rundell & sacks 1992@xmath0 , rundell & sacks 1992@xmath1 ) are of limited use in our stochastic problem .",
    "this motivates the development of new algorithms and techniques that deal directly with the boundary data .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a stochastic inverse problem in the context of another system commonly encountered in biophysics : macromolecule unfolding and molecular adhesion bond rupturing .",
    "macromolecular bond displacements are often described by a single bond coordinate , represented by a fluctuating brownian `` particle '' in a one - dimensional energy landscape .",
    "the metastable bond is considered to be broken the instant the bond coordinate reaches a critical extension .",
    "this problem is of great interest in single - molecule biophysics , particularly in the context of dynamic force spectroscopy ( dfs ) ( evans _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . in dfs ,",
    "a pulling force protocol is applied to the bond and the force at the instant of rupture is recorded",
    ". the mean rupture force by itself would give very little information about the molecular potential ( schlierf & rief 2006 ) since many different potentials would yield the same mean rupture force .",
    "how much of the bond potential can be recovered from the measured rupture force _ distribution _ ?",
    "all of the recent theoretical treatments of this problem have either analysed the forward problem ( heymann & grbmuller 2000 ) , used physical approximations to derive simple force - dependent and time - dependent dissociation rates ( bell 1978 , walton _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ) , and/or considered simple 2 - 3 parameter single minimum potentials ( hummer & szabo 2003 , dudko _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 , freund 2009 ) .",
    "the rate of force increase as a function of displacement ( the rupture stiffness ) has also been incorporated into a procedure to fit basic parameters of simple potentials ( fuhrmann _ et al . _ 2008 ) .",
    "however , by imposing such simple two or three parameter forms for the reconstructed potential , one loses details such as multiple minima .    here , we approach the inverse problem by allowing a wider class of potentials , including those with multiple minima . within a class of potentials , we numerically determine the ones that best fit the entire measured fptd .",
    "although the difficulty of extracting eigenvalues from fptd data is avoided , the inverse problem remains intrinsically ill - conditioned and it is not surprising that almost all studies have focused on reconstructing only two or three attributes of the stochastic process , typically , the energy barrier height and width . in  2 , we formulate the problem through the backward equation of a brownian process with a potential energy - derived drift . in  3 , we decompose the drift function into basis functions and develop an iterative optimization procedure to find the coefficients of these basis functions . in  4 ,",
    "we show that using a single fptd restricts the type of potentials we can reconstruct .",
    "we also show how the inverse problem can be optimized by tuning the amplitude of the unknown potential and the initial bond displacement .",
    "another key finding is that multiple fptds greatly facilitate the reconstruction , allowing us to accurately determine potentials with multiple minima .",
    "we propose experimental protocols that can be used to generate these additional fptds . finally in  5",
    ", we discuss limitations of our method and possible refinements .",
    "the general problem of stochastic bond rupturing is geometrically complex , particularly when considering deformations associated with large macromolecules carrying many degrees of freedom .",
    "although in principle these systems can be modeled by stochastic processes in higher dimensions , for simplicity , and we restrict our mathematical analysis to a one - dimensional brownian motion described by a diffusivity @xmath2 and a convective drift @xmath3 proportional to the force derived from a time - independent molecular bond potential @xmath4 , and to the mobility @xmath5 . although we restrict ourselves to time - independent potentials , corresponding to static forces , the rupture force distribution can be transformed into a first rupture time distribution ( fptd ) in the quasi - adiabatic limit ( dudko _ et al .",
