    "a two - qubit maximally entangled state ( mes ) of a two - state system can be written as@xcite , @xmath3 where the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 are normalized to unity @xmath6 it is seen that a mes is defined by a pair of complex numbers @xmath7 . to visualize a mes , @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "can be parameterized to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a unit vector , and @xmath10 is an angle between @xmath11 and @xmath0 .",
    "hence a mes can also be written as @xmath12 in the parameter space .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath13 .",
    "that is , @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the same state except for a global phase factor .",
    "this is just the case of the double - valued representation of the so(3 ) group , which is written as @xmath16 corresponding to a rotation @xmath17 in real space to a two - state particle .",
    "although @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the same rotation , one has @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the two - qubit mes and the double - valued representation of so(3 ) .",
    "in fact , any mes can be constructed by a rotation from an initial mes , e.g. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 operates on the first particle .",
    "if a rotation operates on the second particle , one has @xmath23",
    "one could define a so(3 ) sphere with diameter @xmath0 filled by vectors @xmath24 .",
    "due to ( [ p10 ] ) a mes corresponds to a point in the so(3 ) sphere , and an evolution of mes corresponds to a trajectory connecting two points .",
    "the initial state @xmath25 locates at the center of the so(3 ) sphere .",
    "consider an electron in a rotating magnetic field @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angle between the field and the z - axis , and @xmath28 is the rotating frequency of the field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the electron is given by @xmath29 the two exact solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation are given by @xmath30 corresponding to energy eigenvalues @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , where @xmath33 where the values of @xmath34 can be determined by normalization of solutions .",
    "now consider an initial state @xmath35/\\sqrt(2 ) \\\\",
    "\\label{evolution1 }   & = & |(\\alpha , \\beta)\\rangle = d_1(\\omega t,\\omega_0 ) |(1,0)\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where new arguments have been assigned to the group element for convenience , and @xmath36 e^{-i\\omega_0 t } , \\\\",
    "\\label{b1 } \\beta & = & i \\sin\\frac { \\omega t } 2 \\frac { a_+ } { a_- } \\frac { \\hbar ( \\omega-2\\omega_0)-2b \\cos\\theta } { 2\\hbar \\omega_0 } e^{i\\omega_0 t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that a rotating magnetic field leads to an evolution of a mes through a continuous trajectory in the so(3 ) sphere .",
    "therefore , a rotating magnetic field is equivalent to a three dimensional rotation in real space to the mes .",
    "it is not surprising that when @xmath37 , the initial state acquires an additional phase of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath38 the amazing property is that the above operation can be allocated to two particles of the initial state , i.e. , @xmath39 in general , one does not have such a property for other initial state . if @xmath40 one will have @xmath41 acquiring no additional phase .",
    "hence , one has a choice for the additional phase through selecting the value of @xmath42 .",
    "now we can trace the following evolution @xmath43/\\sqrt(2 ) \\\\   & = & d_1(\\omega t,\\omega_0 )   d_2(\\omega t,\\omega_0 ) |(1,0)\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the choice @xmath44 this evolution makes a closed trajectory in the so(3 ) sphere .",
    "an example is shown in fig.1 , where parameters @xmath27 and @xmath45 are set to meet @xmath46 .",
    "the final time is @xmath47 , that is , both magnetic fields of the two electrons rotate half a cycle . it is seen that this trajectory breaks three times on the surface of the sphere .",
    "it is known that two ends of a diameter of the sphere correspond to the same rotation but the group element , ( [ dka ] ) , changes its sign . in this case , through a whole trajectory , the mes acquires an additional phase of @xmath0 .    .",
    "the arrow stands for the beginning state and direction of evolution . ]    with proper parameters , one can have closed trajectories with even numbers of breaks , corresponding to a change of @xmath48 in phase .",
    "an example is shown in fig.2 .",
    "hence , one has two classes of trajectories , one of which has an odd number of breaks on the surface of the so(3 ) sphere and the other has an even number of breaks , corresponding to the two classes of the double connectedness of the so(3 ) group .",
    "this is the case that milman and mosseri considered@xcite , whereas their trajectories are hardly possible to be realized , since their magnetic field has to jump through a few discrete points in the parameter space .    .",
    "the arrow stands for the beginning state and direction of evolution . ]",
    "it can easily checked that the closed trajectories @xmath49 and @xmath50 and other ones that milman and mosseri considered @xcite belong to the two simplest classes of trajectories which have @xmath11 or @xmath51 breaks , respectively , in the so(3 ) sphere .",
    "therefore , the present work extends their model to include a great number of closed trajectories with even or odd numbers of breaks .",
    "a entangled photon pair emerging from a double refraction crystal@xcite can be in one of four bell states @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote a horizontally polarized photon state and a vertically polarized one , respectively .",
    "this two entangled photons separate with each other after emission , and then pass through two negative kerr medium p1 and p3 , and two positive kerr medium p2 and p4 , as seen in fig.3 .",
    "the kerr medium are modulated by electric fields , so that their optical axes are in directions as shown in the lower part in fig.3 .",
    "p1 and p3 point to the same direction , say z - axis , and the directions of p2 and p4 can be adjusted by changing the directions of their electric fields .",
    "p1 and p3 change the relative phase between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , working as the following matrix @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the electric field applied to kerr medium p1 and p3 . since the optical exes of p2 and p4 take an angle of @xmath57 with the z - axis , they work as the following matrix , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the electric field applied to p3 and p4 .",
    "it is seen that the combination , @xmath60 , is equivalent to a rotating magnetic field . by comparing eqs.([evolution1],[a1],[b1 ] ) and",
    "eqs.([u1],[a],[b ] ) one finds correspondence @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the evolution in eq.([evolution ] ) , as shown in fig.1 and fig.2 , can be exactly traced by varying the electric fields @xmath56 and @xmath59 on the kerr medium . with proper values of electric fields such that @xmath62 one may obtain an additional @xmath0 phase , or zero additional phase if @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath0 phase can be easily observed by various interference experiments .",
    "for example , according to the scheme described by milman and mosseri considered @xcite , one arm of the entangled photon pair can be transformed into a mach - zender interferometer .",
    "the two wave plates in that scheme are replaced by combinations of kerr medium p1 and p2 , and that of p3 and p4 .    in summary , the present paper sets up a representation for the so(3 ) group by maximally entangled two - qubit states .",
    "the evolution of the entangled states showed the double connectedness of the so(3 ) group . in the so(3 ) sphere the evolution path breaks an odd or even number of times .",
    "an odd number of breaks causes an additional @xmath0 phase to the entangled state , but an even number of breaks does not .",
    "the additional @xmath0 phase can be observed by interference experiments of entangled photon pairs .",
