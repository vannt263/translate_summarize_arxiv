    "one of the outstanding questions in contemporary astronomy is the origin of hecrs ranging from below the knee of the cosmic - ray spectrum at @xmath4 ev to the highest energies exceeding @xmath5 ev .",
    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , defined here as cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies greater than the ankle energy at @xmath6 ev , are probably extragalactic protons in view of their large gyroradii , lack of enhancements of arrival directions toward the galactic plane , the observed flattening of the cosmic - ray spectrum at the ankle ( which could result from photopair energy - loss processes on cosmic - ray protons @xcite ) , and suggestions of a composition change from heavy to light nuclear composition above @xmath7 ev @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "because high - energy protons will radiate @xmath1-ray photons from hadronic and leptonic processes at the site where they are produced , the most likely candidate sources of uhecrs are extragalactic nonthermal @xmath1-ray emitters , specifically grbs and blazar agns .",
    "models for these sources involve jets of relativistic plasma that are ejected by accreting black holes .",
    "the paucity of blazar sources within tens of mpc that could account for the near isotropy of cosmic rays at energies @xmath8 ev suggest that grbs are the sources of uhecrs .",
    "grbs in the galaxy will also accelerate hecrs , and could form most of the cosmic rays with energies between @xmath9 ev and @xmath10 ev .    several types of observations can test this hypothesis .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from a grb , which would requires an ultra - relativistic hadronic component that is much more powerful than the nonthermal electron component that produces the hard x - ray and soft @xmath1-ray emissions from grbs @xcite , is predicted by this model .",
    "another prediction is the detection of hadronic emission components in the spectra of grbs .",
    "the unusual @xmath1-ray emission component observed @xcite in grb 941017 , which could be caused by ultra - relativistic hadron acceleration and photopion processes in the inner jets of grbs @xcite , could be the first example of such a signature .",
    "a third observation that would implicate grbs as the sources of hecrs is the detection of high - energy neutron @xmath2-decay halos around star - forming galaxies @xcite , including @xmath2-decay emission from grbs in the milky way @xcite .",
    "a fourth observation is the absence of @xmath11 ev cosmic - ray _ point - source _ excesses , such as the source claimed to be detected with the sugar array .",
    "this is opposite to the conclusion arrived by @xcite , as explained below , and will soon be tested with the auger experiment , which is now taking data .",
    "we have recently proposed a model for hecrs from galactic and extragalactic grbs @xcite , building on previous suggestions that uhecrs are accelerated by extragalactic grbs @xcite . in our model , relativistic outflows in grbs are assumed to inject power - law distributions of cosmic rays to the highest ( @xmath12 ev ) energies . a diffusive propagation model for hecrs from a single recent grb within @xmath13  kpc from earth that took place within the last 0.5 million years can explain the kascade data for the cr ion spectra near and above the knee . the cr spectrum at energies @xmath11  ev is fit with crs from extragalactic grbs .",
    "uhecrs produced by extragalactic grbs lose energy from momentum redshifting and photo - pair and photo - pion production on the cmbr during propagation through a flat @xmath14cdm universe ( we take @xmath15 and @xmath16 in our calculations ) .",
    "attenuation produces features in the uhecr flux at characteristic energies @xmath17  ev and @xmath18  ev due to photo - pair and photo - pion energy - loss processes , respectively , from distant sources at @xmath19 .",
    "the grb rate - density evolution is assumed to follow the sfr history derived from the blue and uv luminosity density of distant galaxies . to accommodate uncertainty in the sfr evolution ,",
    "we take two models , one based on optical / uv measurements without extinction corrections ( lower sfr ) , and the other with extinction corrections ( upper sfr ) .",
    "the upper sfr is roughly a factor of 3(10 ) greater than the lower sfr at red - shift @xmath20 for @xmath21  ev crs , both evolution models give the same flux , but the upper sfr contributes a factor @xmath22 more cr flux over the lower sfr at energies @xmath23  ev .",
    "ev and using the upper limit to the sfr evolution .",
    "we also show the agasa data ( triangles ) , but do not include these in our fits ( see @xcite for references to the data ) .",
    "the cutoff energy for the galactic - halo component is @xmath24  ev and @xmath25 the fit implies that the transition from galactic to extragalactic crs occurs near the second knee and that the ankle is associated with photo - pair production . ]",
    "the combined kascade , hires - i and hires - ii monocular data between @xmath26  ev to @xmath27  ev are fit in fig.1 which shows our best case , with cosmic - ray number injection index @xmath28 , @xmath29  ev , and the upper sfr .",
    "a @xmath30 spectrum provides a worse fit than the @xmath31 case , although the cr energy demand is less in this case because crs are injected equally per unit decade in particle energy .",
    "the transition between galactic and extragalactic crs is found in the vicinity of the second knee at @xmath32  ev , consistent with a heavy - to - light composition change @xcite .",
    "the ankle , at @xmath33  ev , is interpreted as a suppression from photo - pair losses , analogous to the gzk suppression .",
    "by normalizing the energy injection rate to that required to produce the cr flux from extragalactic sources observed locally , we determine the amount of energy a typical grb must release in the form of nonthermal hadrons .",
    "our results imply that grb blast waves are baryon - loaded by a factor @xmath34 compared to the primary electron energy that is inferred from the fluxes of hard x - rays and soft @xmath1 rays measured from grbs .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the neutrino fluences expected in the collapsar grb scenario from a burst with photon fluence @xmath35 . the neutrino fluences are calculated for 3 values of the doppler factor @xmath36 from a grb at redshift @xmath37 ( we take a hubble constant of 65 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 in the calcuations ) . in order to demonstrate the dependence of the neutrino fluxes on @xmath36 , we consider 3 values of @xmath36 and set @xmath39 in this calculation .",
    "we assume that the prompt emission is contributed by @xmath40 spikes with characteristic timescales @xmath41 each , which defines the characteristic size ( in the proper frame ) of the emitting region associated with each individual spike through the relation @xmath42 .",
    "the numbers of muon neutrinos that would be detected from a single grb with these parameters with icecube for @xmath43 and 300 are @xmath44 and 0.016 , respectively .",
    "we should note , however , that for the assumed value of @xmath45 , the calculated total fluence of neutrinos ( both @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) produced when @xmath48 is @xmath49 erg @xmath50 , i.e. , by a factor @xmath51 _ larger _ than the assumed radiation fluence .",
    "this means that the maximum value of the baryon loading that could be allowed if the high - energy radiation fluence is less than the x/@xmath1 fluence for this particular case should be about 8  10 , instead of 20 , in order that the hadronic cascade @xmath1-ray flux is guaranteed not to exceed the measured photon flux .",
    "consequently , the expected number of neutrinos for @xmath52 should be reduced to @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutrino fluence for the case @xmath54 is equal to @xmath55 , so this accommodates an increased baryon - loading from @xmath56 up to @xmath57 , with the expected number of neutrinos observed by icecube being @xmath58 .",
    "if the radiation fluence at mev ",
    "gev energies is allowed to exceed the x/@xmath1 fluence by an order of magnitude , a possibility that glast will resolve , then the expected number of detected neutrinos could be increased correspondingly .     with x - ray /",
    "mev @xmath1-ray fluence of @xmath59 ergs @xmath50 and doppler factors @xmath48 , 200 and 300 , and a nonthermal baryon - loading factor @xmath60 . ]    for the large baryon load required for the proposed model of hecrs , calculations show that 100 tev ",
    "100 pev neutrinos could be detected several times per year from all grbs with kilometer - scale neutrino detectors such as icecube @xcite .",
    "detection of even 1 or 2 neutrinos from grbs with icecube or a northern hemisphere neutrino detector will provide compelling support for this scenario for the origin of high - energy and uhe cosmic rays .",
    "based on joint analysis of batse large area detector and the egret total absorption shower counter data , gonzlez et al.@xcite reported the detection of an anomalous mev emission component in the spectrum of grb 941017 that decays more slowly than the prompt emission detected with the lad in the @xmath61 kev  1 mev range .",
    "the multi - mev component lasts for @xmath62 seconds ( the @xmath63 duration of the lower - energy prompt component is 77 sec ) , and is detected with the batse lad near 1 mev and with the egret tasc between @xmath13 and 200 mev .",
    "the spectrum is very hard , with a photon number flux @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the observed photon energy .",
    "this component is not predicted or easily explained within the standard leptonic model for grb blast waves , though it possibly could be related to comptonization of reverse - shock emission by the forward shock electrons @xcite , including self - absorbed reverse - shock optical synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that hadronic acceleration in grb blast waves could be responsible for this component .",
    "we have argued @xcite that this component could be a consequence of the acceleration of hadrons at the relativistic shocks of grbs . a pair - photon cascade initiated by photohadronic processes between high - energy hadrons accelerated in the grb blast wave and the internal synchrotron radiation field produces an emission component that appears during the prompt phase , as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "photomeson interactions in the relativistic blast wave also produce a beam of uhe neutrons , as proposed for blazar jets @xcite .",
    "subsequent photopion production of these neutrons with photons outside the blast wave will produce a directed hyper - relativistic electron - positron beam in the process of charged pion decay and the conversion of high - energy photons formed in @xmath66 decay .",
    "these energetic leptons produce a synchrotron spectrum in the radiation reaction - limited regime extending to @xmath67 gev energies , with properties in the 1  200 mev range similar to that measured from grb 941017 .",
    "grbs displaying these anomalous @xmath1-ray components are most likely to be detected as sources of high - energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "if grbs are the sources of hecrs , then high - energy neutrons will be formed at the burst site through photo - pion processes and , being neutral , can escape to intergalactic space .",
    "indeed , it is possible that charged ultra - high energy protons and ions are trapped by ambient magnetic field and lose energy adiabatically near the acceleration site , so that uhecrs are made primarily of neutron - decay protons .    the decay of the neutrons far from the grb through the process @xmath68 leads to @xmath2-decay electrons that make synchrotron and compton radiation .",
    "the best prospect for discovering neutron - decay halos is to search for diffuse optical synchrotron halos surrounding field galaxies that display active star formation @xcite .",
    "grbs that have recently taken place in our galaxy will produce compton radiation at tev energies that could be detected by the _ hess _ and _ veritas _ imaging air cherenkov telescopes @xcite .",
    "the emission of nonthermal synchrotron and compton radiation from photopion processes by uhecrs traveling through intergalactic space will also produce a nonthermal component of the diffuse radiation background , which can be used to determine the magnetic field of intergalactic space .",
    "because the milky way is actively making young high - mass stars , grbs will also occur in our galaxy .",
    "the rate of grbs in the milky way is very uncertain because of lack of precise knowledge about the opening angle of grb jets , but could be as frequent as once every 10,000 years . over the age of the galaxy , there is a good chance that a nearby powerful grb with a jet oriented towards earth could have lethal consequences for life . it has recently been argued @xcite that such an event contributed to the ordovician extinction event 440 myrs ago .",
    "to assess cosmic ray transport from a grb , we @xcite developed a 3d propagation model to simulate the sequence of irradiation events that occurs when a grb jet is pointed towards earth .",
    "the cosmic rays move in response to a large - scale magnetic field that traces the spiral arm structure of the galaxy , and they diffuse through pitch - angle scattering with magnetic turbulence . the magnetic field of the galaxy is modeled as a bi - symmetric spiral for the galaxy s disk , and a dipole magnetic field for the galaxy s halo @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the particle momentum is found by solving the lorentz force equation .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of pitch - angle scattering and diffusion was developed that takes into account the energy dependence of the cosmic - ray mean free path .",
    "4 displays the cosmic - ray halo that surrounds a grb source 14,000 years after the grb event .",
    "the geometry of the system is modeled by twin radial jets of cosmic rays with a jet - opening half - angle of 0.1 radian . a conical shell forms as a result of protons and neutron - decay protons with energies @xmath11 ev .     ",
    "@xmath69 ev . ]    the hypothesis @xcite that the @xmath11 ev cosmic - ray excesses detected with the agasa ( akeno giant air shower array ) and sugar arrays @xcite are cosmic - ray neutrons from a grb is not , however , supported by our simulations . the relativistic blast waves in a grb",
    "accelerate the highest energy cosmic rays over timescales of weeks or less @xcite , and the high - energy neutrons therefore arrive on this same timescale .",
    "cosmic ray protons with energies @xmath70 ev are delayed over a timescale @xmath71 years from a source at the distance of the galactic center . for the sugar excess , which is coincident on the sub - degree angular scale with a point source",
    ", a grb would have to take place within weeks of the observation for cosmic - ray protons to maintain their direction to the source . including the requirement that the grb jet was also pointed towards earth means that an impulsive grb origin is excluded because such an event is so improbable .",
    "the greater ( @xmath72 ) extent of the agasa excess does not conclusively exclude a grb origin , but here the diffuse excess could simply reflect the greater pathlength for cosmic - ray proton collisions with spiral arm gas along the cygnus arm .    because the sugar point source does not admit an impulsive grb solution , only cosmic rays from a persistent source , such as a microquasar , could make such an excess .",
    "the hypothesis @xcite that grbs are sources of @xmath0 ev cosmic rays is therefore incompatible with such a source .",
    "our cosmic - ray origin hypothesis will soon be tested by results from the auger observatory to confirm or refute the existence of the sugar source .",
    "if the source is real , then our grb / cosmic - ray model is incomplete .",
    "we have summarized a complete model @xcite for hecrs from galactic and extragalactic grbs .",
    "our interpretation of the hecr spectrum requires that grbs are hadronically dominated , which is necessary @xcite for neutrinos from grbs to be detectable with a km - scale neutrino telescope .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from grbs will provide strong support for this model .",
    "searches for anomalous @xmath1-ray emission components with _ glast _ ,",
    "as already observed form grb 941017 with batse and egret , will give additional support for cosmic - ray acceleration in grbs , provided that these components can be attributed to hadronic cascade radiation @xcite .",
    "observations of neutron @xmath2-decay radiation from recent grbs in the galaxy @xcite and around galaxies that host grbs @xcite provide further tests of the hypothesis that high - energy cosmic rays are accelerated by grbs .",
    "the ground - based auger experiment , which will measure air showers and nitrogen fluorescence from the uhecr interactions in the atmosphere , is now taking data .",
    "this experiment will greatly expand our knowledge of high - energy cosmic rays , for example , by measuring with high quality statistics and checks on calibration the spectrum of @xmath12 ev cosmic rays which produce high - energy neutrinos at their source and as they propagate through intergalactic space .",
    "detection of @xmath73 ev cosmic - ray point sources is incompatible with an origin from impulsive grbs , so that if the sugar source is confirmed , this cosmic - ray origin model is incomplete .",
