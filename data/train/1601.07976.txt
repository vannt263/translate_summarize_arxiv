    "we can extend the algorithm to compute pareto optimal power allocation for games @xmath45 and @xmath50 by appropriately redefining the augmented lagrangian as @xmath241 for game @xmath45 and @xmath242 for game @xmath50 . since this is a nonconvex optimization problem , algorithm [ algo_pareto ] converges to a local pareto point ( @xcite ) depending on the initial power allocation .",
    "we can get better local pareto points by initializing the algorithm from different power allocations and choosing the pareto point which gives the best sum rate among the ones obtained .",
    "we consider this in our illustrative examples .",
    "in general , pareto optimal points do not guarantee fairness among users , i.e. , algorithm [ algo_pareto ] may converge to a pareto point such that a particular user at the pareto point receives higher rate while another user at the same pareto point receives arbitrarily small rate . in this section",
    "we consider nash bargaining solutions which are also pareto optimal solutions but guarantee fairness .    in nash bargaining",
    ", we specify a disagreement outcome that specifies utility of each user that it receives by playing the disagreement strategy if the utility received in the bargaining outcome is less than that received in the disagreement outcome for any user .",
    "thus , by choosing the disagreement outcomes appropriately , the users can ensure certain fairness .",
    "the nash bargaining solutions are pareto optimal and also satisfy certain natural axioms @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for a two player game , there exists a unique bargaining solution ( if the feasible region is nonempty ) that satisfies the axioms stated above and it is given by the solution of the optimization problem @xmath243 for an n - user nash bargaining problem , this result can be extended and the solution of an n - user bargaining problem is the solution of the optimization problem @xmath244    a nash bargaining solution is also related to proportional fairness , another fairness concept commonly used in communication literature .",
    "a utility vector @xmath245 is said to be _ proportionally fair _ if for any other feasible vector @xmath246 , for each @xmath124 , the aggregate proportional change @xmath247 is non - positive @xcite . if the set @xmath248 is convex , then nash bargaining and proportional fairness are equivalent @xcite .",
    "a major issue in finding a solution of a bargaining problem is choosing the disagreement outcome .",
    "it is more common to consider an equilibrium point as a disagreement outcome . in our problem",
    "we can consider the utility vector at a ne as the disagreement outcome .",
    "we can also choose @xmath249 for each @xmath4 .",
    "for our numerical evaluations we have chosen the disagreement outcome to be a zero vector . to find the bargaining solution , i.e. , to solve the optimization problem ( [ nb_n ] )",
    ", we use the algorithm of section [ pareto ] used to find a pareto optimal point but with the objective function @xmath250 in section [ ne ] , we present a nash bargaining solution for the numerical examples we consider and observe that the nash bargaining solution obtained is a pareto optimal point which provides fairness among the users .",
    "in section [ gen_vi ] , we discussed a heuristic algorithm to find a ne when the matrix @xmath129 is not positive semidefinite . even though the heuristic can be used to compute a ne , we do not have a proof of its convergence to a ne . in this section ,",
    "we use bayesian learning that guarantees convergence to an @xmath0-nash equilibrium of the partial information game @xmath50 where @xmath251 can be chosen arbitrarily small .",

    "a static game is played repeatedly for an infinite horizon and users update their strategies @xmath254 each time the game is played .",
    "no user has knowledge about the opponents strategy @xmath258 . but",
    "each user is provided with the actions chosen by the opponents in a time slot at the end of that time slot .",
    "let @xmath259 be the action chosen by user @xmath4 in time slot @xmath260 .",
    "in bayesian learning , each user @xmath4 has a belief @xmath261 about strategy of user @xmath3 , for each @xmath3 with @xmath262 .",
    "each user , after every time slot @xmath260 , finds the posterior belief on the opponents strategies from the prior beliefs using bayesian update rule , after observing the opponents actions in time slot @xmath260 . after finding the posterior beliefs @xmath263",
    ", each user chooses a strategy that maximizes its utility , assuming that all the opponents follow their beliefs . following this procedure ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the posterior beliefs of all players converge to a @xmath0-ne .",
    "we adapt this procedure to find a @xmath0-ne of our game @xmath50 . for this , we consider finite power levels at which a user can transmit .",
    "let @xmath264 be the set of power levels at which user @xmath4 can transmit .",
    "these power levels can be different for different users . then the strategy set @xmath51 of user @xmath4 with average power constraint is @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the probability of occurrence of @xmath267 channel state .",
    "the strategy set of each user is finite . to use the traditional bayesian learning ,",
    "each user needs to know the action chosen by the other users .",
    "in general , a transmitter can not observe powers used by the other transmitters .",
    "the purpose of knowing the actions of other users in bayesian learning is to learn the strategies of other players and each user finds its best response with respect to the learned strategies of other users . in our problem , for each user to find its best response to a given strategy of the other users , it is enough to know the interference level that is experienced by its corresponding receiver . as the receiver can feedback the interference it has seen in a slot by the end of that slot to its transmitter , it is enough to learn the distribution of the interference rather than the strategy of the other users .",
    "hence , each user has belief on the distribution of the interference rather than having a belief on the strategies of opponents .",
    "each user updates its belief on the distribution on the interference using the bayesian update with the help of feedback from its receiver",
    ".    let @xmath268 denote the set of possible interference levels for user @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the belief of user @xmath4 about the distribution of interference experienced at its receiver by @xmath269 . with respect to this belief @xmath269",
    ", user @xmath4 finds the best response @xmath254 and chooses an action according to the best response .",
    "please note that @xmath269 is a probability mass function on @xmath268 where as @xmath254 is a probability mass function on @xmath51 .",
    "after every time slot @xmath270 user @xmath4 updates its belief @xmath269 based on the feedback received from its receiver using laplace estimator @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the number of time instances that the interference level @xmath273 occurred up to time @xmath274 , @xmath275 is the cardinality of @xmath268 , and @xmath276 is any positive integer .",
    "the laplace estimator ( [ lap_est ] ) uses bayesian update @xcite and guarantees absolute continuity condition that is necessary for convergence @xcite .",
    "thus , as each user @xmath4 plays its best response with respect to @xmath269 , the strategies converge to an @xmath0-ne .",
    "we will use this algorithm on some examples in the next section .",
    "in this section we compare the sum rate achieved at a nash equilibrium and a pareto optimal point obtained by the algorithms provided above . in all our numerical computations we choose @xmath277 in computations of pareto points .",
    "in all the examples considered below , we have chosen @xmath278 with the step size in the steepest descent method @xmath279 and updated after @xmath280 iterations as @xmath281 .",
    "we choose a 3-user interference channel for examples 1 and 2 below .    for example 1 , we take @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "we assume that all elements of @xmath284 occur with equal probability , i.e. , with probability 0.5 .",
    "now , the @xmath129 matrix is not positive definite .",
    "thus , the algorithm in @xcite may not converge to a ne for @xmath40 .",
    "algorithm [ s_min ] converges to a ne not only for @xmath40 but also for @xmath45 and @xmath50 .",
    "we compare the sum rates for the ne under different assumptions in figure [ 4_plot ] .",
    "we have also computed @xmath285 that maximizes the corresponding lower bounds ( [ in_lb ] ) , evaluated the sum rate @xmath286 and compared to the sum rate at a ne .",
    "the sum rates at nash equilibria for @xmath45 and @xmath50 are close .",
    "this is because the values of the cross link channel gains are close and hence knowing the cross link channel gains has less impact .            in example 2 , we take @xmath282 and @xmath287 .",
    "we assume that all elements of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 occur with equal probability .",
    "we compare the sum rates for the ne obtained by algorithm [ s_min ] in figure [ 4_plot2 ] .",
    "now we see significant differences in the sum rates . for this example",
    ", we compare the rates of each user at a pareto point and nash bargaining for games @xmath40 , @xmath45 , and @xmath50 in tables [ tab : g_a ] , [ tab : g_i ] , and [ tab : g_d ] respectively . from these tables",
    "we can observe that the pareto optimal points yield better sum rate than at the ne .",
    "it can also be seen that the nash bargaining solutions provide more fairness than the pareto points .",
    "we consider a 2-user interference channel in example 3 .",
    "we take @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "we assume that all elements of @xmath284 occur with equal probability for user 1 , and that the distributions of direct and cross link channel gains are identical for user 2 and are given by @xmath290 . in this example also , we use algorithm [ s_min ] to find ne for the different cases , and also obtain the lower bound for the partial information cases .",
    "we compare the sum rates for the ne in figure [ plot3 ] .",
    "we further elaborate on the usefulness of phase 1 in algorithm [ s_min ] .",
    "we quantify the closeness of @xmath124 to a ne by @xmath291 .",
    "if @xmath124 is a ne then @xmath292 , and for two different power allocations @xmath124 and @xmath293 we say that @xmath124 is closer to a ne than @xmath293 if @xmath294 .",
    "we now verify that the fixed point iterations in phase 1 of algorithm [ s_min ] take us closer to a ne starting from any randomly chosen feasible power allocation .",
    "for this , we have randomly generated @xmath295 feasible initial power allocations and run phase 1 for @xmath296 iterations for each randomly chosen initial power allocation , and compared the values of @xmath297 . in the following ,",
    "we compare the mean , over the 100 initial points chosen , of the values of @xmath297 immediately after random generation of feasible power allocations , to those after running phase 1 .",
    "we summarize the comparison of mean value of @xmath297 before and after phase 1 of algorithm [ s_min ] , in tables [ 4_table1 ] , [ 4_table2 ] and [ 4_table3 ] for examples 1 , 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "the first column of the table indicates the constrained average transmit snr in db .",
    "the second and the third columns correspond to the power allocation game with complete channel knowledge , @xmath40 .",
    "the fourth and the fifth columns correspond to the power allocation game with knowledge of the incident channel gains , @xmath45 . the sixth and the seventh columns correspond to the power allocation game with direct link channel knowledge , @xmath50 .",
    "the second , fourth and sixth columns indicate the mean of @xmath297 before running phase 1 , where @xmath124 is a randomly generated feasible power allocation .",
    "the mean value is evaluated over @xmath295 samples of different random feasible power allocations .",
    "the third , fifth and seventh columns indicate the mean value of @xmath297 after running phase 1 in algorithm [ s_min ] for the same random feasible power allocations .",
    "it can be seen from the tables that running phase 1 prior to phase 2 reduces the value of @xmath297 when compared with a randomly generated feasible power allocation .",
    "thus , the power allocation after running phase 1 will be a good choice of power allocation to start the steepest descent in phase 2 .",
    "it can also be seen that for all the three examples , for @xmath45 and @xmath50 , phase 1 itself converges to the ne , whereas for @xmath40 phase 1 may not converge .    at snr of 20db , for @xmath40 , algorithm [ s_min ] converged in one iteration of phase 1 and phase 2 for examples 1 and 3 .",
    "for example 2 , algorithm [ s_min ] converged after phase 1 in the second iteration of phase 1 and phase 2 .",
    "phase 2 converged to a local optimum in about 200 iterations in example 1 , about 400 iterations for example 3 and about 250 iterations in example 2 .",
    "we have run algorithm [ s_min ] on many more examples and found that for @xmath45 and @xmath50 , phase 1 itself converged to the ne .",
    "we illustrate bayesian learning for example 2 with @xmath298 and @xmath299 for each @xmath300 .",
    "we assume that all elements of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 occur with equal probability .",
    "each user transmits data at rate @xmath217 given by ( [ rate_direct ] ) with a power level between @xmath301 and @xmath302 which is a multiple of @xmath303 .",
    "each user has a belief on the distribution of interference experienced by its receiver and uses bayesian learning to find a ne of @xmath50 .",
    "we tabulate these rates in table [ table4 ] for all the three users at a @xmath0-ne computed via the bayesian learning algorithm , and we also compare the sum rates at ne obtained using variational inequality approach and bayesian learning in figure [ plot_baye ] . it can be seen from figure [ plot_baye ] that the sum rates achieved via the vi heuristic and using bayesian learning are very close .    in our simulations for example 2 , at transmit snr of 15db , to find a ne of @xmath304 using variational inequality approach requires about @xmath305 iterations in phase @xmath191 .",
    "the overall run time of the vi based heuristic algorithm is about @xmath306 seconds for @xmath45 and @xmath307 seconds for @xmath50 on an _ i5 - 2400 _ processor with clock speed @xmath308ghz .",
    "bayesian learning converges to a ne in about @xmath309 iterations and the run time for the program on the same processor is about @xmath310 seconds . even though bayesian learning requires a larger number of iterations to converge",
    ", its per iteration complexity is less which reduces run time . but this run time increases significantly if we increase the number of feasible power levels .",
    "using vi approach and bayesian learning for example 2.,width=377,height=188 ]",
    "we have considered a channel shared by multiple transmitter - receiver pairs causing interference to one another .",
    "we formulated stochastic games for this system in which transmitter - receiver pairs may or may not have information about other pairs channel gains . exploiting variational inequalities , we presented a heuristic algorithm that obtains a ne in the various examples studied , quite efficiently .    in the games with partial information , we presented a lower bound on the utility of each user at any ne .",
    "a utility of at least this lower bound can be attained by a user using a water - filling like power allocation , that can be computed with the knowledge of the distribution of its own channel gains and of the average power constraints of all the users .",
    "this power allocation is especially useful when any transmitter fails to receive the power variables from the other transmitters that are required for it to compute its ne power allocation .    in all the games ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath40 , @xmath45 and @xmath50 , we also provide algorithms to compute the pareto points and nash bargaining solutions which yield better sum rate than the ne .",
    "the nash bargaining solutions are fairer to users than the pareto points .",
    "bayesian learning has been used to compute ne for general channel conditions .",
    "it is observed that , even though bayesian learning takes more iterations to compute ne than the heuristic , it requires less information about the other users and their strategies .",
    "but to use bayesian learning , we quantize the power levels and it is the price we pay for not having more information .",
