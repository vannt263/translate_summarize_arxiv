    "in our papers @xcite an alternative approach to the conventional partial - wave analysis was suggested to represent the few - dimensional schrdinger equation on the basis constructed from the eigenfunctions of the angular momentum square operator defined on the angular grid in the spirit of the discrete variable representation ( dvr ) @xcite or the lagrange - mesh method @xcite .    to construct the basis orthogonal on the angular grid for one angular variable",
    "is a solvable problem if to chose the grid points coinciding with the nodes of the gauss quadrature .",
    "different kinds of the one - dimensional dvr or lagrange - meshes are broadly applied for quantum computations@xcite due to the simplicity and efficiency of this approach . however , an extension of this representation to the two - dimensional case ( two angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the unit sphere ) is a nontrivial problem . actually , the simple idea to construct the two - dimensional dvr as a direct product of two one - dimensional dvrs leads to essential complication of the matrix of the angular part of the kinetic energy operator . as a result",
    ", the advantages of the one - dimensional dvr , its simplicity and efficiency , are loosing @xcite . another way to construct two - dimensional dvr on an unit sphere",
    "is to use the spherical harmonics defined on the two - dimensional grid .",
    "however , at that it becomes not possible to satisfy the orthogonality conditions for all the elements of the fixed set of this basis on the chosen grid . to overcome this difficulty we have suggested @xcite to use the basis of the orthogonalyzed combinations of the spherical harmonics on the two - dimensional grid over @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables .",
    "it happened that this idea was very efficient for the time - dependent schrdinger equation with three nonseparable spatial variables @xcite .",
    "particularly , it has permitted to get with this approach a few important results in problems of the atomic interaction with strong external electric and magnetic fields@xcite , the coulomb breakup of halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , we have extended this method to the problem of the stripping and excitation of helium ions by protons@xcite and antiprotons .",
    "we also analysed for the first time the three - dimensional anisotropic scattering in the problem of ultracold atom - atom collisions in a laser field @xcite .",
    "experimental investigation of the collisions for slow antiprotons ( @xmath2 ) with hydrogen and helium becomes an actual problem for antiproton physics .",
    "it provides a strong challenge to theory .",
    "actually , there has been done a large number of theoretical studies of the @xmath2-h and @xmath2-he@xmath3 recently .",
    "however , more or less convergent results were obtained only for ionization in the collisions @xmath2-h(1s ) and @xmath2-he@xmath3(1s ) from the ground states ( where there is an agreement within about 20% between the existing calculations ) and also some attempts were done for @xmath2-he@xmath3(2s ) ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "we have obtained new theoretical results for ionization and excitation / deexcitation processes in slow collisions ( 100 kev @xmath4 e@xmath5 0.1 kev ) of @xmath6 with h and he@xmath7 ( some of them are given in the table i ) .",
    "particularly , we have calculated for the first time the cross sections from the initial states with all possible @xmath8 0 to all possible excitations up to n@xmath9=10 .",
    "the developed quantum time - dependent approach based on our ideas suggested in @xcite opens , thanks to its efficiency and flexibility , unique possibilities for treating different cascade processes in antiproton physics .",
