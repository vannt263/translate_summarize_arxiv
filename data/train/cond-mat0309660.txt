    "the dynamics of slow relaxation systems exhibits peculiar characteristics which make it essentially different from the dynamics of systems relaxing in much shorter time scales @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the aging behaviour of the correlation functions @xcite and the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite and of the stokes - einstein relation @xcite are among those significant features which have attracted the interest of many researchers in the last few years .",
    "relaxation phenomena in glasses , polymers , colloids and granular matter provide innumerable situations demanding new theoretical * * * * developments whose implementation constitutes * * * * a challenge for nonequilibrium statistical mechanics theories . * *    the origin of that peculiar behaviour lies in the fact that during its evolution , the system rests permanently away from equilibrium .",
    "this feature would justify why results obtained when * * * * the system is close to equilibrium are not necessary valid when that condition is not fulfilled . * * * * a simple example illustrating this point is supplied from the slow dynamics of a two - level system . during the transition , the system does not thermally equilibrate with the bath and as a consequence equipartition law is not valid .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that coarsening the level of description of the path that the system follows in the configuration space going from diffusion to activation regimes leads to violation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the fast decay of the diffusion modes makes the system always close to equilibrium whereas the activation process occurring at longer time scales does not guarantee validity of the theorem .    in this paper",
    "we will present an example illustrating the peculiar dynamics of slow relaxation systems . using a fokker - planck description",
    "we derive a generalized stokes - einstein relation for supercooled colloidal liquids showing that diffusion coefficient and inverse of viscosity are not proportional to each other at low frequencies , when the system becomes activated . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the particles undergo diffusion in the solvent and that relation holds .",
    "the paper will be distributed as follows . in section * ii * , we will briefly review the generalization of the onsager fluctuation theory to nonequilibrium _ aging _ states .",
    "section * iii * will be devoted to the formulation of a mean field theory describing the dynamics of high concentrated suspensions .",
    "this theory will be used in section * iv * to interpret experimental results supporting the violation of the stokes - einstein relation in supercooled colloidal liquids . in the conclusions section",
    "we will summarize our main results .",
    "when the relaxation of a system is slow enough , its evolution takes place through a sequence of states characterized by a set of thermodynamical quantities * * * * in which the intensive parameters are , in general , different from those of the bath . * * * * it is then said that the system is at quasi - equilibrium .",

    "in this paper , we have proposed a general formalism to analyze the dynamics of systems which relax in long time scales of the order of the observation time or even longer .",
