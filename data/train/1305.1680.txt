    "solar flares are transient eruptive events characterized by a localized increase in radiation from the solar atmosphere .",

    "the temporal cadence of these instruments proves ideal for studying eruptive solar events .",
    "in addition to enhancements in euv intensity , flares are associated with increased x - ray radiation .",
    "the geostationary operational environmental satellite ( goes ) has provided full disk measurements of soft x - ray emission ( sxr ) since the mid 1970s @xcite .",
    "many previous studies have used statistical methods to characterize and parameterize various flare behaviors : frequency distributions @xcite , temporal distributions @xcite , the neupert effect @xcite , euv and sxr enhancements @xcite , energy partitioning @xcite , as well as the long term variability in flares over several solar cycles @xcite .",
    "these studies have utilized observations from a great variety of instruments in a variety of wavelengths ( sxr , hxr , euv , as well as h@xmath0 ) .",
    "furthermore , these statistical studies of flares vary greatly in sample size , ranging from a few handfuls to tens of thousands of events .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show , using goes data , that the flare occurrence rate , as a function of peak flux , follows a power law .",
    "these studies , as well as @xcite , also demonstrate smooth distributions of flare rise , and decay , and total durations ; @xcite further shows a loose but positive correlation between duration and goes class .",
    "similar studies have been performed by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "these studies , which focus on the distribution of temporal parameters , such as duration , rise time , decay time , and flare asymmetry , typically omit analysis of non - temporal flare parameters ( other than goes class ) . studies such as @xcite and @xcite analyze various energy partitions within flares but do not consider temporal aspects or thermal parameters .",
    "@xcite address the statistical behavior temperature and emission measure .",
    "our work expands upon these previous studies through considering a variety of flare parameters .",
    "we presently relate temporal parameters ( duration , rise time , decay time , as well as intervals between various emission peaks ) with thermal parameters ( radiated energy , peak temperature , and emission measure ) , as well as spatial parameters ( observed volumes and loop lengths ) .",
    "previously , @xcite studied the statistical relationships between these quantities in both stellar and solar flares , empirically deriving several power laws for the global behavior of several flare parameters .    unlike these previous studies , we constrain our analysis to a single goes flare class , considering only events with an uncorrected peak observed soft x - ray flux within a small range ( @xmath1 ) around @xmath2 w m@xmath3 . through constraining a single quantity , such as goes flux , we are able to relate these flare parameters with great transparency and certainty , providing for an enhanced understanding of global flare behavior .",
    "these c8 flares are medium sized events , occurring relatively frequently , which generally stand out strongly against background radiation .",
    "this class includes a variety of flares , ranging from the highly impulsive eruptions to long duration two ribbon events .",
    "these c8 flares may be extremely hot or relatively cool events , and may occur in small compact loops or as large filament eruptions .",
    "furthermore , by analyzing data from both sdo and goes , we can determine the behavior of these flares across a broad range of wavelengths , as well as characterize relationships between x - ray and euv radiation .",
    "the selection of flares within a narrow goes flux range , coupled with other selection criteria ( see discussion in section 2.4 ) , has significantly impacted the sample size of this study , which is limited to 17 flare events occurring the period between april 2011 and august 2012 .    in section [ sec data_ac ]",

    ", we only consider flares with an approximate c8 goes class  i.e .",
    "the pre - background subtraction soft x - ray peak intensity was approximately @xmath2 w m@xmath3 .",
    "we define temporal parameters of these flares using the full width quarter - max ( fwqm ) value of background subtracted goes measurements ( see example in figure [ fig sample_time ] ) . the rise time , @xmath4 , is given as the time between first quarter - max intensity and peak intensity , while the decay time , @xmath5 , is given as the time between the peak and the return to this quarter - max value .",
    "the total duration of the flare is given as the full width quarter - max time , @xmath6 .",
    "the fwqm duration includes the vast majority of the observed decay of the flare while simultaneously avoiding significant interference from the background sxr flux or other flares .    in order to remove the contribution from quiet sun emission from our analysis ,",
    "the average flux over a quiescent period preceding the flare was subtracted ; a similar subtraction was used for the eve data .",
    "@xcite developed an advanced method for background subtraction .",
    "our sample is restricted to flares which are fairly isolated from other x - ray events ( see section 2.4 ) ; this constraint helps to mediate the contribution of solar background flux to the enhanced flare emission , making a more advanced background subtraction unnecessary . table [",
    "flare_table ] , which lists the selected events , includes both the uncorrected flux , used in the goes classification , as well as the background subtracted flux ; the maximum deviation of our background subtracted values from the c8 flux level is approximately 20% .",
    "several sswidl functions exist , e.g. @xcite , which use the intensity ratio between the long and short flux channels as well as the chianti atomic database @xcite to perform diagnostics of temperature and emission measure .",
    "the subtraction of the goes background is necessary to ensure the quality of these diagnostics .",

    "we note that these constants are unphysical quantities used only to define our line of best fit ; in the limit of zero total radiated emission , the rise energy should clearly tend to zero .",
    "it is striking that a linear correlation between energies emitted in the rise and decay phase of the flares occurs in both eve and goes observations .",
    "the difference in percentage of energy partitioned in the rise phase between these two instruments ( @xmath22% for goes and @xmath23 for eve ) follows from differences in their temperature response functions .",
    "goes is sensitive to high temperature plasmas present early in the flare , while broadband eve observations include many cooler spectral lines .",
    "emission from these euv spectral lines , brightest primarily in the decay phase of a flare , are a significant portion of the total euv radiation .",
    "accordingly , compared with goes x - ray observations , the rise phase euv emission accounts for a lower percentage of the total euv flare radiation .",
    "the correlations found between characteristic flare times , as well as sxr and euv energies , are sensitive to the definition of the fwqm time scale .",

    "table [ time_defs ] shows the various linear slopes and correlation values calculated for the time , sxr , and euv energies .",
    "the use of fw1/8 m and fw1/16 m values causes the slope relating the duration of the rise phase relative to the total flare duration to decrease . because of the impulsive nature of the rise phase",
    ", alternate definitions of the start time do not greatly affect the length of the rise phase .",
    "however , the decay time , and thus the total duration , is significantly affected by these distinctions .",
    "though the use of alternate time definitions impacts the reported durations of these events , we continue to find linear relationships between rise time and total time .",
    "similarly , using alternate definitions primarily affects the energy reported in the flare decay phase .",
    "however , table [ time_defs ] shows that a highly correlated energy partition exists regardless of particular time definitions used . in exploring time definitions which extend the flare duration ( i.e. the fw1/8 m and fw1/16 m ) , we find that the proportion of flare energy partitioned in the rise phase decreases .",
    "in addition to time scales and broadband radiated energy , we use our constraint of goes class to consider a range of flare properties .",

    "accordingly , the scaling shown between , for instance , flare temperature with the total radiated energy determines the scaling between emission measure and energy .",
    "this figure shows that the more energetic , accordingly longer duration , events of our sample of c8 flares are cooler ; in order for cooler events to have a peak c8 flux , these flares must have characteristically higher emission measures .",

    "though highly quantifiable uncertainties are difficult to determine for these loop lengths we are highly confident that these estimations are accurate within a factor of two .",
    "the derived lengths are , for the most part , within this range of uncertainty .",
    "the dashed line in the bottom plot shows the 1 - 1 correspondence ; we note that the data roughly follow this trend , but with a notable scatter .",
    "we have established that these flares vary significantly in their energetic , temporal , and thermal aspects .",
    "understanding the correlations between the temporal and thermal parameters allows for deeper analysis of the variability in euv spectral emission .",
    "for instance , we show how the lower temperatures and densities of the longer duration c8 events help explain aspects of the diverse spectral signatures observed by eve .",
    "durations for each lightcurve were calculated with the fwqm method used in determining characteristic times from goes .",
    "figure [ fig lc_durations ] shows the duration of each lightcurve , including the goes 1 - 8  channel , as a function of the total radiated euv energy .",
    "each spectral line shows the expected correlation between duration and total radiated euv output : longer duration flares are more emissive .",
    "the 335  duration shows a particularly high dependence on the total emitted radiation ; for the largest events , this emission lasts significantly longer than the hotter spectral lines . in both the impulsive and intermediate flares , 335  emission endures on time scales similar to the hotter spectral lines .        for several flares in the sample , the cooler and spectral lines do not return to pre - flare levels  e.g .",
    "284  emission from the 2011 may 29 event displayed in figure [ fig sample_eve_lcs ] .",
    "this effect occurs in three 284  and four 335  lightcurves .",
    "the lack of full decay is typically attributed to either interruptions by other events or the presence of late phase emission outlined by @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "because these lightcurves do not have a determinable fwqm duration , they were omitted from figure [ fig lc_durations ] . though observed in several of the flares in our sample , full consideration of late phase emission is out of the immediate scope of this study .",
    "other data were omitted when flare emission in a given wavelength did not significantly increase above background levels : e.g. , the cooler spectral lines in the 2011 november 15 event .",
    "flare cooling can be demonstrated through analysis of the peak emission times of different spectral lines .",
    "each lightcurve ( except 304  ) is dominated by emission from a specific ionization state of iron .",
    "these ionization states have a broad range in formation temperature .",
    "accordingly , the time elapsed between each lightcurve peak is indicative of the thermal evolution of the flare plasma . figure [ fig lc_peaks ] displays the intervals between the peak time of each lightcurve and the time of peak goes flux , negative values mean the lightcurve attained a maximum value before the goes lightcurve ; once again this figure omits non - flaring spectral lines .",
    "@xcite use a similar technique to show the thermal evolution of several flares through eve data .    in the hotter and less energetic events ,",
    "each lightcurve peaks within a few minutes of the others , indicating the rapid evolution in these flares .",
    "the intermediate events show a similar behavior in the hotter spectral lines ; in contrast , these events show a significant scatter in the the peak times of the cooler 284 and 335  lightcurves .",
    "as expected , we find that 335  emission consistently peaks before the slightly cooler 284  .",
    "time intervals between successive lightcurve peaks are increased in the flares which emitted the most radiation .",
    "the 304  line , with a peak formation temperature around 80,000 k , is indicative of impulsive chromospheric heating . for low and intermediate energy flares ,",
    "maximum 304  emission occurs within the several minutes around the goes peak ; alternatively , with the longer duration flares , 304  emission is a consistent precursor to the peak goes flux .",
    "the timing of peak temperature and emission measure with respect to the peak intensities of the goes and eve lightcurves , also shown in figure [ fig lc_peaks ] , can help explain phenomena observed in the eve lightcurves .",
    "spectral line intensity , given by the equation @xmath50 is highly dependent on flare temperature and emission measure .",
    "the evolution of these parameters are key in the timing and intensity of the eve lightcurves .",
    "though the peak intensities of 133  and sxr emission generally occur at the same time , 133  emission peaks significantly earlier in the two most energetic flares . in these same events ,",
    "the maximum temperature also occurs significantly earlier relative to the other events in our sample .",
    "the 133  spectral line and goes are both sensitive to temperatures greater than log t=7.1 ; however , the goes 1 - 8  response function also has significant contribution from lower temperature plasma .",
    "the advancement of 133  emission occurs because of the relative early timing of the peak temperature .",
    "in contrast , the maximum goes flux , can occur when peak when temperatures are lower .",
    "additionally , the later occurrence of peak emission measure suggests that cooler spectral lines should be more emissive in longer duration events : peak emission measure occurs when the plasma temperature is lower .",
    "figure [ fig max_lc_intens ] , which shows the maximum intensities achieved by each lightcurve as a function of the total euv energy , is consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "other than the 304  emission , which is the result of particle deposition and heating of the chromosphere through conductive fronts , the cooler 284 and 335  spectral lines are notably bright in long duration events , dominating over the hotter spectral emission .",
    "figure [ fig max_lc_intens ] furthermore shows that the peak flux in the 94 and 109  wavelengths have upward trends with the total emitted euv energy .",
    "this result is consistent with our finding that the emission measure remains enhanced though the peak temperature has decreased ; not only do lines formed under log t = 7 peak later in the most energetic events , they are also more emissive . this upward trend is also contributed to by the slight positive correlation in the size of emission measure with flare duration and energy reported in section 3.2 .    in comparison with the other spectral lines ,",
    "the peak intensity of the 133  emission is fairly constant across our sample .",
    "the formation temperature of the 133  is similar to the goes 1 - 8  x - ray emission .",
    "because the flares in our sample have a constrained peak goes flux , it is not surprising that the magnitude of 133  emission is relatively constant in our sample .",
    "we furthermore find that 133  emission is typically more dominant in the lower energy , shorter duration events .",
    "our analysis shows trends in the peak intensities of euv spectral lines with increasing emitted energy , however there are several spectral lines which do not show clear positive trends .",
    "for instance , though it increases in the most energetic events , the peak intensity of 284  emission does not show a consistent correlation with increased total radiation in the impulsive and intermediate flares . additionally , as shown in figure [ fig max_lc_intens ] , the peak intensity of 304  emission ranges over an order of magnitude in the flares of our sample .",
    "for the both the impulsive ( less energetic ) and intermediate events there is no clear correlation with the total emitted energy .",
    "the most energetic flares in our sample always appear to always show large emission .",
    "however , given the dispersion present in the impulsive and intermediate events , the inclusion of more data is needed to concretely determine the behavior of the line in these cases .",
    "correlations between the durations and energies in rise and decay phases suggest that the energy release process in flares is determined early in the flare evolution . based on our results ,",
    "several characteristics of the flare in its decay phase can be forecasted by observing the rise phase .",
    "we show that through constraining both the peak goes flux and flare rise time , other physical parameters of a flare are determined ; within our results , determination of two parameters is sufficient to roughly determine the flare s behavior .",
    "while this scaling applies to the single c8 class analyzed in this work , future work will investigate whether a similar scaling holds to additional flare classes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that for a broad range of goes classes , the time integrated flux of flare is proportional to the peak goes flux times the duration .",
    "this result , consistent with our findings , suggests that several of the correlations reported within our study are applicable to additional flare classes .",
    "constraining goes class has proved a novel tool in the analysis of flare dynamics . in considering flares of",
    "multiple goes classes , the correlations in energetic and temporal parameters within a single flare class are not immediately clear . with no constraint on peak sxr flux ,",
    "these significant correlations within a single flare class are easily hidden within the statistical dispersion of a large sample set : e.g. figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "in addition to our investigation of the temporal and energetic aspects of a flare , the constraint of goes class allows for a robust analysis of parameters such as temperature , emission measure , volume , and density .",
    "we have shown that within a single goes class , the largest flares with the greatest amounts of emitted radiation are characteristically cooler , more voluminous , and less dense than less energetic events . as the temperatures of longer duration events are cooler , the emission measure of these events are correspondingly higher .",
    "the strength of these scaling laws as well as their applicability over the entire range of c8 flares will provide a useful foundation for future work , particularly regarding flare models and the development of scaling laws .",
    "these empirically determined relations between flare parameters are straightforward and easily comparable with physical models . for instance , we have shown that a length diagnostic given for a single flaring loop by @xcite compares surprisingly well with the observed data .",
    "it is interesting that this single loop model is able to reasonably diagnose loop lengths for such a range of flares : this model provides order of magnitude estimates for loop lengths of hot compact flares , events composed of a few closely bundled strands , as well as highly complex long duration events which incorporate vast numbers of coronal loops .",
    "these results are relevant in the context of stellar studies , where direct imaging of coronal plasma is not possible and indirect means of measurement are required to diagnose the spatial distribution of emitting coronal plasma .",
    "assuming that similar results extend to different classes of flares , our findings suggest that this diagnostic , based on single loop hydrodynamic models of flares , is robust and provides sound estimates for flares which clearly involve several loop structures .    scaling",
    "laws proposed by @xcite relate the flare decay time with the temperature and length of the loop : @xmath51 where @xmath43 is the loop length , @xmath52 is the decay time , @xmath45 is the peak flare temperature . the derivation of this scaling law considers both the conductive and radiative cooling times .",
    "@xcite modified this law , including an empirically derived function @xmath53 to account for heating in the flare decay phase .",
    "@xmath54    from these equations , it is clear that the duration of a flare increases with longer loop lengths and lower temperatures .",
    "the diagnostics of section [ subsec temp ] show that the longer duration flares in our sample have characteristically lower temperatures and densities , as well as longer loop lengths .",
    "accordingly , we expect these flares to have longer characteristic cooling times .",
    "figure [ fig lc_peaks ] shows that eve observations are consistent with this analysis of cooling times : cooler flares with longer loop lengths are drawn out over extended periods of time .",
    "the temporal evolution of parameters such as temperature and emission measure are also related to the flare cooling rate .",
    "prolonged cooling times increase the intervals between the various stages of flare evolution .",
    "therefore , in the long duration events , we expect an increased interval between the peak flare temperature and , for example , the peak sxr flux . in these flares",
    ", peak emission measure should occur relatively later in time : enhancements in coronal emission measure arise from the conductive heating of flare footpoints , resulting in the evaporation of chromospheric plasma .",
    "this process is prolonged by the longer cooling times .",
    "previously , @xcite empirically determined scaling laws using statistical observations of both solar and stellar flares : @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the temperature at the peak flare time , @xmath58 , is the total duration and @xmath43 is the flare loop length .",
    "these power laws , which show positive relationships between temperature , duration , and loop length , represent global flare behavior without regard to goes class .",
    "these power laws , derived from both extremely large and small events , observed on both the sun as well as other stars , show positive correlations between flare parameters such as loop length and temperature .",
    "however , our results show that within a single goes class , these flare parameters are negatively correlated .",
    "these results show that global correlations are not applicable to constrained subsets of flares , such as the c8 flare class .",
    "this study uses eve and aia data to analyze relatively isolated solar flares within a small range around the c8 goes class ( events with peak flux around @xmath2 w m@xmath3 ) . through constraining our statistical analysis to flares of a single",
    "goes class , we show the diversity of events which produce the same peak sxr flux .",
    "this work explicitly demonstrates how greatly duration , emitted radiation , temperature , volume , and density may vary within a single goes flare class . in illustrating the range of events occurring within",
    "the c8 goes class , we uncover significant relationships existing between various physical parameters .",
    "sdo and goes observations of a sample of 17 c8 flares show strong relationships in the timings and energetics of the rise and the decay phases .",
    "we find that the duration of the rise phase is directly proportional to the decay phase time scale .",
    "additionally , we show strong scaling between radiated sxr energy and duration .",
    "the amount of energy emitted by a c8 class flare is directly proportional to its duration .",
    "this proportionality further extends to the individual rise and decay phases : e.g. the energy emitted in the rise phase is directly proportional to the duration of the rise phase .",
    "we furthermore show a proportionality between the energy radiated in the rise and decay phases : this linear scaling is observed in both broadband euv and sxr emission .",
    "we have defined the rise and decay times using the full width quarter max ( fwqm ) values of the goes 1 - 8  lightcurve ; this selection is an arbitrary distinction .",
    "the particular values used to define the flare start and end times can significantly affect both the the durations and radiated energies reported for a flare .",
    "however , we have explored alternate definitions for time periods and verified the linear scaling between rise and total times of our sample of flares .",
    "we have furthermore verified that the sxr and euv emitted energies during the rise and total duration of the flare scale linearly independent of the time definitions used .",
    "it is especially interesting to find a highly correlated energy partitioning between the rise and decay phase in both the sxr emission ( log t @xmath59 ) as well as the the euv band ( sensitive to a temperature range of log t @xmath60 5 to log t @xmath61 7 ) .",
    "eve observations of our sample flares present a very broad range of spectral signatures .",
    "for instance , 304  emission from is in some cases a dominant contributor to the emitted energy in the eve band , but its peak emission is highly uncorrelated with the total energy of the flare and ranges by more than an order of magnitude for very similar flare energies ( figure [ fig sample_eve_lcs ] ) .",
    "analogously , the peak emission in the cooler ( 2 - 4mk ) lines is very different from flare to flare and presents a large scatter .",
    "it is notable that the integrated euv behavior is fairly predictable while the behavior of individual lines varies drastically .    in considering a variety of thermal aspects of these events ,",
    "we find substantial correlations between numerous parameters .",
    "our work demonstrates that within the c8 goes class , flares with longer durations , which are generally more voluminous and have longer loop lengths , emit more total radiation . in turn , these events have lower temperatures and densities .",
    "shorter duration flares , which are smaller in geometric size and emit the least radiation , are the hottest and densest events . within this constrained goes class , these relationships have a high certainty and limited statistical dispersion .",
    "the time evolution of temperature and emission measure govern flare emission such as euv spectral radiation . through analyzing relationships between various thermal parameters ,",
    "we explain observed variations in the spectral lines of these c8 events .",
    "we show that long duration energetic events tend to have brighter and longer enduring spectral emission .",
    "these events cool down over longer periods of time .",
    "furthermore , these events tend to have prominent emission from spectral lines formed at temperatures less than log t = 7 . the hottest events , which are also the fastest evolving , tend to be dominated by spectral lines formed at higher temperatures . our investigation into relationships between the thermal properties of flares has allowed for a deeper understanding of their spectral emission .",
    "the statistics of our study would be greatly improved by a significantly larger sample .",
    "our study is impacted by the inclusion of the large filament eruption on 2012 august 31 .",
    "though this event is unique to our sample , it can not be explicitly thought of as a statistical outlier .",
    "the flare is consistent with trends present in the rest of the data . to fully explore and quantify the relationships presented in this work",
    ", a larger statistical sample is needed ; ideally a larger sample would include more of these large scale events .",
    "we have only included events which occurred after sdo data became available ; however , it would be possible to expand the portions of this study which rely solely on goes data , to include a much larger number of events ranging over solar cycles .",
