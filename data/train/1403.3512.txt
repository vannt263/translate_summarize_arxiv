    "colloidal quantum dots ( qds ) are fluorescent core - shell semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable luminescence properties ( e.g. , broad excitation spectra , narrow emission spectra , and size - dependent emission ) , which have recently attracted much attention for their ability to act as photon detectors@xcite .",
    "when a light wave strikes a metal surface , it can excite a surface - plasmon - polariton : a surface electromagnetic wave coupled to plasma oscillations .",
    "recently , the concept of plasmonics , in analogy to photonics , has received much attention since surface plasmons ( sps ) reveal strong analogies to light propagation in conventional dielectric components@xcite .",
    "for example , it is now possible to confine them to subwavelength dimensions@xcite leading to novel approaches for waveguiding below the diffraction limit@xcite .",
    "the combination of subwavelength confinement , single - mode operation , and the relatively low - power propagation loss of sp polaritons could be used to miniaturize existing photonic circuits@xcite . furthermore , the strong coupling between sp and emitters@xcite can be utilized to enhance infrared photodetectors@xcite , the fluorescence of qds@xcite , and light transmission through metal nanoarrays@xcite .",
    "high - field surface plasmon confinement was also used to demonstrate an all - optical modulator@xcite , to provide an extra degree of freedom for information storage@xcite , and to estimate the reflectivity of structures or surface roughness@xcite .    in a related context",
    ", advances in quantum information science have promoted an experimental drive for physical realizations of highly - entangled states@xcite .",
    "successes have been obtained within quantum - optical and atomic systems@xcite . however , due to scalability requirements , solid - state realizations of such phenomena are promising@xcite . furthermore ,",
    "while initial attention has been focused on the coupling between nearby qubits with local interactions@xcite , entangling arbitrary pairs of remote qubits is still an important goal .",
    "circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , for example , is one promising candidate to couple two distant qubits via a cavity bus@xcite .    motivated by these recent developments in plasmonics and quantum information science , we propose a novel scheme that can entangle two remote qds coupled to a metal nanowire .",
    "the idea is inspired by recent experiments showing single surface plasmons in metallic nanowires coupled to qds@xcite .",
    "we use a real - space hamiltonian@xcite to treat the coherent surface - plasmon transport in the wire coupled to two dots .",
    "the transmission and reflection spectra of sps for both single qd and double qds cases in the _ non - linear quadratic dispersion regime _ has been studied in our previous work@xcite . in that work",
    "the scattering spectra reveals a fano resonance due to the interference between localized and delocalized sp channels . here , we focus on the entanglement generation through the scattering of sps in _ linear dispersion relation regime_. in the limit of infinite purcell factor , @xmath0 , we find that maximally entangled states can be created if the separation between the two dots is equal to an integer multiple half - wavelength of the optical plasmon .",
    "furthermore we show the entangled state information can also be stored in metastable states , which are decoupled from the surface plasmons , by separately applying classical laser pulses to each qd . the storage efficiency of the entangled states is equal to ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a similar scheme was also recently proposed independently in ref .",
    "[ ] , who solved a similar setup using a master equation description of the two quantum dots .",
    "their findings are consistent with our results , with the maximum of the concurrence occurring at the same values of the dot distance .",
    "furthermore , they show the concurrence behavior as a function of time , for a single initial excitation , which illustrates that indeed the concurrence exists on an experimentally accessible time - scale .",
    "the approaches used are very different : we use a real - space scattering formulation , in contrast with their master equation .",
    "we stress that the reflection and transmission coefficients computed here can be directly accessed experimentally , which is not easy to do by other methods .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the important effects of ohmic loss .",
    "moreover , we propose a way to store the entanglement produced in this manner .",
    "when a colloidal semiconductor qd is placed close to a metal nanowire , a strong coupling between the qd exciton and sp can occur@xcite , as in traditional cavity qed@xcite . as shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "the system we consider here is composed of two nominally identical qds , both with energy spacing @xmath2 , separated a distance @xmath3 , near a cylindrical metal nanowire .",
    "we assume that a surface plasmon emitted from a source qd is incident from the left with energy @xmath4 . here ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the group velocity and wavevector of the incident sp , respectively .",
    "since the sp is propagating on the surface of the metal nanowire , it inevitably suffers from dissipation ( such as ohmic loss ) . as a result",
    ", the source of the incoming plasmon ( e.g. an additional qd ) must be placed close to the first qd to minimize the initial losses ( i.e. those which occur before the plasmon reaches the two - dot region ) .",
    "we also propose a practical way to further minimize all the dissipation affects in the next section .",
    "the dissipation terms are included as an imaginary energy in the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian  @xcite , which can be written as @xmath7\\sigma _ { e_{j},e_{j}}+\\int dk~\\hbar v_{\\textrm{g}}|k|a_{k}^{\\dag }",

    "we can include the ohmic loss of plasmons during the scattering process in this way because a loss of the plasmon is equivalent to a lose of the excitation in the quantum dots .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 is the detuning between the incident sp energy with @xmath20 and the qd exciton energy @xmath21 .",
    "the validity of this non - hermitian form relies on the fact that @xmath22 is small and that we only consider one excitation .",
    "hence we do not need to consider the effect of the quantum jump terms one usually needs for a full description of the system@xcite .",
    "however , this implies that there is a certain time scale of decay of the highly - entangled state into other modes , even if they are not emitted into the surface - plasmonic environment ( though typically the purcell factor is large , so emission into sps will dominate any decay process ) .",
    "this reinforces the need to transfer the fragile entangled state to a metastable state .",
    "since we are only interested in the case where the incident sp is nearly - resonant with the two qds , we can rewrite @xmath23 as @xmath24 and @xmath25 as @xmath26 . transforming eq .",

    "this is the only real contribution the super - radiance term makes to our results .",
    "its effect on the entanglement , discussed in the next section , diminishes quickly as a function of @xmath3 , thus we omit it completely in that treatment ( see methods ) .",

    "this makes the two qds collectively act like a single qd and results in an identical spectrum to the single qd case@xcite .",

    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) oppositely imply that if there is no transmission or reflection sp detected at the two ends of the wire , the wavefunction is projected onto the state @xmath83 this means that it is possible to create entanglement between the two dots .",
    "however , this projection , or post - selection , requires minimal ohmic loss .",
    "this can be mitigated using the meta - stable states and waveguides discussed in the next section .",
    "let us first consider the limit of @xmath0 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "two special cases for achieving high entanglement are @xmath56 and @xmath85 , for which the amplitude @xmath86 is equal to @xmath87 or @xmath88 , respectively . in this case , the two - dot qubits become triplet- or singlet - entangled if no surface plasmons are detected at the two ends of the wire .    to demonstrate the degree of entanglement , fig .",

    ", we can neglect the effect of super - radiance and find that the equation of these curved regions are given by @xmath93 the physical meaning of this condition is that even if the energy for the incident sp is not resonant with the qubit energy @xmath94 , it is still possible to create a highly - entangled state , but only if the two dots are placed at the right locations . in this case",

    "however , the scattering treatment we use here does not truly reflect the dynamics of the coupled system : in reality , it takes a finite time for the plasmon to mediate the entanglement between the two dots . during this finite time",
    ", the entangled state will undergo decoherence ,",
    "even if no plasmon is emitted to the left or right . thus this ",
    "high entanglement \" value will , in practice , be reduced ( e.g. , by emission of the qds into other modes ) .    for finite purcell factor @xmath105",
    ", the entanglement between the two qds will be suppressed by the dissipation ( @xmath22 ) . in the absence of further emission of a surface plasmon ( e.g. because of ideal post - selection , or transfer to the metastable state ,",
    "see next section ) the entangled state will decay exponentially due to the losses into free space @xmath17 .",
    "this behavior is trivial , so we do not show it here .",
    "all of this implies the creation of the entangled state truly depends on @xmath63 dominating over the all decay channels ( which is feasible  @xcite ) , and fast transfer of the entangled state into a metastable state .",
    "we discuss this in the next section .",
    ", with classical optical pulses @xmath106 and @xmath107 . to avoid the possibility of strong losses in metal nano - wires , a dielectric waveguide is introduced to achieve remote entanglement . in the three - level diagram , the subscript @xmath10 ( @xmath108 or @xmath109 ) labels each qd . ]    one might argue that the entangled states created in this manner are fragile because the qds are still coupled to the sps .",
    "the entanglement would rapidly disappear either due to radiative or non - radiative losses or the sp would eventually escape and be detected ( or lost during propagation in the nano - wire ) .",
    "the entangled state exists only on a very short time - scale ( see appendix b for further discussions on this time - scale ) . to overcome this",
    ", one can consider multilevel emitters , such as the three - level configuration@xcite shown in fig .",
    "metastable@xcite states , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , are decoupled from the sps , but are resonantly coupled to @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , via a classical optical control field with rabi frequencies @xmath106 and @xmath114 . here , the metastable states mean that the relaxation times of the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 are much longer than that of the excited states @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "three remarks about experimental realizations should be addressed here .",
    "first , for the realization of the coupling between a metal nanowire sp and the two qds , colloidal cdse / zns qds and a silver nanowire are ideal since the exciton energy of cdse / zns qds is around 2 - 2.5 ev , compatible with the saturation plasma energy@xcite ( @xmath119 2.66 ev ) of the silver nanowire .",
    "second , the sps inevitably experience losses as they propagate along the nanowire , which limits the feasibility of creating remote entanglement .",
    "one solution to this problem would be to couple the two dots to two separate nanowires , as shown in fig .",
    "also , the wires are evanescently coupled to a phase - matched dielectric waveguide@xcite . in this case",
    ", one can have both the advantages of strong coupling to the sps , and long - distance transport through the dielectric waveguide .",
    "third , once the entangled state has been prepared , how can it be detected ?",
    "one possible procedure is to use ultra - fast optical tomography as outlined in ref .",
    "[ ] . this would allow to reconstruct the density matrix of the effective two - dot ( qubit ) system ( which in practice will be a mixed state due to environmental effects , and the inevitable decay of the meta - stable states ) , and consequently obtain the concurrence of the two dots .",
    "in summary , we have examined the scattering properties of the sps in a metal nanowire coupled with two qds .",
    "both the dissipative losses and the super - radiant effect are found to influence the scattering properties .",
    "we then used this system to propose a scheme to create a remote entangled state between the two qds . using metastable states and waveguides",
    "this might be possible even in the presence of metal and radiative losses . in future work",
    "one could consider how the presence of entanglement could be tested with the bell inequality by scattering another plasmon off the entangled two - dot state and performing scattering measurements akin to those proposed for edge states in quantum hall systems@xcite .",
    "in addition , this proposal can also be applied to other physical systems .",
    "for example , one can easily extend this to photons ( e.g. , in transmission lines or waveguides ) coupled to qubits ( e.g. , superconducting qubit)@xcite .",

    "the inclusion of the super - radiant term in the non - hermitian form can be justified as follows .",
    "one can start with a master equation for the two qds coupled to external modes or with a simple application of fermi s golden rule ( e.g. , as in ref . [ ] ) . in the singlet , @xmath120 , and triplet , @xmath121 , bases this master equation has several super - radiant and sub - radiant decay terms , describing the following decay channels : via rate @xmath122 for the channel @xmath123 ; and via the rate @xmath124 for the channel @xmath125 .",
    "since we omit the double - occupation terms here , only the channels from @xmath126 and @xmath127 contribute .",

    "quantum jump \" term .",

    "<S> we investigate coherent single surface - plasmon transport in a metal nanowire strongly coupled to two colloidal quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> analytical expressions are obtained for the transmission and reflection coefficients by solving the corresponding eigenvalue equation . </S>",
    "<S> remote entanglement of the wave functions of the two quantum dots can be created if the inter - dot distance is equal to a multiple half - wavelength of the surface plasmon . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by applying classical laser pulses to the quantum dots , the entangled states can be stored in metastable states which are decoupled from the surface plasmons . </S>"
