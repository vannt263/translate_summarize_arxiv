    "quantum information processing is an active and fascinating direction of research with participation from various fields of physics and neighboring scientific disciplines  @xcite .",
    "this extraordinary interest has generated a fairly vast amount of theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "possible experimental realizations of quantum information processing are presently being investigated . among the different approaches ,",
    "those in a solid state setting are attractive , because they offer the potential of scalability  the integration of a large number of quantum gates into a quantum computer once the individual gates and qubits are established . with that in mind ,",
    "several proposals for using electron and/or nuclear spins in solid state systems have been put forward in recent years  @xcite .",
    "specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to use the spin of electrons residing in semiconductor quantum dots as qubits @xcite . in this paper",
    "we revisit the quantum dynamics of gate operations between qubits of this type .",
    "such two - qubit operations are performed by varying the amplitude of electron tunneling between the dots via external electric potentials . in a generic scenario ,",
    "the tunneling amplitude between the dots is zero ( or , more precisely , exponentially small ) before and after the gate operation , while it is finite and appreciable during such a process .",
    "thus , the typical time dependence of the tunneling amplitude is a pulse roughly characterized by its duration , amplitude , and ramp time ( see figure [ shape ] . ) during such a pulse , the tunneling amplitude is finite and essentially constant , and both electrons can explore the total two quantum dot system . therefore , their indistinguishable fermionic character is of relevance @xcite . in particular , in such gate operations",
    "entanglement - like quantum correlations arise which require a description different from the usual entanglement between distinguishable parties ( alice , bob ,  ... ) in bipartite ( or multipartite ) systems .",
    "in such a case the proper statistics of the indistinguishable particles has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of having a finite ( as opposed to infinitely high ) tunneling barrier between the dots is that it necessarily leads to ( partially ) doubly occupied states in the two - electron wave function , i.e. contributions to the wave function where both electrons are on the same dot ( having different spin ) occur with finite amplitude .",
    "doubly occupied states which arise as the result of a measurement _ after _ the gate operation , destroy the information in those qubits and lead to errors in the information processing .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to reduce the probability of such errors , i.e. the occurrence of doubly occupied states , in the resulting two - electron state _",
    "after _ the gate operation , while it is necessarily finite during the operation @xcite .",
    "if the error probability can be sufficiently reduced , error events can be tolerable and handled with quantum error correction schemes .",
    "an effective way of guaranteeing error suppression is to maintain nearly adiabatic time evolution .",
    "doubly occupied states then correspond to corrections to adiabatic evolution , which are often called `` non - adiabatic transitions '' .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have shown that the adiabatic region , in terms of the pulse parameters such as ramp time and amplitude , is rather large . on a heuristic level , this numerical result is plausible on the basis of the classic papers on adiabatic quantum motion in two - level systems by landau  @xcite , zener  @xcite , stueckelberg  @xcite , and rosen and zener  @xcite . for an overview see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the quantum dynamics of the two - qubit gate operations described above and use dykhne s semiclassical result to estimate the probability of non - adiabatic transition  @xcite .",
    "the applicability of dykhne s formula is analyzed from the standpoint of the theory of semiclassical approximations .",
    "these semiclassical estimates are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the exact time evolution .",
    "moreover , in a certain limit our model is integrable , allowing us to explicitly calculate and interpret the corrections to dykhne s formula .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the derivation   of an effective two - level model . in section 3",
    ", we present our main result  the asymptotic estimate of double occupancy , which in section 4 is compared with an integrable model and a numerical integration of the schrdinger equation . in the appendix",
    ", we construct the scattering matrix for the integrable model , which has three independent parameters .",
    "for the purpose of studying double occupancy it is practical to examine the dynamics of the quantum gate operation in a subspace spanned by singly and doubly occupied states .",
    "following ref .   with only minor changes of notation ,",
    "we now detail how to reduce the description of a system of two coupled quantum dot spin qubits to an effective two - level hamiltonian .",
    "the system is described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the coulomb repulsion between the electrons , and @xmath2 is the single - particle part with @xmath3 the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath4 describes electron dynamics confined to the @xmath5-plane in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 . the effective mass @xmath7 is a material dependent parameter .",
    "the coupling of the dots ( which includes tunneling ) is modeled by a quartic potential @xmath8 which separates into two harmonic wells of frequency @xmath9 ( one for each dot ) in the limit @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is half the distance between the dots and @xmath12 is the effective bohr radius of a dot .",
    "following burkard _",
    "@xcite we employ the hund - mulliken method of molecular orbits to describe the low - lying spectrum of our system .",
    "this approach concentrates on the lowest orbital states in each dot and is an extension of the heitler - london method @xcite .",
    "the hund - mulliken approach accounts for the fact that both electrons can , in the presence of a finite tunneling amplitude , explore the entire system of the two dots , and therefore adequately includes the possibility of doubly occupied states . in the usual symmetric gauge",
    "@xmath13 the fock - darwin ground state of a single dot with harmonic confinement centered around @xmath14 reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the magnetic length , and the frequency @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the usual larmor frequency . from these non - orthogonal single - particle states we construct the orthonormalized states @xmath20 and @xmath21 with wave functions @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the overlap between the states ( [ dotstates ] ) and @xmath24 . for appropriate values of system parameters such as the interdot distance and the external magnetic field ,",
    "the overlap @xmath23 becomes exponentially small @xcite . in this limit",
    "an electron in one of the states @xmath20 , @xmath21 is predominantly localized around @xmath14 . in the following",
    "we consider this case and use these states as basis states to define qubits , i.e. qubits are realized by the spin state of an electron in either orbital @xmath20 , or orbital @xmath21 .",
    "an appropriate basis set for the six - dimensional two - particle hilbert space is given ( using standard notation ) by the three spin singlets @xmath25 and the triplet multiplet , @xmath26 where we have defined @xmath27 and the expectation value of coulomb energy @xmath28    an important further observation is that , as a consequence of inversion symmetry along the axis connecting the dots , the hamiltonian does not have any non - zero matrix elements between the singlet state @xmath29 and other states .",
    "hence , @xmath29 is , independently of the system parameters , an eigenstate .",
    "the eigenvalues of the triplet and @xmath29 , however , do depend on system parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian acting on the remaining space spanned by @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 the nontrivial part of ( [ 2ham ] ) is a simple hubbard hamiltonian on two sites and can be identified as the hamiltonian of a pseudospin-@xmath35 object in a pseudomagnetic field having a component @xmath36 in the @xmath37-direction and @xmath38 in the @xmath39-direction of pseudospin space .",
    "[ note that this pseudospin is not related to the spin degree of freedom which constitutes the qubit ! ] the basis states themselves are eigenstates only in the case of vanishing tunneling amplitude @xmath40 where @xmath30 is the ground state and @xmath31 is a higher lying state due of the coulomb ( hubbard ) energy . in all other cases ,",
    "the ground state has an admixture of doubly occupied states contained in @xmath31 .",
    "the energy gap between the triplet and the singlet ground state is @xmath41    a key challenge for state - of - the - art quantum information processing is the construction of systems composed of two coupled quantum dots which can be coupled to perform swap operations @xmath42 , i.e. unitary two - qubit operations which interchange the spin states ( qubits ) of the electrons on the two dots . by combining the `` square root '' @xmath43 of such a swap with other isolated - qubit manipulations one can construct a quantum xor gate .",
    "a quantum xor gate , along with isolated - qubit operations , has been shown to be sufficient for the implementation of any quantum algorithm @xcite .",
    "hence a practical and reliable realization of a swap gate would be an important step toward the fabrication of a solid state quantum computer .",
    "a swap operation in the present system is a unitary transformation which turns a state having the qubits in different states , say , @xmath44 into a state where the contents of the qubits are interchanged , @xmath45 these two states are eigenstates in the case @xmath46 and @xmath47 for which the singlet - triplet splitting vanishes .",
    "as discussed in references @xcite , swapping may be achieved by the action of a gate that lowers the potential barrier between the quantum dots .",
    "this leads to exponentially larger values for both @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is adequate for our purposes to consider a model where @xmath46 ( consistent with the above limit of small overlap @xmath23 ) , and the singlet - triplet splitting results entirely from @xmath49 . if the duration and amplitude of a tunneling pulse is adjusted appropriately , the relative dynamical phase between the singlet and the triplet state accumulates a shift of @xmath50 , _",
    "-^ t _ ( t ) - _ ( t ) = [ constraint ] and the swapping operation between states ( [ instate ] ) and ( [ outstate ] ) is performed . however , during the operation the state @xmath51 is coupled to @xmath52 , and they evolve according to ( [ 2ham ] ) .",
    "double occupancy errors are thus generically introduced .",
    "the reduction of the dynamics to the time evolution of a two - level system relies on the fact that the system has inversion symmetry along the @xmath39-axis in real space connecting the dots .",
    "this symmetry can be broken if odd powers of the particle coordinates @xmath53 are added to the hamiltonian ( [ opham ] ) , for example the potential of a homogeneous electric field .",
    "the breaking of inversion symmetry introduces additional matrix elements between @xmath29 and the other two singlets leading to an effective three level hamiltonian .",
    "however , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this more inclusive hamiltonian has qualitatively the same properties concerning non - adiabatic dynamics as the two - level system on which we shall concentrate in the following .",
    "so far we have not considered a possible zeeman coupling to the electron spin .",
    "this would not change the situation essentially since all states involved in the swapping process ( @xmath54 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and possibly @xmath29 ) have the total spin quantum number @xmath55 .",
    "in this section we use dykhne s formula for non - adiabatic transitions to derive an asymptotic expression for the probability of final double occupancy , given physically motivated properties of the two - qubit operation .",
    "as described in the previous section , the modulation of the tunneling barrier during the swapping process induces a coupling between the singly occupied qubit state @xmath56 and the doubly occupied state @xmath57 .",
    "their dynamics are governed by the effective hamiltonian    _ = - (    cc 1 & t_h + t_h & -1    ) [ h1 ] in the @xmath58 basis .",
    "the terms omitted from ( [ 2ham ] ) do not contribute to transitions , because the identity operator in the @xmath58 basis commutes with the remainder of the hamiltonian .",
    "the large energy offset @xmath59 between singly and doubly occupied states , primarily due to the coulomb repulsion , is perturbed only by an exponentially small additive quantity ( proportional to the overlap , @xmath23 ) during the swapping operation and is hereafter assumed to be a constant .",
    "our specification of the pulse ( figure [ shape ] ) t_h(t ) = [ pulse ] with dimensionless strength @xmath60 is considered to realistically reflect the tunneling amplitude that would arise from a modulation of the gate potential  .",
    "the exponential dependence of the ramping near @xmath61 has its origin in the exponential sensitivity of the coupling to the gate voltage and in turn the exponential decay of the single - particle wavefunctions ( [ dotstates ] ) in the inter - dot region  .",
    "the pulse mimics a step of duration @xmath62 and magnitude @xmath63 , whose ramping on and off have a characteristic time @xmath64 .",

    "our task is to find the component of double occupancy in the final state , @xmath67 , given that the prepared state is purely singly occupied , @xmath68 .",
    "our model involves three dimensionless scales , assigned for our purposes as follows : @xmath60 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "presently , the case of interest is 1 1 .",
    "[ lims ] the first of these conditions reflects the adiabaticity of the problem .",
    "the second requires that the ramping on and ramping off of the pulse be temporally well - separated and distinct events .",
    "let us pause and for this paragraph review the familiar notions of transitions under the action of a time dependent perturbation .",
    "the pulse acts as a transient perturbation and otherwise the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is diagonal . by force of the adiabatic theorem",
    ", the probability of transition among eigenstates vanishes in the limit @xmath71 , where the ramping on and off of the pulse is adiabatic . in the zeroth order of adiabatic perturbation theory ,",

    ", the zeroth order approximation should also include a factor representing berry s phase .",
    "however , for a real symmetric hamiltonian such as ( [ h1 ] ) , berry s phase is irrelevant , because the hamiltonian has an inherent planarity . in pseudospin",
    "one - half notation , @xmath73 , the time evolution of the pseudomagnetic field @xmath74 is in a plane .",
    "if the azimuthal axis ( north pole ) is chosen to lie within that plane , the solid angle subtended by the pseudomagnetic field vanishes identically .",
    "although berry s phase is out of consideration , there are interesting circumstances where berry s phase is relevant to transitions .",
    "it can correct the transition amplitude @xcite and produce topological selection rules for spin tunneling @xcite .",
    "our problem is one of a class initiated by the work of landau , zener , and stueckelberg ( lsz ) @xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize that for our model ( with the pulse specified as ( [ pulse ] ) ) the linearization of hamiltonian matrix elements near the times where adiabaticity is most severely violated is not applicable and leads to an incorrect result . as we will see the shape of the pulse is important .      returning to our model",

    "the calculation of non - adiabatic transitions is closely related to the semiclassical approximation @xcite , because the semiclassical limit @xmath121 can be mathematically equivalent to the adiabatic limit @xmath71 .",
    "an essential element of the proof by hwang and pechukas is the existence of a complex time contour that 1 ) connects the two sheets of the riemann surface and 2 ) on which the zeroth order approximation of adiabatic perturbation theory is the correct leading behavior of the solution in the adiabatic limit .",
