    "rayleigh - bnard convection  @xcite , which consists of a thin horizontal fluid layer uniformly heated from below and uniformly cooled from above , is a simplified version to study the complexities of thermal convection .",
    "the convection in a boussinesq fluid is governed by two nonlinearities : the self - interaction of the velocity field @xmath20 and the advection of temperature by the velocity field @xmath21 .",
    "proctor  @xcite suggested two different flow regimes for the convection near the instability onset in low - prandtl - number fluids : the inertial and the viscous regimes .",
    "if @xmath20 is nonzero but compensated by the pressure gradient , the flow dynamics is described by the nonlinear term @xmath22 .",
    "the convective heat flux ( @xmath23 ) across the fluid layer could be large and independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding convection is said to be in the inertial regime .",
    "if the convective heat flux is small and @xmath24 , the corresponding convection is said to be in the viscous regime .",

    "the nonlinear term @xmath22 is neglected in this limit , and the thermal convection is described by the term @xmath20 .",
    "this limit is therefore the viscous regime of convection .",
    "the only nonlinearity @xmath20 is unable to saturate two - dimensional ( 2d ) rolls , as the 2d growing rolls become the exact nonlinear solution with _ stress - free _ horizontal boundaries .",
    "this makes the @xmath25 limit with stress - free boundary conditions a singular limit .",
    "thual  @xcite showed the saturation of thermal convection in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of three - dimensional ( 3d ) flows in this limit with stress - free boundaries .",

    "lopez and marques  @xcite investigated the effects of centrifugal force on fluid flow in detail . the coriolis force linearly couples the vertical velocity and the vertical vorticity .",
    "this delays the onset of rayleigh - bnard convection  @xcite , affects the heat flux  @xcite across the fluid layer , and breaks the mirror - symmetry of the convective flow even at small rotation rates .",

    "is raised above @xmath165 , the merged chaotic solution spontaneous break into one of four possible limit cycles ( periodic solution ) , each shown in a different color .",
    "this happens when the loops made by chaotic trajectories just touch the square saddle fixed points .",
    "this represents an inverse heteroclinic bifurcation . after this bifurcation , each limit cycle",
    "is confined to only one quadrant of the @xmath144 plane .",
    "there is a transition from irregular bursting of patterns to regular bursting of patterns .",
    "bajaj et al .",
    "@xcite had also reported the periodic bursting of fluid patterns in their experiments in low - prandtl - number fluids with rotation .",
    "each limit cycle is closer to only one of of the four saddle square fixed points .",
    "this minimum - mode model is not good enough to capture dynamical behaviour away from the onset .",
    "bifurcation diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ r_ta_space ] based on model - i shows that the increase in @xmath39 at a fixed value of @xmath3 in certain range leads to homoclinic merging ( ocr - i solution ) .",
    "the projection of the phase space in the @xmath198 plane ( fig .  [ bifurcation_model2 ] ) explains the exponential growth of one of 2d roll modes ( @xmath139 and @xmath139 ) to a large value followed by sudden fall to zero value . for @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) , all the points on the @xmath139 and @xmath139 axes are fixed points for smaller values of @xmath3 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the origin represents the conduction state , while other fixed points represent 2d rolls .",
    "as @xmath39 is raised slightly above unity , all these fixed points become unstable . in addition , four saddle fixed points describing unstable square patterns ( blue squares ) and eight saddle foci describing unstable cross - rolls patterns ( dots in different colors ) are generated .",
    "the four saddle fixed points surround the origin , while a pair of saddle foci are located very closely on two sides of any axis in positive as well as negative directions .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds of these fixed points now decide the dynamics of any trajectory in the phase space .",
    "for example , a pair of saddle foci on the two sides of the positive @xmath140 axis guide any trajectory starting near origin on this axis to keep moving on the axis in the positive direction to a large positive value .",
    "as soon as it crosses a critical values , the vertical vorticity is excited through nonlinearity .",
    "this transfers the energy of energy from 2d roll mode @xmath140 to another 2d mode @xmath139 in a very short time .",
    "the trajectory then moves away from the @xmath140 axis , makes a loop around the unstable cross - roll fixed point and returns near the origin on the @xmath139 axis .",
    "the rolls patterns parallel to the @xmath201 axis disappears and a new set of rolls parallel to the @xmath202 axis stars growing .",
    "the trajectories form , depending upon the value of @xmath3 , either an open but bounded or a closed heteroclinic orbit .",
    "they correspond to irregular ( chaotic ) or regular ( periodic ) bursting of patterns .",
    "as observed in dns and model - i , the orbit may become either an open or a closed homoclinic orbit for @xmath203 ( see fig .",
    "[ phase_portrait ] ) near onset .",
    "we have investigated the convective patterns at primary instability using direct numerical simulations in zero - prandtl - number rayleigh - bnard convection with uniform rotation .",
    "the direct numerical simulations have been done in the viscous regime with stress - free boundary conditions .",
    "the convective patterns at the instability onset are found to be time - dependent in this limit .",
    "the phenomenon of bursting of fluid patterns has been observed at the onset for small values of @xmath204 in a simulation box with square horizontal cross - section ( @xmath5 ) with each side @xmath205 .",
    "bursts of large - amplitude convection appeared and then disappeared in mutually perpendicular directions .",
    "the bursting of patterns occurs at irregular intervals for certain windows of @xmath3 ( @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) , while it occurs at a regular interval in some other windows of @xmath3 ( @xmath208 and @xmath209 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath39 at a fixed value of @xmath3 ( @xmath210 ) leads to a series of interesting fluid patterns : merging of two limit cycles ( oscillating cross - rolls , ocr - i ) , spontaneous breaking of the merged limit cycle into one of the possible smaller limit cycles ( ocr - ii ) , stationary cross - rolls , and stationary squares .",
    "the pattern dynamics at the onset is different in rectangular simulation boxes .",
    "periodic wavy rolls are observed at the onset for lower values of @xmath3 , while kl patterns are observed at moderate values of @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "there is a transition from to gkl patterns near a bicritical point . in larger simulation boxes with rectangular horizontal cross - section ( @xmath38 ) , kl pattern",
    "are observed near onset even at smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "the kppers - lortz patterns ( kl and gkl ) also show irregular bursting occasionally .",
    "temporally quasiperiodic patterns are observed in the oscillatory regime ( @xmath211 ) for @xmath5 and @xmath165 . in the oscillatory regime ( @xmath211 ) near a bicritical point ( @xmath212 ) , temporally quasiperiodic or chaotic cross - rolls ( @xmath213 ) have been observed for @xmath214 and @xmath165 .",
    "they do not show the phenomenon of bursting of patterns .",
    "we have also presented two low - dimensional models for a square simulation box ( @xmath5 ) . a twenty - mode model ( model - i ) captures the sequence of secondary and higher - order instabilities qualitatively well for @xmath215 at smaller rotation rates ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "the model clearly reveals the origin of bursting .",
    "when the amplitude of a set of rolls exceeds a large critical value , the vertical vorticity modes are nonlinearly excited .",
    "the bursting involves a nonlocal bifurcation at the primary instability for smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "this also shows a new possibility of large variation of the roll amplitude at a supercritical bifurcation .",
    "increasing @xmath39 leads to a series of interesting instabilities including inverse homoclinic , inverse hopf and inverse pitchfork bifurcations .",
    "the model also captures the sequence of bifurcations qualitatively at the primary instability as @xmath3 is varied .",
    "the model also shows the possibility interesting bifurcations as the parameter @xmath217 is varied keeping @xmath3 , @xmath39 and @xmath2 fixed .",
    "it shows the possibility of stationary cross - rolls for @xmath218 and stationary square patterns for @xmath219 .",
    "this suggests that selection of convective patterns near the onset in rotating convection may be significantly influenced by the size of the horizontal cross - section of the container .",
    "the model shows stationary patterns instead of kppers - lortz patterns at the onset by varying the horizontal cross - section slightly with fixed values of all other parameters .",
    "this type of model would be useful to understand the unfolding of bifurcations near a bicritical point . a minimum - mode model ( model - ii ) , effective just above the onset and for @xmath169 shows interesting dynamics .",
    "the model shows heteroclinic chaotic solutions , merging of heteroclinic chaotic solutions , and spontaneous breaking of the merged chaotic solution into a limit cycle solution at the primary instability for @xmath169 .",
    "we benefited from fruitful discussions with pinaki pal , hirdesh k. pharasi , arnab basak , and deepesh kumar ."
