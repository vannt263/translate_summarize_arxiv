    "the next generation of low - background physics experiments , including direct detection of weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter may provide significant insight to physics beyond the standard model and the nature of the dominant matter constituent of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the successful detection of wimps will provide valuable information about the nature of dark matter .",
    "several current and next generation large - scale detectors designed to search for wimp dark matter make use of liquified noble gas ( ne , ar , xe ) .",
    "descriptions of several experiments of this type may be found in refs.@xcite .",

    "neutrons having energies less than about 10 mev may be produced in such experiments via alpha particles produced in decays of @xmath2u and @xmath3th in the detector and surrounding materials that undergo @xmath4 reactions .",
    "one particular site of these reactions is in borosilicate photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) glass , because the @xmath5b@xmath6n cross section is considerably larger than @xmath4 cross - section data for other typical detector and shielding materials .",
    "pmts are a common technology for detecting scintillation light in these noble - gas detectors .",
    "neutron - induced nuclear recoils are a particularly dangerous background for these experiments , since they can mimic wimp events .    the deap / clean experimental program uses large volumes of liquid argon or neon to search for wimps from the scintillation channel only  @xcite .",
    "both materials show excellent scintillation properties and make use of pulse - shape discrimination to separate electron and nuclear recoils  @xcite .",
    "the lack of elastic scattering cross - section measurements for neutrons in argon and neon poses a problem for background estimates , performed primarily via monte carlo calculations .",
    "precise differential neutron scattering cross sections are required to determine the background contribution due to neutrons in these experiments .",
    "both total and differential cross sections for elastic scattering are important for dark matter experiments , as the rate of multiple scattering inside the detector s sensitive volume is determined by the angular differential cross section .",
    "neutrons that multiple scatter can be cut using event - reconstruction techniques , but calibrations and monte carlo simulations using known cross sections are required to determine the efficacy of these analysis cuts .",
    "we have performed measurements and optical - model fits for the neutron elastic scattering cross section for neon at @xmath7 = 5.0 and 8.0 mev and for argon at @xmath8 = 6.0 mev for use as inputs to quantitative estimates of neutron backgrounds in these experiments .",
    "these neutron energies were determined by where the @xmath2u and @xmath3th induced @xmath9neutron yields are the largest in boron @xcite .",
    "these measurements also provide additional data to benchmark the optical model in a nuclear mass where the model is not well constrained , and will enhance nuclear databases .",
    "the neutron time - of - flight ( ntof ) facility at the triangle universities nuclear laboratory ( tunl )  @xcite , located on the campus of duke university , in durham , nc , usa was used to measure the neutron elastic scattering cross section of argon and neon .",

    "typical deuteron beam current on target for this experiment was about 1.0 @xmath12a .",
    "the deuterium gas cell pressure ( 4.0 atm for @xmath8 = 5.0 and 6.0 mev , and 7.8 atm for @xmath8 = 8.0 mev ) was chosen to minimize the energy spread in the neutron beam caused by energy loss of the incident deuterons due to ionization in the gas while producing an adequate neutron flux on target to carry out these measurements .",
    "the choice of gas pressure allowed a neutron energy spread of about 400 kev .",
    "the scattering samples were suspended from thin steel wires located about 10 cm from the neutron production cell and were aligned with the beam line .",
    "the gas target cell is described fully in ref.@xcite .",
    "the cell was a 21.0-mm diameter stainless steel sphere with 0.5-mm wall thickness .",
    "it was filled with 99.999% natural neon or natural argon using a coupling device connected to a high - pressure filling station at tunl .",
    "the measurements were carried out with the cell pressurized to 170 atm absolute , which corresponds to a steel - to - gas ratio of about 4-to-1 by mass and is well below the maximum pressure rating of 550 atm .",
    "the achievable pressure was limited by the ability to condense the gas in the cell at the filling station .",
    "the number of nuclei in the cell was determined by measuring the mass to 0.01 mg accuracy before and after filling .",
    "the pressure in the cell was stable , with no measurable difference during the experimental runs , sometimes up to 48 hours .",
