    "electron beam induced deposition ( ebid ) has emerged as a promising technique to make nanostructures in a size , shape and position - controlled manner without the use of any expensive masks @xcite .",
    "deposits with the desired metal content and electronic properties can be obtained either directly by tuning the preparation conditions ( varying the electron beam energy ) or by post - fabrication techniques ( heating or further irradiation ) .",
    "thus fabrication of materials with new physical and chemical properties at the nanoscale has been successfully achieved @xcite .",
    "transition metal carbides possess unique physical and chemical properties that have made them promising materials in several industrial and electronic applications .",
    "the composition of tungsten granular deposits obtained by decomposing w(co)@xmath0 as a precursor in the ebid process indicates that the tungsten atoms are embedded in a carbon ( and oxygen ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "although investigations on the microstructure and the electrical transport properties have shed some light on the behavior of these systems , a deep microscopic understanding is still missing .",
    "several theoretical studies are available on the structural and electronic properties of @xmath1 and @xmath2 transition metal carbides  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , studies on metal oxycarbides are scarce due to the lack of knowledge on their structures .",
    "the high level of carbon and oxygen concentrations up to an average of 30 - 40% in the ebid - fabricated samples indicates that a good description of the electronic structure of these metal oxycarbides may be obtained by suitably guessing approximate structures from the well - known crystal structures of tungsten carbides and tungsten oxides .",
    "this methodology indeed has been successful in predicting the structure of pt@xmath3si@xmath4 derived from pt@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a similar procedure for tungsten oxycarbides has been adapted by suetin _",
    "et al . _ , who investigated the structure , electronic and magnetic properties of some tungsten oxycarbides by constructing approximate crystal structures obtained from systematically replacing the carbon by oxygen in the hexagonal structure of wc and oxygen by carbon in the cubic structure wo@xmath4 @xcite",
    "however , a powerful evolutionary algorithm was recently proposed which in principle can predict the crystal structure of materials with any atomic composition and is not biased by the choice of initially known crystal structure settings  @xcite .    in the present work we use this evolutionary algorithm to predict structures of approximants representing amorphous tungsten oxycarbides as obtained by the ebid process using periodic boundary conditions ( i.e.",

    ", we find an insulator to metal transition at a composition close to the composition where experimentally such a transition has been observed @xcite .",
    "we further show that the calculated x - ray diffraction patterns ( xrd ) for our structures correlate very well with the patterns measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "we approximated the amorphous tungsten oxycarbides structures obtained in the ebid process by large unit cells that can account for the local structural environment present in the experimental compositions . in order to predict these structures , we employed evolutionary algorithms developed by a. oganov _",
    "et al . _ featuring local optimization , real - space representation and flexible physically motivated variation operators  @xcite .",
    "each generation contained between 20 and 40 structures and the first generation was always produced randomly .",
    "three different sets of calculation have been performed for each composition with differing number of initial populations and varying slightly the parameter ( fracperm ) that controls the percentage of structures obtained by heredity and permutation . with all these different sets of calculation ,",
    "2000 structures were screened for each composition .",
    "all structures were locally optimized during structure search using density functional theory ( dft ) with the projector augmented wave ( paw )  @xcite as implemented in vasp  @xcite .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the parametrization of perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite was used as approximation for the exchange and correlation functional .",
    "the reported structures are the ones with the lowest enthalpy ; the evolutionary algorithm was considered converged when the lowest enthalpy structure could nt be improved during eight generations.@xcite we analyzed the electronic structure of the resulting structures using the full potential local orbital ( fplo ) basis  @xcite .",

    "we find a very good agreement between the main peak observed experimentally at 4  nm@xmath28 and the peaks in the predicted diffraction patterns .",
    "this peak corresponds to bond lengths of 2.5   and should be related to tungsten bonds as the light elements contribute only insignificantly to the electron diffraction intensity at 300  kev .",
    "thus , we can relate the electron diffraction pattern to the pair correlation functions of figs .",
    "[ fig : pc1 ] and [ fig : pc2 ] and conclude that the w - w bonds most likely cause the electron diffraction peak observed experimentally .",

    ", we find very good agreement with the experimental observations ; an insulator - to - metal transition is observed at a concentration close to the experimental concentration at which this transition is reported and we explain the prominent peak observed in micro - raman spectroscopy as caused by w - w bonds .    the use of genetic algorithms to predict and simulate amorphous nanodeposits opens the possibility to understand the microscopic origin of the behavior of these systems .",
