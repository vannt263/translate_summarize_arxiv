    "in many phenomena of relativistic astrophysics , such as agn , grbs , quasars , radio galaxies , micro - quasars , pulsars and magnetars , compact x - ray binaries etc . , the magnetic field is a key dynamic component . on one hand , the magnetic field drives , accelerates and partially collimates relativistic outflows from astrophysical black holes , neutron stars , and their accretion disks . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic reconnection and dissipation is responsible for bright thermal and non - thermal emission from these flows .",
    "recent years have seen a remarkable progress in numerical methods for ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamics @xcite and many interesting and important simulations have been carried out already . quite often the numerical solutions exhibited violent magnetic reconnection .",
    "although it is indeed very likely to occur in the considered astrophysical phenomena as the result of non - vanishing physical resistivity of plasma , both collisional and collisionless , the reconnection observed in the simulations is of purely numerical origin .",
    "it is driven by artificial resistivity arising due to truncation errors and hence fully depending on fine details of numerical schemes and resolution .",
    "a code for resistive rmhd would allow to control magnetic reconnection according to the incorporated physical models of resistivity .",
    "moreover , the relativistic magnetic reconnection by itself is a sufficiently rich and important physical process to warrant the effort of developing such a code .",
    "the only numerical study of relativistic magnetic reconnection so far was carried out by watanabe & yokoyama . however , their paper gives no details of their numerical scheme and test simulations and therefore it is not clear as to how accurate their results are and how robust their numerical method is .",
    "since many relevant astrophysical phenomena involve shock waves , including the fast magnetic reconnection of petcheck type @xcite , a useful code should handle well not only current sheets and filaments but also shock waves .",
    "it is well known that codes that do not preserve the magnetic field divergence free can become unstable and crash in the cases with large spacial gradients .",
    "thus this issue must be addressed too . moreover , in the relativistic limit the spacial charge density and the advective current can become significant and thus the electric charge conservation has to be enforced . in this paper",
    "we describe the results of our efforts to construct a code that satisfies these criteria .",
    "the equations of resistive rmhd are described in section  [ equations ] .",
    "the equations of the so - called augmented system of resistive rmhd , that are designed to handle to enforce the divergence free condition for magnetic field and the electric charge conservation are presented in section  [ au - equations ] .",
    "the relativistic ohm law is explained in section  [ ohm law ] .",
    "section  [ num - method ] gives the details of numerical integration .",
    "the test simulations are described in section  [ tests ] and our conclusions are summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the covariant maxwell equations are @xcite    @xmath0    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the maxwell tensor of the electromagnetic field , @xmath3 is the faraday tensor , and @xmath4 is the 4-vector of electric current .    in highly ionized plasma , including pair plasma , the electric and magnetic susceptibilities are essentially zero and one has    @xmath5    @xmath6    where    @xmath7    is the levi - civita alternating tensor of space - time and @xmath8 is the four - dimensional levi - civita symbol .    in the coordinate basis of global inertial frame of special relativity",
    "these equations split into the familiar set    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 are the electric field , the magnetic field , the electric charge density , and the electric current density respectively as measured by the inertial observer ( @xmath16 is the levi - civita tensor of space . ) .",
    "these equations are consistent with the electric charge conservation    @xmath17    in magnetohydrodynamics maxwell s equations are supplemented with the equations of motion of matter and the continuity equation . in the covariant form",
    "the equations of motion can be written as    @xmath18    where the total stress - energy momentum tensor ,    @xmath19    is the sum of the stress - energy momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field    @xmath20    and the stress - energy momentum tensor of matter    @xmath21    here where @xmath22 is the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath23 is the relativistic enthalpy per unit volume as measured in the rest frame of fluid ( @xmath24 includes the rest mass - energy density of matter @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 is the fluid 4-velocity . in the global inertial frame with time - independent coordinate grid eq.[emc ] splits into the energy and momentum conservation laws @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy density , @xmath30 is the energy flux density , @xmath31 is the momentum density , and @xmath32 is the stress tensor . here @xmath33 is the lorentz factor , @xmath34 is the velocity as measured by the inertial observer , and @xmath35 is the metric tensor of space .",
    "the covariant continuity equation is    @xmath36    where @xmath25 is the rest mass density as measured in the rest frame of fluid . in the inertial frame",
    "this reads @xmath37    equations ( [ gaussb],[faraday],[gausse],[ampere],[ecc],[ecl],[mcl],[ce ] ) constitute the 3 + 1 pde system of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in special relativity .",
    "once supplemented with equations of state , that relate various thermodynamic parameters of matter , and with the ohm law , that couples matter and the electromagnetic field , this system closes .",
    "as well known , the divergence free condition ( [ gaussb ] ) for the magnetic field can be treated as a constraint on the initial solution of cauchy problem because the faraday equation ( [ faraday ] ) will then ensure that the magnetic field remains divergence free at any time .",
    "the equation of electric charge conservation is also not independent and follows from the ampere equation ( [ ampere ] ) and the gauss law ( [ gausse ] ) .",
    "these properties of the differential equations are not preserved by many numerical schemes .",
    "indeed , the most straightforward way of constructing a self - consistent finite difference counterpart for a differential system like electrodynamics is to ignore all constraints ( non - evolution equations ) and to leave out all the supplementary laws like the electric charge conservation ( otherwise the system of finite difference equations becomes over - determined ) .",
    "however , it has been discovered that this lack of consistency may lead to strong corruption of numerical solutions in regions with large truncation errors , like strong discontinuities , and even cause code crash . in ideal mhd",
    "the divergence free condition has been found particularly important .",
    "a number of techniques has been proposed to combat the problem .",
    "here we adopt the so - called generalized lagrange multiplier method developed by munz et al .. the main idea is to create a new , augmented system of differential equations , that will include only evolution equations and will have the same solutions of the cauchy problem as the original system provided the initial solution satisfies the differential constraints of the original system .",
    "if , however , the initial solution does not satisfy the constraints then the deviations should decay or at least move away as relatively high speed waves .",
    "this will ensure that the deviations caused by truncation errors of a numerical method for the augmented system remain small .    to deal with the divergence free constraint",
    "we modify eqs.([gaussb],[faraday ] ) so that they become    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a new dynamic variable ( pseudo - potential ) .",
    "from these equations it follows that @xmath40 satisfies the telegraph equation    @xmath41    thus , @xmath40 is transported by hyperbolic waves propagating with the speed of light and decays if @xmath42 . for positive",
    "@xmath43 the natural evolution of @xmath40 is toward @xmath44 ( unless prevented by boundary conditions ) and eq.([agaussb ] ) shows that this final state implies divergence free magnetic field .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the divergence of magnetic field also satisfies the same telegraph equation    @xmath45    and thus evolves in the same fashion .    to deal with the gauss law",
    "we modify eqs.([gausse],[ampere ] ) so they read    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is another new dynamic variable . from these two equations and the electric charge conservation",
    "it follows that the evolution of @xmath48 is again described by the telegraph equation    @xmath49    ( although in principle one could use different constants @xmath43 for @xmath40 and @xmath48 this brings no benefit . )",
    "thus , @xmath48 , naturally evolves in the same fashion as @xmath40 , ensuring that the electrodynamic solution is kept consistent with the gauss law .",
    "similarly , one finds that    @xmath50    summarizing , the augmented system of relativistic mhd is    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 every differential equation of the system is an evolution equation and a conservation law ( with or without a source term ) , and there is wealth of numerical methods for such systems .",
    "for example one could use godunov s upwind scheme @xcite or one of its numerous higher order `` children '' .",
    "this simplicity of numerical implementation is the main advantage of the method of generalized lagrange multiplier .",
    "in this paper we consider only the simplest case of scalar resistivity . in strong magnetic field",
    "the resistivity ( conductivity ) becomes anisotropic and the tensor description becomes more appropriate .",
    "we will consider this case in future .",
    "the covariant form of scalar ohm s law is    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the conductivity , @xmath61 is the resistivity , and @xmath62 is the electric charge density as measured in the fluid frame @xcite . in the general inertial frame",
    "this reads    @xmath63 + q { \\bmath{v } } , \\label{ohml}\\ ] ]    whereas in the fluid frame one has the usual ohm law @xmath64 in the limit of infinite conductivity ( @xmath65 ) eq.([ohml ] ) reduces to @xmath66 splitting this equation into the components that are normal and parallel to the velocity vector one obtains @xmath67 and @xmath68 these show that @xmath69 and thus one has the usual result @xmath70 the purely inductive electric field .",
    "now consider the reduced form of ampere s law @xmath71 which is of interest for numerical schemes using time - splitting technique .",
    "when splitted into components normal and parallel to the velocity vector this equation reads @xmath72=0,\\ ] ] @xmath73=0.\\ ] ] the solutions of initial value problem for these linear equations are @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 and suffix @xmath77 denotes the initial values .",
    "one can see that for relativistic flows the normal component of electric field approaches the inductive value @xmath78 faster than the parallel component approaches zero .",
    "the evolution equations ( [ eeq1]-[eeq2 ] ) can be written as conservation laws . in cartesian coordinates , and this is the only type of coordinates we use in the paper , the system can be written as a single phase vector equation    @xmath79    where    @xmath80 are the vectors of conserved quantities , primitive quantities , and sources respectively and    @xmath81 is the vector of corresponding hyperbolic fluxes . here",
    "@xmath82 are the spatial components of 4-velocity , @xmath83 are the components of the metric tensor of space ( given by kronecker s delta @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 is the levi - civita alternating tensor of space .",
    "we have found useful to split the source term into two parts @xmath86 where @xmath87\\ ] ] is the conductivity current .",
    "the source term @xmath88 is potentially stiff ( in the case of low resistivity ) and is treated via the time - step splitting technique by strang .",
    "that is first the solution is advanced via integration of equation    @xmath89    over the half time - step , @xmath90 .",
    "then the solution is advanced via second - order accurate numerical integration of equation    @xmath91    over the full time - step .",
    "finally , the solution is advanced via integration of equation ( [ step1 ] ) over the half time - step once more .",
    "thanks to the fact that all equations in ( [ step1 ] ) are linear the integration is carried out using analytic solutions , in particular solutions ( [ sol - para],[sol - perp ] ) are utilized at this stage .",
    "this removes stability constraints of the time step otherwise imposed by @xmath88 . in principle",
    "all source terms could be passed to eq.([step1 ] ) but this somehow results in reduction of accuracy .",
    "equation  ( [ step2 ] ) is integrated explicitly    @xmath92 @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the conserved quantity of a cell at @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the conserved quantity of this cell at @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the source term of the cell at @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the flux though the right interface and @xmath101 is the flux though the left interface of the cell normal to the direction of @xmath102 at time @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath103 is the cell size in this direction and @xmath104 is the number of spatial dimensions .    to determine the sources and fluxes at half time - step the solution is temporary advances via @xmath105 @xmath106 the interface fluxes @xmath107",
    "are computed using the hll - prescription @xcite : @xmath108 where indexes @xmath109 and @xmath110 refer to the states respectively to the left and to the right of the interface ( which can be considered as the location of discontinuity in the solution at @xmath95 ) .",
    "note the simplification of the general hll prescription due to the fact that the maximum characteristic speed of the system in each direction equals exactly to the speed of light ( unity in our dimensionless equations ) .",
    "for the auxiliary half time - step these left and right states are found via the piece - wise constant reconstruction of numerical solution in each spatial direction    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the coordinate of the cell center and @xmath113 is the phase state vector of the cell .",
    "the auxiliary solution is then used for another , now quadratic reconstruction of numerical solution within each cell    @xmath114 @xmath115 obviously , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the first and the second order derivatives of the reconstructed solution and these are to be found from the numerical solution using one of many existing non - linear limiters ( needed to avoid spurious oscillations ) . in this particular paper",
    "@xmath116 is found using the same limiter as in our ideal mhd code @xcite    @xmath118    where    @xmath119 are the left and right numerical approximations of the first derivative ( @xmath120 is the cell index along the direction of @xmath102 ) , and    @xmath121    to find @xmath117 we use a similar procedure .",
    "first we compute the left , center , and right numerical approximations for the second derivative , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , and then we feed them to the minmod function with three arguments    @xmath125    where @xmath126 the left and right states of each cell interface that are found via this second reconstruction are then used to compute hll - fluxes @xmath100 of equation ( [ step2-int ] ) .",
    "the resulting scheme is second order accuracy in time and third order accuracy in space .",
    "in these test simulations we use the polytropic equation of state @xmath127 with the ratio of specific heats @xmath128 .",

    "this suggest that shock may be resolved .",
    "however , the rather small increase in the shock width between the cases with @xmath152 and @xmath143 shows that numerical dissipation is still important for @xmath143 and only for higher resistivity the shock structure becomes fully resolved ( see fig.[var ] ) .      to set up this test we utilized the analytical solution for ideal mhd alfvn waves obtained in komissarov . in this test @xmath131 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and the alfvn speed @xmath155 .",

    "the initial electric field is computed via eq.([e - ideal ] ) and the electric charge density via eq.([gausse ] ) .",
    "the computational grid is uniform and has 400 cells in @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "the resistivity is set to a relatively small value , @xmath164 , in order to get closer to the ideal case .",
    "the simulations are continued up to @xmath165 and then compared with the exact solution of ideal mhd at the same time ( fig.[aw ] ) .",
    "one can see that the agreement is pretty good .",
    "the ideal solution keeps the wave profile totally invariant , however the numerical solution is a little distorted , mainly due to numerical dissipation ( this is confirmed by studying the dependence on @xmath61 ) .",
    "when the zero gradient boundary conditions ( free - flow ) are utilised in the simulations then both the fast and the slow waves do not get reflected of boundaries and cleanly pass through .",
    "however , the alfvn waves exhibit noticeable reflection ( in contract to the results with our ideal mhd code ) . we have not figured out yet as to how to avoid such a reflection .",
    "assume that @xmath166 , the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure everywhere , and @xmath167 changes sign within a thin current layer of width @xmath168 .",
    "provided the initial solution is in equilibrium , @xmath169const , the evolution is a slow diffusive expansion of the layer caused by the resistivity and described by the archetypal diffusion equation    @xmath170 as the width of the layer becomes much larger than @xmath168 the expansion becomes self - similar @xmath171 where erf is the error function , and this analytic results can be used to test the resitive part of the code . in the test problem that is presented here the initial solution",
    "has uniform distribution of @xmath172 , @xmath131 , @xmath173 , and @xmath160 and the initial magnetic field is given by eq.([erf ] ) for @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath143 .",

    "the numerical simulations are continued up to @xmath177 and then the numerical solution is compared with the solution ( [ erf ] ) for @xmath178 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ errf ]  one can not see the difference between the solutions .",
    "all the one - dimensional problems , that are described above , have been used to test both the 2d and 3d versions of the code via application in all two / three directions of the cartesian grid .",
    "the results are almost identical to that of 1d tests .",
    "in addition we considered several generically multi - dimensional problems .",
    "strong symmetric explosions are useful standard tests for mhd codes even if there are no exact analytic solutions to work with .",
    "this is because the generated shocks make all possible angles to the grid and to the magnetic field thus allowing to detect well hidden bugs and to reveal potential weaknesses . in this problem",
    "the cartesian computational domain is @xmath179 with 200 equidistant grid points in each direction .",

    "finally , we tested our 3d code on the problem of spherical explosion .",
    "all parameters of the explosion are the same as in the cylindrical case with exception of the explosion zone - now this is a sphere of unit radius .",

    "figures [ bw3d ] and [ bw3d - cut ] show the numerical solution for @xmath192 and @xmath193 at @xmath151 .",
    "the general structure of the solution is similar to that of the cylindrical case but with much stronger central rarefaction .",
    "one qualitatively new feature is the non - vanishing electric charge density ( top right panel of fig.[bw3d ] ) .",
    "given the axial symmetry of the problem one expects the solutions to be the same in the planes @xmath194 and @xmath190 .",
    "figure  [ bw3d - cut ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "we have constructed a multidimensional upwind scheme for resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics . at the moment",
    "only the case of scalar resistivity has been implemented and more work has to be done to incorporate the case of tensor resistivity .",
    "the results of test simulations show that the scheme is robust in the regime of small to moderate magnetization , which can be described by the ratio of the electromagnetic energy density to the total mass - energy density of matter .",
    "the regime of high magnetization is still problematic as the the truncation errors for the energy - momentum of matter become large often making impossible to convert the conserved quantities into the primitive ones .",
    "this is a well know problem of all conservative schemes for relativistic mhd .",
    "apart from this drawback the scheme can handle equally well both resistive current sheets and shock waves and thus can be a useful tool for studying phenomena of relativistic astrophysics that involve both colliding supersonic flows and magnetic reconnection .",

    "<S> the paper describes a new upwind conservative numerical scheme for special relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics with scalar resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is kept approximately divergence free and the divergence of the electric field consistent with the electric charge distribution via the method of generalized lagrange multiplier . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperbolic fluxes are computed using the hll prescription and the source terms are accounted via the time - splitting technique . </S>",
    "<S> the results of test simulations show that the scheme can handle equally well both resistive current sheets and shock waves and thus can be a useful tool for studying phenomena of relativistic astrophysics that involve both colliding supersonic flows and magnetic reconnection .    </S>",
