    "in a wireless multiple - access network operated with the slotted aloha access protocol , a number of users transmit messages to a sink node through a common wireless medium .",
    "time is divided into discrete slots and all transmissions start at the beginning of a timeslot .",
    "collisions / interferences occur when more than one user transmits in the same timeslot @xcite . successive interference cancellation ( sic ) was proposed for slotted aloha to resolve collisions so that signals contained in collisions can be leveraged to increase throughput @xcite . in this approach",
    ", a number of timeslots are grouped together as a frame .",
    "each user aims to deliver at most one packet per frame , but it can transmit copies of the same packet in different timeslots of the frame .    to see the essence ,",
    "suppose we have two users and the first user transmits two copies of packet @xmath0 in timeslots @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , and the second user transmits one copy of packet @xmath3 in timeslots @xmath2 .",
    "since no collision occurs , @xmath0 can be correctly decoded by the sink node in timeslot @xmath1 .",
    "a collision occurs in timeslot 2 . in sic ,",
    "the sink node can use @xmath0 decoded from timeslot 1 to cancel the interference in timeslot 2 .",
    "this approach can be applied iteratively to cancel more interference , in a manner similar to the belief propagation ( bp ) decoding of lt codes over erasure channels .",
    "slotted aloha with sic has been extensively studied based on the and - or - tree analysis , and optimal designs have been obtained @xcite .",
    "_ physical - layer network coding ( pnc ) _ @xcite ( also known as _ compute - and - forward _",
    "@xcite ) is recently applied to wireless multiple - access network to improve the throughput @xcite .",
    "such multiple - access schemes , called _ network - coded multiple access ( ncma ) _ , employ both pnc and multiuser decoders at the physical layer to decode one or multiple linear combinations of the packets simultaneously transmitted in a timeslot .",
    "specifically , lu , you and liew @xcite demonstrated by a prototype that a pnc decoder may sometimes successfully recover linear combinations of the packets when the traditional multiuser decoder ( mud ) @xcite that does not make use of pnc fails . in the existing works on pnc ( or compute - and - forward ) , the decoding of the xor of the packets of two users has been extensively investigated @xcite ( see also the overview @xcite ) .",
    "the decoding of multiple linear combinations over a larger alphabet has been studied in @xcite . in this paper , we consider slotted aloha employing pnc ( and mud ) at the physical layer , called _ network - coded slotted aloha ( ncsa)_. we assume that the physical - layer decoder at the sink node can reliably recover one or multiple linear combinations of the packets transmitted simultaneously in one timeslot . our work in this paper",
    "does not depend on a specific pnc scheme .",
    "specifically , we consider a @xmath4-user ncsa system , where each user has one input packet to be delivered over a frame of timeslots .",
    "a packet is the smallest transmission unit , which can not be further separated into multiple smaller transmission units .",
    "but it is allowed to send multiple copies of a packet in different timeslots .",
    "the number of copies , called the _ degree _ , is independently sampled from a _",
    "degree distribution_. the linear equations decoded by the physical layer in a timeslot form a system of linear equations .",
    "different systems of linear equations are recovered in different timeslots . to recover the input packets of users , a message decoder",
    "is then required to jointly solve these systems of linear equations obtained over different timeslots .",
    "though gaussian elimination can be applied to solve the input packets , the computational complexity is @xmath5 finite - field operations , where @xmath6 the number of field symbols in a packet . in this paper",
    ", we study the design of ncsa employing an efficient message decoding algorithm .    with the possibility of decoding more than one linear combination of packets in a timeslot ,",
    "the coding problem induced by ncsa becomes different from that of slotted aloha with sic .",
    "we will show by an example that the ordinary bp decoding algorithm of lt codes over erasure channels is not optimal for ncsa .",
    "we instead propose a _ batched bp decoding algorithm _ for ncsa , where gaussian elimination is applied locally to solve the linear system associated with each timeslot , and bp is applied between the linear systems obtained over different timeslots .",
    "the computational complexity of our algorithm is @xmath7 finite - field operations , which is of the same order as the ordinary bp decoding algorithm .",
    "we analyze the asymptotic performance of the batched bp decoding algorithm when @xmath4 is large by generalizing the tree - based approach in @xcite .",
    "we provide an approach to optimize the degree distribution based on our analytical results .",
    "though the batched bp decoding is similar to the one proposed for ncma @xcite , we can not apply the analysis therein . in ncma",
    ", we assume that the number of users is fixed but the number of packets to be delivered by each user tends to infinity . in ncsa",
    ", each user has only one packet while the number of users can be large .",
    "similar schemes have been developed for random linear network coding over finite fields without explicitly considering the physical - layer effect , e.g. , bats codes and chunked codes ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . here",
    "the technique for ncsa is different from bats ( or chunked ) codes in two aspects .",
    "first , in bats codes the degree distribution of batches is the parameter to be optimized , while in ncsa the degree distribution of the input packets ( variable nodes ) is the parameter to be optimized .",
    "second , the decoding of bats codes only solves the associated linear system of a batch when it is uniquely solvable ( and hence recovers all the input packets involved in a batch ) , while the decoding of ncsa processes the associated linear system of a batch even when it is not uniquely solvable .    in the remainder of this paper ,",
    "section  [ sec : netw - coded - slott ] formally introduces ncsa and presents our main analytical result ( theorem  [ the:1 ] ) .",
    "an outline of the proof of the theorem is given in section  [ sec : performance - analysis ] .",
    "an example is provided in section  [ sec : example ] to demonstrate the degree distribution optimization and the numerical results .",

    "we call the set of packets @xmath36 decoded in a timeslot a _ batch_. the cardinality of @xmath23 ( the number of users transmitting in a timeslot ) is called the _ degree of the batch / timeslot_. we call the ratio @xmath37 the _ design rate _ of ncsa .",

    "the original input packets can be recovered by solving the linear equations of all the timeslots jointly .",
    "gaussian elimination has a complexity @xmath5 finite - field operations when @xmath52 , which makes the decoding less efficient when @xmath4 is large .",
    "the output packets of all the timeslots collectively can be regarded as a low - density generator matrix ( ldgm ) code .",
    "similar to decoding an lt code , which is also a ldgm code , we can apply the ( ordinary ) bp algorithm to decode the output packets . in each step of the bp decoding algorithm ,",
    "an output packet of degree one is found , the corresponding input packet is decoded , and the decoded input packet is substituted into the other output packets in which it is involved .",
    "the decoding stops when there are no more output packets of degree one .",
    "however , as we will show in the next example , the ordinary bp decoding can not decode some types of batches efficiently .",
    "we can actually do better than the ordinary bp decoding with little increase of decoding complexity by exploiting the batch structure of the output packets .    for example , consider a batch of two packets @xmath53 and @xmath54 formed by @xmath55 suppose that we use the ordinary bp decoding algorithm , and when the bp decoding stops , @xmath0 is recovered by processing other batches , but @xmath3 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are not recovered .",

    "<S> slotted aloha can benefit from physical - layer network coding ( pnc ) by decoding one or multiple linear combinations of the packets simultaneously transmitted in a timeslot , forming a system of linear equations . </S>",
    "<S> different systems of linear equations are recovered in different timeslots . </S>",
    "<S> a message decoder then recovers the original packets of all the users by jointly solving multiple systems of linear equations obtained over different timeslots . </S>",
    "<S> we propose the batched bp decoding algorithm that combines belief propagation ( bp ) and local gaussian elimination . compared with pure gaussian elimination decoding </S>",
    "<S> , our algorithm reduces the decoding complexity from cubic to linear function of the number of users . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the ordinary bp decoding algorithm for low - density generator - matrix codes , our algorithm has better performance and the same order of computational complexity . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the performance of the batched bp decoding algorithm by generalizing the tree - based approach and provide an approach to optimize the system performance . </S>"
