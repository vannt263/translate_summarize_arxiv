    "scattering problems in quantum mechanics and maxwell s theory exhibit a great deal of similarities .",
    "the dielectric constant of an electromagnetic scattering structure is analogous to a scattering potential in the schrdinger equation .",
    "if the potential is real and bounded from above , then solutions of the wave equation ( schrdinger s or maxwell s ) appear in two kinds @xcite .",
    "there are radiation modes that carry the energy flux to the spatial infinity and modes trapped in some ( bounded ) spatial region .",
    "the former are known as scattering states .",
    "they do not have a finite @xmath0 norm , and their spectrum is continuous ( the radiation continuum ) .",
    "in contrast , solutions of the second kind have a finite @xmath0 norm and a discrete spectrum which typically lies below the radiation continuum . in quantum mechanics , these are bound states . in maxwell",
    "s theory , they are electromagnetic waves localized , e.g. , in metal cavities or in defects of photonic crystals .",
    "it was first proved by von neumann and wigner @xcite in 1929 that , in quantum mechanics , there may exist bound states in the radiation continuum ( i.e. , there are localized solutions of the schrdinger equation whose energies lie in the continuum part of the system spectrum ) .",
    "an apparent physical peculiarity of such states is that , despite the boundedness of the potential barrier , they do not decay into the scattering modes through the tunneling , which is rather counterintuitive and unusual .",
    "an example constructed by von neumann and wigner was somewhat artificial from the physical point of view , and no significant applications of this phenomenon immediately followed their discovery . however , much later unusually long - lived resonances were observed in atomic physics @xcite and the question about a physical mechanism of their stability arose .",
    "+ from the mathematical point of view , scattering resonances can be associated with solutions of the wave equation that satisfy the outgoing wave boundary condition at the spatial infinity , i.e. , in the asymptotic region , the solutions look like waves outgoing from the scattering structure @xcite .",
    "clearly , such solutions can not preserve energy ( or probability ) flux and , hence , do not exist for real frequencies ( or energies ) .",
    "so they have complex eigen - frequencies and decay exponentially with time . due to linearity of the wave equation ,",
    "a solution of a scattering problem is a linear superposition of the incident wave and scattered waves that satisfy the outgoing wave boundary condition .",
    "the resonant solutions may therefore be used to construct the scattered wave , and the flux conservation is achieved by balancing the incoming flux of the incident wave and the outgoing flux carried by scattered waves .",
    "it was proved then that the resonant scattering amplitude may be approximated by the celebrated breit - wigner formula @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the incident wave frequency , and @xmath3 is the eigen - frequency of the resonant mode .",
    "if the imaginary part @xmath4 is small ( @xmath5 ) , then the scattering cross - section @xmath6 exhibits a sharp maximum ( of width @xmath4 ) at frequencies near @xmath7 .",
    "thus , resonances with small @xmath4 can be associated with quasi - bound states , excitations with a finite lifetime @xmath8 , that decay by emitting a nearly monochromatic radiation of frequency @xmath7 . in this picture , the bound states in the radiation continuum may be understood as scattering resonances with the vanishing width .",
    "if a system allows for two close resonances whose positions and widths depend continuously on a physical parameter of the system that can be varied , then there might exist critical values of this parameter at which one of the resonances turns into a bound states @xcite .",
    "this is the subject of the theory of coupled resonances developed in quantum scattering theory @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which the width of one of the coupled resonances vanishes were established .",
    "the theory of coupled resonances provided an explanation of the existence of the aforementioned unusually long - lived resonances observed in atomic systems .",
    "+ resonant scattering properties of gratings and periodically structured thin films were observed long time ago in optics @xcite .",
    "typically , a grating would exhibit sharp resonances near its diffraction thresholds @xcite .",
    "however an explanation based on quasi - bound states came much later .",
    "naturally , the breit - wigner theory can be extended to the electromagnetic scattering , and coupled resonances might be expected to exist in photonic structures @xcite .",
    "a simple example is provided by two parallel identical gratings .",
    "each grating supports a quasi - stationary electromagnetic mode localized in its vicinity ( a trapped mode ) , which can be excited by an incident radiation . in the zero order diffraction , this mode has only one decay channel . therefore one might anticipate a formation of a wave guiding mode confined between the structures at a certain distance between the gratings . if the trapped mode associated with each grating decays by emitting a monochromatic radiation outgoing both ways along the normal to the structure , then there might exist a distance at which the waves outgoing from each structure interfere destructively in the asymptotic region , thus producing a localized stable solution ( the energy flux outgoing from the structure vanishes ) .",
    "this argument can be made rigorous by considering the fabri - perot interferometer whose interfaces have reflection and transmission coefficients described by the breit - wigner theory @xcite .",
    "when the distance gets smaller , the interference effects of the near field of the trapped modes becomes significant , and the fabri - perot argument becomes inapplicable as it applies only to the modes carrying the energy flux , i.e. , radiation modes .",
    "maxwell s equations must then be studied .",
    "bound states in the radiation continuum were indeed found by numerical studies of the system of two gratings in the spectral region where only one diffraction channel is open .",
    "they are formed at a discrete set of distances that follows the pattern predicted by the aforementioned fabri - perot argument for large distances and substantially deviates from it when the distance is of order the grating period @xcite .",
    "also , localized waveguide solutions were argued to exist in the same spectral region by studying maxwell s equations for layers whose dielectric function is periodic in one direction along the layer and translational invariant along the other one @xcite .",
    "+ here bound states in the radiation continuum are studied analytically for a system of two arrays of parallel dielectric cylinders .",
    "the approach is based on the resonant scattering theory @xcite where the bound states are identified as resonances with the vanishing width ( the distance between the arrays is a physical parameter which regulates the coupling of the resonances ) .",
    "the study is carried out for the whole radiation spectrum range .",
    "in addition to the bound states in the zero - order diffraction ( which were known to exist from the early numerical studies ) , bounds states are found in the spectral range where two diffraction channels are open .",
    "analytic solutions of maxwell s equations for all the bound states are given in the limit when the cylinder radius is much smaller than the period of the structure .",
    "the system is shown to have bound states below the radiation continuum whose explicit form is also found .",
    "+ the interest to subwavelength periodic structures has been revitalized due to a recent technological progress in manufacturing such structures for the optical frequency range @xcite . an ultimate goal is to develop a technology for the so - called all optical data processing @xcite . one way or the other , this task amounts to finding physical mechanisms to control optical non - linear effects in photonic structures as , e.g. , a typical logical element in data processing requires a device similar to a transistor . as a potential application , here the near field of resonant excitations",
    "is studied as a function of the distance between the arrays that varies in the vicinity of its critical values at which the bound states are formed ( the width of one of the resonances vanishes ) .",
    "it is shown that the near field can be significantly amplified ( as compared with the incident radiation field ) in some particular regions of the structure as the distance approaches its critical values .",
    "the effect can therefore be used to enhance optical non - linear effects in a controllable way . + the paper is organized as follows : a classification of solutions of maxwell s equations that is convenient for identifying the bound states in the radiation continuum in the system studied is described in section  [ sec:1 ] .",
    "explicit solutions for the bound states below the radiation continuum as well as in the radiation continuum when one diffraction channel is open are given in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the effect of the near field amplification for a resonant scattering when the distance between the arrays is close to one of its critical values at which the bound states are formed is investigated in section  [ sec:7 ] .",
    "lastly , the existence of bound states when more than one diffraction channel are open is established in section  [ sec:5 ] . whenever possible , the technical details are moved to the appendix .",
    "the system considered is sketched in fig .  [ fig:1](a ) .",
    "it consists of an infinite double array of parallel , periodically positioned , dielectric cylinders suspended in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "the cylinders are assumed to be non - dispersive with a dielectric constant @xmath9 .",
    "the coordinate system is set so that the cylinders are parallel to the @xmath10axis , the structure is periodic along the @xmath11axis , and the @xmath12axis is normal to the structure .",
    "the unit of length is taken to be the array period and the arrays have a relative mismatch @xmath13 $ ] along the x - axis .     from the x - axis .",
    "panel ( b ) : the energy spectrum for a schrdinger equation with radially symmetric potential consists of a discrete spectrum of bound states with negative energies and the radiation continuum .",
    "the latter may contain additional bound states ; these are the bound states in the radiation continuum.panels ( c ) and ( d ) : harmonically time dependent solutions to eq.([eq:1 ] ) are labeled by points of the spectral cylinder as explained in text .",
    "the diffraction thresholds @xmath14 are rings that partition the cylinder into sections corresponding to a fixed number of open channels .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 is the threshold for the radiation continuum below which there can be no scattering states . ]",
    "+ the structure is illuminated by a linearly polarized monochromatic beam with the electric field parallel to the cylinders ( tm polarization ) . in the given settings , maxwell s equations",
    "are reduced to the scalar wave equation for a single component of the electric field , denoted @xmath16 , in the @xmath17plane : @xmath18 where the dielectric function @xmath19 is piecewise constant ; it is equal to @xmath9 on the scatterers and to @xmath20 otherwise . for a harmonic time",

    "consequently , the wave vectors of the scattered radiation can only have the following form @xmath30 with the convention @xmath31 if @xmath32 .",

    "similarly , in the region to the left of the structure , the electric field is given by @xmath37    where @xmath38 are the amplitudes of the reflected modes .",
    "the choice between @xmath39 and @xmath40 is dictated by the outgoing wave boundary condition at the spatial infinity @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , the field corresponding to closed channels in eqs.([eq:5 ] ) decays exponentially in the asymptotic region @xmath42 .",
    "so the closed channels do not contribute to the energy flux carried by the scattered wave .",
    "the scattered flux is carried only by the radiation in open diffraction channels . the condition @xmath43 defines the _ threshold _ for opening the @xmath44 diffraction channel .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath36 for open channels are the reflection and transmission coefficients , respectively .",
    "+ the transmission and reflection amplitudes may be inferred from the solution @xmath45 of the lippmann - schwinger integral equation @xcite @xmath46 in which @xmath47 is the 2-dimensional free - space green s function for the helmholtz operator @xmath48 with outgoing boundary conditions , and @xmath49 is the hankel function of the first kind of order @xmath50 .",
    "it should be stressed that this equation is to be understood in the distributional sense .",
    "this is because the potential under consideration is neither compactly supported nor does it vanish at infinity so that the usual methods that establish this equation can not be used @xcite .",
    "see appendix  [ asec:1 ] for details .",
    "+ on a different note , observe that , unless there is no incident radiation ( the term @xmath51 is omitted ) , the solutions to eq.([eq:2 ] ) can not be square integrable along the z - axis . by the analogy with quantum scattering theory for",
    "radially symmetric potentials , such solutions are in the radiation continuum of the energy spectrum . in quantum theory ,",
    "solutions to the schrdinger equation are eigenvectors of the energy operator whose spectrum @xmath52 form a subset in the real line .",
    "the upper part ( positive ) of the spectrum is continuous and corresponds to scattered states that can carry the probability flux to the spatial infinity . below the continuous part of the spectrum , i.e. , @xmath53 , the energy spectrum is discrete ( see fig .",

    "it was first proved by von neumann and wigner in 1929 that under special circumstances , there might exist bound states in the radiation continuum .",
    "a counterintuitive physical peculiarity of such states is that a bound state is a standing wave in a potential well ( an attractive potential ) , while the conventional quantum mechanical wisdom would suggest that for a potential bounded above a standing wave with the energy in the radiation continuum should tunnel through the potential barrier to the spatial infinity and , hence , can not be stable .",
    "nevertheless , such states do exist and the theory of their formation is now well developed @xcite .",
    "the goal here is to establish a similar picture for electromagnetic excitations in the periodic double array of dielectric cylinders , and , specifically , to find the conditions on the physical parameters of this system under which the bound states in the radiation continuum exist , their eigen - frequencies , and the analytic form of the corresponding electromagnetic fields .",
    "the very existence of bound states for this system was first demonstrated by numerical simulations @xcite . here",
    "a complete analytic study of the system is given .",

    "it will be called a _ spectral cylinder _ ( or spectral space ) of a periodic grating .",
    "in contrast to quantum mechanical bound states in spherically symmetric systems , the bloch boundary condition requires a more adequate classification of bound states here . in order to identify bound states in the radiation continuum",

    "<S> electromagnetic bound states in the radiation continuum are studied for periodic double arrays of subwavelength dielectric cylinders in tm polarization . </S>",
    "<S> they are similar to localized waveguide mode solutions of maxwell s equations for metal cavities or defects of photonic crystals , but , in contrast to the latter , their spectrum lies in the radiation continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is identical to the existence of bound sates in the radiation continuum in quantum mechanics , discovered by von neumann and wigner . in the formal scattering theory , </S>",
    "<S> these states appear as resonances with the vanishing width . for </S>",
    "<S> the system studied , the bound states are shown to exist at specific distances between the arrays in the spectral region where one or two diffraction channels are open . </S>",
    "<S> analytic solutions are obtained for all bound states ( below the radiation continuum and in it ) in the limit of thin cylinders ( the cylinder radius is much smaller than the wavelength ) . the existence of bound states is also established in the spectral region where three and more diffraction channels are open , provided the dielectric constant and radius of the cylinders are fine - tuned . </S>",
    "<S> the near field and scattering resonances of the structure are investigated when the distance between the arrays varies in a neighborhood of its critical values at which the bound states are formed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that the near field in the scattering process becomes significantly amplified in specific regions of the array as the distance approaches its critical values . </S>",
    "<S> the effect may be used to control optical non - linear effects by varying the distance between the arrays near its critical values . </S>"
