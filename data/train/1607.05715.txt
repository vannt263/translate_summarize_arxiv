    "the simplest class of fourth order metric gravity theories is based on an action @xmath3 where @xmath4 ; the speed of light , @xmath5 , is set to one ; @xmath6 is the determinant of a lorentzian 4-dimensional metric @xmath7 , and @xmath8 the associated curvature scalar , while @xmath9 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "general relativity with a cosmological constant @xmath10 is obtained by setting @xmath11 .",
    "the vacuum part of these models , i.e. , @xmath12 , has recently achieved some popularity where certain forms of the function @xmath0 have resulted in geometric models of inflation or , more recently , dark energy , see e.g.  @xcite@xcite and also  @xcite for a historical background . although an assessment of cosmological viability requires a study of spatially homogeneous and isotropic robertson - walker ( rw ) models and perturbations thereof , we will restrict the analysis in this paper to flat rw cosmology .",
    "the vacuum equations of these models can be written as ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    [ jordanfulleq ] @xmath13 ,   \\label{ddotrf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14    in the above equations an overdot represents the jordan proper time @xmath15 derivative , @xmath16 is the scale factor of the flat rw metric in the jordan frame , @xmath17 is the jordan hubble variable , @xmath8 is the jordan curvature scalar , and @xmath18 by regarding @xmath19 as an independent variable , equation   forms a constraint that the evolution equations must satisfy .",
    "furthermore , equation   for @xmath16 decouples , which leads to a reduced closed system of first order equations for @xmath20 , which , due to the constraint  , yield a dynamical system describing a flow on a 2-dimensional state space .",
    "once the reduced system of first order equations has been solved , the decoupled equation   yields @xmath21 ) .",
    "the above system of equations has some general properties which are worth mentioning .",
    "firstly , the system is invariant under the transformation @xmath22 , a property we will use below . secondly , the system is ill - defined whenever @xmath23 for some value(s ) of @xmath8 .",
    "is identically zero , a case we will not consider here . ] this is related to pathological properties as regards the characteristics of @xmath0 gravity , where , e.g. , the properties of gravitational waves will severely constrain the physical viability of such models .",
    "it is therefore natural to divide @xmath0 gravity into two main classes of models : those for which @xmath24 and those for which this is not the case .",
    "thirdly , as it is well known @xmath25 is associated with that one can introduce an einstein frame .",
    "however , @xmath26 is not , in general , an invariant subset in the jordan frame , since @xmath27 where we have used   ( i.e. , @xmath26 is only an invariant subset if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are simultaneously zero for some value of @xmath8 ) .",
    "this suggest that it is also natural to divide @xmath0 models into two additional classes , those with @xmath25 everywhere , and those for which @xmath29 can change sign .",
    "the latter case yields solutions in the einstein frame that can be conformally extended in the jordan frame , but which ones depend on the explicit form of @xmath0 .",
    "we will later explicitly illustrate this result in the context of a specific model , which also exemplifies some other general features of @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "there are a number of dynamical systems formulations in the literature that are based on transformations from @xmath20 to some other variables ( see appendix  [ app : systems ] for a discussion on several of these formulations ) . in this context",
    "there has been considerable activity concerning fixed points ( also called singular points , equilibrium points , critical points ) and their linear stability properties .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider the fixed points of the basic reduced state space variables @xmath20 , which must satisfy @xmath30 as follows from   and  .",
    "then ,   takes the form ( assuming that @xmath31 is non - zero ) @xmath32 which is thereby automatically satisfied .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 is identically zero , if and only if @xmath34 , and only in this case there is a line of fixed points for which @xmath35 , while all other models have isolated fixed points .",
    "when transforming to other variables care has to be taken when it comes to the physical interpretation of fixed point results .",
    "as we will see , some fixed points in other formulations simply reflect a break down of those variables , i.e. , they correspond to a state space coordinate singularity .",
    "it is also essential to note that fixed points do not always give a complete asymptotic description .",
    "as will be emphasized in this paper , it is necessary to consider the dynamics on the entire state space of a given model to make an assessment of its physical content .",
    "what is then required in order to obtain a complete description of the solution space and the properties of those solutions for a given @xmath0 rw model ?",
    "we will illustrate some of the ingredients that are required to answer this question with a specific example , but for all @xmath0 rw cosmologies one needs to do the following :    * state space analysis . * a complete state space adapted coordinate",
    "cover , including those state space boundaries for which the equations can be extended ( this e.g. excludes boundaries for which @xmath31 becomes zero ) . * local and global dynamical systems analysis . * physical solution space interpretation .",
    "let us now comment on the above in a little more detail .",
    "( i ) a state space analysis entails dimensional and scale considerations , and a study of the algebraic structure of the constraint equation  , which includes global aspects such as state space topology .",
    "( ii ) this means that one needs to find state space coordinates that _ globally _ cover the state space of a given model , including the boundaries for which the equations can be differentiable extended .",
    "this may include limits where @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath8 become unbounded , which motivates the introduction of new _ bounded _ variables .",
    "note that some models will even in principle require several coordinate patches , but there are classes of models for which one can find common _ local _ useful variables . even in cases where it is possible to find a bounded global state space coordinate system",
    ", it might still be useful to consider other variables since it is unlikely that a global system , except under very special circumstances , is the optimal one for all local structures , i.e. , there might exist complementary sets of variables .",
    "furthermore , different models have different state space structures , and in general this requires different choices of variables  the common element is instead a state space analysis and an adaption to the structures that the analysis reveals .",
    "( iii ) to understand the solution space structure of a given model and the asymptotical behaviour of the solutions , which is essential for assessing its physical viability ( it is not enough to consider special solutions , e.g. , fixed points ) , one must , in general , apply linear _ and _ non - linear fixed point techniques , as well as _",
    "global _ dynamical systems analysis .",
    "furthermore , note that fixed points will not in general give a complete asymptotic description , e.g. , a problem might naturally give rise to limit cycles .",
    "that a global understanding of the solution space is required is illustrated by the fact that if one has found a solution with a desirable evolution , then the models will still only be of interest if this solution is in some sense an ` attractor solution . '",
    "even so , this does not exclude that there exists an additional set of solutions that have a different evolution , which leads to issues concerning measures describing how ` typical ' a solution is .",
    "( iv ) solutions , e.g. fixed points , have to be physically interpreted since a solution might be an artifact of the variables one has used .",
    "for example , variables that do not cover the entire jordan state space result in coordinate singularities , which results in fixed points .",
    "thus fixed points may not correspond to physical phenomena , but may instead show that a formulation breaks down .    to illustrate the above issues ( excluding the situation where @xmath31 passes through zero , which we will comment on in the final discussion ) , as well as allowing us to introduce some dynamical systems methods of quite wide applicability",
    ", we will consider a specific example , the vacuum equations for the flat rw metric with @xmath36 this model has attracted considerable attention in the past , see e.g. ,  @xcite@xcite , and it still remains as one of the more successful models of inflation  @xcite .",
    "although some interesting results have been obtained , previous analyses have been severely hampered by formulations that do not give a complete , or sometimes correct , description of the global solution space and its properties .",
    "in contrast , we will here give a complete description of the entire solution space of these models , and we will also describe the solutions asymptotic behaviour .",
    "more importantly though is that this model allows us to explicitly address some aspects about how to obtain useful dynamical systems treatments of rw @xmath0 models , and to illustrate various dynamical systems methods .",
    "for example , we will situate the entire solution space of the einstein frame in the state space of the jordan frame , which allows us to explicitly show how some solutions in the einstein frame for these models correspond to entire solutions in the jordan frame , while other solutions can be conformally extended in the jordan frame . in other words ,",
    "a local dictionary between the two frames does not always entail global equivalence ( the curious reader can skip ahead and take a look at figures  [ fig : vacuumjf ] , [ fig : einsteinstatespace ] and  [ fig : jordan_einsteinbound ] below ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we make a state space analysis for the @xmath1 models , which is used to produce a new regular unconstrained dynamical system formulation on a compact state space for the jordan frame .",
    "we then use this system to perform a local analysis of the fixed points , focusing on non - linear aspects such as blow ups of nilpotent fixed points .",
    "this is followed by a global analysis that gives a complete description of the entire solution space of the models , which is depicted and summarized in figure  [ fig : vacuumjf ] .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the global topological structure of the state space for a full understanding of the solution space . in section  [ sec : ein ] we present a new regular unconstrained dynamical system formulation on a compact state space for the einstein frame .",
    "we then perform a local analysis of fixed points , again focusing on non - linear aspects such as center manifold analysis .",
    "it is also shown that the breakdown of the einstein frame variables at @xmath26 leads to fixed points in the einstein frame state space that correspond to coordinate singularities in the jordan frame , thereby emphasizing the importance of physical interpretation of fixed points .",
    "this is followed by global considerations , which yield a complete description of the solution space in the einstein frame .",
    "the section ends with situating the global einstein frame state space in the global jordan frame state space by means of the variable transformations that link the two approaches , given in appendix  [ app : relations ] .",
    "this allows us to identify ( a ) the solutions in the einstein frame that can be conformally extended in the jordan frame , and ( b ) the solutions in the einstein frame whose evolution completely describes that in the jordan frame . in section  [ sec : disc ] we comment on the relationship between our global jordan state space approach and other jordan state space formulations , which are briefly reviewed in appendix  [ app : systems ] , where their advantages and disadvantages are discussed .",
    "we also give a fairly general discussion of @xmath0 cosmology , which situates the present models in this more general context .",
    "in this section we first perform a state space analysis of the @xmath1 , @xmath37 vacuum models with flat rw geometry in the jordan frame . the result",
    "is then used to derive a new regular dynamical systems formulation on a global compactified state space , which , in contrast to other formulations , completely covers the entire physical state space of these models , and its asymptotic boundaries .",
    "we then use this state space picture to perform a local fixed points analysis , which includes using blow up techniques and center manifold analysis , followed by global considerations .",
    "this yields a complete description of the entire solution space , depicted in figure  [ fig : vacuumjf ] .      specializing @xmath0 to @xmath1 , @xmath37 ,",
    "the evolution equations   and   can be written as :    [ jordanorigeq ] @xmath38 while the constraint   takes the form @xmath39    for future reference , note that restricting the general discussion leading to eq .  , which shows that the einstein frame boundary @xmath26 is not in general an invariant subset , to the present case , @xmath40 yields that @xmath41 as also follows from  . as a consequence there are solutions with @xmath25 that come from the region with @xmath42 ( vice - versa if @xmath43 ) and pass through the @xmath26 surface in the jordan state space , i.e. , some solutions in the einstein frame can be conformally extended in the jordan frame ( we will show this explicitly below ) .    our first step in the state space analysis is to consider dimensions .",
    "the dimensions of @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath8 , @xmath19 , and @xmath44 are given by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively , where @xmath45 stands for length ( recall that the speed of light has been set to one ) .",
    "in contrast to general relativity , the present models , which reflect a general feature of @xmath0 gravity , break scale invariance . as a consequence it will not be possible to use scale invariance to decouple an equation , as is often done in dynamical systems treatments of general relativistic problems .",
    "however , we can choose dimensionless variables that eliminate the explicit appearance of @xmath44 ( in general there can of course exist several dimensional parameters for which one can form dimensionless ratios leaving a single dimensional parameter , where only the explicit appearance of the latter can be eliminated by an appropriate choice of variables ) .",
    "our next step in our state space analysis is to study and simplify the constraint   as much as possible . for the present case it is possible to globally bring the constraint to a quadratic canonical form where all variables have the same dimension .",
    "first note that if one chooses @xmath50 as a new variable , then this variable as well as @xmath17 are seen to be ` state space null variables . ' by appropriate scaling them with @xmath44 so that they obtain the same dimension @xmath47 as @xmath8 , and then making a linear transformation so that the constraint   takes a canonical quadratic form , results in    @xmath51    with    [ tsxseq ] @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath8 all have dimension @xmath47 .",
    "it is important to note that the variable transformation @xmath54 is globally valid since the jacobian determinant is given by @xmath55 .",
    "one can make a similar globally valid transformation which brings the constraint to the form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is determined by @xmath0 .",
    "] thus the constraint equation   makes it explicitly clear that the reduced vacuum state space is a 2-dimensional double cone with a joint apex , see figure  [ fig : lightcone_ss ] .",
    "the flow on this state space is determined by the following evolution equations : @xmath58    it follows from   that the two state space cones , defined by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are disconnected invariant subsets with a fixed point @xmath61 , as their common apex .",
    "this fixed point , @xmath62 , represents the minkowski solution , since @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath62 is the _ only _ fixed point on the physical state space and that it is non - hyperbolic ( note that this is consistent with   when specialized to the present case ) .    since the original system is invariant under the transformation @xmath22 , the system   is invariant under the transformation @xmath64 .",
    "it therefore suffices to investigate the dynamics on the invariant future state space light cone with @xmath59 in order to obtain a complete picture of the dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the definition   in combination with the constraint   implies that @xmath65 on the future state space light cone , i.e. , it is arguably the future state space light cone that is of cosmological interest . for these reasons we will only explicitly describe the dynamics on this part of the global state space .",
    "it is clear from the above system that the minimum @xmath66 on the future state space light cone @xmath59 only holds on the line @xmath67 , @xmath68 , but @xmath69 is not an invariant subset ( except at @xmath62 ) . indeed , since when @xmath69 and @xmath59 @xmath70 it follows that when @xmath66 then @xmath8 is passing through zero from negative to positive values .    to understand the present models it is essential to investigate if there are solutions that come from the future state space null infinity . as a next step we therefore aim at producing a regular system of equations on a compact state space .",
    "furthermore , the variables need to be dimensionless so that we eliminate the specific appearance of @xmath71 , which thereby automatically shows that this parameter is not essential for the solution structure of the present models ( this should not come as a surprise since it is possible to use units to set e.g. @xmath72 ) .    removing the minkowski fixed point @xmath61 from the analysis , we first introduce two new dimensionless variables @xmath73 which are bounded thanks to the constraint  .",
    "we then use that @xmath74 is dimensionless and positive on the future state space null cone and introduce the bounded variable @xmath75 next , to obtain a regular dimensionless system of evolution equations we introduce a new dimensionless time variable @xmath76 , defined by @xmath77 which leads to    [ dynsystxs ] @xmath78,\\\\ x^{\\prime } & = s\\left[t(3+x ) + ( 1-t)(1-x)s\\right ] , \\\\ s^{\\prime } & = -x\\left[t(3+x)+ ( 1-t)(1-x)s\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath76 , subjected to the constraint @xmath80    note that the above variable change from @xmath81 to @xmath82 amounts to a projection where all circles on the light cone with constant @xmath83 now become the unit circle given by @xmath84 , where the different circles are parameterized by the value of @xmath85 , i.e , the above variables cover all of the future state space light cone . has been chosen in order to simplify the comparison with the einstein frame state space .",
    "the reason for defining @xmath85 as a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath83 instead of a monotonically increasing one , e.g. , by setting @xmath86 , is that the minkowski state , as we will prove , is the future asymptotic state of all solutions , and that this definition also makes the transition to the variables we use to describe the einstein frame state space more convenient . ]",
    "the present state space @xmath87 , which is just the future state space light cone , is given by a finite cylinder determined by @xmath88 because the state space @xmath87 is relatively compact ( i.e. its closure is compact ) and the equations are completely regular , we can extend the state space @xmath87 to include the invariant boundaries @xmath89 , and @xmath90 to obtain an extended compact state space @xmath91 .",
    "this turns out to be essential since , as we will see , the asymptotic states for all solutions within the physical state space @xmath87 reside on these invariant boundary subsets , see figure  [ fig : vacuumjf ] below . indeed , we will prove that there are no fixed points or periodic orbits in the physical interior state space .",
    "thus , all solutions in @xmath87 originate from fixed points on @xmath89 ( the future null infinity of the future state space light cone ) , and end at a limit cycle on @xmath90 ( which describes how all solutions asymptotically approach the minkowski space - time ) .",
    "thus the present variables represent a compactification of the future state space light cone , where they blow up the neighborhood of the non - hyperbolic minkowski fixed point in the dynamical system for @xmath92 , thereby yielding a correct description of how all solutions approach the future asymptotic minkowski state .",
    "it is of interest to express @xmath20 in terms of @xmath93 :    @xmath94    these equations reveal that @xmath17 is not only zero on the invariant boundary @xmath90 , but also when @xmath95 , @xmath96 , which corresponds to the line @xmath67 , @xmath68 on the future state space light cone . since this is not an invariant subset of the dynamical system  , the solution trajectories pass through @xmath95 , going from positive to negative @xmath97 .",
    "indeed , we will show later on that all solutions pass through @xmath95 , @xmath96 infinitely many times .    finally ,",
    "although   is a constrained system , the constraint   is easily globally solved by introducing @xmath98 which results in the following unconstrained regular system of equations :    [ jordan2ddynsys ] @xmath99 , \\\\",
    "\\theta^{\\prime } & = -t(3 + \\cos{\\theta } ) - ( 1-t)(1 - \\cos{\\theta})\\sin{\\theta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above regular global dynamical system form our ` master equations ' for dealing with the present models in the jordan frame .",
    "however , since the present formulation differs substantially from the ones in the literature it is of interest to take a look at some other formulations for the jordan frame and make comparisons , which we do in section  [ sec : disc ] and in appendix  [ app : systems ] .",
    "finally , we stress that the above system was possible because we adapted the variables to the particular state space properties of the present models ; other models need different variables .",
    "however , to find one ( or more ) set(s ) of ( differentiably overlapping ) useful variables covering the entire state space and its possible infinite limits , one needs to go through the same steps of ( i ) state space analysis and ( ii ) state space adapted coordinates as for the present illustrative example .",
    "next we turn to illustrating ( iii ) : local and global dynamical systems analysis .      in this subsection",
    "we perform a local analysis of the fixed points of our new regular dynamical system   on the compactified global state space , with a focus on necessary non - linear aspects .",
    "as we will prove below , all fixed points are located on the boundary subset @xmath89 , associated with @xmath100 .",
    "considering this subset , we find that there are two fixed points :    [ fpvacumjordan ] @xmath101    with @xmath102 an integer .",
    "the motivation for the nomenclature for these fixed points will be made clear below .",
    "the fixed point @xmath103 is a hyperbolic source , while @xmath104 has two zero eigenvalues .",
    "more precisely , it is nilpotent of first degree .",
    "such fixed points are dealt with by means of so - called blow up techniques , described in detail in  @xcite and  @xcite . in order to bring the problem to standard form for nilpotent fixed points",
    "we first scale the variables @xmath105 and @xmath85 and introduce the following notation ( without loss of generality , we choose the representation @xmath106 for the fixed point @xmath104 ) : @xmath107 this leads to a dynamical system on the form    2 x^ & = y + p(x , y ) ; & p(x , y ) & = a(x ) + b(x)y , + y^ & = q(x , y ) ; & q(x , y ) & = c(x)y + d(x)y^2 + e(x)y^3 ,    where    2 a(x ) & = -(1- ) , & b(x ) & = -(1-)(1- ) , + c(x ) & = ( 1-)^2 , & d(x ) & = -((x)+2(1-)^2 ) , + e(x)&= ( + ( 1-)^2 ) . & &    next we introduce a new variable @xmath108 instead of @xmath109 : @xmath110 which leads to @xmath111 in the neighborhood of the origin this means that the dynamical system takes the form    @xmath112    where    @xmath113    we now proceed by making the following so - called blow - up transformation @xmath114 and change time variable by dividing the right hand sides by @xmath115 .",

    "it follows that on the @xmath120 subset there are two fixed points    @xmath121    the fixed point @xmath122 is a hyperbolic saddle while @xmath123 is a non - hyperbolic fixed point with eigenvalues zero and @xmath124 .    to deal with @xmath123",

    "we will prove that the one - parameter set of solutions that enter the physical state space from @xmath103 , and the single solution that comes from @xmath104 , all of them originating from a singular state at @xmath100 ( i.e. , at future null infinity with respect to the light cone state space ) , constitute all solutions in the physical state space .",

    "the negative eigenvalue corresponds to a stable subspace @xmath300 given by the invariant subset @xmath264 , which thereby coincides with the tangential stable subset @xmath214 , while the center manifold @xmath125 has a tangential subspace @xmath215 , described by :          which implies that in a neighborhood of @xmath123 the center manifold is described by the graph @xmath303 . from   it",
    "follows that @xmath304 obeys the first order differential equation @xmath305 which is solved approximately for @xmath306 by a formal series expansion , which results in @xmath307,\\ ] ] as @xmath308 .",
    "let us now consider an example of another dynamical systems treatment of @xmath0 flat rw cosmology which can be found in  @xcite , where the following variables ( when restricted to the present vacuum case ) are defined : @xmath309 viewing this as a variable transformation from @xmath310 to @xmath20 leads to the jacobian determinant @xmath311 the variables thereby break down at @xmath68 , @xmath66 , and @xmath312 , i.e. , at the boundary of the state space of the einstein frame .",
    "it brings parts of the future null infinity of the state space to finite values of the variables , but other regions , such as the generic one close to the minkowski fixed point , are now shifted to infinity in these unbounded variables . in the present case",
    "it follows that the auxiliary quantity @xmath313 in  @xcite is given by @xmath314 , which when using a time variable @xmath261 leads to the evolution equations      subjected to the constraint @xmath316 which can be solved globally for one of the variables .",
    "it is clear that not only has the system an unbounded incomplete state space , but the equations are also irregular as the right hand side blows up on the line @xmath317 , @xmath318 .",
    "to conclude , the system is inappropriate for a global analysis of the problem , but it is still possible to do some local analysis . to accomplish this ,",
    "let us solve for one of the variables , e.g. , @xmath319 ( which variable we solve for does not change any conclusions ) , and look for fixed points .",
    "since @xmath320 appears in the denominator ( writing the right hand sides of @xmath321 and @xmath322 with @xmath320 as a common denominator shows that it is impossible to get rid of this denominator ) , the equations are not defined for @xmath317 and hence fixed points must have @xmath323 .",
    "there are two fixed points : @xmath324 : @xmath325 and @xmath326 : @xmath327 .",
    "the vacuum fixed point @xmath328 in  @xcite is not defined for the present models , since it is associated with numerators and denominators in the equations that simultaneously are zero .",
    "furthermore , @xmath329 in  @xcite only exists when it coincides with @xmath324 , for which @xmath330 .",
    "note that the definitions   implies that @xmath324 corresponds to the asymptotic limit @xmath147 and @xmath331 .",
    "in fact @xmath332 which implies @xmath331 and @xmath100 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath326 on the other hand implies that @xmath147 and @xmath333 .",
    "this is because @xmath334 which implies that @xmath335 and hence @xmath147 .",
    "thus both fixed points correspond to part of future null infinity of the state space light cone .",
    "note that @xmath326 is associated with the boundary of the einstein frame .",
    "the fixed point @xmath336 corresponds to @xmath146 and is a non - hyperbolic fixed point with one negative value and one zero eigenvalue with an associated center manifold , corresponding to the @xmath123 fixed point for @xmath263 and @xmath139 .",
    "it therefore gives similar results , but the more complicated dynamical system leads to unnecessary technical complications .",
    "the situation for @xmath143 when @xmath147 , is , however , worse . in this case",
    "@xmath337 is a hyperbolic saddle , which is associated with a coordinate singularity due to the break down of   at @xmath338 . because of this breakdown , @xmath337 yields a solution that comes from a particular direction from future null infinity of the physical state , namely @xmath339 , thereby missing the one - parameter set of solutions that originates from there into the physical state space .",
    "thus a fixed point analysis in these variables does not show that there actually is a one - parameter set of solutions that originate from the limit @xmath143 and @xmath100 , which covers all solutions except the single solution from @xmath123 .",
    "next we comment on a previous attempt to provide a compact state space , given in  @xcite . in this work",
    "it was assumed that @xmath340 and @xmath341 , where the latter follows from the first condition in our case .",
    "the variables the authors introduced were given by @xmath342 where @xmath343^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "for the vacuum case one can solve for @xmath109 and @xmath263 to obtain a system of evolution equations for @xmath344 and @xmath292 .",
    "the authors also introduce an auxiliary quantity @xmath345 , which for the present case can be written as @xmath346 explicitly inserting this into the equations in  @xcite ( which we refrain from giving because of their considerable complexity ) shows that they have @xmath347 in the denominator , which means that the equations are non - regular and break down at @xmath348 and at @xmath349 .",
    "this result , in combination with the fact that the variables only compactify the @xmath340 part of the state space , and that @xmath68 is not an invariant subset on the physical state space ( except for at the minkowski fixed point ) , unfortunately leads to complications and some erroneous conclusions ( due to a breakdown of the time variable in  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , as we have proven , all solutions pass through @xmath68 infinitely many times , in contrast to what is claimed in  @xcite .",
    "this example illustrates that compactifications must respect the structure of the state space ; if one chooses to compactify only part of it there will be coordinate singularities associated with the boundary one chooses for the compactification , unless it is associated with an invariant subset in the original jordan state space for @xmath20 .",
