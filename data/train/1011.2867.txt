    "the outer atmosphere of the sun , the solar corona , is most clearly discernible when seen in soft x - rays . since the early rocket experiments in the late 1960s",

    "onboard _ hinode _ is a successor of the _ yohkoh_/sxt .",
    "it also employs grazing - incidence optics , but with improved spatial resolution ( consistent with 1@xmath0 ccd pixel size compared with @xmath1  2.5@xmath0 pixel size in the case of sxt ) while maintaining similar exposure cadence to that of sxt ( only order of few milli - seconds for flare and order of few seconds for active region ) .",
    "the xrt has the capability of imaging emission formed at much longer wavelengths than sxt .",
    "the combination of a backside thinned ccd and thin al - mesh filter allow xrt to image emission significantly longward of 60   .",
    "this is a major difference from _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt in that the xrt can observe not only high - temperature plasmas ( @xmath2 2  mk ) seen with sxt , but also low - temperature ( @xmath3 2  mk , reaching even below 1  mk ) plasmas which comprise a significant amount of the corona . with this enhanced temperature range for observing coronal plasmas , coupled with increased spatial resolution ,",
    "the xrt is able to perform detailed imaging observations of a wide variety of coronal plasmas in a temperature range covering , continuously , from below 1  mk to well above 10  mk .",
    "one of the most significant scientific features of the xrt is its coronal - temperature - diagnostic capability , namely capability to make temperature maps , for such plasmas .    in order to have xrt perform coronal temperature diagnostics with its full capability",
    ", we carefully calibrated the effective area of the xrt and its response to coronal temperatures using not only ground - based test data but also on - orbit data observed in x - rays and visible light .",
    "the effect of the on - orbit contamination , which manifested itself as decreasing intensity of the sun s corona with time as imaged by xrt , was also calibrated as accurately as possible . on the basis of our calibration results ,",

    "however , some of the calibrated fpafs were unfortunately damaged . in this article",

    "in order to describe in detail the calibrations performed on the xrt , we first briefly describe the optical elements .",
    "figure  [ fig : optical elements ] shows the optical elements and optical paths of xrt .",
    "the xrt can take not only x - ray images but also visible light ( g - band ) images for co - aligning images between xrt and other instruments mounted on _",
    "the solid and dashed lines in figure  [ fig : optical elements ] show the optical paths in x - rays and visible light , respectively .    the xrt optical elements for x - rays consist of pre - filter ( pf ) , two grazing - incidence mirrors ( m1 and m2 ) , two focal - plane analysis filters ( fpaf1 and fpaf2 ) , and ccd .",
    "* the pre - filter consists of eight fan - shaped annular filter segments each made of thin aluminum on a polyimide film ( figure  [ fig : pf ] ) , which were manufactured by luxel corporation .",
    "the aperture shape was designed to obscure the locations of mirror - bonding pads to avoid possible degradation in image quality caused by surface deformation of the mirror at the bonding pads . in figure",

    "the average pre - filter consists of 1538   al and 2030   polyimide based on the measurement by manufacturer .",
    "* the m1 and m2 mirrors are grazing - incidence annular mirror manufactured by goodrich , each made of zerodur . on the basis of measurements by the manufacturer , the annular entrance aperture of the xrt primary mirror is located between radii of @xmath7 = 17.042446  cm and @xmath8 = 17.074051  cm . considering the open angle of pre - filter ( 242.04@xmath9 , see figure  [ fig : pf ] ) , the geometric aperture area of xrt",
    "is calculated to be @xmath10 = 2.28  @xmath11 .",
    "the grazing angle of x - rays at each xrt mirror is about 0.91@xmath9 on average .",
    "* xrt has two filter wheels : fw1 and fw2 .",
    "each filter wheel has six positions to mount focal - plane analysis filters ( fpafs ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fw ] , five x - ray analysis filters are mounted on fw1 , and fw2 has four x - ray filters and one filter for visible - light observation ( g - band ) .",
    "these nine x - ray filters are made of several kinds of metal and support , with different thicknesses as summarized in table  [ tbl : fpaf ] .",
    "the filters are designed to observe the corona in a temperature range from less than 1  mk to more than 10  mk .",
    "focal - plane analysis filters on fw1 and fw2 ( hereafter fpaf1 and fpaf2 , respectively ) can be selected independently , even allowing combinations of filters both from fw1 and fw2 in series . *",
    "x - rays are focused on a back - illuminated ccd @xcite .    the effective area [ @xmath12 of xrt is defined by the product of the geometric aperture area [ @xmath13 and the efficiency of all of the optical elements : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the transmission of the pre - filter , @xmath16 and @xmath17 reflectivities at the primary and secondary mirrors , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the transmissions of fpaf1 and fpaf2 , and @xmath20 the quantum efficiency of the ccd . because each efficiency is a function of wavelength , @xmath21 is also a function of wavelength . in this article , we calibrate @xmath15 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , and then derive the effective area .",

    "the visible light is focused onto the same ccd as x - rays ( figure  [ fig : optical elements ] ) .",
    "x - rays can not reach the ccd through the g - band ( dotted line ) or the x - ray ( solid line ) paths , because those x - rays are blocked by g - band filters employed at the front of the xrt and on fw2 , respectively .",

    "the errors shown by gray areas in figure  [ fig : xrcf spectrum ] are estimated from the photon noise and the energy range of fpc data points .",
    "for example , the error bars in o - k and c - k line are larger than for the other lines , because the total photon number is small in the o - k line case , and because the energy range of the c - k line does not completely cover the continuum .",
    "the photon - number fluxes of characteristic x - ray lines and continua are summarized in table  [ tbl : xrcf comp ] .",
    "the contribution of continuum is not negligible even for the al - k line .",
    "the support of the al - mesh filter is a stainless steel mesh .",
    "figure  [ fig : mesh ] is a picture of the mesh taken by the filter manufacturer with a high - precision digital microscope .",
    "according to the manufacturer , the width of the mesh wire and the open area are 38  @xmath23 m and 330  @xmath23 m , respectively . on the basis of this measurement ,",
    "the open area occupies 77% of whole area .",
    "we adopt this measured value of 77% for the geometrical open area .    here",
    "we define  annulus transmission \" as the fraction of the x - rays passed though the open area of the mesh to the incident x - rays into the mesh .",
    "note that the x - rays pass through the open area without any loss of intensity , while at the wires , the x - rays are completely blocked .",
    "hence , the average of annulus transmission should be consistent with the geometrical open area of the mesh .",
    "the annulus transmission is not uniform and depends on the relative position of the shape of x - rays on the filter with respect to the mesh pattern .",
    "however , we do not know this relative position for the flight xrt .",
    "instead , we derive distribution of the annulus transmission for all possible relative positions , take the average of the distribution as the annulus transmission of the al - mesh filter , and employ the deviation of the distribution as that for the annulus transmission . the procedure is detailed in the following .",
    "the shape of x - rays imaged on the fpafs is an annulus , because the shape of the xrt aperture is an annulus ( see figure  [ fig : pf ] ) .",
    "the radius and width of annular x - ray image are about 4.1  mm and 7.6  @xmath23 m on the fpafs , respectively , because the radius and width of xrt annular aperture , focal length , and distance between focus position and fpaf are about 170  mm , 0.32  mm , 2700  mm , and 65  mm , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : mesh trans image ] shows some schematic examples of the relationship between the annular x - ray image and the mesh .",
    "the gray area indicates the mesh of al - mesh filter and the black ring shows the x - ray annulus on the filter .",
    "the variation in annulus transmission is shown in figure  [ fig : mesh trans ] .",
    "the left panel shows a cell ( unit opening ) of the mesh .",
    "the width and height of this cell are both 368  @xmath23 m on the basis of manufacturer s measurement .",
    "the black and white regions indicate mesh wire and open area , respectively .",
    "the right panel shows the annulus transmission in gray scale at the position where the center of the annular x - ray image is located at the corresponding left panel .",
    "figure  [ fig : mesh trans histogram ] shows distribution of the annulus transmission over the varying center position of the x - ray annulus with respect to the mesh pattern ( this is the histogram of calculated annulus transmission in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mesh trans ] ) .",
    "the average of annulus transmission is consistent with the geometrical open area of the mesh .",
    "however , the annulus transmission has a scatter with the standard deviation @xmath24 of 2.3% .",
    "this @xmath24 is also considered in the calibration of al - mesh filter thickness .",
    "the uncertainty in the annulus transmission originated from the known relative position of the annulus center with respect to the mesh pattern can thus be evaluated in this way . in this evaluation",
    ", we assumed that the shape of the x - ray image on the filter is a perfect annulus .",
    "but , in reality , the shape corresponds to the colored area in figure  [ fig : pf ] and is not symmetrical .",
    "hence , we should consider not only the relative position but also the relative angle between the patterns along the image annulus and the direction of the mesh wires , which is also not known . in order to assess the amount of additional uncertainty caused by this",
    ", we calculated the scatter of annulus transmission due to the uncertainty of the relative position and angle .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath25 of this scatter ( imperfect annulus case ) turned out to be almost the same as @xmath26 ( perfect annulus case ) .",
    "hence , we claim our treating the image shape as a perfect annulus is sufficient for deriving the average fraction and @xmath24 of the annulus transmission for the x - ray image on the al - mesh filter .",
    "after the first bakeout , spot - like patterns appeared in both x - ray and g - band data as shown in figure  [ fig : spot ] .",
    "subsequent analyses indicated that the estimated thickness of contaminant on the ccd was more than 3000   before the first bakeout ( see figure  [ fig : contam on ccd ] ) .",
    "the patterns most likely originate from the condensation of contaminant and are triggered by a bakeout with the thickness of the contaminants accumulated on the ccd exceeding a certain threshold value ( the value itself is not known ) .",
    "these spots were not removed at all even with the second bakeout that was performed after the first bakeout and lasted for a month .",
    "the ratio of spot area to full ccd area was 2.6% at this point ( see table  [ tbl : bakeout ] ) .",
    "as it took five months before we agreed , as the instrument team , to proceed with performing the next ( third ) bakeout , the resultant thickness of the contaminants again exceeded 3000   , reaching even beyond 3500   ( see figure  [ fig : contam on ccd ] ) .",
    "this resulted in the creation of additional contamination spots across the ccd , with an increased spot area ratio of 5.2% .",
    "note , however , this additional increase was rather an intentional one ; we took the option of keeping a low - temperature diagnostic capability by removing the accumulated contaminants while accepting an increase in the spot area .",
    "the resultant spot distribution is indicated by the black areas in figure  [ fig : spot map ] . after the third ccd bakeout",
    ", we regularly perform the bakeout every three to four weeks . as we guessed , no more spots were created after the third bakeout as shown in table  [ tbl : bakeout ] .",
    "the ratio of spot area to full - ccd area has kept to be 5.2% .",
    "we investigate the relation between the thickness of some spots measured with their newton - ring patterns in g - band and the absorbed x - ray intensities by such spots , and conclude that the material of spot contaminant is most likely the same material as the laminar contaminant .",
    "this result will be presented as a separate paper with more detailed analysis .",
    "in appendix  [ subsubsec : contam monitor method ] , in order to measure the contaminant thickness on the ccd , we used the transmission of visible light into the ccd through contamination layers , equation  ( [ eq : t_g ] ) . here , we derive this equation .    the reflected and transmitted amplitudes [ @xmath27 and @xmath28 of rays at a boundary of two layers whose refractive indexes are @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "are written as @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the amplitude of incident rays from the @xmath29 layer to the boundary .",
    "we consider transmission of three layers as shown in figure  [ fig : contam ccd ] . here",
    ", we define @xmath33 as the amplitude of incident rays in vacuum ( @xmath29 layer ) , and @xmath34 the complex amplitude of rays which are reflected @xmath35 times at the borders of layers ( @xmath29@xmath30 border and @xmath30@xmath36 border ) and transmitted into the ccd ( @xmath36 layer ) .",
    "note the amplitudes of rays shown by white and black arrows in figure  [ fig : contam ccd ] are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath34 is expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) gives the phase difference between @xmath34 and @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the total amplitude [ @xmath43 of incident rays into the ccd is derived as @xmath44^{-1 } .",
    "\\label{eq : a_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the relation between amplitude @xmath45 and intensity @xmath46 in a layer of refractive index @xmath47 given as @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes complex conjugate , the intensity @xmath50 in vacuum ( @xmath29 layer in figure  [ fig : contam ccd ] ) is @xmath51 and the total intensity @xmath52 detected by the ccd is @xmath53 equation  ( [ eq : t_g ] ) is derived from equations  ( [ eq : a_t ] ) , ( [ eq : i_n1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : i_t ] ) .",
    "when the molecular formula of pure metal and oxidized metal are x and x@xmath54o@xmath55 , and the molecular weight of x and o are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , the reduced thickness [ @xmath58 of pure metal by the creation of oxidized metal with a thickness of @xmath59 is derived to be @xmath60 based on the conservation of the number of metal atoms .",
    "the information about materials used in our calibration is summarized in table  [ tbl : material ] .",
    "the photon noise can be derived with equation  ( [ eq : sigma_i ] ) . for the condition  ( b ) in section  [ subsec : suitable filter pair ] , we investigated how much photon noise is expected in the observed data with the single temperature of the filter - ratio temperature .",
    "however , the actual solar corona may have a multi - temperature structures .",
    "hence , here we discuss the meaning of photon noise estimate with the filter - ratio temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : filter ratio temperature ] shows the correlation between the fractional photon noise derived with dem [ @xmath61 and with the filter - ratio temperature [ @xmath62 for four dems ( regions ) summarized in table  [ tbl : coronal structure ] .",
    "@xmath63 is the photon noise calculated with the filter - ratio temperature [ @xmath64 and equation  ( [ eq : sigma_i ] ) .",
    "@xmath65 is the photon noise derived with the dem as following steps : _ i _ ) we calculate the photon noise [ @xmath66 for each temperature bin of dem with equation  ( [ eq : sigma_i ] ) .",
    "_ ii _ ) we derive the net photon noise of step  _ i _ ) as @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath65 is calculated for all filters which are included in the suitable filter pairs in figure  [ fig : suitable filter pair 800 ] with the typical values of coronal structures in table  [ tbl : coronal structure ] . on the basis of this figure",
    ", we can say that @xmath63 well matches @xmath65 which is the actual photon noise .",
    "this equality can be understood as following : since the amount of plasma at the dem peak is dominant , its photon noise mainly affects @xmath65 .",
    "in the temperature range where the dem peak is located , the conversion factor [ @xmath68 from observed dn to @xmath69 ( see equation  [ eq : sigma_i ] ) is almost constant for the filters which are included in the suitable filter pairs ( see figures  [ fig : suitable filter pair 0 ] and [ fig : suitable filter pair 800 ] ) .",
    "for example , in a temperature range of 34  mk where the active region has the dem peak ( see figure  [ fig : filter pair2 ] ) , @xmath70 for al - poly , ti - poly , and med - be filters varies within factors of 1.07 , 1.11 , and 1.02 , respectively ( see the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : k ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath65 well matches @xmath63 , since @xmath63 is derived from @xmath70 at @xmath71 , and @xmath71 is close to the dem peak temperature ( see section  [ subsec : filter ratio temperature ] ) .",
    "we note that , for temperature ranges other than the dem peak , @xmath70 varies with a factor of typically 24 .",
    "however , since _ i _ )",
    "the photon noise is a function of @xmath72 ( see equation  [ eq : sigma_i ] ) and furthermore , _ ii _ ) in this temperature range , the contribution of photon noise to @xmath65 is smaller than at the dem peak , the variation of @xmath70 in these temperature ranges does not significantly affect @xmath65 .",
    "in appendix  [ subsubsec : x - ray analysis in phase 3 ] , we identified the contaminant material as a long - chain organic compound whose chemical composition , density , and refractive index are similar to those of dehp , although dehp is not used in the xrt .",
    "this means that the actual contaminant material is narrowed down to the material whose refractive index and density are close to 1.5 and 1  g  @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "next let us discuss the chemical composition of the actual contaminant material .",
    "since the atomic number of silicon is about two times larger than carbon and oxygen , _",
    "i.e. _ the cross - section of silicon to x - rays is certainly larger , the existence of silicon affects on the x - ray transmission certainly .",
    "in fact , when we assume that the contaminant contains some silicon atoms , the discrepancy between the observed and expected x - ray intensity ratios rises as shown in figure  [ fig : x - ray si filter contam ] .",
    "hence , we conclude that there are no silicon atoms in the contaminant material .",
    "on the other hand , since the atomic numbers of carbon and oxygen ( also nitrogen ) are comparable and that of hydrogen is much smaller than carbon and oxygen , _",
    "i.e. _ hydrogen is much more transparent to x - rays , some slight differences in numbers of such atoms among a long - chain organic compound do not make any significant difference in the transmission of x - rays .",
    "hence , although we can not exactly identify the chemical composition of the contaminant material , it is acceptable for the calibration of the xrt that we tentatively employed dehp as the contaminant material .",
    "we note that the identified property of the contaminant , where chemical composition is a long - chain organic compound without silicon , refractive index is @xmath1  1.5 , and density is @xmath1  1  g  @xmath73 , is a common property of materials which are widely used for satellites , and which are well known as possible source of contamination .      in appendix",
    "[ subsubsec : contam monitor method ] , we explained the method to measure the thickness of contaminant on the ccd using g - band data .",
    "the g - band intensity oscillation shown in figure  [ fig : g - band 2nd bake ] is essentially expressed by equation  ( [ eq : anti - refraction ] ) .",
    "however , there are two differences between the calculated g - band intensity enhancement with the anti - reflection effect of equation  ( [ eq : anti - refraction ] ) and the observed one that is characterized by the empirical model given by equation  ( [ eq : empirical model ] ) .      * in appendix  [ subsubsec : measurement of contam thickness on ccd ] , from the observed amplitude of intensity enhancement in g - band , the refractive index of contaminant is estimated as @xmath1  1.4 . * in appendix  [ subsubsec : x - ray analysis in phase 3 ] , the decrease in x - ray intensities caused by the accumulation of contaminant can be well explained by adopting a well - known material whose refractive index and density of contaminant are 1.5 and 0.986  g  @xmath73 , respectively , as the contaminant material .",
    "this difference may be explained with the possible hypothesis where the density of actually - accumulated contaminant is lower than the contaminant in its usual state ( as , _",
    "e.g. _ , products ) , because the contaminant material is an organic compound and its accumulation was formed under vacuum deposition process but with much slower rate than standard ones in laboratories , and the accumulated contaminant most likely consists of sparsely - structured molecules ( rather than the dense crystalline structure ) .",
    "hereafter , we call this state as sparse state .",
    "the same trend as this hypothesis is seen in the case of c - poly filter as described in the last paragraph of appendix  [ subsec : calibration of fpaf ]",
    ". generally , the refractive index [ @xmath74 and density [ @xmath75 of material in sparse state are smaller than those ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) in the usual state .",
    "if the above hypothesis holds , the method  _ i _ ) gives the refractive index of contaminant in sparse state .",
    "on the other hand , in method  _ ii _ ) , we identified the refractive index and density in usual state from among the possible candidates of contaminant ( see table  [ tbl : contaminant ] ) .",
    "hence , the difference in the refractive indexes in methods  _ i _ ) and _ ii _ ) is caused by the different state of the contaminant .",
    "next , we consider the effect of this difference on the calibration results . on the basis of equation  ( [ eq : osc ] )",
    ", the smaller refractive index gives the thicker contaminant .",
    "meanwhile , the smaller density gives the longer attenuation length [ @xmath78 in equation  ( [ eq : t ] ) .",
    "hence , the x - ray transmission calculated with @xmath79 and @xmath80 would be close to the transmission with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we note that even if the actual state of contaminant is not sparse , _",
    "i.e. _ even if the density of actual contaminant is the same as the usual state , the difference in refractive indexes ( 1.4 and 1.5 ) is only 7% , and then the difference in the estimated thickness of contaminant on the ccd is also 7% .",
    "since the maximum thickness of contaminant is about 3600   ( see figure  [ fig : contam on ccd ] ) , the maximum error in the estimate is about 250   .",
    "this error is smaller than the accumulated thickness of contaminant on the thinner fpafs ( see figure  [ fig : contam on fpaf ] ) , and is negligibly small against the metal thicknesses of the thicker filters . hence , we conclude that , whether the hypothesis holds or not , the difference in refractive indexes does not significantly affect the results of xrt calibration , and adopt @xmath81 and @xmath82  g  @xmath73 for the calibration .    the second one is the decay of oscillation amplitude .",
    "we consider that this is caused by the inhomogeneous accumulation rate of the contaminant . in appendix",
    "[ subsubsec : spatial distribution ] , we demonstrated the accumulation rate of contaminant at the ccd center is larger than at the edges of the ccd .",
    "this effect might appear in the 512  @xmath83  512 pixels data which is used to make the g - band intensity plot ( figure  [ fig : g - band 2nd bake ] ) .",
    "the difference of accumulation rate will result in an asynchronous phase in the intensity oscillation across the 512  @xmath83  512 pixels .",
    "the g - band intensity plot is the average of such different oscillations which are sine curves with different phases .",
    "because the phase difference becomes larger and larger as time passes , the oscillation amplitude of the g - band intensity enhancement decays .    on the basis of equation  ( [ eq : osc ] ) ,",
    "the thickness of contaminant on the ccd is derived from only the refractive index of the contaminant and the period of the intensity oscillation .",
    "hence , we expect that the refractive index of @xmath1  1.5 and the oscillation period in figure  [ fig : g - band 2nd bake ] give the average thickness of contaminant on the ccd area of 512  @xmath83  512 pixels , which is reliable enough for the xrt calibration .",
    "when we estimated the thickness of the contaminant accumulated on the ccd with the visible light intensity profile ( appendix  [ subsubsec : measurement of contam thickness on ccd ] ) , we assumed a constant accumulation rate for the contaminant between two successive bakeouts .",
    "however , actually , we see rapid accumulation of contaminant right after the ccd bakeout while for the rest of each period the rate is almost constant ( see right panel of figure  [ fig:6th bakeout ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the assumption of constant accumulation for the entire period between two successive bakeouts is a valid one for the calculation of the xrt effective area , because the contaminants accumulated on the fpafs are much thicker than the difference between the actual and estimated thickness with the above assumption , _ i.e. _ such difference is negligible .      in appendix  [ subsec : contam analysis with x - ray ] , we calibrated the contaminant thickness on the fpafs with the observed x - ray data and dem in the quiet sun .",
    "when we performed the calibrations described in this article , the dem model in the quiet sun derived by was the latest result available .",
    "hence , we adopted their dem model for our analysis .",
    "derived the dem of quiet sun from a data set taken with _",

    "the profiles of dems studied in these two papers are very similar up to at least @xmath84  k in all cases .",
    "we confirmed that the calibrated contaminant thicknesses on the fpafs with the dems from and are consistent with each other .",
    "we found that there is remarkable similarity between the observed spatial distribution of the contaminant across the ccd and the simulated result by for the case where the contaminant was assumed to come from the direction in front of the ccd ( see figure  [ fig : contam rate map ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , we found that the contamination is triggered by the operational heater which warms the rear end of telescope tube up to about @xmath85c .",
    "on the basis of these circumstantial evidences , we suspect that the contaminant most likely originates from somewhere in front of the ccd , in the telescope tube .",
    "as we mentioned in appendix  [ subsec : calibration of fpaf ] , we consider that the calibration of thick filters ( med - be , thick - al and thick - be filters ) with ground - based test data is not ideal , though the difference between calibrated and actual x - ray transmission of them should be small . for further calibration of thick filters ,",
    "we need to take enough data sets where xrt observes intense x - ray sources , _",
    "e.g. _ , active regions and flares , with thick filters .",
    "calibration with on - orbit observation data is our future work .",
    "also , in order to supplement our calibration , we plan to perform the following cross - calibrations : _ i _ ) between _ hinode_/xrt and _ hinode_/eis , and _ ii _ ) between xrt and _ goes13_/sxi , which is the grazing incidence x - ray telescope like xrt .",

    "first of all , we are very much indebted to an extremely - talented team of people at xrcf led by c. reily and j. mccracken , including r. siler , e. wright , j. carpenter , j. keegley and g. zirnstein , and also m. baker , h. haight , b. hale , t. hill , b. hoghe , d. javins , j. norwood , h. rutledge , g. st . john , j. tucker , and d. watson . without their continuous and enormous support including preparation of ln2-cooled cold plate facing xrt radiators in the cryogenic chamber of xrcf , from early preparation phase of the xrcf experiment and throughout the experiment period",
    ", the filter calibration at xrcf would have been totally impossible .",
    "we are also grateful to people from sao who supported the xrcf measurement ; g. austin , w. podgorski , e. dennis , j. chappel , d. caldwell , w. martell , m. harris , m. cosmo , d. weaver , s. park and t. kent who participated in the experiment , and p. cheimets , j. bookbinder , j. boczenowski .",
