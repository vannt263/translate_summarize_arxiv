    "since the beginning of the space age , the earth s bow shock is of particular interest because it serves as a unique laboratory for the study of shock waves in collisionless plasmas .",
    "most of our understanding of structure , dynamics , and dissipation processes of such shocks has come from in situ spacecraft measurements crossing the bow shock .",
    "early observations of waves and particles upstream of the bow shock can be found in the special issue of the _ journal of geophysical research _ , _ 86 _ , pp . 43174536 [ 1981 ] . a collection of observational and theoretical work on the bow shock is contained in _ stone & tsurutani _ [ 1985 ] and _ tsurutani & stone _ [ 1985 ] .",
    "reviews focusing on the dissipation processes taking place at the earth s bow shock have been given by , e.g. , _ kennel et al_. [ 1985 ] and , more recently , by _",
    "omidi _ [ 1995 ] .",
    "plasma wave observations across the bow shock in the high frequency range have been reviewed by _",
    "gurnett _ [ 1985 ] .",
    "_ schwartz et al_. [ 1996 ] have reviewed results concerning low frequency waves in the magnetosheath region behind the bow shock .",
    "many of the previous measurements have demonstrated that a large variety of nonthermal particles is generated at the bow shock . while nonthermal electrons can act as a source for high frequency waves , nonthermal ions can be responsible for low frequency waves .",
    "electrons and ions reflected at the shock stream sunward along the interplanetary magnetic field , thus forming the electron and ion foreshock , respectively .",
    "structure , dynamics , and dissipation processes of the bow shock vary considerably depending on the angle @xmath0 between the upstream magnetic field and the shock normal , on the plasma @xmath1 , i.e. , the ratio of plasma to magnetic pressure in the upstream region , and on the mach numbers @xmath7 or @xmath8 , i.e. , the ratios of the solar wind velocity along the shock normal to the upstream alfvn or magnetosonic speed . for quasi - perpendicular shocks with @xmath9 , the main transition from the solar wind to the magnetosheath is accomplished at a sharp ramp .",
    "in contrast , quasi - parallel shocks with @xmath2 consist of large - amplitude pulsations extending into the foreshock region . for larger mach numbers",
    "this pulsating structure continuously re - forms by virtue of collisions between convecting upstream waves and the shock [ _ burgess _ , 1989 ] or due to an instability at the interface between solar wind and heated downstream plasma [ _ winske et al_. , 1990 ] .",
    "two - fluid theories of shocks have indicated the presence of a critical magnetosonic mach number , @xmath10 , above which ion reflection is required to provide the necessary dissipation .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated by observations [ _ greenstadt & mellott _ , 1987 ; _ sckopke et al_. , 1990 ] that ion reflection occurs also below @xmath10 and that the distinction between subcritical ( @xmath11 ) and supercritical ( @xmath12 ) shocks is not sharp . whereas the ramp of quasi - perpendicular shocks at high mach numbers is preceded by a foot and followed by an overshoot , these features are less prominent at low mach numbers [ _ mellott & livesey _ , 1987 ] . while quasi - parallel shocks are steady at low alfvn mach numbers , @xmath13 , they become unsteady for higher mach numbers , where they continuously re - form [ _ krauss - varban & omidi _ , 1991 ] .",
    "an important role in the dissipation process is played by ions reflected at the bow shock . at quasi - parallel shocks",
    "they can escape from the shock into the foreshock region and drive ion beam instabilities .",
    "these instabilities may excite large - amplitude waves observed in the foreshock region , e.g. , by _ le & russell _ [ 1992 ] and _ blanco - cano & schwartz _ [ 1995 ] . at quasi - perpendicular shocks",
    "the reflected ions gyrate back to the shock and enter the downstream region , where their presence leads to a strong perpendicular temperature anisotropy [ _ sckopke et al_. , 1983 ] .",
    "this anisotropy leads to the generation of ion cyclotron and mirror waves [ e.g. , _ price et al .",
    "_ , 1986 ; _",
    "gary et al . _ , 1993 ] .",
    "these waves have been observed in the earth s magnetosheath , e.g. , by _ sckopke et al . _ [ 1990 ] and _ anderson et al . _",
    "[ 1993,1994 ] .",
    "closer to the magnetopause the mechanism of field line draping leads to the formation of anisotropic ion distributions and the formation of a plasma depletion layer .",
    "waves in this environment have also been described by _",
    "anderson et al .",

    "large - amplitude mirror waves have been observed in planetary magnetospheres , e.g. , by _ bavassano - cattaneo et al . _",

    "we investigate the average behavior of plasma and magnetic field parameters including the low frequency magnetic wave power as measured by ampte / irm during a fairly large number of bow shock crossings .",
    "we show that , as expected , quasi - perpendicular and quasi - parallel bow shocks behave differently even in their average properties .",
    "this difference has been quantified in our investigation .",
    "section 2 provides a short description of the available data .",
    "it is followed by section  3 which compares the properties of quasi - perpendicular and quasi - parallel shocks . in section 4",
    "low and high-@xmath1 bow shock crossings are compared for the quasi - perpendicular shock , and it is outlined why a classification by @xmath1 is preferred to a classification by mach number . finally , section  5 presents concluding remarks .",
    "the present analysis uses data from the ampte / irm satellite . from the periods when the apogee of ampte / irm was on the earth s dayside ( august  december 1984 and august 1985  january 1986 ) , we have selected all crossings of the satellite through the earth s bow shock in the local time interval 0700  1700 , whenever there was a reasonable amount of data measured on both sides of the bow shock , i.e. , at least 2min upstream and 4min downstream .",
    "altogether this gives 132 events , with some events belonging to multiple crossings due to the fast movement of the bow shock relative to the slowly moving satellite .",
    "due to the satellite s orbital parameters , all crossings occurred at low latitudes , i.e. , in the interval @xmath14 from the ecliptic plane .",
    "we analyze the data from the triaxial fluxgate magnetometer described by _",
    "lhr et al . _",
    "[ 1985 ] which gives the magnetic field vector at a rate of 32 samples per second .",
    "in addition , we use the plasma moments calculated from the three - dimensional particle distribution functions measured once every spacecraft revolution ( @xmath15 s ) by the plasma instrument [ _ paschmann et al . _ , 1985 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ positions ] we show the locations of the individual bow shock crossings rotated into the ecliptic along meridians .",
    "cases where the angle @xmath0 is less than @xmath16 , i.e. , quasi - parallel events , and cases where the angle @xmath0 is greater than @xmath16 , i.e. , quasi - perpendicular events , are shown in addition to the best fit hyperbola of _ fairfield _ [ 1971 ] using data from the imp 1 to 4 and explorer 33 and 35 spacecraft .",
    "it is found that most of the ampte / irm bow shock crossings occurred closer to the earth than fairfield s average bow shock . since we analyze only bow shock crossings on the dayside , the best fit hyperbola derived from our data is not reliable at the flanks .",
    "however , the distance of the subsolar point is well defined .",
    "we find a value of 12.3 @xmath17 , which is more than 2 @xmath17 closer to the earth than the value of 14.6 @xmath17 found by fairfield . in his study , _ formisano _ [ 1979 ] analyzed 1500 bow shock crossings .",
    "he normalized the observed distance @xmath18 of these crossings to an average value of the solar wind dynamical pressure using @xmath19 with a typical value of the solar wind speed @xmath20 km / s and particle density @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "he derived a distance of the subsolar point of 11.9 @xmath17 .",
    "applying the same normalization to the ampte / irm data , we find a value of 11.7 @xmath17 , which is in good agreement with the result of _ formisano _ [ 1979 ] .",
    "this indicates that the difference of the distance of the subsolar point between fairfield s and our study is due to different average solar wind dynamical pressure .",
    "we interpret this finding as a solar cycle effect since the ampte / irm data are obtained close to solar activity minimum , whereas fairfield s data set is from the years 1964 - 1968 , when solar activity increased from minimum to maximum . in solar minimum the earth",
    "is hit more frequently by high speed solar wind streams than in solar maximum .",
    "the high speed solar wind has , although less dense , a higher dynamical pressure than the slow solar wind .",
    "hence , the solar wind dynamical pressure is usually higher on average during solar minimum than during solar maximum [ _ fairfield _ , 1979 ] .",
    "in addition , during solar minimum , the heliospheric plasma sheet described by _ winterhalter et al . _ [ 1994 ] is fairly flat , i.e. , near the ecliptic plane . with its very high densities",
    "it can enhance the solar wind pressure although the solar wind velocity is only around 350 km / s .    in a more recent study , _ peredo et al . _ [ 1995 ] investigated 1392 bow shock crossings from 17 spacecraft during the years 19631979 , i.e. , one and a half solar cycles .",
    "they found a dependence on the alfvn mach number @xmath7 . with the average alfvn mach number @xmath23 of the ampte / irm data set the distance of the subsolar point should be in the range of 14.0 - 14.9 @xmath17 . performing a normalization with the average values of @xmath24 @xmath22 and @xmath25 km /",
    "s used by _",
    "peredo et al . _",
    "[ 1995 ] , the distance of the subsolar point of the ampte / irm data set is 12.1 @xmath17 . the results of _ peredo et al . _",
    "[ 1995 ] are thus not in agreement with our results and those of",
    "_ formisano _ [ 1979 ] .",
    "_ peredo et al . _ [ 1995 ] explain this disagreement with the fact that the study of _ formisano _ [ 1979 ] is biased by the dominance of the high latitude heos 2 bow shock crossing . however , our data are low - latitude and agree well with the results of _ formisano _ [ 1979 ] . in principle , the bow shock position depends on the magnetopause position and on the standoff distance between the magnetopause and the bow shock .",
    "whereas the magnetopause position depends only on the solar wind dynamical pressure , the standoff distance at a given mach number depends on the polytropic index @xmath26 ( _ spreiter et al . , _ 1966 ) .",
    "since our data were sampled at typical solar minimum conditions , the polytropic index might be different than in other phases of the solar cycle .",
    "this might contribute to the discrepancy .",
    "we divided the 132 events into 92 quasi - perpendicular ( @xmath27 ) and 40 quasi - parallel ( @xmath28 ) cases and compared the average behavior of plasma and magnetic field parameters and low frequency magnetic fluctuations of the two groups .    actually , for the quasi - parallel bow shock crossings @xmath0 varies substantially with time in the dynamic foreshock region .",
    "for these events the angle @xmath0 had to be averaged over a time interval of about 20 s further upstream to identify them with quasi - parallel shock crossings .",
    "the high level of fluctuations in the region upstream of the quasi - parallel bow shock is well known [ e.g. , _",
    "hoppe et al . _ , 1981 , _ greenstadt et al . , _ 1995 ] .",
    "in order to obtain the average behavior of plasma and magnetic field parameter at the bow shock , one would ideally need average spatial profiles of these parameters .",
    "however , with just one satellite and in a region with strong plasma flows and strong motions of the region itself , it is not unambiguously possible to translate the time profiles into spatial profiles . therefore we perform a superposed epoch analysis by averaging time profiles centered on the bow shock crossing time and consider the result as an approximation for the average spatial behavior .",
    "the time series are aligned on the keytime with the upstream always preceding , i.e. , for outbound crossings the time sequence had to be reversed .",
    "the keytime , i.e. , the bow shock crossing time , is identified with the steepest drop in the proton velocity .",
    "this drop is well defined for the quasi - perpendicular cases and corresponds , of course , to the shock ramp . due to the large - amplitude pulsations in the foreshock",
    ", the keytime can not as easily be found in the quasi - parallel cases .",
    "we therefore applied , as an additional criterion for the quasi - parallel events , that no solar wind - like plasma is allowed to be visible in the downstream region .",
    "as noted in section  1 , quasi - parallel shocks consist of large - amplitude pulsations associated with a sequence of partial transitions from solar wind - like to magnetosheath - like plasma and vice versa",
    ". thus our definition of the keytime implies that the keytime of quasi - parallel shocks corresponds to the downstream end of this pulsating transition region .",
    "we use data from 2min upstream to 4min downstream for the analysis of the plasma and magnetic field parameters and data from 3 min upstream to 9min downstream for the low frequency fluctuations , although not for all events such long time profiles are available .",
    "one has to be aware that superposed epoch analysis can mask small scale structures , in particular if they are not visible in all events , like magnetic foot and overshoot structures .",
    "these and other features can be smeared out due to different bow shock velocities with respect to the satellite for different crossings . this effect becomes worse the farther away from the keytime the data are averaged .",
    "nevertheless , superposed epoch analysis is useful to reveal the average plasma and magnetic field parameters and the typical features in the vicinity of the key - structure as has been shown by , e.g. , _ paschmann et al . _ [ 1993 ] , _ phan et al . _ [ 1994 ] , and _",
    "bauer et al . _ [ 1997 ] in there studies at the magnetopause .",
    "the time series adjusted in the way described above are superimposed by averaging 10-s bins .",
    "the averages are performed geometrically in order to reduce the dominance of cases with large dynamical ranges .",

    "the proton bulk velocity @xmath30 , shown in the next panel , decreases to somewhat less than half of its solar wind value for the quasi - perpendicular bow shock and to slightly more than half for the quasi - parallel bow shock .",
    "the third panel shows the proton velocity parallel to the shock normal vector .",
    "the latter is calculated from the fairfield bow shock model [ _ fairfield _ , 1971 ] . for both categories @xmath31 decreases by more than the magnitude of the proton velocity @xmath30 , indicating that the plasma is deflected away from the bow shock normal direction in order to flow around the magnetopause . in the last panel",

    "@xmath37 is the average of @xmath35 taken during one spin period . at the keytime , @xmath32 is approximately half the jump of the magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "further upstream and downstream it is a measure of wave activity with doppler - shifted periods shorter than the spin period of about 4.3 s. although the magnetic field increases only gradually at the quasi - parallel bow shock , @xmath32 is strongly enhanced at the bow shock crossing time and has a maximum immediately downstream of the shock .",
    "this jump in @xmath32 , as a parameter measured independently of the velocity , is a confirmation that the selection of the crossing times with the help of the velocity jump ( section 2 ) is reasonable . in the foreshock region upstream of the quasi - parallel bow shock ,",
    "@xmath32 is considerably higher than in the solar wind regime upstream of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock .",

    "the electron temperature @xmath40 is shown .",
    "downstream of the quasi - parallel bow shock crossing it has about the same value as downstream of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock .",
    "however , upstream of the quasi - parallel bow shock @xmath40 is about a factor of 1.6 higher than upstream of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock .",
    "the reason for this is again the foreshock region where the solar wind kinetic energy is already partly transformed into thermal energy .",
    "the last panel shows the proton temperature anisotropy @xmath41 .",
    "the plasma instrument did not resolve the cold , supersonic distributions of the solar wind ions .",
    "the calculated proton densities and temperatures are therefore not reliable in the solar wind regime .",
    "hence , the proton temperature anisotropy can not be determined in the upstream region and is therefore set to 1 . whereas the proton temperature anisotropy downstream of the quasi - parallel bow shock is insignificant , there is a strong proton temperature anisotropy , @xmath42 , downstream of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock , with a maximum value of more than 2 immediately behind the shock . comparing the downstream values of the electron and proton temperatures (",
    "not shown ) , we find @xmath43 for the quasi - parallel bow shock and @xmath44 for the quasi - perpendicular bow shock . whereas the electron temperature is slightly anisotropic , @xmath45 , upstream and downstream of quasi - perpendicular shocks , no significant anisotropy is observed at quasi - parallel shocks .      in order to analyze the low frequency magnetic fluctuations we perform a spectral analysis of the magnetic field using a cosine - bell filter",

    "this fact is investigated more carefully in section 4 .",
    "downstream of the quasi - parallel bow shock the spectral energy is again higher than downstream of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock .",
    "for @xmath54 it follows the power law @xmath55 .",
    "3min after the crossing the spectral energy is higher than in the 2 later spectra but already lower than directly at the bow shock .",
    "for both categories the spectral energy decreases steeply ( @xmath56 ) for @xmath57 .      the processes in the bow shock transition region itself can not be described in terms of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) . however , if one considers the bow shock as an infinitesimally thin discontinuity one can derive from the mhd equations the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions ( see , e.g. , _ siscoe _ , 1983 ) , which are relations for the conditions in the plasma upstream and downstream of the discontinuity under the assumption of time independence .    for mass continuity",
    "the jump condition is @xmath58 where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the upstream and downstream values of the corresponding parameters , respectively . according to eq .",
    "( [ con ] ) the product of the downstream - to - upstream ratio of the electron density @xmath59 and the normal proton velocity @xmath31 , which is equivalent to the plasma bulk speed normal to the discontinuity , must be unity . for the quasi - parallel events this product",
    "is observed to be about 0.6 .",
    "this fact is not surprising , since the considered upstream time profiles are not taken from the quiet solar wind regime but from the dynamic foreshock region , which is highly time dependent . for the quasi - perpendicular events this product is observed to be about 0.8 , which means that the jump condition eq .",
    "( [ con ] ) is not fully satisfied .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that we have not measured the exact electron density , but only the density of electrons with energies between 15 ev and 30 kev .",
    "electrons with higher energies are negligible since already in the energy range of 1.8 - 30 kev the upstream density is of the order of @xmath60 @xmath22 .",
    "however , particularly in the cold solar wind , electrons with energies below the instrument cut - off contribute an essential part to the total electron density . therefore we use the corrected electron density @xmath38 .",
    "the correction is calculated with the assumption of a maxwellian distribution of the measured temperature . however , as has been measured , e.g. , recently by the wind spacecraft [ fig .",
    "4 of _ lin _ , 1997 ] , the quiet solar wind flow can not be described by a single maxwellian distribution over its whole energy range .",
    "therefore the electron density could easily be overestimated by the correction , especially in the cold solar wind regime where the low energy electrons are more important than in the warmer magnetosheath regime . in order to satisfy the jump condition",
    "( [ con ] ) we can estimate , that the value of the corrected electron density upstream of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock is about 20% too high if we assume that the error in the downstream value is not of importance .",
    "other factors for the apparent deviation from mass continuity could be the unknown bow shock motion , which changes the downstream plasma velocity by a higher percentage than the upstream plasma velocity , and the uncertainty of the shock normal vector .    for an exactly parallel shock wave one derives from the rankine - hugoniot jump condition that the magnetic field remains constant in magnitude and direction and one is left with the equations for a purely hydrodynamic shock wave . in the case of an exactly perpendicular shock wave",
    "the jump conditions give the relation @xmath61    for the limit of high mach numbers , i.e. , the alfvn mach number @xmath62 and the sonic mach number @xmath63 , eq .",
    "( [ esenk ] ) has a value of 4 for @xmath64 .",
    "since we do not observe the extreme cases of exactly perpendicular and exactly parallel geometry but quasi - perpendicular and quasi - parallel shock wave crossings with finite mach numbers the numbers given above are not reached . for the quasi - perpendicular bow shock the ratio eq .",
    "( [ esenk ] ) is about 3 for the average magnetic field @xmath29 and proton normal velocity @xmath31 , and somewhat less for the corrected electron density @xmath38 according to the above mentioned probable overestimation of this parameter in the solar wind regime . for the quasi - parallel bow shock",
    "the change in the magnitude of the magnetic field is significantly lower than for the quasi - perpendicular bow shock , which is consistent with theory .    in their study of subcritical quasi - perpendicular shocks , _ thomsen et al .",
    "_ , [ 1985 ] found that the downstream electron temperature is nearly isotropic , @xmath65 , and that the downstream - to - upstream ratio @xmath66 of the perpendicular temperature is approximately equal to the ratio @xmath67 of the magnetic field strength . from the latter result they concluded that the net heating is adiabatic , although @xmath68 is not constant .",
    "obtaining averages , @xmath65 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , we can confirm these results for our data set of ( subcritical and supercritical ) quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "moreover , isotropy of the downstream electron temperature and adiabatic net heating is also found for our data set of quasi - parallel shocks , for which we obtain averages @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "an interesting question of shock physics is how the dissipated bulk flow energy of the solar wind is partitioned amongst ion and electron heating . for the average proton - to - electron temperature ratio we found @xmath74 downstream of the quasi - parallel bow shock and @xmath75 downstream of the quasi - perpendicular bow shock .",
    "hence , for quasi - parallel shocks proton heating is more favored with respect to electron heating than for quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "let us turn to the low frequency waves of fig .",

    "[ flucsp2 ] . at",
    "quasi - parallel bow shocks the wave power observed 3min upstream of the keytime is much higher than the power of the interplanetary alfvn waves observed upstream of quasi - perpendicular shocks .",

    "[ 1995 ] and _ russell & farris _ [ 1995 ] . the nonlinear steepening of the shock leads to whistler precursors phase standing in the shock frame .",
    "the interaction between ions reflected at the shock and the incoming solar wind can drive ion beam instabilities .",
    "these are probably the source of large - amplitude waves observed at periods around 30s . finally , there are upstream propagating whistlers with frequencies around 1hz , which seem to be generated directly at the shock . the most striking feature in the average spectrum of upstream waves observed 3min before the keytime is the kink at @xmath76 .",

    "there is a clear correlation found between these two ratios with a correlation coefficient of 0.8 .",

    "the value of the correlation coefficient 11 minutes downstream is not reliable since only a limited data set extends so far downstream . although the temperature anisotropy is highest immediately downstream of the bow shock , the best correlation is found around 5min downstream .",

    "since downstream of the quasi - perpendicular high-@xmath1 bow shock the mirror instability criterion is satisfied on average , we have looked more carefully for this highly compressive non - propagating mode .",
    "the fact that the compressive mode has a higher power spectral density downstream of the high-@xmath1 than downstream of the low-@xmath1 shock might indicate the existence of mirror modes .",

    "in addition , 2 high-@xmath1 events show ion cyclotron waves in the consecutive spectra taken 5 , 7 , and 9min downstream .",
