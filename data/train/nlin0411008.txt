    "since the fundamental work by kolmogorov in @xmath0 @xcite,@xcite one of the key points for many theoretical achievements in turbulence research is the ( statistical ) restoration of homogeneity and isotropy of fluctuations at small scales @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is however impossible to provide a proper and consistent description of a great variety of systems where `` non idealized '' fluctuations are still alive .",
    "the characterization of the emission of a tracer from point - like sources , the study of scalar concentrations along channels with non - homogeneous boundaries , or in those systems whose large scales are driven by strong shears , are remarkable examples in which strong anisotropies @xcite,@xcite and inhomogeneities @xcite must be taken into account in order to obtain a correct picture of the statistical properties of those systems .",
    "+ in the last decade a consistent progress in the development of a systematic analysis to separate isotropic fluctuations from the anisotropic ones in real turbulent flows and turbulent transport @xcite,@xcite,@xcite has been carried out .",
    "it has been understood how to treat and face systems whose rotational symmetries are broken by the presence of an external forcing inducing anisotropic contributions . in particular , the study of a simplified model for passive scalar advection , known as kraichnan model @xcite,@xcite , has provided a clear understanding of the statistical properties in all anisotropic sectors of the scalar fluctuations . indeed , closed equations for the equal - time correlation functions can be obtained : these are linear partial differential equations whose unforced solutions ( also called zero modes @xcite ) generally exhibit anomalous scaling .",
    "this is in contrast with the forced solutions that possess ( non - anomalous ) dimensional scaling .",
    "this has given the insight to explain the universality in the statistical framework .",
    "indeed , the anomalous properties of small scale statistics result from a decoupling between the zero mode scaling and dimensional scaling , and the universality of these properties naturally emerges because the zero - mode scaling properties are independent on the forcing mechanism ( see @xcite for an exhaustive review ) .",
    "+ in the present paper we formulate the concept of the possible small - scale homogeneity restoration by focusing on the two - point equal - time scalar correlation function for the kraichnan advection model .",
    "the advecting velocity is still homogeneous and isotropic but this is not for the scalar injection mechanism which is supposed here to be neither isotropic nor homogeneous .",
    "as we will show , the inhomogeneous forcing induces a new lengthscale @xmath1 into the scalar dynamics , in terms of which quantitative conclusions on the persistence of small - scale inhomogeneity will be given .",
    "the aim of this investigation is twofold .",
    "firstly , we want to show how the correct homogeneous limit can be restored going at separations ( in the two - point scalar correlation function ) smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , we want to give some analytical insights about the opposite physical situation represented by the presence of inhomogeneous fluctuations on scales of the same order of our separation . in the latter regime",
    "the pure power - law behaviour ( homogeneous limit ) is replaced by the `` beating '' in superposition of different power laws originating from the scalar inhomogeneities .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] we formulate the general problem of anisotropic and inhomogeneous correlations . this problem will be studied analytically for the kraichnan ensembles . in section  [ sec:3 ] the statistical description of the isotropic sector",
    "is provided with particular emphasis on some kinds of physically meaningful forcings .",
    "conclusions follow in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "let us start with the equation for a passive scalar field transported by the velocity field @xmath2 : @xmath3 the velocity field @xmath2 is assumed incompressible , statistically homogeneous and isotropic , whereas the source term @xmath4 is a large - scale random forcing which is not invariant under translations .",
    "let us now specialize to the case of the kraichnan ensemble @xcite,@xcite where the velocity field is gaussian , white in time , zero - mean and with two - point correlation function @xmath5 the spatial behaviour is described by @xmath6 with @xmath7\\ ] ] for @xmath8 smaller than the integral scale of the velocity field ( @xmath9 ) , above which @xmath10 saturates to an almost constant value whose order of magnitude is @xmath11 ; consequently , since the correlation @xmath12 has to vanish for @xmath13 , the relation @xmath14 holds .",
    "@xmath15 is the space dimension ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is the scaling exponent , describing the degree of roughness present in the velocity field , lying in the open interval @xmath18 .",

    "we have multiplied ( [ partenza ] ) by @xmath24 , averaged over the stochastic fields @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( exploiting furutsu - novikov s rule on integration by parts @xcite ) , symmetrized the resulting expression and eventually dropped the temporal derivative term .",

    "it measures the separation above which inhomogeneities become important ( e.g. it can be derived through a dimensional - analysis balance between the first and the third term in ( [ eq:1 ] ) ) and it is defined as @xmath50^{-1/(2-\\xi)}\\;.\\ ] ] the fourier scale @xmath51 of the forcing inhomogeneities can be larger or of the same order of @xmath43 . in the latter case we have @xmath52 and",

    "an important exception to the previous limitation on @xmath51 is provided , in way of example , by the emission of a tracer from a point source , in which all @xmath55 s are excited with the same strength .",
    "this case is however quite peculiar because @xmath43 would be infinitesimal and @xmath1 would fall in the diffusive range , thus preventing us from taking the limit @xmath28 . in what follows we will always consider @xmath28 and @xmath56 .",

    "we find a dependence on some unknown constants ( @xmath61,@xmath80 ) that can be fixed upon boundary conditions .",
    "to provide a clear and instructive example we can assume a forcing whose correlation function is a step function in @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath83 . in this case we can perform an exact matching in @xmath84 comparing the limits ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) of both @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( prime means derivative with respect to the variable @xmath37 ) deriving from the two expressions ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) ( see appendix ) .",

    "it is important to note ( see appendix ) that taking the limit @xmath91 for fixed @xmath43 and @xmath37 , ( [ eq:8 ] ) reduces to the well - known solution for the homogeneous case .",
    "indeed , the latter solution satisfies the equation : @xmath92 anyway , in a small scale description with respect to the forcing correlation ( @xmath82 ) , the presence of a finite @xmath1 can reduce the range of pure power - law behaviour because of the presence of the bessel functions in our solution .",
    "this scenario is clearly opposite to the one considered in the homogeneous limit where a pure power - law behaviour is found . + in order to get a deeper insight about these two different regimes , in the next section we concentrate ourselves on a purely isotropic situation where the forcing correlation function depends only on @xmath93 and the correlation of the scalar field coincides with its isotropic sector ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "we can repeat the same arguments given for the general case to obtain @xmath97 where @xmath98,@xmath99 are known functions of @xmath43 and @xmath1 ( see appendix ) . as discussed in the previous section , the presence of the bessel functions ( the fingerpoint of the scalar inhomogeneities ) makes it impossible to see a clear power - law behaviour in the inertial range when @xmath100 .",
    "this is clearly seen by calculating local - slopes ( figure 1 ) of the difference @xmath101 strictly related to the second - order structure function , where @xmath96 is the general solution ( [ eq:12 ] ) . for a fixed @xmath43 and @xmath17 ( say , @xmath102",
    ", corresponding to the koc51 scaling @xcite ) we can change the ratio @xmath103 and examine the local slope behaviours as a function of @xmath104 : the homogeneous case ( single power - law behaviour in the inertial range ) is recovered only when @xmath105 , while for @xmath1 of the same order of @xmath43 a coexistence of power laws spoils the pure scaling of the homogeneous case .",
