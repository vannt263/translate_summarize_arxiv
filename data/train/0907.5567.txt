    "radial velocity surveys of the milky way halo can now reveal rare velocity outliers resulting from dynamical processes throughout the galaxy .",
    "presently there are three known categories of velocity outliers among main sequence stars : ( 1 ) runaway stars originating in the galactic disk @xcite , ( 2 ) velocity outliers from tidal disruption of dwarf satellites within the halo @xcite , and ( 3 ) hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) originating in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "recent simulations predict the observable spatial and velocity distributions for hvss @xcite and for remnants of tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "although runaway stars have been known for a long time , there has been only limited investigation of their observable spatial / velocity distribution throughout the galaxy .    here",
    ", we simulate the production of runaways and trace their orbits through the galaxy , concentrating on runaways that reach the halo .",
    "we derive the spatial and velocity distributions of runaways as a function of mass and use these results to predict observable quantities for comparison with data from radial velocity surveys . from these results , we estimate the fraction of runaways in surveys of halo stars .",
    "we also evaluate the likelihood of runaway star contaminants in targeted surveys for hvss .",
    "first reported by @xcite , runaway stars are short - lived stars at unexpectedly large distances and velocities relative to their probable site of origin @xcite . in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "roughly 1030% of o stars and 510% of b stars are runaways @xcite .",
    "the main population of runaways has a velocity dispersion , 30 , roughly 3 times larger than the velocity dispersion of non - runaway stars in the galactic disk .",
    "however , several runaways have velocities @xmath0 100  relative to the local standard of rest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and large distances , @xmath0 500 pc , from the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the large velocity dispersion and vertical scale height suggests a dynamical process that ejects runaways from the thin disk into the halo .",
    "runaways probably originate within star - forming regions in the disk of the milky way .",
    "disruption of massive binaries is the likely source of runaways . in the binary supernova mechanism ,",
    "a main sequence runaway is ejected when its former companion star explodes as a supernova ; subsequent mass loss and the kick velocity from the asymmetric explosion are sufficient to unbind the binary ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario , the runaway moves away with roughly the sum of the kick velocity and the orbital velocity of the binary , a velocity physically limited by the orbital velocity at the surface of the stars . in the dynamical ejection mechanism ,",
    "runaways are ejected in dynamical three- or four - body interactions ; the outcome is any combination of single stars and binaries @xcite .",
    "the maximum ejection velocity from dynamical binary - binary encounters is formally the escape velocity of the most massive star @xcite .",
    "understanding whether the proposed formation mechanisms can produce the observed runaway star populations requires high quality kinematic data and a clear understanding of the dynamics of close binaries and dense star clusters . for large ensembles of runaways ,",
    "the low binary frequency of runaways favors the dynamical ejection mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , the predicted kick velocity of supernovae is uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; if it is large enough , runaways produced by the supernova ejection mechanism will also be single . for individual runaways",
    ", it is possible to identify a point of origin by measuring accurate distances , proper motions , and radial velocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , both runaway mechanisms occur in nature .    existing observational and theoretical results place few constraints on the spatial and velocity distribution of runaways throughout the milky way . because accurate proper motions are often crucial for identifying runaways , known runaways are observed largely in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
