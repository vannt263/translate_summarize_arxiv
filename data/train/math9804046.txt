    "stellar moves were first considered by alexander ( @xcite ) who proved that they can relate any two triangulations of a polyhedron .",
    "alexander s moves were refined to a finite set of local ( bistellar ) moves which still act transitively on the triangulations of manifolds , according to pachner ( @xcite ) .",
    "using pachner s result turaev and viro proved that certain state - sums associated to a triangulation yield topological invariants of 3-manifolds ( see @xcite ) . recall that a bistellar move ( in dimension @xmath1 ) excises @xmath3 and replaces it with @xmath4 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are complementary balls , subcomplexes in the boundary of the standard @xmath5-simplex .",
    "for a nice exposition of pachner s result and various extensions , see @xcite .",
    "the turaev - viro invariants carry less information than the reshetikhin - turaev invariants , which are defined using dehn surgery presentations instead of triangulations .",
    "in fact the latter have a strong 4-dimensional flavor , as explained by the theory of shadows developed by turaev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this motivates the study of state - sums based on cubulations , as an alternative way to get intrinsic invariants possibly containing more information ( e.g. the phase factor ) .",
    "cubical complex _ is a complex @xmath6 consisting of euclidean cubes , such that the intersection of two cubes is a finite union of cubes from @xmath6 , once a cube is in @xmath6 all its faces are still in @xmath6 , and no identifications of faces of the same cube are allowed .",
    "a _ cubulation _ of a manifold is specified by a cubical complex pl homeomorphic to the manifold . in order to apply the state - sum machinery to these decompositions we need an analogue of pachner s theorem .",
    "specifically , n.habegger asked ( see problem 5.13 from r.kirbys list ( @xcite ) ) the following :    suppose @xmath7 and @xmath8 are pl - homeomorphic cubulated @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "are they related by the following set of moves : excise @xmath3 and replace it by @xmath4 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are complementary balls ( union of @xmath1-cubes ) in the boundary of the standard @xmath5-cube ?    these moves will be called _ bubble _ moves in the sequel . among them , those for which @xmath3 or @xmath4 does not contain parallel ( when viewed in the @xmath9-cube ) faces are called _ np - bubble _ moves",
    ". there are @xmath9 distinct np - bubble moves @xmath10 , @xmath11 and their inverses , where the support @xmath3 of @xmath10 is the union of exactly @xmath12 cubes .",
    "for @xmath13 there is one bubble move which is not a np - bubble ( see picture 1 ) .",
    "set @xmath14 for the set of cubulations of a closed manifold @xmath7 , @xmath15 for the equivalence classes of cubulations mod np - bubble moves and @xmath16 for the equivalence classes of cubulations mod bubble moves .",
    "the answer to habegger s question , as it states , is negative because the triangle and the square are not bubble equivalent .",
    "in fact , for @xmath17 the move @xmath18 divides an edge into three edges and so @xmath19 .",
    "therefore a complete answer would rather consist of a description of @xmath16 .",
    "another way is to avoid the difficulties of a direct approach by looking for a sufficiently large class of cubulations having an intrinsic characterization and within which the cubulations are equivalent .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate some partial solutions along these lines .",
    "for instance , one associates to each cubulation @xmath20 of @xmath7 , a codimension one normal crossings immersion @xmath21 in @xmath7 . in this way",
    "one obtains a surjective map from the set of ( marked ) cubulations mod bubble moves to the bordism set of immersions .",
    "the latter has a homotopical description via the pontryagin - thom construction .",
    "we conjecture that this surjection is a bijection . on the other hand",
    "let us restrict to cubulations which can be combinatorially mapped into the standard cubulation of some euclidean space ( called mappable ) .",
    "one can approximate an ambient isotopy between two cubulations by some cubical sub - complexes of the standard cubulation .",
    "the path of cubical approximations is locally constant except for a finite number of critical values of the parameter , when a jump described by a bubble move occurs . as a consequence two mappable cubulations are bubble equivalent .",
    "we prove that the connected sum of cubulations mod bubble moves is well - defined , and this is compatible with the composition map for immersions .",
    "finally we consider the case of @xmath22 and show by a direct combinatorial proof that @xmath23 .",

    "we define a _ shuffling _ to be a sequence of moves where shellings ( i.e. adding iteratively cells , each intersecting the union of the previous ones along a ball ) alternate with inverse shellings",
    ". an equivalent statement of pachner s theorem is that all triangulations can be shuffled . in the case of cubulations",
    "the first obstruction for shuffling is that the cubulation bounds .",

    "cubical complexes , as objects of study from a topological point of view , were also considered by novikov ( @xcite , p.42 ) which asked whether a cubical complex of dimension @xmath1 embeds in ( or can be mapped to ) the @xmath1-skeleton of the standard cubic lattice of some dimension @xmath8 .",

    "the cubulation is _ standard _ if any two of its cubes are either disjoint or have exactly one common face .",
    "an immediate observation is that embeddable cubulations are standard and simple and mappable cubulations are simple . on the other hand",

    "one can realize the surgery on the piping tube , after pushing the local models thru it .",
    "a small isotopy moves them outside of a longitude and then the configurations embed in the ball obtained from the tube by cutting it along the longitude .",
    "it suffices therefore to show that the surgery can be realized by a cobordism in the ball which is a product on the boundary .",
    "for @xmath13 the different slices of the cobordism are given in the picture 4 .",
    "assume that the local models living in a ball have the corresponding hyperplane sections parallel to each other .",
    "let us consider two parallel hyperplane sections @xmath291 and @xmath293 of the respective local models @xmath412 and @xmath413 .",
    "then one constructs the neighborhood of @xmath416 around the piping tube by removing the interiors of @xmath291 and @xmath293 and gluing back the cylinder of boundary @xmath417 .",
    "this transformation can be realized also by a cobordism of immersions since it is represented by the local picture around a critical point of index 1 , where the images of the immersions are the non - critical levels before and respectively after passing through the critical value .",
    "the local picture can be made transversal with respect to the other coordinate hyperplanes of the immersions which were left untouched .",
    "one composes the cobordisms associated to all @xmath1 pairs of parallel hyperplane sections .",
    "the restrictions on the boundary of these cobordism are products and so we can glue the composition with the trivial cobordism outside the local pictures .",
    "thus we derived a cobordism between @xmath416 and @xmath418 .",
    "notice that , in general , the map @xmath419 should depend on the length of the tube @xmath166 .",
    "the case when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spheres could be different however .",
    "observe first that the set @xmath420 is infinite .",
    "in fact the number of components with odd self - intersections of the associated immersion is an invariant , because the only move creating new components is @xmath18 , and each new created component is an embedded circle .",
    "set @xmath421 for the sum over the various connected components @xmath79 of the number of self - intersections .",
    "the similarity with the reidemeister moves in the plane suggests that @xmath420 is the set of framed circles in the plane . unlike the case of reidemeister moves , the image of the immersion remains connected , so its components can not be separated using bubble moves . on the other hand",
    "the move @xmath136 can create / annihilate a pair of self - intersections .",
    "it is not clear that the singularities can always be paired such that suitable np - bubble moves destroy all pairs of singularities and so each transformed circle has @xmath422 singularities .",
    "if this is true it will remain to prove that all configurations of circles among which there are exactly @xmath172 singular circles are np - bubble equivalent .",
    "this would establish an isomorphism between @xmath420 and @xmath423 .",
    "we are able to prove this statement for the case @xmath424 ( and @xmath425 ) : [ section ]      call a disk bounded by two disjoint arcs a _",
    "biangle_. a biangle is _ tight _ if no other arc intersects its interior .",
    "observe that using np - bubble moves one can transform all minimal biangles into tight biangles .",
    "we use isotopies of the boundary of the biangle ( @xmath136-moves ) reducing the number of squares contained in the disk and @xmath371 moves .",
    "the possible configurations of tight biangles can be rather complicated , even if the cubulation is simple .",
    "let us show that the tight triangles can travel along the edges ( sliding ) .",
    "this means that a regular homotopy moving a tight biangle along the arcs can be realized by np - bubble moves .",
    "the proof of this claim is contained in the picture below .",
    "we marked in a little rectangle the area on which the bubble move acts :    set @xmath185 for the union of two transversal arcs .",
    "an arc which intersects three times one branch of @xmath185 and then the other arc can be simplified by a composition of bubble moves which we call a s move :    now it is easy to obtain that the set of semi - simple cubulations mod np - bubble moves is equal to the set of simple cubulations mod np - bubble moves .",
    "in fact any tight biangle coming from the same component can be transformed into tight biangles on different components :    assume that the cubulation is simple .",
    "the union of the circles @xmath79 for @xmath426 , divides the sphere into polygonal faces , each of them having at least two vertices .",
    "we claim that , either there are no biangles involving an arc from @xmath427 or else @xmath427 is a small circle contained in the union of two faces which intersects minimally ( i.e. twice ) the common edge . indeed , suppose that there exists a minimal tight biangle .",
    "consider the face which is adjacent to the biangle and not containing it .",
    "if @xmath427 does not satisfy the claim then we can simplify the biangle using slidings and s - moves , as it is shown below :    thus @xmath427 can be transformed into a circle which does not support any biangle .",
    "further use of the moves @xmath136 and @xmath371 allows us to isotope @xmath427 into the union of two faces as claimed .",
    "one continues the simplification procedure with the other components @xmath79 and the proposition 5.1 follows .    a similar proof works when the circle @xmath427 is allowed to have one self - crossing .",
    "now @xmath427 is transformed into a a figure eight contained in the union of two faces which intersects minimally their common edge and forms one biangle .      in order to prove that @xmath23 one has to get rid of those self - intersections which are not cancelling pairs",
    "the following figures describe the simplifications obtained with the additional move @xmath428 for two adjacent self - intersections :    further , if the two self - intersections are separated by additional arcs then use @xmath136-moves and slide across these arcs .",
    "it follows that any dual graph can be transformed using bubble moves into one satisfying @xmath429 , for each component @xmath79 .",
    "the next step is to show that two components `` can be added '' .",
    "let @xmath427 and @xmath430 be two components having non - void intersection .",
    "there exists an equivalent configuration in which @xmath427 and @xmath430 are replaced by the circle @xmath431 verifying @xmath432 , the other @xmath79 s ( @xmath433 ) are left unchanged and the additional components have @xmath434 .",
    "it suffices to do that in the case when @xmath435 .",
    "then the kinks can be added and transformed in consecutive self - intersections which have already been solved .",
    "thus , if one adds those components which are not embedded , we obtain a planar graph whose components are embedded , except possibly for one which has @xmath436 .",
    "we have therefore @xmath437 . if @xmath438 then the result of the previous section shows that all these configurations are np - bubble equivalent .",
    "if @xmath439 it means that @xmath20 is a figure eight in the plane . the remark after the proof of proposition 5.1 ends the proof of the theorem 1.3 .",
