    "after the first experimental report on the exotic baryon assigned as @xmath9 from the lesp collaboration at spring-8  @xcite , there have been a large number of related experimental and theoretical works to date . among them , the graal collaboration reported a new nucleon resonance @xmath1 from @xmath0 photoproduction  @xcite gev  @xcite . ] .",
    "their data show a narrow peak of which decay width @xmath10 was estimated to be about @xmath11 mev .",
    "after the fermi - motion correction being taken into account , the width may become even narrower @xmath12 mev  @xcite .",
    "this narrow width is a typical feature for the pentaquark exotic baryons  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the production process of the @xmath1 largely depends on its isospin state of the target nucleons : a larger @xmath1 peak is shown for the neutron target , while it is suppressed for the proton one .",
    "considering the fact that isospin - symmetry breaking is negligible at the strongly interacting vertex , this large asymmetry comes mainly from the photon coupling .",
    "interestingly , @xmath1 being assumed as a member of the baryon antidecuplet ( @xmath13 ) , this large isospin asymmetry was well explained in the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath14qsm )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it originates from the @xmath15-spin conservation in the photon coupling  @xcite .",
    "this assymetry was emphasized once again experimentally in ref .",
    "recently , the tohoku lns  @xcite and cb - elsa  @xcite reported @xmath0 photoproduction from the deuteron target , providing the same conclusion on that behavior . concerning the spin and parity ,",
    "their assignments are not yet determined unambiguously .",
    "although the @xmath0-maid has assumed @xmath16 as suggested by the @xmath14qsm  @xcite , in our previous work  @xcite , we have shown that @xmath17 was equally possible in comparison with the experimental data .    in the present work , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we would like to present a recent study on the @xmath0 photoproduction employing the effective lagrangian approach in the born approximation .",
    "we include six nucleon resonances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 in a fully relativistic manner .",
    "we ignore the contributions from @xmath18 and @xmath19 considered in ref .",
    "@xcite since their branching ratios to the @xmath20 channel are negligible .",
    "nucleon pole terms and vector - meson exchanges are also taken into account as backgrounds . in order to test the spin and parity of the new resonance",
    ", we investigate the different four cases , @xmath2 .",
    "we utilize the phenomenological form factors in terms of a gauge - invariant manner as done in ref .  @xcite . as a result",

    "the present study seems to prefer the nucleon resonance of @xmath23 , but the possibility of higher spin can not be completely excluded .    the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we provide our formalisms for @xmath0 photoproduction . differential cross sections and beam asymmetry being compared to the graal data",
    "are given in section iii and section iv , respectively , with discussions .",
    "final section is devoted for summary and conclusion .",

    "the diagrams represent nucleon - pole ( top ) and resonance ( middle ) contributions in @xmath29- ( left ) and @xmath30-channels ( right ) .",

    "the effective lagrangians for the yukawa vertices for the background contributions can be written as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath28 , @xmath0 and @xmath36 stand for the fields of photon , nucleon , @xmath0 meson and vector mesons ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , respectively .",

    "@xcite , we use the simplified form for the spin-3/2 propagator as given in eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) , since this form dominates the low energy region .",
    "similarly , as for the spin-5/2 propagator , we consider the dominant contribution only .",
    "considering the extended structure of the hadrons ( @xmath40 ) , we introduce a phenomenological form factor for the resonance and background contributions in a gauge - invariant manner  @xcite : @xmath49^m , \\label{formfactor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the kinematical channel as well as the mandelstem variables ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the power @xmath52 is chosen to be unity for the spin-1/2 and -3/2 cases , and two for the spin-5/2 ones .",

    "we parameterize the form factor @xmath54 as follows  @xcite : @xmath55 we note that the amplitudes for the vector - meson exchange and resonant contributions are gauge invariant .",
    "the cuf - off masses are determined such that the data are well produced : @xmath56",
    "in this section , we provide numerical results for total and differential cross sections and beam asymmetries .",
    "first , we show those for the total cross sections as functions of the photon energy in the laboratory frame in fig .  2 for the proton target ( first and second rows ) and neutron target ( third and fourth rows ) .",
    "the results are shown separately for each spin - parity combination and the sign of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "when we turn off the effects from the new resonance ( @xmath60 ) , the proton data are well reproduced .",
    "this tendency is well compatible with estimations from the @xmath14qsm  @xcite and consistent with our previous results  @xcite . on the contrary , as for the neutron target",
    ", we have varieties in the shapes of the curves due to the interferences between the new resonance and other contributions , depending on its spin , parity and @xmath61 .",
    "we observe that there is constructive interference for the cases of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , showing the peak due to the new resonance @xmath1 .",
    "note that the interference is mainly due to the new resonance and the spin-5/2 resonances , @xmath65 and @xmath6 .",
    "the absolute values of the photon coupling are found to be @xmath66 for the spin-1/2 cases and @xmath67 for the spin-3/2 ones , respectively , to provide clear peaks , indicating the evidence for the new resonance .    in figs .  3 and 4 , we draw the results for the differential cross sections as functions of @xmath68 , in which @xmath69 stands for the angle between the incident photon and outgoing kaon in the center of mass ( cm ) frame , at a fixed photon energy @xmath70 and @xmath71 mev , where experimental data are available . at @xmath72 mev , which is almost the same with the threshold value , we have rather flat curves dominated by @xmath29-wave contributions as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "especially , we can reproduce well the experimental data , taken from refs .",
    "@xcite , for the proton target case .",
    "the neutron results are also dominated by the @xmath29-wave ones and do not depend much on the spin and parity of the new resonance . as the photon energy increases , higher wave contributions start to come into play as shown in fig .  4 for @xmath73 mev .",
    "again , the proton data are well reproduced .",
    "however , we have rather different shapes for the neutron showing a bump structure in the backward scattering region @xmath74 .",
    "we verified that these bumps are due to the @xmath65 contribution .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath75 is not so obvious again for all the spin - parity cases .    in figs .  5 and 6",
    ", we show the differential cross sections with respect to the center of mass ( cm ) energy at fixed angle @xmath76 and @xmath77 degrees , respectively .",
    "the experimental data for the neutron and proton targets are taken from ref .",
    "our results for the proton target slightly deviate from the data at @xmath78 as shown in fig .  7",
    ", although the energy dependence beyond @xmath79 mec , as well as the total cross section at the entire energy region are reproduced well . in contrast , the neutron data are well reproduced for the cases of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 as in the cases for the total cross section results .",
    "it turns out that @xmath80 for the spin-1/2 cases and @xmath81 for the spin-3/2 ones are appropriate to reproduce the observed peak .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , as for the @xmath16 case , the estimated value of @xmath82 is consistent with the result of the @xmath14qsm  @xcite . focusing in the forward scattering region",
    "@xmath83 as shown in fig .  6 ,",
    "our results for the proton target are overestimated in comparison to the experimental data .",
    "interestingly , since the effects of @xmath65 and @xmath6 become stronger for the neutron target at this angle , the peak around @xmath84 mev becomes as high as that of @xmath85 .",
    "thus , it is not easy to find a clear evidence for the new resonance in the forward scattering region .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the beam asymmetry for the present reaction process , which is defined as follows : @xmath86\\times\\left[\\frac{d\\sigma } { d\\omega}_{\\parallel}+\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\omega}_{\\perp}\\right]^{-1}. \\label{eq : ba}\\ ] ] here the subscript @xmath87 denotes that the polarization vector of the incident photon is parallel to the reaction plane , and vice versa for @xmath88 . from this definition , electric dominance of the photon coupling ( @xmath89 ) gives @xmath90 whereas magnetic one ( @xmath91 ) does @xmath92 .",
    "we show our results in figs .  7 and 8 as functions of @xmath69 at a fixed photon energy @xmath93 and @xmath94 mev for the same @xmath75 .",
    "in the vicinity of the threshold ( @xmath95 mev ) , the proton data are well reproduced showing a positive bump at around @xmath96 which indicates that the electric photon coupling prevails .",
    "the bump structures are slightly shifted to the forward angle for the neutron target case , because of the effects from the spin-5/2 resonance contributions . however , from the beam asymmetry results , we can not see clear evidence for the new resonance . as the energy grows ( @xmath97 mev ) , the numerical results start to deviate from the experimental data for the proton as shown in fig .",
    "8 ; the theory is almost symmetric , while the experiment asymmetric and entitled to the forward scattering region .",
    "we consider that this deviation may result from unknown resonances , which are not taken into account here .",
    "interestingly , although the results for the neutron are all similar to each @xmath75 case , the beam asymmetry becomes negative , resulting from the strong interference between the new resonance and @xmath65 .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0-meson photoproduction in an effective lagrangian approach where the scattering amplitude was computed in the born approximation .",
    "following our previous work , we studied the role of the new nucleon resonance at round @xmath98 gev testing its possible spin and parity theoretically , considering @xmath99 as well as @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to this resonance , we considered six other nucleon resonances , i.e. ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , and nucleon - pole and vector - meson exchange contributions as backgrounds .",
    "all coupling strengths were determined by available experimental data and those obtained in the nijmegen potential .",
    "gauge invariance was satisfied explicitly via appropriate form factor schemes .",
    "total and differential cross sections were computed and compared with the experimental data . in generl",
    ", the data for the proton were well reproduced without the new resonance contribution , while for the neutron data with that for @xmath101 , @xmath63 and @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , it turned out that the interferences between the new resonance and the spin-5/2 resonant contributions ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) were crucial for the neutron target .",
    "we estimated @xmath105 for the spin-1/2 cases and @xmath106 for the spin-3/2 ones to reproduce the peak at @xmath107 mev .",
    "however , it was not easy to determine the spin and parity of the new resonance unambiguously within the present framework .    from these observations ,",
    "the new resonance can be considered as @xmath108 along with the estimated strengths of @xmath57 at best in the present work .",
    "this is the same conclusion as in our previous work , in which the spin-3/2 cases were not taken into account . among three possibilities of the spin and parity of @xmath1 , it is interesting to adopt @xmath109 , since our reaction study implies a photon coupling which is consistent with the prediction of the chiral quark - soliton model .",
    "the photon coupling that vanishes for the proton resonance is a general consequence of su(3 ) flavor symmetry when the resonance is identified as a member of the antidecuplet pentaquark baryons .",
    "experimentally , we still need further information in order to establish that the peak structure in the deuteron target is the real one from the new resonance .",
    "once it will be done , we will be able to make another step forward to exotic hadron spectroscopy .",
