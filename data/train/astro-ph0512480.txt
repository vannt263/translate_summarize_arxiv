    "through x - ray observations of nearby galaxies , a class of ultraluminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources has emerged .",
    "these are pointlike , non - nuclear sources with observed x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath3ergs@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "of most interest are those sources with bolometric luminosities in excess of the eddington limit for a 20 m@xmath4 black hole , or l@xmath5ergs@xmath1 .",
    "the true nature of these sources is unclear , and this class most likely includes several different types of objects . though some of these sources are located within a few parsecs of their host galaxy s dynamical center , they do not exhibit many of the characteristics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . because the ratio of x - ray to optical flux is a factor of 10 greater than that of agn @xcite , these objects are fairly easy to recognize in x - ray imaging data .    assuming that the eddington limit is obeyed by black hole accretion , the existence of such luminous non - agn sources presents a puzzle .",
    "several models have been proposed to account for the high luminosities of the ulxs . among",
    "these are relativistic and non - relativistic beaming from stellar - mass black hole systems @xcite and accretion of matter into intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) . in several ulx systems",
    "( ngc 1313 x-2 , m81 x-9 , etc . ) , detection of emission nebulae surrounding the ulx supports isotropic emission from the central source @xcite , which can not be described through beaming .",
    "further , a number of ulx ( ngc1313 x-1 , etc . )",
    "x - ray spectra are best fit with combined multi - component blackbody ( mcd ) and power law fits , similar to galactic black holes in their high - state .",
    "recently , @xcite find that many spectral fits of ulxs require cool accretion disk temperatures of approximately 100ev .",
    "the theoretical relationship between black hole mass and disk temperature ( t @xmath6 ) has been observed to hold true for stellar mass ( typically around 1kev ) and supermassive ( around 10 - 100ev ) black holes @xcite . using these scaling relations",
    ", the cool accretion disk ulxs would correspond to a population of high - state imbhs with masses of @xmath7m@xmath4 .    if ulxs do not obey the eddington limit",
    ", they could be the result of an outburst ( such as can occur in low mass x - ray binaries within our own galaxy ) .",
    "@xcite find evidence for approximately 5 galactic black hole x - ray binaries which exhibit luminosities in the ulx range during outbursts .",
    "these sources would appear as transient ulxs .",
    "the typical time scale for outburst of galactic x - ray transients is a few days to rise from quiescent level with a decline from peak brightness to quiescent value of 30 - 40 days @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation is super - eddington emission from accretion disks surrounding stellar mass black holes @xcite .",
    "sources of this type would be expected to have soft x - ray components well modeled by hot accretion disks ( @xmath8kev ) similar to superluminal x - ray sources in the galaxy ( e.g. belloni et al . 1997 ) .",
    "likely , ulxs include a variety of different objects with both isotropic and non - isotropic emitters .",
    "however , if some ulxs do indeed represent a class of high - state imbhs , similar to the high / soft ( thermal dominated ) state stellar mass black holes in our galaxy , we might also expect to see the low - state objects from this same population . in galactic black hole systems ,",
    "the low - state is generally characterized by lower luminosity , with l@xmath9l@xmath10 @xcite , and a power law photon spectrum , typically with index @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the existence of some ulx sources ( ic 342 x-1 , ngc 5204 x-1 ) as possible low - hard ( pure power law ) state imbhs , well - fit by simple absorbed power laws , have been noted from chandra observations by @xcite . in this study",
    "we seek to test a direct prediction of the imbh hypothesis ; namely , whether there is a class of sources with properties consistent with what we expect of low - state imbhs .",
    "this requires two major assumptions : ( 1 ) that the emission from ulxs is isotropic and ( 2 ) that imbhs exhibit the same states ( whose classification was based on luminosity and spectral form ) as stellar mass black holes .",
    "our goal is to find these `` low - state '' sources , if they exist , classify the properties of both high - state and low - state ulxs , and test whether these data are consistent or inconsistent with the predictions of the imbh hypothesis .",
    "we present the results of a detailed analysis of ulxs in nearby galaxies observed with the european space agency s _ xmm - newton _ observatory . only _ xmm - newton _ provides the count rates and bandpass necessary to distinguish different spectral models for most ulxs , accurately determine both the temperature of the thermal component expected for high - state objects , and determine whether this component is required in the spectral modeling of these objects .",
    "since the xmm - newton x - ray spectra of ulxs are similar in quality to spectra for galactic x - ray binaries obtained in the 1980s , our spectral classification in this paper will remain purely schematic .",
    "thus , our classifications as low and high state objects are a first approximation , based on the quality of the spectra available .    in section 2 ,",
    "we detail the observations examined from the _ xmm - newton _ archives and explain the data analysis for the individual point sources . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the spectral fitting technique as well as simulations we conducted to determine their validity .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section 4 .",
    "the data used in this investigation were drawn from the _ xmm - newton _ public data archive . assuming that low - state ulxs exist in the luminosity range of @xmath12ergs@xmath1 , we conducted simulations to determine the optimum criteria for observations capable of resolving point sources of this luminosity .",
    "our simulations provided a guide for choosing which of the vast number of archival xmm datasets we should examine .",
    "this luminosity range was chosen on the assumption that an approximately 100m@xmath4 black hole would radiate at @xmath13 of the l@xmath10 in the low - state @xcite .    within the luminosity range of interest ( l@xmath0ergs@xmath1 ) ,",
    "there are a number of known objects that could be confused with ulx sources .",
    "one type of source is supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "these sources are often easy to distinguish based on their characteristic spectrum : with poor signal to noise we expect a steep power law and as the signal to noise increases , emission lines become clearly visible .",
    "super - eddington accreting neutron stars have been observed to have luminosities within this range for a short period of time .",
    "neutron star x - ray binaries often have spectra well fit by a hot multi - color disk blackbody model , or with low signal to noise , by a bremsstrahlung model .",
    "both models have similar curvature and a 0.7 - 2.0kev blackbody model is indistinguishable from the bremsstrahlung model .",
    "we chose to use the bremsstrahlung model because it is the simpler model and gives an adequate qualitative description to the data .",
    "we expect that for low temperature bremsstrahlung sources , the spectrum should be easily distinguishable from a power law with @xmath14 ( as is expected for a low - state object ) .",
    "if , however , the neutron star spectrum has kt @xmath15kev , as observed for some ns x - ray binaries , our simulations show that we can not distinguish between the power law and bremsstrahlung models .",
    "the most common sources we expected to find in this luminosity range were the analogs to galactic black hole x - ray binaries in their high - soft ( thermal dominated ) state .",
    "these sources typically have spectra well fit by a blackbody with temperature of @xmath16kev combined with a power law with index @xmath17 .",
    "our simulations sought to determine the number of photons required to distinguish between spectral fits corresponding to a power law model with @xmath14 and a combined blackbody and power law model .",
    "these models qualitatively correspond to those of a low - state ( pure power law spectrum ) and high - state ( thermal dominated spectrum ) x - ray binary .",
    "since we do not know the proper normalization between the blackbody and power law components for high - state objects ( it varies from source to source ) , we tested whether each of the components separately , e.g. blackbody or a steep power law , could be distinguished from the simulated `` low - state '' spectrum .",
    "we chose to simulate spectra in _ xspec _ using the command _",
    "fakeit none_. we used generic response and ancillary response matrices . simulating a power law model with a @xmath18 , we found that for 200 , 400 , and 1000 counts , these models were distinguishable at @xmath19% confidence from a blackbody source ( with kt constrained to the range of 0.6 to 1.3kev , similar to that of galactic black holes ) .",
    "we found that for a lower number of counts the distribution in @xmath2 values increases to include a larger range of @xmath2 values ( i.e. @xmath2 = 1.3 - 2.0 compared to @xmath2 = 1.5 - 1.7 ) . simulating a power law with @xmath20",
    ", we find the same trend .",
    "we determined that at roughly 400 counts the distributions of @xmath2 from a @xmath18 and @xmath20 power law become entirely separable at @xmath19% confidence .    in order to distinguish between the different spectral fits for objects with l@xmath21ergs@xmath1 , we select all galaxies that were observed for at least 10 ks ( with the exception of the bright ulx in ngc 5408 , which had enough photons for analysis despite the low exposure time ) with _ xmm - newton _ and that are closer than 8 mpc .",
    "we estimated that these criteria would give us a minimum of 400 counts for objects with l@xmath22ergs@xmath1 .",
    "we emphasize that the criteria quoted , based on the simulations , were used as a guide in choosing the sample of galaxies examined in this study .",
    "these simulations are not used as the statistical basis for our object - by - object analysis ( discussed in section 3 ) .",
    "our sample of galaxies is selective in that it represents objects of interest in the x - ray band .",
    "we include details on these host galaxies in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ spectral information of individual x - ray sources had previously been published for approximately 60% of the host galaxies .",
    "we include references in the alternate i d column and footnotes of table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we do not compare our results with these previous studies on a source by source basis .",
    "we found that abstracts describing the proposals for _ xmm - newton _ observations were available for only 13 of the 32 galaxies examined .",
    "of these 13 , only one observation cited the motive as a study of ulxs ( ngc 1313 ) .",
    "however , 7 of the remaining 19 galaxies contained sources classified as ixos , intermediate x - ray objects , by @xcite .",
    "if the remaining galaxies were not studied due to their ulx population , the effects of bias are small with roughly 25% of the sources studied explicitly due to their connection with ulx sources .",
    "our host galaxies include only spirals and irregulars .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] displays the distribution of galaxy type .",
    "we reduced the data using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) version 6.0.0 . since the processed pipeline products ( pps )",
    "were created with earlier versions of sas , the observation data files ( odf ) were used to produce calibrated photon event files for the epic - mos and pn cameras using the commands _ emchain _ and _ epchain_. following this , the events tables were filtered using the standard criteria outlined in the _ xmm abc guide_. for the mos data ( both mos1 and mos2 cameras ) , good events constitute those with a pulse height in the range of 0.2 to 12 kev and event patterns that are characterized as 0 - 12 ( single , double , triple , and quadruple pixel events ) . for the pn camera ,",
    "only patterns of 0 - 4 ( single and double pixel events ) are kept , with the energy range for the pulse height set between 0.2 and 15 kev .",
    "bad pixels and events too close to the edges of the ccd chips were rejected using the stringent selection expression `` flag = = 0 '' .",
    "time filtering was applied as needed by editing the light curve produced in _",
    "xmmselect _ for the entire observation .",
    "flare events ( distinguished by their high count rate ) detected in all three cameras , were cut using the _ tabgtigen _ task as outlined in the _",
    "abc guide_. typical count rate parameters for filtering were rate @xmath23 for mos detectors and rate @xmath24 for the pn detector .",
    "such filtering was only done as needed .",
    "pre - filtered exposure times are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the number of counts from the filtered net exposure times for the individual sources are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we note that the filtered data are not always sufficiently clean that a high signal - to - noise is maintained up to 10kev .",
    "sources with a high background flux level , relative to the source spectrum , show poorer signal - to - noise in the spectrum above 1kev .    before extracting spectra of the brightest sources , contour maps of the x - ray observation",
    "were overlaid on digital sky survey ( dss ) images .",
    "this ensured that bright foreground stars and background agn were easily distinguished , and thereby not included in our sample .",
    "also , we checked the _ xmm - newton _ source positions with ned and simbad to determine if they coincide with any known background galaxies or qsos . a list of these bright fore - ground or background sources is included in table  [ tbl-7 ] .",
    "spectra for the bright point sources were extracted based on their apparent brightness in the ccd images .",
    "no explicit source detection algorithm was necessary .",
    "we used the sas task _",
    "especget_. with this task we created spectra ( for both the source and background ) , response matrices , and ancillary response files for all three epic cameras , when possible .",
    "the typical extraction radius was 20 arcseconds , but depending on both the size and proximity of a source to another source , the extraction radius ranged from 9 - 87 arcseconds .",
    "background spectra were extracted either in an annulus centered on the source , or in a circle of appropriate size away from the source , depending on the proximity of the candidate source to other x - ray sources .",
    "annuli were used for sources that were not located within a few arcseconds of another source , thus annular background extraction radii were not used for sources with small extraction radii . for sources in crowded regions , we used circular extraction radii close to the source .",
    "we extracted backgrounds close to the source in order to correct for emission local to the ulx . once the spectra were obtained , they were rebinned to require at least 20 counts per bin , using the command _ grppha _ in lheasoft .",
    "the list of sources , with position and count information , is included in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we only included sources for our spectral studies that had 400 or greater pn counts ( or mos for sources in ngc 253 and m81 and ngc 4945 xmm3 and ngc 2403 xmm1 , for which pn spectra were not available ) ..    the extracted spectra were fit with standard models in xspec v11.3.1 .",
    "for each source , we fit the pn and mos spectra simultaneously in the 0.3 - 10 kev range .",
    "we allowed a free normalization constant to account for the differences in flux calibration between the three cameras ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "each source was first fit with an absorbed single component model . in all cases",
    "we used the standard absorption model _",
    "wabs _ , leaving the column density as a free parameter . for those sources where the hydrogen column density was unconstrained , we fixed the value to the galactic foreground value listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "results of the single - component fits are seen in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we include in this table only the best - fit parameters for those sources best described by a single - component model .",
    "the addition of a blackbody component to these single - component fits changes the @xmath25 value by a negligible amount and therefore is not statistically significant .",
    "more specifically , the addition of a blackbody model to the power law fit corresponds to a @xmath26 , which is the @xmath27% confidence level using the f - test for two degrees of freedom .",
    "the flux values quoted represent the unabsorbed flux in the pn spectra , in the 0.3 - 10 kev band .",
    "all errors quoted , here and subsequently , correspond to the 90% confidence level for one degree of freedom ( @xmath28 ) . the luminosities were calculated from the unabsorbed flux using the distances quoted in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "both flux and luminosity correspond to those of the best fit model ( power law or bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "it should be noted that since our selection criteria was based on a count rate cutoff , due to the variety of spectral forms , the inferred luminosity cutoff will not be uniform .    in table",
    "[ tbl-3 ] we denote the single component model we choose as the better fit in bold .",
    "this notation also indicates the model ( power law or bremsstrahlung ) used to compute the quoted flux . for @xmath29% of the power law sources ,",
    "the @xmath25 difference ( @xmath30 ) between the power law and bremsstrahlung models is only marginally different . of these sources ,",
    "the average kt value for the bremsstrahlung fit is 5.54kev . from our simulations",
    "we find that at high temperatures the bremsstrahlung fit becomes indistinguishable from a simple power law .",
    "thus , given the high temperatures of the bremsstrahlung fits for these sources , they are equally well described by the power law model .",
    "typical kt bremsstrahlung values for accreting neutron stars are from 3.0 to 7.0kev @xcite .      from these single - component sources ,",
    "we classify 16 sources as low - state ulx sources .",
    "this classification is based on ( 1 ) the shape of the spectrum , well - fit by an absorbed power law , ( 2 ) the luminosity of the sources ( they needed to be luminous enough to be included in our sample , l@xmath0ergs@xmath1 ) , and ( 3 ) the x - ray location of the object within the optical galaxy ( based on digital sky survey ( dss ) images ) .",
    "the third criterion was important in limiting the effects of contamination from fore - ground and background sources within our sample of ulx sources .",
    "thus , we overlaid x - ray contours from the xmm image on the dss images , determining the location of the x - ray source as within or outside of the optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "we note that for two of the sources classified as low - state ulxs ( holmberg i xmm2 and ngc 2403 xmm4 ) , there is uncertainty of whether the x - ray source is in fact within the optical galaxy due to the quality of the optical dss images .",
    "the images used to determine the third criterion are available online ( http://www.astro.umd.edu/$\\sim$lwinter/second3.html ) .",
    "we further discuss these criteria in section 4 .",
    "we state that the first criterion for classification as a low / hard state ulx is a spectrum well - fit by a power law .",
    "of the 30 sources in table 2 , three sources were clearly not well - fit by either the power law or bremsstrahlung model .",
    "seven of the remaining 27 sources were clearly not within the optical extent of the host galaxy .",
    "of the remaining sources excluded from classification as a low - hard state object ic 2574 xmm1 was better fit with a bremsstrahlung model ( with @xmath31 ) .",
    "in an additional observation of the source ngc 4258 xmm2 , a simple power law model is not an adequate fit to the data ( while the luminosity of the source is not within the  ulx \" classification range mentioned in the introduction ) . for the remaining sources ,",
    "ngc 247 xmm2 and ngc 253 xmm2 , there was sufficient doubt on the spectral form where the bremsstrahlung and power law model as well as the addition of a thermal component all yielded adequate fits to the spectra .",
    "therefore , we excluded these sources from a classification , noting the ambiguity of the model fits for these sources .    for those sources we classify as ulxs , we include computed bolometric luminosities in table  [ tbl-11 ] .",
    "to compute the bolometric luminosities for these ulx sources , we used the exponentially cutoff power law spectrum of @xcite , model _ cutoffpl _ in _ xspec _ , with a cutoff energy of 10kev . from observational studies of galactic x - ray binaries , it has been observed that low - state objects have spectra that cut - off at high energies ( @xmath32kev ) @xcite .",
    "thus we chose the exponential model _",
    "cutoffpl _ over a simple power law .",
    "this also minimizes the total luminosity for flat power law sources .",
    "we computed an unabsorbed bolometric flux in the @xmath33kev range through use of the _ dummyresp _ command ( which extends the model beyond the observation s energy range ) .",
    "the luminosity was then computed using the distances listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we quote these values as l@xmath34 ( the luminosity obtained from extrapolating the power law portion of the spectrum as an exponentially cut - off power law ) in table  [ tbl-11 ] .",
    "we note that these values represent an upper limit on the bolometric luminosity for steep power law ( @xmath35 ) objects , since we would expect the power law component to cutoff at some low energy .",
    "however , for shallow spectrum ( @xmath36 ) sources l@xmath34 is a lower limit .",
    "this is because , schematically , a steep power law diverges at low energies while a shallow power law diverges at high energies .      for a number of sources",
    ", we found that an improvement in reduced @xmath25 was achieved through fitting their spectra with an absorbed two - component blackbody and power law model .",
    "we chose a simple blackbody model over the multi - component disk model , _ diskbb _",
    ", for purely schematic reasons .",
    "namely , observations of galactic x - ray binary systems were fit with blackbody models in the 1980s , when the signal - to - noise of these objects was comparable to that for our _ xmm _ data for ulx sources .",
    "we also note that the _ diskbb _ model does not give an entirely accurate physical description of the data as it neglects the effects of general relativity . as a schematic model , the blackbody model is simpler than _ diskbb _ , with the same number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , for low temperatures both models yield virtually identical temperatures . for this study",
    ", we chose the simpler model .",
    "we defer to a further paper a discussion of the different models for the thermal component .    in table",
    "[ tbl-4 ] we present the results for the sources which are fit significantly better by the two - component model , these are sources where the improvement in @xmath25 is greater than 8 ( determined from our simulations in appendix a ) .",
    "we include in table  [ tbl-4 ] the improvement in @xmath25 of the two - component fit over the simple power law .",
    "we include the power law best fits to these sources in the appendix for comparison with other analyses . in order to determine whether the blackbody component is statistically significant for the sources fit with a two - component model",
    ", we simulated spectra based on accurate modeling of some of the brightest sources : ngc 247 xmm1 , ngc 5408 xmm1 , and holmberg ii xmm1 .",
    "these sources span the observed range of the ratios of the blackbody to power law component and thus represent those from our sample with a weak blackbody relative to the power law component , intermediate case , and a strong blackbody , respectively .",
    "our simulations are described in full in appendix a. we found that , using a @xmath37 criterion , which corresponds to the 99% significance level as according to the f - test for the addition of two extra parameters , we can readily detect the strong and intermediate thermal components in all spectra with more than 400 counts .",
    "the weak thermal emission can not be detected in 400 count spectra , but is readily detected in 2000 count spectra .",
    "this gives us confidence that our results are statistically meaningful .",
    "of the sources in table  [ tbl-4 ] , we classified high - state ( or thermal dominated ) ulx sources based on three criteria : ( 1 ) spectra characterized by an absorbed power law and blackbody model , ( 2 ) luminosity , and ( 3 ) x - ray source within the optical extent of the host galaxy .",
    "the luminosity criteria required that these sources have unabsorbed luminosities l@xmath38ergs@xmath1 ( we used l@xmath39ergs@xmath1 as our hard cutoff ) .",
    "if the sources are radiating at the eddington luminosity , this cutoff luminosity corresponds to objects with masses greater than 20m@xmath4 .    from table  [ tbl-4 ] ,",
    "27 observations are recorded with l@xmath40ergs@xmath1 .",
    "the addition of a thermal component to these sources is statistically significant over a pure power law model .",
    "of the 27 observations , 3 correspond to multiple observations of a single source . from an analysis of the dss images ,",
    "all 24 of these sources are within the optical extent of their host galaxies .",
    "however , m51 xmm5 appears to be coincident with the center of its host , a dwarf companion galaxy to m51 .",
    "the location , coupled with the high luminosity ( l@xmath41ergs@xmath1 ) leads us to classify this source as an agn .",
    "we also excluded two sources ( ngc 1313 xmm2 and m81 xmm2 ) from our sample of high / soft state ulxs due to their previous identification as supernovae .",
    "of the remaining 21 sources , ngc 253 xmm4 had a luminosity of @xmath42ergs@xmath1 in one observation and @xmath43ergs@xmath1 in a second .",
    "this significant change in luminosity , with one observation below our luminosity cutoff and another a factor of @xmath44 higher than the other , led us to exclude this source as a high / soft state ulx .",
    "it is likely that this source is a stellar mass x - ray binary within its host galaxy , where one of the observations captured the source in an outburst .    in table",
    "[ tbl-13 ] , we list sources that have @xmath45 values less than 8 for a single observation .",
    "most of these sources have weak blackbody normalizations compared to the power law normalization .",
    "we classify these sources as being well - fit by a two - component model while acknowledging the uncertainty in the fit as determined by the simulations .",
    "the addition of the thermal component is not significant enough for these sources to be classified with certainty in either table 2 or 3 .",
    "the simple power law fits for these sources are included with those for sources in table  [ tbl-4 ] in the appendix .",
    "we note that due to their high luminosity we included six of these sources ( ngc 4490 xmm2 , ngc 4490 xmm3 , ngc 4736 xmm1 , m51 xmm2 , m51 xmm6 , and m101 xmm3 ) with uncertain fit parameters as ulx high - state sources .",
    "two of these sources ( ngc 4490 xmm3 and m51",
    "xmm6 ) had unabsorbed luminosities @xmath46 times the @xmath47ergs@xmath1 cutoff used for high - state ulx classification .",
    "the other four sources had luminosities above the threshold , as well as weak blackbody components compared to the power law ( see the appendix for simulations ) .",
    "we used these points to justify including these sources with the table  [ tbl-4 ] sources in the following discussions with the proviso that their spectral fits do not indicate absolutely the necessity of the additional thermal component .",
    "for this reason , we denote these sources with a special symbol ( a circle ) in subsequent figures while including them as `` high - state '' ulx objects .    for our ulx sources modeled by a combined blackbody and exponentially cutoff power law",
    ", we computed bolometric luminosities using two methods .",
    "the first method is recorded as l@xmath34 in table  [ tbl-11 ] .",
    "we computed the flux from 0.1 - 100kev using an unabsorbed blackbody and exponentially cutoff power law model using the xspec command _",
    "dummyresp_. for the second method , recorded as l@xmath48 in table  [ tbl-11 ] , we estimate a more accurate bolometric luminosity calculated from the flux in the range of @xmath49kt-100kev where kt is the blackbody temperature obtained from the model . in galactic x - ray binary systems ,",
    "the power law component of the x - ray spectrum is believed to be from comptonization in a corona .",
    "the photons supplying this energy originate from the blackbody continuum emanating from the accretion disk .",
    "thus , a natural cutoff for this power law component occurs at the peak emission of the blackbody ( which is approximately @xmath50kt ) .",
    "the estimated values ( obtained from cutting off the combined unabsorbed blackbody and cutoff power law model at the value @xmath49kt ) differ with regard to the full estimate ( flux from the fully integrated blackbody added to the separate flux from the cutoff power law from @xmath50kt to 100kev ) depending on the normalization factors used ( for both the blackbody temperature and the spectral index @xmath2 ) . choosing three sources displaying a range of blackbody to power law strength ( holmberg ii xmm1 , ngc 253 xmm1 , and ic 0342 xmm3 ) we found that the estimated values were within 88.3 , 95.1 , and 96.8% of the more complete estimation .",
    "given their close proximity ( within approximately 90% ) we quote these estimated values as a good approxmiation to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we note that our bolometric luminosities for all of the classified ulx sources , on average , are a factor of 1.08 greater than the x - ray luminosities in the @xmath51kev band for the objects best fit by a combined blackbody and power law .",
    "thus , to good approximation , the x - ray luminosity is the bolometric luminosity .",
    "however , for the objects best fit by a simple power law ( low - state ulx sources ) , the average bolometric luminosity is roughly a factor of 7 greater than the x - ray luminosity in our band .",
    "this average is dominated by the steep power law objects , in particular holmberg ii xmm1 ( @xmath52 ) . excluding this object , we get an average bolometric luminosity that is 2.8 times the x - ray flux and more indicative of the general properties of these power law - fit objects .      in addition",
    ", in this large sample of point sources , we came across a number of objects whose spectra were not well fit by the models we employed .",
    "these sources have luminosities exceeding l@xmath53ergs@xmath1 , if they are associated with the host galaxy , and are placed in tables 2 and 3 as well as appendix b. these sources include two supersoft sources , one possible agn , and three sources well fit with additional absorption models ( including a partial covering model and a model of hot gas ) .",
    "we briefly describe these sources in the appendix .",
    "we have determined best - fit spectral parameters of the bright x - ray sources in 32 nearby galaxies . in choosing three `` standard '' models for our study",
    ", we hoped to accurately separate high and low state ulxs from other types of luminous x - ray sources .",
    "we specifically chose to fit the data with the bremsstrahlung model in order to identify neutron star x - ray binaries within our sample .",
    "the models we used are purely schematic , and they do not physically explain the phenomena occurring , but are standard and qualitatively simple models often used to fit the spectra of galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "we cross - referenced the x - ray positions of our sources with both ned and simbad in order to identify known supernovae , galaxies , and stars . in addition , we examined the dss optical images to place the position of our sources within their respective galaxies .",
    "such analysis aimed to minimize contamination of our sample of ulxs with bright background and foreground sources .",
    "further , we examined _ xmm - newton s _ optical monitor data in the visual bands ( u , b , v ) .",
    "the _ xmm _",
    "pps contain point source detection files for the om data .",
    "we overlaid these point source detections with x - ray contour maps in order to determine the * brightest possible * optical count rates for the x - ray sources , which were then converted into fluxes using the om calibration documentation . in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , we plot the distribution of the logarithm of the x - ray to optical flux for the brightest possible optical counterpart inside the _ xmm - newton _ error circle",
    ". only 13 of the 32 host galaxies had visible band om data during the observations .",
    "of these 13 galaxies , 40 of the x - ray sources were in the range of the om data and only 14 were coincident with an optical point source .",
    "therefore , the majority of our sources have x - ray / optical flux ratios that are * larger * than those displayed .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] illustrates the lowest possible x - ray / optical flux ratios and also , by the sparsity of sources included in the diagram , it illustrates the fact that a majority of the sources have no obvious optical counterpart and thus have very large x - ray / optical flux ratios .",
    "we estimate the point source detection limit of the om u filter as approximately @xmath54erg@xmath55s@xmath1 . for an unabsorbed x - ray flux of @xmath56erg@xmath55s@xmath1 , typical of objects with l@xmath57ergs@xmath1 located at a distance of 8mpc ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the average value for our sources should fall around 2 or greater . the average distribution for qsos and agn centers around 0 and 0.8 for bl lacs @xcite .",
    "our objects have ratios of l@xmath59l@xmath60 at least 10 times higher than those of agn and 100 times greater than stars .",
    "recently , @xcite identify six ulxs from the catalog of @xcite as qsos .",
    "they hypothesize that a large number of ulxs may in fact be quasars at higher redshift than their supposed host galaxy .",
    "however , unlike the objects studied in @xcite , our ulx sources are all spatially coincident with the optical host galaxy .",
    "in addition , a majority of our ulxs are not in the proximity of a noticeable optical point source",
    ". the x - ray / optical flux ratios of our sources are much larger , on average , than might be expected for a qso .",
    "it is also worth noting that while some cataloged ulxs may be qsos , optical identifications have been made associating other ulxs with a type b supergiant companion @xcite .",
    "the spectral fits indicate that to high statistical probability ( see appendix a ) we can distinguish a class of low - state ulxs from the high - state objects .",
    "this is assuming , as indicated in the introduction , that ulxs are isotropic emitters with luminosity and spectral form similar to galactic stellar - mass x - ray binaries . in section 3 , we stated that our ulx classification depends upon three criteria : ( 1 ) spectral form , ( 2 ) luminosity , and ( 3 ) location of the x - ray source within the optical host galaxy ( as determined from the dss images ) .",
    "we have chosen simple , parametric ` non - physical ' models for the spectra because the signal to noise of most of the observations does not allow anything else to be constrained .",
    "of the sources in table  [ tbl-3 ] , 16 are classified as `` low - state '' objects or low / hard state ulxs , having unabsorbed luminosities @xmath61ergs@xmath1 and spectra that are well fit by power law models . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the term low - state ulxs to include `` low - state imbh candidates '' ( sources with l@xmath62ergs@xmath1 and spectra well - fit by a simple absorbed power law ) and low - state sources with luminosities that clearly classify them as ulx sources ( l@xmath63ergs@xmath1 ) .",
    "these low - state ulx sources are listed in table  [ tbl-11 ] .    in the spectral fitting section",
    ", we noted that a power law and high temperature bremsstrahlung model are indistinguishable .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider the luminosity of these sources in the claim that they are not neutron star x - ray binaries accreting at the eddington luminosity . of the low - state ulx sources ,",
    "only two of the 16 sources have bolometric luminosities below the eddington luminosity of a 3m@xmath4 object ( @xmath64ergs@xmath1 ) , corresponding to the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    "all of the sources have values exceeding the eddington limit for a 2m@xmath4 neutron star .",
    "further , 26 sources have unabsorbed l@xmath38ergs@xmath1 , corresponding to l @xmath65 l@xmath10 at m @xmath66 m@xmath4 as expected for `` high - state '' imbhs , and spectra that are well fit by combined blackbody and power law models . these are `` high - state '' objects .",
    "the spectral fits for these sources are listed in tables 3 and 4 . in a statistical sense , we find that the greater the number of counts in the observation the greater our confidence in the thermal component contributing to a better fitting model",
    ". we explain our confidence levels obtained from spectral simulations in the appendix .",
    "in addition to these high and low state ulxs , we find a large number of sources best fit by a combined blackbody and power law model but below our threshold of l@xmath67ergs@xmath1 for a high - state ulx ( listed in table 3 ) .",
    "many of these sources may be accreting stellar mass black holes with m@xmath24m@xmath4 .",
    "some of these non-``ulx '' sources were found away from the optical extent of the targeted galaxy ( from our analysis of the dss images ) , and therefore may be background agn .      for galactic black hole x - ray binaries , spectral indices of low - state ( or power law dominated ) objects",
    "are typically lower than those of high - state objects , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the distribution of the spectral index for both high - state and low - state objects .",
    "the spectral index for the high - state objects is the value of @xmath2 from the two - component fit . as in the galactic sources , it is clear that the spectral indices of the high - state objects are indeed larger . of further interest",
    ", the distribution of spectral index for low - state objects looks remarkably similar to the distribution of spectral index for moderate luminosity quasars , many of which are thought to be the analogs of low - state black holes @xcite .",
    "this supports the classification of these objects as accreting black holes .    for the high - state objects ,",
    "we find mean values of @xmath70 , with a root mean square ( rms ) deviation of s@xmath71 , and l@xmath72ergs@xmath1 , @xmath73 .",
    "this calculation excludes the 3 objects with spectral indices greater than 3.5 . for the low - state objects ,",
    "we find mean values of @xmath74 , with a rms deviation of s@xmath75 , and l@xmath76ergs@xmath1 , @xmath77 .",
    "this value of @xmath78 is softer than the typical hard - state value of @xmath79 , but within the @xmath80 range used to classify this state for galactic x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "computing a kolmogorov - smirnov two - sample test , separating the sources into the category of low - state or high - state , we find a likelihood of approximately 0.03 that the spectral indices belong to the same distribution .",
    "the low hard x - ray state of x - ray binaries is associated with a low accretion rate from the companion object with l@xmath81l@xmath10 @xcite . therefore , on average , we expect the luminosities of the low - state objects to be lower than the high - state objects .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays the luminosity of the objects as a function of the spectral index . on average ,",
    "the highest luminosity low - state objects have luminosities lower than those of the high - state objects .",
    "the lower l@xmath82 values of the low - state objects imply that they may indeed be accreting at a lower rate than the high - state objects .",
    "this can further be seen in the bolometric luminosities listed in table  [ tbl-11 ] .",
    "if these objects are accreting at a rate similar to galactic low / hard state black holes ( @xmath83 ) @xcite , we can estimate their masses as @xmath84 with @xmath85 as the eddington luminosity for a 1m@xmath4 object ( @xmath86ergs@xmath1 ) .",
    "our mass estimations , based upon our limits to the bolometric luminosities , yield masses of @xmath87 ( see table  [ tbl-11 ] ) , precisely what we might expect for a population of imbhs .      if the high - state ( thermal dominated ) ulxs represent a class of intermediate mass black hole systems , their x - ray spectra should be well described by a combined blackbody and power law model . scaling for the mass of the black hole",
    ", we would expect a relationship of t@xmath88m@xmath89 between black hole mass and blackbody temperature @xcite .",
    "this would indicate a thermal component of @xmath90 100ev for masses of @xmath91m@xmath4 .",
    "a few objects have been reported to display this property @xcite . in figure  [ fig4 ] , we graph the distribution of the thermal component for our classified high - state objects .",
    "we find that there are two peaks in the distribution among the thermal component , one at approximately 100 ev and another centered close to 1 kev .",
    "this could indicate two different classes among the high - state objects .",
    "it is possible that those objects with blackbody components near 100ev are indeed high - state intermediate mass black holes .",
    "we note that the soft excess in pg quasars has also been modeled as a blackbody with kt@xmath92ev , but it has been suggested that this could be the result of a process not directly related to black hole accretion ( such as the presence of a warm absorber : @xcite ) .",
    "another possible explanation is that the soft component is the result of ionized reflection from the disk @xcite . while the possibility exists that the `` thermal '' component of these 100ev sources is not directly related to black hole accretion or is related in a `` non - thermal '' ( i.e. ionized reflection ) sense , as may be the case with the soft excess in pg quasars , we assume that the soft component for the objects we classify as high - state ulxs originates from a thermal disk .",
    "we use this assumption to test the imbh hypothesis , thus speculation on the nature of the soft component is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the second peak , centered around 1 kev , has a temperature reminiscent of the galactic black hole systems in our own galaxy .",
    "these systems may thus be stellar - mass black holes accreting matter near the eddington limit .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect the luminosities of the sources exhibiting a higher blackbody temperature to be lower than those with cooler blackbody components . in the second graph of figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we plot the relationship between blackbody temperature and l@xmath93 in the 0.3 - 10 kev band .",
    "once again , two groups are seen in the distribution of high - state ulxs .",
    "the most luminous objects are those with low blackbody temperatures . on average ,",
    "the less luminous sources exhibit higher blackbody temperatures .",
    "for the sources with l@xmath94ergs@xmath1 , the mean blackbody temperature is 0.31 while the sources below this luminosity threshold have a mean blackbody temperature of 0.61 .",
    "the second , low - luminosity , group in the distribution of high - state ulxs is clearly distinguishable in both plots of figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we found that , with the exceptions of ngc 253 xmm1 , m81 xmm1 , and ngc 5204 xmm1 , the spectra of these objects could also be well - described by an absorbed comptonization ( _ compst _ ) model @xcite used to fit galactic black holes in the `` very high '' state when they are radiating at the eddington limit .",
    "this model simulates compton scattering of cool photons on the hot electrons of a completely ionized plasma .",
    "we present the best - fit parameters for the comptonization model in table  [ tbl-9 ] .",
    "this `` very high '' state has been observed @xcite in a few galactic black holes .",
    "yet another rubric for the very high state emerged in @xcite and @xcite , where they identify this as the `` anomalous '' state , a state whose spectrum can be well fit by a comptonized scattering model .",
    "regardless of the name , our best - fit comptonization sources likely fit into this category .",
    "the luminosities of these sources suggest that they are stellar mass black hole systems in this anomalous / very high state .    as with the low - state ,",
    "we include mass estimates for our high - state objects in table  [ tbl-11 ] .",
    "we assume that the high - state objects are radiating at l@xmath10 resulting in a minimum mass if there is no beaming .",
    "we find masses of @xmath95m@xmath4 , consistent with `` normal '' stellar mass bhs , for the sources well fit by the comptonization model .",
    "the other high - state ulxs masses range from @xmath96m@xmath4 based on eddington rates , analogous to the low - state ulx masses computed .",
    "it is important to note that the initial simulations ( appendix ) and discussions in the spectral simulations section need to be considered in relation to the impact they pose to our classification scheme and the results presented in these sections .",
    "while it is indeed possible that some of the objects with a weak blackbody component and a relatively small number of counts would be mis - categorized as a pure power law spectrum , one can ask what such a possible situation would do to the correlations that we have seen .",
    "these putative objects , by assumption would have lower luminosities , however their temperatures are unknown and it is entirely unclear if they would destroy the kt / l(x ) correlation . as we have shown in our simulations it is unlikely that the fitted power law index would change and thus the presence of a low state as indicated by the spectral index would not change .",
    "this would create a new type of object , one with a flat power law and a black body component , which is not seen in the milky way , nor among the high signal to noise objects .",
    "in addition to the existence of ulxs with low blackbody temperatures , the temperature distribution of the high - state ( thermal dominated ) ulxs ( figure  [ fig4 ] , left panel ) displays a `` gap '' which is of particular interest  there is a complete absence of objects with temperatures in the range 0.26kev to 0.50kev .",
    "it is tempting to take this as evidence for a gap in the mass distribution of these accreting black holes .",
    "since , for a given luminosity , we expect the temperature to vary as @xmath97 , this factor of two gap in the temperature distribution translates into a factor of four gap in the black hole mass distribution .",
    "if this result is borne out by further study , it provides an important clue to the origin and evolution of intermediate mass black holes .",
    "one popular idea is that intermediate mass black holes formed from the collapse of massive population iii stars @xcite .",
    "models suggest that pop iii stars with zero age main sequence ( zams ) masses in the range 25140@xmath98 and above 260@xmath98 collapse to produce black holes @xcite whereas in the range of zams masses 140260@xmath98 , pair - instability supernovae lead to the complete disruption of the stars ( i.e. , no remnant black hole remains ) .",
    "hence , this model for imbh formation predicts a gap in the imbh initial mass function in the range of approximately 60200@xmath98 ( although this is uncertain on the low end due to the effect of the pulsational pair - instability on the pre - collapse core ) .",
    "one possibility is that the gap in our observed temperature distribution ( and hence the inferred gap in the mass function ) is due to this effect of the pair instability supernovae in pop iii stars .",
    "this would require that the current imbh mass function is approximately the same as the initial imbh mass function .",
    "in other words , it requires that most imbhs ( especially those just below the gap ) have not grown significantly due to accretion since their formation and , hence , that the ulx phase represents a short fraction of the life - time of an imbh ( @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the e - folding timescale for eddington limited black hole growth with radiative efficiency @xmath101 ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the inferred mass gap is to suppose that two fundamentally different modes of formation lead to a strong bi - modality in the final black hole mass function .",
    "black hole masses below the gap can be readily understood through normal stellar processes .",
    "a separate and distinct population of significantly more massive black holes may result from dynamical processes in the core of dense globular clusters @xcite .",
    "supposing that the galaxy s bright x - ray population is representative of low - redshift galaxies , we expected to find a number of sources similar to galactic x - ray binaries in our sample . in our sample",
    ", we find approximately 24 sources with luminosities below our high - state ulx cutoff ( @xmath102ergs@xmath1 ) , x - ray positions within the optical extent of their host galaxy , and no obvious optical counterpart .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosities for these sources range from @xmath103ergs@xmath1 ( @xmath51kev band ) .",
    "two of these sources were transients in the _ xmm _ data .",
    "of the four host galaxies with multiple observations examined , two of these galaxies contained solely ulx sources in our luminosity regime ( holmberg ii and ngc 5204 ) .",
    "each of the remaining two ( ngc 253 and ngc 4258 ) had a transient source best fit by a combined blackbody and a power law .",
    "this suggests an interesting diagnostic in terms of distinguishing our ulx sources from a normal hmxb population . in our own galaxy ,",
    "most hmxbs vary on timescales of days or less and most of the black holes in the milky way are transients , though some hmxbs are indeed persistent . the figures in @xcite , determined through detailed mass - transfer calculations , indicate that transient behavior should not be expected from a population of imbhs .",
    "thus , on average , our ulx sources should remain x - ray bright in multiple observations . through a literature search , we found that 37/42 of our ulx sources are well detected in rosat observations and thus are luminous for greater than 10 years and therefore are not transients .",
    "examination of the long term light curves show that most of these sources vary by less than a factor of 3 over the timescale from rosat to xmm .",
    "the sources that have been above the eddington limit in the milky way and the magellenic clouds do so transiently , for a small fraction of the time .",
    "as best as we can tell , from the light curves from einstein , rosat , asca , chandra and xmm the ulxs are , rarely , transients , and are almost always ` on ' , unlike galactic `` ultra - luminous '' objects .    as a possible further diagnostic , we constructed a color - color diagram for our ulx sources .",
    "we adopted the colors of @xcite in order to compare our sample with their sample of galactic x - ray sources .",
    "thus , our colors were constructed from unabsorbed model fluxes in four energy bands : 3 - 4 , 4 - 6.4 , 6.4 - 9.7 , and 9.7 - 16 kev .",
    "the _ xspec _ command _ dummyresp _ was used to calculate a flux based on the model for the 10 - 16 kev range .",
    "we plot colors for a pure unabsorbed power law ( from @xmath104 ) and an unabsorbed mcd model ( _ diskbb _ in _ xspec _ with kt@xmath105ev ) for comparison . comparing our figure  [ fig5 ] with figure 8 of @xcite",
    ", we find that our ulx sources largely lie along the same regions as their black hole sources .",
    "a few ulx sources , however , lie in the region occupied by atoll and z - sources in the plot of @xcite .",
    "these sources were those best fit by a comptonization model .      in this section ,",
    "we examine the environment in which ulx sources reside .",
    "we investigate the claim that the ulx population is proportional to the host galaxy s star formation rate ( sfr ) ( ranalli et al .",
    "2002 ; grimm et al .",
    "2003 ) . towards this end",
    ", we use the far - infrared luminosity of the host galaxy as an indicator of the sfr . in order to compare the ulx population of a galaxy with the sfr we followed a similar approach to @xcite .",
    "we calculate the fir flux from observations taken by the _ infrared astronomical satellite_. as in @xcite , the flux between 42.4 and 122.5 @xmath106 m is approximated as 1.26@xmath107s@xmath108s@xmath109erg@xmath55s@xmath1 .",
    "the values of the flux at 60@xmath106 m ( s@xmath110 ) and 100@xmath106 m ( s@xmath111 ) were obtained from either @xcite or ned .",
    "luminosities were calculated using the distances quoted in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we list these values in addition to the number of ulxs observed in individual galaxies in table  [ tbl-10 ] .",
    "the number of ulxs includes both the objects we classify as high and low state ulx as well as those sources resolved by chandra .    in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    ", we show two plots relating the number of ulxs to l@xmath112 .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that the luminosity function in the x - ray regime from hmxbs is related to sfr . in our first plot",
    ", we find that the galaxies with the highest l@xmath112 seem to have fewer ulxs than may be expected from the luminosity functions of @xcite , who present a relationship showing a scaling of the number of hmxbs with luminosities over a set threshold with the host galaxy s sfr ( see equation 7 ; grimm et al .",
    "2002 ) . using this relationship",
    ", we would expect that a galaxy with a sfr approximately equal to that of m51 ( @xmath113m@xmath4yr@xmath1 from their table 1 ) to have @xmath114 objects with luminosities greater than @xmath3ergs@xmath1 .",
    "we find 5 objects with this luminosity in m51 , consistent with their result .",
    "however , for ngc 4945 , a galaxy with approximately the same l@xmath112 and therefore sfr , we find only one source with a luminosity in this range .",
    "however , we note that ngc 4945 is a seyfert , implying that the l@xmath112 may primarily be caused by the agn and not a direct indication of sfr .",
    "in addition to high l@xmath112 sources with few ulx we find a number of sources with very small sfr but which contain a ulx . for sources with sfr @xmath115m@xmath4yr@xmath1 , which corresponds roughly to sources with l@xmath112 less than that of ngc 4736 , we would expect @xmath116 sources with luminosities above @xmath3ergs@xmath1 . however , there are a number of bright ulxs in galaxies with very low sfrs ( for instance holmberg ii , holmberg ix , ngc 5204 , and ngc 5408 ) .",
    "thus , in a direct comparison , our results do not agree with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "the second plot displays the average number of ulxs / galaxy , binned according to luminosity .",
    "this plot is extremely similar to fig .",
    "15 of @xcite for spiral galaxies .",
    "thus , once again , it seems that the connection between sfr and the ulx population in spirals is supported . for irregular galaxies",
    ", however , there seems to be more of a spread in the distribution .",
    "this could be the result of poor sampling  most of the bins contain only one galaxy .",
    "another possibility is that there is no direct correlation in irregular galaxies or that the overall star formation in these galaxies is less ordered or clumpier .",
    "if the latter is the case , the overall sfr of the galaxy is only an average over a wide range of values .",
    "we shall address this issue again in the next paper in this series ( l.m .",
    "winter et al . , submitted ) where we discuss the local environments of the ulxs in our sample .    in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we plot the distribution of column densities among the ulxs .",
    "we subtracted the galactic column density towards the galaxy ( obtained from the nh ftool and listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] ) from the values obtained through spectral fits .",
    "we note that , on average , the ulxs have large column densities .",
    "the typical galactic column density along a line of sight is @xmath117@xmath55 .",
    "if the ulx is located on the opposite side of its host galaxy , we might expect maximum column densities of @xmath118@xmath55 .",
    "however , most of our sources have column densities well above this value .",
    "this is in agreement with the analysis of 5 ulxs by @xcite and may imply , as they suggest , that the local environment of the ulxs contains an extra source of absorption .",
    "we are investigating this further , comparing the x - ray absorption column densities with hi data ( l.m .",
    "winter et al . , submitted ) .    in order to better understand the relationship between sfr and the ulx population , it is necessary to extend ulx studies to other wavelengths . in particular , it becomes important to analyze uv and ir images close to the ulx .",
    "we present the results of an _ xmm _ survey of the ulx population in nearby galaxies . in this study",
    ", we assumed that ulxs are isotropic emitters .",
    "for our selected ulx sources ( which excluded transient sources and supernovae ) , this assumption was supported by the finding that 37/42 of our ulxs were found to be ` on ' in rosat observations .",
    "this implies that theses sources exhibited high luminosities for time scales of at least 10years , a property that is not seen in galactic eddington - limit exceeding sources ( such as black hole x - ray binaries undergoing an outburst ) .",
    "we also assumed that if some ulx sources represent a class of imbh x - ray binaries , they would exhibit spectral states analogous to galactic stellar mass black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "this is the hypothesis we set out to test , classifying a source as a ulx based on ( 1 ) spectral form , ( 2 ) luminosity , and ( 3 ) coincidence of the x - ray source within the optical host galaxy . due to the quality of spectra available for these distant x - ray sources ,",
    "our classification of spectral form is really a first approximation describing the basic curvature of the spectrum .    through this study",
    ", we have found that there exists a population of objects whose x - ray spectral properties closely match the low / hard state spectra of galactic black holes , but whose luminosities lie in the range of l@xmath119ergs@xmath1 . in the milky way , black holes with these spectral properties",
    "radiate at only @xmath120 of the eddington limit .",
    "if this is also true for this population , it indirectly implies that these objects have a mass greater than @xmath121m@xmath4 ranging up to 1500m@xmath4 and thus should be imbhs .",
    "the existence of such objects was `` predicted '' on the basis that the ulxs previously studied shared the x - ray spectral characteristics of high - state galactic black holes ; namely , an x - ray spectrum best fit by a combined blackbody and a power law @xcite , but with much higher luminosities .",
    "if these objects are high - state imbhs , the corresponding low - state objects should also exist .",
    "our survey has also uncovered a large population of objects whose x - ray spectra are well modeled by the canonical description of galactic black holes in the high - state ( thermal dominated ) , a black hole with a steep power law , but whose bolometric luminosities exceed @xmath122ergs@xmath1 , ranging up to @xmath123ergs@xmath1 and whose blackbody temperatures are less than 0.3kev . if these objects are radiating at @xmath124 the eddington limit like their milky way counterparts their implied masses are from @xmath125m@xmath4 , a range very similar to that implied by the low - state objects . using the m@xmath89 scaling of mass to temperature ,",
    "the observed spectral temperatures give masses of @xmath126m@xmath4 a considerably larger value .",
    "in general agreement with the expectations of the imbh hypothesis , the objects with high - state spectra are more luminous than those with low - state spectra .",
    "we note that these results have required the high signal to noise of _ xmm _ in order to discern the spectrum of these objects .",
    "many of these objects have also been observed by chandra and their spectra have been well - fitted by simple power laws .",
    "in addition to classification of the sources , we investigated some of the properties of the ulx sources .",
    "we found a gap in the temperature distribution of high / soft state ulxs .",
    "this gap may indicate a gap in mass distribution , which may provide clues to the nature of ulxs .",
    "we also found that our ulxs are persistent sources ( not transients ) which occupy regions on the color - color diagram of @xcite also occupied by galactic black hole sources .",
    "lastly , the existence of a substantial population of ulxs in nearby dwarf and other low star formation rate galaxies argues that ( in agreement with @xcite ) there is more than one source term for the origin of ulxs , with at least some of them not being associated with recent star formation , at least statistically .",
    "we conclude , from an x - ray spectral and luminosity point of view , that our data are consistent with many of these objects having the properties expected of an imbh population .",
    "however , we also find two other populations of objects , those whose blackbody temperature and luminosity correspond to that of stellar mass black holes with kt @xmath127kev and @xmath128 less than @xmath122ergs@xmath1 and a small population of objects whose x - ray spectra and luminosities are consistent with that of stellar mass black holes in the very high state .",
    "thus , ulx selected purely on the basis of @xmath51kev x - ray luminosities are a composite class with @xmath129 being `` normal '' stellar mass black holes and the rest being consistent with a population of imbhs .    in a follow - up paper",
    "we will discuss the environments of these objects as revealed by _ xmm _",
    "om uv imaging and the implications this has for the origin of ulxs .",
    "l.w . gratefully acknowledges kip kuntz and m. coleman miller for helpful discussions .",
    "we would also like to acknowledge r. narayan for asking the question `` are there any low - state ulxs ? '' at the kyoto black hole meeting .",

    "when the upper limit was instituted at 2.0 or 3.0 , we found that all 500 simulated spectra were fit with a @xmath476 or 3.0 , respectively , for the simple power law model .",
    "this same affect is not seen in the @xmath2 of the two - component model , where the value ranges between 1.4 and 4.0 with a peak in the distribution near that of the original model used to simulate the spectra .",
    "thus , higher power law indices ( @xmath477 ) can indicate the necessity of an added blackbody component .",
    "since there are no galactic black holes whose broad band spectra are well fit by steep power laws it seems that restricting the allowed power law indices is more consistent with the nature of galactic black holes . in fitting our sources with the three `` standard '' models",
    ", we allowed the @xmath2 to float , thus the problem of a missing blackbody component being compensated for by a steep power law should not have factored into our classification criteria .",
    "our next set of simulations sought to determine our confidence in the simple power law fit being an adequate descriptor of the spectra .",
    "binning provides a problem in distinguishing between a powerlaw and a curvature in the spectrum at the low energy range , since the binning procedure can wash out a low kt blackbody from the spectrum . for this reason",
    ", we chose to simulate unbinned pn spectra for a source we categorized as a low - state object , ic 0342 xmm1 .",
    "ic 0342 xmm1 represents characteristics typical of our low - state candidates , namely it is within the proper luminosity range and it has a power law index of @xmath14 ( the median of the distribution for low - state objects is 2.03 ) and a hydrogen column density near the median of all the fitted values ( where the median value is @xmath478@xmath55 and the value of ic 0342 x-1 s column density is @xmath479@xmath55 ) .",
    "we chose this source for these reasons and the high number of counts in its pn spectrum .",
    "instead of using the @xmath25 statistic ( used for binned data ) , we chose to use the maximum - likelihood statistic , _ c - stat _ , in _ xspec _ ( which uses unbinned data ) .",
    "we simulated 500 spectra using the best - fit parameters for the simple power law fit using the _ fakeit _ command .",
    "we fit the simulated spectra with two models : the simple powerlaw and a combined blackbody and power law model and computed the change in the goodness of fit , @xmath470 .",
    "for the two - component model , once again we placed the constraint that the blackbody temperature remain in the range that it would be detectable by _ xmm - newton _",
    ", 0.07 - 4kev .",
    "we followed this procedure for 1000 , 2000 , and 4000 counts . at both the 1000 and 2000 count level ,",
    "the addition of a second component has no effect on the c - statistic ( the distributions in c - space for both the power law fit and the two - component fit are indistinguishable ) .    at the 4000 count level , the c - statistic distributions for the two models separate such that there is an 26% confidence that the two - component model is a better fit to the data .",
    "we find , when we examine the model parameters , that the power law index ( @xmath2 ) for the two - component model ranges between @xmath480 with the mean value @xmath481 .",
    "the mean value for all three count levels used clustered around this value , though the range in @xmath2 increased as the counts decreased .",
    "the mean blackbody temperature for simulations with 4000 counts was 1.17kev ( with the range varying between the amount previously noted ) with a median of 1.06kev . for simulations with lower counts",
    ", the blackbody temperature becomes higher ( 1.24kev for 1000 counts ) with a higher median ( 1.83kev for 1000 counts ) .",
    "this tells us that the fitting procedure tends to approximate a pure power law spectrum as a two - component spectrum with @xmath2 equal to that of the true spectral index but with a blackbody temperature higher than those observed in our study ( 1.1kev or higher ) which in the _ xmm _ band can be approximated as a power law .",
    "if we found spectra in our sample that were best fit with a low spectral index and a high blackbody temperature , we might suspect that the spectrum s true nature is a power law .",
    "we also note that if the hydrogen column density is large , much @xmath482@xmath55 , a low temperature ( kt ) blackbody component can be much more difficult to detect .",
    "the following sources were not best fit by the standard models employed in this study :      this source was classified as a super - soft x - ray source by @xcite .",
    "we find that the standard single - component absorbed blackbody model is a much better model for this spectrum .",
    "in fact , the power law , bremsstrahlung , and combined models do not fit the data within the 90% confidence range .",
    "fitting an absorbed blackbody , we find the best fit corresponds to the following parameters : @xmath483@xmath55 , @xmath484kev , and @xmath485 .",

    "this indicates the prescence of hot gas , indicating a possible thermal x - ray source .",
    "the spectrum of this source was not adequately fit with any of the standard models used in this investigation .",
    "the spectrum exhibits a prominent fe k line in the pn spectrum that is well fit by a gaussian ( _ zgauss _ ) at 6.4 kev .",

    "the source is clearly located within the optical galaxy , and is thus unlikely to be a background agn .",
    "the spectrum and luminosity ( l@xmath496ergs@xmath1 ) of this source suggests that it is an agn .",
    "the location of the source , from the digital sky survey , places it within the dwarf companion of m51 making a value of the optical flux hard to constrain .",

    "<S> we attempt to determine if there is a low - state counterpart to the ultraluminous x - ray ( ulx ) population , searching for a soft - hard state dichotomy similar to that known for galactic x - ray binaries and testing the specific predictions of the imbh hypothesis . to this end , we searched for  low - state \" objects , which we defined as objects within our sample which had a spectrum well fit by a simple absorbed power law , and  </S>",
    "<S> high - state \" objects , which we defined as objects better fit by a combined blackbody and a power law . assuming that `` low - state '' objects accrete at approximately 10% of the eddington luminosity @xcite and that  high - state \" objects accrete near the eddington luminosity we further divided our sample of sources into low and high state ulx sources . </S>",
    "<S> we classify 16 sources as low - state ulxs and 26 objects as high - state ulxs . as in galactic black hole systems , the spectral indices , @xmath2 , of the low - state objects , as well as the luminosities , </S>",
    "<S> tend to be lower than those of the high - state objects . </S>",
    "<S> the observed range of blackbody temperatures for the high state is 0.1 - 1kev , with the most luminous systems tending toward the lowest temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore divide our high - state ulxs into candidate imbhs ( with blackbody temperatures of approximately 0.1kev ) and candidate stellar mass bhs ( with blackbody temperatures of approximately 1.0kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> a subset of the candidate stellar mass bhs have spectra that are well - fit by a comptonization model , a property similar of galactic bhs radiating in the  very - high \" state near the eddington limit . </S>"
