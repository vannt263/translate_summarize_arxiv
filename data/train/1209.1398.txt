    "the advent of precision control and measurement of interacting ultracold atomic systems has provided a productive testing ground for few - body physics .",
    "predictions from condensed matter and nuclear physics made in the 1960 s and 1970 s , like fermionization of strongly - interacting bosons and universality in efimovian states , have been verified using ultracold atoms as a kind of quantum simulator .",
    "the signatures of few body physics can also be seen in the statistical and dynamical properties of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "further , deterministic loading of a few cold atoms into deep optical lattices has made feasible the prospect of spectroscopic measurements of highly - correlated atomic states .",
    "this last application in particular has generated a lot of interest in analytical results and theoretical methods for a few particles that are trapped in an approximately harmonic well and interacting via short - range potentials  @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review and a more complete bibliography , including experimental progress .",
    "one motivation for this line of research is , like untrapped few - body systems , trapped systems offer the possibility for observing universal properties  @xcite , i.e.  few - body observables whose value is independent of the short - range interaction details or particle structure  @xcite .    for harmonic traps ,",
    "exact results exist for two bodies in the limit of a zero - range , contact interaction  @xcite , sometimes called the scaling limit . for three harmonically - trapped particles ,",
    "there are analytic solutions in the joint case of the scaling limit combined with the unitary ( or resonance ) limit  @xcite , i.e  strong interactions , usually described by a large two - body scattering length .",
    "however , except for the unitary limit , solving for the energies and eigenstates of few - body quantum systems requires approximations .",
    "this article describes a method to analyze the case of three equal - mass particles in one - dimension interacting via a zero - range contact interaction .",
    "we will calculate the variation of the energy spectrum as a function of interaction strength as it varies between the repulsive unitary limit to the attractive unitary limit .",
    "we will combine techniques that have have been previously employed with a geometrical approach to implementing the discrete symmetries of the hamiltonian and any superselection rules due to indistinguishable particles . in particular , we find that representations of the symmetry groups @xmath1 and @xmath2 allow us to present a unified classification scheme for the atom , dimer and trimer states with different three - particle content , including two and three identical bosons or fermions , as well as no identical particles .",
    "this is a generalizable method that maximizes separability and reducibility in trapped few - body systems and therefore enhances computational efficiency .",
    "our method is most similar in spirit to the techniques of @xcite , who use discrete symmetries to classify three - particle states in two dimensions , and @xcite , who use discrete symmetries to reduce the problem of two - particles in an anisotropic well .",
    "approximations are particularly useful when they exploit symmetries to map the few - body system in a controlled way onto a related mathematical structure that has more separability and reducibility .",
    "the standard example of separability is found in the transformation from the particle coordinates to the center - of - mass / relative coordinates , e.g.  jacobi coordinates , allowing the energy eigenstates to be expressed as an unentangled product of center - of - mass and relative wave functions .",
    "this separation is exact for any configuration of free particles due to galilean invariance , and it is also exact for a quadratic trap ( even with unequal masses ) as long as the non - interacting trap oscillation frequencies for the particles are all the same  @xcite . here we will restrict ourselves to the case of equal masses for simplicity .",
    "this will ensure center - of - mass vs.  relative separability even when we add interparticle interactions to construct the full hamiltonian .",
    "the case of equal masses also provides another kind of separability .",
    "as we discuss below , the trap hamiltonian has @xmath3 symmetry , and this symmetry allows the trap hamiltonian to be superintegrable , and therefore separable in multiple coordinate systems .    beyond these exact separability results , a standard class of approximations to increase separability",
    "are called adiabatic approximations .",
    "for example , the born - oppenheimer approximation effectively separates the electronic and nuclear wave functions by assuming the electronic wave function varies at a much faster scale than the nuclear wave function . in the context of the three - body problem ,",
    "a similar approximation is made when using hyperspherical coordinates to represent the relative degrees of freedom when solving time - independent schrdinger equation  @xcite or faddeev equations  @xcite in coordinate space .",
    "a good low - energy approximation is to effectively separate the wave function in terms of the hyperradius and hyperangle by neglecting the variation of the wave function in hyperradius when solving the hyperangular equation .",
    "this adiabatic approximation becomes exact in the unitary limit  @xcite .",
    "this occurs because the zero - range contact interaction preserves a dynamical scale invariance that introduces a hidden @xmath4 symmetry to the problem  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of working in one - dimension is that the six - dimensional ` three - body hyperspherical relative coordinates ' are just two - dimensional cylindrical coordinates . in one - dimension",
    ", the separation between hyperangle and hyperradius that emerges in the unitary limit will be easily evident ; the three - fermion states are the exact solution in this limit and we will see that they are separable in this sense .",
    "the truncated hilbert space approximation maps the infinite - dimensional hilbert space of the trapped three - body system onto a truncated model space constructed from exact solutions of the trap hamiltonian without particle interactions . in a sense , this employs the most basic sense of reducibility : all finite - dimensional hilbert spaces can be reduced to a sum of subspaces corresponding to degenerate eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian .",
    "procedures can be used to generate an effective hamiltonian that is corrected for the energy cut - off due to truncation and which handle the difficulties in implementing a possibly non - hermitian , non - renormalizaible , highly singular zero - range interparticle interaction in a consistent way .",
    "for example , such a method has employed by the no - core shell model with a hamiltonian renormalized using effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "similar truncated hilbert space models but with different approaches to regularization are employed in @xcite and @xcite . in one - dimension",
    ", we will not have these difficulties with renormalization and regularization , but we will be able to clearly see the effect of the energy cut - off on the deviation of approximate results from the exact values in the universal , unitary limit .    to further enhance reducibility , we will exploit the discrete point symmetry @xmath0 of the relative configuration space .",
    "this symmetry group is the geometrical realization of the permutation group of three particles , combined with the overall parity inversion symmetry . utilizing properties of the irreducible representations of this group make two calculational steps much more efficient , as is well - known in applications from molecular and chemical physics .",
    "first , diagonalizing the full hamiltonian in the truncated hilbert space can be made more efficient because there are only non - zero matrix elements of the interaction between states in the same representation of @xmath0 .",
    "second , implementing superselection rules to handle indistinguishable particles is automatic : only a few representations are relevant depending on which particles ( if any ) are indistinguishable .",
    "we will apply our method to the cases of three indistinguishable bosons ( bbb ) , two bosons and another particle ( bbx ) , three indistinguishable fermions ( fff ) , two indistinguishable fermions and one other particle ( ffx ) and three distinguishable particles ( xyz ) . as discussed below , we assume there is no entanglement between the internal states of the particles and the motional state , or among the internal states of the particle .",
    "it is specifically the application of the @xmath0 symmetry , when used in combination with hyperspherical coordinates and a truncated hilbert space approach , that we argue provides a meaningful efficiency improvement over existing methods .",
    "in particular , several authors have discussed the computational difficulties of implementing particle symmetries in a variety of truncated hilbert space models  @xcite , and we believe this is an elegant , extensible method for solving these difficulties efficiently .      besides our motivation to demonstrate our method and its connection to previous methods , there is genuine theoretical and experimental interest in quantum gases and other ultracold atomic systems trapped in one - dimension .",
    "see , for example , the recent review @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not consider this application to be merely a `` toy model '' .",
    "an effective one - dimensional description emerges as a limit of the three - dimensional case as the harmonic trap becomes long in one direction and tight in the transverse plane , see for example  @xcite .",
    "a surprising number of the structures of interest that are found in the three - dimensional case , universal and otherwise , will also be manifest in the one - dimensional problem  @xcite .",
    "for example , when the interaction is attractive and sufficiently strong for three indistinguishable bosons , the system manifests all the classes of bound states found for attractive contact interactions in a three - dimensional harmonic potential : trimer states , dimer plus single atom states , and states of three bound atoms . in the spectra",
    "below , the emergence of universality in the unitary limit also will be evident .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the model hamiltonian for three equal - mass particles in one - dimension , establish notation , and begin a discussion of the symmetries of the hamiltonian that will continue into section iii . in both sections , the usefulness of the jacobi hyperspherical ( i.e.  cylindrical ) relative coordinates for visualizing and analyzing configuration space will be emphasized . in section iv",
    ", we provide results for the energy eigenstates and show how the richness of three - body physics is evidenced even in this simple model",
    ". beyond the advantages of analytic power and explanatory appeal , studying this system in one - dimension also suggests extensions of this method to more complicated cases , like more particles , non - equal mass particles , genuine multi - body interactions , higher dimensions , and anisotropic traps .",
    "the final section contains a few remarks about these possible applications .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath5 can be written as the sum of the harmonic trap hamiltonian @xmath6 , which in position space is @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the sum of the three two - particle interaction terms @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the potential @xmath8 represents the idealization of a zero - range ` contact interaction ' .",
    "because it is comprised of the sum of three one - dimensional delta functions and it is self - adjoint , there will be no need for regularization , renormalization or other techniques to tame singularities and divergences the full hamiltonian in the truncated shell model ( although such techniques can improve the rate of convergence ) .",
    "as is usual , we change to scaled , unitless coordinates using the length scale @xmath11 : @xmath12 then defining @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the hamiltonian takes the simpler form @xmath15    the form ( [ eq : h0part ] ) for @xmath6 suggests the trivial observation that the hamiltonian of three equal - mass harmonic oscillators in one dimension is isomorphic to one isotropic harmonic oscillator in three dimensions ( forgetting for the moment about any superselection rules ) .",
    "this system and its @xmath16 symmetry are well - known in the literature . here",
    "we note that the trap hamiltonian is separable in cartesian , cylindrical and spherical coordinates and therefore we can define three classes of energy eigenbasis vectors : @xmath17 in these equations , all the @xmath18 s and @xmath19 can be any non - negative integers and @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be any integer .",
    "we define the total excitation number @xmath22 as @xmath23 in the absence of any superselection rules , the eigenspace associated to energy @xmath24 has a dimension of @xmath25 .",
    "the three classes of bases in ( [ eq:3bases ] ) are just different ways of diagonalizing the degeneracies of @xmath26 , the @xmath27 subspace of @xmath28 . from this",
    "we can also calculate the dimension of the truncated hilbert space @xmath29 with maximum excitation number @xmath22 as @xmath30 .",
    "for each of the three types of separable bases in ( [ eq:3bases ] ) , the @xmath31 symmetry also provides an equivalence class of energy eigenbases .",
    "take @xmath32 as a unitary representation of @xmath33 , then any bases of the form @xmath34 are also complete energy eigenbases for the total hilbert space @xmath28 .",
    "further , @xmath32 only connects basis vectors with the same total excitation @xmath22 ( note that @xmath32 may be reducible within the degenerate energy eigenspace @xmath26 ) . as an example , in the cartesian basis @xmath35 , the quantum numbers @xmath36 no longer represent particle excitations , but excitations of some state corresponding to a particular structure of particle correlations characterized by the particular element @xmath37 .",
    "consider the specific element @xmath38 corresponding to the rotation in configuration space from particle coordinates @xmath39 to one set of jacobi coordinates @xmath40 : @xmath41 coordinate @xmath42 is the ( normalized ) center - of - mass of three particles and coordinates @xmath43 and @xmath44 are one possible arrangement of the standard ( normalized ) jacobi coordinates   and therefore the momentum transforms canonically under the same rotation and there is no need to adjust mass values .",
    "additionally , some use the definition @xmath45 ( compare to ( [ eq : jcyl ] ) ) . ] . in these coordinates ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "see figure [ fig1 ] for a graphical representation of the jacobi rotation @xmath48 . note that since @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath49 , the full hamiltonian still separates in terms of center - of - mass and relative coordinates .",
    "this means that instead of needing @xmath30 states to calculate the ground state energy in a truncated hilbert space with maximum energy @xmath27 , we only need @xmath50 because there are only non - zero matrix elements of @xmath8 between vectors with the same quantum number for center - of - mass excitations .",
    "positive particle axes are solid arrows ; the jacobi cartesian positive axes are dashed arrows .",
    "the @xmath51 direction points into the middle of the solid angle bounded by the all - positive octant and the @xmath52 and @xmath53 are orthogonal directions in the relative plane , depicted as a gray disk for @xmath54 , i.e.  the center - of - mass at the bottom of the potential well .",
    "this jacobi rotation takes place around the yellow ( light gray , unlabeled ) vector and is about 1.22 radians . ]",
    "we will denote the cylindrical @xmath6 energy eigenbasis in the jacobi coordinate system as @xmath55 . in the next section",
    ", we will show that these states are a convenient basis for irreducible representations of the @xmath0 symmetry of the full hamiltonian @xmath5 , but here we note a few additional properties .",
    "the center - of - mass motion separates from the relative motion so @xmath56 .",
    "the wave functions realizing the center - of - mass state @xmath57 in the @xmath49-coordinate are the normal one - dimensional harmonic oscillator states : @xmath58 on the plane perpendicular to @xmath49 that describes the relative motion of the three particles , we can define the `` hyperspherical coordinates '' @xmath59 and @xmath60 from @xmath61 and @xmath62 using the standard conversion to cylindrical coordinates @xmath63 then the realization of the relative state @xmath64 as wave functions in the jacobi cylindrical coordinate @xmath59 and @xmath60 are @xmath65 note that only @xmath66 states are not zero at @xmath67 and therefore have some probability density for configurations in which all three particles are located in the same place . see figure [ fig2 ] for further explanation of the correspondence between particle configurations and jacobi cylindrical coordinates .    ) .",
    "for example , the line with @xmath68 corresponds to increasing separation of particle 1 ( depicted as a red circle ) from particles 2 ( green square ) and 3 ( blue triangle ) , with particle 1 on positive side and the other two co - located on the negative side .",
    "reflections across the magenta ( dashed ) lines also represent two - particle exchanges , e.g. the reflection through the line @xmath68 corresponds to the @xmath69 2-cycle .",
    "rotations of @xmath70 are 3-cycles , i.e.  three - particle exchanges .",
    "a rotation of @xmath71 corresponds to a reversal of parity @xmath72 .",
    "reflections across the cyan ( dotted ) lines are a combination of a two - particle exchange and a parity inversion , e.g. @xmath73 . ]",
    "expressed in jacobi cylindrical coordinates , the interaction @xmath8 takes takes the form   in this equation does not cause problems for the integrals we will be considering because of the measure of integration will cancel this singularity . ]",
    "@xmath74 to understand this functional form , note that the zeros of the delta - functions define three planes in full configuration space that intersect the relative @xmath75-plane in three lines ( the dashed magenta lines in figure [ fig2 ] ) .",

    "the rays along @xmath68 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 correspond to the configurations where one particle has a positive @xmath78-coordinate and the other two particles have the same negative @xmath78-coordinate . the rays with angles @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are configurations with the reverse orientation .",
    "from this form we can see that the potential @xmath8 manifests the two - dimensional point symmetry that is usually denoted @xmath0 , i.e.  the symmetries of the regular hexagon .",
    "the finite group @xmath0 has twelve elements : the identity , two rotations by @xmath82 , two rotations by @xmath83 , one rotation by @xmath71 and six reflections of two different types .",
    "the group @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the permutation group of three objects and would be geometrically realized the jacobi relative plane by @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87 symmetry corresponds to the parity invariance of the relative configuration space , which is respected by both @xmath6 and @xmath8 to realize the parity invariance of the hamiltonian in the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath49 and then the geometric realization would be @xmath88 , the point symmetry of a regular hexagonal prism .",
    "this would cause an additional doubling of representations , but since the interaction does not affect the center - of - mass it does not provide any additional efficiency in calculations . ] .",

    "first , the states whose energies are are approximately horizontal for @xmath127 are three - atom states .",
    "this can be most easily seen for the low energy states , where as @xmath128 becomes much larger than @xmath119 the bosonic states become effectively fermionic , i.e.  they approach the exact energy and degeneracy expected for the non - interacting , postive - parity three - fermion @xmath126 sector .",
    "the wave functions for these states all have maximum amplitudes in the sectors of relative space corresponding to three disparate particles , specifically @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath70 . in other words ,",
    "in these spectra we can observe the tonks - girardeau phenomenon of fermionization of bosons with strong interactions  @xcite .",
    "these states can be considered universal in the unitary limit of @xmath131 because the energy levels only depend on the trap parameters and not the interaction  @xcite . for higher energy states near the cutoff , the numerical agreement between the bosonic state and the corresponding fermionic limit becomes less precise , although the bands still have the correct degeneracy .",
    "this systematic effect is due to the truncation of the hilbert space , and occurs even though the interaction potential is renormalizable in one - dimension .",
    "methods from nuclear physics exist for transforming the hamiltonian into an effective hamiltonian to account for this effect , e.g. the block - horowitz approach used in @xcite or the lee - suzuki method from @xcite , and these will be explored in subsequent work .    for @xmath132 , the three - atom ` gaseous ' states would not be stable in figure [ fig : bosona ] , but could decay into ` liquidlike / solidlike ' states  @xcite consisting of the two other types of states : trimer states and atom - dimer states .",

    "are the atom - dimer states , which diverge as @xmath133 decreases from zero and the dimer becomes more tightly bound . for @xmath134 , the energy eigenvalue diverges roughly quadratically , and the difference between the different atom - dimer states is just the energy cost of exciting the atom and/or dimer to a greater value of @xmath135 . for @xmath136 ,",
    "the atom - dimer and trimer states appear to diverge linearly , but this is again a limitation of the truncated hilbert space .",
    "as one increases the number of basis vectors in this section , the expected quadratic divergence holds for larger values of of the interaction parameter @xmath133 . additionally , more atom - dimer states appear and the spacing between those levels for a given @xmath132 becomes more exactly @xmath137 .",
    "a couple other interesting features are the stepped cascades of gaseous states for increasing negative values of @xmath133 and the divergent states with @xmath138 .",
    "the divergent states for @xmath138 are again an artifact of the truncation .",
    "as the cutoff is raised and additional energy levels are added , the lowest divergent states bend down to the fermionic limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the cascade structure is not an artifact of the truncation .",
    "as higher energy levels are added , the steps of the cascading energy level become more regular for low negative @xmath133 .",
    "these structures depends on coupling between @xmath139 states of different relative ( configuration space ) angular momenta and are absent when that coupling is removed .    as a final comparison",
    ", we also include figure [ fig : ffxe1b1 ] which depicts the spectrum for the @xmath140/@xmath126 representation , corresponding to an ffx configuration , such as two spin - up fermions and one spin - down fermion .",

    "some extensions to more particles of the method described here are straightforward .",
    "for example , the representation theory of permutation groups in three dimensions is well - known , and an extension to four particles in one - dimension can be accomplished using the octahedral symmetry of the relative configuration space .",
    "further extensions to more than five particles in one dimension require using the less - familiar ( at least from molecular and solid state physics ) point groups in higher dimensions , which have been classified by coxeter and others .",
    "since the three - body problem in one - dimension carries so many properties of the three - dimensional system , such as universality and bound state structure , this line of investigation seems promising .    when extending this method to higher particle numbers _ and _ higher dimensions , for example @xmath22 particles in @xmath142 dimensions ,",
    "one difficulty is that the realization of the permutation group @xmath143 in @xmath144 no longer commutes with the @xmath144-representation of the @xmath145 symmetry of the two - particle interaction , a symmetry that is also no longer a discrete symmetry .",
    "contrast this with the present case : the @xmath146 realization of @xmath85 in the jacobi plane commutes with the @xmath146 parity representation of the discrete @xmath147 symmetry of the interaction .",

    "such geometric realizations of the symmetries of the relative configurations of three particles appear in the construction of talmi - moshinksy brackets used in @xcite and the perturbative expansion solution of faddeev equations in @xcite .",
    "additionally , in higher dimensions there are the difficulties of renormalization of the zero - range interaction , but methods from effective field theory and/or regularization have previously been used to study these interactions in truncated hilbert spaces and their results should be extensible .",
    "similar approaches will also be necessary if genuine multi - body interactions are included ; for example , a term proportional to @xmath148 in the three - body , one - dimensional case .    for anisotropic traps ,",
    "the rotational symmetry is gone , but there can still be reflection symmetries whose representations can be exploited for constructing symmetry adapted bases using these methods , as shown by @xcite .",
    "similarly , even with particle of uneven masses , discrete symmetries can help reduce the problem in a numerically more efficient way .    as a final comment ,",
    "the same symmetry techniques that provide efficiency through separability and reducibility in the present work should also be useful for calculating the entanglement among atoms using truncated hilbert spaces .",

    ", these coefficients can be used to find the distance from the energy eigenstate to a separable state as quantified by any atom - dimer bipartition . in the case of indistinguishable fermions ,",
