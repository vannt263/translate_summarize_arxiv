    "studying the ephemerides , or orbital parameters , of nearby planets is one of the oldest sub - fields in astronomy .",
    "it took nearly 1500 years for a new celestial model to supplant ptolemy s stationary , geocentric system specifically because , through the use of a number of clever maneuvers ( equants , epicycles , and deferents ) , he was able to accurately predict the motion of the solar system planets @xcite . and it was precisely because copernicus heliocentric model did _ not _ predict accurate planetary phenomena that nearly 100 years passed before the theory was generally accepted by the scientific community . with the purpose of improving orbital uncertainties and fundamental properties of the host star , the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) team",
    "seeks to characterize individual nearby planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the giant planet around hd  130322 , a k0 star , was first detected by @xcite using the radial velocity ( rv ) technique via the coralie echelle spectrograph .",
    "they reported the period of the planet was @xmath6 days , @xmath7 , and eccentricity of @xmath8 .",
    "the planet was later confirmed by @xcite , who observed an additional 12 rv measurements using keck and determined that the period was @xmath9 days , @xmath10 , and an eccentricity of @xmath11 .",
    "the giant planet was further observed by @xcite using both the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) and the harlan j. smith telescope .",
    "they found the combination of all four datasets produced a large root - mean - square ( rms ) variability of 14.8 ms@xmath12 and an anomalous periodicity at 35 days , specifically due to coralie data .",
    "their orbital parameters , without the rv measurements by @xcite , found @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . because of the small eccentricity , @xcite was not able to put a lower bound on the mass of the planet as determined by tidal constraints , only an upper limit of 43.8 . observations using the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph by @xcite resulted in the detection of a debris disk around the host star .    here",
    "we present our complete rv data set from a number of sources ( including those mentioned above in addition to previously unpublished measurements from the 10 m keck i telescope ) that has a time baseline of @xmath114 years , discussed in ",
    "the analysis of the keplerian orbital solution of these data produce refined orbital ephemeris for the host star hd  130322 , with a predicted transit depth of 1.57% , and 1@xmath16 transit window of 0.329 days (  [ keplerian ] ) . in  [ photometry ] , we determine the differential magnitude of the host star with respect to multiple comparison stars in order to better understand seasonal and nightly brightness fluctuations .",
    "the evaluation of starspot variability (  [ starspot ] ) allows us to calculate a stellar rotation period , while understanding the stellar magnetic activity (  [ magact ] ) gives us insight into the age of hd  130322 .",
    "the hd  130322 system has been monitored via the rv technique several times in the past .",
    "we provide a complete rv data set that consists of 118 measurements acquired with coralie at the 1.2 m euler - swiss telescope @xcite , 35 measurements acquired with the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope and the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) on the het @xcite , and 24 measurements acquired with the hires echelle spectrometer on the 10 m keck i telescope @xcite , the most recent 12 of which are previously unpublished .",
    "we use this combined data set ( shown in table [ 130322rv ] ) in order to calculate the fundamental properties of the star as well as the keplerian orbital solution of the planet .",
    "we derive the host star properties by fitting the high resolution hires , hrs , and coralie data with spectroscopy made easy @xcite , or sme , via the wavelength intervals , line data , and technique of @xcite .",
    "we applied the revised _",
    "hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite to the @xcite methodology as well as surface gravity from a yonsei - yale stellar structure model @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the fundamental stellar parameters are listed in table [ starparams ] , where v - magnitude and distance were determined by _ hipparcos _ ,",
    "@xmath17 from tycho-2 , while effective temperature , surface gravity , projected rotational velocity , stellar mass , and stellar radius were a result of sme .",
    "the high precision of the stellar radius , namely r@xmath18 = 0.85@xmath50.04 r@xmath19 , is important when determining the depth and duration of a possible planetary transit . as a comparison to the sme result",
    ", the stellar radius was determined using the torres relation @xcite : r@xmath18 = 0.88@xmath50.04 r@xmath19 .",
    "we have also conducted an empirical surface brightness calculation per @xcite which averages the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 surface brightness relations , resulting in an angular diameter of 0.252 @xmath5 0.006 mas .",
    "folding in the parallax and error , the radius is 0.89@xmath50.04 r@xmath19 .",
    "all three of these techniques show a very strong consensus for both the stellar radius and error of the host star . the iron abundance",
    ", [ fe / h ] , as determined by sme , as well as other element abundances , will be discussed in  [ abunds ] .    while our results are consistent with a typical k - type star @xcite , we note the differences between stellar properties in @xcite , namely , their table 1 and our table [ starparams ] .",
    "we have used the updated _ hipparcos _ @xcite catalog , which may account for the varying @xmath17 and distance determinations ; they cited @xmath23 0.781 and the distance to be 29.76 pc .",
    "our effective temperature , 5387 @xmath5 44 , is also + 50 k above their referenced temperatures .",
    "stellar abundances have been measured for hd  130322 by at least a dozen different groups , for example @xcite . due to the proximity of the host star to the sun , 31.54 pc , a wide variety of elements",
    "have been measured within hd  130322 , from @xmath24-type to neutron - capture .",
    "using the same analysis as seen in _ hypatia catalog _",
    "@xcite , we renormalized the abundance measurements for each dataset to the same solar scale @xcite and then determined the maximum measurement variation between the groups , or the _ spread _ , to quantify the consistency of the abundances . when analyzing the abundances in the _ hypatia catalog _ , element measurements",
    "were only considered where the _ spread _ was less than the respective error bar associated with that element , or where group - to - group variations were small , and then the median value was used . for hd  130322 , [ fe / h ] = 0.12 dex , however the spread between the groups was 0.23 dex .",
    "in other words , the iron ratio was not agreed upon by the various groups , where the renormalized @xcite measurement was [ fe / h ] = 0.04 and renormalized @xcite determined [ fe / h ] = 0.27 dex .",
    "for this reason , hd  130322 was not included in the analysis ( or reduced version ) of the _ hypatia catalog_. per the sme analysis , [ fe / h ] = 0.07 @xmath5 0.03 dex , using the discussion and solar abundance scale in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization gives [ fe / h ] = 0.11 , which is very close to the median value found for the other data sets in hypatia .",
    "there were a number of other elements within the star that were measured by different groups .",
    "per the _ hypatia _ analysis , where the spread in the abundances were less than respective error and the median value taken : [ n / fe ] = -0.14 dex , [ al / fe ] = -0.12 dex , [ s / fe ] = -0.14 dex , [ cu / fe ] = -0.15 dex , [ sr / fe ] = 0.07 dex , [ yii / fe ] = -0.09 dex , [ baii / fe ] = -0.06 dex , [ ce / fe ] = 0.07 dex , [ ceii / fe ] = -0.05 dex , and [ euii / fe ] = -0.18 dex .",
    "in general , we find that the majority of abundances well measured in hd  130322 are significantly sub - solar . despite measuring [ fe / h ] = 0.07 @xmath5 0.03 via sme ,",
    "not much can be said conclusively about the overall [ fe / h ] content , given the large spread in the abundances determined by different methods .",
    "we fit a keplerian orbital solution to the rv data ( shown in table [ 130322rv ] ) using the partially linearized , least - squares fitting procedure described in @xcite with parameter uncertainties estimated using the boottran bootstrapping routines from @xcite .",
    "the resulting keplerian orbital solution is shown in table [ fitparams ] , where the stellar parameters for the host star described in section [ star ] and summarized in table [ starparams ] were used to determine the minimum mass and semi - major axis of the planet .",
    "the phased data and residuals to the fit are shown in fig .",
    "we find the offsets to be 24.3 , 24.7 , -27.2 , and -23.6 ms@xmath12 for data from 2.7 m mcdonald observatory telescope ( 2.7 m ) , coralie , hires ( pre-2004 or bjd prior to 13005.5 ) , and hires ( post-2004 ) , respectively .",
    "regarding the coralie data , the median velocity value was subtracted from the data and the velocities were converted from km / s to m / s , which were then used to calculate the offsets with respect to the het s hrs data .",
    "the fit including the coralie data has a @xmath25 and rms  @xmath26  ms@xmath12 . without the coralie data , these numbers change to 1.46 and 8.67 , respectively .",
    "however , the time baseline of the coralie data significantly improves the determination of the orbital period so our fit includes these data for the subsequent analysis .",

    "another minor caveat should be noted for the 2004 and 2011 observing seasons . in both cases , the first harmonic of the rotation period",

    "the individual rotation periods scatter about that mean with a standard deviation of 2.44  days , and the standard deviation of the mean is 0.70  days .",
    "therefore , we determine that @xmath84  days is our most accurate calculation for the star s rotation period , which matches well with the rotation period derived by @xcite , or @xmath85  days , from the first six seasons of our apt data set .",
    "we note the significantly smaller uncertainty in our determination due to the greatly extended 14 year baseline .",
    "we found typical starspot - filling factors of one percent or less in column  6 of table [ seasons ] , where the peak - to - peak amplitudes for each season range from 0.0020.017  mag .",
    "because the stellar rotation period of 26.53  days is more than a factor of two from the 10.7 day planetary rv period and harmonics , in addition to the small impact from starspots , we find that the 10.7-day planet could not be the result of stellar activity .",
    "examining the stellar rotation with respect to inclination , we first assume that the inclination of rotation axis for hd  130322 is close to @xmath86 , in which case the stellar radius ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath88  km  s@xmath12 ) predict a stellar rotation period of @xmath89  days . because this value is over three times longer than our observed value of @xmath90  days , the logical conclusion is that the stellar rotation axis must have a low inclination and a low planetary transit probability . however , if we substitute the value of @xmath91 km  s@xmath12 from @xcite , the predicted rotation period is 26.55  days , identical to our observed rotation period within the uncertainties .",
    "this implies a very _ high _ inclination near @xmath86 and , therefore , a high probability of transits .",

    "similarly , the yearly average of the comparison stars @xmath68 is given in the bottom panel , with a very small standard deviation of 0.0005  mag .",
    "since the comparison stars demonstrate photometric stability over the 13 observing seasons , the fluctuations seen in middle two panels must be intrinsic to the host - star hd  130322 .    the variations in h  and  k and apt observations plotted in fig .",
    "[ mags ] appear to be cyclic .",
