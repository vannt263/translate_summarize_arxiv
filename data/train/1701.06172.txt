    "in particular , our nosneagn simulation has the deepest low density gas penetration at @xmath79 . in this case due to",
    "the no sn heating and the low bh mass ( few @xmath80 m@xmath3 ) , agn feedback is unable to alter significantly the low density @xmath1 kpc scale accretion . at lower redshift",
    "the bh experiences a prolonged eddington limited accretion rate ( as discussed in the following ) that increases its mass by a factor of @xmath1 a few , injecting in turn energy in the interstellar and circum - galactic media .",
    "such energy injection clearly affects the low density gas accretion rate at @xmath22 , as we can see from the figure : the low density gas barely reaches the virial radius .",
    "we note that the expression in eq .",
    "[ accrate ] includes mass inflows associated to inward radial motions triggered by local thermal fluctuations . in order to asses how important are the local thermal fluctuations to the mass accretion rate , we compute the radial velocity dispersion @xmath81 in the no feedback simulation of pe16 .",
    "then , for each simulation presented in this work , we compute the mass accretion rate including all the material with radial velocity @xmath82 i.e. we excluded local thermal fluctuations . following this procedure",
    "we can see that at @xmath1 virial radius scales the local velocity fluctuations are no more than @xmath83 of the total accreted matter .",

    "such accretion rates of order @xmath1 few tens of m@xmath73 at the outer galactic edge are associated to free fall material reaching the central dm halo region from large scales , as discussed in pe16 .      the tight relation between the large scale @xmath85 dynamic and the small scale @xmath86 evolution in the galaxy formation context ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "after to flow at almost free fall from scales above @xmath89 till the galactic edge ( at @xmath77 ) triggered by gravity and channelized through dm filaments around the dm halo , the angular momentum ( am ) re - distribution in the galaxy will produce mt , allowing the gas to flow in and to reach the center of the system .",
    "due to the nature of the system at study , the sources of am variations are related to gravitational forces and pressure gradients , namely : @xmath90 @xmath91 the gravitational , @xmath92 , and the pressure gradient , @xmath93 , torques will act as source of am transport in the galactic system and provide clues about the mt process in high redshift galaxies .",

    "this is the consequence of two processes : shocks due to the large scale in - falling gas onto the dm halo central region and shocks due to sne and agn feedback .",
    "there are , however , some regions of gravity domination above @xmath1 100 pc . the pressure gradient domination is clearer at smaller radii . only at high redshift",
    "@xmath97 gravity dominates the center of the system . in the case without sn feedback the gravitational torque has a contribution at smaller radii ( @xmath98 few tens pc ) compared with the sn feedback simulations .",

    "the combined effect of gravity and pressure gradients re - distributes am in the disk and triggers mt that feeds the central bh in these systems .",
    "we note that due to the mass difference ( above @xmath1 one order of magnitude in dm halo ) our results does not completely agree with the ones presented in @xcite .",
    "these authors show that the gravitational torque dominates on the galactic disc . as mentioned above such a difference",
    "arises due to the bigger mass of their studied systems at lower redshift .",
    "as shown in the previous section , high redshift galaxies receive almost free falling material from large scale and experience torques associated with gravitational forces and pressure gradients which trigger mt in the galaxy . in this context",

    "accretion rates fluctuate between @xmath1 @xmath106 m@xmath73 and @xmath1 @xmath107 m@xmath73 with an average accretion rate of the order @xmath108 m@xmath73 .",
    "the accretion rate profiles show a number of gaps associated to sn outflows and gas clumps crossing and leaving the system .",
    "the lack of sn heating in the nosneagn simulation causes smoother accretion rate profiles compared with all the sn feedback simulations .",
    "furthermore , in simulations with agn feedback gas does not easily reach the central galactic region , @xmath109 pc , i.e. agn feedback efficiently ejects gas from the galactic center as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "we have shown that after to flow almost radially at free fall from scales above @xmath89 and reach the galactic outer region , gravitational and pressure gradient torques can produce a substantial mass accretion rate of the order @xmath108 m@xmath3/yr at distances @xmath110 few 10 pc from the center of the system in high redshift galaxies .",
    "we now move to explore the bh mass growth and how dynamical features of the system depend on sn and agn feedback .",
    "we show the bh accretion rate as a function of redshift in fig .",
    "as already shown by pe16 , the sn explosions have a clear effect on the central bh mass accretion rate ejecting gas out of system and then decreasing the amount of material that can feed the bh throughout the simulation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this is especially important at @xmath111 , when the halo mass is @xmath87 @xmath112 m@xmath3 and the stellar mass @xmath87 few @xmath113 m@xmath3 . under such conditions",

    "this behavior continues to @xmath119 , when the now sufficiently massive bh is capable to accelerate the surrounding gas beyond the central escape velocity .",
    "the lack of sn heating allows the gas to easily reach the galactic center and pile up to feed the bh . at the same time",

    "in general , the feedback simulations presented here develop outflows with @xmath162 .    when we look at the hot gas at high redshift , @xmath128 , the nosneagn run produces slower hot gas compared with all the sn feedback simulations .",
    "in this case the agn activity can not accelerate the hot galactic gas above @xmath163 .",
    "in other words , without the sn heating the hot gas can not be accelerated above this velocity during the eddington - limited growth phase of the bh .",
    "sn feedback can create a low density rarefied hot environment where energy injection from sne ( and agn feedback for the sneagn run ) can easily accelerate the gas .",
    "in contrast , without sn feedback , the heated gas is surrounded by high density gas and it is much more difficult to accelerate it at higher velocities .",
    "we note that this fast hot gas is no more than a few percent of the total enclosed gas mass .",
    "note that this result differs quantitatively , but not qualitatively , from @xcite because they simulate a more massive halo of @xmath164 at @xmath22 powering a luminous quasar , while the halo in our simulations is of much lower mass @xmath165 and agn feedback remains weak , and its effect limited .    in the cold gas phase ,",
    "clear differences exist between our experiments . without agn feedback ,",
    "cold gas can not be accelerated above @xmath166 , as shown also by @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of agn feedback can accelerate cold gas to higher velocities , up to @xmath167 , for the case without sne and up to @xmath168 , for the case with both sn and agn feedback .",
    "this confirms , in a different regime , that combined effect of supernovae and agn feedback boost each other and is what accelerates the cold gas : the agn accelerates further the gas than has been already accelerated by sne . finally , note that the large time scale ratios @xmath148 for the nosneagn are caused by the lack of metal enrichment .    in the redshift interval",
    "@xmath169 the picture remains similar , but the now more massive bhs produce a more efficient agn feedback , especially on the cold gas .",
    "this efficiency increases with time , and at @xmath170 the nosneagn simulation shows hot gas outflows up to @xmath171 , but not beyond , in contrast with all the cases including sn feedback , which go as high as @xmath172 . in the cold gas phase , sne alone",
    "become completely ineffective at accelerating the cold gas , and it is only in the presence of an agn that cold gas can be affected in the now massive galaxy ( see the discussion in dubois et al .",
    "2015 ) . additionally , in the sne only case , @xmath173 for the cold gas at @xmath170 , while time ratios of order @xmath174 are present in the simulations including agn feedback .",
    "the cold gas in the no - eddington limit simulation ( not shown ) can surpass the @xmath168 during super - eddington accretion episodes at redshift above ten .",
    "below @xmath175 the outflows can reach @xmath176 during super - eddington episodes .",
    "those episodes , however , are very short lived , and are followed by long quiescent periods , therefore the outflow velocity , averaged over hundreds of myr , remains low .",
    "note that inside @xmath147 the mass of hot gas is much lower than the mass of cold gas in our simulations . at @xmath128 hot gas is not more than few percent of the total gas mass inside @xmath177 of the virial radius , increasing to a few per cent at @xmath169 . in the final redshift range , @xmath170 , all the simulations including sn feedback reach values in the range @xmath178 .",
    "the nosneagn feedback remains at @xmath179 of hot gas and is the case with the lowest hot gas fraction also in the previous redshift intervals .",
    "the discussion on the bh accretion rate and gas velocities presented in the previous sections now allows us to understand the bh and stellar mass evolution in this high - redshift galaxy .",
    "[ f10 ] shows the bh and galaxy stellar mass evolution as a function of redshift .",
    "the sne simulation ( black ) reaches the highest bh mass at the end of the experiment ( except for the run with no feedback at all described in pe16 and reported here for comparison ) .",
    "sn feedback can accelerate the gas because of pressure gradients associated to temperature differences of the order @xmath180 k ( depending on the gas density ) in the galactic disc .",
    "as shown in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , due to the high mass concentration around the bh ( and its high escape velocity ) the bh in the nosneagn case has the fastest growth at high redshift amongst all our simulations , comparable with the no feedback case of pe16 . as shown in table [ table ] , the bh grows at the eddington rate at @xmath128 , until it reaches @xmath181 m@xmath3 . at this stage agn feedback",
    "is capable of accelerating the surrounding gas beyond the central escape velocity , reducing dramatically the bh growth rate .",
    "the bh ends the simulation with a mass of @xmath182 m@xmath3 .    at the beginning of the evolution",
    ", the sneagnnoedd bh shows a large mass jump , increasing almost by three times its initial value due to short bursts of super - eddington accretion accompanied by strong feedback .",
    "afterward , as discussed in the previous sections , the central region is devoid of gas and bh growth is stunted until a merger at @xmath146 that replenishes the gas supply and the bh experiences a high super - eddington accretion ( @xmath183 ) episode increasing its mass by almost one order of magnitude . by this time , however , agn feedback is not as disruptive anymore in the denser and more massive nucleus and the bh continues its evolution with irregular mass accretion rate and with more super - eddington episodes .",
    "the sneagn feedback has the slowest mass growth and then it reaches the lowest mass at the end of the simulation ( @xmath184 m@xmath3 ) . in this case , beside the sne outflows , agn activity can create outflows associated to temperature gradients of @xmath185 k , much larger than the ones produced by sne .",
    "this result shows that the combined effect of sne and agn feedback works together to quench efficiently the bh growth .    at @xmath186",
    "all the simulations including agn feedback ( sneagn , nosneagn and sneagnnoedd ) show a sudden change in the bh mass . at this redshift",
    "the system experiences a @xmath187 merger , bringing fresh high density gas to the central galactic region to fuel the bh .",
    "[ f11 ] shows two episodes of rapid bh mass growth for the sneagn simulation , one at @xmath188 and other one at @xmath186 ( mentioned above ) . in this two examples it is possible to associate a merger event with a jump in the bh mass evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "regarding the stellar mass evolution , the simulation with no sne and only agn feedback , nosneagn , produces the galaxy with the highest stellar mass at the end of the simulation , comparable but lower to the nosne run in pe16 .",
    "the final stellar mass is @xmath189 m@xmath3 .",
    "as expected , the lack of fast outflows allows high gas concentration , and therefore an efficient star formation throughout the simulation .",
    "in contrast , all the cases including sn feedback finish the simulation with a lower stellar mass , of the order of @xmath190 m@xmath3 , showing that the bh mass is not large enough in these galaxies to quench star formation .",
    "all the sn feedback simulations have a similar stellar masses at @xmath191 , @xmath192 m@xmath3 . above this redshift",
    "it is possible to see that the stellar masses differ . in other words",
    ", it seems that below @xmath193 m@xmath3 sne and agn feedback produce a larger scatter in the stellar mass content at similar dm halo mass .",
    "we have run cosmological zoom - in simulations of high redshift galaxies in order to study the effect of sn and agn feedback on the mass transport in these objects and their consequences on the central bh growth .    as in pe16",
    "we find that the mass accretion rate beyond the virial radius is of the order of @xmath194 m@xmath73 .",
    "these high mass accretion rates are associated to material in almost free - fall going onto the central dm halo region . in these systems ,",
    "feedback from sne and agn is able to suppress the low density mass accretion at the galactic edge .",
    "material with densities associated with cooling flows , i.e. @xmath195 @xmath40 can not penetrate inside the central @xmath1 kpc .",
    "only high density @xmath196 @xmath40 gas is able to reach the inner @xmath1 few 100 pc .",
    "the simulations with only sne , and the simulation with sne plus agn feedback are those for which the suppression is the highest , in contrast to the agn only experiment where gas can reach the galactic center more easily .    in these turbulent galactic environments ,",
    "torques acting on the gas have two sources : gravity force associated to an inhomogeneous mass distribution and pressure gradients associated to circum - galactic shocks driven by cosmic infall , or sn and agn feedback . such torques are required to re - distribute the gas am from the external edge of the galaxy to the central regions , at @xmath197 pc scales , and trigger a radial mass accretion rate of @xmath198 m@xmath73 .",
    "all the sn feedback simulations produce a lower @xmath199 at @xmath128 compared with their @xmath199 at @xmath129 , showing that sn feedback can quench efficiently bh growth in small galaxies at high redshift until a critical mass is reached @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to see that after merger events , the bh has a significant growth . during such events a large amount of gas reaches the bh , feeding it with fresh gas .",
    "our four simulations show very different bh mass accretion histories depending on the physical ingredients we included .",
    "although sn feedback alone is able to alter dramatically the bh accretion rate @xcite , the sn and agn feedback in tandem are the most efficient to quench the bh growth . due to the high gas density around the bh at high redshift , the simulation without sn feedback can grow near the eddington limit until it reaches the @xmath200 , and self - regulates by its agn activity .",
    "regarding stellar mass growth , agn feedback alone is also unable to regulate sf , although the bh - stellar mass ratio is large , in fact for the nosneagn case , the ratio is well above @xmath30 at almost all times .",
    "sn feedback , in these small galaxies , seems to be much more effective at affecting sf .",
    "our simulations show that most of the central gas inside @xmath177 of the halo virial radius is cold ( @xmath160 k ) .",
    "the hot ( @xmath159 k ) gas is no more than a few percent above redshift @xmath201 . below this redshift , all the simulations including sn feedback increase the amount of hot gas reaching fractions @xmath202 . in contrast , the no sn feedback simulation keeps its hot gas fraction very low @xmath203 over its entire evolution .",
    "the simulation without sn feedback shows that it is not possible to accelerate the hot gas beyond @xmath204 .",
    "in contrast all the sn feedback simulations can easily surpass this value , showing that sn heating creates a low density rarefied gas where the sn and agn feedback accelerate the gas at velocities as high as @xmath205 .",
    "the cold gas phase in the innermost galactic region of the sn feedback simulation can not be accelerated beyond @xmath206 @xcite whereas with agn plus sn feedback the cold gas can reaches up to @xmath207 , showing that the combined effect of sn and agn heating creates the strongest outflows of cold gas and consequently is the most efficient combination to quench the bh and galaxy growth at high redshift .",
    "we note that our results should depend on the bh feedback prescription . in particular",
    "a more realistic approach based on a quasar and radio - jet - like mode as in @xcite would produce a lower effect on the surrounding gas increasing the bh growing rate and reducing the gas outflows velocity . a simulation including a jet like bh feedback will be presented in an up - coming paper .",
