    "however , until late , the simple case of a granular mass collapsing onto an horizontal plane had not been addressed .",

    "essentially , the effect of the initial geometry of the column on the geometry of the final deposit has been investigated .",
    "the main result consists in scaling laws for the runout distance . in particular ,",
    "when the initial aspect ratio of the collapsing column is high enough , the runout distance renormalised by the initial radius of the column shows a power law dependence on the initial aspect ratio .",
    "moreover , this dependence varies depending on the conditions of the experiment , and in particular between the axisymmetric or quasi 2d configurations .",
    "+ although simple models relying on coulomb failure analysis or on shallow water approximation for the flow have been proposed , no clear physical understanding of the granular collapse process has been achieved yet . in particular , the scaling laws obtained for the runout distance are incompatible with a simple basal friction model , and question the mode of energy dissipation occurring in the successive steps of the collapse dynamics .",
    "+ in this context , the use of the numerical simulation to reproduce numerically the collapse of granular columns is expected to give new interesting insights in the problem .",
    "indeed , discrete element methods allow for the simulation of each grain forming the granular mass , giving access to each grain s trajectory . we can thus hope to access a picture of the collapse phenomena otherwise very difficult to obtain from experimental setup .",
    "+ the aim of the present work is to determine which are the mechanisms controlling the spreading dynamics : fall of the column , dissipation at the base , ejection of mass sideways and dissipation within the flow .",
    "therefore , we have applied the contact dynamics algorithm  ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in two dimensions .",
    "the numerical procedures are explained in section  [ num ] .",

    "* ) in section  [ expe ] , the different regimes of spreading are qualitatively described and scaling laws are established in section  [ scale ] .",
    "we observe a very good agreement between the experiments and the simulations .",
    "details of the dynamics of the vertical fall and of the sideways spreading are shown in section  [ dynamics ] .",
    "the dissipation of energy , and the transfer of energy from vertical fall to horizontal motion , are examined in section  [ energy ] .",
    "we show that the amount of energy available for the spreading is simply proportional to the initial potential energy of the column and that basal friction is a very good approximation of the dissipation within the sideways flow .",
    "eventually , we conclude that the ability of the column to eject the grains sideways is a major aspect of the dynamics .",
    "this leads us to question the scaling laws obtained for the runout distance as perhaps fortuitous and corresponding to a transient regime .",
    "a new empirical fit , compatible with a friction law , and qualitatively describing the collapse phenomenology , is proposed in section  [ new ] .",
    "summary of the results and further discussion are presented in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "the numerical methods used for the simulation of granular material are known under the generic name of discrete element methods .",
    "they take into account the individual existence of each discrete grain forming the media , and most usually neglect the role of the interstitial fluid filling the space between the grains .",
    "such an approximation makes dem methods mostly appropriate for the modelling of dry granular matter . in the absence of any dynamics induced by the surrounding fluid ( the air in the present case ) , the behaviour of the collection of grains is entirely driven by the usual equations of motion , and the contact laws ruling the collisions between the grains .",
    "+ the modelling of the contact phenomena consists in a set of relations between the contact force and various quantities referring to the physical and/or chemical processes taking place at the surface of the two bodies in contact .",
    "these microscopic interactions can be of different natures .",
    "they can involve for instance elastic or plastic deformation of asperities , adhesion due to van der waals forces , aging process ... in any case , the complexity of these phenomena can not be directly incorporated in the contact models , first due to practical reasons of numerical feasibility or efficacy , and then , because such complex models are nevertheless not assured to be realistic .",
    "basically , dem methods assume small elastic deformations , with possible viscous effects , and frictional dissipation as contact phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "+ it is beyond the scope of this paper to give a detailed account of the numerical method used , and further informations will be found in dedicated work .",
    "hence we will just specify the main hypothesis ruling the behaviour of the numerical grains . in the absence of a clear physical background for the modelling of contact phenomena ,",
    "a possible strategy is to assume that grains are interacting through hard - core repulsion and non - smooth coulombic friction only .",
    "this modelling choice is adopted in contact dynamics ( cd ) algorithm  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that we have applied for the present work .",
    "this implies that two grains have to touch for the contact force to be non - zero , and no distance interaction is permitted .",
    "once a contact is formed between two grains , the latter can not get closer , and any normal relative motion is repulsive : the grains are perfectly rigid .",
    "the microscopic coefficient of friction @xmath3 characterizes the coulombic friction threshold @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the normal force at contact , and controls the friction dissipation process at grain scale .",
    "the tangential force @xmath6 between two grains in contact can either be below the coulombic friction threshold , and in that case no tangential slip motion is possible , or it can be exactly equal to the coulombic friction threshold , and in that case , slip motion will dissipate energy .",
    "these contact laws allow for the modelling of _ multiple collisions _ between the grains , namely the fact that the grains are in contact with one or more neighbours while they are undergoing collisions with other grains .",
    "however , the simple case of a binary collision is also perfectly described .",
    "a newtonian coefficient of restitution @xmath7 is introduced , which controls the velocity of the grains after the collision knowing the velocity before the collision .",
    "this coefficient of restitution also appears in the prediction of the velocity of all the grains in the solving process . + these contact laws are simplistic with regards to the microscopic reality of contact phenomena .",

    "+ the numerical experiment consists in releasing a column of grains in the gravity field onto a flat bottom plane , and study the collapse and the resulting spreading dynamics of the granular mass .",
    "the bottom plane in our experiment is perfectly smooth .",
    "laboratory experiments carried out on rough or smooth surfaces have shown that the general behaviour of the mass of grains ( in particular the final runout distance ) is not affected by the roughness of the plane , save a slight transformation of the deposit final shape  ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "however , it matches nicely the numerical results , and provides a qualitative explanation for the non linear behaviour of the runout distance with @xmath0 .",
    "finally , it suggests that the key point of the collapse problem lies in the dynamics of ejection of the mass from the initial column itself , rather than in the characteristics of the sideways flow .",

    ", we expect its effects to be more important in a 2d configuration , than in the case of an axisymmetric collapse .",
    "this might be at the origin of the difference is the scaling laws for the runout distance observed in 2d ( or quasi-2d ) and axisymmetric configurations . in the limit of high aspect ratios",
    "however , the mass ejection tends towards the ejection of the totality of the initial mass . in that limit",
    ", differences should no longer be observed between the 2d and the axisymmetric configuration . in any case , our results suggest that an analytical expression of the runout distance should account for the process of the ejection of grains at the bottom of the collapsing column",
    "the runout distance appears to be strongly dependent on the fall dynamics and not only on the effective flow properties , namely effective basal friction in our case .",
    "although high aspect ratios are difficult to find in natural context , many rock falls or slope destabilisations involve a strong acceleration ( and possibly free fall ) , which is a key aspect of the material ejection . in a geophysical perspective",
    ", this suggests that the mobility of a natural flow , usually defined as the ratio of the runout distance to the initial height of the material , is related to the early dynamics of the mass release as well as to the flowing properties of the material .",
    "3 .   since the sideways flow undergoes a simple basal friction dissipation process , its modelling using shallow water approaches is possible , but not straightforward .",
    "indeed , a difficulty lies in the description of the initial conditions represented by the vertical column collapse , which escapes , intrinsically , the shallow water assumptions .",

    "<S> we show that the flow characteristics strongly depend on the early dynamics of the collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new scaling for the runout distance that matches the data well , is compatible with a friction model , and provide a qualitative explanation to the column collapse phenomenology . </S>"
