    "one of the interesting area of research in nuclear physics is the study of symmetries and their violation .",
    "the general goal of the research in this area is to find small but observable effects of charge symmetry violation ( csv ) which might provide significant insight into the dynamics of csv interaction .",
    "csv of the @xmath3 interaction refers to a difference between proton- proton and neutron - neutron interactions only .",
    "it is most clearly manifested in the @xmath4 scattering lengths _ i.e. _ the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering lengths at @xmath7s@xmath8 state is non- zero @xcite",
    ". other convincing evidence of csv comes from the binding energy difference of mirror nuclei which is known as okamoto - nolen - schifer ( ons ) anomaly @xcite .",
    "the modern manifestation of csv includes difference of neutron - proton form factors , hadronic correction to @xmath9 @xcite , the observation of the decay of @xmath10 etc @xcite .",
    "the current understanding of csv is that at the fundamental level , caused by the finite mass difference between up @xmath11 and down @xmath12 quarks @xcite . as a consequence , at the hadronic level , charge symmetry ( cs )",
    "is violated due to non - degenerate mass of nucleons .",
    "there are various mechanisms that can lead to csv in @xmath3 interaction .",
    "for example , neutral mesons with same spin parity with different isospin can mix at the fundamental level due to quark mass difference ( at the hadronic level due to neutron - proton mass splitting ) .",
    "the most important is the @xmath13-@xmath14 mixing , which according to ref .",
    "@xcite is claimed to be successful to explain csv observables .",
    "the other examples are @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath1-@xmath15 mixing @xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite that @xmath1-@xmath15 is important as it is of opposite sign to @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing where individual contribution is known to be small .",
    "in all the previous works , the mixing amplitude is taken to be either constant or on - shall @xcite , which is not consistent for the construction of @xmath3 potential as the mixing amplitude has strong momentum dependence @xcite .",
    "even the @xmath13-@xmath14 mixing amplitude changes sign as one moves away from @xmath16 pole to space - like region .",
    "it is important to note that the mixing amplitude in the space - like region is relevant for the construction of csv potential .",
    "once the mixing amplitude is known , one can construct csv potential by evaluating two body @xmath3 scattering diagram involving mixed intermediate states like @xmath1-@xmath2 or @xmath13-@xmath14 .",
    "it is to be noted that external legs can also contribute to the csv if one incorporates relativistic corrections as has recently been shown in ref.@xcite .    in matter",
    ", there can be another source of symmetry breaking if the ground state contains unequal number of neutrons ( @xmath17 ) and protons ( @xmath18 ) giving rise to ground state induced mixing of various charged states like @xmath13-@xmath14 , @xmath1-@xmath2 etc .",
    "meson even in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the matter induced mixing was studied in @xcite . but none of these deal with the construction of two - body potential except @xcite where density dependent csv potential has been constructed considering only the effect of the scalar mean field on the nucleon mass excluding the possibility of matter driven mixing .",
    "recently , the medium dependent csv potential due to @xmath13-@xmath14 mixing has been constructed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is also to be noted that such mixing amplitudes , in asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) , have non - zero contribution even if the quark or nucleon masses are taken to be equal @xcite .",
    "we consider both of these mechanisms to construct csv @xmath3 potential due to @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing .",
    "although the vacuum contribution of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing to csv has been shown to be negligible as compared to @xmath13-@xmath14 mixing , we , in this work , explore the role of medium dependent @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude in constructing the csv potential taking into account the contribution of external legs .    physically , in dense system , intermediate mesons might be absorbed and re - emitted from the fermi spheres .",
    "in symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) the emission and absorption involving different isospin states like @xmath1 and @xmath2 cancel when the contributions of both the proton and neutron fermi spheres are added provided the nucleon masses are taken to be equal . in anm , on the other hand , the unbalanced contributions coming from the scattering of neutron and proton fermi spheres , lead to the mixing which depends both on the density @xmath20 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath21 $ ] . inclusion of this process is depicted by the third diagram in fig.[fig02 ] .",
    "we present the formalism in sec.ii where the three momentum dependent @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude is calculated to construct the csv potential in matter .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in sec.iii .",
    "finally , in sec.iv , we summarise our results .",
