    "spectral or modal analysis is an essential tool to deal with resonance phenomena in optics  or wave physics in general  since it provides the natural excitation conditions of the system . in optics , metallic structures",
    "are of particular interest , since they support a vast variety of resonances , resulting from plasmon and geometric structuration .",
    "these resonances are defined as the eigenfrequencies and corresponding eigenmodes associated with the spectral problem of source free maxwell s equations .",
    "metallic structures are classically described by frequency dependent permittivity given by drude or drude - lorentz models @xcite . in this situation",
    "the operator involved in the spectral problem of maxwell s equations depends on the frequency as well as the material dispersion relation .",
    "the spectral problem becomes non linear , and generally non - hermitian when dissipation takes place .",
    "hence the eigenfrequencies lie in the complex plane and the computation of the whole spectrum of resonances is a challenging task",
    ".    numerical calculation of the complex resonances has been performed for two dimensional photonic crystals in the cases of square @xcite and circular @xcite rods .",
    "these pioneering calculations have been performed using numerical codes solving time - harmonic maxwell s equations combined with a _ poles search _ algorithm in the complex plane , making the tool difficult to use in practice . hence , new techniques have been proposed and used to determine the complex resonances .",
    "for instance , as for photonic crystals , generalizations of the well - known plane wave expansion method have been implemented @xcite . in the case of monotonic dispersion relation , _",
    "e.g. _ away from the materials intrinsic resonances , the cutting plane method as proven to be an effective numerical work - around @xcite .",
    "finally , finite difference schemes based on the yee grid have been proposed in @xcite or @xcite . in this last reference ,",
    "the technique is based on the introduction of additional fields leading to an extended system where the frequency dispersion is eliminated , which represents a decisive advantage for numerical calculations .",
    "this framework appears to be a derivation of the auxiliary field formalism introduced by a. tip @xcite in order to consider rigorously maxwell s equations with frequency dispersion and absorption .",
    "indeed , in this formalism , auxiliary fields are added to the electromagnetic field to express maxwell s equations with an hermitian operator independent of time .",
    "thus , the auxiliary field formalism @xcite is the general frame leading to the rigorous treatment of absorption and to significant simplification of frequency dispersion .    in this article , a version of the auxiliary field formalism",
    "is established in order to allow the linearization of the spectral problem associated with frequency dispersive materials described by drude or drude - lorentz model . a variational form of the resulting augmented system is derived and is then implemented into the finite element method ( fem ) .",
    "next , the presented method is compared to semi - analytical results for two dimensional multi - domain closed cavities .",
    "finally , the method is successfully applied to two - dimensional photonic crystals made of drude materials and the fully exhibited richness of the obtained complex spectrum of resonances is discussed .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the unit vectors of the orthogonal cartesian coordinate system @xmath2 and @xmath3 the coordinates of the vector @xmath4 .",
    "the time - harmonic regime is considered with a @xmath5 time dependence , where @xmath6 is the possibly complex valued frequency . the electromagnetic field",
    "is represented by the complex amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the time dependency is then omitted ) . in the case of two - dimensional structures , @xmath4 reduces to @xmath9 and the fields do not depend on the @xmath10 variable : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the considered domain , a closed subset of @xmath14 of boundary @xmath15 .",
    "the domain @xmath13 can be constituted of several sub - domains @xmath16 of boundary @xmath17 such that @xmath18 . for each @xmath19 ,",

    "each sub - domain is made of a linear , possibly graded - index , isotropic , and non - magnetic material .",
    "the materials are assumed to be electrically frequency dispersive and dissipative .",
    "the tensor fields of relative complex permittivity @xmath22 in each sub - domain @xmath19 are @xmath23 and the relative permittivity @xmath24 of the total structure can be written : @xmath25 it is assumed that the frequency dependence of each @xmath26 can be modelled by : @xmath27 which corresponds to a superposition of lorentz resonances @xcite .",
    "this model is known to be particularly relevant to the describe the permittivity of metals in the visible range @xcite .",
    "note that these functions of @xmath6 are analytic in the upper half plane of complex frequencies and hence satisfy the causality requirement .",
    "it is stressed that purely dispersive causal systems ( without absorption ) can be tackled by setting the damping constant @xmath28 to 0 .",
    "finally , a pure drude contribution is obtained for @xmath29 .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to perform the spectral analysis of the maxwell s equations which is based on the calculation of the eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors of the source free equations : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the vacuum permeability and permittivity .",
    "these equations can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 here @xmath6 appears clearly as the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath36 with its associated eigenvector @xmath37 . as already mentioned , in presence of dispersion , this eigenvalue problem ( evp ) is non - linear in frequency since @xmath36 depends on @xmath6 .",
    "when in addition absorption takes place , this operator @xmath36 is also non - hermitian , which requires a numerical computation in the plane of complex frequencies .",
    "the auxiliary fields formalism has been introduced and developed by a. tip since 1997 @xcite .",
    "it is based on the adjunction of auxiliary fields to the classical electromagnetic field that leads to the construction of the unique hermitian extension @xcite of the maxwell s operator which is linear in frequency . in this paper , the purely dispersive case introduced in @xcite is extended to drude - lorentz resonances with absorption , see eq .",

    ", the precision of the results is affected by the presence of these spurious modes and the accuracy of the fem results is degraded in a neighborhood of @xmath107 , which probably has overlap with the branch of surface plasmon modes around @xmath108 ( cf fig .",

    "finally the connection between the two bands 4 and 5 observed in the previous figures is discussed .",
    "first , it is stressed that the resonances corresponding the brillouin contour ( i.e. the contour of the reduced brillouin zone ) describe some deformed triangles which do not contain all the resonances corresponding to the whole reduced brillouin zone .",
    "hence the description of the solely brillouin contour does not provide all the information of the system : in particular , the critical point highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] is precisely located in the inner of the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "[ fig11 ] proposes a representation of a band interlaced with a second one , as occurs for band 4 with band 5 .",
    "this representation shows that the set of resonances corresponding to the brillouin contour is not a closed path , but a deformed triangle with a cut and a segment .",
    "this cut in the deformed triangle defines two branches starting from the critical point defined above .",
    "hence the inside of the brillouin zone contains two critical points and two branches which may have particular properties .",
    "this observation supports the relevance of a scan of the whole reduced brillouin zone for some systems .",
    "next , it is stressed that the interlacing of bands 4 and 5 may be interpreted as a coupling effect . in this case",
    ", it can be expected that the coupling of the two modes with the same frequency @xmath6 and wavevector @xmath116 results from a symmetry which has been broken . in the present photonic crystal ,",
    "no spatial symmetry is broken . however , in the drude model ( [ drude ] ) , the resonances of the permittivity have not the same imaginary part with a first resonance at @xmath139 and a second at @xmath140 .",
    "hence , one can imagine that this could break some symmetry in the time domain since other models for permittivity are generally made by couple of resonances @xmath141 ( with both @xmath142 and @xmath143 real ) with the same imaginary part .",
    "such assumption is consistent with the interlacing observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectre3 ] and [ fig : zoom ] which is essentially in the vertical ( imaginary ) direction in order to connect a low absorption band to a high absorption band .",
    "this assumption can been checked by considering the resonances in the same crystal with square rods but with the permittivity now given by the drude - lorentz model ( [ ep2 ] ) with the parameters @xmath144 the corresponding spectrum of resonances represented on fig . [",
    "fig : lorentz ] shows that the bands remain enlaced .",
    "hence we conclude that the interlacing of bands is not produced by a broken symmetry in this kind of situation : further investigations are needed in a future work to understand this phenomenon .",
    "the same numerical calculations have been performed for p - polarization with drude parameters given by ( [ epsdrude ] ) and ( [ paramdrude ] ) . in this case",
    "only the photonic crystal of circular rods is considered in order to compare the results to the one of the literature @xcite .",
    "[ fig : polarppc ] presents the whole spectrum of complex resonances .",
    "the results are in agreement with the ones in the literature @xcite , except for the presence of spurious modes as previously observed for closed cavities in sec .  3 .",
    "these spurious modes affect the results around the complex frequency @xmath145 where @xmath146 . notice that these spurious modes are mostly located on a vertical axis starting from the vanishing frequency @xmath107 ( red line on fig .",
    "[ fig : polarppc ] ) .",
    "in addition , the presence of spurious modes is observed at high frequencies ( yellow circle on fig .",
    "[ fig : polarppc ] ) .",
    "the presence of these additional modes can be explained by the difficulty to describe the high frequency regime , especially in this p - polarization case which more demanding for the coarse mesh and the choice of edge elements .",
    "this preliminary implementation in p - polarization needs further development which will be presented in a future work .",
    "in this paper , the so - called `` resonance formalism '' has been implemented into the finite element method in order to perform modal analysis of dispersive and dissipative photonic structures .",

    "the numerical results obtained in s - polarization are in excellent agreement with previous results in the literature and obtained with completely different numerical methods . as to results obtained in p - polarization , they suffer from the presence of spurious modes which , in the case of the used fem method , can be explained by the non - fulfillment of the divergence condition when the permittivity vanishes",
    ".    for s - polarization , the numerical method presented in this paper provides an efficient tool to compute and analyze the complex spectrum of dispersive systems and non self - adjoint operators which have been rarely explored .",
    "the present results confirm that retrieving the resonances for wavevectors corresponding to the boundary of the first reduced brillouin zone is not sufficient to catch the whole spectrum of photonic crystals .",
    "in particular , the presence of critical points and branches have been highlighted in the inside of the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "also , it has been shown that the phenomenon of resonances outgoing of the contour is associated to an interlacing of bands .",
    "however , no argument has been found to explain this interlacing of bands , particularly a coupling of modes could not be evidenced .",
    "in addition to this band interlacing , cusps and loops have been highlighted in the band structure , which could have interesting effect on the group velocity .",
    "further developments of the present method are required to be applied on open - systems and 3d structures . regarding open - systems ,",
    "the solution is to use perfectly matched layer damping the field in free space @xcite . for 3d systems ,",
    "a solution to avoid spurious modes while using edge elements in the fem has to be developed .",
