    "it is now well established that the dominant mass fraction of our universe consists of some yet - unknown form of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "well - motivated models predict dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )  @xcite for which searches can be conducted in direct scattering experiments located on earth . in such experiments",
    ", wimps are expected to induce nuclear recoils with a roughly exponentially falling spectrum that extends to at most a few tens of kev in energy  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the dominant background is usually composed of electronic recoils from @xmath2- or @xmath3-radiation .",
    "most direct dark matter search experiments are able to discriminate nuclear recoils from electronic recoils based on some discrimination parameter , such as the ratio of ionization to phonon signal  @xcite , scintillation to phonon signal  @xcite , ionization to scintillation signal  @xcite , or the pulse shape of the scintillation light  @xcite . in a plot of this discrimination parameter as function of energy , the signal and background events thus separate .",
    "typically , a signal acceptance area is defined a priori in this parameter space .",
    "only events that fall within this area are considered as wimp candidate events for the interpretation of the result in terms of a dark matter detection , or for the calculation of limits on the wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section .",
    "such a hard cut has some obvious disadvantages .",
    "most importantly , the particular location of the signal candidate events within the signal acceptance area is not taken into account .",
    "in general , the expected signal and background will follow a different spectrum , which is utilized by the maximum - gap and optimum - interval methods  @xcite , a frequentist approach to calculate limits .",
    "the generalization to two dimensions , the maximum - patch method  @xcite , extends this feature to the case where background leaks into the signal acceptance region from high or low discrimination parameters .",
    "an intrinsic advantage of these methods is that the resulting limit is robust against small changes of the signal acceptance region , and they are widely used in discriminating direct dark matter searches today .",
    "however , these methods also have some severe drawbacks : they are designed to always result in an upper limit , and a natural transition to a claim of detection , as for example inherent to the feldman - cousins - approach  @xcite , is not possible .",
    "in addition , systematic uncertainties are not taken into account .",
    "thus , the resulting limit can be quoted at a given statistical confidence level  ( cl ) , typically taken to be 90% , but systematic uncertainties need to be treated separately .    in this paper , we present an approach that overcomes both of these problems of the conventional treatment of data from direct dark matter detection experiments . as a practical example , we use data from the first dark matter results of the xenon100 experiment  @xcite .",
    "this data was previously analyzed in the classical way , by pre - defining a signal acceptance region based on calibration data . in particular , this region was defined using the prompt scintillation signal as a measurement of recoil energy , in the range between 4 - 20  photoelectrons  ( pe ) . in energy , this corresponds to about @xmath4 ( kev nuclear recoil ) , depending on the energy calibration through the assumed relative scintillation efficiency @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the logarithm of the ratio of proportional scintillation , @xmath6 , to prompt scintillation , @xmath7 , was taken as a discrimination parameter  @xcite , and the signal acceptance region was defined below the median of the nuclear recoil band , as measured with a @xmath8ambe  neutron calibration .",
    "the electronic recoil discrimination in this signal acceptance region was determined to be larger than 99% based on calibration data from compton - scattered @xmath9co gammas . using 11.17  live days of data",
    ", no events were observed in the signal acceptance region .",
    "thus , upper limits on the wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section were derived , based on zero observed events .",
    "two separate limit curves were calculated for two different parameterizations of @xmath5 in the low - energy region where measurements are lacking or are uncertain  @xcite .    here , we re - analyze this data with the profile likelihood ratio statistical approach  @xcite , that is inherent to the minos package commonly used with the minuit software  @xcite .",
    "this method relies on the assumption that one can properly model the background via calibration measurements or monte carlo simulations , as opposed to the yellin methods  @xcite , where no information on the background is assumed .",
    "this increases the sensitivity of the method at the price of being less robust against systematic uncertainties on the background .",
    "however , by incorporating systematic uncertainties into the model , one can adjust the trade - off between sensitivity and robustness to the level desired by the experimentalist . in any case ,",
    "understanding of the background is of course essential to any method that is used to quantify the significance of a discovery claim . the particular profile likelihood model used here is presented in section  [ sec : pl ] .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath5 , that can serve as an example for systematic uncertainties related to the detector , are treated in section  [ sec : leff ] , together with systematic uncertainties from the escape velocity @xmath10 as an example for astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "calibration data for both the electronic recoil background as well as the nuclear recoil signal are taken as constraining control measurements .",
    "these constrain the full likelihood model , which is constructed in section  [ sec : control ] .",
    "the sensitivity of the experiment is calculated , based solely on this model , in section  [ sec : exclusion ] .",
    "taking the actual measurement into account , the resulting exclusion curve is derived also in section  [ sec : exclusion ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "events recorded by the xenon100 detector can be characterized by their prompt and proportional scintillation signals , and are therefore treated in this analysis as a set of points in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "the distribution of signal events in @xmath7 can be predicted from theoretical models taking into account the detector response , as will be described below .",
    "the joint distribution in @xmath7 and @xmath6 , for signal and background events , is estimated from the calibration measurements .",
    "the current measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath10 are similarly treated as another set of control measurements .",
    "the statistical model describing the outcome of the measurements thus includes a number of unknown quantities , i.e. _ nuisance parameters_. those are the expected number of background events @xmath12 given the exposure and the @xmath11 parameter range in question , a set of probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 describing the distribution of signal and background events in the @xmath11 plane , the relative scintillation efficiency @xmath5 , as well as the escape velocity @xmath10 . the full likelihood function @xmath15 , for a given wimp mass @xmath16 and cross - section @xmath17 ,",
    "is written as a product of five terms :    @xmath18    the first term @xmath19 describes the main measurement of the xenon100 detector , while the following terms describe the subsidiary measurements that are used to constrain the nuisance parameters in the main likelihood term @xmath19 .",
    "the precise definition of these terms will be given in the following sections .",
    "additional uncertainties can easily be incorporated by adding additional likelihood terms , but are not relevant for the data set analyzed here .",
    "the signal cross - section @xmath17 is the one parameter of interest .",
    "all other parameters are nuisance parameters which are _ profiled out _ with a profile likelihood ratio , as explained below ( equation  [ eq : pl2 ] ) .",
    "we follow the procedure of a hypothesis test based on the profile likelihood ratio  @xcite .",
    "this technique can be used both to exclude a wimp with a specific mass and cross - section , or to establish the significance of a discovery .",
    "a test statistic @xmath20 reduces the observed data to only one value and is constructed in order to test the signal hypothesis @xmath21 .",
    "it is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) of @xmath17 , i.e. the value of @xmath17 that maximizes the likelihood equation  [ eq : likelihood ] .",
    "@xmath24 is the profile likelihood ratio and is given by @xmath25 the double - hat parameters in the numerator are the conditional mles of the nuisance parameters when the signal cross - section is fixed to a given value @xmath17 .",
    "the ` single - hat ' parameters in the denominator are the mles of all parameters allowing also @xmath17 to vary . by construction , @xmath26 , hence @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath20 equals zero when the best - fit value of the cross - section ( @xmath23 ) equals the hypothesized value ( @xmath17 ) , which corresponds to the most signal - like outcome .",
    "larger values of the test statistic @xmath20 indicate that the data are less compatible with the signal hypothesis @xmath21 .",
    "since we are concerned with calculating a one - sided upper bound , we only consider outcomes with @xmath28 as an evidence against the signal hypothesis and set @xmath20 to zero otherwise .",
    "let @xmath29 be the probability distribution function of the test statistic @xmath20 under the signal hypothesis @xmath21 , and let @xmath30 be the value of the test statistic obtained with the observed data .",
    "the signal @xmath31-value @xmath32 , is the probability that the outcome of a hypothetical , random xenon100 experiment results in a test statistic larger ( less signal - like ) than the observed one , when the signal hypothesis @xmath21 is _ true_. therefore , @xmath32 given by @xmath33 the signal hypothesis @xmath21 is rejected at 90%  cl if @xmath34 .",
    "downward fluctuations of the background might lead to exclusions of very small cross - sections to which the experiment is not sensitive . to protect against such an effect , @xmath32 is modified  @xcite to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the probability of the test statistic @xmath20 to be larger than the observed one under the background - only hypothesis @xmath37 .",
    "other protection procedures would also be conceivable , but this particular extension has a conservative over - coverage nature",
    ". it has been verified by monte carlo simulations that the coverage of our claimed 90%  cl upper bound on the cross - section is in the range ( 92 - 95)% and thus larger than 90% , in accordance with the conservative nature of the method .",
    "the upper limit @xmath38 on the cross - section @xmath17 for a given wimp mass @xmath16 is found by solving @xmath39    wilks theorem  @xcite states that @xmath20 follows a chi - square distribution in the limit of a large number of observations , which in this context not only includes the observed wimp candidate events , but also all of the control measurements .",
    "it has been verified by monte carlo simulations that this asymptotic behavior indeed describes the distribution of the test statistic to a good approximation .",
    "we therefore use the chi - square approximation in order to estimate the signal @xmath31-value @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath40 is estimated from monte carlo simulations of background only events .",
    "we can also use the above statistical method in a natural way to quantify the significance of a possible additional event population or signal discovery . to this end",
    ", we test the background - only hypothesis ( @xmath41 ) , and try to reject it . similar to equation  [ eq : pl1 ] ,",
    "the discovery test statistic @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 setting @xmath41 in equation  [ eq : pl2 ] yields @xmath44 the @xmath31-value is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the probability density function of @xmath42 under the background - only hypothesis @xmath47 .",
    "a @xmath31-value of @xmath48 corresponds to a 3@xmath17 signal evidence .",
    "following wilks theorem , @xmath42 asymptotically distributes as a chi - square distribution under the background - only hypothesis . under wilks theorem ,",
    "the discovery significance is given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "as a general remark , the profile likelihood can result in the discovery of a process that looks like the signal hypothesis .",
    "however , the interpretation of the physical origin of such a signal is of course left to scientific discourse .",
    "the relative scintillation efficiency @xmath5 is the largest systematic uncertainty for the data analyzed here .",
    "it relates the expected number of @xmath7 photoelectrons to the recoil energy @xmath51 .",
    "the recoil energy dependence of @xmath5 together with its uncertainty are taken from a gaussian fit of all available direct measurements  @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : leff ] . to extrapolate below @xmath52 , where there are no available measurements of @xmath5 yet , the 68% confidence interval for @xmath5",
    "is constructed such that it follows the two different extrapolations used in  @xcite to facilitate the comparison of the resulting limit .",
    "we emphasize that this extrapolation follows both the new data published in  @xcite , the theoretical expectations spelled out in  @xcite , as well as the trend expected from simulations  @xcite .",
    "@xcite together with a gaussian fit ( solid blue line ) and the uncertainty band indicating the @xmath53 and @xmath54 regions ( shaded dark and light blue , respectively ) .",
    "]    we parametrize the uncertainty of @xmath5 with a single nuisance parameter @xmath55 , which is defined to be normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance .",

    "this simply reflects the fact that in  @xcite , only half of the available parameter space ( 50% nuclear recoil acceptance ) was defined a priori as the signal acceptance region .",
    "in contrast , the current analysis considers the full available discrimination parameter space , also taking the background in each band @xmath92 into account . since there are no events observed in the data even in the @xmath111 region above the nuclear recoil median ( see figure  3 in  @xcite ) , the limit improves accordingly .",

    "the limit obtained here is more stringent than the limit shown in  @xcite , constraining the areas favored by cogent  @xcite and dama  @xcite .",
    "this comes from our definition of the uncertainty bands of @xmath5 as shown in figure  [ fig : leff ] , where we set the @xmath111 interval to equal the two extrapolations used in the previous analysis .",
    "we emphasize that here we do not assume any specific behavior of @xmath5 , but rather consider it as an unknown quantity with the appropriate measurement uncertainty , as described in section  [ sec : leff ] .",
    "such systematic uncertainty is incorporated in a natural way in the calculation of the limit and results in a single limit at 90%  cl , including all considered uncertainties .",
    "we have introduced and applied the frequentist statistical method based on the profile likelihood test statistic to re - analyze the first data release from the xenon100 direct dark matter search experiment .",
    "this method avoids the need to a priori define a signal acceptance region , but instead takes all measured data into account .",
    "the background was estimated using calibration data as control measurements .",
    "uncertainties in the relative scintillation efficiency @xmath5 and the galactic escape velocity @xmath123 were taken into account in the construction of the likelihood model .",
    "using the profile likelihood test statistic allows to calculate the sensitivity of the experiment with its uncertainty bands , and to set a well - defined single limit , taking all systematic uncertainties into account . applying the method to the previously published xenon100 data results in an improvement of the limit over a wide wimp mass range , with a minimum @xmath124 for wimps with mass @xmath125 .",
