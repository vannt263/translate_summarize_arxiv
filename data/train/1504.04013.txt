    "bars are a common feature of spiral galaxies , with near - ir imaging revealing that the majority have some bar structure in their central regions , while strong bars are seen in about one - third of spirals @xcite .",
    "they represent the most spectacular example of the complex interplay between stellar and gas kinematics in disk galaxies .",
    "they have been implicated in a wide range of evolutionary processes in galaxies , due principally to their being the strongest violation of axial symmetry in otherwise quiescent galaxies .",
    "this leads to strong gravitational torques , with consequent changes in the angular momentum of gas and stars that can drive rapid radial motion of material .",
    "thus , bars have been implicated in radial migration and mixing of stars and gas in the outer disk , gas supply to central black holes to fuel agn activity , and wholesale transport of material from disks to bulges , with ( presumed ) global increases in global star formation rates , causing ` secular ' morphological evolution @xcite on timescales of a few gyr .",
    "much of the debate relating bars and star formation has concerned the evidence linking strong bars to the increases in the global star formation rate compared with unbarred galaxies with otherwise similar properties .",
    "some studies have found evidence for such a link , with the early study of @xcite being confirmed by work using iras - based measurements of global star formation rates , e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , this paper will focus on a little - discussed aspect of bars , which is their ability , in specific but important environments , to _ suppress _ star formation .",
    "this suppression was pointed out by @xcite , and explored observationally by the present authors in @xcite , where we noted several strongly - barred galaxies that had strong dips in their radial h@xmath0 line emission profiles , in the radial range where their unbarred counterparts hosted their strongest star formation activity . in this paper , we explore this result in more detail using long - slit spectroscopy , and use these galaxies as probes of possible sources of line emission other than star formation , including ` liner - type ' emission and h@xmath0 emission from diffuse interstellar gas ( dig ) .",

    "note the pronounced dip in the sbb profiles , end that the radial range of this dip corresponds to the peak in the line emission of unbarred galaxies.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ]    the initial motivation for the present study came from an analysis of the star formation properties of @xmath1 200 barred and unbarred disk galaxies @xcite using h@xmath0 imaging data from the h@xmath0gs survey @xcite .",
    "part of this analysis looked at the radial profiles of h@xmath2 [ nii ] emission , averaged over all galaxies of a given hubble type .",
    "this analysis uncovered a characteristic pattern in the sbb galaxies ( and to some extent in sbbc and sbc galaxies ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : haprof_bar ] .",
    "the upper frame in this figure shows the average radial h@xmath0 profile for * all * sbb galaxies in the h@xmath0gs sample , with no other imposed selection criteria .",
    "the vertical axis is the fraction of the total galaxy - wide emission - line flux contributed by annular regions ; the horizontal axis is the radial size of each annular region , which is normalised by the @xmath3-band 24  mag./sq.arcsec isophotal radius of the galaxy , r@xmath4 , prior to averaging .",
    "note that the values are _ not _ normalised by the area of each annulus , and hence differ from more frequently used surface brightness profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : haprof_bar ] ( upper frame ) shows a characteristic dip in sf at intermediate radii .",
    "figure [ fig : n2712r_ha ] shows an example of one of the galaxies contributing to the mean sbb h@xmath0 profile , where the images shown are the @xmath3-band light in the upper frame , and continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 ( including the surrounding [ nii ] lines ) in the lower .",
    "this illustrates clearly the reason for these distinctive profiles in the barred galaxies ; the narrow - band h@xmath0 image shows strong emission both in a central peak , and within a ring lying just outside the ends of the bar ( the bar itself is evident in the @xmath3-band image , but not in line emission ) . between these",
    "lies a region swept out by the bar which has greatly suppressed line emission , but that shows significant continuum emission in the @xmath3-band , which we have termed the ` star formation desert ' , which will be abbreviated henceforth as ` sfd ' where appropriate .",

    "this is shown in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : haprof_bar ] , which is calculated in exactly the same way as the upper frame , but for galaxies classified as being unbarred . here",
    "all galaxies of types sab , sb and sbc have been included to give comparable numbers to the sbb profile , but otherwise no selection has been imposed in making this unbarred profile .",
    "the most interesting point in this comparison is that the ` desert ' region in the sbb profiles matches very closely with the radial range ( 0.20.4 times the r@xmath4 isophotal radius ) that makes the strongest contribution to the total star - formation activity in the unbarred galaxies .",
    "contrary to a popular view , the strong bulges of sa - type galaxies are not elliptical - galaxy like regions , devoid of sf .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , we showed that s0a and sa galaxies had the most centrally - concentrated star formation of all spiral types , although the overall star formation rate per unit stellar is lower than in later - type spiral galaxies .",
    "so , these sf desert regions provide an unusually clean window to study the central few kpc of bright spiral galaxies , uncontaminated by emission lines from hii regions .",
    "[ fig : haprof_bar ] ( upper frame ) shows that the dip in the mean emission line profile for sbb galaxies does not fall to zero emission - line flux , raising the question of how completely the bars suppress star formation ; is this an artefact of averaging over multiple galaxy profiles , is there residual star formation in some or all of these barred galaxies , or is there some other explanation , unrelated to star formation , for this residual flux in these regions ?",
    "this is one of several questions addressed in the present paper .      in the context of the current paper , it is important to consider other possible sources of emission lines , apart from star formation . in the central region ,",
    "agn - type emission can dominate , powered by activity associated with a central super - massive black hole .",
    "this type of emission is generally quite cleanly distinguished from that associated with star formation , both by its spatial distribution , and by the very different line ratios resulting from the much harder ionising spectrum from agn , resulting in line ratio diagnostics pioneered by @xcite .",
    "more problematic , and interesting from the perspective of the current paper , is the ` liner ' ( for ` low ionization nuclear emission - line regions ' ) emission , first studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "this emission has characteristically strong emission lines from low - ionisation states , including [ oii]@xmath63727 , [ oi]@xmath66300 , [ nii]@xmath66548 & 6584 and [ sii]@xmath66717 & 6731 , relative to the balmer emission lines including h@xmath0 @xmath6 6563 and h@xmath7 @xmath64861 . @xcite interpreted the liners as a low - luminosity extrapolation of agn , and this interpretation was explored in more detail by @xcite , who modeled the line emission in these systems as shock - excited gas , powered either by agn jets or accretion - driven flows .",
    "however , @xcite conclude , from a population synthesis study of @xmath810@xmath9 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , that the majority of those showing liner - type emission can be explained through purely stellar emission , on the assumption that these are post - starburst galaxies , termed ` retired ' galaxies by @xcite .",
    "other evidence for diffuse emission lines is found in the analysis of 11 spiral galaxies within 10  mpc by @xcite . after excluding the emission from discrete regions of h@xmath0 @xmath10 [ nii ] emission ,",
    "typically 45% of the total remains as a diffuse component , which they conclude is partially , but not completely , explained by the leakage of ionising photons from hii regions .    in a recent study ,",
    "@xcite find liner - type emission over the central 4  kpc region of the strongly - barred nearby sbb galaxy ngc  5850 .",
    "they follow @xcite in ascribing this emission to a purely stellar origin , and particularly post - asymptotic giant branch ( p - agb ) stars .",
    "however , ngc  5850 may have recently had a high - velocity encounter with the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc  5846 @xcite raising the possibility that shock excitation may also be involved .",
    "thus , the major questions addressed in the present paper are as follows : +    * are the apparent ` desert ' regions seen in narrow - band imaging completely devoid of line emission ? * if weak lines are found , are the line ratios consistent with star formation , liner - type emission , or a combination of the two ?",
    "* does line emission correlate in intensity with the surface brightness of the underlying stellar population , as expected for lines resulting from an evolved stellar population ( e.g. p - agb stars ) ? * are the velocities of any lines consistent with their coming from a rotating disk population ?",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the main properties of the observed galaxy sample are introduced , and the spectroscopic observations and their reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 includes the main results in terms of emission line detections , the comparison of line ratios from ` desert ' and star formation regions , and a brief discussion of the kinematics of the detected emission .",
    "section 4 presents a discussion of the interpretation of the observations in terms of the likely origin of the line emission .",
    "the main conclusions are then summarised in section 5 .    throughout the paper , galaxy distances",
    "are calculated assuming a hubble constant of 68  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 @xcite and the virgo - infall - only model from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , for galaxies with recession velocities greater than 2000  km  s@xmath11 . below this limit , values based on redshift - independent distance indicators ( e.g. cepheids or type ia supernovae ) , also taken from ned , were used .",
    "observations are presented here for 15 low - redshift barred spiral galaxies .",
    "the sample is not in any sense claimed to be a complete or statistically representative sample of galaxies , with the main criterion for selection being that we have narrow - band h@xmath0 imaging which shows evidence for a clear ` desert ' over a radial range corresponding to a clearly visible bar .",
    "note that the evidence for a bar comes from broad - band imaging , as bars themselves are generally not visible in h@xmath0 imaging , as shown in fig .",

    "all of these galaxies except ugc  3685 are within the footprint of the sdss , and seven have nuclear spectral data from sdss enabling classifications of the dominant nuclear ionisation source using the methods of @xcite .",

    "most of the observations presented here were taken between the 4th and 8th february 2014 , using the r1200y grating , the red@xmath102 ccd detector and a 1.5@xmath5 slit .",

    "the slit angle was generally chosen so as to maximise the area of star formation desert region contained within the slit and thus was not , in general , at the parallactic angle . however , atmospheric refraction effects are not a problem for the present study since the only line ratios we are interested in are h@xmath0 and the surrounding [ nii ] lines , which cover a very small wavelength range making differential refraction negligible .",

    "spectrophotometric standards taken from the isaac newton group list ( available at http://catserver.ing.iac.es/landscape/tn065-100/workflux.php ) were observed on all nights at a range of airmasses to enable flux calibration .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>,>,>,>,>,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     [ tab : rot_vel ]    this analysis makes clear that the line emission from the two star formation desert regions shares fully in the rotational velocity of the disk of ngc  2712 . in one case , sfd1 to the north of the nucleus ,",
    "the rotation is @xmath120  km  s@xmath11 slower than that of the hii region lying just outside it ; but in sfd2 , south of the nucleus , the pattern is reversed , and in any case most rotation curves show fluctuations of at least @xmath1420  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "so it is clear that whatever drives the sfd line emission , it is linked to the rotating disk component .",
    "we next perform a simple test motivated by the possibility that the diffuse line emission is causally linked to the old stellar population present in the sfd regions , for example if the emission is due to p - agb stars .",
    "if this is the case , there should be a correlation between the strength of the diffuse line emission and the continuum surface brightness in the same regions , since the latter can most plausibly be assumed to be due to the old stellar population , in the absence of ongoing or recent star formation .",
    "figures  [ fig : ha_sb_v_cont ] and [ fig : nii_sb_v_cont ] illustrate a simple test of this possibility , where line surface brightness in w  m@xmath15 sq .",
    "arcsec@xmath11 in the h@xmath0 and [ nii ] lines respectively are plotted against the red - light continuum flux measured from the same spectra , in w m@xmath15 @xmath11 sq . arcsec@xmath11 .",

    "respectively.,width=245 ]      given that we have identified near - ubiquitous diffuse line emission , it is of interest to investigate how significant this component is relative to the global emission - line activity of the galaxies in which it occurs .",
    "for example , it would be useful to know what fraction of the total galaxy line flux , when imaged in a narrow - band filter , would be contributed by this diffuse component . to address this question ,",
    "we have estimated the line fluxes integrated over these areas based on an estimated total h@xmath2 [ nii ] line flux . to simulate narrow - band filter observations ,",
    "this total comprised the sum of the h@xmath0 line flux , without correction for absorption , and the [ nii ] 6584    flux multiplied by a factor @xmath17 to account for the weaker [ nii ] line at 6548   , following the [ nii ] line ratios estimated by @xcite .",
    "the individual galaxy surface brightnesses were then integrated over the sfd areas of their galaxies in arcsec@xmath18 , and converted into star formation rates in units of solar masses per year , using the conversion formula of @xcite , giving a mean of 0.0408 and a median of 0.0327  m@xmath19  yr@xmath11 over the 15 galaxies . to be clear",
    ", we only calculate these numbers for comparison purposes , and do not consider that ionisation by young stars is a likely explanation for this emission .",
    "the numbers presented have not been corrected for any internal extinction ; using the correction preferred by @xcite for bright spiral galaxies would increase these rates by a factor 2.8 , but it is far from clear that these sfd regions contain significant amounts of dust .    in any case , only one conclusion can be drawn from these equivalent star formation rates ; the diffuse line emission we find in these barred galaxies is not a major contributor to the global line emission from these galaxies .",
    "the total inferred sf rates can be compared with global rates derived from narrow - band imaging for 7 of the present sample in @xcite , which have a mean value of 2.02  m@xmath19yr@xmath11 .",
    "so the diffuse emission from the sfd regions only comprises a few per cent of the total emission in these lines from these bright barred galaxies .",
    "future observations are planned to explore this conclusion further in different types of galaxies .",
    "in the analysis presented in this paper , we have used new spectroscopic data to investigate a region that is characteristic of a large fraction of strongly barred galaxies , which we have dubbed the star formation desert or sfd . in earlier papers",
    ", we claimed that this region , which covers the radial range swept out by the bar , is devoid of line emission and hence star formation .",
    "using more sensitive long - slit spectroscopy , we have shown in the present paper that the first of these claims was incorrect , and in fact almost all of the sfd regions have detectable h@xmath0 and [ nii ] emission .",
    "however , this emission is diffuse and at a low surface brightness which accounts for its non - detection in previous narrow - band imaging studies .",
    "the second claim appears to be correct , in that the emission line ratios appear to be inconsistent with those expected for star formation , with the [ nii ] line being relatively much stronger than is found in any star formation regions in this study , or indeed in the very extensive previous literature in this area .",
    "we have put some additional constraints on the processes driving the diffuse line emission by the observation that the emission co - rotates at a rate that is closely coupled with the stellar disk , which argues against this being a very extended warm diffuse halo component , or shocked infalling or outflowing gas @xcite .",
    "the strength of the emission in both h@xmath0 and [ nii ] correlates strongly with the strength of the underlying stellar continuum , which favours a link with p - agb stars , which have been proposed in several previous studies as a source of diffuse line emission in normal , and particularly early - type galaxies with little or no star formation , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we note that agn do not seem a likely source of this emission , since many of the 15 galaxies have no indications of agn activity . in columns 3 and 4 of table  [",
    "tab : gals_obs ] , 7 are listed as having agn , liner or composite nuclei , 4 are dominated by star formation and the remaining 4 have no specific nuclear classifications . in any case the emission is observed over several kpc which would argue against a single central ionising source . given the extent of the sfd regions , leakage of ionising photons from hii regions also seems to be ruled out .",
    "however , there are some other intriguing possibilities for extended line emission which can not be ruled out at present and should be mentioned for completeness .",
    "shock excitation of the gas is an interesting possibility , and we note that @xcite , in a study of emission - line regions in m  31 , found that supernova remnants which are believed to be dominated by shock excitation , showed [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios in the range 0.48 - 1.2 , mean 0.707 , very similar to those of the sfd regions of the present galaxy sample , after application of the h@xmath0 absorption correction .",
    "another possible source of shocks is of course the bar itself , which motivates a further study of the strength of this diffuse emission as a function of angular separation from the bar axis .",
    "unfortunately this can not be done with the present data set , due to only having single long - slit observations of each galaxy .",
    "the recent study by @xcite provides a particularly interesting source of comparison for the present work , as it reached very similar overall conclusions , but by quite different methods .",
    "@xcite looked at 48 galaxies classified as showing liner emission from within the califa survey @xcite , an integral field study of @xmath1600 galaxies in the low - redshift ( 0.005@xmath20 z @xmath20 0.03 ) universe .",
    "@xcite show convincingly that , while the liner classifications are based on spectra extracted from a central region 3@xmath5 in diameter , the lines contributing to the liner - type ratios fall off much more slowly than would be expected were they to be driven by a single nuclear source such as an agn . thus they strongly prefer a stellar explanation , such as p - agb stars .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our results directly with two of the galaxies shown as examples in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "this figure includes two star forming spiral galaxies , the first of which , ngc  4210 , is also in the present study .",
    "the emission - line spatial distribution of this galaxy , as found by @xcite very nicely matches the central peak / star formation desert / outer star formation ring pattern found here .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find a perfect trend for liner - type line ratios in the central peak and star - formation line ratios in the outer disk , but they do not apparently detect any emission from the intermediate sfd region itself .",
    "we do detect sfd emission in this galaxy ; while not one of the strongest , [ nii ] emission is clearly detected in both sfd regions analysed , and h@xmath0 emission is seen from one of them . the other spiral galaxy shown in fig .",
    "2 of @xcite is also very interesting .",
    "this galaxy , ugc  11680 , shows clear seyfert - type emission from its nuclear region in the califa data , with star - formation ratios in the spiral arms , and liner - type ratios scattered across an extended region of the disk , in the interarm regions .",
    "this extended liner emission is very similar to that found in the present paper .",
    "however , it is not clear whether ugc  11680 is directly comparable , as it may not be barred ( the central bulge shows an extended morphology that is consistent with a weak bar , but the ned classification is scd ) , and it is also undergoing a strong interaction with an early - type companion , which complicates the interpretation .    one other area requiring further study is the range of galaxies exhibiting this behaviour , as this study has quite explicitly made use of galaxies with carefully defined properties .",
    "the 15 galaxies studied are all clearly barred , with 10 having strong - bar sb classifications and the remaining 5 being sab types , and they are generally bright and massive spiral galaxies .",
    "most are quite early type spirals , with sbb being the most common type , and here it is relevant to mention the bimodality of barred galaxies discussed by @xcite ( and confirmed by our analysis of galaxies from the h@xmath0gs survey ) .",
    "these authors separate out two types of bars : dynamically strong bars in early - type disk galaxies with dominant old , red stellar populations ; and dynamically weaker bars in late - type , low - mass , gas - rich spirals .",
    "analysis of the colour images produced from the multi - passband sdss galaxy images illustrates this point well .",
    "as noted above , all but one of the present sample lie within the sdss footprint , making such images available @xcite , and an illustrative subset is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sdss_four_galaxies ] .",
    "these images clearly show that the radial range swept out by the bar has red colours , indicating that an old stellar population is dominant , while the disk regions outside this region have blue colours indicative of ongoing star formation .",
    "this pattern is not seen for late - type barred galaxies of type sbd or similar , where the bar regions also show blue colours .",
    "if this bimodality in the effects of early- and late - type bars is real , the activity we are investigating in the present paper appears to be linked with the early - type hosts , and to be most marked in sbb types ( range sba - sbc approximately ) .",
    "this raises obvious questions about whether the activity we find in the sfd regions of these galaxies is occurring in galaxies with later - type bars , and indeed in galaxies generally .",
    "the sdss images also enable checks to be made of the environment of our galaxies .",
    "overall , they confirm that this is predominantly a sample of very isolated galaxies .",
    "ngc  3185 is considered a member of the ngc  3190 group of galaxies , but it is well separated ( 11@xmath21 - 17@xmath21 projected separation ) from the other three bright members of this group .",
    "ngc  5806 is a member of the ngc  5846 group , but again is well separated ( 21@xmath21 ) from the nearest group member .",
    "finally , ngc  3367 is apparently close to the leo group of galaxies , but is considered to be in the background due to a much higher redshift ( 3040  km  s@xmath11 c.f .",
    "910  km  s@xmath11 for the group ) .",
    "thus we conclude that none of the present sample has evidence for a close companion which could be causing significant tidal disturbance , or other interaction effects which might cause shock excitation of gas .",
    "we note that galaxies showing the characteristic sfd identified here give a particularly clean view of emission lines not associated with sf , in a region which is not accessible in unbarred galaxies , i.e. away from the nucleus , but within the central few kpc . in unbarred spiral galaxies ,",
    "this region is host to the dominant sf activity ( in surface density , and as a fraction of the total sf activity in these galaxies ) , making it impossible to detect low - level diffuse activity .",
    "the sfds are an excellent environment for further study of these anomalous line ratios , being a clean stellar population with little contamination from either agn or sf activity .",
    "the main conclusions of the present study are as follows :    * barred galaxies , at least of earlier hubble types , have strongly suppressed star formation in the radial range swept out by their bars . *",
    "these extended ` star formation desert ' regions do however show line emission , with h@xmath0 and/or the [ nii ] 6584    line being detected in virtually all of the barred galaxies in the present study . * the observed line ratios are not consistent with expectations for star formation regions , but have high [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios more characteristic of liner - type emission .",
    "this conclusion holds regardless of the adopted correction for underlying stellar absorption at h@xmath0 . *",
    "the spatial distribution of line emission is also not consistent with expectations of star - forming regions , being low surface brightness diffuse emission extended on scales of several kpc . *",
    "the diffuse emission lines show a strong rotation signal consistent with the kinematics of the stellar disk . * the strength of the diffuse components in both h@xmath0 and [ nii ] emission is correlated with the red continuum from the local old stellar population . * the total emission integrated over the sfd region is typically only a few per cent of the line emission of the whole galaxy in which it sits . *",
    "our preferred model is that this emission is powered by p - agb stars from the old stellar population ; agn and leakage from hii regions do not seem plausible explanations , but shock processes can not be ruled out and merit further investigation .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the optical line emission from nearby barred galaxies , and in particular look at the radial range occupied by the bar . in many cases this region </S>",
    "<S> is marked by what we term a ` star formation desert ' , with a marked deficit of hii regions in optical narrow - band h@xmath0 imaging . </S>",
    "<S> here we present long - slit spectroscopy revealing that such regions do have line emission , but that it is low - level , spatially smooth and almost ubiquitous . </S>",
    "<S> the relative strengths of the h@xmath0 and the spectrally adjacent [ nii ] lines in the regions are completely discrepant from those associated with star formation regions , and more closely match expectations for ` liner ' regions . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the total line emission from these extended , kpc - scale regions , and determine the spurious contribution it would make to the determined star formation rate of these galaxies if interpreted as normal h@xmath0 emission . </S>",
    "<S> we concur with previous studies that link this ` liner ' emission to old stellar populations , e.g. post - asymptotic giant branch stars , and propose these strongly - barred early - type spirals as a prime location for further tests of such emission .
