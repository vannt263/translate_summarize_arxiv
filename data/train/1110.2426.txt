    "in recent years the search for extrasolar planets has resulted in the discovery of the first confirmed rocky planets with minimum masses below 10 m@xmath0 ( hereafter super - earths ) @xcite and radii below 2 r@xmath0 , consistent with rocky planet models @xcite .",
    "many of the detected super - earths are located extremely close to their stars , at distances much less than mercury to the sun .",
    "these close - in hot super - earths can reach temperatures high enough to melt the silicates present on their surfaces by irradiation from their host star alone .",
    "this causes outgassing and the subsequent formation of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "the formation of a rocky planet s atmosphere is a complex process built up from initial capture and degassing of material of meteoritic composition .",
    "our model is based on work by @xcite and assumes , as a first order approximation , that at temperatures @xmath11000 k , the material present on the surface of the planet vaporizes and forms an outgassed atmosphere . in this process",
    ", the atmosphere is strongly dependent on the planetary composition @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the specific case of corot-7b and showed that these close - in planets may have a silicate atmosphere as a result of outgassing of magma on the surface .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission recently announced 1235 planetary candidates @xcite , of which 615 are consistent with models of rocky interior ( @xmath2 0.5 r@xmath0 , accounting for the 25% error in radii in the kepler data set ) .",
    "193 of these _ kepler _ objects of interest ( koi ) have potentially extremely high temperatures on their surfaces ( @xmath11000 k , when assuming a 0.01 albedo ) , due to the intense stellar irradiation to which they are exposed , because of their proximity to the central star .    in this work",
    ", we explore the composition of initial planetary atmospheres of hot super - earths in the kepler planet candidate sample , according to their semi major axis .",
    "our approach can be applied to current and future candidates provided by the kepler mission and other exoplanet searches .",
    "we use the magma code @xcite which calculates the equilibrium between the melt and vapor in a magma exposed at temperatures higher than 1000 k @xcite , for al , ca , fe , k , mg , na , o , si , ti and their compounds .    we assume that the initial composition of a hot super - earth is similar to the composition of komatiites , which are ultramafic lavas that were erupted during the archaean on earth ( 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago ) , when earth had a higher surface temperature .",
    "this choice is also supported by the work by @xcite , who showed , for the case of the earth and mars , that a more massive planet has a lower composition of feo in the mantle than a less massive one , a consequence of the solubility of oxygen in liquid iron - alloy , which increases with temperature .",

    "we find that the compositions of the atmospheres do not show significant changes when considering different planetary masses .",

    "the composition of the atmosphere depends strongly on the composition of the planetary interior .",
    "we show the changes in the characterization when adopting two known compositions taken from our solar system , but substantially different compositions are possible .    following @xcite , we consider atmospheres produced by the outgassing of a volatile - free magma . at these extreme temperatures , elements such as h , c , n and s should escape from the atmosphere in short timescales and consequently are not present in the atmosphere .",
    "this assumption is supported by observations of volatile loss in rocky bodies @xcite and studies in hot - jupiters @xcite and hot super - earths @xcite .",
    "if the volatiles were not lost , the atmosphere would be dominated by volatiles . in this paper",
    "we only concentrate on close - in , hot planetary candidates , consistent with volatile free atmospheres .",
    "cooler planets that could potentially provide habitable conditions are not discussed here ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we have adopted a bond albedo for the planets of @xmath7=0.01 .",
    "this assumption is supported by observations @xcite and modeling @xcite of hot exoplanets , which find very low albedo .",
    "although there are currently no indications that suggest higher albedos for hot rocky planets , we studied the effect of a higher albedo on our results . when changing the albedo from 0.01 to e.g. 0.2 , the size of the sample is affected .",
    "for an albedo of 0.2 , only 146 planetary candidates with radius less than 2.5 r@xmath0 have @xmath12 k. of these 146 planets , 144 are characterized by atmospheres type i , 1 by type ii , 1 by type iii , 0 by type iv and 0 by type v ( adopting komatiite composition ) .",
    "we assume here that the planets are only heated by the irradiation of the star .",
    "other heat sources like short - lived radioisotopes , impacts , core formation and tidal effects can increase the surface temperature .",
    "@xcite showed that the insolation is the most important heating source for planets with periods larger than @xmath23 2 days and for planets with shorter periods and non eccentric orbits . for very eccentric planets ( @xmath330.1 ) which orbit their star with periods less than @xmath23 2 days , tidal heating dominates over insolation .",
    "we explore the effects of tidal heating in the kepler planetary candidates with @xmath34 2 days , using eq .",
    "[ tides ] @xcite ,    @xmath35    where , @xmath36 is the second - order love number of the planet . for a super - earth",
    "we adopt 0.3 ( henning personal communication ) , @xmath37 is the quality factor of the planet , @xmath38 its mean motion and @xmath39 the eccentricity , which is unknown for the kepler candidates .",
    "we adopt different values for @xmath39 and @xmath37 .",
    "most of the candidates that might be affected are located very close to the star ( @xmath6 less than @xmath23 0.03 au ) , where we expect almost circular orbits .",
    "we adopt @xmath400.001 and @xmath400.01 and two different values for @xmath37 : 200 and 20000 , which represent planets with limited partial melting or significant partial melting in the mantle , respectively @xcite , to explore this effect . in the four cases analyzed",
    ", we find that there is no significant change in the surface temperatures of these planets when considering heating by insolation plus tidal effects compared to heating by insolation only .",
    "the role of tides in these planets , if occurring , will be to increase the convective vigor of the mantle , causing a larger fraction of total mantle volume to be accessible to surface degassing , but will not change the surface temperature significantly .",
    "in this work we explore the different atmospheric composition of hot super - earth candidates from the february _ kepler _ database according to their radii , semi - major axis and stellar effective temperature .",
    "615 kepler planet candidates have radii less than 2.5 r@xmath0 , of which 193 have calculated surface temperatures larger than 1000 k ( assuming an albedo of 0.01 ) , and are the focus of this work .",
    "we model the initial planetary atmospheric compositions for komatiite and bulk silicate earth magma compositions .",
    "the planet surface temperatures were calculated assuming insolation only .",
    "we discuss the consequences of adopting different sources of heating and find that tidal heating is not important when adopting low eccentricities , consistent with the _ kepler _ sample .",
    "the results indicate 5 types of atmospheres , based on the abundance of the dominant gases ( fe , mg , na , o , o@xmath15 and sio ) .",
    "when adopting komatiite composition , 189 of 193 _ kepler _ candidates present a type i model atmosphere dominated by monatomic na , o@xmath15 , monatomic o and monatomic fe .",
    "three planetary candidates are characterized by type ii atmospheres , where sio becomes more abundant than monatomic fe , no candidates with type iii atmospheres , where monatomic mg is more abundant than monatomic fe , and only one planet is characterized by type iv , with a large abundance of sio .",
    "finally , there is no kepler planetary candidate with an atmosphere of type v , which is completely dominated by sio .",
    "this atmospheric characterization is almost independent of the planetary mass between 1 - 10 m@xmath0 and low eccentricities .",
    "the initial magma composition is important for the resulting atmospheric gases , especially for lower surface temperatures .",
    "we find that the distance from the host star is the dominant factor to characterize a rocky planet s atmosphere .",
