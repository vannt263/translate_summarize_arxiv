    "many of the alarms ( 80% to 99%  @xcite ) could be false and/or clinically insignificant which are not related to patient condition .",

    "dealing with false alarms is widely considered the number one hazard imposed by the medical technology and an important concern in icus  @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been utilized to decrease the number of false alarms as reviewed in  @xcite and @xcite .    in @xcite , a genetic algorithm - based approach for false alarm reduction",
    "is proposed , where the features are extracted from electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , arterial blood pressure ( abp ) , and photoplethysmogram ( ppg or pleth ) arrhythmia patients . using a relevance vector machine ( rvm ) as a classifier ,",
    "false alarm suppression was reported to be @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively for asystole , extreme extreme bradycardia and extreme tachycardia . an automated method for false arrhythmia suppression was proposed in  @xcite that is based on quality assessment of normal and abnormal rhythms of ecg signals .",
    "different approaches including k  nearest neighbors ( knn ) , naive bayes , decision tree , svm and multi  layer perception have been tested on a database from mimic ii for alarms classification , where features have been extracted from age , sex , central venous pressure ( cvp ) , spo2 , abp , ecg and pulmonary arterial pressure ( pap ) @xcite .",
    "the suppression rate for true alarm detection is between 2.33% and 17.73% for 5 alarms and false alarm suppression rate is between 71.73% to 99.23% .",
    "the aforementioned models considered a number of features / parameters extracted from multiple continuously  measured physiological signals .",
    "the main challenge in these multi ",
    "parameter approaches is the presence of many parameters / features that individually have low impact on the model performance , which may not be included in the model , while when coupled with other such parameters could significantly improve the accuracy and specificity of the alarm detection algorithms .",
    "different hybrid feature selection algorithms have been utilized in big data analysis problems to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability through reducing the feature space to a more concise and relevant set of attributes @xcite .",
    "of the three major approaches for feature selection filter - based , wrapper - based @xcite , and embedded methods @xcite  the last two are known to be susceptible to overfitting and are computationally intensive @xcite . the majority of these conventional methods , either only account for the effect of individual features on the target or consider the inter - feature mutual information to obtain higher performance .",
    "this often results in discarding the features that are relevant to the target class but are highly correlated to the ones that are already selected .",
    "this can significantly degrade the performance of the model in scenarios where a set of features together have a considerable effect on the classifier , while each individual attribute in the set does not @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a coalition - based game theoretic model for feature selection that accounts for intrinsic inter - features correlation among the predictors across the data sets to improve the accuracy of our model .",
    "coalition game theory has been recently utilized in data analysis problems to improve the performance of feature selection by considering the contribution of the features on classification accuracy when the features are grouped with other features in the data set @xcite . in @xcite , we proposed a coalition - based game theoretic feature selection method to determine the salient features over a heterogeneous data set to predict the hemorrhage severity , where the features are modeled as the game players .",

    "three main signals ; ecg , abp , and pleth are used as the inputs of our proposed model . in the first stage ( i.e. signal analysis )",
    "wavelet coefficients of each signal at different levels of decomposition are calculated using a discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) on the 1d input signals . at each level of decomposition process",
    ", dwt decomposes the signals into approximate and detail coefficients .",
    "approximation set is obtained by applying a high  pass filter at low scales and detail coefficients are computed by applying a low  pass filter at high scales .",
    "we used daubechies 8 ( db8 ) for ecg signal as there is a good match between the shape of ecg signal and this wavelet .",
    "daubechies 4 is used for pleth and abp signals for the same reason .",
    "each of the three aforementioned signals are decomposed into @xmath3 levels by convolving the high - pass and low  pass filters .",
    "feeding all these wavelet coefficients as features into the classification algorithm is not efficient and may significantly decrease the generalization property of the trained model due to over  fitting .",
    "therefore , we reduce the number of features by extracting 20 representative statistical and information  theoretic properties of the wavelet vectors .",
    "cooperative game theory has been recently utilized in feature selection algorithms @xcite . in these games , the players cooperate with each other by forming various sub  groups called _ coalitions_. these games are defined based on exhaustive scenarios that players may form a group and how the total shared payoff is divided among the members . a transferable utility coalition ( tu  coalition ) game with @xmath4 players can be defined by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the set of players , @xmath7 , and _",

    "different possible grouping of the features are examined to recognize the optimal coalition .",
    "the contribution of feature @xmath19 in classification accuracy when it joins a coalition @xmath10 is defined by _",

    "let s define the value function , @xmath21 that assigns an @xmath4tuple of real numbers , @xmath22 to each possible characteristic function , in which @xmath23 measures the value of player @xmath19 in the game with characteristic function @xmath8 .",
    "_ shapley value _ can be utilized as a fair unique solution of the coalition game @xcite .",
    "the shapley value of player @xmath19 is defined as the weighted mean of its marginal importance over all possible subsets of the players .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the set of all @xmath26 permutations over @xmath6 and @xmath27 is the set of features ( players ) preceding player @xmath19 in permutation @xmath28 . since in feature selection , the order of features in a coalition does not change the value of coalition , the calculations in ( [ eq : sh1 ] ) , can be further simplified by excluding the permutation of coalitions in the average : @xmath29 where @xmath30 presents the coalitions that player @xmath19 does not belong to .",
    "it is equivalent to the weighted average of coalitions , where the weight of each coalition is the number of its all possible permutations . as shown in ( [ eq : sh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sh2 ] ) , the shapely value solution accounts for all possible coalitions that can be formed by the players @xcite .",
    "since in false alarm detection problem , the data set includes a large number of features , thereby calculating the shapley value would be computationally intractable .",
    "therefore , we utilize the multi ",

    ", the features are randomly divided into groups of size @xmath31 .",
    "then , we calculate the corresponding multi - perturbation shapely value of feature @xmath19 inside its group , @xmath32 considering all possible coalitions of size @xmath33 .",

    "there is an essential trade  off to set @xmath31 in the proposed method .",
    "large @xmath31 values consider higher order relations , while increasing the complexity of finding multi  perturbation shapely value at each subgroup .",
    "we conjecture that the optimum value of @xmath31 for our datasets taking into account various factors such as the nature of data , number of features , and the inter - feature dependence is in the range of @xmath36 to @xmath3 .",
    "this is confirmed by simulation results in section [ numerical ] .",
    "for this study , we used a publicly available physionnet s mimic ii databaset  @xcite , where measurement for three vital signals ecg , pleth , and apb are provided for @xmath37 patients and each subject is labeled as _ true _ , _ false _ , or impossible to tell .",
    "we first apply six - level wavelet decomposition to obtain time - frequency information at different resolutions .",
    "therefore , each sample is represented by @xmath38 vectors of wavelet coefficients .",
    "subsequently , @xmath39 statistical and information - theoretic features are extracted from each of the vectors , resulting in total of @xmath40 features .",

    "the 30 most informative features are selected to compare the performance of different feature selection techniques .",
    "the comparison results in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] suggest a considerable improvement for the proposed method in discarding the false alarms compared to the competitor methods .",
    "the alarm typing success rate for the proposed method is about @xmath42 meaning that only @xmath43 of alarms are deemed false , whereas the false alarm report rate for the best competitor method ( gain ratio ) is at least @xmath44 .",
    "the improvement is due to potential synergy impact of coalitions among features which is overlooked or not directly addressed in other methods .",
    "the proposed method outperforms the case of incorporating all wavelet coefficients ( represented by none in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) due to eliminating the irrelevant features .",
    "it is notable that the promising rate of @xmath42 is obtained using only 30 statistical features for any subject , which significantly reduces the risk of over  fitting compared to using all @xmath45 wavelet coefficients for each signal .",
    "the average appearance of signals are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "it is clear from these results that the first wavelet decomposition level of _ ecg _ and _ pleth _ signals play significantly higher roles in the alarm validation .",
    "indeed , the collective contribution of levels 2 to 6 are less than the contribution of level 1 solely",
