    "leptoquarks ( lq ) are hypothetical particles that are predicted by many extensions  @xcite of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) , such as grand unification theory , technicolor and composite models .",
    "they carry both baryon and lepton numbers and thus couple to a lepton and a quark .",
    "they carry fractional electric charge , they are color triples , and can have either zero or one unit of spin ( i.e. can be either scalar or vector particles ) . existing experimental limits on lepton number violation , flavor changing neutral current , proton decay , and other rare processes favor three generations of leptoquarks , with no inter - generational mixing .    the production and decay of lqs",
    "are characterized by : the mass of the lq particle ( m@xmath0 ) , its decay branching ratio into a lepton and a quark ( usually denoted as @xmath1 ) and the yukawa coupling at the lq - lepton - quark vertex ( @xmath2 ) . at hadron colliders ,",
    "leptoquarks are mainly produced in pairs , via gluon - gluon fusion and quark anti - quark annihilation .",
    "the dominant pair production mechanisms do not depend strongly on @xmath2 and the single production of leptoquarks does not become significant ( and it does not in any case invalidate the search results presented here ) in the range of lq masses probed with the 2010 lhc data .",
    "the final state event signatures from the decay of pair produced lqs can be classified as : dilepton and jets ( both lq and anti - lq decay into a charged lepton and a quark ) ; lepton , missing transverse energy and a jet ( one lq decays into a charged lepton and a quark , while the other decays into a neutrino and a quark ) ; and missing transverse energy and jets ( both lq and anti - lq decay into neutrinos and quarks ) .",
    "the three signatures have branching ratios of @xmath3 , 2@xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the charged leptons can be either electrons , muons , or tau leptons , corresponding to the three generation of lqs .",
    "only electrons and muons are considered here .",
    "searches for first and second generation pair - produced scalar lqs were performed and published on 34 - 36 pb@xmath6 of 7 tev proton - proton collision data recorded by the cms detector  @xcite during the 2010 lhc run .",
    "first generation results include searches both in the dilepton and jets final state ( @xmath7 ) , and in the lepton , missing transverse energy and jets final state ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "second generation result consist of a search in the dilepton and jets final state ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 results were combined to attain the best possible exclusion reach in all of the parameter space of the first generation pair produced scalar lq search , i.e. ( @xmath1 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the analysis in all of the channels aims at identifying the existence of new heavy particles by establishing an excess of events characteristic of the decay of heavy objects .",
    "the analysis starts with using either a single or a double lepton trigger path , which is robust and very efficient .",
    "an event signature preselection isolates events with high transverse momentum final state objects ( two or more isolated leptons and two or more jets , or one isolated lepton , two or more jets , and significant missing transverse energy indicative of the presence of a neutrino ) .",
    "event variables are identified to effectively separate a possible lq signal from standard model backgrounds ( these are the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 variables described below ) and lower thresholds are placed on these variables at preselection level .",
    "backgrounds from standard model sources are estimated and first compared with data at the preselection level .",
    "major sources of background are @xmath14+jets and @xmath15jets processes and @xmath16 ( with single top production , diboson processes , and qcd multijet processes being smaller contributions ) .",
    "major backgrounds are either directly determined from data control samples or determined with monte carlo samples ( therefore using kinematic shape information from the mc ) but normalized to data in selected control regions .",
    "a cut - based variable approach is used for the final selection , where the selection is optimized for different lq mass hypotheses by minimizing the expected upper limit on the lq cross section in the absence of an observed signal using a bayesian approach  @xcite .",
    "the three variables used in the optimization are : the scalar sum of the final objects transverse momenta , @xmath11 ; the invariant mass of the dilepton pair , @xmath17 , for the @xmath7 and @xmath9 channels ; and the transverse mass , @xmath13 , of the lepton and neutrino in the @xmath8 analysis .",
    "after final selection , the data are well described by the standard model background predictions . in the absence of an observed signal , an upper limit on the lq cross section",
    "is set using a bayesian method  @xcite with a flat signal prior .",
    "a lognormal prior is used to integrate over the nuisance parameters . using poisson statistics , a 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "upper limit is obtained on the lq pair - production cross - section times branching ratio as a function of lq mass . comparing with the nlo predictions  @xcite for the scalar lq pair production cross section a lower limit on @xmath10",
    "is determined for @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( electron only , for the latter ) . in the electron channel",
    ", the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels are combined to further maximize the exclusion in @xmath1 and @xmath10 , specially for the case of @xmath19 , where the @xmath7 adds to the sensitivity of the @xmath8 channel .",
    "the @xmath7 analysis requires the presence of a single or double electromagnetic trigger ( with an efficiency close to 100@xmath20 ) , two or more isolated electrons with @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 , and two or more jets with @xmath21 gev and @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , at pre - selection level , @xmath24 is required together with a minimum threshold of @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 gev .",
    "data and standard model background predictions agree well at the level of pre - selection , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eeprelpte ] , and  [ eeprelst ] .",
    "this channel uses an integrated luminosity of 33.2 pb@xmath6 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath9 analysis starts from the requirement of a single muon trigger ( with an efficiency of 99@xmath20 ) , two or more isolated muons with @xmath21 gev and @xmath27 ( one of which must be within @xmath28 ) , and two or more jets with @xmath21 gev and @xmath23 .",
    "the two muons are required to be separated in @xmath29 by at least 0.3 .",
    "minimum thresholds of @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 gev complete the preselection requirements .",
    "good agreement is observed between data and standard model background predictions at this level ( fig.s  [ mmprelptm ] and  [ mmprelst ] ) .",
    "this channel uses an integrated luminosity of 34.0 pb@xmath6 .",
    "the major backgrounds from standard model processes to the dilepton and jets channels come from @xmath32 jets and @xmath16 production . the @xmath33 contribution is determined from mc , but it is rescaled to the data in the z peak region at preselection .",
    "the invariant mass of the dilepton pair is shown in fig .",
    "[ eepreldimass ] and in fig .",
    "[ mmpreldimass ] for the @xmath7 and @xmath9 channel , respectively .",
    "the normalization factors are @xmath34 for @xmath7 and @xmath35 for @xmath9 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath32 jets background prediction in both channels comes from the statistically dominated uncertainty in the normalization factors and from a shape uncertainty obtained by comparing the yields of @xmath32 jets mc samples generated with different renormalization and factorization scales and matching thresholds .",
    "the @xmath16 normalization uncertainty is based on a cms measurement of the @xmath16 cross - section  @xcite .",
    "smaller @xmath15 jets and diboson plus jets backgrounds are determined entirely from mc and are found to be negligible .",
    "the background contributions from qcd multijet processes are determined from data control regions and are also found to be negligible .        at final selection , a dilepton invariant mass cut ( @xmath36125 gev and @xmath37115 gev ) is placed to suppress most of the @xmath33 jets background and a @xmath11 threshold is optimized for each @xmath10 hypothesis .",
    "@xmath11 is effective at removing most of the @xmath16 background and any residual backgrounds surviving the preselection criteria and the cut on the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "the number of data , signal mc , and background events for each of the final selection criteria optimized for different @xmath10 are listed in table  [ tab : eejjsummary ] and table  [ tab : mumujjsummary ] for the @xmath7 and @xmath9 channels respectively , together with the optimized @xmath11 thresholds .       in absence of an excess above standard model backgrounds expectation , an upper limit on the lq cross section",
    "is set using a bayesian method similar to the one used in the @xmath7 analysis .",
    "the @xmath8 channel has maximum sensitivity for @xmath19 , and also offers sensitivity for lower values of @xmath1 , where the @xmath7 channel quickly runs out of sensitivity due to the quadratic behavior of the branching fraction of the lq pair into the above channel .",
    "thus , combining it with the @xmath7 channel allows one to extend the sensitivity of the search in the intermediate @xmath1 range compared to either of the two analysis considered separately .",
    "the two channels are combined using the same bayesian approach used to set the individual limits . assuming a flat prior for the signal cross section , the expected signal yield in the @xmath7 [ @xmath8 ] channel is found by multiplying the cross section by the signal efficiency , integrated luminosity , and the branching fraction @xmath3 [ @xmath39 .",
    "since the major sources of systematic uncertainty between the two channels are correlated , a combined likelihood is constructed from the individual likelihoods for the two channels . the 95% c.l .",
    "mass limit as a function of @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ eecombbeta ] , along with the individual limits from the two channels . with the assumption",
    "that @xmath40 , first generation scalar leptoquarks with masses less than 340  gev are excluded at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite .",
    "searches for pair production of first and second generation scalar leptoquarks have been performed at cms in the final states with : two charged leptons and two jets , one charged lepton ( electron ) , missing transverse energy and two jets , with the full 2010 statistics . in the absence of a signal we exclude first generation lq with masses below 384 gev ( @xmath41 ) , second generation lq with masses below 394 gev ( @xmath41 ) , and first generation lq with masses below 340 gev ( @xmath19 ) . the @xmath18 results were the most stringent limits at the time of publication .",
