    "although parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the nucleon are now determined relatively well in the wide range of @xmath2 , their nuclear modifications are not determined accurately .",
    "there are experimental measurements about nuclear effects on the pdfs , for example nuclear @xmath5 data , so that their gross properties are known .",
    "however , the details are not still determined because available experimental data exist for a limited number of high - energy nuclear reactions .",
    "on the other hand , accurate nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) @xcite are needed for describing any high - energy nuclear reactions such as heavy - ion and neutrino reactions .",
    "the major purpose of this workshop is to discuss nuclear effects on neutrino reactions @xcite .",
    "since neutrino - oscillation experiments @xcite become more and more accurate , it is now important to take nuclear medium effects into account .",
    "current oscillation experiments are done in a medium - energy region , so that there are various nuclear effects which contribute to the neutrino reactions . among them",
    ", we investigate nuclear medium effects on the pdfs .",
    "of course , the parton distributions are supposed to be used in the deep inelastic ( dis ) region , so that an extension to a smaller @xmath4 region becomes important in order to use them for the present neutrino reactions .    in this paper",
    ", we report our recent studies on the npdfs by analyzing the nuclear data on the structure - function ratios @xmath0 and drell - yan cross - section ratios @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we had already reported the npdf studies on the first version @xcite at the nuint01 workshop @xcite and preliminary studies after the first version at the nuint02 @xcite .",
    "the most important point in ref .",
    "@xcite is that uncertainties of the npdfs are estimated by the hessian method . for calculating any nuclear reactions ,",
    "it is especially important to show the uncertainties which come from the pdfs .",
    "furthermore , drell - yan and hermes data are added into the data set and the charm - quark distributions are included in the new analysis .",
    "this paper consists of the following . in section [ method ] , a method",
    "is explained for analyzing @xmath5 and drell - yan data in order to obtain the optimum npdfs .",
    "analysis results are shown in section [ results ] .",
    "we provide a code for calculating the npdfs at given @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and it is explained in section [ code ] . the results are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "the parton distribution functions are expressed in general by two variables , @xmath2 and @xmath4 . in lepton - nucleus scattering ,",
    "the @xmath4 is defined by the momentum transfer @xmath6 : @xmath7 , and the bjorken scaling variable @xmath2 is given by @xmath8 with the nucleon mass @xmath9 and the energy transfer @xmath10 .",
    "the npdfs are provided by an analytical form at a fixed @xmath4 point ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "practically , a npdf could be expressed by the corresponding nucleonic distribution multiplied by a function @xmath12 : @xmath13 we call @xmath12 a weight function , which indicates nuclear modification .",
    "the function is expressed by a number of parameters : @xmath14    the parameters are determined by a @xmath15 analysis with experimental data on structure functions @xmath16 and drell - yan cross sections @xmath17 . because of baryon - number , charge , and momentum conservations , three parameters can be fixed . the cubic functional form of the numerator is motivated by the @xmath2 dependence of typical data for @xmath18 , and the factor @xmath19 is to reproduce the fermi - motion part at large @xmath2 .",
    "the nuclear dependence @xmath20 is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite simply by considering nuclear volume and surface contributions to cross sections .",
    "because different physics mechanisms contribute in each @xmath2 region , the overall @xmath21 dependence would be too simple to describe the nuclear modifications .",
    "for the npdfs @xmath22 , we take @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 by assuming flavor symmetric antiquark distributions although they are not symmetric in the nucleon @xcite .",

    "leading - order expressions are used in the theoretical calculations .",
    "the actual calculation is done by running the subroutine minuit .",
    "the subroutine also produces a hessian matrix @xmath30 which has information on parameter errors . using the matrix",
    ", we can calculate the uncertainty of a npdf : @xmath31 ^ 2 = \\delta \\chi^2   &   \\sum_{i , j }             \\left ( \\frac{\\partial f^a(x,\\xi)}{\\partial \\xi_i }                                \\right)_{\\xi=\\hat\\xi } \\nonumber \\\\     & \\times        h_{ij}^{-1 }            \\left ( \\frac{\\partial f^a(x,\\xi)}{\\partial \\xi_j }                                \\right)_{\\xi=\\hat\\xi } \\ , ,          \\label{eq : dnpdf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a parameter , @xmath33 indicates the optimum set of the parameters , and @xmath34 is the uncertainty of the nuclear pdf @xmath35 .",
