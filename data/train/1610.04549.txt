    "the investigation of structure and dynamics of networks has been a powerful strategy to analyze interacting many - body problems present in many different areas : biological , ecological , economical and social systems , to name some of them .",
    "the map of these systems into graphs is a fruitful old idea , and the knowledge of the interconnection between its vertices is a necessary condition that allows us to examine a myriad of pratical problems @xcite .",
    "nowadays , there are several research interests involving complex networks .",
    "we can say , for instance , that there is an effort to obtain a better understanding of networks from some of its internal structures like the formation of communities @xcite , or a more complex interconnection of graphs like the multilayer networks @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the internal structure reflects on the entropy of the network @xcite , which shows the possibility of classifying several internal structures . at the same time",
    ", we still have progress on important questions that use complex networks as a framework to define other problems on it ; for instance , we can cite the active area of epidemiological models @xcite , or statistical models on complex networks to analyze critical phenomena @xcite .    at this point",
    ", it is worth mentioning that despite the progress in several directions , it is natural that analytical results are less frequent than numerical ones , which is understandable due to the technical complexities presented by many relevant questions .",
    "furthermore , many existing analytical results come from stationary regime . in this scenario ,",
    "we propose a scheme that estimates the time - dependent degree distribution . in order to illustrate our idea",
    ", we revisited the watts - strogatz model @xcite .",
    "although not being a complex networkin the sense that it does not display a heterogeneous degree distribution @xcite , it has small - world property and has high clustering @xcite , two properties shared with many real networks .",
    "the model was originally defined as an intermediate configuration between a regular lattice and a graph where all their nodes are randomly linked , and we will present a slightly modified version from the original one in order to capture its dynamical evolution analytically .    the layout of this work is as follows . in purpose of illustrating the main idea of the work , we start with a dynamical version of the erds - rnyi model @xcite in section 2 and we introduce the main model , the time - dependent watts - strogatz graph , in section 3 . then , we present the main idea that allow one to achieve an analytical form for the dynamic degree distribution in section 4 . some final comments are presented in section 5 .",
    "the initial condition of the model consists of @xmath0 vertices and no edges at time @xmath1 . at each time step ,",
    "two vertices are randomly chosen and linked ; this includes the possibility of having a loop ( an edge that connects a vertex to itself ) .",
    "it is clear that each end of an edge links to a vertex with probability @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , defining @xmath3 as the probability that a vertex @xmath4 has degree @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , one can represent the dynamics as @xmath7 with @xmath8 as the initial condition , where @xmath9 is the kronecker symbol ( @xmath10 when @xmath11 , and @xmath12 otherwise ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath13 is the time - independent conditional probability of changing the degree of a vertex from @xmath14 to @xmath5 ; in the present case , @xmath15 by introducing the time - dependent degree distribution , @xmath16 the time evolution equation ( [ er_me ] ) can be written as @xmath17 if now one introduces the z - transform @xmath18 it is straightforward that @xmath19 where the initial condition is @xmath20 and @xmath21 from ( [ l_er ] ) , one sees that the right - hand side of ( [ phiphi0 ] ) is a polynomial in @xmath22 , and the time - dependent degree distribution @xmath23 is the coefficient of the term of order @xmath24 ( which we will refer as @xmath24-term ) in the right hand side of ( [ phiphi0 ] ) .",
    "hence , since @xmath25 , one can show by a direct calculation that @xmath26 this result will be revisited in section [ rw ] , where we will treat the problem of finding the time - dependent degree distribution as a random walk in degree space .    when @xmath27 , which is the time equivalent to the number of possible distinct edges , one recovers the poisson distribution from the usual erds - rnyi model for @xmath28 , @xmath29    the exact form of the time - dependent degree distribution can be used to investigate the shannon entropy , @xmath30\\ , .",
    "\\label{shannon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the profile of the entropy can be investigated numerically and is presented in figure 1 .",
    "it starts from a low value and achieves the maximum for @xmath31 , which is when the original ( static ) erds - rnyi model realizes , and the inclusion of more connections decreases the entropy , as one can see from ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be heuristically understood by realizing that the inclusion of edges randomly ( with uniform probability to each possible pair of nodes ) leads the distribution to converge to a kronecker delta , _",
    "i.e. _ , the vertices tend to have all the same degree ( that increases with time ) from the statistical standpoint .",
    "figure 1 : entropy of time - dependent erds - rnyi model ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the watts - strogatz model @xcite is a small - world network that , unlike the erds - rnyi graph , keeps high clustering .",
    "the analytical approach treats it as a static model , despite the fact that it is obtained as an intermediate configuration in rewiring process between a regular lattice and a random graph .",
    "we will define a dynamical model that generates a small - world network similar to the one introduced by watts and strogatz . although being slightly different from the original watts - strogatz model , it is statistically equivalent and suitable for analytical investigations .",
    "the initial condition of our model consists of a ring with @xmath0 vertices , and each vertex has degree @xmath34 by having a single link to its @xmath35 next - neighbors as in watts - strogatz model .",
    "the model has , therefore , @xmath36 edges with total degree @xmath37 .",
    "the dynamics obeys the following scheme :    \\(i ) an edge end is chosen with uniform probability @xmath38 .",
    "\\(ii ) this extremity is reconnected with probability @xmath39 ( and kept without reconnection with probability @xmath40 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) back to ( i ) ( repetition for a fixed number of iterations ) .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath3 of a vertex @xmath4 having degree @xmath5 at time @xmath6 obeys the discrete time recurrent equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the discrete - time transition rate ( conditional probability ) from the state of degree @xmath14 to degree @xmath5 , as in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , the initial condition is @xmath43    consider now a vertex @xmath4 at time @xmath6 ; it can have degree @xmath5 at time @xmath44 in the following scenarios :    \\i ) the vertex @xmath4 has degree @xmath45 at time @xmath6 and degree @xmath5 at time @xmath44 : an edge - end , which is not connected to @xmath4 , is chosen with probability @xmath46 .",

    "one has a interval of @xmath39 where the system displays high clustering and low mean shortest path length , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 : clustering @xmath58 and shortest path length @xmath59 ( normalized by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ) of the graph generated by the dynamics of section [ tdws ] .",
    "the parameters are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 realizations of the simulations ; the error bars are smaller than the size of the points",
    ".    the time - dependent degree distribution can be evaluated iteratively from the recurrent equation ( [ me ] ) and ( [ pkt ] ) , and this allows one to compute the entropy @xmath66 of the model , which is shown in figure 3 .",
    "figure 3 : entropy of the time - dependent watts - strogatz model for @xmath32 , @xmath67 and @xmath33 .",
    "the entropy starts from a low value , as expected since the initial condition of watts - strogatz model is a regular lattice with @xmath68 .",
    "the entropy , then , grows with time , but reaches a constant value : differently from the erds - rnyi model , the watts - strogatz graph has no new connection being added , and the system converges to a stationary degree distribution different from a kronecker - delta - like as in the erds - rnyi case .",
    "introducing , again , the z - transform ( [ z ] ) to the recurrent equation of the time - dependent degree distribution obtained by combining ( [ me ] ) and ( [ pkt ] ) , one has @xmath69 where the initial condition @xmath70 stands for each vertex having exactly @xmath34 connections .",
    "the explicit form of the operator @xmath71 , which acts on this polynomial , will be presented in the next section . for",
    "now , it is sufficient to state that the analytical form of the time - dependent degree distribution is not well explored in the literature .",
    "this section is devoted to develop the arguments that will establish analytic results concerning the time - dependent degree distribution of the two models above .",
    "the erds - rnyi case will support and illustrate our arguments , since its a simpler laboratory and the exact form ( [ pkt_er ] ) is already known .      as seen in section [ tder ] ,",
    "the time - dependent degree distribution @xmath23 is the coefficient of the @xmath24-term in @xmath72 , as one can see from ( [ z ] ) .",
    "moreover , from ( [ phiphi0 ] ) and @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 .",
    "this means that one should search for the @xmath24-term of a polynomial resulted from the application of @xmath75 for @xmath6 times on @xmath76 .",
    "the operator @xmath75 , however , can be divided into a sum of three operators , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this separation is convenient , since when these operators are applied on a monomial @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , one has the following behavior : @xmath82 hence , starting from degree @xmath83 , one can see the procedure of applying @xmath6 times the operator @xmath84 as follows . since @xmath85 the @xmath24-term is a sum of many terms , each of them a product of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "let us consider @xmath86 as an example ; in this case , the @xmath87-term of @xmath88 is @xmath89 and this is @xmath90 . in the first term ,",
    "the system remains with degree zero at time @xmath91 and increases two unities at @xmath92 ; similar interpretation can be made for the second and third terms .",
    "the time - dependent degree distribution is , therefore , a sum of all trajectories , which are random walks in degree space ( see figure 4 ) , that leads @xmath93 at @xmath1 to degree @xmath5 at time @xmath6 . at each time step",
    ", the degree can increase one unity , or two unities , or stay constant with probabilities @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively ( note that @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) .",
    "hence , denoting by @xmath99 the degree at time @xmath14 , it is straightforward that @xmath100 where @xmath101 for @xmath102 and the first two kronecker deltas refer to the initial and final conditions ; each term inside the parenthesis indicates if the degree at time @xmath14 remains constant or increases ( with one or two unities ) when compared to the degree at the previous instant , @xmath103 .",
    "figure 4 : three examples of possible evolution of the degree ( these examples do not apply for the erds - rnyi model , where the degree never decreses ) . the initial and final degrees should be @xmath34 and @xmath5 , respectively .    the continuous version of ( [ er_rw ] ) is a path - integral formulation of the problem .",
    "nevertheless , it does not lead to an expression that can be trivially tackled by the usual methods .",
    "the time - dependent degree distribution can be evaluated explicitely by exploring the property that @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are @xmath104-numbers . during the time interval @xmath6",
    ", there should be @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 terms of @xmath96 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 . therefore ,",
    "@xmath110 which yields the same result of ( [ pkt_er ] ) , as expected . in ( [ er_step ] ) , @xmath111 is the largest integer equal or less than @xmath112 , and the last equality can be shown after a lengthy induction argument .    finally , one can also restate the recurrent equation @xmath113 as @xmath114 , where now we have two types of operators , @xmath115 that act for an interval of time equal to @xmath116 on the initial condition .",
    "similarly as in the previous case , the time - dependent watts - strogatz degree distribution is the @xmath24-term of @xmath117 , where now the initial condition is @xmath70 and @xmath118 with @xmath119 the form of these operators , which are not @xmath104-numbers anymore , can be deduced by ( [ w(k|k-1 ) ] ) , ( [ w(k|k+1 ) ] ) , ( [ w(k|k ) ] ) and the z - transform of ( [ me ] ) .",
    "when these operators are applied on a polynomial of degree @xmath14 , one has @xmath120 with @xmath121 note that now the coefficients @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are not constants and the operators @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 do not commute as in erds - rnyi case .",
    "following the same argument that has led to ( [ er_rw ] ) , we have @xmath128 for the watts - strogatz model .",
    "the degree starts with @xmath129 at time @xmath1 and ends with @xmath130 at time @xmath6 . between these boundaries ,",
    "the variable @xmath99 performs a random walk .",
    "this expression is not analytically treatable , and we will invoke some simplifications , which consist of choosing the dominant contributions ( paths ) to @xmath23 .      in this section , we will concentrate on the dominant contributions to the degree distribution @xmath23 .",
    "this follows by choosing a class of paths that starts at @xmath129 and ends at @xmath130 . by noticing that @xmath131 , the dominant contributions come from terms that maximize the number of @xmath122-factors",
    "this implies minimizing the number of @xmath123-factors or @xmath124-factors such that they should appear only to change the degree from @xmath34 to @xmath5 . in other terms",
    ", we have @xmath132 terms of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) type if @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , and the remaining @xmath135 terms are of @xmath122 type . note that these are monotonic paths in the sense that the degree only increases ( if @xmath133 ) or decreases ( if @xmath134 ) .",
    "let us consider initially , the case @xmath136 .",
    "writing the sum of all monotonic paths as being equal to the time - dependent degree distribution leads to @xmath137 the @xmath123 terms are functions of the degree @xmath99 ( see equation ( [ bad ] ) ) , and not on the instant they appear . in the monotonic crescent path , therefore , each term , @xmath138 should appear one and only one time in this order .",
    "the remaining @xmath139 segments of the path are filled by @xmath122-terms , and there should be @xmath140 of them that are @xmath141 , @xmath105 of them that are @xmath142 , and so on ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "firstly it is immediate from ( [ bad ] ) that @xmath143        figure 5 : increasing monotonic paths .",
    "all the monotonic paths , when @xmath133 , are located inside the envelope defined by the dashed lines .",

    "the reason for this statement comes from a simple analysis of the order of magnitude of the paths . remembering that @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , a monotonic path is @xmath163 , while there are @xmath164 of them .",
    "the first correction is due terms that have a @xmath123 and @xmath124 terms more than the monotonic paths terms ( and two @xmath122 terms less ) .",

    "the contribution of the first correction is roughly @xmath167 times the contribution of the monotonic paths .",
    "this argument can be extended to corrections of all orders .",
