    "one of the most recent surprises in particle physics came from the results of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , indicating that hadronic matter at temperatures slightly above the crossover critical temperature , @xmath0 , may be a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "naive expectations pointed towards a free gas of quarks and gluons or quasi - particles , a picture that can be understood from perturbative calculations of thermodynamic quantities such as the equation of state .",
    "these perturbative methods fail , however , at low temperatures , close to @xmath0 , where lattice qcd simulations are employed instead .",
    "although the underlying dynamical picture is difficult to infer from these numerical results , the findings at rhic are in qualitative agreement with the @xmath1 departure from the ideal gas , steffan - boltzmann law , predicted from lattice ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this departure is indeed very close to the exact @xmath2 value found from ads / cft , which is rigorously valid at infinite coupling ( see igor klebanov s article in this volume @xcite ) .",
    "several observable consequences of the creation of this new state of matter are measured at rhic as probes to characterize its properties . among them , we focus in the present article in the supression of the inclusive cross - section at large transverse momentum , @xmath3 , so - called _",
    "jet quenching_. in the absence of any nuclear effect , the cross section to produce a particle with high transverse momentum in heavy ion collisions should scale with the number of elementary interactions .",
    "however , a strong supression is found experimentally , the resulting particle production being about 20@xmath4 of the expected value .",
    "this dramatic departure from the naive expectation can be understood as being due to the energy loss of highly energetic partons traversing the medium created by the collision ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "another interesting observation in the high-@xmath3 region of the spectrum is a supression in the observed back - to - back high-@xmath3 jets in au+au vs. p+p collisions .",
    "quarks or gluons are produced predominantly in pairs in elementary , hard collisions , flying in opposite directions in the transverse plane .",
    "correlation of azimuthal angles among high-@xmath3 particles produced in the same event is measured . in the absence of any final state effect ,",
    "one is led to expect a peak at @xmath5 for partners in the same jet as the trigger parton , and a recoil peak at @xmath6 .",
    "these back - to - back jets are indeed observed in p+p and d+au collisions . in central au+au collisions , though , the recoil jet is greatly distorted ( absent ) indicating large final state effects on the produced hard quarks and gluons due to the resulting medium .",
    "the observed deficit of high energy jets seems to be the result of a slowing down , damping or quenching of the most energetic partons as they propagate through the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )",
    ". the rate of energy loss should be spectacular : several gev per fm , more than one order of magnitude larger than in cold nuclear matter .",
    "the energy loss of a hard parton in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) can be parameterized through the transport coefficient known as @xmath7 .",
    "if defined at weak coupling , it would measure the average square transverse momentum transferred to the hard parton per mean free path length .",
    "fitting the current data it seems that , with a great degree of confidence , its measured value is generously within the range @xmath8 all estimates for this quantity in weak coupling computations lead to much lower values , @xmath9 , with a prefactor of order one which depends on the assumptions in the calculation , this leading to @xmath10 gev@xmath11/fm ( see e.g. @xcite ) . ] and the obvious question is whether a calculation at strong coupling could result in better agreement .",
    "lattice techniques are not well suited to study this kind of phenomenon as it involves real - time dynamics which is fairly difficult to address in a euclidean time formulation . under these conditions",
    ", the use of ads / cft provides a powerful tool to study this type of physics , providing both valuable insights into the physical aspects of the underlying mechanism of energy loss , as well as on the applicability of these techniques to actual experimental situations .",
    "the calculation of the jet quenching parameter is not the only example of this novel connection : attempts to compute quantities in ads / cft which could be of interest for the physics of heavy ion collisions are currently abundant .",
    "one of the greatest successes of this approach is the computation of the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density @xcite , @xmath12 , which agrees with current fits of hydrodynamical models to rhic data on the elliptic flow ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other examples are the computation of thermodynamical quantities such as the free energy , the energy density , the heat capacity , the speed of sound , etc .",
    "further calculations within the ads / cft framework aiming at providing a bridge towards experimental data include the drag force coefficient , the relaxation time , diffusion constants , thermal spectral functions , stability of heavy - quark bound states , and the hydrodynamical behavior of the collision .",
    "in order to study the jet quenching phenomenon , we must first provide an appropriate phenomenological description of the relevant physics .",
    "the original formulation of the induced emission by an extended medium goes back to the early fifties , when landau and pomeranchuk gave a framework in which to consider a charged particle moving through a classical electrodynamical environment @xcite , and generalized shortly after to the quantum case by migdal @xcite .",
    "these results were extended to the case of qcd by gyulassy , plumer and wang @xcite , zakharov @xcite and by baier , dokshitzer , mueller , peign and schiff @xcite .",
    "let us briefly present the basics of medium induced gluon radiation for a highly energetic parton .",
    "a quark with energy @xmath13 emits a gluon with a fraction of momentum @xmath14 and transverse momentum with respect to the quark direction @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction of this system is depicted by multiple scatterings with the medium which , in some models , can be considered as a collection of static scattering centers . in the eikonal approximation ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "the particle trajectories can be written as wilson lines in the light - cone coordinate . using the approximation above",
    ", the quark is seen as traveling in a straight line while the gluon is allowed to move in transverse space by interaction with the medium . in the multiple soft scattering approximation , the transverse position of",
    "the gluon follows a brownian motion , and the average transverse momentum after traveling a distance @xmath17 is characterized by the transport coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "the origin of this parameter and the relation with the wilson lines can be understood as follows : in order to compute the cross - section for gluon emission , a wilson line ending at transverse position @xmath19 appears in the amplitude corresponding to the gluon propagation , together with another wilson line for the gluon in the conjugate amplitude , at transverse position @xmath20 .",
    "these wilson lines then need to be averaged over all possible medium configurations , appearing only in combinations like @xcite @xmath21 ~. \\label{eq : average}\\ ] ] this approximation is valid , up to logarithmic corrections , in the small distance limit @xmath22 .",
    "the average @xmath23 and the corresponding medium properties are all encoded in a single jet quenching parameter , @xmath7 .",
    "when the medium does not vary along the light - cone trajectory of the gluon ) , and interpret @xmath7 as a properly weighted average measure of the time dependent transport coefficient .",

    "the wilson loop computation leading to the jet quenching parameter can be readily performed , at large @xmath27 , within the framework of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it amounts to the evaluation of the ( regularized ) nambu  goto action , @xmath28 , for a string hanging from the curve @xmath29 at the boundary towards the bulk of ads , @xmath30 + { \\cal o } \\left ( 1/n_c \\right ) ~. \\label{wilson}\\ ] ] let us succintly cover the basics of this computation .",
    "the family of black brane metrics of interest for us have the following form @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "we shall use light - cone coordinates @xmath33 , and consider a rectangular wilson loop @xmath29 parameterized by the embedding @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 , and  @xmath36 . for a symmetric configuration around @xmath37 , @xmath38 ,",
    "the nambu - goto action takes the following form @xmath39 @xmath40 being the inverse of the string tension .",
    "the energy is a first integral of motion , from which the profile @xmath41 can be extracted by inverting @xmath42 @xmath43 is an integration constant fixed by the relation @xmath44 .",
    "it is more convenient to deal with a dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the location of the black brane horizon , and perform the rescalings , @xmath47 @xmath48 being the t hooft coupling in the dual ( @xmath49)-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "@xmath17 is inversely proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we have to explore the limit @xmath50 , and keep the leading term in @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the action has to be regularized by substracting the nambu - goto action for a pair of wilson lines that stretch straight from the boundary to the horizon .",
    "therefore , the jet quenching parameter finally reads @xcite : @xmath52 this remarkably compact formula is valid for a vast family of gauge / gravity duals , some of which will be presently explored .",
    "as it stands , it calls for a translation of gravity parameters in terms of the field theoretical quantities .",
    "this is provided by the ( nowadays standard ) ads / cft dictionary .      in this subsection",
    "we would like to review some of the quantum field theories for whose plasmas the jet quenching parameter has been computed . in order to provide some numbers , we consider as a representative choice of average values , @xmath53 ( that is , @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 mev .",
    "this is , of course , a crude simplification for several reasons : the real @xmath7 varies with time and , moreover , it is hard to provide both a reliable dependence of the coupling on the temperature , @xmath56 , as well as to choose a representative average value for these quantities .",
    "thus , numbers should be taken as indicative .",
    "the original computation in the ads / cft framework , performed by liu , rajagopal and wiedemann @xcite for @xmath57 super yang  mills theory , gives @xmath58 notice that , contrary to what happens at weak coupling @xcite , it does not depend explicitly on the number of degrees of freedom .",

    "the jet quenching computation in this case proceeds as before @xcite , the only difference being at the last step where the relation between the radius of the manifold and the t hooft coupling depends on the volume of x@xmath79 which , in turn , is inversely proportional to the central charge of the gauge theory @xcite , @xmath80 for the prototypical case , x@xmath79 @xmath81 t@xmath82 , _ i.e. _ the klebanov  witten ( kw ) model , this equation implies @xmath83 gev@xmath11/fm . a mild version of this result can be extended to further superconformal field theories and , in particular , implies that if two such theories are connected by a renormalization group flow , then @xmath7 for the ultraviolet ( uv ) theory is always larger than that for the infrared ( ir ) theory @xcite .",

    "a detailed study of this behavior was recently performed in @xcite , where it was shown that the enhancement could be as high as 30@xmath4 of the @xmath86 value .",
    "these two examples suggest that breaking of conformal invariance might be associated to an increase of the jet quenching parameter .",
    "quarks are prime ingredients of qcd . up to this point",
    ", however , we have misleadingly used the acronym qgp for theories without quarks .",
    "this is quite generic in the literature since gravity duals including quantum field theoretical degrees of freedom in the fundamental representation of the gauge group are scarce .",
    "a notable exception is given by the case of quenched flavor , @xmath87 , in which quarks can be represented by probe d  branes in the background sourced by a large number of color branes @xcite .",

    "the optimistic prejudice , driven by the unexpected success of bottom - up approaches like the alluded to ads / qcd , is that the non - critical solutions might capture at least qualitative information of the dual field theories , insensitive to these corrections .",

    "it is not clear , thus , if these solutions provide reliable descriptions of 4d finite temperature gauge / gravity duals .",
    "while the energy loss of a probe quark due to drag force in the plasma @xcite is found to be non - zero ( and formally analogous to the @xmath105 sym theory case ) , the jet quenching parameter exactly vanishes .",
    "these quantities are related to the energy loss of a parton in two opposite regimes of the transverse momentum ( large momentum for the quenching parameter and small momentum for the drag coefficient ) .",
    "still , obtaining such completely different results is puzzling .",
    "the jet quenching parameter is definitely dependent on the uv behavior of the dual backgrounds , and so on the 6d lst asymptotics , while the same dependence for the drag force is not apparent .",
    "this fact suggests that the result @xmath106 has to be associated more to non - local lst modes than to their claimed local counterparts .",
    "these give total screening and , as a consequence , zero jet quenching parameter .",
    "thus , these backgrounds do not seem to be useful in order to study uv properties of realistic plasmas .",

    "interestingly , the hydrodynamic properties of the qgp are not affected by the troublesome thermodynamic behavior mentioned above .",
