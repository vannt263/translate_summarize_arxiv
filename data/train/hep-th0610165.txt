    "the picture is absolutely different for non - solitonic boson stars , @xcite , where gravity and not the scalar potential is the main stabilizing factor .",

    "below @xmath130 the energy of the free particles ( identified with the particle number for @xmath131 ) is less than the soliton energy , which means that the decay into free particles is energetically favorable .",
