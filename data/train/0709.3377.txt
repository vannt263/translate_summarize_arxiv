    "there has been much recent interest in the study of causality based on graphs , e.g. @xcite . a most common scenario studied",
    "is when the observer collects data from a system and wants to make inferences about what would happen were she to control the system , for example by imposing a new treatment regime . to make prediction with such data she needs to hypothesize a certain causal mechanism which not only describes the data generating process , but also governs what might happen",
    "were she to control the system .",
    "pioneering work by two different groups of authors @xcite have used a graphical framework called a causal bayesian network ( cbn ) .",
    "their work is based on bayesian networks ( bn ) which is a compact framework for representing certain collections of conditional independence statements .",
    "algebraic geometry and computational commutative algebra have been successfully employed to address identifiability issues @xcite and to understand the properties of the learning mechanisms @xcite behind bn s .",
    "a key point was the understanding that collections of conditional independence relations on discrete random variables expressed in a suitable parametrization are polynomials and have a close link with toric varieties @xcite .",
    "further related work showed that pairwise independence and global independence are expressed through toric ideals @xcite and that gaussian bn s are related to classical constructions in algebraic geometry e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this paper we observe that when model representations and causal hypotheses are expressed as a set of maps from one semi - algebraic space to another , then ideas of causality are separated from the classes of graphical models .",
    "this allows us to generalise straightforwardly concepts of graphical causality as defined in e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.2.1 ) to non - graphical model classes .",
    "many classes of models including context specific bn s @xcite , bayes linear constraint models ( blc s ) @xcite and chain event graphs ( ceg s ) @xcite are special cases of this algebraic formulation .",
    "causal hypotheses are most naturally expressed in terms of two types of hypotheses .",
    "the first type concerns when and how circumstances might unfold .",
    "this provides us with a hypothesized partial order which can be reflected by the parametrization of the joint probability mass function of the idle system .",
    "the second type of hypotheses concerns structural assertions about the uncontrolled system that , we assume , also apply in the controlled system .",
    "these are usually expressible as semi - algebraic constraints in the given parametrization . under these two types of hypotheses",
    "the mass function of the manipulated system is defined as a projection of the mass function of the uncontrolled system , in total analogy to cbn s .",
    "the combination of the partial order and of these constraint equations and inequalities enables the use of various useful algebraic methodologies for the investigation of the properties of large classes of discrete inferential models and of their causal extensions .",
    "the main observation of the paper is that a ( discrete ) causal model can be redefined directly and very flexibly using an algebraic representation starting from a finite set of unfolding events and a description of a way they succeed one another .",
    "this is shown through model classes of increasing generality .",
    "first in section [ section2 ] we review the popular class of discrete bn models , our simplest class , their related factorization formulae under a preferred parametrisation , and their causal extensions .",
    "then we extrapolate the algebraic features of bn and give their formalisation in section  [ section3 ] in a rather general context . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we show how this formalization can apply to more general classes of models than bn s , so that identifiability and feasibility issues can be addressed . here",
    "we describe causal models based on trees in section [ sectiontree ] and the most general model class we consider is in section [ extreme ] .",
    "the issues are illustrated throughout by a typical albeit simple model for the study of the causal effects of violence of men who might watch a violent movie , introduced in section [ section2violent ] to outline some limitations of the framework of the bn for examining causal hypotheses , which , we believe , currently is the best framework to represent causal hypotheses . in section [ section4.1 ]",
    "we are able to express these limitations within an algebraic setting .",
    "the discrete bn is a powerful framework to describe hypotheses an observer might make about a particular system .",
    "it consists of a directed acyclic graph with @xmath0 nodes and of a set of probabilistic statements .",
    "it implicitly assumes that the features of main interest in a statistical model can be expressed in the following terms .    * the observer s beliefs as expressed through the graph concern statements about relationships between a prescribed set of measurements @xmath1 taking values @xmath2 in a product space @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a random variable that takes values in @xmath5 , @xmath6 . for @xmath6",
    "let @xmath7 be the cardinality of @xmath8 , @xmath9 be finite and @xmath10 take value on the set of integers @xmath11 , henceforth indicated as @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "then the joint sample space @xmath13 contains @xmath14 distinct points . *",
    "the sets of relationships most easily read out of the graph , are consistent with a partial order @xmath15 on @xmath16 implied by the graph itself .",
    "historically this order was often chosen so that if @xmath17 then @xmath18 in some rather loose mechanistic sense , although this is certainly not a necessary interpretation of the order . in this case",
    "we will call the bn _",
    "regular_. henceforth we will assume a regular bn . *",
    "the graph expresses the @xmath19 conditional independence statements @xmath20 where @xmath21 is called the _",
    "parents _ of @xmath4 . for a definition",
    "see @xcite . for @xmath22 , in some sense the values the random variables in @xmath21 take , embody all relevant probabilistic information concerning @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore for regular bn s @xmath21 can be interpreted as the set of variables in @xmath23 relevant to the potential development of @xmath4 .",
    "the last property enables the entire set of beliefs to be expressed by a single directed acyclic graph called a bn .",
    "its vertex set is the set of measurement variables @xmath24 and there is an edges from @xmath25 to @xmath4 if and only if @xmath26 . the implicit partial order induced by this direct graph and its loose link to the order of how circumstances unfold , has encouraged various authors to extend the model to one that also makes statements about relationships between the same set of measurements when they have been subjected to various controls , e.g. @xcite . before discussing this point , we consider an example to underline some specific features .",
    "consider a statistical model built to study whether watching a violent movie might induce a man into a fight , allowing for testosterone levels to , at least partially , explain a violent behaviour .",
    "let @xmath27 denote whether a man watches a violent movie early one evening @xmath28 or not @xmath29 and let @xmath30 be an indicator of whether he is arrested for fighting @xmath31 or not @xmath32 late that evening .",
    "if he watches the movie , let @xmath33 denote his testosterone level just before seeing it and @xmath34 his testosterone level late that evening .",
    "for a man who does not watch the movie let @xmath35 denote his testosterone level that evening .",
    "assume @xmath36 and @xmath37 take three values : @xmath38 for low levels of testosterone , @xmath39 for medium levels and @xmath40 for high levels , so that @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ". then this can be depicted as the following bn @xmath43 the graph of this bn embodies two substantive statements .",
    "the first one , @xmath44 is associated with the missing edge from @xmath33 to @xmath27 and states that whether the man watched the movie would not depend on his testosterone level .",
    "the second one @xmath45 is associated with the missing edge from @xmath33 to @xmath30 and states that the testosterone level before watching the movie gives no additional relevant information about the man s inclination to violence provided that we happen to know both whether he watched the movie and his current testosterone levels .",
    "it will be useful later to note that the edge @xmath46 indicates that watching a violent movie might help cause the fight by increasing testosterone levels , while the edge @xmath47 indicates that it might do so by some other mechanism .",
    "an alternative semi - algebraic representation of this statistical model is given as follows .",
    "for each of the @xmath42 levels @xmath48 let @xmath49 be the joint mass function associated with the bn .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume @xmath50 strictly positive for each @xmath51 .",
    "an obvious inequality constraint is given by the fact that the vector @xmath52 lies in the standard simplex @xmath53    the bn suggests the partial order on the variables for which @xmath36 and @xmath54 precede @xmath37 which precedes @xmath55 .",
    "a natural , not unique , parametrization is , then , determined by the total ordered sequence @xmath56 and has 63 parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . call the indeterminates @xmath61 _ primitive probabilities _ , for @xmath62 .",
    "sum - to - one constraint like @xmath63 gives 28 linear constraints to be coupled with the positivity assumption .",
    "a general joint mass function on @xmath64 is given by the 36 quartic equations @xmath65 this is a particular form of the general factorisation of the joint mass function with respect to a bn @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the value taken by the random vector @xmath21 when @xmath70 .",
    "the conditional independence statements in the bn are given by a finite set of linear equations in primitive probabilities @xmath71 for all @xmath72 .",
    "see @xcite for a proof and a discussion of this . the statistical model expressed by the bn",
    "is then given as a semi - algebraic set defined by polynomial equations and inequalities in the primitive probabilities .",
    "furthermore the simple substitution of equations ( [ bneqs ] ) into ( [ bnfactes ] ) allows us to reduces the number of parameters and of constraints .",
    "indeed the resulting vectors @xmath73 lie in @xmath74 as do each of the vectors @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 whilst the vectors @xmath78 and each of the vectors @xmath79 for @xmath77 and @xmath80 lies in @xmath81 .",
    "each of the 14 simplices also embodies a linear constraint through its sum - to - one condition making the interior of the domain a 21 dimensional linear manifold .",
    "a critical point to notice for the generalisations that follow is that each of the @xmath82 simplices @xmath83 is labelled by a particular configuration of @xmath84 . in a bn",
    "each such configuration of parents labels and distinguishes a possible history of circumstances and might influence the probabilistic development of the network .",
    "it is common for a statistical model to contain as its substantive hypotheses more than the conditional independence statements , expressible in a bn .",
    "often such additional non - graphical hypotheses can be expressed as a set of algebraic equations or inequalities on the primitive probabilities .",
    "we list a few such additional hypothesis for our example .    *",
    "if the movie is not watched then we would expect @xmath85 , equivalently @xmath86 * if a unit did watch the movie , we would not expect this to reduce his testosterone level .",
    "this sets some of the primitive probabilities to zero , namely @xmath87 * the assumption that the higher the prior testosterone levels the higher the posterior ones , is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 are additional semi parametric parameters .",
    "* similarly it is reasonable to expect that higher levels of testosterone together with having seen the movie would make more probable that a man would be arrested for fighting .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath90 for @xmath80 and for @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath94 , similarly to the previous bullet point . *",
    "finally a common simple log - linear response model might assume @xmath95 .",
    "the point here is not that these supplementary equations and inequalities provide the most compelling model , but rather that embellishments of this type , whilst not graphical , are common , are easily expressed in the primitive probability parametrization , and often have an almost identical type of algebraic description as the bn .    in general",
    "then , a bn is a collection of monomials in primitive probabilities and the @xmath50 parameters .",
    "it is defined through a total order of variables in the example equations ( [ bnfactes]) supplemented by the set of linear equations on the primitive probabilities @xmath96 whenever @xmath97 and @xmath98 take the same value on @xmath99 @xmath100 . in the example",
    "these are equations ( [ bneqs ] ) .",
    "more detailed types of model specification are given by the saturated model , e.g. equations ( [ bnfactes ] ) , supplemented by further algebraic and semi - algebraic equations analogous to equations ( [ bneqs ] ) and to those in the bullet points above .",
    "so a strong case can be made for _ starting _ with this class of algebraic description and relegating the graphical formulation as a useful depiction of a particular subclass of these structures .",
    "the bn has other associated factorization formulae based on its clique structure , see e.g. @xcite , that are more symmetric and have been used as a vehicle for a different algebraic formulation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in fact it is often elegant to express this discrete model in terms of its natural exponential parametrization @xcite .",
    "however for causal models the partial order on the @xmath4 s given by the topology of the bn and hence the associated factorization of the joint mass function is critical to the definition of the predicted effect of manipulating the system : see below . in causal modelling",
    "we have therefore found it to be more expedient to parametrize a model directly through conditional probabilities chosen so they are consistent with such a causal partial order . under the parametrization given by these primitive probabilities",
    ", a bn can be thought of as a labelling of a collection of simplices about what might happen ( the value a node random variable might take ) , given the relevant past ( the particular configuration of values taken by its parents ) .",
    "typically it is required to infer the value of a vector @xmath101 .",
    "if we are interested in the whole joint mass function , @xmath102 is the identity .",
    "often @xmath102 is a polynomial or a rational polynomial function in the primitive probabilities .",
    "obviously such inference would be trivial if we could learn the full probability table @xmath103 .",
    "however usually only variables in a subset @xmath104 of @xmath105 are measured in a particular population , sometimes over a very large sample of individuals .",
    "the random variables in @xmath104 are called _ manifest _ and those in @xmath106 are called _",
    "almost always we can learn only the values of the polynomials @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a sub - vector of @xmath51 involving only values of the manifest random variables .",
    "for the example in section [ section2violent ] it may be impossible to determine the testosterone levels @xmath109 of the individuals in any sample , but only @xmath110 .",
    "if we ignore the positivity conditions , this is a newtonian problem in albeit real algebraic geometry and so solvable through techniques like elimination theory .",
    "indeed when @xmath102 is the identity these identifiability questions are now answered for many small bn s by using elimination techniques .",
    "see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for examples from the field of computational biology .",
    "often the study of identifiability issues after observing the manifest margins ( [ man1 ] ) has been driven more by the semantics of the graph of a bn where a full node of the graph represents a hidden _ variable_/measurement .",
    "however in practice missingness of data is often contingent on what has happened to a unit , i.e. the particular _ value _ its parent configuration takes and not the whole variable .    to illustrate this point consider collecting data for the example in section [ section2violent ] when @xmath55 is hidden and it is the variable of central interest with its associated probabilities @xmath111 .",
    "it might be possible to randomly sample men and measure their testosterone levels before and after watching a violent movie . call this experiment 1 .",
    "however if it were seriously believed that watching a violent movie might induce a fight , it would be unethical to release the subjects after watching the movie , while any therapy either in the form of drugs or counselling will corrupt the experiment . in any case recording the proportions of subjects who later fought",
    "would not give an appropriate estimate of probabilities associated with @xmath30 and conditional on its parents .",
    "so values like @xmath112 can not be estimated from such samples . to identify the system we therefore need to supplement this type of experiment with another measuring willingness to fight .",
    "other experiments might be envisaged leading to analogues problems .",
    "partial information about the joint distribution of @xmath30 with other variables might be obtained from a random sample of men arrested for fighting @xmath31 .",
    "their current testosterone levels @xmath34 and whether they had recently watched a violent movie @xmath27 could be measured .",
    "but we could not measure @xmath46 for men that are not caught fighting .",
    "thus the finest partition of probabilities we could hope for in a population under this kind of survey is based on the sample space partition @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 i.e. @xmath116 and for @xmath77 and @xmath117 @xmath118 .",
    "call this experiment  2 .    the algebraic expression of the observations from this second experiment are analogous to equations ( [ man1 ] ) , being sums of the probabilities on the atoms of the joint mass function , but they are not of the same form because manifest equations do not correspond to marginal constraints .",
    "nevertheless the types of elimination techniques applicable to bn can clearly still be employed to determine the geometry and properties of its solution spaces .",
    "so the pattern of missing data encountered often have an algebraic but not a graphical representation .",
    "as already mentioned , the regular bn in section [ section2violent ] could be hypothesised to be causal following many authors e.g. @xcite . here",
    "the term `` cause '' has a very specific meaning and the causal structure is conventionally associated to the partial order of the graph in a regular bn .",
    "a formal definition is given in the next section .",
    "see also ( * ? ? ? * equation ( 3.10 ) ) .",
    "first we discuss some key points .    asserting that the bn in section [ section2violent ] is a cbn implies that since @xmath119 and @xmath120 we believe @xmath33 and @xmath27 are potential causes of @xmath34 .",
    "this means that if the prior level of testosterone @xmath33 were to be controlled to take the value @xmath121 and the man were _ made _ to watch the film ( or not to ) , then the probability he had a testosterone value @xmath122 would be the same as the proportion of times @xmath122 was observed to occur in the uncontrolled ( infinite ) population with observed values @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 if he was forced not to watch the movie ) .",
    "similarly , a causal interpretation of this bn would also assert that the effect on the probability the man would fight @xmath126 if we forced @xmath127 would be identified with @xmath128 , i.e. the corresponding conditional probability in the uncontrolled system .",
    "furthermore , forcing a variable to take a value @xmath129 will have no effect on the joint distribution of the variables which do not follow @xmath4 in the causal partial order .",
    "for example increasing the testosterone level @xmath34 would have no effect on the joint probability of @xmath130 .",
    "obviously a cbn makes stronger statements than a bn with the same graph .",
    "as in the example above the extra modelling statements made in a cbn are often plausible and gives us a framework within which to make predictions about the observed system were it to be subject to certain controls .",
    "for example we might want to consider the potential effect of    1 .   banning the film , thus preventing it from being viewed by the general public ( force @xmath131 ) or 2 .   imposing a treatment on the population for reducing testosterone levels so that they are always low ( force @xmath132 ) , e.g. in an enclosed population like a prison .",
    "it is easily checked that the predicted potential effect of either of these controls under the cbn hypothesis is a plausible one .",
    "even when the idle system is only partially observed , the cbn hypotheses can enable us to estimate the probable effects of such controls simply from observing a random sample of men not subject either to a ban or a testosterone inhibiting treatment .",
    "the use of the cbn to express causal hypotheses has been successfully employed in many scenarios e.g. @xcite , while in others it is restrictive and implausible , as poignantly discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main problem is that causal orders are more naturally defined as refinements of a partial order on circumstances in a bn represented by particular configurations of parents than on sets of measurements .",
    "again we will use the example in section [ section2violent ] to demonstrate this . for fuller examples",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we will omit any discussion of the important issue of exactly how we intend to enact the control of a measurement to a particular value .    in the example",
    "the partial order on the nodes of the bn is @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "but note that , in our statement of the problem , if the man watches the movie then by definition @xmath35 . under this definition ,",
    "manipulating @xmath34 and leaving @xmath33 unaffected , as would be required by the cbn , is not possible .",
    "if we follow the two different types of unfoldings of history : \\{prior testosterone level @xmath135 , watch movie , @xmath136 posterior testosterone level @xmath137 , arrested @xmath138 } and \\{prior testosterone level @xmath135 , do nt watch movie , @xmath131 , arrested @xmath139 } this sort of ambiguity disappears and we could reasonably conjecture that these unfoldings are consistent with their `` causal order '' .",
    "this might be expressed by the two context specific graphs below @xmath140 the joint mass function is no longer defined on the product space @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "however the joint mass function of each of these possible unfoldings is well defined and furthermore each unfolding is expressible as a monomial in the primitive probabilities .",
    "note that the class of monomials for the right - hand graph is of order one less than the left - hand one .",
    "many other common problems exist for which the cbn can not express a hypothesized causal mechanism whilst algebraic representations allows this @xcite .",
    "we start by fixing some notation and reviewing some known results . for a positive integer @xmath143 let @xmath144 be the @xmath145-standard simplex and @xmath146 the unit hypercube in @xmath147 . for a set @xmath148 ,",
    "let @xmath149 be its interior set in the euclidean topology .",
    "the set of all joint probability distributions on the @xmath0-dimensional random vector @xmath150 taking the @xmath151 values in @xmath13 , defined in section [ section2bn ] , is identified with the @xmath152 simplex simply by listing the probabilities of each value taken by the random vector @xmath153 where @xmath154 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that independence of the random variables in @xmath23 corresponds to the requirement that @xmath50 belongs to a segre variety in @xmath155 and that the naive bayes model corresponds to the higher secant varieties of segre varieties . while local and global independence in a bn are studied in @xcite .",
    "the most basic example , here , is that two binary random variables are independent if @xmath156 , the well known condition of zero determinant of the contingency table for @xmath33 and @xmath27 .",
    "there are various ways to map a simplex into a smaller dimensional simplex .",
    "some are relevant to statistics .",
    "sturmfels ( john van neumann lectures 2003 ) observes that , for @xmath157 $ ] , marginalisation over @xmath158 and @xmath159 gives a linear map which is a projection of convex polytopes .",
    "namely , @xmath160 where @xmath161,i\\in j^{c}}p(x_{1},\\ldots , x_{n})$ ] and analogously for @xmath162 .    here",
    "we compare the two operations of conditioning and manipulation .",

    "however when manipulations are considered it is legitimate to consider what might happen if we force the system so that events that would not happen in the unmanipulated system were made to happen in the manipulated system .",

    "it is the orthogonal projection from @xmath230 onto the face @xmath231 which is identified with the hypercube @xmath232 . in general , for a regular bn this is an orthogonal projection in the associated conditional parametrisation , which then seems the best parametrization in which to perform computations .",
    "the post manipulation joint mass function on @xmath233 is then @xmath234 which , factorised in primitive probabilities , gives a monomial of degree @xmath19 , one less than in equation ( [ bnfact ] ) . in this sense , under the conditional parametrization , the effect of a manipulation or control gives a much simpler algebraic map than the effect of conditioning .",
    "its formal definition depends only on the causal order , the second bullet point in section [ section2bn ] , and not on the probabilistic structured of the bn .",
    "in particular it does not depend on the homogeneity of the factorization of the joint mass function on @xmath23 across all settings .",
    "this observation allowed us to extend this notion to larger classes of discrete causal models .",
    "see @xcite and section [ section4 ] .",
    "identification problems associated with the estimation of some probabilities after manipulation from passive observations ( manifest variables measured in the idle system ) have been formulated as an elimination problem in computational commutative algebra .",
    "for example in the case of bn the case study in @xcite , giving a graphical application of the back - door theorem @xcite , has been replicated algebraically by matthias drton using the parametrization in primitive probabilities .",
    "ignacio ojeda addresses from an algebraic view point a different and more unusual identification problem in a causal bn with four nodes .",
    "he uses the @xmath50 parameters and the description of the bn as a toric ideal .",
    "both are personal communications at the workshop to which this volume is dedicated .    in general",
    ", a systematic implementation of these problems in computer algebra softwares will be slow to run . at times",
    "some pre - processing can be performed in order to exploit the symmetries and invariances to various group action for certain classes of statistical models @xcite .",
    "other times a re - parametrisation in terms of non - central moments loses an order of magnitude effect on the speed of computation @xcite and hence can be useful .",
    "nevertheless in this algebraic framework many non - graphically based symmetries which appear in common models are much easier to exploit than in a graphical setting .",
    "this suggests that the algebraic representation of causality is a promising way of computing the identifiability of a causal effect in much wider classes of models than bn .",
    "to recap :    1 .",
    "[ order ] a total order on @xmath235 and an associated multiplication rule as in equation ( [ multiplicationrule ] ) are fundamental .",
    "these determine a set of primitive probabilities ; 2 .",
    "[ studeny ] a discrete bn can be described through a set of linear equations equating primitive probabilities , equations ( [ bneqs ] ) , together with inequalities to express non negativity of probabilities and linear equations for the sum - to - one constraints ; 3 .",
    "a bn is based on the assumption that the factorization in equation ( [ bnfact ] ) holds across all values of @xmath51 in a cross product sample space .",
    "recall that in @xcite it is shown that identification depends on the sample space structure , in particular on the number of levels a variable takes ; 4 .   within a graphical framework subsets of whole variables in @xmath23",
    "are considered manifest or hidden ; 5 .   [ causalcontrol ]",
    "mainly the causal controls being studied in e.g. @xcite correspond to setting subsets of variables in @xmath23 to take particular values and often the effect of a cause is expressed as a polynomial function of the primitive probabilities , in particular the probability of a suitable marginal ; 6 .",
    "[ identpoint ] identification problems formulated in the graphical framework of a bn and intended as the writing of an effect of a cause in terms of manifest variables are basically elimination problems .",
    "hence they can be addressed using elimination theory from computational commutative algebra . in particular theorems like the front - door theorem and the back - door theorem",
    "are proved using clever algebraic eliminations , see @xcite .",
    "the above scheme can be modified in many directions to include non - graphical models and causal functions not expressible in a graphical framework , like those in section [ sectioncausal ] .",
    "identification problems can still be addressed with algebraic methods as in item [ identpoint ] above .",
    "an indispensable point for a causal interpretation of a model is a partial order either on @xmath23 or on @xmath141 , where the sample space may be generalised to be not of product form .",
    "a first generalisation is in @xcite where the authors substitute the binomials in item  [ studeny ] above with linear equations and the inequalities in item  [ order ] with inequalities between linear functions in the primitive probabilities .",
    "if there exists at least a probability distribution over @xmath23 satisfying this set of equations and inequalities then the model is called a feasible bayesian linear constraint model .",
    "of course a mere algebraic representation of a model will lose the expressiveness and interpretability associated with the compact topology of most graphical structures and hence to dispense completely with the graphical constraints might not always be advisable .",
    "but a combined use of a graphical representation and an algebraic one will certainly allow the formulation of more general model classes and will allow causality to benefit of computational and interpretative techniques of algebraic geometry as currently happens in computational biology @xcite . a causal model structure based on a single rooted tree and amenable of an algebraic formulation",
    "is studied in @xcite . in there , following @xcite the focus of the causal model is shifted from the factors in @xmath23 to the actual circumstances .",
    "each node of the tree represents a `` situation '' in the case of a bn a possible setting of the @xmath23 vector and the partial order intrinsic to the tree is consistent with the order in which we believe things can happen .",
    "this approach has many advantages , freeing us from the sorts of ambiguity discussed in section [ section2violent ] and allowing us to define simple causal controls that enact a particular policy _ only _ when conditions might require that control .",
    "assume a single rooted tree @xmath236 with vertex set @xmath237 and edge set @xmath238 .",
    "let @xmath239 be a generic edge from @xmath240 to @xmath241 and associate to @xmath242 a possibly unknown transition probabilities @xmath243 $ ] under the constraint @xmath244 , for all @xmath245 which are not leaf vertices .",
    "the set @xmath246 gives a parametrization of our model and the @xmath247 are called primitive probabilities .",
    "let @xmath248 be the set of root - to - leaf paths in @xmath249 and for @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the root vertex and @xmath252 a leaf vertex , define the polynomials @xmath253 in @xcite it is shown that @xmath254 is a probability space .",
    "the set of circumstances of interest is then represented by the nodes of the tree and the probabilistic events are given by the leaves of the tree , equivalently the root - to - leaf paths . here",
    "are three examples from the literature .",
    "once an order on @xmath23 has been chosen , a bn corresponds to a tree whose root - to - leaf paths have all the same length , @xmath255 and its independence structure is translated into equalities of some primitive probabilities @xcite .",
    "the basic saturated model individuated by the polynomials in equations ( [ treefact ] ) augmented with a set of algebraic equations in the elements of @xmath256 has been called algebraically constraint tree in @xcite . in @xcite a model based on a tree and called a chain event graph",
    "has now been developed and explored to some level of detail .",
    "there is a natural partial order associated with the tree which can be used as a framework to express causality : @xmath257 if there exists @xmath258 such that @xmath259 and @xmath240 lies closer to @xmath251 than @xmath260 .",
    "a tree is _ regular _ if in the problem we are modelling the circumstance represented by @xmath240 occurs before the one represented by @xmath260 whenever @xmath257 .",
    "the effects of a control on a regular tree @xmath261 can now be defined in total analogy to item [ causalcontrol ] above by modifying the values of some primitive probabilities or more generally by defining constraints in the primitive probabilities that have a causal interpretation .",
    "[ manipulation ] let @xmath262 be a regular tree and @xmath256 the associated primitive probabilities .",
    "a manipulation of the tree is given by a subset @xmath263 and an extra set of parameters associated to edges in @xmath189 , namely @xmath264 under the constraints @xmath265 for all @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "furthermore the @xmath268 are assumed to be functions of the primitive probabilities for all @xmath266 .",
    "for example in the typical manipulations in @xcite and in section [ section3.3 ] some @xmath268 are chosen equal to one and hence some others equal to zero . here",
    "we observe that definition [ manipulation ] translates into a map similar to the one discussed for bn s in section [ section3.3 ] .    to simplify notation let @xmath269 be the set of non leaf vertices in @xmath249 .",
    "for @xmath270 let @xmath271 and @xmath272 be the cardinality of @xmath273",
    ". then the saturated model on a tree is equivalent to the list of primitive probabilities @xmath274 together with the semi - algebraic constraints @xmath244 and @xmath275 and with the partial order of the tree , equivalently equations ( [ treefact ] ) .    for @xmath263",
    "let @xmath276 .",
    "we can re - arrange the list @xmath277 to list first primitive probabilities of edges not in @xmath189 and then a manipulation on @xmath189 is given by the mapping @xmath278 for the typical manipulations in @xcite and in section [ section3.3 ] this map simplifies to an orthogonal projection on @xmath279 .      to effectively discuss causal maps we notice that we need 1 . a finite set of `` circumstances '' in the bn represented by parent configurations and in the tree by the tree situations augmented with a finite set of `` terminal circumstances '' , e.g. the possible final outcomes of an experiment , and 2 .",
    "a partial order defined on these circumstances expressing the causal hypotheses of the system .",
    "the circumstances could be identified with particular types of causally critical events in the event space of the uncontrolled system , e.g. @xmath248 of section [ sectiontree ] .",
    "hence let @xmath280 be the finite set representing circumstances and terminal circumstances and @xmath15 a partial order on @xmath237 .",
    "the partial order can be visualised through its hasse diagram and corresponds to a finite number of chains of elements of @xmath237 .",
    "a chain is a list of elements in @xmath237 : @xmath281 where @xmath282 for all @xmath170 and such that for no @xmath283 we have @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "a circumstance can belong to more than one chain and chains can have different lengths , initial circumstances and terminal circumstances .",
    "a chain represents a possible unfolding of the problem we are modelling , from a starting point , @xmath251 , to an end point , @xmath286 .",
    "the order represents the way circumstances succeed one another and one could be the cause of a subsequent one .",
    "once the partial order in @xmath237 has been elicited , a parametrization of a saturated statistical model on @xmath237 can be defined as a set of transition probabilities : @xmath243 $ ] where @xmath287 are such that @xmath241 and @xmath240 are in the same chain , say @xmath288 , @xmath289 and there is no @xmath290 such that @xmath291 . that is , there is a chain to which both @xmath240 and @xmath241 belong and @xmath240 precedes @xmath241 immediately in the chain .",
    "we call @xmath247 primitive probabilities , collect them in a vector @xmath292 and note that they can be given as labels to the edges of the hasse diagram . moreover , we require that if @xmath240 belongs to more than one chain , then the sum of the transition probabilities @xmath293 is equal to one , i.e. @xmath294 .",
    "this defines the domain space of @xmath295 as a product of the simplices in total analogy to the cases of bn s and trees .",
    "the probability of a chain @xmath288 is now defined as @xmath296 , in analogy to equations ( [ treefact ] ) and ( [ multiplicationrule ] ) .",
    "thus , we have determined a saturated model parametrised with @xmath277 and given by the sum - to - one constraints and the non - negative conditions .",
    "a sub - model , say @xmath297 , can be defined by adjoining equalities and inequalities between polynomials or ratios of polynomials in the primitive probabilities , say @xmath298 and @xmath299 , where @xmath300 and @xmath151 are polynomials or ratios of polynomials . of course one must ensure that there is at least one solution to the obtained system of equalities and inequalities ;",
    "that is , that the model is feasible .",
    "sub - models can also be defined through a refinement of the partial order .",
    "next , causality can be defined implicitly by considering a set @xmath189 of edges of the hasse diagram and for @xmath266 adjoining to @xmath297 a new set of primitive probabilities @xmath268 and some equations @xmath301 where @xmath302 is a polynomial .",
    "collect the new parameters in the list @xmath303 , where @xmath304 .",
    "identifiability problems are now formulated as in previous sections .",
    "suppose we observe some polynomial equalities of the primitive probabilities , @xmath305 , and even some inequalities @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is a vector of polynomials .",
    "then we are interested in checking whether a total cause , @xmath308 , is identifiable from and compatible with the given observation",
    ". this computation could be done by using techniques of algebraic geometry in total analogy to bn s and trees as discussed in item  [ identpoint ] .",
    "the top - down scheme in table [ summary ] summarises all this . in the top cell",
    "we have a semi - algebraic set - up involving equalities and inequalities in the @xmath309 parameters involving polynomials or ratios of polynomials .",
    "we must ensure that the set of values of @xmath309 which solve this system of equalities and inequalities is not empty , i.e. the model is feasible . in the next two cells we add two sets of indeterminates : @xmath310 and @xmath311 , and some equalities and inequalities of polynomials in the @xmath277 .",
    "then the effect @xmath242 is uniquely identified if there is a value @xmath312 of @xmath277 satisfying the system and @xmath313 .",
    "[ summary ]    .summary of section [ extreme ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     all the models considered in this paper fall within this framework and within the class of algebraic statistical models @xcite . in particular in ceg models @xcite circumstances are defined as sets of vertices of a tree and the partial order is inherited from the tree order .",
    "ceg s in a causal context have been studied in @xcite and they have been applied to the study of biological regulation models @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that there are many other classes of causal models that have an algebraic formulation of this type and are useful in practical applications .",
    "we end this paper by a short discussion of how the identifiablity issues associated with the non - graphical example of section [ section2violent ] can be addressed algebraically .      for the example in section [ section2violent ] assume conditions ( [ nomovie ] ) and ( [ movietable ] ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath314 the non - zero probabilities associated with not viewing the movie are @xmath315 and @xmath316 whilst the probabilities associated with viewing it are given in table [ malaimpaginazione ] .",
    "[ malaimpaginazione ] @xmath317    consider the two controls described in the bullets in section [ sectioncausal ] .",
    "the first , banning the film , gives non - zero probabilities for @xmath314 satisfying the equations @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "the second , the fixing of testosterone levels to low for all time , gives manipulated probabilities @xmath320 now consider three experiments .",
    "experiment  1 of section [ sectionmanifest ] exposes men to the movie , measuring their testosterone levels before and after viewing the film .",
    "this obviously provides us with estimates of @xmath321 , for @xmath314 and @xmath322 @xmath323 . under experiment  2 of section [ sectionmanifest ] a large random large sample is taken over the relevant population providing good estimates of the probability of the margin of each pair of @xmath27 and the level of testosterone @xmath34 on those who fought , @xmath126 , but only the probability of not fighting otherwise .",
    "so you can estimate the values of and sample for @xmath314 @xmath324 and @xmath325note the last probability is redundant since it is one minus the sum of those given above .",
    "finally experiment 3 is a survey that informs us about the proportion of people watching the movie on any night , i.e tells us @xmath326 .",
    "now suppose we are interested in the total cause @xcite @xmath327 of fighting if forced not to watch .",
    "clearly this is identified from an experiment that includes experiments  2 and  3 by summing and division by @xmath328 , but by no other combination of experiments .",
    "similarly @xmath329 , the probability a man with testosterone levels held low watches the movie and fights , is identified from @xmath330 obtained from experiment  1 and  2 by division .",
    "the movie example falls within the general scheme of section [ section4 ] .",
    "of course a graphical representation of the movie example , e.g. over a tree or even a bn , is possible and useful .",
    "but one of the point of this paper is to show that when discussing causal modelling the first step does not need to be the elicitation of a graphical structure whose geometry can then be examined through its underlying algebra .",
    "rather an algebraic formulation based on the identification of the circumstances of interest , e.g. the set @xmath237 , and the elicitation of a causal order , e.g. the partial order on @xmath237 , is a more naturally starting point . clearly in such framework on one hand the graphical type of symmetries embedded and easily visualised on e.g. a bn are not immediately available but they can be retrieved ( for an example involving ceg and bn see @xcite ) . on the other hand algebraic type of symmetries might be easily spotted and be exploited in the relevant computations",
    ".    in this example computation was simple algebraic operation while in more complex case we might need to recur to a computer .",
    "of course the usual difficulties of using current computer code for elimination problems of this kind remain , because inequality constraints are not currently integrated into software and because of the high number of primitive probabilities involved .",
    "caveats in section [ section3 ] for bn s , like the advantages of ad - hoc parametrizations , apply to these structures based on trees and/or defined algebraically .",
