    "the study of the polarized emission at microwave frequencies is fundamental to understand the physical processes in our galaxy .",
    "moreover , the galactic emission represents a foreground noise in cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) anisotropy experiments .",
    "finally , the polarized component of the cbr contains more information about our universe than cbr anisotropies , in particular concerning the nature of the primordial fluctuations and the re - ionization era .",
    "the sky polarization observatory ( sport ) is a space experiment devoted to measure the sky polarized emission in the microwave domain ( 20 - 90  ghz ) with 7@xmath0 beamwidth .",
    "it is the first scientific payload specifically designed to make a _",
    "clean _ measurements of the q and u stokes parameters .",
    "sport radiometers , in fact , are optimized for this purpose by adopting :    - simple optics ( corrugated feed horns ) to avoid additional spurious polarization from off - axis reflections ;    - low cross - polarization antenna system ;    - q and u correlated outputs .",
    "main features of the sport experiment are summarized in table  [ main ] , for a detailed description of sport technical issues see @xcite .    during its 18 months lifetime",
    ", sport will provide the first high frequency , high sensitivity ( @xmath1k ) polarization maps of the sky , mapping the synchrotron emission at lower frequencies ( 20 - 30  ghz ) and attempting the detection of the polarized component of the cbr .    sport is totally sponsored by the italian space agency ( asi ) and it has been selected by the european space agency ( esa ) to fly on the international space station ( iss ) in 2003 .",
    "[ main ]    .sport characteristics [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as it can be seen from figure  [ sp_shape ] , sport frequencies have been chosen to satisfy the two main experiment s aims :    - sport lowest frequency channels ( 20 - 32  ghz ) lie in a foreground dominated spectral window ;    - the highest frequency channels ( 60 - 90  ghz ) could be exploited to detect cbr polarized emission in a spectral window were foreground emission has its minimum .",
    "the sport experiment is expected to measure the sky polarized emission in an unexplored frequency window with expected sensitivity @xmath2 times better than the best existing upper limit on cbr polarization .",
    "sport should reach these goals thanks to its wide frequency coverage that includes the `` cosmological window '' ( @xmath3  ghz ) of minimum expected foreground emission .",
    "such a sensitivity , together with the extended sky ( @xmath4% ) and frequency coverage should allow to put new and quite severe constraints on the cbr polarization at degrees angular scales .",
    "finally , it would be pointed out that the very simple sport layout configuration has been mainly imposed by the need to match the iss environment , but it represents anyway a new approach to very sensitive polarization measurements .",
    "0.5 cm * acknowledgements * authors acknowledge esa for the encouragement and partial financial support of the sport project , as well as asi for the full approval and funding of the sport program .",
    "a special thank is for all the sport collaboration .",
