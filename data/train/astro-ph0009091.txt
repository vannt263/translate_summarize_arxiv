    "we have observed coma a at the frequency of the redshifted hi  line ( 1343 mhz ) with the wsrt using 10 mhz bandwidth and a velocity resolution of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 . at the resolution of our observations ( about 13 arcsec ) , the radio structure of coma a appears just resolved in two structures corresponding to the northern and southern lobes .",
    "the preliminary results show that we have detected hi  in absorption against _ both radio lobes_. in both lobes the peak of the absorption is at a very low optical depth ( @xmath7 % ) .",
    "this low optical depth is likely to be due ( at least in part ) to dilution .",
    "the velocity of the absorption is about 200 km s@xmath3 redshifted for the northern lobe and between 100 and 150 km s@xmath3 blueshifted for the southern lobe compared to the systemic velocity .",
    "the fwhm is between 150 and 200 km s@xmath3 . assuming a spin temperature of 100 k , this gives a column density of @xmath8 atoms @xmath9 .",
    "velocities of the ionized gas derived from a slit aligned with the radio axis show the same trend with position .",
    "thus , _ the hi appears kinematically associated with the ionized gas_.    _ * fig.1 * panel showing the approximate location of the hi  absorption . in the plots , the dashed line represents the systemic velocity . in the middle , is the h@xmath4 image with superimposed the contours from a 20 cm vla image . _",
    "one of the very few objects in which spatially extended 21-cm hi  absorption has been detected against the radio lobes is the central radio galaxy in the cooling flow cluster abell 2597 ( odea et al .",
    "this has been interpreted as indication that the radio lobes are surrounded by a collection of clouds containing both neutral and ionized gas .",
    "the same could apply to coma a , with the main difference that _ the scale of the phenomena is larger _ ( several tens of kpc instead of few kpc ) .",
    "indeed , in the case of coma a , the complicated h@xmath10 structure has been explained by a particularly gas rich environment surrounding the galaxy and that the close morphological association is due to the radio lobes expanding into this gas - rich environment ( tadhunter et al .",
    "the detected hi  would just be part of this system .",
    "coma a could be the result of interactions / mergers between the dominant giant galaxy and less massive galaxies in the same group .",
    "although we can not yet say how spatially extended the observed absorption is , it is quite likely that coma a indeed possesses extended hi  structures ."
