    "[ eqgraphenehamiltonian ] with the typical hamiltonian in eq .",

    "thus , as previously discussed , electrons near the @xmath91 point do not interact with the field in the tight - binding model within the nearest neighbour interaction approximation .",

    "we find that the population inversion @xmath173 approaches to its maximal value around @xmath132 , induced by the one - photon absorption .",
    "thus , the one - photon absorption enhanced four - wave mixing is the most likely to saturate .",
    "if we inspect the purturbative solution @xmath174 , we find that population inversion induced by one - photon absorption is a second - order process . in comparison ,",
    "the population inversions induced by two - photon absorption , pump - signal detuning , or idler simulation are third - order processes with much weaker magnitudes .",
    "although the signal mode can also induce second - order population inversion , it can be neglected when the strong pump approximation is valid , since the signal intensity is much less than the pump intensity . under high excitation power levels that can completely change the state - occupation probabilities over the valence and the conduction band ,",
