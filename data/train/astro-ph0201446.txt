    "high energy astrophysics is experiencing a considerable development , notably through the operation of a new generation of gamma - ray observatories , both on the ground and onboard satellites .",
    "the analysis of gamma - ray emission from compact and diffuse sources is one of the most valuable ways to study high energy processes in the universe , and it is expected to put stronger and stronger constraints on the models in the near future . among the processes of interest ,",
    "the production of gamma - ray lines by energetic particles ( eps ) interacting in the interstellar medium ( ism ) has received increased attention in the last few years , in connection with the data of the compton gamma - ray observatory as well as the forthcoming satellite integral .",
    "in addition to the study of the high energy sources , the study of ep interactions is important for the understanding of the eps themselves , of which the galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) are one of the main components .",
    "information about the acceleration sites and processes is also provided by the determination of the ep energy spectrum and chemical composition , which can be derived , in principle , from the measurement of gamma - ray line ratios and profiles .",
    "however , the information contained in the gamma - ray observational data relates to the spectrum and composition of the _ propagated _ particles ( i.e. those who actually interact in the ism ) , not the _ source _ particles .",
    "the difference arises from the fact that the eps experience various types of interactions while they ` propagate ' from their source to the place where they produce gamma - ray lines .",
    "in particular , they lose energy through coulombian interactions in a way which depends on both their energy and chemical nature , so that the propagated population of eps is not identical to the source population , freshly coming out of the acceleration process .",
    "ideally , one would divide the whole process into three successive stages ( e.g. parizot and lehoucq , 1999 ) : particle acceleration , propagation and interaction , with the gamma - ray production arising during the last stage only . in reality , of course , the reactions leading to gamma - ray production occur all the time , from the injection of the eps into the ism until they have slowed down to energies below the interaction thresholds .",
    "it is therefore necessary to sum the contributions of all the instants following acceleration ( the gamma - ray emission occurring during acceleration itself can usually be neglected , except for the rarest , highest energy particles , which spent a long time in the accelerator ) . in steady state situations ,",
    "this is equivalent to calculating the equilibrium distribution of eps and integrating the relevant cross sections over this so - called propagated distribution .    from a technical point of view",
    ", the most difficult part consists in calculating the propagated spectrum , taking into account the energy losses and the energy - dependent escape time of the particles out of the confinement region , where the gamma - ray production is evaluated .",
    "this is what prevents a straightforward calculation of the expected gamma - ray line fluxes from the knowledge of the nuclear cross sections and the ep source distribution .",
    "therefore , we propose here to work out this step once and for all , in the case of a steady state and a thick target , by calculating the integrated effect of energy losses on individual particles injected at any energy in the ism . in sect .",
    "[ sec.universality ] , we shall justify the fact that the ` propagation step ' in a standard @xmath0-ray line emission calculation can be ` factorized out ' and calculated separately , independently of the ep source spectrum and composition .",
    "this is true if the metallicity of the propagation medium does not exceed several tens of times the solar metallicity , as in most of the astrophysically sensible situations . as a result ,",
    "we shall obtain the absolute @xmath0-ray yields of energetic nuclei as a function of their initial energy , from which the @xmath0-ray line emission induced by eps of any spectrum and composition can be straightforwardly calculated .",
    "in addition to making @xmath0-ray line calculations much easier , these absolute yields ( or particle efficiencies for @xmath0-ray line production ) considerably help phenomenological interpretation of the observational data , as these yields only need to be convolved with the ep _ source _ spectra , rather than _ propagated _ ones .",
    "in order to calculate the gamma - ray line emission in a given region of the ism , one needs to integrate the nuclear excitation cross sections over the local flux of energetic particles , and sum all the contributions to each gamma - ray line .",
    "if @xmath1 represents the projectile , @xmath2 the target nucleus , and @xmath3 the excited nucleus produced in the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or equivalently the ` photon species ' emitted through nuclear de - excitation , the @xmath0-ray line emission rate , in @xmath4 , from all the @xmath5 nuclear reactions , reads :    @xmath6\\d e \\\\ & =      \\sum_{i , j}\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\phi_{i}(e)n_{j }      \\sigma_{i , j;k}(e)\\d e ,      \\end{split }      \\label{eq : tauxprodstat}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the spectral density of the projectiles @xmath1 , in @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the corresponding flux , in @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the velocity of the projectiles ( independent of the nuclear species , @xmath1 , if the energy @xmath12 is expressed in mev / n ) , @xmath13 is the number density of the target nuclear species @xmath2 , and @xmath14 is the cross section for the reaction @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 might represent photons from the @xmath15 de - excitation line at 4.44  mev , produced by the reaction @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "assuming that the nuclear excitation cross - sections are known , the main challenge is to estimate the ep fluxes , for each nuclear species , in the gamma - ray source .",
    "this depends on the acceleration process at the origin of the injection of eps in the ism , and on what happens to the particles once they leave the accelerator , which involves the energy losses , the rate of escape from the region considered , and the particle destruction in inelastic nuclear processes .",
    "as far as the acceleration is concerned , it can be characterized here by the so - called _ injection function _ , @xmath18 , which gives the number of particles of species @xmath1 injected at energy @xmath12 in the ism ( i.e. leaving the acceleration process and not being further accelerated afterwards ) , in @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath18 will either be taken as the outcome of some particular acceleration model ( e.g. diffusive shock acceleration ) , or phenomenologically postulated so as to reproduce some particular observation ( e.g. from integral data ) .",
    "most studies so far have assumed that the shape of the injection spectrum , @xmath18 , was independent of the nuclear species , and could be re - written as @xmath20 , where the isotopic abundances @xmath21 characterize the chemical composition of the eps _ at the source_. however , this simplification is not required and one will allow here for a different spectrum for each nuclear species , which is equivalent to an energy dependent ep composition .    in order to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : tauxprodstat ] ) to calculate the gamma - ray emission produced in the region under consideration , one needs to derive the ep fluxes , @xmath22 or @xmath7 , from the injection functions , @xmath18 , supposed known .",
    "the standard way to do this has been described in parizot and lehoucq ( 1999 , and references therein ) for the general case where the injection function as well as the conditions of propagation are time - dependent .",
    "it consists in solving the so - called propagation equation , which takes the following form in the stationary case :    @xmath23    here , @xmath24 is the energy loss function , in @xmath25 , giving the rate of energy loss for nuclei of species @xmath1 in the considered propagation medium , and @xmath26 is the total ` loss time ' taking into account nuclear destruction and particle escape out of the region considered .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of the total inelastic cross sections for nuclei of species @xmath1 in a medium made of @xmath2 nuclei alone , @xmath27 , and the mean escape time , @xmath28 , as :    @xmath29    where @xmath13 is as above the number density of nuclei of species @xmath2 in the propagation medium .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : statpropequa ] ) , the injection function @xmath18 acts as a source term , while the equilibrium ep distribution @xmath7 is what we want to calculate . the formal solution of the stationary propagation equation reads :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 can be interpreted as the survival probability , in the propagation medium considered , of a particle injected at energy @xmath32 and losing energy down to energy @xmath12 .",
    "it obviously depends on the total loss time at each energy between @xmath32 and @xmath12 and the energy loss function , and can be expressed as follows ( see parizot and lehoucq , 1999 ) :    @xmath33",
    "equation  ( [ eq : tauxprodstat ] ) allows one to calculate the photon emission rate for any gamma - ray de - excitation line for which the production cross sections are known .",
    "it is based on the computation of the ep distribution function given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : statsolution ] ) , which in turn requires the knowledge of the energy losses and the escape and destruction times .",
    "let us first consider the energy loss rate , @xmath34 , for particles of species @xmath1 .",
    "it can be expressed as a sum over the nuclear species present in the propagation medium :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the energy loss per unit grammage in a medium of pure @xmath2 nuclei , in @xmath37 . in this expression",
    ", @xmath36 is a ` universal function ' of energy which can ideally be calculated from first physical principles or , failing that , extrapolated from laboratory measurements , while the astrophysics comes in the chemical composition , the degree of ionization and the density of the propagation medium , @xmath13 .",
    "some examples of energy loss functions used in this paper are shown in fig .",
    "[ energylosses ] .",
    "they have been calculated using the program of j. kiener ( 1994 ) , based on the modified bethe formula taking into account the effective charge of the projectile . this program implements the ziegler tables for the various stopping powers , as corrected by hubert et al .",
    "( 1989 ) according to a semi - empirical procedure , where a new parameterization for the effective charge is deduced from a very large set of experimental stopping power values in the range 380  mev / n .",
    "the typical error in the energy loss function is between 2% and 10% , i.e. less than the uncertainty about the nuclear excitation cross - sections .",
    "the energy range of interest for the calculation of gamma - ray line emission is between a few mev / n ( corresponding to the nuclear excitation thresholds ) and a few hundreds of mev / n . at higher energy , the contribution of the eps to the gamma - ray line emission is small , because of their reduced number ( decreasing power - law source spectrum ) as well as because they are destroyed by nuclear reactions before they reach the peaks of the nuclear excitation cross sections , as further discussed below .    in all the calculations presented here ,",
    "the ambient medium is assumed neutral , which may not be appropriate for a number of astrophysical situations .",
    "however , one can estimate that the effect of an ambient ionized medium is small , except for the lowest energies .",
    "the reason why the energy losses depend on the ionization state of the propagation medium is that it is more difficult for an energetic ion to capture a free electron than to capture an electron from an atom at rest .",
    "indeed , in the latter case , the orbital motion of the electron reduces the velocity difference between the energetic ion and the electron , and thereby facilitates capture . as a consequence ,",
    "the equilibrium between electron stripping and electron capture depends on the ambient medium , and an energetic atom is on average more ionized when it travels through a plasma than through a neutral medium ( chabot et al . , 1995a ) .",
    "this results in a higher effective charge , and thus a higher stopping power ( or larger energy losses ) .",
    "however , when the projectile is too energetic , its relative velocity with even orbital electrons is too high for charge exchange to be efficient anyway .",
    "therefore , the difference between an ionized and a neutral ambient medium becomes negligible , and the energy losses are almost identical .",
    "from the quantitative point of view , the stopping power of a plasma is higher than that of a neutral medium by a factor of about 40 below 100  kev / n , but only 2 or 3 at a few mev / n , and their difference is negligible above 100  mev / n ( hoffman et al . , 1994 ; chabot et al . , 1995b ) .",
    "therefore , we will assume throughout that the propagation medium is neutral .",
    "as far as the chemical composition is concerned , in most astrophysically relevant cases the propagation medium will be but the ism , whose composition is relatively well known ( anders and grevesse , 1989 ) .",
    "now , although the heavy elements are of course crucial to the calculation of gamma - ray de - excitation line emission , the ism is so much dominated by h and he nuclei that one can neglect all other elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energyloss ] ) , and calculate the energy loss rate as if the ism were made simply of 91% of h and 9% of he ( by number ) . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have calculated the propagated ( equilibrium ) spectrum of the different energetic nuclei subject to energy losses in media of various metallicity .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ propagatedspectra ] for metallicities ranging from 0 ( h and he only ) to 1000 times solar .",
    "a significant change in the particle propagated spectrum can only be noticed for ambient metallicities",
    "larger than ten times the solar metallicity , @xmath38 .",
    "since most of the astrophysically relevant media are not that rich in metals , we will assume that the propagation of the eps is independent of metallicity .",
    "note that even pure sn ejecta have a metallicity less than 30 times @xmath38 , so that even in such a metal - rich medium , neglecting the interaction of the eps with the metals as they propagate through the ambient medium will lead to an error smaller than 20% on the propagated particle distribution , @xmath7 , and thus also on the gamma - ray line production rates .",
    "the second crucial physical ingredient necessary to calculate the ep propagated spectra is the total ` catastrophic loss time ' , @xmath26 , including both nuclear destruction and escape ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : totallosstime ] ) ) .",
    "the latter will be neglected here , which amounts to say that we consider a distribution of eps interacting with a thick target .",
    "this is well justified for the relatively low energy particles which are responsible for most of the gamma - ray line emission , as their range is of the order of @xmath39 , i.e. significantly less than the typical escape grammage of cosmic rays .",
    "one can thus replace the total catastrophic loss timescale , @xmath26 , by the destruction timescale , @xmath40 .",
    "concerning the ep destruction through nuclear reactions , we use semi - empirical total inelastic cross sections from silberberg et tsao ( 1990 ) . as for the energy loss function ,",
    "we have just seen that the ep destruction time can be calculated as if the propagation medium were made of pure h and he , to an excellent approximation ( even for relatively high ambient metallicities ) . in all of our calculations ,",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the relatively poor knowledge of the nuclear cross sections , rather than from the use of a ` universal ' ( metal - free ) propagation medium .",
    ".,width=302 ]    the joint knowledge of @xmath34 and @xmath26 allows one to calculate the survival probability of an ep injected at any energy @xmath32 while it loses energy down to the energy @xmath12 at which it interacts with the ism to produce a gamma - ray",
    ". it can be useful to define the energy loss timescale , @xmath41 for an ep of type @xmath1 as : @xmath42    the survival probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : survivalproba ] ) can then be rewritten as : @xmath43    fig .",
    "[ fig : survivalproba ] shows the results obtained in the case of a @xmath44c nucleus .",
    "as can be seen , particles injected at energies greater than 1  gev / n have very little chance to survive long enough to reach energies of a few tens of mev / n , where the nuclear excitation cross sections are maximum . as a consequence , their contribution to the total gamma - ray emission rate will be negligible , not mentioning the fact that higher energy particles are usually less numerous than lower energy ones , for the most common , power - law source spectra .",
    "this effect reminds us that nuclear excitation is only one of a number of competing nuclear processes affecting an energetic particle , so that the efficiency of gamma - ray line production depends on the balance between several cross sections .",
    "we now make use of the results of the previous section to derive an alternate way to calculate gamma - ray line production from eps .",
    "this idea is the following : since particle propagation is ` universal ' ( i.e. independent of the physical conditions of the propagation medium , as long as metals can be neglected ) , there should be a way to work it out once and for all .",
    "this way is the following : instead of calculating the equilibrium ep distribution function ( after propagation ) , and then integrate the nuclear cross section over this distribution , one can calculate the total photon yield , from injection to rest , of one ep of a given kind thrown in the ism at any given initial energy , independently of the other particles ( i.e. independently of the global spectrum and composition of the eps ) , and then integrate the individual photon yields over the source distribution function of each kind of eps accelerated .",
    "the important point is that the integration is now over the _ source _ distribution function , which is known from acceleration models or postulated in a phenomenological study , rather than over the _ propagated _ distribution function , which no longer has to be calculated .    from the mathematical point of view , the above idea amounts to a simple change of the order of two integrations .",
    "indeed , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tauxprodstat ] ) and  ( [ eq : statsolution ] ) , one can rewrite the @xmath0-ray emission rate as follows ( specializing to one nuclear reaction for illustration ) :",
    "@xmath45    where @xmath46 is the density of the propagation medium and @xmath47 is the ep _ source _ spectrum .",
    "now , as is made obvious by fig .",
    "[ fig : mathtransform ] , this expression can be re - written as :    @xmath48    ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : prodrate2 ] ) : the shaded area is the integration domain , divided into vertical and horizontal slices , respectively.,width=313 ]    getting the source function , @xmath49 , out of the integral over @xmath12 , one obtains the following expression for the @xmath0-ray emission rate ( adding the contribution of all the reactions involved ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the relative abundance of nuclei of species @xmath2 in the target , and @xmath52              +        +      the physical interpretation of @xmath53 is straightforward : it is the number of photons of species @xmath0 produced in a target made solely of nuclei of species @xmath2 , by one projectile of species @xmath1 injected in the ism at the energy @xmath32 , integrated over its entire life ( i.e. from its injection until it has lost so much energy that it is below the nuclear excitation threshold ) .",
    "note that the lower bound of the integral can be replace by the energy threshold of the cross sections .",
    "now the interesting point is that the absolute photon yields , @xmath53 , can be calculated from physical quantities alone and is independent of astrophysics : as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : photonyield ] ) and  ( [ eq : survivalproba ] ) , it only depends on the nuclear cross sections and energy loss rates .",
    "these can be calculated or measured once and for all , and so is it for @xmath53 .    as anticipated , the great advantage of this formulation is that once the quantities @xmath53 have been calculated , the actual @xmath0-ray emission rate in a given astrophysical situation can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : prodrateinverted ] ) which gathers all the astrophysical information ( namely the ep spectrum and composition , and the target composition ) , but which is now expressed in terms of the _ source spectrum _ , rather than",
    "the _ propagated _ one .",
    "to better understand the signification of this transformation , it suffices to compare eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tauxprodstat ] ) and  ( [ eq : prodrateinverted ] ) .",
    "we have replaced the propagated spectral density of the eps , @xmath7 , by their injection function , @xmath18 , and the cross sections @xmath54 by our absolute photon yields , @xmath55 , which play the role of ` effective cross - sections ' ( although their physical dimension is different ) taking into account the propagation of the eps in the ambient medium . it should be stressed that the individual photon yields behave as universal physical quantities and can be used with any source spectrum , any ep composition _ and _ any target composition .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "first , the above expression giving the photon yields @xmath53 may seem to depend on the density , @xmath46 , of the propagation medium ( e.g. the ism ) .",
    "this is actually not the case , as the energy loss rate appearing in the denominator is also proportional to this density .",
    "the second comment concerns the universality of ep propagation , which is crucial in the approach developed here .",
    "indeed , in principle the ep energy loss rates and survival probabilities depend on the propagation medium , so that a different photon yield should be calculated for each propagation medium .",
    "these specific photon yields could still be used with any source spectrum and composition , but not with any target composition , as the latter is usually the same as that of the propagation medium . however , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sec.universality ] , the dependence of the energy loss rates and survival probabilities with metallicity is negligible in most situations , so that the photon yields @xmath55 can indeed be considered universal .",
    "before showing the individual photon yields calculated for the main expected gamma - ray lines in the ism , we should say a word about cross sections , as they provide the major uncertainty in our results and most of them are extrapolated from relatively scarce experimental data .",
    "we have used the data from ramaty et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , updated with more recent experimental data whenever possible ( dyer et al . , 1981,1985 ; lang et al . , 1987 ; lesko et al . 1988 ; kiener et al . , 2001 ) . the paper by kiener et al .",

    "the reaction is given in the first column , with the names of the target and projectile and the energy of the resulting gamma ray in mev .",
    "the second and third columns give the energy of the cross section peak and the corresponding value of the cross section . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a first approximation , we assume that the excitation cross sections of other nuclei ( namely , @xmath62n , @xmath63o , @xmath64ne and @xmath65fe ) obey the similar laws with the same value of the exponent @xmath66 , i.e. 1.74 and 1.51 respectively for proton - induced and alpha - particle - induced excitations . the constant value at high energy , @xmath67 , is simply taken as the value of @xmath67 for the @xmath44c excitation cross sections , but scaled to the measured value of the cross section at the resonance peak ( i.e. proportionally to the peak value ) .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath68 is obtained by imposing the continuity of the cross sections above the peak .",
    "the same procedure is applied to excitative spallation reactions ( i.e. an exponent of 1.98 and a high energy value scaled proportionally to the peak value ) , although such an extrapolation is more problematic in this case , as the @xmath63o nucleus has an atypical structure with a large component of four @xmath69 particles .",
    "the above procedure can be summarized by the following expression giving the cross section above the peak ( at energy @xmath70 and with cross section @xmath71 ) , in terms of the values of the reference cross section at the peak , @xmath72 , and at high energy , @xmath73 , given above :    @xmath74      \\label{eq : sigmaabovepeak}\\ ] ]    for completeness , we give the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the various cross sections considered in this paper in table  [ tab : crosssectionsdata ] .    in general , the error on the excitation cross sections and thus on the gamma - ray yields is typically 10% whenever actual experimental data exist ( this is the case for the two main lines of @xmath44c and @xmath63o ) , and of the order of 20% to 50% when the values are simply estimated or extrapolated .",
    "this is quite substantial , especially when our goal is to look at line ratios , in the hope to determine the composition of the eps and/or the ambient medium from gamma - ray line measurements .",
    "these errors , unfortunately , can not be lowered but by increasing the experimental effort at terrestrial accelerators .",
    "this is strongly recommended in order to make the most of the opening field of gamma - ray astronomy .      in fig .",

    "the evolution of @xmath55 as the injection energy increases can be interpreted in the following way .",
    "photon production begins when @xmath32 becomes greater than the reaction threshold .",
    "then it increases sharply as @xmath32 passes through the peak of the cross section , and increases more smoothly afterwards .",
    "as long as particle destruction or escape can be neglected , eq .",
    "( [ eq : photonyield ] ) makes it clear that the number of photons produced is an increasing function of @xmath32 , the upper bound of the integral .",
    "physically , the particle produces @xmath0-rays all the way as its energy goes down from @xmath32 to below the reaction threshold .",
    "if it is injected at a higher energy , it will produce @xmath0-rays for a longer time , integrating the cross section over a larger range of energy .",
    "but when @xmath32 increases further , there comes a time when the projectile has a large probability of being destroyed ( through a nuclear reaction ) or escaping from the region under study ( in a thin target model ) , _ before _ its energy drops below the reaction threshold . in this case",
    ", the effective energy range over which the cross section is integrated is reduced from below , and the overall @xmath0-ray yield starts to decrease .",
    "for large enough @xmath32 , the particle never reaches the most efficient energy range corresponding to the peak of the cross section . since both the destruction and the excitation cross sections are roughly constant at high energy , the photon yield tends to an ` asymptotic value ' where increasing the injection energy only shifts upwards the energy range of activity of the ep but does not change the integrated photon yield .",
    "this asymptotic value merely depends on the ratio of the excitation and destruction cross sections .",
    "typically , for the main @xmath0-ray lines to be expected in the ism , one can see from figs .",
    "[ fig : oline ] to  [ fig : neandfeline ] that several percent to up to 30% of the projectiles injected will produce a gamma - ray , with a peak of this number in the range @xmath75300  mev / n .    while the decrease of @xmath55 at high energy is not very steep , it should be realized that the @xmath0-ray production efficiency , defined as the number of photons produced per erg of projectiles injected , is falling down more quickly , as shown on the right sides of figs .",
    "[ fig : oline ] to  [ fig : neandfeline ] , for the same reactions as on the left sides .",

    "note that contrary to what might have been naively expected , this range starts at an energy higher than the cross section peak , and extends to even higher energies .",
    "in other words , the most efficient way to produce gamma - rays in the ism is to use eps with energies between , say , 10 to 300  mev / n .          from a practical point of view , the quantities @xmath53 also allow one to straightforwardly calculate the @xmath0-ray line emission in a given astrophysical situation .",

    "in addition to simplifying the calculation of gamma - ray line emission , the individual ep gamma - ray yields also provide a direct , intuitive tool to analyze gamma - ray line data from a phenomenological point of view , and construct an ep source spectrum and composition which could reproduce the intensity of the gamma - ray emission and the various line ratios .",
    "the results presented here correspond to a thick target model , which is relevant to most astrophysical situations for eps of energy lower than a few hundreds of mev / n .",
    "however , the same formalism can be used to calculate the total ep photon yields in a target with any escape length , be it energy - dependent or not .",
