    "the initiation of the radiation - dominated era of the universe is believed to result from the decay of coherent oscillations of a scalar field whose energy dominated the universe before decay .",

    "robertson  walker scale factor .",
    "one could just as easily imagine that the universe is dominated by some unstable massive particle species , rather than coherent oscillations of a scalar field . ]",
    "the reheat process is often associated with the final stage of inflation . however , reheating could have been episodic , with several reheat events after inflation .",
    "we will be interested in the final reheating before primordial nucleosynthesis , which may just as well have been the result of the decay of a weakly coupled scalar field unrelated to inflation , for instance a modulus .",
    "for this reason the scalar field @xmath6 , whose decay leads to reheating , will not be referred to as the inflaton .",
    "a common assumption is that many of the interesting cosmological phenomena accessible to present - day observations occurred after reheating , during the radiation - dominated phase of the early universe .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable assumption , since inflation @xcite erases any initial condition on the number densities of ordinary particles , while the reheat process repopulates the universe .",
    "the assumption of an initial condition of thermal and chemical equilibrium in a radiation - dominated universe is then equivalent to the hypothesis that the maximum temperature obtained during the radiation - dominated era , @xmath7 , is larger than characteristic temperatures of cosmological processes under investigation .",
    "the fact that we have no physical evidence of the radiation - dominated era before the epoch of nucleosynthesis ( _ i.e. , _ temperatures above about 1 mev ) is a simple , but crucial , point .",
    "therefore , _ a priori _ one should consider @xmath7 as an unknown quantity that can take any value as low as about 1 mev . indeed",
    ", there are good physical motivations for studying cosmologies with very low @xmath7 .    in theories",
    "in which the weakness of gravity is explained by large compactified extra dimensions @xcite , emission of kaluza - klein gravitons in the bulk constrains the normalcy temperature at which the radius of the compactified dimensions is stabilized with vanishing energy density in the compactified space to be in the mev to gev region @xcite . in practice",
    ", the stabilization occurs in a post - inflationary phase , and therefore we can identify the normalcy temperature with @xmath7 .",
    "supergravity and superstring theories usually have particles , such as a gravitino or a modulus , with only gravitational interactions",
    ". late decay of these particles may jeopardize the success of standard big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this problem can be solved by assuming sufficiently low @xmath7 , of the order of @xmath8 to @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently realized @xcite that nonthermal production of these gravitational relics during the inflationary phase can impose upper bounds on @xmath7 as low as 100 gev .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that the phenomenological point of view that the reheat temperature may be as low as 1 mev has rich implications for particle dark matter , neutrino mass limits , axion cosmology , and baryogenesis .",
    "the key point of our considerations is that reheating is not an instantaneous process . on the contrary",
    ", the radiation - dominated phase follows a prolonged stage of matter domination during which the energy density of the universe is dominated by the coherent oscillations of the field @xmath6 .",
    "the oscillations start at time @xmath10 and end when the age of the universe becomes of order of the lifetime @xmath11 of the scalar field . at times @xmath12 the dynamics of the system is quite involved . during this stage",
    "the energy density per comoving volume of the @xmath6 field decreases as @xmath13 and the light decay products of the scalar field thermalize .",
    "the temperature @xmath14 of this hot plasma , however , does not scale as @xmath15 as in the ordinary radiation - dominated phase ( @xmath5 is the friedmann ",
    " walker scale factor ) @xcite , but reaches a maximum @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the planck mass ) and then decreases as @xmath18 , signalling the continuous release of entropy from the decays of the scalar field .",
    "this scaling continues until the time @xmath19 when the radiation - dominated phase commences with temperature @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , before reheating is completed , for a given temperature the universe expands faster than in the radiation - dominated phase .",
    "notice that @xmath7 is not the maximum temperature during the reheat process . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath20 can be much larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the behavior of the universe during reheating is discussed in detail in sec .  [ reheating ] .    in sec .",
    "[ relic ] we will use these results to compute the relic abundance of a dark - matter species ( @xmath21 ) produced during reheating .",
    "we will consider the case that @xmath7 is smaller than the @xmath21 freeze - out temperature .",
    "although naively one might expect a negligible @xmath21 number density under these circumstances , we find that the @xmath21 relic density can reach cosmologically interesting values .",
    "we also show that because of entropy release during the reheat stage , for a given mass and cross section the present @xmath21 abundance is smaller than obtained assuming freeze out in the radiation - dominated era .",
    "this relaxes the bounds coming from requiring that @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , the parametric dependence on the mass and the annihilation cross section of the present abundance is nonstandard .",
    "therefore , most of the cosmological constraints on specific particle properties have to be revisited .",
    "the value of the maximum temperature during reheating , @xmath20 , delineates different regions for our results",
    ". if @xmath20 is smaller than the @xmath21 mass , @xmath21 particles generated by collisions in the thermal bath during the coherent @xmath6 oscillations are always nonrelativistic .",
    "if the cross section is small enough , the @xmath21 particles do not reach chemical equilibrium and the present abundance is _ proportional _ to the cross section , @xmath23 , in contrast with the usual radiation - dominated case in which @xmath24 .",
    "avoiding overclosure of the universe imposes a _ lower _ bound on the annihilation cross section . on the other hand , if the @xmath21 particles reach chemical equilibrium before reheating is completed , the ratio of the @xmath21 number density to entropy density in a comoving volume does not stop decreasing when the particles freeze out because entropy is released until reheating is over .",
    "therefore , the present abundance does not depend only on @xmath25 ( as in the standard case ) , but also on the reheat temperature @xmath7 : the lower @xmath7 , the smaller the abundance .",
    "we will provide a formula for @xmath26 which reproduces both the standard result when @xmath7 is equal to the freeze - out temperature of the relic particle and the nonstandard result @xmath27 when the value cross section becomes smaller than some critical value .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath7 are larger than the @xmath21 mass , we will show that the relevant processes determining the present @xmath21 abundance occur during reheating or afterwards .",
    "an important result is that @xmath20 ( or equivalently @xmath28 ) is relevant when deciding if @xmath21 is relativistic or not , but does not appear in the final expression for the relic abundance .",
    "therefore , once @xmath20 has determined the pertinent case , @xmath26 depends on the physics of the @xmath6 field only through @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to understand why .",
    "the @xmath21 number density results from the competition of two rates , the interaction rate and the expansion rate of the universe . before reheating",
    "is completed the expansion rate depends only on @xmath7 , @xmath29 , and therefore the final abundance depends only upon @xmath7 .    in sec .",
    "[ applications ] we discuss the applications of our findings to some popular cold dark matter candidates . here , we preview some of our results .    while excluded in the usual scenario , thermal wimps with mass larger than the unitarity bound of a few hundred tev @xcite may be viable dark matter candidates in low reheat models .    of the many wimp candidates ,",
    "the best motivated seems to be the neutralino , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) @xcite . in the case",
    "in which the lsp is mainly a bino , requiring @xmath30 gives an upper bound on the slepton mass @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , once we relax the assumption that the reheat temperature is higher than the freeze - out temperature of the wimp , we will show that the upper bound on @xmath31 is drastically relaxed and may completely disappear .",
    "the same argument can be applied to other supersymmetric candidates .",
    "another striking application for dark matter that illustrates our point is the computation of the relic abundance of massive neutrinos .",
    "the well - known cosmological cowsik ",
    "mcclelland  lee ",
    "weinberg bound @xcite rules out neutrinos more massive than roughly 90 ev and lighter than around 2 gev .",
    "this result has a significant impact in cosmology , ruling out , for instance , the possibility that neutrinos are warm dark matter .",
    "this standard result , however , assumes that the reheat temperature is much higher than 1 mev and that neutrinos have been in chemical equilibrium up to temperatures of the order of 1 mev .",
    "we will show that if the reheat temperature is as small as allowed by big - bang nucleosynthesis , then massive , stable dirac ( majorana ) neutrinos are compatible with cosmology if they are lighter than about 33 kev or heavier than about 6 ( 5 ) mev .",
    "this implies , for instance , that neutrinos may still be warm or cold dark matter and play a significant role in other cosmological or astrophysical phenomena .",
    "we then proceed by investigating the implications of a low reheat temperature for axion cosmology .",
    "it is well known that in the standard scenario the oscillations of the axion field generated by the misalignment mechanism overclose the universe unless the peccei - quinn scale , @xmath32 , is smaller than about @xmath4 gev .",
    "this bound , however , is obtained assuming that the reheat temperature is larger than the qcd scale .",
    "when this assumption is abandoned , the cosmological upper bound on @xmath32 is significantly relaxed to @xmath33 gev if @xmath34 mev .",
    "if the @xmath21 particle has a nonvanishing but small decay lifetime @xmath35 , its decay products may destroy the light elements generated during primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "this gives strong constraints in the plane @xmath36 @xcite that are very sensitive to the number density of the species @xmath21 at freeze out .",
    "lowering the reheat temperature implies a smaller number density and therefore much less restrictive bounds .",
    "these results all imply that presently stated cosmological limits may not always be relevant in limiting particle properties such as the supersymmetric mass spectra in the experimentally verifiable range of future colliders .    as a last application , in sec .",
    "[ baryolepto ] we analyze the production of unstable superheavy states during the process of reheating , keeping in mind the possibility that the subsequent decay of these states may generate the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "the fact that @xmath20 is larger than the reheat temperature may give rise to an efficient production of these superheavy states . as a result , out - of - equilibrium gut baryogenesis and/or leptogenesis can take place even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the mass of the superheavy decaying particle .",
    "this is particularly useful in supersymmetric scenarios where @xmath7 has to be low enough to avoid the overproduction of gravitinos and other dangerous relics .",

    "neutrinos are initially kept in equilibrium by weak interactions . for neutrinos lighter than about 1 mev , freeze out occurs at @xmath241 mev for electron neutrinos and @xmath242 mev for muon and tau neutrinos , so the neutrinos are relativistic at freeze out .",

    "one usually concludes that the mass of sm neutrinos can not be larger than @xmath246 ev , the cowsik  mcclelland bound @xcite .",
    "if neutrino masses are larger than the freeze - out temperature , they decouple from the thermal bath when they are nonrelativistic . in this case",
    "the annihilation cross section is proportional to @xmath247 , and requiring @xmath248 provides an lower bound on @xmath0 of about 2 gev , the lee ",
    "weinberg bound @xcite .",
    "this means that neutrino masses in the range 94 ev @xmath249 2 gev are cosmologically ruled out .",
    "this is the celebrated cowsik - mcclelland  lee - weinberg ( cmlw ) bound @xcite .",
    "this picture has to be modified in the case in which the reheat temperature is small .",
    "the standard cmlw bound is based on the assumption that neutrinos have reached thermal and chemical equilibrium in the radiation - dominated universe .",
    "this is equivalent to the hypothesis that the maximum temperature obtained during the ( last ) radiation - dominated era , that is , the reheat temperature @xmath7 , is much larger than the decoupling temperature @xmath250 .",
    "we have no physical evidence of the radiation - dominated era before the epoch of nucleosynthesis ( _ i.e. , _ temperatures above about 1 mev ) .",
    "therefore , let us explore the possibility that the largest temperature of the universe during the radiation - dominated phase is very small .",
    "indeed , it has been recently shown that the smallest value not excluded by nucleosynthesis at more than 95% cl is @xmath251 mev @xcite .",
    "since neutrinos have only weak interactions , it is very difficult for the thermal scatterings of particles during the reheat stage to generate sm neutrinos through processes like @xmath252 and to bring neutrinos into chemical equilibrium . furthermore , decreasing the reheat temperature increases the rate of the expansion of the universe , as explicitly seen in eq.([hhhh ] ) , making it more difficult for the weak interactions to bring the neutrinos into chemical equilibrium . therefore , if the reheat temperature is small enough , one should expect that the sm neutrinos produced during the reheat stage _ never _ reach chemical equilibrium .",
    "in other words , at the beginning of the radiation - dominated phase neutrinos populate the thermal bath , but they have a number density , @xmath253 , which is _ smaller _ than the equilibrium number density , @xmath254 .",

    "i.e. , _ @xmath256 .",
    "this implies that neutrino annihilations are not efficient .",
    "this result applies both to relativistic and nonrelativistic sm neutrinos , and implies that the present abundance of neutrinos in low @xmath7 models is much smaller than predicted assuming that the largest temperature of the radiation - dominated universe was much larger than a few mev .",
