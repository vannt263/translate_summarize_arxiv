    "recent measurements of distant supernovae ( snia ) @xcite indicate that our universe is in an accelerating phase of expansion .",
    "this has stimulated the search for models explaining this phenomenon .",
    "there are two alternative types of explanation observed acceleration : 1 ) the universe is accelerating due to presence of so called dark energy violating the strong energy condition @xcite , 2 ) instead of dark energy of unknown form the modification ( or generalization ) of the frw equation is postulated .",
    "while the cosmological constant is still attractive proposition for dark energy , it offers only some effective model without understanding of observed value of vacuum energy .",
    "this situation open the cosmology on different propositions of candidates for dark energy description @xcite .",
    "all these models can be described in terms of a two - dimensional dynamical system of the newtonian type if it is assumed a general form of the equation of state @xmath1 for dark energy @xmath2 @xcite . from the conservation condition ( under condition spatial homogeneity and isotropy ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are effective energy density and pressure respectively , @xmath6 is the hubble function , @xmath7 is the scale factor , a dot denotes the differentiation with respect to the cosmological time .",
    "we obtain that @xmath8 or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( @xmath11- the present value of the scale factor is chosen as a unity ) .    from the raychaundhuri equation ( called also the acceleration equation )",
    "we obtain additional equation governed evolution of the universe @xmath12 one can simply check that equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) assumes the form analogous to the form of the newtonian equation of motion @xmath13 if we choose the potential in the form @xmath14 where @xmath4 plays the role of effective energy density which satisfies the conservation condition .    equation ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    "admits first integral @xmath15 which is called the friedmann first integral .",
    "finally , due to the particle - like description of the evolution of the universe , which mimics motion of the fictitious particle moving in the potential well .",
    "the potential function is representing single function of scale factor which determine full evolutional scenarios of the cosmological model .",
    "therefore our proposition is using scale factor @xmath7 and its derivative as independent variables which measure states of the system .",
    "moreover in such approach we have additionally hamiltonian structure and the frw cosmological system is representing in terms of two - dimensional dynamical system .",
    "in such formulation space of states is defined in the following way : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the curvature index , @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 should be treated as a phase space of the system in which trajectories lies on algebraic curves which are determined by the hamiltonian constrained @xmath20 .",
    "if we reparameterize time variable @xmath21 then @xmath19 can be defined equivalently as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the density parameter for curvature fluid , @xmath24 is a dimensionless scale factor expressed in its present value @xmath11 .",
    "if we assume that fluid which filled the universe is composed with noninteracting fluids : dust matter , radiation and the cosmological constant then we obtain : @xmath25 where @xmath26 of course all density parameters @xmath27 are not independent and satisfy the constraint condition @xmath28 .",
    "the original friedmann first integral ( [ eq:4 ] ) can be rewritten to the form @xmath29 in order to survey the set of all its solutions ( which have an arbitrary parameter ) we pick a pair @xmath30 and represent the range of each possible solution @xmath31 corresponding to these data and an initial value @xmath32 , as a horizontal segment in a plane @xmath33 . for this purpose",
    "it is necessary to mark the boundary of the permitted region @xmath34 .",
    "the boundary is corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath32 - axis ) .",
    "from @xmath37 we obtain : @xmath38 from this boundary curve it is possible to obtain qualitatively a classification of all evolutional scenario in the configuration space .",
    "each model corresponding to a maximally extended line segment @xmath39 which includes the present value @xmath40",
    ". if that segment ( @xmath41 level ) is bounded on the left by the locus @xmath36 , the model has a big bang .",
    "the potential function is given by @xmath42 and all trajectories lies in the classically allowed region @xmath43 .",
    "let us consider now a more general model filled by dark energy satisfying the equation of state @xmath44 instead of the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "then we obtain the potential function in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46.\\ ] ] the full classification of dark energy models can be performed in the analogous way like to lambda models from consideration of a boundary curve @xmath47 .",
    "table 1 shows some examples of different dark energy models appeared in cosmological investigations sources of acceleration . in table 1",
    "we present also potentials function for alternative propositions of explanation acceleration without conception of dark energy . for these class of models",
    "it is proposed some modification of the friedmann first integral ( so called the cardassian models ) or new brane physics is incorporated ( dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgb ) models or the randall - sundrum brane cosmological models ) .",
    "let us introduce the definition of basic notion .",
    "by the ensemble of the frw cosmological models with dark energy it is understood a subspace of all dynamical systems on the plane which are represented the frw dynamical systems of a newtonian type , characterized by the potential function @xmath48 .",
    "this space can be naturally equipment in structure of the banach space if we introduce the @xmath49 metric @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a closed subspace of the configuration space , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are potential functions labeled as @xmath54 .    .different models explaining acceleration of the universe in terms of dark energy ( a ) and modification of the frw equation ( b ) .",

    "the akaike information criterion indicates that there is only one strong disfavored model ( case @xmath57 ) , whereas the bayesian information criterion denotes that also cases @xmath58 and @xmath59 are less probable than the @xmath0cdm model ( see figure 1 ) .",
