    "in this article , we consider two properties of graphs motivated by geometric group theory . we show that these properties are typically present in random graphs .",
    "we repay the debt to geometric group theory by applying our ( purely graph - theoretic ) results to the large - scale geometry of coxeter groups .",
    "let @xmath3 be the random graph model on @xmath8 vertices obtained by including each edge independently at random with probability @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is often referred to as the _ density _ of @xmath3 .",
    "the model @xmath3 was introduced by gilbert  @xcite , and the resulting random graphs are usually referred to as the `` erds  rnyi random graphs '' in honor of erds and rnyi s seminal contributions to the field , and we follow this convention .",
    "we say that a property @xmath10 holds _ asymptotically almost surely _",
    "( a.a.s . ) in @xmath3 if for @xmath5 we have @xmath11 as @xmath12",
    ". in this paper we will be interested in proving that certain global properties hold a.a.s.in @xmath3 both for a wide range of probabilities @xmath9 .",
    "a graph property is _",
    "( monotone ) increasing _ if it is closed under the addition of edges .",
    "a paradigm in the theory of random graphs is that global increasing graph properties exhibit _ sharp thresholds _ in @xmath3 : for many global increasing properties @xmath10 , there is a _ critical density _",
    "@xmath13 such that for any fixed @xmath14 if @xmath15 then a.a.s .  @xmath10 does not hold in @xmath3 , while if @xmath16 then a.a.s .  @xmath10 holds in @xmath3 .",
    "a quintessential example is the following classical result of erds and rnyi which provides a sharp threshold for connectedness :    [ er : connected ] there is a sharp threshold for connectivity of a random graph with critical density @xmath17 .    the local structure of the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph is well understood , largely due to the assumption of independence between the edges .",
    "for example , erds  rnyi and others have obtained threshold densities for the existence of certain subgraphs in a random graph ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 , corollaries 15 ) ) . in earlier applications of random graphs to geometric group theory , this feature of the model was successfully exploited in order to analyze the geometry of right - angled artin and coxeter groups presented by random graphs ; this is notable , for example , in the work of charney and farber @xcite . in particular , the presence of an induced square implies non - hyperbolicity of the associated right - angled coxeter group  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we take a more global approach .",
    "earlier work established a correspondence between some fundamental geometric properties of right - angled coxeter groups and large - scale structural properties of the presentation graph , rather than local properties such as the presence or absence of certain specified subgraphs .",
    "the simplest of these properties is the property of being the join of two subgraphs that are not cliques .",
    "one large scale graph property relevant in the present context is a property studied in  @xcite which , roughly , says that the graph is constructed in a particular organized , inductive way from joins . in this paper , we discuss a refined version of this property , @xmath2 , which is a slightly - modified version of a property introduced by dani  thomas  @xcite .",
    "we also study a stronger property , @xmath1 , and show it is generic in random graphs for a large range of @xmath18 , up @xmath19 .",
    "the first class of graphs we study is the class of _ augmented suspensions _ , which we denote @xmath1 .",
    "a graph is an augmented suspension if it contains an induced subgraph which is a suspension ( see section  [ sec : definitions ] for a precise definition of this term ) , and any vertex which is not in that suspension is connected by edges to at least two nonadjacent vertices of the suspension .",
    "intriguingly , kahle proved that a function similar to the critical density in theorem  [ thm : as_upper2 ] is the threshold for a random simplicial complex to have vanishing second rational cohomology @xcite .",
    "note that property @xmath1 is not monotone increasing , since it requires the presence of a number of non - edges .",
    "in particular , complete graphs are not in @xmath1 .",
    "thus unlike the global properties typically studied in the theory of random graphs , @xmath1 will cease to hold a.a.s .  when the density @xmath4 is very close to @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.9 ) shows that if @xmath20 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath0 is either a clique or a clique minus a fixed number of edges whose endpoints are all disjoint .",
    "thus , with positive probability , @xmath21 .",
    "however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) shows that if @xmath22 then @xmath0 is asymptotically almost surely a clique , and hence not in @xmath1 .      the second family of graphs , which we call _ @xmath2 graphs _",
    "( `` constructed from squares '' ) , arise naturally in geometric group theory in the context of the large  scale geometry of right  angled coxeter groups , as we explain below and in section  [ sec : application_to_racg ] .",
    "a special case of these graphs was introduced by dani ",
    "thomas to study divergence in triangle - free right - angled coxeter groups @xcite .",
    "the graphs we study are intimately related to a property called _ thickness _ , a feature of many key examples in geometric group theory and low dimensional topology that is closely related to divergence , relative hyperbolicity , and a number of other topics .",
    "this property is , in essence , a connectivity property because it relies on a space being `` connected '' through sequences of `` large '' subspaces . roughly speaking",
    ", a graph is @xmath2 if it can be built inductively by chaining ( induced ) squares together in such a way that each square overlaps with one of the previous squares along a diagonal ( see section  [ sec : definitions ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "we explain in the next section how this class of graphs generalizes @xmath1 .",
    "our next result about genericity of @xmath2 combines with proposition  [ prop : thick_of_order_1 ] below to significantly strengthen  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  vi ) .",
    "this result is an immediate consequence of theorems  [ thm : cfs ] and  [ thm : cfs lower bound ] , which , in fact , establish slightly more precise , but less concise , bounds .",
    "we actually show , in theorem  [ thm : cfs ] , that at densities above @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , the random graph is a.a.s . in @xmath2 , while in theorem  [ thm : cfs lower bound ] we show a random graph a.a.s . not in @xmath2 at densities below @xmath25 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cfs ] applies to graphs in a range strictly larger than that in which theorem  [ thm : as_upper2 ] holds ( though our proof of theorem  [ thm : cfs ] relies on theorem  [ thm : as_upper2 ] to deal with the large @xmath4 case ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cfs ] combines with theorem  [ thm : not_augsusp ] to show that , for densities between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , a random graph is asymptotically almost surely in @xmath2 but not in @xmath1 .",
    "we also note that babson  hoffman ",
    "kahle @xcite proved that a function of order @xmath28 appears as the threshold for simple - connectivity in the linial ",
    "meshulam model for random 2complexes @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to understand whether there is a connection between genericity of the @xmath2 property and the topology of random 2-complexes .    unlike our results for the @xmath1 property",
    ", we do not establish a sharp threshold for the @xmath2 property .",
    "in fact , we believe that neither the upper nor lower bounds , given in theorem  [ thm : cfs ] and theorem  [ thm : cfs lower bound ] , for the critical density around which @xmath2 goes from a.a.s .",
    "not holding to a.a.s .  holding are sharp .",
    "indeed , we believe that there is a sharp threshold for the @xmath2 property located at @xmath29 . this conjecture is linked to the emergence of a giant component in the `` square graph '' of @xmath0 ( see the next section for a definition of the square graph and the heuristic discussion after the proof of theorem  [ thm : cfs lower bound ] ) .",
    "our interest in the structure of random graphs was sparked largely by questions about the large - scale geometry of _ right - angled coxeter groups_. coxeter groups were first introduced in  @xcite as a generalization of reflection groups , i.e. , discrete groups generated by a specified set of reflections in euclidean space .",
    "a reflection group is _ right - angled _ if the reflection loci intersect at right angles .",
    "an abstract right - angled coxeter group generalizes this situation : it is defined by a group presentation in which the generators are involutions and the relations are obtained by declaring some pairs of generators to commute .",
    "right - angled coxeter groups ( and more general coxeter groups ) play an important role in geometric group theory and are closely - related to some of that field s most fundamental objects , e.g. cat(0 ) cube complexes  @xcite and ( right - angled ) bruhat - tits buildings ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a right - angled coxeter group is determined by a unique finite simplicial _",
    "presentation graph _ : the vertices correspond to the involutions generating the group , and the edges encode the pairs of generators that commute .",
    "in fact , the presentation graph uniquely determines the right - angled coxeter group  @xcite . in this paper , as an application of our results on random graphs , we continue the project of understanding large - scale geometric features of right - angled coxeter groups in terms of the combinatorics of the presentation graph , begun in  @xcite . specifically , we study right - angled coxeter groups defined by random presentation graphs , focusing on the prevalence of two important geometric properties : _ relative hyperbolicity _ and _",
    "thickness_.    relative hyperbolicity , in the sense introduced by gromov and equivalently formulated by many others  @xcite , when it holds , is a powerful tool for studying groups .",
    "on the other hand , thickness of a finitely - generated group ( more generally , a metric space ) is a property introduced by behrstock  druu ",
    "mosher in  @xcite as a geometric obstruction to relative hyperbolicity and has a number of powerful geometric applications .",
    "for example , thickness gives bounds on divergence ( an important quasi - isometry invariant of a metric space ) in many different groups and spaces  @xcite .",
    "thickness is an inductive property : in the present context , a finitely generated group @xmath30 is _ thick of order @xmath31 _ if and only if it decomposes as the direct product of two infinite subgroups .",
    "the group @xmath30 is thick of order @xmath8 if there exists a finite collection @xmath32 of undistorted subgroups of @xmath30 , each thick of order @xmath33 , whose union generates a finite - index subgroup of @xmath30 and which has the following `` chaining '' property : for each @xmath34 , one can construct a sequence @xmath35 of cosets , with each @xmath36 , so that consecutive cosets have infinite coarse intersection .",
    "many of the best - known groups studied by geometric group theorists are thick , and indeed thick of order @xmath7 : one - ended right - angled artin groups , mapping class groups of surfaces , outer automorphism groups of free groups , fundamental groups of @xmath37dimensional graph manifolds , etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the class of coxeter groups contains many examples of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups .",
    "there is a criterion for hyperbolicity purely in terms of the presentation graph due to moussong @xcite and an algebraic criterion for relative hyperbolicity due to caprace @xcite .",
    "the class of coxeter groups includes examples which are non - relatively hyperbolic , for instance , those constructed by davis ",
    "januszkiewicz @xcite and , also , ones studied by dani  thomas @xcite .",
    "in fact , in  @xcite , this is taken further : it is shown that every coxeter group is actually either thick , or hyperbolic relative to a canonical collection of thick coxeter subgroups .",
    "further , there is a simple , structural condition on the presentation graph , checkable in polynomial time , which characterizes thickness .",
    "this result is needed to deduce the applications below from our graph theoretic results .",
    "charney and farber initiated the study of _ random graph products _ ( including right - angled artin and coxeter groups ) using the erds - rnyi model of random graphs  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the group cohomology of random graph products was obtained in @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", various results are proved about which random graphs have the thickness property discussed above , leading to the conclusion that , at certain low densities , random right - angled coxeter groups are relatively hyperbolic ( and thus not thick ) , while at higher densities , random right - angled coxeter groups are thick . in this paper , we improve significantly on one of the latter results , and also prove something considerably more refined : we isolate not just thickness of random right - angled coxeter groups , but thickness of a specified order , namely @xmath7 :    corollary  [ cor : high_density ] significantly improves on theorem  3.10 of  @xcite , as discussed in section  [ sec : application_to_racg ] .",
    "this theorem follows from theorems  [ thm : cfs ] and [ thm : as_upper2 ] , the latter being needed to treat the case of large @xmath18 , including the interesting special case in which @xmath4 is constant .",
    "we note that characterizations of thickness of right - angled coxeter groups in terms of the structure of the presentation graph appear to generalize readily to graph products of arbitrary finite groups and , probably , via the action on a cube complex constructed by ruane and witzel in  @xcite , to arbitrary graph products of finitely generated abelian groups , using appropriate modifications of the results in  @xcite .      in section  [ sec :",

    "testing for @xmath1 by examining each block and determining whether it witnesses @xmath1 takes @xmath411 steps , where @xmath8 is the number of vertices .",
    "the @xmath2 property is harder to detect , but essentially reduces to determining the component structure of the square graph .",
    "the square graph can be produced in polynomial time and , in polynomial time , one can find its connected components and check the support of these components in the original graph .",
    "using our software , we tested random graphs in @xmath3 for membership in @xmath1 for @xmath412 and @xmath413 . for each pair @xmath414 of this type",
    ", we generated @xmath415 random graphs and tested each for membership in @xmath1 .",
    "( this number of tests ensures that , with probability approximately @xmath416 , the measured proportion of @xmath1 graphs is within at most @xmath417 of the actual proportion . )",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : as_picture ] .",
    "the data suggests that , fixing @xmath8 , the probability that a random graph is in @xmath1 increases monotonically in the range of @xmath4 we are considering , rising sharply from almost zero to almost one .      in figure",
    "[ fig : cfs_prevalence_pt ] , we display the results of testing random graphs for membership in @xmath2 for @xmath419 and @xmath420 . for each pair @xmath414 of this type",
    ", we generated @xmath415 random graphs and tested each for membership in @xmath2 .",
    "( this number of tests ensures that , with probability approximately @xmath416 , the measured proportion of @xmath1 graphs is within at most @xmath417 of the actual proportion . )",
    "the data suggests that , fixing @xmath8 , the probability that a random graph is in @xmath2 increases monotonically in considered range of @xmath4 : rising sharply from almost zero to almost one inside a narrow window .",
    "[ rem : block_core_size ] for each graph @xmath0 tested , the @xmath1 software also keeps track of how many nonadjacent pairs @xmath128",
    " i.e. , how many blocks  were tested before finding one sufficient to verify membership in @xmath1 ; if no such block is found , then all non - adjacent pairs have been tested and the graph is not in @xmath1 . at densities near the threshold , this number of blocks is generally very large compared to the number of blocks tested at densities above the threshold .",
    "for example , in one instance with @xmath422 , verifying that the graph was in @xmath1 was accomplished after testing just @xmath423 blocks , while at @xmath424 , a typical test checked all @xmath425 blocks ( expected number : @xmath426 ) before concluding that the graph is not @xmath1 . at the same @xmath427",
    ", another test found that the graph was in @xmath1 , but only after @xmath428 tests .",
    "this data is consonant with the spirit of our proofs of theorem  [ thm : not_augsusp ] and theorem  [ thm : as_upper2 ] : in the former case , we showed that no `` good '' block exists , while in the latter we show that every block is good .",
    "we believe that right at the threshold we should have some intermediate behavior , with the expected number of `` good '' blocks increasing continuously from @xmath31 to @xmath429 .    what is more , we expect that the more precise threshold for the @xmath1 property , coinciding with the appearance of a single `` good '' block , should be located `` closer '' to our lower bound than to our upper one , i.e. , at @xmath430 , where @xmath431 is a sequence of strictly positive real numbers tending to @xmath31 as @xmath12 ( most likely decaying at a rate just faster than @xmath432 , see below ) . our experimental data , which exhibit a steep rise in @xmath418 strictly before the value @xmath153 hits one , gives some support to this guess .",
    "finally , our observations on the number of blocks suggests a natural way to understand the influence of higher - order terms on the emergence of the @xmath1 property : at exactly the threshold for @xmath1 , the event @xmath433 that a pair of non - adjacent vertices @xmath219 gives rise to a `` good '' block is rare and , despite some mild dependencies , the number @xmath434 of pairs @xmath219 for which @xmath433 occurs is very likely to be distributed approximatively like a poisson random variable .",
    "the probability @xmath435 would then be a very good approximation for @xmath418 .",
    "`` good '' blocks would thus play a role for the emergence of the @xmath1 property in random graphs analogous to that of isolated vertices for connectivity in random graphs .",
    "when @xmath436 , the expectation of @xmath434 is roughly @xmath437 .",
    "this expectation is @xmath321 when @xmath438 and is @xmath439 when @xmath440 .",
    "this suggest that the emergence of @xmath1 should occur when @xmath431 decays just a little faster than @xmath441 .",
    "[ rem : cfs speculation ] our data suggests that the prevalence of @xmath2 is closely related to the emergence of a giant component in the square graph . indeed , below the experimentally observed threshold for @xmath2 , not only is the support of the largest component in the square graph not all of @xmath129 , but in fact the size of the support of the largest component is an extemely small proportion of the vertices ( see figure  [ fig : cfs_largecomponent_pt ] ) .      in the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph , a giant component emerges when @xmath4 is around @xmath442 , i.e. , when vertices begin to expect at least one neighbor ; this corresponds to a paradigmatic condition of expecting at least one child for survival of a galton  watson process ( see  @xcite for a modern treatment of the topic ) . the heuristic observation",
    "that when @xmath443 the vertices of a diagonal @xmath444 in a fixed @xmath61-cycle @xmath67 expect to be adjacent to @xmath445 vertices outside the @xmath61-cycle , giving rise to an expected @xmath446 new @xmath61-cycles connected to @xmath67 through @xmath444 in @xmath60 suggests that @xmath447 could be a reasonable guess for the location of the threshold for the @xmath2 property . our data ,",
    "although not definitive , appears somewhat supportive of this guess : see figure  [ fig : cfs_largecomponent_pt ] which is based on the same underlying data set as figure  [ fig : cfs_prevalence_pt ] .",
    "we note that unlike an erds  rnyi random graph , the square graph @xmath60 exhibits some strong local dependencies , which may make the determination of the exact location of its phase transition a much more delicate affair .    for comparison with the threshold data for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we include below a similar figure of experimental data for connectivity for @xmath153 from @xmath448 to @xmath449 , where @xmath450",
    ". given what we know about the thresholds for connectivity and the @xmath1 property , this last set of data together with figure  [ fig : as_picture ] should serve as a warning not to draw overly strong conclusions : the graphs we tested are sufficiently large for the broader picture to emerge , but probably not large enough to allow us to pinpoint the exact location of the threshold for @xmath2 ."
