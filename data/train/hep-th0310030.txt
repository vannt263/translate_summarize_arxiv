    "string theory originated as an attempt to understand strong interactions and in particular the hadronic spectrum .",
    "later it was superseded by qcd which successfully explained the experimental data on deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) and other processes involving large energy scales where , due to asymptotic freedom , the coupling constant was small . in spite of that success ,",
    "the problem of computing the hadronic spectrum in qcd is still unsolved . to study",
    "this problem t hooft proposed to consider gauge theories in the limit of large number of colors @xcite a limit in which the gauge theory actually seems to behave as a theory of strings .",
    "interestingly , for certain 4-dimensional gauge theories , this idea was recently put in a remarkably precise form by maldacena through the ads / cft correspondence@xcite . in its",
    "most studied example , the conjectured ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides a description of the large n limit of @xmath1 su(n ) sym theory as type iib string theory on @xmath4 .",
    "starting from there , much understanding has been gained on the behavior of other sym theories in the t hooft limit .",
    "in particular in this paper we consider the @xmath3 background which was derived in @xcite and is dual to a cascading theory .",
    "this field theory is somewhat peculiar and we describe its properties in section [ sec : ktbkg ] .",
    "returning for a moment to qcd , in the comparison of theory with experiments an important role is played by twist two operators which are operators with the lowest conformal dimension ( in the free theory ) for a given spin .",
    "they give the leading contribution at large momentum transfer for scattering of leptons by hadrons ( dis)@xcite .",
    "their anomalous dimensions determine the corrections to bjorken scaling of the cross section which is a fundamental point in comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "it is natural then to wonder if these anomalous dimensions can be computed using ads / cft in the strongly coupled regime .",
    "unfortunately there is still no known dual to qcd but in the case of @xmath1 sym such calculation can be done . in the @xmath1 theory",
    "one can construct the following operators : @xmath5 where @xmath6 indicates traceless symmetrization . in the free theory",
    ", they have the property of being the spin @xmath7 operators with smallest conformal dimension @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath9 , with",
    "@xmath10 fixed and large the corresponding calculation was done in @xcite .",
    "what they found in that paper was that , in the large t hooft coupling regime , the operator with smallest conformal dimension for a given spin is dual ( in the ads / cft sense ) to a rotating string in global @xmath11 .",
    "it was not clear that such operators were the same as those with the same property at small coupling , namely ( [ eq : t2op ] ) .",
    "it was suggestive nevertheless that at strong coupling , the anomalous dimensions behaved as @xmath12 for large spin @xmath7 .",
    "the point is that a similar logarithmic behavior is found in perturbation theory at 1-loop @xcite and 2-loops @xcite for operators of the type ( [ eq : t2op ] ) suggesting an identification between them and the rotating strings .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    "this idea was confirmed by using known field theory arguments to relate the computation of the anomalous dimension of twist two operators to the evaluation of a certain light - like wilson loop .",
    "this wilson loop can be evaluated using ads / cft and gives the same result ( [ eq : andim ] ) .",
    "this alternative method is applied directly in poincare coordinates where the boundary is .",
    "this is useful since many backgrounds are known , or become simpler , in these coordinates .",
    "it also makes evident the use of symmetries in the problem .",
    "for example the logarithmic dependence in the spin @xmath7 follows automatically from lorentz invariance .",
    "moreover , in the case of , the surface that computes the relevant wilson loop can be found using only symmetry arguments . this type of calculation was extended to other cases in @xcite .    as a comment ,",
    "let us emphasize that even if both methods use the ads / cft correspondence , they do so in a very different way and that such agreement should exist is not at all obvious from supergravity .",
    "this agreement also shows that , although the identification of rotating strings and twist two operators goes beyond the usual identification between supergravity modes and chiral primary operators ( in the spirit of@xcite ) , in a certain sense that identification is contained in the identification between wilson loops and string world - sheets .",
    "clearly this last identification @xcite also goes beyond supergravity since it makes explicit use of string world - sheets .",
    "in view of the interest of twist two operators in qcd , it is important to repeat the @xmath1 calculation in other , less supersymmetric backgrounds .",
    "the anomalous dimension is an ultraviolet property of the theory so we have to study backgrounds which are not asymptotically @xmath13 since an asymptotically @xmath13 background will give the same result as .",
    "one such background is the klebanov - strassler @xcite that we mentioned before . in section [ sec : wl ]",
    "we compute the anomalous dimension of twist two operators in that background .",
    "after that , we also perform the rotating string calculation and compare the leading order results finding agreement between the two methods . in order to do that we need to use a different coordinate system and a different solution from the one used in @xcite .",
    "the solution we use is an euclidean world - sheet ending on a light - like line .",
    "the reason being that in that case the relevant part of the world - sheet is completely contained in the uv region of the background and we can use the klebanov - tseytlin solution .",
    "this is reasonable since the anomalous dimension is a uv property of the theory .",
    "as we shall see using this world - sheet also seems appropriate since the twist two operators appear in the taylor expansion of a bilocal operator containing a light - like wilson line which is precisely where the world - sheet ends .",
    "the calculation of the anomalous dimensions of twist two operators can be done in supergravity using rotating strings @xcite or wilson loops @xcite . since",
    "the method using wilson loops is formulated in poincare coordinates , it can be directly applied in this case .",
    "nevertheless we shall see presently that the rotating string method , after a small modification of the original calculation , can also be applied in poincare coordinates    in this section we review both methods for the case @xmath1 sym .      following @xcite , to compute the anomalous dimension of an operator using rotating strings , we should use a state operator map .",
    "such a map consists in first doing a wick rotation from @xmath14 into euclidean space and then a conformal transformation from @xmath15 to @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "finally we do a wick rotation on the @xmath19 to get a theory on @xmath20 in lorentzian signature .",
    "if the theory is conformally invariant we obtain the same theory on @xmath20 and the conformal dimension of an operator in @xmath14 maps into the energy of a corresponding state in @xmath20 .",
    "the problem of finding the operator of lowest conformal dimension for a given spin becomes the problem of finding the state of lowest energy for a given spin . in the limit @xmath9 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 finite and large",
    "we can use the ads / cft correspondence@xcite .",
    "@xmath1 sym in this limit is dual to @xmath11 in global coordinates .",
    "the metric is : @xmath23 the state of minimal energy for a given spin @xmath7 turns out to be a string with its center of mass fixed at @xmath24 and rotating with spin @xmath7 . for large spin the energy of that string",
    "is ( at leading order ) @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 . after identifying @xmath27",
    "this formula becomes eq.([eq : andim ] ) .",
    "for the purpose of the following sections it is useful to repeat the calculation in a slightly different way . the idea is to do the double wick rotation directly in the solution .",
    "we obtain then an euclidean world - sheet completely contained in the poincare patch .",
    "this is actually equivalent to using a system of coordinates such that scale transformations and boosts correspond to translations in certain coordinates . in that way , the conserved momenta of the solution",
    "are directly related to the conformal dimension and eigenvalue under a boost , without the need of any wick rotations .",
    "this coordinate system , as well as other related coordinates are described in detail in appendix a. here we just state its relation to poincare coordinates : @xmath28 from here we see first that @xmath29 , _ i.e_this patch is embedded in the poincare patch , and second that @xmath30 implying that only that region is covered which will turn out to be enough for our purposes .",
    "the metric in this new coordinates is @xmath31 which has as explicit isometries translations in @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 giving rise to three conserved momenta @xmath35 .",
    "translations in @xmath32 correspond to scale transformations @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and then we should identify @xmath39 with the conformal dimension @xmath40 .",
    "translations in @xmath33 and @xmath34 correspond to boosts and rotations respectively .",
    "as discussed before , in global coordinates @xmath41 was identified with the energy but that depended on a double wick rotation . here",
    "no wick rotation is necessary since the generator of scale transformations and @xmath32 translations are the same .",
    "the ` rotating ' string solution is now an euclidean world - sheet given by @xmath42 which determines the momenta to be : @xmath43 where we used the world - sheet euclidean coordinate @xmath32 as ( world - sheet ) time to define the conserved charges . expanding this integrals for large spin @xmath7",
    "we obtain the result : @xmath44 which is the same as ( [ rotstringn4 ] ) after using @xmath45 .    in poincare",
    "coordinates the solution ( [ rotansatzn4 ] ) reads @xmath46 this world - sheet is depicted in figure [ fig : rotstring ] .",
    "notice that as @xmath47 the string extends along @xmath48 at a small value of @xmath49 , namely in the uv of the field theory .",
    "this is in agreement with the field theory expectations since the anomalous dimension is a uv quantity , the usual rotating string calculation seems to mix uv and ir .",
    "this is not important for the conformal case but is relevant for the non - conformal one we discuss later on .    as an aside note also that as @xmath32 goes to infinity which is the relevant limit to compute the anomalous dimension , the string extends , as we just said , along the light - like line @xmath48 .",
    "it will be interesting to understand if this is in some way related to the wilson loop calculation which also uses light - like lines in the boundary .",
    "on the other hand it seems to be related to the fact that the twist two operators appear in the expansion of a bilocal operator which contains a light - like wilson line as we see from eq.([eq : osd ] ) below .      in gauge field theories there is a way to compute the anomalous dimensions of large spin , twist two operators using wilson loops @xcite .",
    "the argument starts by considering the bilocal operator : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a fixed light - like vector and the wilson line is in the adjoint representation ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the operators @xmath53 are the ( space - time ) component of the operators ( [ eq : t2op ] ) with maximum helicity along @xmath54 .",
    "matrix elements of this operator require renormalization which give rise to an anomalous dimension .",
    "in particular we can compute matrix elements between one particle states of the field @xmath55 with momentum @xmath56 .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the limit @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath58 and that , in that limit , such matrix elements can be computed using wilson loops .",
    "the relevant wilson loops have an anomalous dimension due to the fact that they have cusps .",
    "generically , for a wilson loop with a cusp of angle @xmath59 the expectation value behaves as @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an uv cutoff . in our case",
    "it turns out that @xmath62 which diverges for @xmath63 .",
    "in such regime the cusp anomaly behaves as @xcite : @xmath64 using this result one can see that the anomalous dimension is given by : @xmath65 what is left now is to compute @xmath66 . to summarize , one should compute a wilson loop with the shape of a wedge such as that in fig.[fig : cuspn4 ] where both sides approach the light - like lines @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in that limit",
    "the expectation value should behave as in ( [ eq : cuspw ] ) with @xmath69 as in eq.([eq : gdiv ] ) . after extracting the constant @xmath66 ,",
    "we can use ( [ eq : adfwl ] ) and get the anomalous dimension . a wilson loop as that in fig.[fig : cuspn4 ]",
    "can be computed by using a surface of minimal area in with metric @xmath70 and ending at @xmath71 on the lines @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "such surface turns out to be given simply by the equation @xmath72 .",
    "the area @xmath73  of such surface is divergent but we can regulate it as : @xmath74 which , using that @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 implies that @xmath78 .",
    "this calculation is actually for a wilson loop in the fundamental .",
    "since we need a wilson loop in the adjoint we should multiply the result by a factor of two . taking this into account and using formula ( [ eq : adfwl ] )",
    "we obtain the conformal dimension @xmath79 actually , the surface @xmath72 has a simple expression in embedding coordinates which can be obtained from symmetry arguments alone .",
    "a comment is that one can be more rigorous and find a surface ending on two space - like lines and take the limit in which they become light - like obtaining the same result .",
    "the fact that the anomalous dimension behaves as @xmath80 for large @xmath7 depends on the fact that the cusp anomaly @xmath81 diverges linearly in @xmath59 for large @xmath59 . in the wilson loop calculation",
    "this follows from the fact that the integrand in eq.([eq : n4area ] ) does not depend on @xmath82 which is a consequence of lorentz invariance .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the fact that the anomalous dimension behaves as @xmath80 @xcite appears as a consequence of lorentz invariance also in the field theory calculation .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the symmetries determine the behavior of the cusp anomaly for small euclidean angles .",
    "in fact , the flat metric @xmath83 , is invariant ( up to a conformal factor ) under the transformation @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath86 we can ignore the fact that such a transformation alters the periodicity of @xmath34 and obtain that @xmath87 is invariant only if @xmath88 .",
    "from supergravity we get @xmath89 with the expected behavior @xmath90 .",
    "the constant @xmath91 is given by @xcite : @xmath92 we can also compute the same result by using the quark anti - quark potential @xmath93 which was computed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , when @xmath86 the lines are almost parallel and the wilson loop should be @xmath94 and therefore the cusp anomaly is @xmath95 which agrees with eq.([eq : theta0 ] ) if we use ( [ eq : c ] ) and the value @xmath96 from @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the klebanov - tseytlin background and its field theory dual .",

    "the complex cone @xmath100 can be endowed with a khler metric whose khler potential depends only on @xmath107 which is actually the metric @xmath99}$ ] we are using .",
    "it follows that written in terms of the @xmath108 the khler potential has an @xmath109 symmetry which however is reduced to @xmath110 due to the condition @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath111 acts on the indices @xmath112 and the @xmath113 symmetry is @xmath114 .",
    "this @xmath110 is therefore an isometry of the metric ( [ eq : ktmetric ] ) .",

    "the functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 can be obtained by solving the equations of motion but will not be of interest here since we will need only the limit @xmath128 where this metric reduces to ( [ eq : ktmetric ] ) .",
    "going back to the metric ( [ eq : ktmetric ] ) we can observe that it is similar to @xmath11 but with @xmath129 replaced by @xmath101 . also , in we have @xmath130 . comparing with ( [ eq : h(r ) ] )",
    "we see that we can pictorially describe the background as with a ( logarithmically ) @xmath131 dependent radius @xmath132 .",
    "one can also define a radial dependent @xmath133 by integrating the @xmath134-form flux over @xmath135and obtaining @xmath136 since we know that with @xmath2 units of 5-form flux describe a theory with @xmath137 degrees of freedom , these qualitative considerations lead one to consider that the effective number of degrees of freedom changes with the radius , and therefore with the scale . this idea has actually been supported by thermodynamic arguments @xcite and from the analysis of @xmath138-point functions in this background @xcite .",
    "we should point out that since the kt background is singular at @xmath118 , the ks ( which resolves the singularity ) is necessary to understand the infrared properties of the theory but , since we are interested in the uv properties of the theory , which correspond to @xmath139 and both backgrounds behave similarly in that region , we can use the simpler background ( [ eq : ktmetric ] ) .      the dual field theory to ( [ eq : ktmetric ] )",
    "was suggested in @xcite and made precise in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the dual field theory can be described by a set of theories , each valid at a certain energy scale , which are @xmath3 gauge theories with gauge group @xmath140 .",

    "the gauge group @xmath0 is dualized to @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting that a careful application of seiberg duality shows that the dual theories have similar field content .",
    "we obtain in this way a cascade of theories which are the same except for the change in the gauge group ( we summarize the situation in fig.[fig : cascade ] ) .",

    "as we explained in section [ adimfwl ] , the anomalous dimension of twist two operators can be computed by finding a surface in the bulk which ends on a light - like wedge in the boundary . in order to do this",
    "it is convenient to write the metric ( [ eq : ktmetric ] ) using rindler coordinates ( @xmath169 ) in the plane ( @xmath170 ) : @xmath171 the surface in question is given by a function @xmath172 which minimizes the world - sheet action .",

    "this initial conditions should follow from the ir of the background but as we see are not relevant as long as we discard the exponentially suppressed terms .    going back to eq.([eqmotion ] ) we find , from ( [ yexp ] ) and ( [ trho ] ) that the asymptotic solution is @xmath223 .\\ ] ] the previous discussion was mainly to understand the properties of the equation and what the asymptotic expansion means . for the purpose of computing the anomalous dimension we will keep only the first term which gives , after replacing in the action @xmath224",
    "if we had chosen @xmath225 , inside the square root we would have got @xmath226 , namely a light - like surface as we said before .",
    "we can regulate the integrals in the action in the same manner as for the @xmath1 case , integrating the angle @xmath82 between @xmath227 and @xmath228 with @xmath229 and @xmath230 between @xmath231 and @xmath232 : @xmath233 the parameter @xmath232 should be understood as a uv cutoff since @xmath234 and then @xmath235 is the same as @xmath236 . in the cascade theory , if the steps of the cascade are large ( @xmath237 ) then one can introduce a uv cut - off for each theory ( _ e.g_@xmath238 in our previous notation ) but in the limit ( @xmath163 ) the steps of the cascade are small and the cutoff should be better understood as the energy scale @xmath142 at which we probe the cascade which just determines the value of @xmath239 that we have to use .",
    "then we identify @xmath240 where we identified @xmath241 up to a constant .",
    "we get then @xmath242 now we appeal to the definition of anomalous dimension @xmath243 and get @xmath244 which is linear in @xmath59 as expected from lorentz invariance .",
    "the proportionality coefficient is @xmath66 : @xmath245 from where the korchemsky - marchesini formula ( [ eq : adfwl ] ) gives the anomalous dimension @xmath246 where the extra factor of two appears because the wilson loop should actually be in the adjoint ( twice the fundamental ) . in the second equality we used the definition ( [ eq : ldef ] ) .",
    "this anomalous dimension is the main result of this section and of the paper . in the next section",
    "we reproduce it using rotating strings .",
    "the important difference with the @xmath1 case is that the theory is not conformally invariant and so the anomalous dimension depends on the scale and we have to use the appropriate definition of anomalous dimension as eigenvalues under infinitesimal scale transformations ( [ andimdef ] ) .",
    "incidentally taking the derivative ( [ andimdef ] ) provides a factor @xmath247 that makes the result agree with the rotating string calculation .",
    "here we do the rotating string calculation equivalent to the wilson loop calculation of the previous section . for",
    "that we will first consider the ks background ( [ eq : ksmetric ] ) @xmath248 we can do a coordinate transformation @xmath249 to render the metric into the form @xmath250 now the same coordinate transformation as in ( [ poinnew ] ) results in the metric : @xmath251 + ds_5 ^ 2(\\tau,\\rho )   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] naturally it is difficult to find the equivalent solution to that of eq.([rotansatzn4 ] ) in this background .",
    "however since we are interested in the asymptotic properties of the string in the uv , this corresponds to taking @xmath252 and we can use the klebanov - tseytlin solution . using a",
    "new radial coordinate @xmath253 and after an appropriate identification of the constants , we recover the metric ( [ eq : ktmetric ] ) .",
    "the transformation ( [ zdef ] ) becomes @xmath254 where the last equality is valid for large @xmath131 and we used that , as before , @xmath178 is given by @xmath255 note that since @xmath256 and @xmath257 the string never extends beyond @xmath258 , namely , we do not need to know the ir part of the background if @xmath259 . in this limit , and taking into account that the string does not extend into @xmath260 or the internal coordinates we can write the relevant part of the metric as @xmath261 now we compute , at leading order for large @xmath131 ( or large @xmath32 ) : @xmath262 within this approximation the metric becomes @xmath263 as a further approximation we can use that for @xmath47 , we have @xmath264 since @xmath265 and @xmath266 is fixed .",
    "so we finally get @xmath267 as a last approximation we note that @xmath268 and then an adiabatic approximation where @xmath32 is considered constant is appropriate ( for large @xmath32 ) . in this case",
    "we can define a @xmath32-dependent momentum @xmath269 which is the bulk equivalent of the fact that the anomalous dimension runs with the scale .",
    "namely , the theory is not scale invariant , but we can define for each scale a conformal dimension that contains the information of how an operator changes under an infinitesimal scale transformation . this conformal dimension is scale dependent because @xmath269 is @xmath32-dependent .    if we consider @xmath32 constant the calculation becomes the same calculation that we did in section [ adimfrt ] but after replacing @xmath270 in the metric ( [ n4metric ] ) .",
    "this gives ( [ n4rotstring ] ) with the same replacement @xmath270 : @xmath271 since at leading order we have @xmath272 and we identify @xmath131 with the scale @xmath142 the result reads @xmath273 in exact agreement with the wilson loop calculation ( [ wlresult ] ) .",
    "in the previous two sections we used the method of wilson loops and the one of rotating strings to compute anomalous dimensions of certain field theory operators . in this section",
    "we discuss in more detail which are the operators involved .",
    "a related discussion already appeared in @xcite .",
    "the first point is that since we are in the regime where the steps of the cascade are small compared to @xmath2 , the cascade should be considered as a continuum of theories . in that case",
    "the only operators that make sense are those that cascade nicely , that is that can be defined at each step of the cascade and preserve their form under the seiberg dualities .",
    "in section [ sec : ktbkg ] we studied the operators @xmath274 they can be generalized to bilocal operators : @xmath275 where we inserted a wilson line in the bi - fundamental of @xmath276 to preserve gauge invariance .",
    "these operators should cascade to @xmath277 since they are bilocal gauge invariant operators with the same transformation properties under the global symmetry @xmath147 .",
    "the actual operators that cascade nicely can differ from these ones by functions of the fundamental fields that are invariant under the global symmetries ( see @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "we just consider this discussion as evidence of the existence of such operators and use ( [ oij ] ) as a guide to understand their properties .",
    "if we expand ( [ oij ] ) in powers of @xmath278 we get a series of operators @xmath279 if we take , as we did before , @xmath278 to be light - like then the operators that survive in the contraction are those of maximum helicity , _ i.e _  a certain component of the operators of maximum spin that we can form for a given number of derivatives . since the number of derivatives determines the conformal dimension ( in the free theory ) these are the operators of lower twist",
    ". note that in that case the wilson line that appears in eq .",
    "( [ oij ] ) is light - like .",
    "if one tries to compute such a wilson line using the ads / cft correspondence the natural thing is to use a world - sheet that ends on such a line at the boundary .",
    "it is interesting to note that the world - sheet we considered , which appeared as a double wick rotation of the rotating string has precisely such property . it might be interesting to analyze this point further since a light - like wilson line is bps ( since its variation involves @xmath280 which satisfies @xmath281 ) .",
    "going back to our main point , it is reasonable to suggest that the operators whose anomalous dimension we are computing are precisely @xmath282 .",
    "however , we finalize by pointing out that one can use the vector multiplets to construct other operators which seem to cascade nicely and are invariant under the global symmetries . this is because under seiberg duality the field strength @xmath283 dualizes to @xmath284 .",
    "this operators should be also taken into account if a precise matching between supergravity and the field theory is required .",
    "however the supergravity calculation is presently not able to distinguish between all the possible twist two operators .",
    "the same happens in the @xmath1 case where there are several twist two operators ( [ eq : t2op ] ) .",
    "the way to distinguish between them is their transformation properties under the global symmetries and supersymmetry .",
    "the natural conjecture is that all operators that one can form have the same anomalous dimension for large spin .",
    "in this paper we extended previous calculations of anomalous dimensions of twist two operators that were done for @xmath1 sym theory to the cascading theories which have @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "the interesting difference is that in the @xmath3 case the anomalous dimension depends on the scale since the theory is not conformally invariant . to tackle",
    "the non - conformal case we needed to use a variation of the rotating string method which makes explicit use of the fact that the anomalous dimension is a uv property and then only the uv region of the background should be involved in the calculation .",
    "furthermore we did not use global coordinates since in the non - conformal case there is no state - operator map . in general , a similar calculation done in coordinates akin to global coordinates computes the energy of a certain high spin ` glueball ' state which is not directly related to the anomalous dimensions of an operator unless the theory is conformally invariant .",
    "our main interest was in the wilson loop method that can be easily applied in this case .",
    "it makes evident that the logarithmic behavior of the anomalous dimension is a consequence of lorentz invariance and so seems to be a generic property of all theories that have supergravity duals . in field theory",
    "it is known that those are gauge theories since in scalar theories twist two operators have vanishing anomalous dimension in the limit of large spin .    in view of the fact that certain wilson loops @xcite can be computed at strong coupling by summing over a subset of feynman diagrams we believe to be of high interest to see if a similar calculation can give the anomalous dimensions that are obtained from supergravity .",
