    "the ongoing accelerator based experiments in the search for new physics can solve some of the unanswered problems of the fundamental physics like matter - antimatter asymmetry . a complementary to these high energy experiments",
    "is the search for violation in spatial inversion ( @xmath5 ) and time reversal ( @xmath6 ) symmetries in nuclei , atoms or molecules in the low energy domain using non - accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "one of such @xmath0-violating interaction results into the electric dipole moment of electron ( eedm ) @xcite .",
    "the eedm predicted by the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics is too small ( @xmath7 e cm ) @xcite to be observed by the today s experiment .",
    "however , many extensions of the sm predict the value of eedm to be in the range of @xmath8 e cm @xcite and the sensitivity of the modern eedm experiment also lies in the same range . till date , the experiment done by acme collaboration @xcite using tho yields the best upper bound limit of eedm .",
    "the high sensitivity of modern eedm experiment is mainly due to the fact that heavy paramagnetic diatomic molecules offer a very high internal effective electric field ( @xmath9 ) , which enhances the eedm effects @xcite . in the experiment , both eedm and the coupling interaction between the scalar - hadronic current and the pseudoscalar electronic current",
    "contribute to the p , t - odd frequency shift .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to decouple the individual contribution from these two effects in a single experiment .",
    "however , it is possible to untwine these two contributions from each other and an independent limit on the value of eedm ( @xmath10 ) and scalar - pseudoscalar ( s - ps ) coupling constant ( @xmath11 ) can be obtained by using data from two different experiments as suggested by dzuba _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , an accurate value of the @xmath9 and the scalar - pseudoscalar ( s - ps ) @xmath0-odd interaction constant ( @xmath12 ) are needed since these two quantities can not be measured by means of any experiment .",
    "therefore , one has to rely on an accurate _ ab initio _ theory that can simultaneously take care of the effects of relativity and electron correlation for the calculation of these quantities .",
    "the best way to include the effects of special relativity in the electronic structure calculations is to solve the dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) equation in the four - component framework .",
    "the dhf method considers an average electron - electron interaction and thus misses the correlation between electrons having same spin . on the other hand , the single reference coupled - cluster ( srcc )",
    "method is the most preferred many - body theory to incorporate the dynamic part of the electron correlation .",
    "the calculation of property in the srcc framework can be done either numerically or analytically . in numerical method",
    "( also known as the finite - field ( ff ) method ) , the coupled - cluster amplitudes are functions of the external field parameters @xcite and thus , for calculations of each property , separate set of cc calculation is needed .",
    "the error associated with the ff method is also dependent on the method of calculation , i.e. , the number of data points considered for the numerical differentiation . on the contrary , in the analytical method",
    ", the cc amplitudes are independent of the external field of perturbation and therefore , one needs to solve only one set of cc equation for the calculations of any number of properties .",
    "normal cc ( ncc ) method being non - variational , does not satisfy the generalized hellmann - feynman ( ghf ) theorem and thus , the expectation value and the energy derivative approach are two different formalisms for the calculation of first order property .",
    "however , the energy derivative in ncc framework is the corresponding expectation value plus some additional terms which make it closer to the property value obtained in the full configuration interaction ( fci ) method .",
    "thus , the property value obtained in the energy derivative method is much more reliable than the corresponding expectation value method .",
    "another disadvantage of the expectation value method is that it leads to a non - terminating series and any truncation further introduces an additional error .",
    "the z - vector method @xcite ( an energy derivative method ) , on the other hand , leads to a naturally terminating series at any level of approximation .",
    "the higher order derivative in the ncc framework can be calculated by using the lagrange multiplier method @xcite and for the first order energy derivative , it leads to the identical equations as of z - vector method .",
    "it is worth to note that there are alternative options like expectation value cc ( xcc ) @xcite , unitary cc ( ucc ) @xcite , and extended cc ( ecc ) @xcite to solve the srcc equation .",
    "all these methods are known in the literature as the variational coupled - cluster ( vcc ) method @xcite .",
    "these vcc methods are well established in the non - relativistic framework but are not that much popular in the relativistic domain , a few are documented in the literature like relativistic ucc by sur _",
    "@xcite , applicable only for the purpose of atomic calculations .",
    "recently , sasmal _",
    "et al _ implemented ecc in the four - component relativistic domain to calculate the magnetic hyperfine structure ( hfs ) constants of both atoms and molecules in their open - shell ground state configuration @xcite .",
    "the ecc method being variational satisfies the ghf theorem , therefore , expectation value and the energy derivative approach are identical to each other .",
    "however , in ecc method amplitude equations for the excitation and de - excitation operators are coupled to each other , whereas , in z - vector method , the amplitude equations of excitation operator are decoupled from the amplitude equations of the de - excitation operator .",
    "this accelerates the convergence in the z - vector method with a lesser computational cost as compared to the ecc .    in this work ,",
    "we have calculated the @xmath2 and @xmath1 of raf in its ground electronic ( @xmath13 ) state using z - vector method in the cc framework .",
    "we also calculated these properties in the expectation value method to show the superiority of the z - vector method over the expectation value method .",
    "we have chosen the raf molecule for the following reasons : this molecule has been proposed for the @xmath5-odd and @xmath0-odd experiment @xcite due to its high schiff moment , @xmath9 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath2 of @xmath13 state of raf is even higher than the ground state ( @xmath13 ) of ybf .",
    "therefore , the more precise value of @xmath2 and @xmath1 and their ratio are very important for the eedm experiment using this molecule",
    ". raf can be directly laser cooled as it has high diagonal franck - condon matrix element between the ground and first excited electronic state and the corresponding transition frequency lies in the visible region with a reasonable lifetime @xcite .",
