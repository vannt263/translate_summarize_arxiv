    "light simple atoms are basically described by quantum electromagnetic theory . quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    "is well established and in particular it covers all interactions of leptons ( electrons and muons ) and photons .",
    "such a lepton - photon theory is obviously incomplete because even pure leptonic systems are not free of hadronic effects which enter through virtual hadronic intermediate states .",
    "effects of strong interactions can not be calculated _ ab initio _ and additional experimental data and/or phenomenological models are needed .",
    "here we consider qed tests with hyperfine splitting in light hydrogen - like atoms paying attention to both : basic _ ab initio _ qed theory and relatively small , but most uncertain , hadronic contributions .",
    "an application of qed to the bound state problem , bound state qed , is much more complicated than ordinary qed and it deserves serious tests .",
    "some of such tests are significant for the determination of fundamental constants and in particular of the fine structure constant @xmath2 , which may be obtained from the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) interval in muonium ( see reviews @xcite for more detail ) .    the hfs interval in hydrogen and some other light atoms has been known for a while with an experimental accuracy at the level of a part in @xmath3 .",
    "meanwhile , the related theory suffers from uncertainties of the nuclear structure effects at one - ppm level . here",
    ", we consider a few possibilities to perform qed tests going far beyond this level of accuracy .",
    "problems in accurate calculations of the proton or nuclear structure effects drew attention to studies of pure leptonic atoms such as a bound system of a positive muon and an electron , the muonium .",
    "in contrast to the hydrogen atom , the nucleus , a muon , is free of effects of strong interactions .",
    "nevertheless , those effects enter through hadronic vacuum polarization . that sets an ultimate limit on any qed tests with muonium .",
    "uncertainties of the qed theory and of calculations of the hadronic effects are presented in @xcite .",
    "muonium is of metrological interest due to determination of the fine structure @xmath2 , muon - to - electron mass ratio @xmath4 and some other fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the hadronic effects @xcite is similar to those for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite .",
    "it is based on the low energy @xmath5 data which accuracy , although fast improving , is still behind the measurement of the muon @xmath6 value @xcite .",
    "the current difference between the experimental value and its theoretical prediction differs from zero by almost three standard deviations @xcite .",
    "attempts to increase the accuracy of the prediction by adding data on the @xmath7 lepton decays revealed one more possible deviation from the standard model expectation @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    we summarize state - of - the - art in the precision tests of the bound state qed theory of the hyperfine structure in table  [ t : exp ] .",
    "the theoretical accuracy is limited by our ability to calculate higher - order radiative , recoil and radiative recoil effects ( see review @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "the higher - order contributions crucial for the uncertainty are related to the same diagrams and thus all tests listed in the table are really competitive .",
    "theory and experiment are generally in good agreement .",
    "there is a minor discrepancy for positronium up to approximately 3 standard deviations , but statistically that is acceptable if the tests as a whole are considered .",
    "the work was supported in part by dfg and rfbr ( under grant # 06 - 02 - 16156 ) .",
