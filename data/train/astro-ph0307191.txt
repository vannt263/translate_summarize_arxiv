    "large cosmic voids provide a unique testbed for models of galactic formation and evolution ( peebles 2001 ) . in recent years",
    ", there has been intense effort to identify and study voids in a number of large surveys such as the iras 1.2 jy survey ( el - ad et al .",
    "1997 ) , the pscz redshift survey ( plionis & basilakos 2002 ; hoyle & vogeley 2002 ) , the las campanas redshift survey ( arbabi - bigdoli & mller 2002 ) and the updated zwicky catalog ( hoyle & vogeley 2002 )",
    ". observed large voids have typical diameters of @xmath4mpc , density contrast @xmath5 , and fill at least 40% of the universe ( hoyle & vogeley 2002 ) .",
    "the properties of galaxies in voids clearly differ from those in higher - density regions ( grogin & geller 1999a , b ; rojas et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "recent studies using samples of @xmath6 void galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey demonstrate that void galaxies are bluer , fainter , more disklike , and have higher specific star formation rates ( rojas et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "a variety of simulation methods has been applied to study formation of object in voids , including application of semi - analytic models ( sams ) to compute properties of galaxies associated with dark matter halos in cold dark matter simulations ( benson et al .",
    "2003 ; mathis & white 2002 ) , simulations including hydrodynamics ( ostriker et al . 2003 ) , and specialized high - resolution simulations of dark matter halos in voids ( gottlber et al .",
    "2003 ) . studying the characteristics of galaxies in the context of large - scale numerical simulations",
    "can be extremely costly because the region of interest represents only @xmath7 of the total mass of the simulation , and less than half the volume .",
    "thus , enormous amounts of computing time must be spent in order to study voids in a particular cosmological model .",
    "studies over many models naturally become even more difficult .    in principle , simulation of voids is far easier than simulation of a typical large patch of the universe , because voids are dynamically much simpler systems than clusters .",
    "large voids remain in the linear regime for relatively longer time and approach spherical symmetry for much of their evolution .",
    "birkhoff s theorem ( birkhoff 1923 ) tells us that the internal dynamics of a spherically symmetric system will be independent of the dynamics of the outside universe .",
    "this theorem has been applied in the development of spherically symmetric infall models for galaxies ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; schechter 1980 ) , cluster infall regions ( regs & geller 1989 ) , for large - scale inhomogeneities in general ( silk 1974 ) , and for studying the population of ly@xmath8 clouds in voids ( manning 2002 ) .",
    "voids can be approximated as expanding , isolated universes unto themselves which do not accrete matter from the universe at large . as we describe below , this is only an approximation , but one that is useful for studying formation of objects well within the edges of voids .",
    "we propose to exploit this simplicity to simulate universes entirely composed of void - like regions . a patch anywhere within such a simulation would mimic the interior of a large void and allow investigation of such issues as : what are galaxies like in such a universe ? at what epoch",
    "did they form ?",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [",
    "sec : parameters ] , we derive the basic relations between the cosmological parameters : expansion coefficients , and local values of @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in the void region and outside of it . in  [ sec : powerspec ] , we discuss the primordial power spectrum which should be used in running the simulations .",
    "details of applying this approach are discussed in  [ sec : recipe ] . in  [ sec : massfunc ] , we discuss the results of a small simulation meant as a `` sanity check '' on the proposed method . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : future ] , we discuss these results and future applications .",
    "we can use birkhoff s theorem to explore the physics of underdense regions , because voids have the properties that they are largely isolated throughout their evolution , and they are roughly spherical .",
    "birkhoff s theorem tells us that a spherically symmetric region with specified mean density , cosmological constant density , radius @xmath11 , and expansion rate @xmath12 will evolve exactly like a universe with a hubble constant @xmath13 , and a mean density equal to that of the spherical region .",
    "the growth of perturbations within that region will exactly mimic ( up to long - range tidal forces ) structure growth in a universe with the fiducial cosmology .    for the purpose of our discussion ,",
    "we assume a background cosmology with a pure cdm+baryon matter density of @xmath14 at the present ( throughout , we will use the convention that a subscript `` 0 '' denotes the value of the parameter at the present ) .",
    "all calculations assume a negligible density of relativistic matter .",
    "the matter density parameter may be expressed as @xmath15 .",
    "we also assume a known cosmological constant @xmath16 with corresponding density parameter @xmath1 .    at an arbitrarily high redshift , when the scale factor @xmath17 , consider a spherical underdense region with physical size @xmath18 ( henceforth , subscript `` v '' denotes a property of the void region ) .",
    "if the density contrast of the void is @xmath19 , then the mass contained in the region is , of course , @xmath20\\frac{\\rho_0}{a(t)^3 } \\label{eq : masscons}\\ ] ] which is a conserved quantity at all times . for reasons of convenience",
    ", we also define the dimensionless variable @xmath21 which , at very early times , gives @xmath22 . from equations ( [ eq :",
    "masscons],[eq : aveq ] ) we get the relation @xmath23    if the void is spherically symmetric , its evolution is described by the friedmann equation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , the cosmological constant within the void , is identical to @xmath16 in the rest of the universe ( thus the subscript @xmath26 will be dropped from this term in subsequent discussion ) . @xmath27 is the ( presently unknown ) radius of curvature within the void , and @xmath28 is the sign of the curvature within the void .",
    "the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : fried1 ] ) may be simplified considerably .",
    "equation ( [ eq : masscons ] ) yields the relation @xmath29    from this , we may expand the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : fried1 ] ) as @xmath30 where we have substituted @xmath31 for the right - hand side of the friedmann equation of the background cosmology .",
    "note that this substitution assumes the background cosmology is spatially flat .",
    "it is a trivial , albeit algebraically messy exercise to extend this analysis to the case of non - flat background cosmologies .",
    "note also that in pathologically closed universes , the void itself may be closed as well .",
    "we may also use equation ( [ eq : deltareq ] ) to expand the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : fried1 ] ) as @xmath32 prior to equation ( [ eq : lhs1 ] ) , the relations we derive are fully general .",
    "however , the second two equalities in equation ( [ eq : lhs1 ] ) only hold at extremely early times in the evolution of the void , since at early times @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    equations ( [ eq : rhs1],[eq : lhs1 ] ) may be combined , yielding ( at early times only ) @xmath35 substituting , once again , @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath37 where we have substituted @xmath38 ( necessarily the case for an underdense void in a flat cosmology ) , or @xmath39 it is clear that @xmath40 at all times .",
    "thus , by looking at the limiting case of @xmath41 , we find at all times @xmath42 where the term in the radical is a constant provided @xmath43 is selected sufficiently early .",
    "this ratio may be given as a fixed parameter of the model .",
    "as we will see , the ratio @xmath44 together with the parameters of the background cosmology ( @xmath45 ) completely constrain the evolution of the void region .",
    "we will compute the final underdensity of the region , @xmath46 , the equivalent density parameter , @xmath47 , the equivalent cosmological constant , @xmath48 , and the equivalent hubble constant , @xmath49 as a function of the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "having specified @xmath50 , we may again write the general form of the friedmann equation within the void ( valid for all times ) @xmath51 to proceed , we need to solve a boundary value problem using equation ( [ eq : fried2 ] ) . by integrating from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , and given the constraint that at early times , @xmath22 , we solve for the parameter @xmath54 because the void region expands faster than the background universe , @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 , and we obtain the relationships for the density contrast and effective cosmological parameters in the void at the present epoch , in terms of the parameter @xmath8 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the corresponding `` density '' parameter of the curvature term in the friedmann equation , such that @xmath59 .    in the limit of @xmath60 , equation  ( [ eq : delta ] )",
    "reduces to the linear growth relation discussed in , for example , carroll , press & turner ( 1992 ; see also lahav et al .",
    "1991 ; lightman & schechter 1990 ) , @xmath61^{-1}\\\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : growth ] illustrates the different growth rates and expansion factors for the void region and background cosmology .",
    "however , voids may reach well into the @xmath62 regime , thus the linear approximation is not valid and the void universe must be treated numerically . to accurately specify the effective cosmological parameters for large voids , we numerically integrate the friedmann equation for a range of values of @xmath50 .",
    "this integration yields the parameter @xmath8 and , from equation([eq : delta ] ) , the present - epoch void density contrast @xmath46 . by varying @xmath50 until the desired underdensity is found",
    ", we can compute the effective parameters of the void cosmology .    in figure  [ fig : params ]",
    ", we show the relationships between the density contrast of voids and the corresponding cosmological parameters which would be needed to model a universe with the appropriate age and dynamics .",
    "deeper voids expand faster , thus they have larger hubble constant @xmath63 .",
    "the matter density parameter @xmath0 is smaller , both because of the smaller average density and because of the larger hubble constant ( recall the definition @xmath64 ) .",
    "while the cosmological constant @xmath16 is identical in both the void and background , the corresponding density parameter @xmath1 is smaller in the void because the void expands faster . because voids act like very open universes , the latter reflects the phenomenon that dark energy is relatively less important in deep voids , which become curvature - dominated quite early .",
    "even with a large cosmological constant , structure formation in voids freezes out at early time in similar fashion to a low - density @xmath65 universe .",
    "these results show that a simulation run with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 would dynamically evolve just as the interior of a spherically - symmetric void with @xmath69 that resides within an @xmath70 flat universe .",
    "obviously , the density parameters for the different components of the non - relativistic matter ( @xmath71 ) should be scaled relative to those of the background cosmology in the same way .",
    "any patch within such a simulation would mimic the interior of a void , up to long - range tidal effects .",
    "however , as we discuss in the following section , we must also alter the input power spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "to correctly specify the input power spectrum for a simulation that seeks to model the interior of large voids , we must make allowance for two effects : first , the amplitude of the power spectrum of the density contrast must be adjusted relative to the power spectrum for the background cosmology , because the average matter density is smaller in voids .",
    "second , because we wish to simulate voids with fixed density contrast , we should remove power on scales larger than the characteristic scale of the voids themselves . here",
    "we discuss these constraints on the initial power spectrum in running a simulation of isolated void regions .",
    "again , the goal is to set up the initial conditions so that any region within the simulation looks like the inside of a large void , except for possible tidal effects near the edges of the void .",
    "let us begin by discussing the power spectrum on scales smaller than the void .",
    "consider that at the initial time , @xmath43 , the density fluctuations within some region can be given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the fourier transform of the density fluctuation field .",
    "if the initial conditions are gaussian , as in the current standard models for structure formation , then each of the fourier components is statistically independent . thus , the contribution to the real - space density field from a particular component is @xmath74 on small scales , linear independence means that the contribution to the density field from small scale modes is not dependent on whether we are looking at a region which will evolve into a void or a cluster . in void simulations of the type described above , @xmath75 in equation ( [ eq : fouriercomp ] )",
    "is the mean density in the void , not the background universe .",
    "thus , we need to apply a correction to the amplitude of each fourier mode , @xmath76 where a superscript , @xmath77 , denotes a random density component in the background cosmology . recall that @xmath78 , thus this correction is simply the ratio of the background density to the average density within the void .",
    "this correction yields the same _ mass _ perturbations caused by small wavelength fluctuations as in the background .",
    "note that in the limit of very high initial redshift this correction almost completely disappears .",
    "we also need to alter the input power spectrum on scales comparable to and larger than the void scale , to tailor our simulations to mimic only the interior of voids with specified density contrast",
    ". observed large voids have density contrast @xmath5 and typical radii @xmath79 mpc .",
    "if we consider that the entire simulation volume is meant to be a `` void region '' then no power should exist on scales much larger than @xmath80 .",
    "the variance of fluctuations on a a scale @xmath80 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the fourier transform of the spatial window @xmath83 over which the fluctuations are sampled ( e.g. , a spherical tophat or gaussian window ) and @xmath84 is the background power spectrum of fluctuations , @xmath85 .",
    "the effect of modifying the amplitude of the fourier components is to modify the power spectrum as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the squared modulus of the factor that multiplies each fourier component @xmath88 . on scales comparable to and larger than the void , we want to smooth away the very fluctuations that led to the creation of a void with density contrast @xmath89 ,",
    "such that the amplitude of _ suppressed _ power is @xmath90p^{(bg)}(k , t_i )   |\\hat{w}(kr)|^2 \\simeq \\delta_i^2 \\label{eq : sigmaout}\\ ] ] this suppresses sufficient power that the rms of the suppressed structure is similar to the mean underdensity of the void region .",
    "for example , applying a gaussian cutoff to large - scale power implies @xmath91\\ ] ] as the smoothing function ( where @xmath92 is the smoothing scale , selected to satisfy equation ( [ eq : sigmaout ] ) . the result will be little structure in the simulations at wavenumber @xmath93 .",
    "since we do not wish to run a serious of identically periodic voids , this implies that we should limit the size of the simulation box to @xmath94 . of course",
    ", limiting @xmath95 effectively removes power on large scales .",
    "note that the cutoff scale @xmath92 corresponds to a smaller comoving scale than the current void diameter , because all the wave modes within the void grow with time relative to the background .",
    "from above , the smoothing function should approach @xmath96 on small scales .",
    "together , the large and small - scale constraints yield the modified initial power spectrum for our void simulations : @xmath97}{(1-a_i\\eta)^2}\\right]\\ ] ]",
    "suppose we wish to simulate a void with density contrast @xmath46 ( which specifies the parameter @xmath8 ) and comoving diameter at @xmath98 of @xmath99 ( in units of @xmath100mpc , where @xmath101 is the dimensionless hubble parameter of the background cosmology ) .",
    "there are three separate steps that require careful accounting for the units of distance and scale factors in the void and background cosmologies : ( 1 ) generating initial density and velocity fields ; ( 2 ) setting parameters of the simulation code to evolve those fields ; and ( 3 ) translating void simulation results back into comoving coordinates of the background cosmology ( i.e. , back into _",
    "real _ comoving coordinates ) . here",
    "we review these steps .    to generate the initial density and velocity fields ,",
    "note that the fluctuations in the void region are those of a patch that has comoving size @xmath102 .",
    "this is smaller than the @xmath98 comoving size of the void region because the void has expanded relative to the background , thereby stretching all the wavemodes within it .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the fundamental mode of the simulation cube should be set by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 .",
    "the initial power spectrum must be generated using the _ background _ cosmological parameters , with amplitude correct for the specified initial redshift @xmath105 , but with shape and amplitude modified by the factor @xmath87 as discussed above . scaling the velocities ,",
    "both in the initial conditions and in the outputs is very code - specific , as it depends on the units .",
    "the input parameters for running the simulation include the void cosmological parameters , as well as the comoving box size , initial redshift , and final redshift .",
    "if specified in units of @xmath106mpc , the comoving box size should be set to @xmath107 .",
    "the initial redshift of the void simulation , @xmath108 , must be larger than the true @xmath105 , by @xmath109 .    to correctly interpret the results of the simulation ,",
    "we must account for the difference in scale factors and hubble constants in the background cosmology and the void simulation .",
    "this is because , although the void expands in comoving coordinates when embedded in the background , it does not , of course , grow in comoving coordinates when it sits inside the effective void cosmology . at @xmath98 , scales in the void simulation are exact when expressed in mpc ( not in @xmath106mpc ) .",
    "therefore , to get scales in the typical units of @xmath100mpc , we must multiply by the ratio of hubble constants , @xmath110 . at any other epoch ,",
    "we must also account for the different growth factors , thus the general expression is @xmath111 ( recall that , by definition , @xmath112 ) . at the initial redshift , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , as discussed above .",
    "in developing the formalism for a void - only simulation , we have made a number of simplifying assumptions , and objections may be raised as to whether the assumptions of spherical symmetry ( demanded by birkhoff s theorem ) or fixed total mass ( demanded by running the void in isolation ) are well - founded .    as a `` sanity check , '' we have run several relatively modest @xmath115 particle simulations of a @xmath116 void region .",
    "we used enzo ( norman & bryan 1999 ) , an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamics code that includes a grid that can adapt automatically to provide high - resolution in regions of interest . refinement was set to allow resolution down to @xmath117 the simulation box - size ( 25 @xmath100 mpc ) , approximately 50 @xmath100 kpc , and only gravitational forces were used .",
    "we then used the hop ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) group - finder to identify galaxies , and computed the mass - function of the dark matter halos in the void region .",
    "the results of this simulation can be found in figure  [ fg : mf ] .",
    "we compare the void - only simulation mass function with the mass function found by gottlber et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who simulated a large region of the universe , excised the void galaxies and computed their mass function . for consistency ,",
    "the results cited are based on their @xmath118 sample .",
    "we also compute a theoretical mass function based on press - schechter ( 1974 ) analysis of the spherical collapse of halos .",
    "the theoretical curves plotted represent voids of @xmath119 ( top ) , and @xmath116 ( bottom ) using the analytic form of goldberg et al .",
    "the form of sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) produces a nearly identical curve , but differs in assumption , since the goldberg et al .",
    "result assumes the fully nonlinear ( semi - analytic ) density contrast of the void , derived herein , and uses the size of the void as an additional bayesian prior .",
    "it is clear that at most masses , the void - only simulation produces an excellent fit with both larger simulations and purely analytic results .",
    "the slight discrepancy at the low - mass end can be attributed to limited force resolution in the present simulations . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : mf ] a simulation with no force refinement produces a significantly worse fit of the low - mass mass function .",
    "to summarize , the following are the steps to run a void simulation using our new approach : ( 1 ) select the present - epoch underdensity @xmath46 of the voids of interest .",
    "( 2 ) select the parameters of the background cosmology in which the voids reside .",
    "( 3 ) compute the effective cosmological parameters ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath63 ) of the interior of the void , following section [ sec : parameters ] ( this requires numerical integration of the friedmann equation of the void to compute the appropriate value of @xmath8 ) . ( 4 ) compute the modified initial power spectrum of fluctuations , following section [ sec : powerspec ] .",
    "( 5 ) run a simulation using these parameters and power spectrum , in a box with comoving size @xmath95 , such that the box size is not a large multiple of the void diameter .",
    "( 6 ) rescale the simulation results to adjust for the difference in comoving scales in the voids - only simulation and the background cosmology .    using only a few extra steps in preparing the simulation",
    ", we significantly improve the efficiency of our simulations . for fixed computational resources .",
    "we gain at least an order of magnitude in mass resolution : the voids of interest fill at least @xmath122 of the volume of the universe but have @xmath123 the mean density of galaxies , thus a voids - only simulation can use the same number of particles to simulate the formation of a factor of @xmath124 fewer galaxies at a fixed level of force refinement ( because we simulate only the void galaxies of interest ) .",
    "high - level adaptive simulations of larger regions will , at best , asymptotically approach the efficiency of the proposed method . simulating only the void region also affords a small increase in spatial resolution .",
    "this approach is in contrast to running a large simulation , then excising the underdense regions for closer inspection . in the latter ,",
    "huge computational resources are expended on regions which are uninteresting for the analysis of voids , i.e. , clusters , which soak up lots of computational cycles .",
    "this approach for running specialized void simulations is valid for studying the interior of large voids .",
    "we intentionally smooth out structure on the largest scales .",
    "thus , any contribution of tidal structure to the internal dynamics of voids can not be studied by the current approach . nor ,",
    "for that matter , can the large scale internal structure of voids be examined , as the edges are likely to be strongly affected by nearby structure .",
    "the next step in this analysis is to apply this approach to run large hydrodynamic simulations of void regions .",
    "we will use this technique to make projections of the mass spectrum of galaxies in voids ( goldberg et al . 2004 ) , as well as their photometric , morphological , and spectroscopic properties .",
    "these simulations will be used to interpret results from analysis of large samples of void galaxies being identified from the sloan digital sky survey ( rojas et al .",
