    "the earliest stages of star formation are characterized not only by mass accretion onto a circumstellar molecular disk and onto the forming protostar but also by massive bipolar molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "the outflows may be driven by narrowly collimated jets that are launched close to the young star , possibly in the innermost regions of the accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most promising jet formation theories relate to the magnetocentrifugal mechanism @xcite .",
    "the two key variants are distinguished by where the wind is launched : from close to where the disk is truncated by the stellar magnetosphere ( x - wind model , @xcite ) , or along open magnetic field lines streaming off the disk @xcite .",
    "high - resolution interferometric radio observations , being unaffected by the intervening molecular material , reveal compact , thermal jets very close to the protostars ( tens to a few hundred au , or up to a few arcseconds at the distance of young stars in taurus ; @xcite ) and coincident with the optical - jet bases .",
    "the common explanation invokes shock ionization where the stellar wind or the polar outflows collide with overlying denser or infalling material .    these inner jet regions can shock - heat plasma to x - ray temperatures for realistic flow velocities .",
    "the shock temperature is @xmath5  k where @xmath6 is the shock front speed relative to a target , in units of 100  km  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "jet speeds are typically of order @xmath8  km  s@xmath7 ( @xcite = em98 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and inner - jet velocities reach up to 7001000  km  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if a flow shocks a standing medium at 400  km  s@xmath7 , then @xmath9  mk .",
    "x - rays have been detected both from shock fronts in herbig - haro objects far from the driving star ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but also from regions as close as 100  au to the l1551 irs-5 protostar @xcite , while the central star is entirely absorbed by the molecular gas .    an obvious question to ask is whether jets are more active closer to the star",
    ". the consequences would be far - reaching : distributed , large - scale x - ray sources may efficiently ionize larger parts of the circumstellar environment than the central star alone , and in particular the disk surface , thus inducing disk accretion instabilities @xcite and altering the disk chemistry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "strong x - ray attenuation close to protostars prohibits verification .",
    "instead , we have studied a rare transition object , dg tau a , that still drives strong , protostar - like jets while being optically revealed .",
    "although considered to be a classical t tau star ( ctts ; distance @xmath10  pc , spectral type k5 , mass = 0.67@xmath11 , @xcite ) , dg tau a shows a rare , flat infrared spectral energy distribution and drives a very energetic jet similar to class i protostars , including a counter - jet ( lavalley - fouquet et al .",
    "2000 = l00 ) .",
    "dg tau is one of the most active ctts known @xcite , and can thus be thought of as a transition object between protostars and ctts @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified the jet at radio wavelengths and found indications of outflow motions .",
    "the stellar optical extinction is rather modest , with @xmath12 = 2.2 @xcite .",
    "this enables detection of soft x - rays down to the star , which is not possible in the case of embedded protostars . despite considerable efforts , no close companion to dg tau",
    "a has been identified @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution studies with adaptive optics , interferometry and the _ hubble space telescope _ have shown that a narrow jet ploughs through progressively slower and wider outflow structures , with maximum bulk gas speeds reaching 500  km  s@xmath7 @xcite and fwhm line widths of 100200  km  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the high - velocity jet shows bow - shock like structures out to several arcsecs ( `` hh 158 '' ) , e.g. , at 34   and at about 10   distance from the central star ( l00 ; @xcite ; em98 ) , but can be followed down to 0.1   from the star @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite measured rotation of the jet around its flow axis , which has subsequently been used to infer the origin of the jet in the inner disk ( 0.3@xmath134  au for the lower - velocity component , and possibly in the x - wind region at the inner - disk edge at @xmath14  au for the high - velocity jet ; @xcite ) .",
    "the jet mass - loss rate , @xmath15yr@xmath7 , is about one tenth of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "shocks seem to be the principal source of heating and excitation ( l00 ) .",
    "we have observed dg tau a with _",
    "chandra _ for 29.6  ks on 2003 july 2 .",
    "we used the acis - s detector in very faint mode .",
    "the data were reduced in ciao vers .",
    "3.0.2 following the standard analysis threads .",
    "these procedures included corrections for charge transfer inefficiency and afterglow , and selection of good time intervals .",
    "standard pixel randomization was applied but we found no significant effect on our imaging results . although the field of view contained a number of other sources ( dg tau b , fv tau ab , kpno - tau 13 ) , the present _ letter _ addresses only our findings on the ctts dg tau a.",
    "dg tau a was detected at @xmath16(2000 ) = 04@xmath17 , @xmath18(2000 ) = @xmath19 as determined with the wavelet source detection task in ciao .",
    "the position given in the 2mass catalog is @xmath16(2000 ) = 04@xmath20 , @xmath18(2000 ) = @xmath21 .",
    "the difference , @xmath22 , is not significant within the systematic uncertainty of the _ chandra _ position .",
    "we extracted counts from dg tau a from within 19 of the stellar position in the energy range of 0.37  kev ( this circular area contains @xmath2395% of the energy from a point source ) .",
    "we thus collected 391 counts , corresponding to an average count rate of @xmath24  ct  s@xmath7 .",
    "the dg tau a image shows some irregularities out to a distance of about 5  in the energy range of @xmath25  kev but not at lower or at higher energies .",
    "the region around dg tau a , further constrained to photon energies between @xmath26  kev to suppress background at lower and higher energies ( resulting in 191  cts around dg tau a ) , is shown in fig .",
    "we find an excess of counts along a position angle of about 45  and 225 , closely coincident with the position angle of the optical jet ( @xmath27 , em98 ) . a small accumulation of soft counts at a distance of @xmath28 southwest of dg tau a is coincident with a shock zone seen in optical lines after accounting for proper motion of the shock zone within the jet @xcite .",
    "the extensions are aligned neither with the ccd pixel rows nor the columns .",
    "we extracted counts from two circular regions of radius @xmath29 , adjacent to the source area ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "these latter areas combined include 18 counts in the 0.37  kev range , 17 of which are found in the interval 0.42.4  kev ( and one count at 4.6  kev , compared to 274  cts for dg tau a within 19 )",
    ". some of these counts may be due to the extended wings of the stellar psf . to estimate the expected contamination , we simulated the dg tau  a point source with the marx software , using precisely the same boresight coordinates and satellite position angle as in the real observation but collecting a total of @xmath30  cts in the stellar source across the spectrum to achieve good statistics .",
    "although dg tau a was located about 85   off - axis , the shape of the psf is almost precisely circular and not significantly broadened compared to the on - axis psf . using the same extraction regions used for dg tau a and its extensions , we found that only 0.46% or an average of 1.3 counts of the stellar 0.42.4  kev counts fall within the regions of the extensions .",
    "also , scaling the 0.42.4  kev background around dg tau a , we expect on average 0.7 background counts in the extensions .",
    "conservatively assuming 3  cts of contamination , we find an excess of 14  counts ( 0.42.4  kev ) in the extensions , corresponding to about 5@xmath31 with respect to the poisson fluctuation in the contamination .",
    "the dg tau a spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( upper series of crosses ) is peculiar .",
    "it shows a peak at @xmath32  kev , pointing at rather low temperatures , a trough at about 1.3  kev , a secondary peak around 1.8  kev and and an extended , shallow but bright tail up to at least 5  kev , suggesting high temperatures .",
    "we fitted thermal continuum+emission line models ( based on the apec model in xspec , @xcite ) together with a _",
    "single _ neutral - gas absorption column density , @xmath33 .",
    "abundances were either fitted as a global metallicity with respect to the solar photospheric composition , or they were fitted individually .",
    "no acceptable fit was found if two thermal components were assumed ( either one temperature diverged to unrealistically high values , or a strongly absorbed , cool component with an large 0.110  kev x - ray luminosity @xmath34}$ ] , @xmath35  egs  s@xmath7 , uncommon to t tau stars , was added , while the reduced @xmath36 ) .",
    "the spectrum is , however , excellently fitted by adopting _ different absorption column densities _ for the two thermal components ( @xmath37 for 30 degrees of freedom ) . here , we have fixed the global abundance at 0.3 times the solar photospheric value given by @xcite as is often found in active stars @xcite , but values as high as unity do not change these parameters significantly .",
    "we thus find a composite spectrum consisting of a cool component with @xmath38  mk ( 1@xmath31 errors ) and @xmath39  @xmath2 , and a hot component with @xmath40  mk and a much increased @xmath41  @xmath2 .",
    "the best - fitting model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( thin histogram ) .",
    "we plot the contribution from the strongly absorbed hard component separately ( thick histogram ) .",
    "the emission measure ratio em@xmath42/em@xmath43 is close to unity . for the soft and the hard components , @xmath34}$ ] is , respectively , @xmath44  erg  s@xmath7 and @xmath45  erg  s@xmath7 , totaling @xmath46  erg  s@xmath7 or @xmath47 ( using @xmath48 , @xcite ) .",
    "our composite spectrum requires two different sources that can not be co - spatial : we would not expect two sources at the same position to have different @xmath33 .",
    "a binary with components subject to different @xmath33 could produce such a spectrum but no such companion has been found , despite dedicated searches ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the soft source is unusual for its rather low temperature of 2.9  mk whereas the associated @xmath33 is compatible with the stellar optical extinction of 2.2  mag @xcite based on the usual conversion of @xmath49  @xmath2 .",
    "the extended emission shows a similar spectral energy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , gray crosses ) .",
    "the hard component with @xmath50  mk is typical for ctts in star - forming regions @xcite although it appears to be seen through a higher absorbing column than is the stellar photosphere .",
    "we make the following speculations .",
    "the extended , elongated features in the acis - s image , in particular at about 4@xmath51 sw ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , are soft x - rays formed in shocks in the inner regions of the jet .",
    "this corresponds to distances also reported by optical observers and is analogous to the finding reported for l1551 irs-5 @xcite .",
    "the soft , low - absorption peak of the two - component _ stellar _ x - ray spectrum is unlikely to originate close to the source of the more attenuated , presumably magnetospheric , hard x - ray emission .",
    "an origin of the soft component away from the absorbed hard x - ray region may suggest that the base of the jet ( within the _ chandra _ point - spread function of the star ) could be involved .",
    "we now estimate whether this hypothesis is plausible .",
    "the gas streaming along the jet can shock - heat if colliding with a slower medium downstream .",
    "a simple model for shock - heating has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the shock - jump conditions give for the shock temperature @xmath52 , @xmath53 while the predicted luminosity of the shock is the smaller of @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the pre - shock density , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the characteristic radius the bow - shock zone around its axis .",
    "these values underestimate the true x - ray luminosities @xmath58 and @xmath59 by factors of 13 because line emission has not been considered @xcite .",
    "we distinguish between conditions close to the star ( within the _ chandra _ acis point - spread function of dg tau a ) and in the inner optical jet , a few arcsecs away from the star .",
    "l00 estimate @xmath60  @xmath61 for the innermost jet at 0.22 , and @xmath62  @xmath61 at a distance of 3.5 .",
    "the shock - zone radius is of order 0.1   ( or smaller ) in the inner jet region @xcite , and about 1   at a distance of 34   ( l00 ) , corresponding to a linear radius of @xmath63  cm and @xmath64  cm , respectively , assuming dg tau a is 140  pc from us .",
    "assuming @xmath65  km  s@xmath7 , these parameters predict @xmath66  erg  s@xmath7 ( at both assumed distances ) ; and @xmath67  erg  s@xmath7 for the inner region and @xmath68  erg  s@xmath7 for the outer region .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) , we find @xmath69  mk .",
    "maximum velocities in the dg tau jet reach 450  km  s@xmath7 in the visible jet at @xmath70 @xcite , and up to 600  km  s@xmath7 close to the star @xcite . in these latter cases , @xmath71  mk and 5.4  mk , respectively .",
    "we have assumed shock velocities essentially equal to the jet velocities , which is acceptable if the dense jet travels into a low - density environment .",
    "also , we have assumed a jet ploughing into a standing medium .",
    "the above luminosities are much smaller for a shock velocity of @xmath72  km  s@xmath7 , corresponding to shocks between the fast jet and the moving adjacent medium ( l00 ) , and the low shock temperature will then produce most of the emission outside x - ray wavelengths .",
    "although we used only rough estimates for densities , velocities , and source sizes , the luminosities in the range of @xmath73  erg  s@xmath7 ( and higher if line emission is accounted for ) compare favorably with the total luminosity in the soft component of the stellar spectrum , @xmath74  erg  s@xmath7 .",
    "we have presented a first analysis of the x - ray properties of the peculiar ctts dg tau a. this star , classified as an optically revealed t tau star , drives a strong jet reminiscent of protostellar analogs .",
    "it also shows a flat infrared energy distribution , indicative of a massive circumstellar disk .",
    "dg tau a is thus one of the rare pre - main sequence stars whose jet emission can be followed essentially down to the star in the optical and the soft x - ray range .",
    "x - ray emission possibly produced in shocks at the base of the jet can therefore be detected given the low degree of photoelectric absorption by the intervening gas column .",
    "we speculate that the anomalous x - ray spectrum composed of two components with different absorption column densities is due to two sources , one probably being of magnetospheric or coronal origin and producing hard x - rays common to t tau stars , while the soft , little absorbed component could predominantly be produced further away in shocks close to the base of the jet .",
    "if this mechanism operates also in deeply embedded protostars , then the consequences would be far - reaching . instead of a central point source ,",
    "a linear column of x - ray sources may irradiate a large portion of the molecular environment , thus ionizing its gas and altering the cloud and disk chemistry .    before concluding , we mention two caveats .",
    "shock velocities are commonly smaller _ within _ optically observed jets , in the range of 70100  km  s@xmath7 in dg tau a ( l00 ) . similar to the case in l1551 irs-5 , however , our data lead us to postulate collision velocities in parts of the jet corresponding to the bulk jet velocity of several 100  km  s@xmath7 perhaps against the interstellar medium at rest , or against infalling material close to the star . and",
    "second , while the extended structure in the _ chandra _ image is suggestive of jet - shock - induced emission several arcsec away from the star , the statistics are still poor , and deeper observations are required to better confine the spectral parameters .    combining the evidence collected here , however , does suggest that the outstanding feature of dg tau a , its strong jet , is a contributor both to the anomalous x - ray spectrum and the faint extensions seen in the _ chandra _ image . a similar situation may thus apply to embedded protostars although x - ray attenuation makes verification very difficult .",
    "the excess photoabsorption of the hard radiation in dg tau a is unexplained .",
    "absorption could be due to disk gas if most of the magnetosphere is on the far side of the disk , or due to weakly ionized gas that streams along the magnetic field lines toward the star , or due to a highly flared inner disk .",
    "excess x - ray absorption in the absence of excess stellar extinction by dust may also arise from uncommon gas - to - dust ratios , e.g. , a lowered dust content along the line of sight toward the star due to dust evaporation in the stellar vicinity .",
    "alternatively , an undetected companion could also account for the different @xmath33 in the two sources , although the difference in the intrinsic x - ray spectra would be surprising .",
