    "[ sec : discuss ] , along with a comparison with other published measurements . in sect .",
    "[ sec : sum ] we give a short summary of our results .",
    "we used the 19-channel bolometer of the mpifr ( kreysa etal .",
    "1993 ) in the nasmyth focus of the iram 30-m telescope during the spring session in 1997 .",
    "the weather conditions were fair during our night - time runs , with rather stable zenith opacities between 0.2 and 0.3 at 230  ghz .    the 19 channels of the bolometer are arranged in a closely packed hexagonal array , with beamsizes of 11  fwhm and spacings of 20 .",
    "the calibration was performed by mapping uranus every morning .",
    "the pointing and focus checks were made at regular intervals during the observations using nearby quasars ( in particular 1308 + 326 ) .",
    "the map was centered on the near  infrared peak at @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( joy etal .",
    "the data were taken in the standard mapping mode where the field is scanned at a constant speed of 4  per second in azimuth , with subsequent scans being spaced by 4  in elevation .",
    "the map size was chosen large enough ( 320@xmath9 270 ) to assure a good baseline determination in the presence of extended emission .",
    "we thus made sure that the field was mapped sufficiently far out perpendicular to the major axis of m82 , such as to trace the full extent of any dust component in the halo .",
    "while scanning the subreflector was wobbled at a 2hz rate with an amplitude of 45 , which is small enough to ensure a stable beam pattern . due to the small wobbler",
    "throw the off position was not necessarily free of emission , but using the algorithm of emerson et al .",
    "( 1979 ) this should have no effect on the resulting map .",
    "we also mapped mars once and the point source 3c273 twice each in order to obtain a detailed beam pattern .",
    "in addition , more maps of mars and other calibration sources were used to properly check the calibration .",
    "the whole field was covered six times . for each coverage",
    "we performed the data reduction separately using nic ( gildas software package ) , starting with the subtraction of a third  order baseline .",
    "the scanning mode described in the previous section leads to maps which contain a superposition of a positive and a negative image of the source ( double - beam maps ) . in principle",
    "the deconvolution can be done by dividing the fourier transform ( ft ) of the measured intensity distribution by the ft of the wobble function and transforming back to image space . as the ft of the wobble function is a sine wave with zeroes at the origin and at harmonics of the inverse wobbler throw , problems at these spatial frequencies . to avoid these problems we used the algorithm of emerson etal .",
    "( 1979 ) to restore the double  beam maps into equivalent single  beam maps .",
    "thereafter we combined the 19 channels and calibrated the resulting map with respect to mars and uranus ( assuming brightness temperatures of 198.5  k and 97.2  k respectively ) . in a last step",
    "the four best coverages were averaged and regridded onto equatorial ( b1950 ) coordinates .",
    "( two coverages were ignored because of bad s / n ratios . )",
    "this final map has a sensitivity of 5  mjy per beam and a angular resolution of 12  ( hpbw ) .      in order to check the influence of the error beam on the extended emission we applied a clean algorithm developed for single  dish maps ( klein mack 1995 ) to each coverage using a radially symmetric antenna pattern .",
    "this pattern was obtained in the following way : a field of 45 @xmath9 35 size was mapped centred on 3c273 .",
    "this antenna pattern was then rotated in small steps ( @xmath10 ) , and these individual ( rotated ) maps were averaged to yield a nearly radially symmetric pattern .",
    "the subtraction of the cleaned map from the original one showed that the error beam contributes less than 25% of the rms noise level to the extended emission ( @xmath11  away from the central position ) .",
    "even the sidelobes can be ignored in our case , because at @xmath0 1.2 mm they are of the order of 2% , corresponding to roughly 5mjy / beam in the m82 maps . averaging four coverages with different parallactic angles ( and accordingly different positions of the sidelobes ) the effect of the antenna pattern on",
    "the extended emission falls well below the rms noise of our final map .",
    "this extra analysis make sure that the extended emission seen in our map is real and not affected by the error beam .      using the 19-channel bolometer , with its central frequency of 240  ghz and its effective bandwidth of @xmath12  80  ghz , the @xmath1co(2@xmath21 )  line at 230  ghz",
    "might noticeably contribute to the total intensity in the bandpass . to get a reliable information on the distribution of the cold dust ,",
    "we applied the following correction to our continuum map :    we used a @xmath13 map of m82 made with the same telescope in the @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) line ( obtained to provide the zero spacings for an investigation with the plateau de bure interferometer , wei etal.in prep . ) .",
    "this map was measured in the on  the  fly mode .",
    "the on  the  fly technique ensures a uniform sampling of the emission over the whole field with good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "since we knew from our continuum map that the effects of the error beam can be neglected at a frequency of 240  ghz , we did not apply any error beam correction to the co map .",
    "integrating over the effective bandwidth of the bolometer , the total continuum flux in the beam at the peak position is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15  mjy is the peak flux at 240  ghz .",
    "the integrated intensity of the @xmath1co(2@xmath21 ) line at the same position @xmath16 was taken from our co map . expressing this in terms of frequency instead of velocity",
    ", the integrated intensity reads    to obtain the total flux in the @xmath1co(2@xmath21 ) line we used the rayleigh ",
    "jeans approximation and assumed that t@xmath17 : @xmath18 with the beam solid angle @xmath19sr and the integrated @xmath1co(2@xmath21 ) intensity from above we get thus , @xmath20 at the position of the continuum peak .",
    "if we assume that this value holds for the whole galaxy , which of course is a simplification , we can obtain a co  corrected continuum map by subtracting the appropriately scaled co map from our continuum map .",
    "the uncorrected and the corrected map are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mitohne ] .",
    "[ fig : cont ] shows the co - corrected continuum map of m82 at @xmath01.2 mm , superimposed onto an optical image . at @xmath01.2 mm m82",
    "has a more or less oval shape ( ellipticity e  @xmath21  0.6 ) , with the major axis parallel to the galactic plane ( molecular gas ) .",
    "this corresponds to a position angle of approximately 70 .",
    "the maximum of the continuum emission is located at @xmath22 , @xmath235455 . within the errors",
    "this position is identical to the peaks of the distributions at @xmath0800@xmath24 m and @xmath01.1 mm ( hughes etal .",
    "1990 ) . besides this regular shape",
    "there are some spur  like features extending above and below the galactic plane , which might be associated with the outflow seen at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] indicate some extended emission also along the minor axis of the galaxy , but at first glance the extent in this direction is not as large as suggested by the maps of kuno matsuo ( 1997 ) and alton etal .",
    "we have therefore computed the intensity as a function of distance from the galactic center along the minor ( major ) axis , averaging over some 30  in the major - axis ( minor - axis ) direction .",
    "these profiles are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : slice ] . for comparison the @xmath1co(2@xmath21 ) line intensity , the 850  @xmath24 m ( alton etal .",
    "1999 ) and 20  cm continuum profiles are shown , too .",
    "the @xmath01.2  mm emission shows the most concentrated distribution , significantly smaller than that at 850  @xmath24 m .",
    "especially the scale height along the minor axis is very small with respect to the other wavelengths and the molecular emission .",
    "contrary to the expectation the molecular emission is the most extended component .",
    "possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed in sect .",

    ".flux densities of m82 from radio through ir wavelengths . [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     integrating over the continuum map we obtain a total flux density of s@xmath25  jy .",
    "this is lower than the value measured by krgel et al .",
    "( 1990a ) , but their flux density was much more uncertain , owing to the lower sensitivity of their 1-channel bolometer .",
    "our new 240  ghz measurement is completely consistent with the slope of the spectrum at this frequency ( indicated by the dotted line ) , whereas the value derived by kuno  &  matsuo ( 1997 ) at 157  ghz lies much too high with respect to all adjacent data points .",
    "the co  corrected flux density is significantly lower than the flux density in our original map .",
    "this demonstrates that a line correction for continuum measurements in the relevant bands is indispensible .",
    "the total flux can be turned into a gas mass via @xmath26 with a distance of d = 3.25  mpc , and using the same parameters as krgel etal .",
    "( 1990a ) , i.e. a dust temperature of t@xmath27 = 30  k ( chini etal .",
    "1989 ) and a , we derive a gas mass of if we adopted the draine & lee value @xmath28 ( draine & lee 1984 ) the resulting gas mass would be somewhat lower ( @xmath29 ) .    in this calculation",
    "we assumed a gas - to - dust ratio of approximately m@xmath30/m@xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding dust mass is",
    "the @xmath02 mm map ( kuno & matsuo 1997 ) shows continuum emission with a box  like shape , indicating a dust halo around m82 .",
    "although the emission at @xmath01.2 mm and @xmath02 mm should be similar , we do not see any /*-evidence for a significant halo contribution to the cold dust .",
    "this difference could be due to the error beam of the nobeyama 45-m telescope .",
    "effects of the error beam and the antenna pattern have been investigated and largely removed from our map ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : obse : errorbeam ] ) , while this is not mentioned in case of the nobeyama measurements .",
    "the total flux density in the nobeyama map is 1.7jy , which is much more than expected at this wavelength ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spektrum ] .",
    "this extra flux might be due to emission entering through sidelobes and the error beam .",
    "the 850@xmath24 m map made by alton etal .",
    "( 1999 ) with the jcmt shows continuum emission at the 50mjy level up to 40  above the galactic plane .",
    "this translates to 15mjy at @xmath01.2 mm , corresponding to the second contour ( 3@xmath32 ) in our map .",
    "considering only the overall extent of the emission , the jcmt map is consistent with ours .",
    "the different shapes might be due to problems with the baseline subtraction , because the area mapped by alton etal .",
    "is only slightly larger than the extent of the continuum emission .      in non  active galaxies like ngc4565 ( neininger etal .",
    "1996 ) and ngc5907 ( dumke etal .",
    "1997 ) the molecular line emission is more concentrated towards the central region than the thermal dust emission . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : slice ] and  [ fig : vergleich ] the galaxy m82 exhibits the opposite behaviour . the co emission appears to be much more extended than the continuum . since the maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : vergleich ] are made with the same telescope at the same frequency , the difference can not be due to different beam patterns and error beams .",
    "the molecular gas can be excited by the radiation field , but also by low ",
    "energy cosmic rays and by soft x  ray photons ( see e.g. glassgold langer 1973 ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : slice ] shows that the synchrotron intensity at @xmath020  cm drops faster with distance from the galaxy plane than the co and even the dust emission .",
    "however , at low radio frequencies there may be a significant radio halo ( low  energy cosmic rays have longer lifetimes ) , which is already indicated by the 327mhz map of reuter etal .",
    "hence , there may be abundant cosmic rays for heating .",
    "such cosmic rays ( e @xmath33100  mev ) remain , however , invisible in the radio window , since even in the strong ( @xmath34 g ) magnetic field of m82 they produce synchrotron radiation at frequencies below about 10  mhz .",
    "rays are also seen far out of the plane of m82 ( e.g. bregman etal .",
    "these circumstances provide the likely heating sources for any molecular material transported out of the disk of m82 into the halo , rendering the co  overluminous  .",
    "this is also indicated by the low conversion ratio of co line intensity to molecular gas column density , x@xmath35 derived by smith etal .",
    "the existence of a soft x  ray and a low  frequency radio halo around m82 readily explains the larger extent of the co emission as compared to the cold dust .",
    "in this paper we presented a new high  sensitivity map of the continuum emission at @xmath01.2 mm in the starburst galaxy m82 . to get a reliable map of the extended thermal dust emission we applied a clean algorithm to our map ( error beam correction ) and subsequently subtracted the @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) line emission . besides this the contribution of the sidelobes of the iram 30-m telescope has been estimated .",
    "although the continuum emission is not confined to the galactic disk , our map rules out the existence of any pronounced halo of cold dust around m82 .",
    "we find the co(2@xmath21 ) line emission to be clearly more extended than the @xmath01.2 mm dust emission .",
    "this unexpected observational result now waits for a conclusive theoretical explanation .",
