    "in massive mimo systems a base station ( bs ) with a large number of antennas ( @xmath9 , a few hundreds ) communicates with several user terminals ( @xmath10 , a few tens ) on the same time - frequency resource @xcite . there has been recent interest in massive mimo systems due to their ability to increase spectral and energy efficiency even with very low - complexity multi - user detection and precoding @xcite .",
    "however , physically building cost - effective and energy - efficient large arrays is a challenge . specifically in the downlink , the power amplifiers ( pas ) used in the bs",
    "should be highly power - efficient .",
    "due to the trade - off between the efficiency and linearity of the pa @xcite , highly efficient but non - linear pas must be used .",
    "the efficiency of the pa is related to the amount of backoff necessitated ( to reduce non - linear distortion ) by the peak to average ratio of the input waveform . for minimum backoff and hence maximum efficiency",
    ", the input waveform should have a constant or nearly _ constant envelope _ ( ce).[multiblock footnote omitted ]    with this motivation , in @xcite",
    "we had proposed a ce precoding algorithm for the frequency - flat multi - user mimo broadcast channel , which was then extended to frequency - selective channels in @xcite . with @xmath9",
    "sufficiently larger than @xmath10 and i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading , numerical studies done in both these papers revealed that in order to achieve a desired per - user ergodic information rate , the proposed ce precoding algorithm needed only about @xmath11 db extra total transmit power compared to that required under the less stringent and commonly used total average transmit power constraint .",
    "it was also observed that even under a stringent per - antenna ce constraint , an @xmath12 array gain is achievable , i.e. , with every doubling in the number of bs antennas the total transmit power can be reduced by @xmath13 db while maintaining a fixed information rate to each user ( assuming that the number of users is fixed ) .    however , in the ce precoding algorithm proposed in @xcite the phase angle of the complex baseband signal transmitted from each bs antenna is unconstrained ( i.e. , it s principal value lies in @xmath14 $ ] ) , and therefore it is possible that the phase could vary very fast between consecutive channel uses .",
    "a phase variation of @xmath15 ( or more ) between consecutive channel uses will result in zero crossings in the baseband signal , which with practical pas could lead to distortion in the transmitted signal . in this paper , we address this problem by proposing a ce precoding algorithm with an additional constraint that the difference of the phase angle transmitted in consecutive channel uses be limited to the interval @xmath0 $ ] for a fixed @xmath1 ( the special case of @xmath16 was considered in @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown that the complexity of the proposed ce algorithm is independent of @xmath3 and is the same as the algorithm proposed in @xcite .",
    "numerical studies on the i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading channel suggest that an @xmath12 array gain is achieved even under the additional phase angle variation constraint . to achieve a desired per - user information rate , the extra total transmit power required under the time variation constraint when compared to the special case of no time variation constraint (",
    "i.e. , @xmath2 ) , is _ small _ when @xmath3 is close to @xmath6 and @xmath17 .",
    "for example , with @xmath8 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 single - antenna users and a desired per - user rate of @xmath6 bit - per - channel - use ( bpcu ) , the magnitude of the phase variation is limited to @xmath20 and the extra transmit power required is less than @xmath21 db .",

    "note that for the ce precoding method , the transmit phase angles can take any value in the interval @xmath46 ( see ( [ nls_joint_eqn ] ) ) .",
    "therefore it is possible that between consecutive time instances , the phase angle transmitted from a bs antenna could change by a large magnitude , which will distort the transmit signal at the output of the pa . to address this issue ,",
