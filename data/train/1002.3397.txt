    "recently , large thermopower has been experimentally observed in quasi - two - dimensional organic conductors having @xmath0-type alignment of the donor molecules , e. g. @xmath0-(edo-_s , s_-dmedt - ttf)@xmath1(aubr@xmath1)@xmath2 ( @xmath3)@xcite . the absolute value of the seebeck coefficient takes its maximum of about @xmath4 @xmath5v / k around the temperature of @xmath6 k to @xmath7 k.    a possible link between the large thermopower and the electronic structure is of special interest .",
    "in fact , a calculated band structure for @xmath0-(edo-_s , s_-dmedt - ttf)@xmath1(aubr@xmath1)@xmath2 using the extended h@xmath8ckel method @xcite has shown presence of a star - shaped fermi surface and a peculiar band structure with flat portions near the @xmath9 point .",
    "another feature of this material is the variation of the band - filling corresponding to the amount of anions .",
    "the anion content of @xmath10 corresponds to the electron band filling of @xmath11 .    in the present study",
    ", we perform an _ ab initio _ band calculation for @xmath0-(edo-_s , s_-dmedt - ttf)@xmath1aubr@xmath1 using the wien2k package,@xcite and make a tight binding model fit to the obtained _ ab initio _ band structure .",
    "we calculate the seebeck coefficient using the boltzmann s equation approach and show that the peculiar band structure is the origin of the large seebeck coefficient .",
    "we have performed calculations using all - electron full potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw ) + local orbitals ( lo ) method to solve the kohn - sham equations using density functional theory ( dft ) within the framework of wien2k @xcite .",
    "this implements the dft with different possible approximation for the exchange correlation potentials .",
    "the exchange correlation potential is calculated using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the single - particle wave functions in the interstitial region are expanded by plane waves with a cutoff of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the smallest muffin tin radius and @xmath14 is the maximum value of the @xmath15 vector in the plane wave expansion . in @xmath0-(edo-_s , s_-dmedt - ttf)@xmath1aubr@xmath1 ,",
    "the muffin - tin radii are assumed to be 2.38 , 2.11 , 1.61 , 1.27 , 1.18 and 0.64 atomic units ( au ) for au , br , s , o , c and h , respectively .",
    "for the value of @xmath14 and the plane wave cutoff energy , @xmath16 and the plane wave cutoff energy is 298.8 ev for @xmath0-(edo-_s , s_-dmedt - ttf)@xmath1aubr@xmath1 .",
    "the wave functions in the muffin tin spheres are expanded up to @xmath17 , while the charge density are fourier expanded up to @xmath18 .",
    "calculations are performed by using 512 @xmath19-points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the calculated band structure is shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "we have made a tight binding model fit to the _ ab initio _ band as shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) , where the transfer energies are determined as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 [ mev ] . as seen in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) , there are two band dispersions near the fermi level , separated by a band gap .",
    "the band width is estimated to be 1.28 ev , and the maximum value of the band gap is around 0.13 ev .",
    "using the boltzmann s equation approach , the thermopower is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the electron charge , @xmath27 is the temperature , tensors @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the band dispersion , @xmath32 is the group velocity , @xmath33 is the quasiparticle lifetime , @xmath34 is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath5 is the chemical potential .",
    "hereafter , we simply refer to @xmath35 as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ( for diagonal @xmath38 ) as @xmath39 . using @xmath40 ,",
    "conductivity can be given as @xmath41 . roughly speaking for a constant @xmath0 , @xmath42 ( apart from a constant factor ) stand , where @xmath43 is a summation over the states in the range of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are typical velocities for the states above and below @xmath5 , respectively . in usual metals ,",
    "where @xmath47 , the positive and negative contributions in @xmath48 nearly cancel out to result in a small @xmath39 .",
    "now , let us consider a band that has a somewhat flat portion at the top ( or the bottom ) , which sharply bends into a highly dispersive portion below ( above ) .",
    "we will refer to this band structure as the `` pudding mold '' type @xcite . for this type of band with @xmath5 sitting near the bending point",
    ", @xmath49 holds for high enough temperature , so that the cancellation in @xmath48 is less effective , resulting in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and thus large @xmath52v / k . an important point for this type of band",
    "is that the large @xmath45 and the large fermi surface result not only in large @xmath53 but also in large @xmath54 as well , being able to give a large power factor @xmath55 .",
    "the pudding mold type band scenario well explains the coexistence of large thermopower and metallic conductivity observed in na@xmath56coo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "now , if we look at the band structure of the @xmath0-type conductor from this viewpoint , the lower band has a nearly flat portion at the top , while the upper band has a nearly flat portion at the bottom .",
    "therefore , the band structure can be considered as `` inverted pudding mold type band '' on top of a `` pudding mold type band '' .",
    "using the boltzmann s equation approach and assuming a rigid band , we have calculated the temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient for the band filling @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which corresponds to the anion content of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "fig.1 ( a ) the band structure for the _ ab initio _ result ( red solid lines ) and the tight binding fit ( blue dashed curves ) .",
    "( b ) the tight binding model in this study .",
    "[ fig1 ]        fig.2 the calculated seebeck coefficient as functions of the temperature for the band filling of @xmath57 ( solid red ) and @xmath61 ( dashed green ) , corresponding to @xmath59 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "[ fig2 ]    although the maximum absolute value of the calculated @xmath39 is somewhat smaller than the experimental one @xcite , the overall tendency of the temperature dependence is well reproduced by the calculation when we adopt @xmath59 .",
    "the reason for the appearance of the maximum value of @xmath39 can be understood as follows . in the low temperature regime , due to the presence of the band gap ,",
    "only the upper band is effective , which gives a negative seebeck coefficient .",
    "the seebeck coefficient in this temperature regime can be large ( despite the metallic conductivitiy ) because of the inverted pudding mold shape of the upper band . at higher temperatures , the lower band , which gives",
    "a positive contribution to @xmath39 , becomes effective , and this suppresses the absolute value , resulting in a maximum value at a certain temperature .",
    "we have studied the origin of the large thermopower in the @xmath0-type organic conductor .",
    "we have performed an _ ab initio _ band calculation by using wien2k , and made a tight binding model fit to the _ ab initio _ band . using this tight binding model , we have calculated the seebeck coefficient which nicely reproduces the experimental results .",
    "we conclude that the peculiar band structure consisting of pudding + inverted pudding pudding mold type bands is the origin of the large thermopower as well as the appearance of the maximum value at a certain temperature .",
    "a more detailed analysis ( such as on the molecule dependence ) is now underway@xcite .",
