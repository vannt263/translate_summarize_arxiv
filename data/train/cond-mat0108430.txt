    "the quantum - dot field is recently focussing much attention on the analysis of symmetry unrestricted nanostructures , both from the experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "an important issue is the influence of the dot geometry on the edge modes that manifest in the far - infrared absorption .",
    "it is well known that parabolically confined dots can only absorb energy at the frequencies of the confining parabolas ( generalized kohn s theorem @xcite ) . however , either departures from a pure radial quadratic law or the introduction of an additional angular dependence in the confining potential may cause the fragmentation of the kohn modes and the emergence of a more complicated pattern .    at first",
    ", the great majority of theoretical approaches to quantum - dot absorption were restricted to the circular symmetry case , solving the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) equations by fully exploiting the analytical angular dependence of the single - particle orbitals @xcite .",
    "although very successful , this scheme is not easily applicable to symmetry - unrestricted nanostructures and different approaches have been proposed . in ref .",
    "@xcite magnsdttir and gudmundsson address the problem within the hartree theory by solving the resulting rpa matrices in the single - particle basis of the circular problem .",
    "the enormous matrix dimensions make the calculation feasible only for a rather small electron number .",
    "alternatively , ullrich and vignale @xcite have used a perturbative method to describe the absorption of elliptic dots .",
    "a different approach was used by two of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , consisting in the time simulation of the mean field density oscillations that follow an appropriate initial perturbation and from which one may extract the oscillation frequencies .",
    "this _ real time _",
    "calculations do not rely on any symmetry restriction having also been used to analyze excitations in deformed atomic nuclei and metal clusters @xcite .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on the description of the absorption in triangular and square shaped quantum dots using the time - dependent local - spin - density approximation ( tdlsda ) .",
    "the extension to low magnetic fields within this theory is considered as in ref .",
    "we show that the deformation leads to a departure from the kohn modes which is peculiar to the shape . at low magnetic fields",
    "the spectra possess a rich structure being possible to identify the presence of peak _ anticrossings _ associated with the deviation from circular shape , similar to those found experimentally by demel et al . @xcite . to further clarify the origin of the fragmentation , an analysis of the _ local _ absorption at different points of the nanostructure is given .",
    "this allows to associate each excitation with a particular absorption pattern , thus giving a more physical interpretation of the peaks .",
    "in particular , a distinction between _ corner _ and _ side _ modes can be established in this way .",
    "the magnetic field is shown to introduce an _ angular average _ of the patterns leading , for increasing intensity , to sizeable shape modifications of the absorption distribution .",
    "section ii of the paper is devoted to the characterization of the ground state for the square and triangular quantum dots . in sec .",
    "iii we address the description of the far infrared absorption presenting in different subsections the formalism and global spectrum ( iii.a ) , the local absorption ( iii.b ) and the angular average and magnetic evolution of the absorption patterns ( iii.c ) .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we focus our attention on semiconductor nanostructures of similar sizes and different polygonal shapes , in order to discuss the differences introduced by the geometry .",
    "it is assumed that the electron positions are restricted to the @xmath0 plane where , in addition , an external potential is confining them to an electronic island .",
    "different shapes are obtained by using the following potential , proposed by magnsdttir and gudmundsson @xcite , @xmath1 where we have used planar polar coordinates @xmath2 and the standard effective - atomic - unit system @xcite .",
    "the potential parameter @xmath3 gives the parabola curvature while @xmath4 and @xmath5 determine the deviation from circular symmetry . in this work we shall restrict to triangular and square shapes",
    "these are the two simplest geometries that deviate from a pure parabolic behaviour and whose absorption is therefore not fixed by the generalized kohn s theorem .",
    "a common parabola frequency @xmath6 a.u .  has been chosen both for the triangle and square while the deformation parameters have been fixed to @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , in order to obtain a proper triangle and box shape , as can be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "we have described the electronic structure within density - functional theory in the lsda .",
    "this approach has been used to address a variety of nonuniform electronic systems  such as atoms , molecules and clusters  and quantum dots are not an exception for many authors have used this scheme to analyze dot properties @xcite . obviously , for our present purposes a symmetry unrestricted solver is required .",
    "this can be obtained with different techniques @xcite such as diagonalization in a plane - wave basis or perturbative treatements based on a circular solution .",
    "we have resorted to the method developed by two of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the uniform discretization of the @xmath0 plane and the associated transformation of the diferential kohn - sham equations to be solved with iterative techniques .",
    "this method has also been applied by us to the study of quantum rings @xcite and dot molecules @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we have restricted the present study to nanostructures containing an intermediate number of electrons ( @xmath9 ) for which lsda is expected to provide a reasonable description of electron - electron interactions .",
    "figure 1 shows that the electronic distribution closely follows the shape of the external potential , clearly of triangular or square form . however , there are also conspicuous density peaks localized either at the corners or the interior of the structure .",
    "they are of course attributed to the formation of delocalized electronic orbitals , and to quantum effects associated with the presence of boundaries in the potential , similar to the well - known friedel oscillations at a metal surface .",
    "the description of excitations in deformed nanostructures constitutes a highly nontrivial task because of the lack of symmetry which does not allow the analytic integration of angular variables as in circular systems . in the present work we have used the tdlsda to obtain the time evolution , following an initial perturbation , of relevant expectation values .",
    "the single - particle orbitals @xmath10 evolve in time as @xmath11\\ , \\varphi_{i\\eta}({\\bf r},t)\\ ; , \\label{eqh}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the spin index , and total density and magnetization are given in terms of the spin densities @xmath13 , by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 in equation ( [ eqh ] ) contains , besides of kinetic energy , the confining and @xmath17 , hartree @xmath18 exchange - correlation @xmath19 potentials . the exchange - correlation energy density @xmath20 has been described as in refs .",
    "the zeeman energy @xmath21 @xcite is also included in eq .  [ eqh ] .",
    "an initial perturbation of the ground state orbitals @xmath22 models the interaction with the external field . for dipole excitations , corresponding to fir absorption in nanostructures , the unitary operator @xmath23 is represented by a rigid translation in an arbitrary direction @xmath24 , specifically @xmath25 } \\ ; , \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] where the @xmath26 parameter has been taken small enough in order to keep the system response in the linear regime .",
    "after the initial excitation we keep track of @xmath27 from where a frequency analysis provides the absorption energies and their associated intensities @xcite , characterized by the strength function @xmath28 , @xmath29 usually , one is interested in an average over different oscillation directions , corresponding to the absorption of nonpolarized radiation .",
    "this implies to average eq .",
    "( 4 ) over all @xmath24 directions . taking into account",
    "that in the small amplitude limit the strength in a particular direction only depends on the initial amplitude given in that direction the averaged strength may be obtained as @xcite @xmath30 it can easily be shown that for geometries with two or more equivalent symmetry axes @xmath28 actually does not depend on @xmath31 and therefore it coincides with @xmath32 .",
    "figure 2 displays the averaged spectrum obtained at @xmath33 for the square and triangle .",
    "notice that both cases show a two peak spectrum within lsda , although the interpeak separation is much higher for the triangle than for the square .",
    "this can be attributed to the higher level separation in the triangle .",
    "in fact , in the triangular case the single - particle levels exhibit a shell - like structure with gaps between groups of close levels , while for the square level straggling is somewhat higher .",
    "this reflects in the distribution of particle - hole transitions also shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the evolution of the absorption spectra with the intensity of the static magnetic field is shown in fig .  3 .",
    "in general , the magnetic field induces a splitting of the @xmath33 peaks , as is well known for the circular parabola @xcite where the two frequencies are @xmath34 . for the square and triangular dots",
    "the situation is more involved , since the @xmath35-induced splitting goes along with geometry effects .",
    "figure 3 indicates that there is a repulsion amongst the branches that originate from the @xmath33 modes , showing a zone of avoided crossings or _",
    "anticrossings _ of the collective peaks .",
    "these anticrossing areas are very sensitive to the geometry , showing complicated patterns with more than just two peaks .",
    "indeed , for the square it roughly covers the interval @xmath36 t while for the triangle this region is more extended lying between @xmath37 t. a similar difference is found when comparing the magnetic field @xmath38 at which the ground state spin polarizes from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the square first transition lies at @xmath41  t while for the triangle it is @xmath42  t. we also notice that the minimum energy gap between the two main branches is much smaller for the square than for the triangle .      to further analyze the origin of the fragmented absorption in squares and triangles we have computed the _",
    "local _ absorption in a way similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of excitonic states in semiconductors .",
    "this technique allows us to study the global absorption spectrum taking into account the different contributions from each spatial point , depending on how the electronic density is oscillating in time in the vicinity of that point . in practice",
    ", we simulate this position - dependent probe by introducing a local weighting function ( a narrow gaussian centered on each point ) and look for the oscillation frequencies of the convoluted density as a function of the probe position . after an initial dipole perturbation",
    "each local signal will evolve differently in time , thus manifesting the differences in absorption on a local scale .",
    "figure 4 shows the local absorption for the two modes at @xmath33 of the square and triangle when the system is excited along the @xmath43-axis ( @xmath44 ) . as a reference",
    "we also show the circular parabolic case , namely , @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the density in a circular parabola oscillates rigidly at the parabola frequency ( kohn s theorem ) and from fig .  4 we notice that the absorption indeed localizes on the edges along the oscillation direction ( @xmath43-axis ) , as was to be expected .",
    "turning now to the square geometry we notice that the dominanting mode at @xmath46 , very close to the parabola frequency @xmath6 , spatially localizes along the edges in the polarization direction in a way quite similar to the circular case . on the contrary ,",
    "the lower square mode at @xmath47 very clearly deviates from this situation showing four maxima at the corners of the nanostructure .",
    "this result suggests a classification of the two excitations as _ side _ and _ corner _",
    "modes , respectively .",
    "this classification is confirmed in the case of the triangle , where we see that the @xmath48 mode basically absorbs on one of the triangle sides while the @xmath49 absorbs on the opposite corner .",
    "the distinction between side and corner modes will be further commented in the next subsection where we shall present the angular average of the absorption patterns .    a remarkable property seen in fig .",
    "4 regards the spatial self - organization of the absorption modes .",
    "indeed , we realize that both in the square and the triangle the absorption maxima for a given mode lie at regions where the absorption for the other mode is strongly quenched .",
    "we may interpret this as a _ mode competition _ for an efficient distribution over the available nanostructure surface .",
    "the magnetic field introduces a coriolis - like force that makes the oscillation axis rotate in time . as a consequence ,",
    "the initial chosen direction becomes unimportant since the magnetic field will automatically change it in time .",
    "we can take advantage of this effect to obtain the averaged absorption patterns of fig .  4 over polarization directions by switching on a very small magnetic field .",
    "figure 5 shows the angularly averaged patterns corresponding to the same modes displayed in fig .",
    "the distinction between corner and side modes is very clear in the case of the triangle : for @xmath49 the mode is of corner type and for @xmath48 it is of side character . for the square",
    "this distinction is not as clear because the corners always absorb more than the side centers .",
    "nevertheles , the corner character is somehow higher for the low energy mode @xmath47 than for the high @xmath46 one ; in fact the former shows vanishing absorption at the side centers while the latter has a much smoother angular dependence .    when the magnetic field is increased additional fragmentation , with a complicated distribution of the absorption , appear both in the square and the triangle ( cf .",
    "because of the very large number of possible cases , we shall only select the more illustrative examples in the anticrossing areas .",
    "our aim is to discern the absorption pattern evolution with applied magnetic field and in particular , to check whether there is a relation between the energy repulsion of modes and their spatial localization .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the evolution with @xmath35 of the pattern for the two branches with the higher absorption , that repel each other , in the square and triangular dot , respectively .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "6 that indeed for the square a clear localization takes place at @xmath50  t ( the center of the anticrossing region ) at the corners for low energy branch and at the sides for the high energy one . in the triangle ,",
    "a more conspicuous side and corner character of the branches is retained for all magnetic fields due , as discussed above , to the existence of a greater energy gap between the different modes .",
    "figure 7 shows the patterns for @xmath51  t as well as the corresponding energy in the spectral range .",
    "the three lower patterns give rise , when added according to their relative strength , to the global strength distribution displayed in the rightmost panel which exhibits a clear corner identity .",
    "conversely , the upper branch possess a markedly side character .",
    "the same same trends have been obtained in the full range of magnetic fields corresponding to fig .  3 for the triangle .",
    "the fir absorption of a quantum dot with a triangular or square shape has been analyzed taking into account the effect of an applied static magnetic field , by means of real - time simulations in a spatial mesh within the lsda formalism .",
    "the fragmentation of the absorption due to the noncircular shape has been emphasized . in particular ,",
    "the existence of a rich absorption distribution for intermediate magnetic fields , associated with the repulsion between modes in the so - called anticrossing energy interval has been analyzed .",
    "the absorption pattern corresponding to the several excitation modes , for a given magnetic field , has been obtained from the local density oscillations .",
    "these patterns allow us to easily interpret the physical character of each mode .",
    "in particular , we have identified the existence of corner and side modes in the nanostructure . in the anticrossing intervals",
    "the absorption patterns of different modes do not significantly overlap , a result that we atribute to a mode competition for the available dot surface as well as a mode spatial repulsion , consistent with the energy repulsion leading to the anticrossing effect ."
