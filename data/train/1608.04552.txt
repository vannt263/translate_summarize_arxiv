    "the phenomenon of the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) based on the creation of a coherent superposition of long - living quantum states in a medium irradiated by a two laser light fields has been known since a long ago , see , e.g. , the review @xcite . the eit has become especially interesting and promissing for the quantum memory applications @xcite since the discovery of the method to  stop the light \" by conversion of photons of the weak ( signal ) into spin excitations of a medium by adiabatic turning off the second ( control ) field @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations followed the publication of the idea @xcite immediately and employed as the eit medium ultracold atoms @xcite , hot atomic vapor in a cell @xcite , and doped crystal @xcite .",
    "tripod scheme of atomic levels .",
    "[ au-1 ]    the @xmath0-scheme containing three quantum levels coupled to a laser radiation is a simplest one that admits coherent population trapping and the light propagation in a medium in the eit regime . the tripod scheme that contains three low - energy , stable ( or metastable ) sublevels supports two different quantum superpositions that are decoupled from coherent three - component laser radiation resonant to the optically excited state .",
    "various aspects of the slow - light propagation and storage in a tripod medium have been theoretically studied @xcite .",
    "there are numerous experimental studies of the eit in media with the tripod level scheme @xcite , culminating in the demonstration of the storage and retrieval of light pulses at a single - photon level @xcite .    the dynamical coupling between dark - state polaritons of the two types due to the time dependence of the control fields has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite but not properly studied .",
    "indeed , the hong - ou - mandel interferometer operation in a tripod medium @xcite requires the change of the control field parameters during the time interval of no signal photon coming . in our paper",
    "we consider the situation of signal photons interacting with a tripod medium where the coupling between the two types of dark - state polaritons is present .",
    "the signal laser pulse can be fully converted into spin excitations only if the medium is long enough to accommodate the whole slowed - down incoming pulse ( spatially compressed in proportion to the ratio of its group velocity in the eit regime and in the vacuum ) @xcite .",
    "we show that the existence of the two coupled dark - state polariton modes in a tripod medium allows for a conversion of almost the whole incoming light pulse into spin excitations in a case where a @xmath0-type medium irradiated by the control field of a comparable strength and , hence , being characterized by a comparably slow group velocity would simultaneously accomodates only a small part of the pulse .",
    "we consider a medium consisting of atoms with the level scheme shown in fig .  [ au-1 ] .",
    "the ground - state sublevels @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are coupled to an excited state @xmath4 by three coherent fields .",
    "the control fields driving the transitions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are characterized by rabi frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "these fields are phase - locked or obtained from a common source by acousto - optical modulator in order to provide perfect cross - correlation of their noise and to prevent thus a noise - induced decay of the quantum coherence between the states @xmath2 and @xmath9 @xcite . the transition @xmath10 is driven by a quantized signal field .",
    "we can consider a field propagating freely through the atomic sample @xcite or in a nanofiber @xcite ; the propagation direction of the signal field defines the axis @xmath11 .",

    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume the amplitudes of the two control fields to be constant , but instead we introduce the detuning of the second field @xmath16 , which is time - dependent in a general case , see fig .",
    "it is convenient to express the atomic collective spin variables through bosonic fields @xmath17 , where @xmath17 annihilates an atom in the state @xmath18 , @xmath19 , at the point @xmath11 at time @xmath20 .",
    "the set of equations for these bosonic fields and the signal photons is @xmath21 which is an obvious generalization from the case of eit in a @xmath0-medium @xcite to the case of tripod medium .",
    "the atom - field coupling constant @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electric dipole moment of the transition @xmath10 and @xmath24 is the effective area of the signal beam , can be expressed through the optical density @xmath25 of the medium for the resonant signal light as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of atoms inside the interaction volume @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the atomic sample length in the propagation direction .",

    "[ au-3 ]      if we consider asymptotically long times , such that @xmath112 we immediately see that asymptotically @xmath113 this means that the spin excitations in the medium , being coupled to the @xmath51-type dark - state polariton mode via the two - photon detuning @xmath82 , decay in a very slow , non - exponential way , namely , proportionally to @xmath114 .    what occurs for @xmath89 not too much exceeding @xmath93",

    "if the incoming signal photons are tuned exactly in resonance with the @xmath120 transition , then @xmath121 , the the convergence of the integrals in eq . ( [ int - y2 ] ) is achieved on the time scale of about @xmath122 and eq .",

    "therefore the efficiency of conversion of signal photons into spin excitations of the @xmath52-type is @xmath130 for @xmath105 ( say , @xmath131 ) this efficiency may get very close to 1 .",
    "of course , at very large times @xmath132 decays , as we have shown , in proportion to @xmath114 . but one can prevent such a long - time decay of the spin excitations by radiating photons out of the medium by sudden switching off the control fields ( or by sudden changing @xmath49 from @xmath82 to 0 and thus decoupling the @xmath51-type and @xmath52-type polaritons ) .",
    "this means that the use of a tripod medium permits one to trap and convert into spin excitations very long signal light pulses , which would be only partially fit into a medium with a standard @xmath0-scheme of atomic levels .",
    "the retrieval of the stored quanta may be implemented using the standard protocol @xcite ( note also the observed modulation of the retrieved pulse shape @xcite ) .",

    "[ au-2 ] that for a perfectly resonant signal light the maximum efficiency is always appreachiably below 1 . on the contrary , if the probe light is detuned by @xmath139 from the frequency @xmath14 , than the values of @xmath88 very close to 1 can be attained , see fig .",

    "this means that for a large optical depth and long enough pulses , @xmath150 the condition ( [ cond-1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "to summarize , we investigated theoretically the propagation of weak signal pulses in a medium with a tripod scheme of atomic levels in the slow - light regime .",
    "dark - state polaritons of two kinds exist in such a medium .",
    "when they are mutually coupled via non - zero detuning @xmath16 of one of the control fields , the propagation becomes non - trivial . in the case of constant detuning , @xmath151",
    ", the propagation bears analogy with the relativistic physics because its green s function is formally identical to that of the klein ",

    "the light pulse leaving the medium has a very long  tail \" decreasing as @xmath114 . under certain conditions [ eq .",

    "fast switching off the control fields or setting @xmath16 to zero prevents the spin excitations from decay through the radiation of photons in the forward direction and leads to their storage in the medium .",
    "note that the proposed scheme may be termed  passive \" , since it , unlike the conventional one @xcite , does not require gradual tuning of the control field during the signal pulse propagation in the medium , but implies instead rapid switching off of both the control fields or a fast change of @xmath16 to zero , as soon as the maximum conversion efficiency is achieved .",
