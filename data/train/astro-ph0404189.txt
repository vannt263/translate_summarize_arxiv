    "over the last decade , the importance of young massive star clusters as signposts to major star formation events has been recognized . in particular , the discovery of young globular clusters ( gcs ) in galactic mergers and young merger remnants using _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) imaging ( e.g. , schweizer 2002 and references therein ) has generated a great deal of excitement .",
    "this is hardly surprising , as these clusters have provided previously unexpected opportunities including _ (",
    "i ) _ the chance to study the formation and evolution of gcs in the local universe rather than trying to derive how they formed @xmath014 gyr ago ; _ ( ii ) _ the possibility to age - date merger events ( i.e. , major star formation epochs ) in galaxies from star clusters with simple , single - burst stellar populations",
    ".    in many cases , follow - up spectroscopy of these young clusters confirmed their nature as star cluster and their ages , and in one case even their high masses predicted from their colors and luminosities ( maraston et al .",
    "the metallicities of the young clusters have been found to be near solar , as expected for clusters formed out of enriched gas in spiral disks .",
    "such metal - rich clusters are now known in merger remnants at essentially all ages , ranging from birth ( e.g. , ngc  4038/4039 , whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) through youth ( several 10@xmath1 yrs , e.g.  ngc 7252 , schweizer & seitzer 1998 ) to middle age , when only faint ripples and loops reveal their merger history ( e.g. ngc  1316 , goudfrooij et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the cluster systems of young merger remnants were also found to contain fainter , redder objects with colors and luminosities consistent with those of old , metal - poor halo gcs that are very common in nearby galaxies such as the milky way .",
    "it is commonly believed that these fainter gcs in merger remnants probably belonged to the ( now merged ) progenitor spirals .",
    "this bimodality in star cluster systems of young merger remnants is rather interesting in the context of formation scenarios for _ normal _ elliptical galaxies , since the latter are also well known to generally host gc systems with bimodal color distributions ( kundu & whitmore 2001 ; larsen et al .",
    "2001 to name a few ) .",
    "deep _ hst _ imaging of ` normal ' ellipticals shows that roughly half of their gcs are blue ( metal - poor ) and half are red ( metal - rich , typically roughly solar or somewhat less ) .",
    "spectroscopy with 10-m class telescopes revealed that both ` blue ' and ` red ' gc subpopulations of ` normal ' ellipticals are typically old ( @xmath28 gyr , cohen , blakeslee & ct 2003 ; puzia et al .",
    "a natural interpretation of these data is that the metal - rich gcs in ` normal ' ellipticals formed in gas - rich mergers at @xmath3 , and that the formation process of galaxies with significant populations of metal - rich gcs was similar to that in galaxy mergers observed today .",
    "one might think `` now do nt get carried away '' at this point , and indeed it is important to examine this scenario in detail . if correct , one _ should _ be able to _",
    "( i ) _ find ellipticals with second - generation gcs of intermediate age ( i.e. , 25 gyr ) and _ ( ii ) _ study the evolution of second - generation gc systems from young through intermediate to old ages , and compare their properties with theoretical predictions .",
    "these two issues are addressed in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the existence of intermediate - age gc systems has been argued for several years already , based on gc colors and luminosities from deep optical photometry of ellipticals with high fine structure such as ripples and tidal features ( e.g. , whitmore et al .",
    "the breakthrough in identifying intermediate - age gcs came by using methods that break the age - metallicity degeneracy present in optical colors , namely the use of optical - to - near - ir colors and spectroscopy with large telescopes .",
    "goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2001a , b ) used both methods to discover a major @xmath03 gyr old , metal - rich gc population in the merger remnant ngc  1316 , discussed further below . soon afterward ,",
    "puzia et al .  (",
    "2002 ) identified a significant population of intermediate - age gcs in the elliptical galaxy ngc  4365 ( featuring a counter - rotating core ) using @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6-band photometry .",
    "follow - up keck spectroscopy of a subset of the puzia et al",
    ".  gcs by larsen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) confirmed the effectiveness of the optical - to - near - ir technique , which was subsequently used by hempel et al.(2003 ) who identified intermediate - age gcs in ngc  5846 as well .",
    "other investigations using this method are ongoing .",
    "now that the presence of intermediate - age gc systems has been established , time has come to test whether or not properties of gc systems formed in mergers are compatible with those of ` red ' gcs in old ellipticals .",
    "if so , this would render them a definite evolutionary link between young remnants and ` normal ' ellipticals with bimodal gc color distributions .",
    "one of the most important tracers of such systematic evolution is the luminosity function ( lf ) of second - generation gcs .",
    "the lf of ` old ' gc systems is a gaussian in magnitude units , with a peak ( ` turnover ' ) at @xmath7 ( e.g. , harris 1996 ) , while that of gclf s in young merger remnants is a power law with index @xmath8 ( e.g. , whitmore et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the transition from power law to gaussian lf has been predicted theoretically ( fall & zhang 2001 ) , being a consequence of preferential erosion of low - mass gcs due to various disruption mechanisms , of which the main ones are internal two - body relaxation and tidal shocking . _",
    "if indeed the metal - rich gcs in ` old ' giant ellipticals are evolved gcs formed during a gas - rich merger , this gradual erosion should be evident in observed lfs of second - generation gc systems that form an age sequence_. this critical test of the ` merger hypothesis ' was infeasible until recently , due to the necessity to reach @xmath02 mag beyond the turnover magnitude .",
    "however , the unprecedented sensitivity of the _ acs _ camera , installed on _ hst _ in march 2002 , made this possible .",
    "we observed ngc  1316 in march 2003 using the wide - field channel of _ hst / acs _ through the f435w , f555w , and f814w filters , with total exposure times of 1860 s , 14560 s , and 4770 s , respectively .",
    "the supreme spatial resolution of the new _ acs _ images allowed us to impose stringent _ size constraints _ on the list of detected compact objects so as to exclude extended background galaxies as well as foreground stars . due to space restrictions",
    ", i will only show the main result here : _ an observational confirmation of the predicted dynamical evolution of the lf of a",
    "second - generation , metal - rich gc system_. a paper containing a more detailed presentation and discussion of the results of this study has been submitted to a refereed journal .",
    "the new _ acs _ images allowed us to reach a factor of @xmath04.5 fainter in luminosity than with the wfpc2 observations presented in goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2001b ; hereafter paper i ) , which resulted in a final gc candidate list of 1496 objects - almost four times as many as from the wfpc2 images ( ! ) .",
    "metal - poor ( blue ) gcs were selected using @xmath9 ( just redward of the reddest halo gc in our galaxy ) , whereas metal - rich ( red ) gcs were selected using @xmath10 .",
    "correction for contamination by _ compact _ background galaxies was done in a statistical way , using wfpc2 f555w and f814w images that were taken in parallel with the _ acs _ data .",
    "after this correction , the lfs of the blue and red subpopulations were produced : see panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  1 .",
    "the blue gc system shows a gaussian lf consistent with that of the gc system of ` normal ' , old ellipticals , as expected and as found by paper i. the lf of the red gc system as a whole exhibits a power - law behavior with slope @xmath11 ( as was found in paper i using the earlier wfpc2 data ) .",
    "although there is an indication of flattening out beyond @xmath12 , this does not seem to constitute strong evidence for the expected disruption of the low - mass end of the second - generation gcs .",
    "_ however _ , the effect of cluster disruption processes should show up first in the central regions of galaxies since the disruption timescale of gcs scales with galactocentric distance ( e.g. , vesperini & heggie 1997 ; fall & zhang 2001 ) . with the huge number of detected gc candidates in the _ acs _ data , we are now in a position to produce gc lfs in different radial intervals with adequate statistical significance . and indeed , as panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "1 show , the lf of the outer 50% of the red gcs reveals a power - law down to its 50% completeness limit , whereas the lf of the inner 50% of the red gcs _ does _ shows a turnover at @xmath13 , i.e.   @xmath01 mag fainter than the turnover of ` old ' gc systems .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the workshop organizers for a _ great _ workshop that brought together researchers from a variety of fields related to star cluster research .",
    "i thank my collaborators on this project :  diane karakla , franois schweizer , and brad whitmore .",
