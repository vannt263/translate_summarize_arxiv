    "ever since the discovery of quasars with redshifts sufficiently large to bring the ly@xmath8 resonance line of neutral hydrogen into the optical band , the possibility of using this line to probe conditions in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has engendered intense interest .",
    "gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) showed that a diffuse , uniform igm having the critical density must have been very highly ionized at @xmath33 to avoid producing a very large hi opacity at wavelengths just below that of the quasar s ly@xmath8 emission line .",
    "motivated by the gunn - peterson idea , bahcall & salpeter ( 1965 ) pointed out that the gunn - peterson effect could be used to probe the igm at various redshifts ( and for other elements ) , and also suggested that gas that was not uniformly distributed would produce discrete ly@xmath8 absorption lines .",
    "they were then thinking specifically of gas clumped into clusters of galaxies , but a small generalization will allow us to refer to any localized ly@xmath8 absorption in the igm as the `` bahcall - salpeter effect '' .",
    "the subsequent discovery of large numbers of discrete absorption lines at wavelengths below redshifted ly@xmath8 ( lynds 1971 ) lead to the description of this phenomenon as the `` ly@xmath8 forest '' .",
    "their large numbers showed that these forest lines could not be associated with galaxy clusters , and after a period of uncertainty as to whether the lines might be associated with local material ejected from the quasars at high velocities , the idea took hold that the ly@xmath8 lines arise in discrete intergalactic clouds at various cosmological redshifts along the line of sight ( sargent et al .",
    "1980 ; weymann , carswell & smith 1981 ; blades , turnshek & norman 1988 ) .",
    "observations at relatively high spectral resolution revealed no continuous absorption between the discrete lines , placing strong limits on the gunn - peterson effect , and leading to the idea that the ly@xmath8 `` clouds '' might be confined by the pressure of a diffuse , very hot , intercloud medium . over time",
    "this two phase notion lead to the identification of the _ intercloud _ medium with the _ intergalactic _ medium , while the ly@xmath8 clouds became a somewhat separate subject of study .    in this paper",
    "we wish to resurrect the concept of a unified , though not uniform , intergalactic medium , consisting of all the gas that has not collapsed into systems with densities much more than an order of magnitude above the mean baryon density of the universe . in the model we have developed , relatively small amplitude fluctuations in the density of the igm can explain numerous aspects previously attributed to the discrete cloud picture .",
    "we suggest that the ly@xmath8 forest is nothing more than the observable manifestation of the bahcall - salpeter effect , which is in turn just a generalization of the gunn - peterson effect to the case of a nonuniform intergalactic medium .",
    "our approach has the merit of great simplicity , with numerous predictions following from a small number of fundamental assumptions .",
    "the most important of these assumptions is that the probability distribution function of the density of diffuse matter in the universe is described by a lognormal ( ln ) random field .",
    "the ln distribution has several attractive features and follows plausibly from the assumption of initial linear gaussian density and velocity fluctuations at arbitrarily early time ( coles & jones 1991 ) .",
    "it has the correct asymptotic behavior on large scales or at very early times where the igm evolves linearly , and it matches the isothermal hydrostatic solution on very small scales such as that for intracluster gas .",
    "we also find it to be roughly correct when compared to the statistics of the density distribution in some recent numerical simulations ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "we further assume that the igm is photoionized by a metagalactic uv radiation field whose intensity is sufficient at @xmath34 to reduce the neutral fraction of hydrogen to less than @xmath35 for gas at the mean density . with a suitable choice of @xmath36 , taken to be the nominal baryon density from standard big bang nucleosynthesis , for example",
    ", this assumption can be satisfied using the intensity provided by the known quasar population .",
    "our investigation of the model developed here has been motivated by the recent detection of the heii gunn - peterson / bahcall - salpeter effect ( miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 : davidsen 1993 ; and miralda - escud 1993 ) with the hubble space telescope ( jakobsen et al .",
    "1994 ; tytler et al . 1995 ) and the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( davidsen & fountain 1985 ; davidsen 1993 ; davidsen , kriss & zheng 1996 , hereafter dkz ) .",
    "the hut observation of hs1700 + 64 yielded an effective heii ly@xmath8 opacity @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "this opacity is too large to be accounted for using the canonical ly@xmath8 cloud picture , and lower column density clouds ( @xmath39 @xmath13 ) and/or diffuse gas are needed to explain more than half of the measured he ii opacity toward hs1700 + 64 ( dkz ; zheng , davidsen & kriss 1996 ) .",
    "the very low density gas in our model contributes very little to the h i opacity , but because the number ratio between he ii ions and h i atoms resulting from photoionization by the uv background is large ( i.e. @xmath40  200 ) , it contributes very significantly to the he ii opacity . in this paper",
    "we develop our igm model and concentrate on comparisons with observations of the hi ly@xmath8 forest and with other theoretical work .",
    "application of the model to the heii observations will be discussed in davidsen et al .",
    "some of the ideas employed in our model have previously been discussed by bi , brner & chu ( 1992 ) , bi ( 1993 ) and references therein .",
    "ly@xmath8 clouds were suggested to be confined either by an intercloud medium ( pressure confinement , e.g. sargent et al .",
    "1980 ) , or by dark matter mini - halos ( rees 1986 ) .",
    "a very hot baryonic medium would distort the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation through the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "the recent upper limit of the so - called y - parameter has ruled out any cosmologically distributed component of temperature greater than @xmath41 ( wright et al .",
    "thus , the pressure confinement seems unfavored by the cobe results . in the original mini - halo model",
    ", baryons are presumed to reside statically in dark matter potential wells . in our model , we allow baryons to move in or out of the wells , depending on the strength of the well .",
    "so the dark matter potential wells are more like magnets that direct the motion of baryons but do not trap them . removing the confinement requirement will introduce a larger cloud size as observed by dinshaw et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and bechtold et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "historically , there have been several ideas related to unconfined clouds .",
    "black ( 1981 ) and oort ( 1981 ) suggested that the ly@xmath8 forest might represent relic primordial fluctuations having a characteristic length scale @xmath42 mpc . by assuming uv photoionization heating , ostriker & ikeuchi ( 1983 ) calculated the temperature of the igm to be about @xmath43 k , very close to that inferred from the widths of the ly@xmath8 lines . even in the mini halo model",
    ", the clouds may act like transient phenomena because the halos merge frequently at high redshift .",
    "the first non - static cloud model was studied by bond , szalay & silk ( 1988 ) who suggested that clouds were in a free expansion phase .",
    "mcgill ( 1991 ) illustrated preliminarily that an igm with the fluctuation variance @xmath44 could also produce line - like absorptions in quasar spectra through caustic structures in its peculiar velocity field .",
    "bi , brner & chu ( 1992 ) and bi ( 1993 ) considered a more physical igm evolution in the hierarchical clustering model and the cold - dark - matter model .",
    "they found that such a median fluctuated igm contains the correct number of density clumps , which have sizes comparable to the jeans length , and would produce ly@xmath8 absorption lines compatible with what are observed .",
    "the velocity caustics are a secondary effect when compared to the density fluctuation .",
    "the similarity between two nearby absorption profiles , such as seen in gravitationally - lensed quasar spectra , can be consistently accounted for by coherent clustering in the density too .",
    "therefore they suggested that such an alternative phase of the igm should have played a role in the ly@xmath8 forest as important as the conventional clouds .",
    "the reason that the @xmath45 igm can produce distinguishable line features is that the absorption profile is an exponential function of the optical depth @xmath46 , which in turn is approximately proportional to the square of the baryonic density .",
    "therefore a small enhancement ( i.e. an overdensity over the local background ) in the igm would result in a large change in @xmath47 at @xmath48 and then appear as a deep absorption line .",
    "the actual fluctuation picture can be obtained by cosmological n - body and hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "recent simulations by cen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , zhang , anninos & norman ( 1995 ) , hernquist et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and miralda - escud et al ( 1996 ) have solved hydrodynamical equations from first principles and have set up a firm evolutionary picture of the igm .",
    "although they use different techniques and cosmological models , all the simulations indicate a median fluctuated igm instead of discrete clouds . for instance , from an analysis of published simulations we found the variance of the igm density is just about 1 at @xmath49 in cen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and miralda - escud et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "the density , temperature and thermal pressure of the medium are continuous fields that can not be attributed simply to gravitational confinement or pressure confinement . yet the ly@xmath8 forest can be produced naturally .",
    "what are the geometry , ionization degree , thermal state and ly@xmath8 absorption properties of absorbers in the igm ?",
    "how do the statistical quantities evolve in redshift ?",
    "the present paper will study these questions in detail .",
    "related work can be found in miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter mcor ) .",
    "because of our analytical approach , our simulation can be performed in 1-d , i.e. along one line of sight .",
    "this enables us to have a simulation box size almost arbitrarily large , which is necessary for large - scale fluctuation components , as well as to have a very small grid in the same simulation for revealing fine structures _ within",
    "_ ly@xmath8 clouds .",
    "different cosmological models with different choices of free parameters can be computed relatively quickly to check various diagnostics in our igm simulation .",
    "flat universe models dominated by cold dark matter , with or without a cosmological constant , will be considered in this paper .",
    "we will discuss the assumption of the lognormal field , and our simulation procedure in section 2 . in section 3.1 , the evolution of the volume filling factor and cumulative mass fraction for",
    "different density thresholds will show why the igm should be regarded as a diffuse and continuous medium .",
    "several statistical properties of ly@xmath8 absorbers are discussed in section 3.2 , including characteristic size , mean density and neutral fraction .",
    "velocity and density structures within clouds will be studied in section 3.3 .",
    "the evolution of hi opacity , cloud number counts @xmath50 , and the hi column density distribution will be discussed and compared to observations in section 4 . in section 5 , we compare simulation samples with a high resolution keck observation of hs1700 + 64 .",
    "they agree surprisingly well with each other , not only in general appearance but also in their @xmath28 parameters , spectral filling factors and spectral autocorrelation coefficients .",
    "we have also made some comparisons to mcor s simulation in that section .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the density distribution of the igm is assumed to be a lognormal random field , @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the mean number density and @xmath53 is a gaussian random field derived from the density contrast @xmath54 of dark matter : @xmath55 in the comoving space or the fourier space , respectively .",
    "the comoving scale @xmath56 is defined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the mean temperature and molecular weight of the igm ; @xmath60 is the cosmological density parameter of total mass ; and @xmath61 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "the scale @xmath56 is @xmath62 times smaller than the standard jeans length @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the sound speed in the igm and @xmath65 is the total cosmological mass density ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the ln approach was introduced by coles & jones ( 1991 ) to describe the non - linear evolution of dark matter . here",
    "we apply it to the baryonic matter in the igm .",
    "we first discuss the physical background of the ln approach .    at early epochs @xmath66 or on large scales @xmath67 ,",
    "fluctuations are small , so we have @xmath68 in eq .",
    "this is just the expected linear evolution of the igm ( peebles 1974 ; fang et al .",
    "on very small scales , we have @xmath69 in eq .",
    "2 ; thus eq .",
    "1 becomes the well - known isothermal hydrostatic solution , which describes highly clumped structures such as intracluster gas , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the dark matter potential ( sarazin & bahcall 1977 ) .    during the linear evolution of dark matter fluctuations ,",
    "@xmath71 is constant , being as small as that at the decoupling time .",
    "therefore , one expects that the potential would remain linear much longer than the density ; consequently one can simply use the unchanged primordial potential in the whole calculation .",
    "this frozen potential approximation has been tested and found to work well against n - body simulations , and is apparently superior to the zeldovich approximation or the frozen - flow approximation ( brainerd , scherrer & villumsen 1983 ; bagla & padmanabhan 1994 ) . as long as the dark matter potential",
    "is fixed , baryons will move toward the minima in the potential , which are 2-dimensional pancakes .",
    "if the evolution is long enough , the final configuration will be the isothermal hydrostatic solution .    in the ln distribution , the 3-d configuration of the igm",
    "is uniquely determined by the primordial distribution .",
    "this can be compared to a recent non - linear clustering model , the peak patch theory ( bond , kofman & pogosyan 1996 ) .",
    "n - body simulations indicated that the final non - linear density field can be fairly reconstructed from individual  peak patches \" existing in the original distribution .",
    "the ln approach can be viewed alternatively as a very simplified representation of the theory , in which all small scale collisons between nearby particles are negelected .    among all smooth functions that can link the known linear solution and the hydrostatic solution asymptotically ,",
    "the ln function is the simplest one .",
    "furthermore , it always defines a positive igm density .",
    "in contrast , any smooth polynomial function of @xmath53 will output negative density @xmath72 when @xmath73 . because @xmath53 is identified as the density contrast in the linear evolution , eq . 1 transforms the extrapolated linear density to the nonlinear counterpart",
    ".    our conjecture can be tested by comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we have made a statistical histogram of @xmath74 at @xmath49 in mcor s fig .",
    "7 , which turns out to be fitted well by a gaussian probability function with variance @xmath75 and the mean -0.52 .",
    "note that according to eq .",
    "1 , the mean should be equal to @xmath76 . based on the same cosmological model",
    ", our analytical calculation leads to @xmath77 , which is only slighter greater .",
    "we found that the results discussed later in the paper are not altered substantially if the smaller variance is adopted .",
    "hence , we suggest that the ln model is a simple , yet acceptable model for the density distribution of the igm .    a gaussian random field is uniquely determined by its power spectrum .",
    "we will use the cold - dark - matter power spectrum in our simulation of @xmath53 .",
    "this is ( efstathiou , bond & white 1992 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the normalized hubble parameter .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum can be normalized by the cobe rms quadruple @xmath81k . if normalized in this way with @xmath82 , the model @xmath32 and @xmath2 predicts a correlation function higher than that observed on scales of @xmath83mpc ( efstathiou at al .",
    "therefore , efstathiou at al . suggested replacing @xmath82 with @xmath3 in eq .",
    "5 . we will call this _ the cdm model _ in this paper .",
    "another possibility to get a lower @xmath84 is to introduce a cosmological constant @xmath85 so that @xmath86 .",
    "mcor s simulation is based on such a model .",
    "we will use the same parameters and normalization as mcor s , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and the present fluctuation variance 0.79 on the scale of 8@xmath89mpc .",
    "we call this _ the lcdm model_. we note that if the lcdm model is normalized by the cobe value , the fluctuation variance will be increased by approximately 30% and its fit to the observations will not be as good .",
    "all our simulations are performed equally for both the models .",
    "the mean igm temperature , which is @xmath43 k between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , can be calculated unambiguously when uv photo - ionization is the only heating source ( ostriker & ikeuchi 1983 ) . the thermal equation of state of the igm is assumed to be polytropic , @xmath92 . in the linear evolution , one can prove that @xmath93 ; in mcor s simulation ( their fig .",
    "7 ) , we find this relation is best fit by @xmath94 , which is also preferred in the calculation of miralda - escud & rees ( 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , the lowest temperature in mcor does not drop to zero , but is limited at the photo - ionization temperature @xmath95 k. we will use @xmath96 , the constant temperature @xmath97 k at the mean density @xmath52 , and a minimum temperature @xmath98 k to approximate the variation of @xmath99 with @xmath72 in the igm .",
    "our final results are very weakly dependent on the choice of @xmath61 or the minimum temperature . however , in the polytropic igm , most mass resides in moderately high density regions where the temperature is considerably higher than @xmath100 .",
    "we should therefore use a density - averaged temperature @xmath58 in the calculation of the jeans length to account for this effect . because @xmath101 at large @xmath102 in eq .",
    "2 , such a change is not trivial for the lcdm model , or at @xmath103 in both models , when the clustering is strong .",
    "this introduces a factor of 2 ( or even greater ) difference between @xmath100 and @xmath58 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath100 is used in the calculation of the jeans length , the resultant @xmath104 of the igm will be about 2.0 at @xmath49 in the lcdm model ; this is too large when compared to mcor s value of 1.0 .",
    "hydrogen atoms in the igm are photo - ionized by the uv background radiation , which is assumed to be @xmath105 ergs s@xmath106 hz@xmath106 @xmath13 sr@xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the frequency of the h i ionization threshold .",
    "the optical depth is proportional to the combination of @xmath108 , @xmath36 and @xmath80 through @xmath109 ; therefore , we fix @xmath36 to the primordial density , @xmath110 ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ) , and let @xmath108 be a free parameter .    the absorption optical depth at redshift @xmath111 is @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath104 is the absorption cross section at the ly@xmath8 transition , @xmath114 is the normalized comoving coordinate , @xmath115 @xmath116 , @xmath117 is the standard voigt function , @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the peculiar velocity measured in units of @xmath120 .",
    "there are two major effects of the velocity : 1 ) shifting lines to slightly different position and 2 ) altering line profiles by bulk motions through velocity gradients .",
    "the first effect is not important if we are not interested in clustering properties of lines .",
    "the second effect can make lines narrower , since in comoving space mass is falling toward the center of the cloud . only clouds with @xmath121 @xmath13 are expanding in comoving space ( see  3.3 ) and",
    "consequently have broader line profiles , but these lines are not observable . in the present paper , we will use the linear estimate for the peculiar velocity .",
    "the success of the zeldovich approximation indicates that the velocity can be described by linear theory in the early non - linear stages .",
    "( note the velocity is the first derivative of the potential and the density is the second derivative ) .",
    "here is the summary of the simulation procedure .",
    "we first simulate @xmath122 and @xmath123 in a line of sight at discrete @xmath124 in the fourier space .",
    "they are two correlated gaussian random fields and can be written as linear combinations of two independent gaussian fields @xmath125 and @xmath126 of power spectra @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively ( see bi 1993 and bi , ge & fang 1995 ) : @xmath129 @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the linear growth factors for @xmath53 and @xmath133 at redshift @xmath9 ( peebles 1993 ) . functions @xmath8 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are : @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 with @xmath139 being the present 3-d power spectrum of the igm .",
    "the corresponding distributions in the real line - of - sight space can be obtained by using a fast fourier transform .",
    "typically , @xmath140 and the length of the simulation is @xmath141 in redshift , corresponding to the grid size 4.5 @xmath89kpc and the simulation box size 75 @xmath89mpc in comoving space at @xmath49 in the @xmath1 model .",
    "the grid is fine enough to reveal detailed structures in clouds .",
    "the box length is long enough to incorporate most fluctuation powers .",
    "greater @xmath142 ( e.g. @xmath143 ) has also been tested with no difference found .",
    "the neutral hydrogen density @xmath144 and the ly@xmath8 optical depth are calculated directly at each grid point according to our assumption of photo - ionization equilibrium and eq .",

    "the line - of - sight distributions of peculiar velocity and neutral density _ within _ clouds have been plotted ( as the solid curves ) vs. the comoving separation from the center of cloud in the cdm and lcdm models in fig . 6 at @xmath204 .",
    "the successive curves with increasing peak values are mean profiles of all clouds between @xmath205 @xmath13 , @xmath206 @xmath13 , ... , @xmath207 @xmath13 correspondingly .",
    "the dashed curves show the same plots if we do not use the smoothed reference field to select clouds , but count _ any _ maximum in the density distribution as one cloud .",
    "the peculiar velocity shows that mass is falling toward the cloud centers in comoving space except for @xmath208 @xmath13 . for clouds with @xmath209 @xmath13 , the bulk velocities are just comparable to the thermal broadening ;",

    "the velocity is also larger in the lcdm model than in the cdm model at the same column density .    below @xmath211 @xmath13 ,",
    "the peculiar velocities are smaller than the hubble velocity at all distances ; therefore , at @xmath49 the clouds are still expanding in proper coordinates , although in comoving space , they are condensing . the neutral column density , which is proportional to the square of the proper density of total mass , decreases with cosmic time .",
    "thus the same cloud will have a higher column density at @xmath171 than at @xmath33 .",

    "we note this @xmath216 is close to @xmath56 in eq .",
    "2 ; therefore , the density declines exponentially outside the jeans radius .",
    "if we take all maxima in the density distribution as separate clouds , the cloud sizes and peculiar velocities become about half as large , but their spatial structures ( i.e. the dashed curves ) are similar .",
    "an important point is that not only the velocity but also the exponential density profile , which extends far away from the center of a cloud without a cut - off , will affect absorption line profiles .",
    "we call this _ the absorption from density wings_. for instance , in the cdm model , a cloud with @xmath217 @xmath13 will have @xmath218 @xmath219 at 0.8 @xmath89mpc , which is comparable to the peak density of a typical @xmath220 @xmath13 cloud .",
    "therefore , the wing density at 0.8 @xmath89mpc , or 137 km s@xmath106 in velocity at @xmath49 , is still contributing a noticeable absorption depth , since the @xmath221 @xmath13 column density is just detectable in observations .",
    "the resulting ly@xmath8 profile is thus much _ broader _ than the pure voigt profile of the cloud at the same column density but with all mass at its center .",
    "this effect exists in all clouds . as a short summary ,",
    "the velocity sharpens lines at column density above @xmath183 @xmath13 , but the wing absorption broadens lines in the same way for all absorbers .",
    "hence , we have three kinds of departures from the voigt profile : the density wing , the peculiar velocity and the line - blending effect .",
    "to4.5 in    ' '' ''    in real observations , the column density and velocity fitted by multiple voigt profiles will be significantly different from the intrinsic column density because of line - blending and fluctuations . for an arbitrary absorber",
    ", it is almost impossible to say which effect  the internal temperature , the peculiar velocity , or the density wing  plays the most important role .",
    "an exception is for _ isolated _ clouds with @xmath39 @xmath13 : they are on the linear part of the curve - of - growth and thus have unchanged @xmath189 ; but their @xmath28 parameters will be significantly boosted by the wing absorption .    how the fitted parameters differ from actual parameters will deserve a careful statistical study .",

    "consequently we obtain more opacity at low redshift and less opacity at high redshift than what is expected for a uniform igm .",
    "the power law of the evolution is thus changed from index 3.5 to 2.1 in our simulation .",
    "the agreement between the observations and the model is acceptable with a constant uv flux for @xmath34 ; evolution of @xmath108 over this range of redshifts is therefore not required .",

    "the three curves at @xmath193 and 4 can be shifted to overlap each other in the x - axis .",
    "this shows an important fact : that the evolution of the ly@xmath8 forest is not due to creating or destroying of new clouds , but due to a _ change of column density in the same clouds_. because of the expansion of the universe , clouds have smaller mass density ( and neutral density ) at low redshifts than at high redshifts .",

    "although the initial density distribution contains fluctuation powers on scales @xmath286mpc , no correlation can be found in the spectral coefficients on these large scales because the signals are too weak .",
    "a useful statistical quantity is the cumulative distribution of the transmitted flux ( see mcor ) , or _ spectral filling factor_. the observational calculation of the keck spectrum is shown as the heavy solid curve in fig .",
    "the light solid curve and the dotted curve are from synthetic spectra in the cdm and lcdm models , respectively . in order to mimic the observation best ,",
    "the simulation samples were performed in the redshift interval 2.2 to 2.6 ; in each pixel independent gaussian noise of zero mean and variance 0.04 has been added to match the noise in the keck spectrum .",
    "the statistical 1@xmath104 error bars are so small that we may ignore them in the figure .",

    "the filling factor of the cdm model agrees well with that observed except for a small difference @xmath287 at large fluxes .",
    "as we have pointed out early in the paper , the present igm model contains very few or no lyman limit systems or damped systems .",
    "but the real keck spectrum does .",
    "since these clouds have always absorbed flux to zero , adding them to the model will account for the difference to allowed error bars .",
    "the lcdm model has stronger clustering and thus slightly less low density clumps , or equivalently , less shallow spectral absorptions .",
    "the density fluctuation in this model is 1.25 , compared to 1.18 in the cdm model .",
    "both the models are successful in explaining the existence of very weak absorption features .    in an igm with a very high variance",
    ", most of the mass would reside in discrete clumps ( or clouds ) and most of the volume would be nearly empty as underdense regions are destroyed .",
    "due also to the saturation of overdense clouds in the ly@xmath8 absorption , such a medium would require a lower uv background radiation to give the correct hi gunn - peterson opacity .",
    "( for the heii gp opacity , the medium would require a very high population ratio . )",
    "this is the case for the old , `` standard '' cold - dark - matter ( scdm ) model with @xmath82 , which has @xmath288 at @xmath38 . in order to get the correct effective opacity",
    ", we need to use @xmath289 , which is much too small to be consistent with the proximity effect .",
    "the strong clustering of the model will also produce a very different spectral filling factor function , as shown in fig .",
    "to3.0 in    ' '' ''    on the other hand , an igm with too low a variance would have difficulty in making line - like features in the ly@xmath8 absorption because of insufficient density variations within clouds . since more clouds are not saturated , we need a higher uv flux for the correct ionization and the effective opacity",
    ". however , the absorption would become severely blended even at low redshifts .",
    "for example , the cold - plus - hot dark - matter ( chdm ) model with @xmath290 ( e.g. klypin et al .",
    "1993 ) has @xmath291 at @xmath33 .",
    "we need @xmath292 to get the correct effective opacity , but the absorption spectrum will look too blended to be acceptable in the simulations . we expect to see a different spectral filling factor function too .",
    "the spectral filling factors in the scdm and chdm models are plotted as the dashed and long dashed curves in fig .",
    "although we can change @xmath108 to obtain the observed opacity , these model distributions in the figure are completely inconsistent with the observation .",
    "we thus conclude that the @xmath3 cdm model and the lcdm model are favored not only by other cosmological considerations but also by ly@xmath8 forest observations . the @xmath82 scdm model and the chdm model",
    "fail in the test of the ly@xmath8 forest .",
    "besides using real observations , we can compare our lcdm model with the same model in mcor in order to check how it compares with hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "some of the comparisons have already been discussed above ( e.g fig . 4c and fig .",
    "the spectral filling factor function provides another excellent comparison .",
    "17 shows such filling factors at three redshifts @xmath33 , 3 and 4 in our lcdm model . unlike fig .",
    "16 , these curves have no added noise .",

    "18 is a plot of the mass fraction coming from pixels that have transmitted flux smaller than a threshold value @xmath293 ( see fig . 21 of mcor ) .",
    "mcor have a different procedure to simulate a spectrum , i.e. they first transform the density distribution into velocity space using the peculiar velocity and then calculate the absorption spectrum regardless of the peculiar velocity .",
    "therefore , the mass fraction they derived in their fig .",
    "21 is in velocity space , instead of the original comoving space . in order to account for the difference",
    ", we use zero velocity in the calculation of fig .",
    "our plots agree with the corresponding plots of mcor in general , although we are using a quite different approach to the problem .",
    "there are two other factors that may bring uncertainties into the comparisons .",
    "first , mcor did not use the voigt profile , but used the pure thermal gaussian profile in their spectral calculation .",
    "second , the grid size in their simulation is 34@xmath89kpc in comoving space , so their spectrum can not be resolved below this limit ( 4.4@xmath89 km s@xmath106 in velocity ) .",
    "both of these factors can account for the small differences between the results of our calculations and theirs .",
    "to2.8 in    ' '' ''",
    "in this paper , we have argued that the intergalactic medium should be regarded as a continuous medium with density fluctuations that result from the growth of primordial dark matter fluctuations , as opposed to the conventional view of discrete clouds immersed in a smooth intercloud medium . with this paradigm shift , the long - held distinction between the gunn - peterson effect ( arising from the diffuse intercloud medium ) and the bahcall - salpeter effect or ly@xmath8 forest of discrete absorption lines ( arising from denser clouds ) no longer makes sense .",
    "the dividing line between these aspects of the igm is arbitrary .",
    "if one were to use the universal mean baryon density to distinguish between `` clouds '' and the `` intercloud medium '' , for example , this would correspond to absorption features with an estimated column density of about @xmath183 @xmath13 at @xmath49 .",
    "lower column density features typically come from regions that are below the mean density . at @xmath49",
    "our model indicates that about 30 percent of the mass , occupying 70 percent of space , would fall in this category .",
    "most of the baryonic mass is in the moderately overdense fluctuations that produce the well - studied ly@xmath8 forest .        from both our analytical calculation and the hydrodynamic simulation of cen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and mcor , we conclude that the fluctuation variance of the density field of the igm is close to unity in the redshift range ( @xmath294 ) where most of the ly@xmath8 forest is observed .",
    "this is a special phase in the evolution of the igm when both overdense and underdense clumps are significant in appearance .",
    "mass is moving generally from low densities to high densities , but has not yet arrived at the final virialized stage when the clumps are stable in proper space .",
    "dark matter fluctuations would act like magnets that attract the baryonic medium to their potential wells , but do not necessarily confine the baryons .",
    "pressure confinement can not be achieved .",
    "there are no distinguished thermal phases in the medium from which we can discriminate different thermal components .",
    "the whole medium appears as one diffuse and continuous fluid .",
    "this median fluctuation of the igm is important in producing the correct hi opacity and the number of ly@xmath8 lines observed .",
    "the lognormal hypothesis appears to provide an excellent description of the density distribution of intergalactic gas in the non - linear regime at @xmath295 .      in the diffuse igm , our term `` clouds '' actually refers to all fluctuated density clumps which have either overdensity above the mean or underdensity below the mean .",
    "in fact , typical clouds and thus typical ly@xmath8 lines have just the mean mass density .",
    "for example , at redshift 3 , clouds of column density @xmath12 , @xmath183 and @xmath296 @xmath13 have mass density that is 0.1 , 1 and 10 times the mean .",
    "the variation of ( neutral ) density within a cloud is best described by an exponential profile that peaks at the cloud center and declines outside the jeans length .",
    "the origin of the density wing is actually due to the fluctuation nature of the igm in which we can not distinguish one cloud from another in space .",
    "however , the density wing has a very important implication : it broadens the absorption profile significantly",
    ". a wing of any absorber will resemble another cloud with a lower column density .",
    "for instance , a cloud with @xmath297 @xmath13 has the same neutral hydrogen distribution as an @xmath221 @xmath13 cloud at the comoving wing distance 0.8 @xmath89mpc , so it would have the detectable size 0.8 @xmath89mpc .",
    "the peculiar velocity causes mass to fall toward the cloud center where the dark matter potential is minimized in comoving space .",
    "however , all clouds below @xmath25 @xmath13 are still expanding in proper space , because the peculiar velocity is not large enough to overcome the hubble velocity . for clouds above @xmath183 @xmath13 ,",
    "the velocity is comparable to the thermal @xmath28 parameter , so the resulting profile will be narrower .",
    "this effect is just opposite to the density wing . for an individual cloud",
    ", the velocity could appear as turbulent motions because it is not necessarily symmetric .",
    "one effect that has been neglected in the present study is shock waves in the central regions of high column density absorbers , which can be anticipated in the simple zeldovich approximation and have actually been observed in hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. cen et al .",
    "two mass streams from opposite directions along the principal axis are falling toward the center of a pancake . if thermal pressure can not overcome the motions , they will impact each other and leave a cooling mass layer at the cloud center",
    ". such a cooling layer will produce extra neutral hydrogen and thus will enhance the ly@xmath8 absorption opacity .",
    "however , a statistical histogram of density vs. temperature in the simulation of mcor showed this is important only for clouds with @xmath298 @xmath13 .",
    "most of ly@xmath8 forest cloud discussed in this paper will not be affected by such shock waves .",
    "the total number of all clumps in the igm is determined by the number of dark matter potential wells when smoothed on the jeans scale . since the jeans length is roughly a constant in comoving space , the `` global '' number will be more or less fixed .",
    "the same cloud with a high column density will evolve to lower and lower column densities at later times because the proper density is decreasing .",
    "the column density distribution function at one redshift can be identified with that at a lower redshift by shifting the column density by a constant decreasing factor .",
    "thus we expect to have more low column density absorbers at @xmath33 than at @xmath171 .",
    "our simulation is based on the assumption that the uv background intensity is constant between @xmath171 and @xmath33 , yet the effective opacity and the number counts of ly@xmath8 lines are quite consistent with those observed .",
    "therefore we do not need to introduce any evolution of the uv background in that range .",
    "for both the cdm and lcdm models considered here , matching the observed effective opacity in the ly@xmath8 forest requires an appropriate choice of @xmath299 .",
    "if we assume @xmath186 , a nominal value consistent with standard big bang nucleosynthesis , then both models require @xmath300 , somewhat lower than the value estimated for quasars at @xmath232 , and substantially lower than the estimate that @xmath233 from the proximity effect ( cooke et al .",
    "alternatively , if we adopt @xmath301 as estimated by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , then we require @xmath188 .",
    "this is at the high end of the range of values consistent with standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is , however , compatible with the value found recently by tytler , fan & burles ( 1996 ) from a measurement of a low deuterium abundance at high redshift .",
    "our results are obviously incompatible with the much lower value of @xmath36 deduced by rugers & hogan ( 1996 ) from a measurement of a high deuterium abundance .",
    "we have compared the ly-@xmath8 forest of hs 1700 + 64 with synthetic samples in the cdm and lcdm models using several statistical quantities which depend sensitively on spectral shapes .",
    "the @xmath28 parameter describes the temperature or the width of an individual line profile .",
    "the spectral filling factor represents the percentage of pixels with flux below a given limit .",
    "it is a useful quantity that can be measured in observations .",
    "a strong clustering in the igm would result in too small a filling factor to be accepted .",
    "the spectral autocorrelation coefficient reveals the correlation between flux at chosen separations .",
    "the most useful coefficients are within 10  and are dominated by the voigt profile and density wing .",
    "while our model could still be modified somewhat in detail , the global picture and physical explanation of the igm and the ly@xmath8 forest should be well described in the present calculation .",
    "there are several interesting subjects in the igm models .",
    "first , highly resolved keck spectra would allow us to study small scale structures in the igm , and to discriminate different cosmological parameters . beside the traditional voigt fitting",
    ", statistics like the spectral filling factor and the autocorrelation function would be easy to compute and even more clear in revealing other important absorption features , especially weak features .",
    "the ly@xmath8 forest is very useful in model diagnostic checking .",
    "for example , if the standard deviation @xmath104 of the igm is changed by a factor of 2 , such as in the @xmath82 cdm model and the cold - plus - hot dark matter model , the resulting absorption spectra are already inconsistent with observations and the models can probably be ruled out .",
    "second , the present igm model is able to explain the recent observations of the heii gunn - peterson effect with a reasonable heii to hi population ratio of 100 - 150",
    ". we will discuss this in detail in another paper ( davidsen et al .",
    "the heii absorption depends not only on the column density of a cloud but also on the cloud geometry because of different saturation in the curve - of - growth .",
    "the more extended the cloud is in space , the less saturation the absorption has . in the conventional ly@xmath8 cloud picture ,",
    "a cloud with @xmath239 @xmath13 column density is already saturated in the heii absorption . in the present model , because of extended spatial structures , most of such clouds still appear linear and thus make a dominant contribution in the heii opacity .",
    "finally , we note that if the ly@xmath8 forest originates from continuous density variation in the igm , one can in principle deconvolve the density field inversely from the forest .",
    "this will allow us to obtain very fine structures ( @xmath302mpc ) as well as large scale structures of the cosmic baryonic distribution at high redshifts for the first time .",
