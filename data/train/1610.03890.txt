    "in a recent article @xcite a model of inflation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite of the hybrid type @xcite has been studied with great detail . to show that it is posible within hybrid natural inflation ( hni ) @xcite to account for inflationary energy scales as small as the electroweak scale or as large as the grand unification scale",
    "two versions of the model have been constructed based on simple effective field theories .",
    "the resulting inflationary sector is described by the potential for the inflaton field @xmath3 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a positive constant less than one and @xmath10 is the scale of ( pseudo nambu - goldstone ) symmetry breaking . here",
    "the end of inflation is triggered by an independent sector waterfall field in a rapid phase transition .",
    "the potential eq.([pot ] ) is reminiscent of natural inflation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where @xmath9 is fine tuned to @xmath11 to have a vanishing cosmological constant . here",
    ", however , @xmath9 can take any positive value less than one and the scale @xmath10 is sub - planckian .",
    "once the waterfall field triggers the end of inflation the inflaton fast rolls to a global minimum with vanishing energy .",
    "hybrid natural inflation has also the interesting property that the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 turns out to be a non - monotonic function of the inflaton ( see fig.[fhni ] ) . as a consequence the scalar spectrum of density perturbations develops a _ minimum _ ( fig.[espectro ] ) for a value @xmath6 close to the inflection point @xmath12 of the potential . during observable inflation",
    "the spectrum is decreasing thus we can use this fact to determine ( within hni ) an upper bound for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 by fixing @xmath6 as the value of @xmath3 for which at least 8 e - folds of observable inflation have occurred starting from @xmath13 , at which observable perturbations are produced , some @xmath14 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "this minimum amount of inflation with decreasing spectrum gives the maximum possible value for @xmath2 and for the scale of inflation @xmath7 .",
    "the remaining @xmath15 e - folds of inflation would occur with an steepening spectrum thus care should be taken to not over - produce primordial black holes ( pbh ) .",
    "the article is organised as follows : in section [ slow ] we summarise the slow - roll parameters and observables of the model . in section",
    "[ upper ] relevant equations are displayed together with figures and a table giving the resulting values for the observable for a given pair @xmath16 . from the table",
    "we can read upper bounds for the scale of inflation @xmath7 and for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 .",
    "section [ lower ] determines lower bounds for the scale of inflation and tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "section [ low ] gives a brief discussion of primordial black hole constraints on inflation and a discussion of low scale inflation , concluding in section [ conclu ] .",
    "in slow - roll inflation , the spectral indices are given in terms of the slow - roll parameters of the model , which involve the potential @xmath17 and its derivatives ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath18primes denote derivatives with respect to the inflaton @xmath3 and @xmath19 is the reduced planck mass @xmath20 which we set @xmath21 in what follows",
    ". defining @xmath22 we find @xcite @xmath23 in the slow - roll approximation observables are given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes the running of the scalar index and @xmath26 the running of the running , in a self - explanatory notation .",
    "all the quantities with a subindex @xmath27 are evaluated at the scale @xmath28 , at which observable perturbations are produced , some @xmath14 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "the density perturbation at wave number @xmath29 is @xmath5 with amplitude at horizon crossing given by @xmath30 @xcite , the scale of inflation is @xmath7 with @xmath31 .",
    "the tensor power spectrum parameterised at first order in the sr parameters is @xmath32 it allows to define the tensor - to - scalar ratio as @xmath33 .",
    "using the equation for the spectral index eq.([ins ] ) at @xmath34 , defining @xmath35 and @xmath36 we find @xmath37 at @xmath38 eq.([spectral2 ] ) can be solved for @xmath39 @xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41 the first solution in the limit @xmath11 corresponds to _",
    "natural inflation_. however to avoid the possibility of large gravitational corrections to the potential we will concentrate on the case @xmath42 in this case the relevant solution is the second one denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "now and in what follows @xmath39 , given by @xmath44 corresponds to @xmath43 of eq.([solution2 ] ) .",
    "the number of e - folds from @xmath45 to the end of inflation at @xmath46 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 when @xmath50 , thus , in principle one can have very small @xmath2 ( see eq.([hnieps ] ) ) and very low - scale inflation ( low @xmath7 , see eq.([ia ] ) ) when @xmath9 gets close @xmath51 for any value of @xmath10 .",
    "one can solve for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath52 and @xmath53 by substituting eq.([ch ] ) in eq.([hnieps ] ) , the result is @xmath54 we see that the lower bound @xmath51 is obtained when @xmath55 ( consistent with @xmath49 ) and an upper bound for @xmath9 is given e.g. , by @xmath56 , the result is @xmath57 where according to @xcite @xmath58 .",
    "in hni @xcite the tensor - to - scalar ratio is given by @xmath59 ^ 2 } , \\label{tensor}\\ ] ] we see that @xmath55 at @xmath60 developing a maximum located at @xcite @xmath61 a plot of @xmath2 given by eq.([tensor ] ) is shown in fig.[fhni ] .",
    "the maximum value @xmath2 can take ( away from @xmath62 ) is therefore @xmath63 .",
    "this together with some other properties related with the non - monotonicity of the tensor - to - scalar ratio are studied in @xcite .",
    "the density perturbation for the hni potential can be written as @xmath64 which presents a minimum ( see fig.[espectro ] ) for @xmath6 given by @xmath65 we see that @xmath66 where @xmath4 corresponds to the inflection point of the potential .",
    "thus smaller values of @xmath9 take us closer to the inflection point of @xmath67    observations indicate that the spectrum is decreasing during at least some 8-efolds of observable inflation thus in what follows we determine an upper bound for @xmath2 by requiring that the spectrum be a decreasing function of @xmath3 for at least 8 e - folds and the field excursion @xmath68 be less than one .",
    "since the range for the inflaton is given by @xmath69 the requirement @xmath70 is readily satisfied for @xmath71 .",
    "thus , we provisionally take @xmath72 as the end of the first 8 e - folds of inflation , this will determine @xmath9 for a given @xmath10 as can be seen from the formula for 8 e - folds adapted from eq.([n ] ) @xmath73 we first study this formula analytically for small @xmath9 . for small @xmath9 the term @xmath72 is also small and negligible inside the @xmath74 thus , @xmath75 can be approximated by @xmath76 from where it follows that @xmath77 is approximately constant ( for numerical results we take @xmath78 thus @xmath79 ) @xmath80 thus if we lower the value of @xmath10 the parameter @xmath9 ( which is smaller than @xmath10 due to the slow - roll condition ) has to adjust itself such that @xmath77 remains essentially constant . eliminating @xmath10 with the help of eq.([constant ] ) and expanding for small @xmath9 we get @xmath81 which is very nearly constant .",
    "the expressions for the spectral indices are@xmath82 we see that also @xmath25 and @xmath26 are practically constant .",
    "numerical results are displayed in table [ table1 ] for five values of the symmetry breaking scale @xmath10 .",
    ".for a given @xmath10 we impose the condition that there are at least 8 e - folds of observable inflation with decreasing spectrum ( from @xmath13 to @xmath6 ) .",
    "this determines @xmath9 and the condition that the field excursion is less than one , guaranteed by @xmath83 , determines an upper value for the tensor - to - scalar ratio r. notice also the constant behaviour for the spectral indices as expected from eqs.([nskapp ] ) and ( [ nskkapp ] ) .",
    "the upper bound for the tensor - to - scalar index is given in the second row corresponding to @xmath84 and a scale of inflation @xmath85 .",
    "for numerical results we have taken @xmath78 thus @xmath86 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for small @xmath9 we can also see that the tensor - to - scalar ratio decreases with @xmath9 as follows @xmath87 and so becomes small for small @xmath9 . from eq.([ia ] ) we see that the scale of inflation decreases much more slowly than the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath88 .",
    "we can also establish lower bounds for @xmath7 and @xmath2 with the following line of arguments .",
    "the origin of the potential in eq.([pot ] ) can be traced to a symmetry breaking phenomenon occurring at some energy scale @xmath10 which gives rise to a ( massless ) goldstone boson .",
    "next , non - perturbative physics at some temperature @xmath89 might occur which provides a potential ( and a small mass ) to the originally massless boson to become the inflaton ( a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ) .",
    "thus the inflaton energy scale @xmath7 is bounded by the symmetry breaking scale , @xmath90 in the case under study we have imposed the condition that there are at least 8 e - folds of inflation when the spectrum decreases from @xmath13 to @xmath6 and we now exploit its consequences . from eq.([ia ] ) we can write @xmath7 in a very suggestive form @xmath91 where the density perturbation at horizon crossing is given by @xmath30 @xcite . as we have shown in section [ upper ] for small @xmath9 both @xmath92 and @xmath39",
    "are very nearly constants . with a negligible @xmath93 term in the denominator of eq.([delta ] ) we find that @xmath94 and there should be a point where @xmath95 .",
    "we denote this value by @xmath96 , solving @xmath97 from eq.([delta ] ) above @xmath98 compared with the numerical result @xmath99 from a calculation with the exact expressions . using this value for @xmath10 together with its upper value @xmath100 ( to get @xmath70 )",
    "we find that the scale of inflation @xmath7 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 are bounded as follows @xmath101 if we drop the condition of having a minimum of 8 e - folds of inflation with decreasing spectrum then these bounds are not found .",
    "the steepening of the scalar spectrum in hni ( fig.[espectro ] ) gives rise to a positive running allowing for the possibility of primordial black hole production during inflation @xcite , @xcite . in terms of the wave number",
    "@xmath29 the scalar power spectrum at first order in the sr parameters is given by @xmath102 due to the constraint coming from the possible over - production of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) at the end of inflation the taylor expansion of the power spectrum around its value at horizon crossing , @xmath103 is bounded by , . the next order term in the expansion of eq .",
    ", involving the parameter @xmath26 , is subdominant . ]",
    "@xmath104 = ( n_s- 1 ) n_h + \\frac{1}{2 } n_{sk } n_h^2\\leq 14,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) evolves from the initial value @xmath106 .",
    "this gives the bound @xmath107 .",
    "for the hni potential this constraint can be written as @xmath108 , \\label{pbh}\\ ] ] and can be easily satisfied for all table[table1 ] cases since here @xmath109 .",
    "low scales of inflation @xmath7 can be obtained when @xmath2 is very small since , from eq.([ia ] ) , @xmath110 . on the other hand , from eq.([hnieps ] ) we see that @xmath2 is small when @xmath39 is very close to 1 .",
    "this occurs for @xmath9 approaching the lower bound in eq.([a ] ) .",
    "notice that the parameters @xmath9 and the scale of symmetry breaking @xmath10 need not be very small to give small inflationary scales , instead they should be closely related by @xmath111 . in the absence of a mechanism which sets @xmath9",
    "close to @xmath112 this is fine tuning which is equivalent to starting inflation with @xmath13 very close to the origin . in any case",
    "the value of @xmath28 should exceed the quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath113 . from eqs.([hnieps ] ) and ( [ ia ] ) we get the small @xmath3 behaviour @xmath114 from where it follows that @xmath115",
    "an interesting characteristic of hybrid natural inflation is that the tensor - to - scalar ratio is a non - monotonic function of @xmath3 with the parameter @xmath116 developing a _",
    "maximum_. a consequence of this is that the scalar spectrum of density fluctuations develops a _",
    "minimum _ for some value @xmath6 of the inflaton .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is always larger than the the value of @xmath3 at the inflection point of the potential @xmath117 .",
    "since the scalar spectrum has been observed to be decreasing during some 8 e - folds of observable inflation we can determine , with the additional condition that the field excursion is less than one ( in planck units ) , upper bounds for the scale of inflation and for the tensor - to - scalar ratio by requiring 8 e - folds from the scale @xmath28 , at which observable perturbations are produced , to @xmath6 where the spectrum stops decreasing .",
    "the condition to have 8 e - folds of inflation with a decreasing spectrum allows to also determine a _ lower _ bound for the symmetry breaking scale @xmath10 and thus for the inflationary energy scale and the tensor - to - scalar index .",
