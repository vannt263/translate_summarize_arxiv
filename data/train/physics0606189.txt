    "chiral materials are of interest on their own : chiral materials belong to the larger class of bi - isotropic or , even more generally , bi - anisotropic materials @xcite .",
    "especially interesting in this context @xcite are materials whose electric susceptibility and magnetic permeability are both negative in a given frequency range .",
    "meta - materials for the use in the microwave region consisting of helical structures have been studied as promising candidates both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . for applications working in the visible range",
    ", one has to pass to a molecular level .",
    "there , quite different classes of molecules with helical structure show strong optical activity @xcite .    for the optimization of these properties , ab initio calculations are only of limited value as they do not show explicitly the dependence of the properties on the variables of the system .",
    "on the other hand many model systems @xcite have been devised whose optical activity can be calculated analytically as a function of their parameters .    in the following",
    ", we will be interested in modelling the optical activity of helical molecules .",
    "an especially simple model , which can be solved analytically , is the one - electron model for free motion on a helix as proposed by tinoco and woody @xcite .",
    "it was applied @xcite to describe the ord spectrum of hexahelicene @xcite , a helix shaped molecule built up of six annellated benzene rings .",
    "the model assumed a box shaped potential , which is zero inside the molecule and infinite outside .",
    "however , this implied degeneracy of all positions inside the molecule is questionable and instable with respect to perturbations .",
    "more recently , helicene derivatives like helicenebisquinones @xcite and tetrathiahelicenes @xcite have been shown to have very large second order non - linear responses making them interesting materials for non - linear optics . for these helicene derivatives ,",
    "the assumption of free motion along the helix can not be justified any more .",
    "maki and persoons @xcite instead have assumed that the electronic motion along the helix is controlled by an effective harmonic potential .",
    "this model probably is historically the first , it was proposed by paul drude @xcite in 1900 , to explain the phenomenon optical activity .",
    "astonishingly , it has never been treated quantum mechanically , probably because it was believed that the original classical model is optically inactive .",
    "we will show , however , that this holds true only at zero energy .",
    "drude considered the motion of a single classical charged particle with charge @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 constrained to move on a helical path so that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the radius of the helix and @xmath6 is the pitch ( cf .",
    "[ fig : spiral ] ) .",
    "the helix may be either right or left handed , depending on the sign of @xmath6 .",
    "the motion of the particle is governed by the harmonic hamiltonian @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the frequency .",
    "the canonical momentum @xmath9 is @xmath10 with the moment of inertia @xmath11 and the vector @xmath12 .",
    "the spiral considered by drude with radius @xmath5 and pitch @xmath6 . ]",
    "drude considered the forced motion of the charged particle under the influence of the external electric or magnetic fields of a polarized wave and calculated the resulting electric and magnetic polarization .",
    "he found a rotation of the plane of polarization . in the following",
    "it becomes important that drude considered forced oscillations , only , and did not take into account any free oscillations .",
    "hence , the unperturbed system is frozen in at its equilibrium position and has zero energy .",
    "this model was used extensively in the years following its proposal to describe optical rotation spectra although soon alternative many particle models , like the coupled oscillator model , were propagated @xcite . in 1933 , however , walther kuhn @xcite showed that the optical activity of the helix model was an artifact due to a physically unjustified assumption made by drude who took only into account the electric ( magnetic ) moment parallel to the axis induced by a magnetic ( electric ) field component parallel to the axis , while it neglected the electric ( magnetic ) moments perpendicular to the axis induced by a perpendicular magnetic ( electric ) field .",
    "we will speak in the following of the parallel and perpendicular component of optical activity .",
    "so , while drude only considered the parallel component of optical activity , kuhn showed that the parallel and perpendicular components of optical activities cancel in an isotropic ensemble in the regime of classical mechanics at zero energy .    some years afterwards , condon , altar and eyring @xcite presented an alternative quantum mechanical one - particle model which was optically active .",
    "however , they made no attempt to explain why the drude model did not show optical activity .",
    "they found that in the classical limit their model also shows optical activity , but failed to notice that this activity vanishes at zero energy , too , because it is proportional to the mean quadratic displacement from the equilibrium position of the particle .",
    "the drude model was then long forgotten until desobry and kabir @xcite showed in the seventies that the drude model exhibits optical activity in the nonlinear regime .",
    "however , they did not attempt to solve the drude model quantum mechanically , neither did they consider the behavior at finite energies .    for the related problem of free motion on a helix , tinoco and woody @xcite already established a non - vanishing optical activity in the quantum regime . while the latter model is formally very similar to the drude model , the two models behavior at low energies is quite distinct as the particle will become localized at the equilibrium position in the drude model while there is no equilibrium position in the case of free motion .",
    "the outline of this article is the following :    in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmdrude ] we will determine the quantum mechanical expression for the rotational strength of the drude model which determines both the optical rotatory power and the circular dichroism of the model .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] we will derive two expansions of the general result : in the first case , we will expand the optical activity into a series in @xmath13 at zero energy . in the second case ,",
    "we expand into a series in @xmath14 at @xmath15 , the classical limit .",
    "furthermore , the optical activity of an oriented sample of helices will be derived .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we will compare the optical activity of the drude model with that of the model of condon , altar , and eyring on the one hand and that of the model of free motion on a helix of tinoco and woody on the other .",
    "finally , a conclusion will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to determine the optical activity of the drude helix model we start from an expression for the rotation @xmath16 in radians per centimeter due to rosenfeld @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the rotational strength and @xmath19 are the eigen - frequencies of the system .",
    "the particle density is @xmath20 , the index of refraction is @xmath21 , while @xmath22 is a statistical weight . the operator of the electric and magnetic dipole moment , respectively , is @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the problem to determine of the optical activity thus reduces to the evaluation of the rotational strength @xmath25 .",
    "addition of an infinitesimal imaginary part @xmath26 to the frequency in expression [ eq : phiquant ] removes the singularities at @xmath27 and at the same time , the rotation @xmath16 acquires an imaginary part upon this substitution which can be shown to correspond to the circular dichroism of the transition from state @xmath28 to state @xmath29 . using the well known formula @xmath30 , where @xmath31 means the principal part , it is easy to show that the circular dichroism spectrum consists of lines centered at the frequencies @xmath32 .",
    "the position of a particle on a helix is described by only one parameter @xmath33 . while in classical mechanics it is straightforward to find the corresponding momentum @xmath34 , in quantum mechanics @xcite one has to specify much more carefully how the ( approximate ) restriction to the one - dimensional sub - manifold , in our case a helix , is achieved before the corresponding operators @xmath33 , @xmath34 and their commutation relations can be found .",
    "for the special case of the motion on a helix , there exists a very simple recipe @xcite for quantization : it can be shown that the operator @xmath34 fulfills a canonical commutation relation with @xmath33 , @xmath35=\\frac{\\hbar}{i}$ ] , whence @xmath36 so that the hamiltonian [ eq : hamilton ] is easily quantized .",
    "the position operator is formally identical to the classical expression , @xmath37 the cartesian momentum operator @xmath38 can be expressed by the time derivative of @xmath39 , @xmath40 . as the general expression for the time derivative of an operator @xmath41 depending only on @xmath33 but not on @xmath34 is @xmath42=1/2 \\{\\dot{\\phi},\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial \\phi } \\}$ ] , we may derive an explicit expression for @xmath38 and finally for the angular momentum operator @xmath43 .",
    "actually , it can be shown that in case of the drude model the operator @xmath44 itself may be expressed as the time derivative of an `` angle '' vector @xmath45 which depends on @xmath33 , only , @xmath46\\frac{m_e\\rho a}{2\\pi}$ ] . the explicit expression for @xmath45 being @xmath47 hence",

    "introducing the vector @xmath50 we may write the rotational strength in a more symmetrical form @xmath51 which is easily shown to hold true .",
    "this expression can be simplified further to give @xmath52    up to now , the form of the functions @xmath53 or the dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath29 and @xmath28 was not of relevance , whence we can use formula [ eq : rgeneral ] to calculate not only the optical activity of the drude model but also e.  g.  that for free motion on a helix with given winding number which should allow to reproduce the results of tinoco and woody @xcite . in case of the drude model",
    "the states of the system are characterized by the single quantum number @xmath28 so that @xmath54 .",
    "the appearing matrix elements are well known @xcite , @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath59 are laguerre polynomials , @xmath60 also , @xmath61 with the krneker symbol @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "finally , we find the following expression for the rotational strength of the drude model , @xmath66 exploiting the relation @xmath67 , the derivation with respect to @xmath68 may easily be carried out .",
    "we will now consider two limiting cases of that general expression .",
    "the first one is the classical limit .",
    "the second limit is the low energy limit in which only the ground state ( @xmath69 ) is occupied .",
    "the combined classical and @xmath70 limit was considered by drude and kuhn and it is interesting to explore why and how the optical activity tends to zero with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in the classical limit , the quantum number @xmath28 tends to infinity as @xmath13 tends to 0 while the energy @xmath14 is hold fixed .",
    "radiative transitions will only be observed between states with quantum numbers @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath71 is a small number .",
    "hence , @xmath72 tends to zero and energy becomes a continuous function of time @xmath73 to order @xmath74 .",
    "the classical motion will be periodic with period @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the observed transition frequencies will become multiples of this fundamental frequency , @xmath75 , as is well known from the correspondence principle @xcite .",
    "we will eliminate @xmath13 in favor of @xmath76 and @xmath14 from eq .",

    "to apply the last formula to our problem we write @xmath79 so that finally @xmath80    in the following , we will call @xmath25 alternatively @xmath81 .",
    "we are still not done in deriving the classical limit of eq .",
    "[ eq : phiquant ] as this equation contains a pre - factor @xmath82 . in the classical limit ,",

    "e.  g.  we may assume a micro - canonical distribution in which only states in a small energy range from @xmath14 to @xmath84 are occupied . for all @xmath85 in that range",
    "we have @xmath86 .",
    "if both states @xmath28 and @xmath29 are inside the interval @xmath87 then , as @xmath88 , the contribution of these states will cancel .",
    "trivially , if both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are outside the interval , @xmath89 , too . only the @xmath71 states with @xmath28 inside the interval and @xmath29 outside ( or vice versa ) will make a non - vanishing contribution so that @xmath90 whence the classical analog of the rosenfeld formula becomes @xmath91 this formula will not only hold true in case of the harmonic oscillator . in general , @xmath8 will then be a function of @xmath14 , too .",
    "expression [ eq : rclass ] depends on @xmath14 only in the combination @xmath92 , which is the mean quadratic fluctuation of the angle @xmath33 . for small values of @xmath14",
    ", we may use the taylor expansion of the bessel function to find the expansion of @xmath93 into a series in @xmath14 .",
    "the first non - vanishing term in that series is of order @xmath94 , @xmath95 correspondingly , there are three lines in the circular dichroism spectrum at @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .    in experiments ,",
    "probably the only distribution that may be realizable in an ensemble is the canonical distribution @xmath99 with @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the temperature . in the classical limit , where @xmath102 becomes continuous",
    ", the transition from the micro - canonical optical activity [ eq : phiclamicro ] to the canonical corresponds to a laplace transform which specializes to the replacement of @xmath103 in eq .",
    "[ eq : phiclamicro ] by @xmath104 .",
    "we see that the optical activity will thaw up proportional to @xmath105    the second interesting limiting case is that of zero energy when all the systems are in their ground states .",
    "the corresponding expression for the rotational strength @xmath106 is considerably simpler than the general expression [ eq : rquant ] , as @xmath107 . we may expand this result into a series in @xmath13 to find the lowest order correction to the classical optical activity from which we already know that it vanishes .",
    "we find that also the first order correction in @xmath13 vanishes , too .",
    "the second order result reads @xmath108 again , the circular dichroism spectrum will consist in lowest order of three lines centered at the fundamental frequency @xmath8 and its first and second harmonic .",
    "we may compare this result to the prediction that would arise if we would start like drude from the physically unjustified approximation of considering the parallel component of optical activity , @xmath109 , can be seen to be a sum of two terms , @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "hence , the optical rotation in the drude approximation is @xmath112 this expression for the optical activity does not depend on @xmath13 nor on @xmath14 , furthermore , the response of the system would always be linear for any strength of the driving field .",
    "we infer that at zero energy and in the linear and classical regime , the parallel and the perpendicular components of optical activities cancel .",
    "when the extension of the wavefunctions increases , either due to quantum effects , due to non - zero kinetic energy of the unperturbed system , or when the field strength is increased , the perpendicular response will become an - harmonic and a net optical rotation will arise .    kauzman @xcite noted that a two electron system in which the electrons are correlated so that their position @xmath33 differs always by @xmath113 will show a specific rotation as predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : phidrude ] .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that in this model the perpendicular responses of the two electrons mutually cancel .",
    "these considerations lead naturally to the consideration of the optical activity of an oriented sample of helices .",
    "a nice example of such a system which has been studied experimentally @xcite is a langmuir - blodgett film composed of supramolecular arrays of helicene derivatives .    as a sample of parallel oriented helices",
    "will be an uniaxial system , optical rotation will only be observed , if the propagation vector of light is parallel to the axis of the helices . in this case both the electric and magnetic field will be perpendicular to the propagation vector of light , so that one might expect that the optical activity is determined by the component @xmath114 .",
    "in fact , this is not entirely true , as there are also contributions @xcite which are due to interference of electric dipole transitions with electric quadrupole transitions so that @xmath115 here , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the @xmath118- and @xmath119-components , respectively , of the electric and magnetic dipole moment vector @xmath120 and @xmath121 while @xmath122 and @xmath123 are components of the tensor of the electric quadrupole moment . in the second line of eq .",
    "[ eq : rz ] we recognize the contribution @xmath114 , already defined .",
    "the additional contribution due to the quadrupole moments is easily calculated . as a final result we find @xmath124 on the other hand ,",
    "the absorption of the sample due to electric dipole transitions is proportional to @xmath125 with the oscillator strength @xmath126 .",
    "it is astonishing that e.  g.the circular dichroism and the absorption are directly proportional to each other with the proportionality constant being a measure of the chirality of the helices .",
    "furthermore , this result is independent of the potential seen by the charged particle , whence it holds both for the drude model and for the model of free motion on a helix",
    ". it would be interesting to test this prediction for the helicene systems mentioned above @xcite for which the classical drude model has already proven usefull for the calculation of the second - order optical response @xcite .",
    "we also note that the optical activity will not vanish for an oriented sample , not even in the classical limit at @xmath70 .",
    "we would like to compare the drude model with two other one - particle models for optical activity , the model of condon , altar , and eyring on the one hand side and the model of free motion on a helix with finite length on the other . as the quantum mechanical expression for arbitrary quantum numbers is complex on the one hand but lacks specific features on the other we will concentrate in our analysis on the classical and low energy limit .",
    "the model of condon , altar , and eyring assumes that the particle moves in a potential of the form @xmath127 with he @xmath128 are force constants and @xmath41 controls the strength of the cubic anharmonicity .",
    "condon et al .",
    "did solve this model quantum mechanically treating the cubic anharmonicity as a perturbation .",
    "they found that the optical activity of the system is proportional to the quadratic amplitudes of oscillation @xmath129 along the main axes of the unperturbed harmonic oscillator . in the classical limit",
    "these amplitudes will tend linearly to zero when the energy goes to zero . as any analytic potential",
    "may be expanded into a taylor series of the assumed form around the equilibrium position and as in the classical limit at small energies the motion of the particle will explore only a small region around the equilibrium position , the response of generic classical systems at low energies will be given by the result derived by condon et al .",
    "the vanishing of the optical activity as @xmath130 is easily understood as the amplitudes of oscillation @xmath131 are proportional to @xmath132 . at sufficiently small energies",
    "the motion of the particle will be nearly harmonic with the influence of the cubic anharmonicity , which is responsible for the optical activity , becoming less and less important as energy is lowered .",
    "this conclusion will not only hold true for isotropic samples but also for oriented systems as for quantum motion within a potential quadratic in cartesian co - ordinates , electric and magnetic dipole ( or electric quadrupole ) transitions are never allowed simultaneously between any two states .",
    "this line of argumentation clearly will not hold for the motion being restricted to the helical path as in the case of the drude model as the potential is not analytic .",
    "although in the drude model the motion along the helix is harmonic , electric and magnetic dipole transitions are possible at the same time between two given states as the co - ordinate @xmath33 does parameterize a curved path .    to understand the vanishing of the optical activity in the classical limit in case of the drude model we expand @xmath133 , which appears in eq .",
    "[ eq : rgeneral ] , into a taylor series . at zero energy",
    "we are left with matrix elements @xmath134 , whence to lowest order in @xmath13 we find @xmath135 cancel . as in case of the model of condon et al .",
    ", the vanishing of optical activity is due to the strong localization of the position of the particle in the classical low energy limit .",
    "we saw already in the preceeding section when discussing the original prediction of drude that an ensemble of oriented helices will show optical activity even in the classical zero - energy limit .",
    "furthermore , we remark that , as in the semiclassical low energy limit , the extension of the particle s wavefunction will always tend to zero , the use of the rosenfeld long wavelength approximation will automatically be justified.the free motion of a charged particle on a helix of finite extension is quite different in character from the two models just discussed , as , even in the combined classical and low energy limit , the particle will not become localized as a unique equilibrium position is lacking .",
    "hence , we expect that optical activity will not vanish in the classical limit at @xmath70 .",
    "the expression for the optical activity is more complicated than that of the drude model , as circular dichroism is not only to be expected at multiples of one frequency @xmath8 but at all frequencies @xmath136 with @xmath137 $ ] and @xmath138 .",
    "the rotatory power of this model was calculated by tinoco and woody @xcite .",
    "the energy corresponding to the level @xmath28 being @xmath139 , we obtain the classical limit substituting @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( again , @xmath142 ) with @xmath143 and dropping terms of higher order than @xmath74 . here , @xmath144 is the winding number of the helix .",
    "the resulting expression for the classical rotatory power is of the form @xmath145 . if we insert this into eq .",
    "[ eq : rclass2 ] we notice that the appearing combination @xmath146 is actually independent of @xmath14 .",
    "the only energy dependence enters through the frequency factor @xmath147 .",
    "hence , a change in energy will only scale the spectrum or , to put it differently , the optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra will be invariant if @xmath148 is measured in units of @xmath8 .",
    "the vanishing of the optical activity in the models of drude and condon et al .  is not paralleled by the model of free motion on a helix .",

    "the key result of this calculation is eq .",
    "[ eq : rquant ] .",
    "we found that the drude model is optical active in general , with exception of the classical limit at zero energy where the optical activity vanishes .",
    "incidentally , this was just the limit analyzed by drude @xcite and kuhn @xcite . to understand better the reason why optical activity vanishes in that limit , in sec.[sec : limits ] we found an expression for the classical optical activity as a function of @xmath14 ( eq .  [ eq : rclass2 ] ) .",
    "we found that optical activity thaws up like @xmath103 in the classical limit , a behavior that could have been predicted in principle already by drude or kuhn .",
    "similarly , an expansion of the general result in powers of @xmath13 for @xmath70 revealed that there are non - vanishing quantum corrections of order @xmath149 to the classical behavior .",
    "while in the general case , the circular dichroism spectrum will consist of lines at any multiple of the fundamental frequency @xmath8 , in both limits @xmath150 at @xmath15 and @xmath151 at @xmath70 , respectively , only lines at frequencies @xmath152 with @xmath153 $ ] will be observed in order @xmath103 and @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "we compared this result with the original ( and wrong ) prediction due to drude .",
    "he considered only part of the response of the helix to the external applied field , namely the components parallel to the axis of the helix , while neglecting the perpendicular component .",
    "we observed that the parallel component of optical activity is independent of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 and gives rise to a line in the circular dichroism spectrum at the fundamental frequency @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the perpendicular component is strongly dependent on @xmath14 and @xmath13 and will be anharmonic in general . only in the classical limit and at @xmath70 the parallel and perpendicular component of optical activity will be of like magnitude but opposite sign , so that the total optical activity vanishes .",
    "we also consider the possibility to study separately the contribution of these two components by taking into account an oriented sample of drude helices as to be found e.  g.  in langmuir blodgett films of helicene derivatives @xcite .",
    "these oriented samples form a bi - anisotropic system .",
    "the only case where optical rotation will be observed occurs when the light propagates parallel to the optical axis , which coincides with the axes of the helices .",
    "we predicted that the optical activity will not vanish in that case even in the classical limit at @xmath70 .",
    "instead , the optical activity will become proportional to the oscillator strength describing electric dipole transitions .",
    "thus we conclude that the vanishing of the isotropic optical activity in the classical limit at @xmath70 is due to a delicate balance between the individual optical activities for different orientations of the axes .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we compared the drude model with two other models describing one electron optical activity , namely the models of condon , altar , and eyring @xcite on the one hand and the model of tinoco and woody @xcite on the other . while all three models are optically active , they show qualitatively different behavior , especially in the combined classical and low energy limit . in that limit , the model of condon et al .",
    "is generical for systems of one electron moving in an analytical potential with unique equilibrium position .",
    "we found that the vanishing of optical activity in that limit is also due to the localization of the particle at the equilibrium position where it does not perceive the intrinsic chirality of the potential .",
    "however , as this model is truly three dimensional , the optical activity vanishes proportional to @xmath13 and @xmath14 while in the drude model , with its one - dimensional potential which is not an analytic function of @xmath39 , optical activity vanishes like @xmath149 and @xmath103 . finally , the model of tinoco and woody , which describes the free motion of a particle on a helix , is qualitatively different from the other two models considered as there is no designated equilibrium position .",

    "<S> an old classical one - particle helix model for optical activity , first proposed by drude , is reconsidered here . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum drude model is very instructive because the optical activity can be calculated analytically without further approximations apart from the rosenfeld long wavelength approximation . </S>",
    "<S> while it was generally believed that this model , when treated correctly , is optically inactive , we show that it leads to optical activity when the motion of the particle is quantum mechanically treated . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that optical activity arises even in the classical regime at non - zero energy , while for zero energy the model is inactive , in accordance with previous results . </S>",
    "<S> the model is compared with other one - electron models and it is shown that its predicted optical activity is qualitatively different from those of other one - electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing of optical activity in the classical zero - energy limit for the drude model is due to the localization of the particle at the equilibrium position , whereas in the analogous model of a particle moving freely on a helix without a definite equilibrium position , optical activity does not vanish but the spectrum is rescaled . </S>",
    "<S> the model under study leads to interesting predictions about the optical properties of e.  g.  helicene derivatives . </S>"
