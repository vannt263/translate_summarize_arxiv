    "during the last decade it has become apparent that lateral diffusion of various components of the cell along the membrane is crucial for several cellular processes , like exo- and endocytosis , cell signaling , or cell movement . to study all these different aspects of lateral diffusion in more detail a whole variety of experimental methods has been developed , including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap )  @xcite , single particle tracking ( spt )  @xcite , fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs )  @xcite , or pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance ( pfg - nmr )  @xcite . while the accuracy of measured diffusion coefficients achieved with these experimental methods can be very high  @xcite , the interpretation of the results is often very difficult .",
    "it is , therefore , likely that theoretical calculations and simulations in particular will play a key role in developing a better understanding of diffusive processes in biological membranes .    in order to correctly interpret experimental results",
    "it is necessary to analyze what information of the system in which diffusion takes place is documented but also what is neglected or insufficiently regarded during the measurement .",
    "lateral diffusion of proteins in a membrane must not be viewed as diffusion on a flat surface : due to the flexibility of biological membranes lateral diffusion always takes place on curved surfaces , whereby the shape of this surface may also be time dependent .",
    "this is an important aspect that needs to be taken into account in the experimental data analysis .",
    "however , this turns out to be rather difficult , because not always information on the membrane shape can be acquired .",
    "so far several theoretical studies of free diffusion on temporally fixed curved surfaces have been undertaken .",
    "one of the first studies of this kind was performed by aizenbud and gershon  @xcite who numerically solved the smoluchowski equation of free diffusion on a periodic surface . in later studies that include both sophisticated numerical and analytical calculations diffusion on more complicated surfaces",
    "is regarded  @xcite .",
    "recently schwartz et al .",
    "@xcite and sbalzarini et al .",
    "@xcite simulated free diffusion on surfaces reconstructed from experimental image data . in the latter work , that analyses diffusion in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , experimental frap curves are compared with simulation results",
    "good agreement is found , however , the authors point out that the evaluation of the frap curves assuming the membrane to be flat leads to diffusion coefficients that differ by a factor of about two from the actual intramembrane diffusion coefficient .",
    "furthermore , the experimentally determined diffusion coefficient appears anisotropic while real diffusion along the er is purely isotropic .",
    "these studies clearly show that the curvature of membranes may not be neglected during the evaluation of experimental data . but",
    "even if the shape of the membrane within the measurement volume appears flat on average , the actual shape fluctuates due to thermal activation .",
    "these membrane fluctuations have been thoroughly studied . while the fluctuation spectrum of a free and almost flat membrane is easily calculated  @xcite ,",
    "the influence of various geometric confinements of the membrane have also been regarded .",
    "these include the attachment of the membrane to a reference plane via a regular mesh of harmonic springs  @xcite which resembles a model for the attachment of the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton , a membrane that is close to a flat non - impenetrable surface  @xcite , or the inclusion of active proteins in the membrane , that exert an out - of - plane force on the membrane  @xcite .",
    "lin and brown introduced a very powerful method to simulate membrane fluctuations  @xcite , the fourier space brownian dynamics algorithm , that allows to add a whole variety of external influences on the membrane .",
    "part of the simulation algorithm introduced in this paper is closely related to this method .",
    "returning to the movement of proteins along the membrane , it is obvious that membrane fluctuations will influence the measured value of diffusion coefficients .",
    "this was first pointed out by gustafsson and halle  @xcite .",
    "but , although their work is almost ten years old , experimentally diffusion coefficients are still determined by use of the projected flat path particles perform instead of the real path along the membrane .",
    "only recently the quantitative influence of neglecting thermal membrane fluctuations on the measured diffusion coefficients has been estimated both by us and gov  @xcite . however , these calculations make use of a preaveraging approximation , that a priori implies that the time it takes a diffusing particle on average to diffuse the length @xmath0 should be much smaller than the correlation time of a membrane fluctuation mode with wave number @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we introduce a new algorithm that does not depend on this kind of approximation , because the diffusive motion of a protein along a fluctuating membrane is simulated explicitly .",
    "clearly , the system dynamics is described by two coupled processes : the fluctuations of the membrane and the diffusion of the particle . the simulation of membrane fluctuations is effectively regarded by numerically integrating the equation of motion for a membrane given in the monge gauge , discretely in time . at each discrete timestep we also update the position of the diffusing particle . to this",
    "end the discrete version of the langevin equation valid for the particle movement is used .",
    "special care needs to be taken regarding this langevin equation because the movement of the particle depends on the actual shape of the membrane .    as a first test",
    "we analyze the height - height correlation function of membrane fluctuations , and compare the simulation results with the analytical result .",
    "as mentioned above we have previously calculated the ratio of the measured , or projected , and the intramembrane diffusion coefficient as a function of membrane parameters within a preaveraging approximation .",
    "using our simulation scheme that does not rely on this kind of approximation we determine the same ratio of diffusion coefficients by analyzing the mean square displacement of diffusing particles .",
    "we compare the simulation results with the analytical results and finally discuss the applicability of the preaveraging approximation for situations when diffusive timescales are comparable or smaller than typical membrane time scales by analyzing relevant correlation functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : while we introduce the dynamics of membranes in the next section , we explain diffusion on a curved surface in sec .",
    "[ sec : diff_curve ] . generally diffusion can either be expressed by a fokker - planck equation that gives the dynamics of the probability of finding a particle at a certain time and position , or a langevin equation that corresponds to the equation of motion of the particle position . in secs .",
    "[ sec : smolouchovsky ] and  [ sec : langevin ] the smoluchowski equation , a particular form of the fokker - planck equation , and the langevin equation for diffusion on a curved surface expressed in the monge gauge are described , respectively . since",
    "simulation results are compared with previous calculations we briefly explain these in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] . after establishing the theoretical foundations necessary for this study",
    "we describe our simulation scheme in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] with which the results in sec .  [ sec : results ] are achieved . in the result section",
    "we first analyze pure membrane fluctuations and then determine the ratio of projected and intramembrane diffusion as a function of the membrane parameters bending rigidity and effective surface and as a function of the intramembrane diffusion coefficient .",
    "after the comparison of simulation results with analytical calculations we estimate the limits of the preaveraging approximation in sec .",

    "but so far only little complementing theoretical or simulational work has been performed in order to develop a broader understanding of experimental findings . in previous work",
