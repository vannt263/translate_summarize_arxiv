    "bosonic degrees of freedom arise generically and naturally in theories of fundamental physics , both in the standard model and beyond .",
    "the higgs boson is of paramount importance , being the only fundamental scalar in the standard model @xcite , but many other scalar degrees of freedom have been proposed to extend particle physics to high energy scales .",
    "these include ( among many others ) the axion of qcd @xcite or the scalar which drives the expansion of the universe in quintessence models @xcite .",
    "these bosonic particles often make good dark matter ( dm ) candidates as well .",
    "one reason for this is that unlike the higgs , many of these new scalars would be stable or long - lived enough that they could coalesce into dm halos which constitute the seeds of galaxy formation . unlike the usual collisionless cold dm picture",
    ", however , we are interested in the scenario where large collections of these bosons form bound states of macroscopic size due to their self - gravitation ( and self - interaction generically ) . for this picture to be consistent , the scalars are taken to be sufficiently cold so that they may coalesce into a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) state , and",
    "can thus be described by a single condensate wavefunction .",
    "these wavefunctions can indeed encompass an astrophysically large volume of space and have thus been termed `` boson stars '' @xcite .",
    "it was shown many years ago that objects of this type are allowed by the equations of motion , first by kaup @xcite and subsequently by ruffini and bonazzola @xcite in non - interacting systems .",
    "they found a maximum mass for boson stars of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 gev is the planck mass and @xmath2 is the mass of the individual bosons .",
    "( this is very different from the analogous limit for fermionic stars , termed the chandrasekhar limit , which scales as @xmath3 ) .",
    "later , it was shown by colpi et al .",
    "@xcite that self interactions in these systems can cause significant phenomenological changes .",
    "in particular , they examined systems with repulsive self - interactions , and show that the upper limit on the mass is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a dimensionless @xmath6 coupling . because the former is derived by rescaling the equations of motion and dropping higher - order terms in the strong coupling limit , as we see in section [ bosonsec ] . ] this extra factor of @xmath7 as compared to the noninteracting case makes it more plausible that boson stars can have masses even larger than a solar mass .",
    "a different method of constraining the boson star parameter space , which fits the coupling strength using data from galaxy and galaxy cluster sizes , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the situation for attractive self - interactions is slightly more complex .",
    "the simplest case involves a self - interaction of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 for attractive interactions .",
    "if this were the highest - order term in the potential , then it would not be bounded below , and so one typically stabilizes it by the addition of a positive @xmath10 term .",
    "we will assume that the contribution of such higher - order terms is negligible phenomenologically ( we address the validity of that assumption in section [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in this scenario the typical sizes of gravitationally bound bec states is significantly smaller than the repulsive or non - interacting cases .",
    "this is because the only force supporting the condensate against collapse comes from the uncertainty principle .",
    "gravity and attractive self - interactions tend to shrink the condensate .",
    "we will see in section [ bosonsec ] that the maximum mass for an attractive condensate scales as @xmath11 .",
    "this result was originally derived using an approximate analytical method @xcite , and was later confirmed by a precise numerical calculation @xcite .",
    "dm self - interactions have already been proposed and studied in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons why dm self - interactions can play an important role is due to the increasing tension between numerical simulations of collisionless cold dm and astrophysical observations , the resolution of which ( for the moment ) is unknown .",
    "the first discrepancy , known as the `` cusp - core problem '' , is related to the fact that dwarf galaxies are observed to have flat density profiles in their central regions @xcite , while n - body simulations predict cuspy profiles for collisionless dm @xcite .",
    "second , the number of satellite galaxies in the milkly way is far fewer than the number predicted in simulations @xcite .",
    "last is the so - called `` too big to fail '' problem : simulations predict dwarf galaxies in a mass range that we have not observed , but which are too large to have not yet produced stars @xcite .",
    "the solution of these problems is currently unknown , but a particularly well - motivated idea involves self - interacting dm ( sidm ) .",
    "simulations including such interactions suggest that they have the effect of smoothing out cuspy density profiles , and could solve the other problems of collisionless dm as well @xcite .",
    "these simulations prefer a self - interaction cross section of @xmath12 @xmath13/g @xmath14 @xmath13/g .",
    "there are , however , upper bounds on @xmath15 from a number of sources , including the preservation of ellipticity of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the allowed parameter space from these constraints nonetheless intersects the range of cross sections which can resolve the small - scale issues of collisionless dm , in the range @xmath12",
    "@xmath13/g @xmath16 @xmath13/g .",
    "self - gravitation and additionally extra self - interactions among dm particles can lead in some cases to the collapse of part of the dm population into formation of dark stars .",
    "the idea of dm forming star - like compact objects is not new .",
    "dark stars that consist of annihilating dm might have existed in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "dark stars have been also studied in the context of hybrid compact stars made of baryonic and dm  @xcite as well as in the context of mirror dm  @xcite . additionally some of the authors of the current paper studied the possibility of dark star formation from asymmetric fermionic dm that exhibits yukawa type self - interactions that can alleviate the problems of the collisionless cold dm paradigm  @xcite . unlike the dark stars of annihilating dm , asymmetric dark stars can be stable and observable today .",
    "@xcite displays the parameter space where it is possible to observe such dark stars , providing mass radius relations , corresponding chandrasekhar mass limits and density profiles .",
    "self - interactions in dark stars have also been considered in @xcite for fermionic particles , as well as in @xcite for bosonic ones .    in this paper",
    "we examine the dark stars composed of asymmetric self - interacting bosonic dm .",
    "the study is fundamentally different from that of  @xcite because unlike the case of fermionic dm where the stability of the star is achieved by equilibrium between the fermi pressure and gravitation , bosonic dm does not have a fermi surface .",
    "they form a bec in the ground state and it is the uncertainty principle that keeps the star from collapsing .",
    "we are going to demonstrate how dm self - interactions affect the mass radius relation , the density profile and the maximum mass of these dm bosonic stars in the context of the self - interactions that reconcile cold dm with the observational findings .",
    "note that we set @xmath17 in what follows .",
    "as we mentioned above , galactic scale @xmath18-body simulations of cold , non - interacting dm indicate that the central regions of galaxies should have a `` cuspy '' density profile , contrary to the cored profiles one observes .",
    "this , along with the `` missing satellites '' and `` too big to fail '' problems , has led some to question the non - interacting dm paradigm . while some believe that the inclusion of baryonic physics could alleviate these issues @xcite",
    ", it remains an open question . on the other hand",
    ", the inclusion of self - interactions in the dm sector could resolve these issues without creating tension with other astrophysical constraints .",
    "these two conditions can be simultaneously satisfied",
    "if the cross section per unit mass for dm satisfies @xmath19 assuming a velocity independent cross section , @xcite found that @xmath20 @xmath13/g tends to over - flatten dwarf galaxy cores and that it is marginally consistent with ellipticity constraints of the milky way . on the other hand a value of @xmath12 @xmath13/g",
    "satisfies all constraints and flattens dwarf galaxy cores sufficiently .",
    "let us consider a potential of the form @xmath21 note that @xmath22 ( @xmath9 ) signifies a repulsive ( attractive ) interaction .",
    "the resulting dm - dm scattering cross - section is @xmath23 at tree level . plugging this into eq .",
    "( [ csconstraint ] ) , we get the constraint @xmath24 this matches the results of @xcite . for perturbativity",
    ", we should restrict @xmath25 , which would imply that our results are valid only for @xmath26 mev . in this mass range",
    ", it is plausible that these dm particles coalese into boson stars at some point in early cosmology .",
    "if a large fraction of dm is contained inside boson stars , the derived parameter space may be significantly altered @xcite , since boson star - dm interactions and boson star self - interactions may become significant .",
    "we will however assume that boson stars are rather scarce and the dm self - interactions are dominated by dm - dm scattering .      to quantify how scarce boson stars have to be within this approximation , we assume that boson stars have a characteristic radius @xmath27 , mass @xmath28 and number density @xmath29 .",
    "the mass , number density and self - interaction cross section of free dm is taken to be @xmath2 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the mean free path a dm particle travels before hitting another dm particle or a boson star will be @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . scattering with boson stars has to be much rarer than with other free dm in our approximation . therefore we require @xmath34 .",
    "for the dm density we use the typical value of the solar system , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "these requirements lead to the following condition @xmath36 taking self - interactions to be that of eq .",

    "we obtain in the attractive scenario @xmath41 where au is an astronomical unit . the minimum mean distance between attractive boson stars",

    "the number density must satisfy @xmath44 the minimum mean distance between repulsive boson stars which leaves our approximation valid can at most be @xmath45 .",
    "an important property of light scalar particles that has been examined extensively in the literature @xcite is that large collections ( particle number @xmath46 ) can transition to a bec phase at relatively high temperature , as compared to terrestrial experiments with cold atoms .",
    "the critical temperature for condensate occurs when the de broglie wavelength is equal to the average interparticle distance , @xmath47^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath30 is the average number density of the particles and @xmath48 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "this implies a critical temperature for transition to the bec phase of the form @xmath49 in this paper , we will assume that all relevant scalar field particles are condensed , i.e. that the system is in its ground state , a perfect bec .",
    "the effect of thermal excitations is examined in @xcite and they are expected to be negligible as long as @xmath50 is satisfied .",

    "the maximum mass of these solutions was found to be @xmath52 , the oft - quoted kaup limit for non - interacting boson stars .",

    "sufficiently strong self - interactions can lead to the gravothermal collapse of part or the whole amount of dm to dark stars  @xcite . in this case , dm self - interactions can facilitate the formation of bosonic stars because dm particles get confined to deeper self - gravitating wells simply by expelling high energetic dm particles out of the core .",
    "as the core loses energy , the virial theorem dictates that the core shrinks and heats up the same time .",
    "this leads to further energy loss and thus to the gravothermal collapse .",
    "such a scenario could also explain why the black hole at the center of the galaxy is so heavy , since dm bosonic stars could provide the initial seed required for the further growth of the supermassive black hole  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that boson stars can coexist in equilibrium with black holes , as shown in @xcite .",
    "one should also notice that if the whole density of dm collapses to dark stars , one does not have to be within the narrow band of parameter space depicted in figures [ m_rep_plot ] and [ maxmass_att ] .",
    "another possibility is the creation of high dm density regions due to adiabatic contraction , caused by baryons  @xcite .",
    "moreover , bosonic dm particles can get trapped inside regular stars via dm - nucleon collisions .",
    "the dm population is inherited by subsequent white dwarfs that , in case of supernovae 1a explosions , can leave the bosonic matter intact , either alone or with some baryonic matter  @xcite .",
    "asymmetric bosonic dark stars where no substantial number of annihilations take place will not be very visible in the sky , although present .",
    "gravitational lensing could be one way to deduce the presence of such stars in the universe .",
    "additionally , if the dm boson interacts with the standard model particles via some portal ( e.g. kinetic mixing between a photon and a dark photon ) , thermal bremmstrahlung could potentially produce an observable amount of luminosity .",
    "this is particularly interesting since such a photon spectrum would probe directly the density profile of the boson star .",
    "bosonic stars could also disguise themselves as  odd \" neutron stars .",
    "for example , it is hard to explain sub - millisecond pulsars with typical neutron stars .",
    "xte j1739 - 285 could possibly be such a case , since it allegedly rotates with a frequency of 1122hz @xcite .",
    "compact enough bosonic stars would have no problem to explain such high rotational frequencies .",
    "another possibility is the observation of compact stars with masses higher than the maximum mass a neutron star can support",
    ". such might be the case of the so - called  black widow \" psr b1957 + 20 , with a mass of 2.4 solar masses  @xcite .",
    "therefore , abnormal neutron stars can well be the smoking gun for the existence of asymmetric dark stars either with fermionic constituents like  @xcite , or with the bosonic ones studied here .",
