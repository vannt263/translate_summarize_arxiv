    "as is well known , in renormalization schemes based on the method of minimal subtraction ( ms ) @xcite , including the modified ms ( @xmath4 ) scheme @xcite , which is routinely used in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite does not hold true in its nave sense .",
    "let us consider qcd with @xmath7 light quarks flavours @xmath8 and one heavy flavour @xmath5 .",
    "then , the contributions of @xmath5 to the green functions of the gluons and light quarks expressed in terms of the renormalized parameters of the full theory do not exhibit the expected @xmath9 suppression , where @xmath6 is the mass of @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath10 and @xmath11 functions governing the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath12 and the light - quark masses @xmath13 with the renormalization scale @xmath14 do not depend on any mass .",
    "the standard procedure to circumvent this problem is to render decoupling explicit by using the language of effective field theory , i.e.  @xmath5 is integrated out .",
    "specifically , one constructs an effective @xmath15-flavour theory by requiring consistency with the full @xmath16-flavour theory at the heavy - quark threshold @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this leads to nontrivial matching conditions between the couplings and light - quark masses of the two theories .",
    "although , @xmath18 and @xmath19 at leading ( tree - level ) and next - to - leading ( one - loop ) order , these identities do not generally hold at higher orders in the @xmath20 scheme . starting at next - to - next - to - leading ( two - loop ) order , they are broken by finite corrections , of @xmath21 , as was noticed in the pioneering works of refs .  @xcite .",
    "the relations between the couplings and light - quark masses of the full and effective theories are called decoupling relations ; the proportionality constants that appear in these relations are denoted decoupling constants , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this paper , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are computed through next - to - next - to - next - to - leading ( three - loop ) order , @xmath22 .",
    "they have to be applied whenever a flavour threshold is to be crossed .",
    "if the @xmath14 evolutions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are to be performed at @xmath25 loops , then consistency requires that the decoupling relations be implemented at @xmath26 loops .",
    "then , the residual @xmath14 dependence of physical observables will be of the @xmath27-loop order . if our new results are combined with the recently evaluated four - loop coefficients of the @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite functions , then it is possible to consistently describe qcd - related observables through @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the dominant subprocess for the production of the standard - model ( sm ) higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be the one via gluon fusion .",
    "therefore , an important ingredient for the higgs - boson search will be the effective coupling of the higgs boson to gluons , usually called @xmath29 .",
    "a standard approach to study this coupling as well as the higgs - boson coupling to photons has been to use low - energy theorems ( let s ) @xcite . at the two - loop level , @xmath29 has been known since long @xcite .",
    "recently , the three - loop correction to @xmath29 has been obtained through a direct diagrammatic calculation @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , also a let which allows for the computation of @xmath29 from the knowledge of @xmath2 has been used . in a similar way",

    "we extend our analysis to also include the interaction of the higgs boson with photons . in section  [ secdis ] , we explore the phenomenological significance of our results and present our conclusions . in appendix  [ appnc ] , we display the @xmath33 dependence of our key results , adopting the general gauge group su(@xmath33 ) . in appendix",
