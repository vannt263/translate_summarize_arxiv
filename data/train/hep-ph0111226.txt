    "the implementation of these higher order effects in monte carlo programs and the comparison with fixed order perturbative calculations remains an active area of investigation .",

    "the conclusions of these studies , however , typically rely on the use of the lowest order cross sections only.@xcite the nlo qcd results exist for all the relevant higgs production and decay channels , but not for many of the backgrounds .",
