    "we have developed over the last years a general strategy to calculate physical observables of compound systems in a nonperturbative framework  @xcite .",
    "this strategy is based on light - front dynamics ( lfd ) , a relativistic hamiltonian formalism advocated first by dirac in 1949  @xcite . in its original formulation",
    ", the state vector of any compound system evolves in the light - front time @xmath0 , instead of the usual time @xmath1 . since the physical vacuum in lfd is identical to the free vacuum ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , it is then natural to decompose the state vector of a compound system in fock components , since this decomposition does not include any vacuum fluctuations , but contains physical ( asymptotic ) states only .",
    "the problem of finding the state vector can thus be formulated as a @xmath2-body problem .    for obvious practical reasons , the fock decomposition should be truncated to a finite number of states ( fock sectors ) .",
    "this truncation should be strictly controled in order to be able to make reliable predictions for physical observables , order by order in the fock expansion .",
    "this is made possible due to two important breakthroughs :    * the formulation of lfd in a covariant way  @xcite , which enables the strict control of any violation of rotational invariance , when the fock space is truncated .",
    "this formulation , called covariant light - front dynamics ( clfd ) , has proven to be very powerful in the description of relativistic properties of few - body systems  @xcite . * the development of an appropriate renormalization procedure",
    " the so - called fock sector dependent renormalization ( fsdr ) scheme  which enables to calculate regularization scale invariant observables order by order in the fock expansion  @xcite .    in the simplest ,",
    "two - body , fock space truncation , our formalism is equivalent to summing the irreducible block  the fermion self - energy calculated in the second order of perturbation theory  to all orders in the chain approximation .",
    "this equivalence is caused by the fact that all the chain type contributions are restricted to the two - body fock sector .",
    "such a result is a direct consequence of our fsdr scheme and the corresponding renormalization conditions .",
    "the first nontrivial calculation corresponds to the three - body fock space truncation which incorporates , in the yukawa model for instance , fluctuations of the state vector involving one fermion ( @xmath3 ) , one fermion and one boson ( @xmath4 ) , one fermion and two bosons ( @xmath5 ) fock sectors .",
    "this calculation includes overlapping type ( divergent ) diagrams summed to all orders in the coupling constant .    within the fsdr framework , the first calculation of a physical observable  the anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) of a fermion in the yukawa model  has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the pauli - villars ( pv ) regularization scheme , as proposed in ref .",
    "the calculation has shown nice convergence of the results as a function of the regularization scale ( the pv boson mass in our calculation ) for values of the coupling constant @xmath6 of order of 0.2 . for stronger coupling ,",
    "@xmath7 , some dependence ( though rather weak ) of the amm on the pv boson mass was detected . while this range of the coupling constant values is not particularly small ( as compared for instance to the electromagnetic coupling constant )",
    ", it shows however that the truncation of the fock expansion was not completely under control .",
    "we detail in the present study an extension of our previous approach  @xcite , in order to control , order by order in the fock expansion , the regularization scale invariance of physical observables .",
    "our derivation is based on the full account of the renormalization conditions , using the fsdr scheme .",
    "we shall see that in the truncated fock space , the bare coupling constant and counterterms are no more true constants , but become naturally dependent on one of the kinematical variables , as already emphasized in ref .",
    "this dependence is determined unambiguously by the renormalization conditions and allows to restore rotational invariance broken by the truncation , as well as the independence of observables on the masses of the pv particles , when the latter ones are much larger than the physical masses . in ref .",
    "@xcite the fact that the bare coupling constant and counterterms are , _ a priori _ , functions of kinematical variables was not taken into account in full measure .",
    "the calculations were done for fixed values of the kinematical variables .",
    "the kinematical dependence of the bare coupling constant and counterterms is intimately linked to the fock space truncation .",
    "its explicit form is strongly affected by the fock space `` contents '' .",
    "thus , in the yukawa model considered in the three - body ( @xmath8 ) approximation , this dependence is quite sizeable .",
    "it is substantially reduced , when antifermion degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , namely , the additional three - body fock sector @xmath9 , are taken into account . in leading order of perturbation theory , we show that the inclusion of the antifermion d.o.f .",

    ", two important questions should be clarified , when using clfd .",
    "( _ i _ ) the explicit form of the relationship between the bare and physical parameters depends on the approximation used .",
    "for instance , in perturbation theory the bare parameters are polynomial functions of the physical coupling constant .",
    "the term with the maximal degree of the coupling constant is determined within a given order of perturbation , while those of lower degrees are taken unchanged from lower orders .",
    "this guarantees that calculated physical observables are regularization scale invariant in any order of the perturbative expansion . in our nonperturbative approach",
    "based on the truncated fock decomposition , an analogous requirement implies that the bare parameters should depend _ a priori _ on the fock sector in which they are considered @xcite .",
    "( _ ii _ ) in order to express the bare parameters through the physical ones , and vice versa , one should be able to calculate physical observables . in lfd",
    ", these ones can not depend on the choice of the orientation of the light - front plane .",
    "such a situation indeed takes place , for instance , order by order in perturbation theory , provided the regularization of divergences in lfd amplitudes is done in a rotationally invariant way  @xcite . in nonperturbative lfd calculations , which always imply fock space truncation , the dependence on the light - front plane orientation may survive even in calculated physical amplitudes .",
    "the identification of such amplitudes with observable quantities becomes therefore ambiguous .",
    "the use of our fsdr scheme in clfd allows us to answer both questions . in this scheme ,",
    "each of the original bare parameters has an additional index depending on the number of particles in the fock sector in which this bare parameter appears . in the yukawa model",
    "the fermion mass counterterm , @xmath65 , and the bare coupling constant @xmath66 , are thus extended each to a whole sequence :    [ fsdr ] @xmath67    with @xmath68 . by definition , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the quantities @xmath72 and @xmath73 are calculated by solving the systems of equations for the vertex functions in the @xmath74 , @xmath75 , ... approximations successively .    besides that , as we shall see in the next section , new counterterms which depend explicitly on the orientation of the light - front plane ( i.  e. on @xmath14 ) should be introduced in order to restore , if necessary , the rotational invariance broken by the truncation . in this case ,",
    "such counterterms are also mandatory in order to fulfil the renormalization condition .",
    "similarly to the `` traditional '' counterterms , they have fock sector dependence .",
    "the full set of rules for the calculation of the bare parameters can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the fsdr scheme is a general method to make nonperturbative calculations in truncated fock space .",
    "it can be easily applied to any physical system admitting particle counting .",
    "the yukawa model studied in the present work has been chosen as an illustration of the capabilities of our approach .",
    "once the bare coupling constant and the mass counterterms have been identified , one should fix them from a set of renormalization conditions . in perturbation theory , there are three types of quantities to determine : the mass counterterms and the bare coupling constant just mentioned , and the field strength renormalization constants . in the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme , the following conditions are used .",
    "the mass counterterms are fixed from the requirement that the two - point green s functions have a pole at the physical masses .",
    "the field normalization constants are fixed from the condition that the residues of the two - point green s functions at these poles equal @xmath76 .",
    "the bare coupling constant is determined by requiring that the on - mass - shell three - point green s function is given by the product of the physical coupling constant and the elementary vertex .",
    "the renormalization conditions in lfd are of slightly different form , although they rely on the same grounds .",
    "the mass counterterm for each physical state is fixed from the eigenstate equation  ( [ kt15 ] ) by demanding that the mass , @xmath18 , of the physical bound state be identical to the constituent mass @xmath77 .",
    "the bare coupling constant is determined by relating the on - energy - shell two - body vertex function @xmath78 to the physical coupling constant @xmath79 .",
    "finally , the normalization of the state vector is fixed from the condition  ( [ normep ] ) .    in order to set up the relationship between @xmath78 and the physical coupling constant",
    ", one needs to discuss carefully the renormalization factors of the external legs of the two - body vertex function  @xcite .",
    "these renormalization factors do also depend on the order of truncation of the fock space . in the yukawa model",
    ", this relationship reads @xmath80 eq .",
    "( [ gamma2r ] ) can be interpreted in simple physical terms .",
    "each leg of the two - body vertex function contributes for a different factor @xmath81 to the physical coupling constant , where @xmath82 is the field strength normalization factor .",
    "the initial fermion state is the physical state normalized to @xmath76 , so that @xmath83 in that case .",
    "the final boson line should be renormalized by a factor @xmath84 . in the approximation where fermion - antifermion loop contributions are not considered ( the so - called quenched approximation ) ,",
    "we have @xmath85",
    ". finally , the field strength normalization factor of the constituent fermion is just the weight of the one - body component in the norm of the physical state  @xcite , i.e. @xmath86 in that case , according to eq .",
    "( [ inor ] ) .",
    "following our fsdr scheme , the normalization factor of the final constituent fermion should correspond to the truncation of order @xmath87 of the fock space , since there is , by construction of the two - body vertex function , one extra boson in flight in the final state .    under the pv regularization ,",
    "pv particles are considered , in the interaction hamiltonian , on equal grounds with the physical ones .",
    "from here it follows that each constituent particle line in the two - body vertex may correspond to either a physical or a pv particle .",
    "observable amplitudes are described by diagrams with physical external legs only .",
    "for this reason , the renormalization condition  ( [ gamma2r ] ) should be imposed on the two - body vertex function with constituent lines corresponding to the physical fermion and boson .",
    "the condition  ( [ gamma2r ] ) has an important consequence : the two - body vertex function at @xmath88 should be independent of the orientation @xmath14 of the light - front plane . with the spin decomposition  ( [ g2 ] ) , this implies that the component @xmath64 at @xmath88 should be identically zero : @xmath89 if eq .",

    "( [ gamma2r ] ) , in the quenched approximation , turns into @xmath90 while the property  ( [ b2oms ] ) is automatically verified in the case of the two - body fock space truncation , provided one uses a rotationally invariant regularization scheme  @xcite , this is not guaranteed for higher order truncations . indeed , nothing prevents @xmath78 to be @xmath14-dependent , since it is an off - shell amplitude , but this dependence must completely disappear on the energy shell",
    ". it would be so if no fock space truncation has been done .",
    "the latter results in some @xmath14-dependence of @xmath78 even on the energy shell .",
    "this immediately makes the general renormalization condition  ( [ gamma2r ] ) ambiguous , since its right - hand side is @xmath14-independent .",

    "depend _ a priori _ on two kinematical variables . for practical purposes",
    ", we can take the usual longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath93 and the transverse ( with respect to the three - vector @xmath94 ) momentum @xmath95 .",

    "note that @xmath98 is a relativistic invariant .",
    "we have therefore @xmath99 .",
    "we denote by @xmath77 @xmath100 the constituent fermion ( boson ) mass . the on - shell condition @xmath101 can be used to fix one of the two variables , say @xmath102 , in the non - physical domain ( for @xmath103 ) : @xmath104 so that @xmath105 calculated in the truncated fock space depend on @xmath93 [ an example of a particular form of the function @xmath106 for @xmath75 is given in sec .

    "<S> we apply our approach to the calculation of the electromagnetic form factors of a fermion in the yukawa model , in the nontrivial three - body fock space truncation , for rather large values of the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , once the renormalization conditions are properly taken into account , the form factors do not depend on the regularization scale , when the latter is much larger than the physical masses . </S>",
    "<S> we then extend the fock space by including antifermion degrees of freedom . </S>"
