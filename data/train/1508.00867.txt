    "this paper is concerned with stochastic processes indexed by @xmath1 taking values in a finite alphabet @xmath2 , constructed from a _ transition kernel _ which depends on the whole past , i.e. a map @xmath3 $ ] such that , for any choice of @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a probability measure on @xmath2 . in the literature",
    "these models appear under various names , as _ chains with complete connections _",

    "@xcite or _ processes with long memory _ @xcite .",
    "two alternative ways to associate a @xmath2-valued stochastic process , i.e. a probability measure on @xmath6 , to a transition kernel are possible . the first deals with processes with a boundary condition .",
    "let @xmath7 be an arbitrary _ configuration _",
    ", i.e. an element of @xmath6 , possibly random , and let @xmath8 ; we say that @xmath9 is _ governed by the kernel _",

    "@xmath11 _ from the instant _",
    "@xmath12 , if @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for any @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear that , given the law of @xmath17 ( in particular if it is a deterministic sequence ) , the law of this process is uniquely defined . if for some strictly decreasing sequence @xmath18 , @xmath19 converges weakly in the product topology of @xmath6 , the limit is said to be an _",
    "infinite volume limit_. by weak compactness of the set of probability measures on a compact space , this set is non - empty : it reduces to a single element @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 converges weakly to @xmath20 , as @xmath22 , irrespectively of @xmath17 .",
    "infinite volume limits are mainly considered in the theory of multi - dimensional random fields @xcite . here",
    "we find convenient to borrow the standard usage in the multi - dimensional framework to introduce boundary conditions from an entire configuration on @xmath1 , rather than shifting to the left a configuration defined only on the half - line @xmath23 .",
    "the second construction , more often used in the one - dimensional _ time - directional _ context we are concerned with , is to declare directly a process @xmath24 , equivalently its law , to be _ compatible _ with @xmath10 if holds for any @xmath25 .",
    "this is analogous to the dobrushin - lanford - ruelle definition in the theory of multi - dimensional random fields @xcite .",
    "compatible laws are immediately seen to be infinite volume limits ; indeed if @xmath26 is compatible with @xmath10 and we choose it as a boundary condition , then @xmath27 has the same law of @xmath26 , for any @xmath8 : here we profit of having allowed random boundary conditions .",
    "conversely , since is equivalent to @xmath28 =   e [   p ( g |x_{n-1}^{r , \\mathbf{w } } , x_{n-2}^{r , \\mathbf{w } } ,      \\ldots )   h({x}^{r , \\mathbf{w}}_{n-1 } ,   \\ldots ,   { x}^{r , \\mathbf{w}}_{n - m }   ) ] , \\ ] ] for any positive integer @xmath29 and any real function @xmath30 defined on @xmath31 , this relation is maintained in the limit provided @xmath32 is continuous for any @xmath33 . in this paper",
    "only continuous kernels will be considered , therefore we will identify infinite volume limits with compatible laws , denoting their set with @xmath34 . in the proofs both characterizations of @xmath34 will be found useful .",
    "notice that elements of @xmath34 are not necessarily stationary , i.e. translation invariant , but from a non - stationary element of @xmath34 one can produce a stationary one by performing cesaro averages of shifts over a finite window increasing to @xmath1 .",
    "thus if @xmath34 reduces to a single element , it has to be stationary . on the contrary ,",
    "it is possible that @xmath35 but this set contains only one stationary element ; indeed we will present later a situation in which this happens .",
    "notice that , @xmath34 being convex , in case of non uniqueness @xmath34 has infinitely many elements .",
    "uniqueness conditions for general transition kernels of the form are scattered in the literature for various decades .",
    "some of these results refer to a dynamical systems setting , see e.g. @xcite . the use of techniques of a more probabilistic flavor , in particular _ coupling techniques _ , has increased in time , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite has started a constructive approach , focused to the design of _ perfect simulation schemes _ for the unique compatible measure . in a number of cases",
    "this has allowed to prove not only the uniqueness , but also the existence of a compatible law , when @xmath2 is countable .",
    "finally , multi - dimensional statistical mechanics techniques , such as the dobrushin criterion , have recently been used also in this setting @xcite . for perfect simulation in the multi - dimensional case the reader",
    "is addressed to e.g. @xcite ; also the continuity assumption can be relaxed , as in @xcite .",
    "the various sufficient conditions for uniqueness usually take a suitable positivity condition together with some regularity assumption on the kernel @xmath10 .",
    "the latter allows to control the behavior of the range of the functions @xmath36 on @xmath37 , for fixed @xmath33 and @xmath38 , as @xmath12 gets large .",
    "regularity assumptions of some sort are actually needed for uniqueness , as shown in @xcite , where an example of a positive transition kernel has been given with a strong  dependence on the remote past \" that gives rise to different infinite volume limits .    in order to motivate the class of kernels considered in the paper it is useful to recall the setting of @xcite . in this paper",
    "they write down a decomposition of a continuous kernel of the following form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a probability distribution on @xmath2 , @xmath41 is a probability distribution on the integers and for any @xmath42 @xmath43 $ ] is a transition kernel depending only on the @xmath44-th most recent values .",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays to zero fast enough they provide a perfect simulation algorithm for the unique compatible measure .",
    "the first assumption corresponds to positivity of @xmath32 , for some @xmath33 , whereas the second amounts again to a regularity assumption on the kernel @xmath10 .",
    "the mixture decomposition presented in @xcite is not unique .",
    "other decompositions have been proposed to prove uniqueness @xcite , leading to relax not only the regularity but also the positivity assumption in @xcite .    in the present paper we consider general transition kernels of the following form @xmath47 for some probability distribution @xmath48 supported by @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "is a stochastic matrix on @xmath2 , for any @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath52 , any kernel of the form is clearly continuous .",
    "a transition kernel of the above form will be called an _",
    "imitation kernel_.    when the @xmath50 s have the property that each row contains only a single positive entry , necessarily equal to @xmath53 ( as happens in particular for permutation matrices ) , the updating rule means @xmath54 with probability @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a function on @xmath2 obtained from @xmath50 .",
    "we refer to these cases as imitation kernels _ without noise_. otherwise we speak about imitation kernels _ with noise_. imitation kernels without noise are in some sense , to be clarified later , the most interesting to consider .    for general kernels of the form the value @xmath57 can be drawn in the following way .",
    "an integer @xmath58 is chosen at random according to the distribution @xmath48 , and the value of the boundary condition @xmath59 is read .",
    "then @xmath60 is drawn from the @xmath59-th row @xmath61 of the matrix @xmath62 . to perform this step , it is convenient to make reference to a sequence @xmath63 of _ coupling functions _",
    "\\to g$ ] , having the property that , for any @xmath42 , @xmath65 is distributed as @xmath66 whenever @xmath67 is a random variable uniformly distributed in @xmath68 $ ] , for @xmath33 .",
    "so , if @xmath69 is uniformly distributed in @xmath68 $ ] , @xmath70 yields @xmath57 .",
    "this updating rule can be iterated to produce the values of the process @xmath21 at all sites @xmath16 by drawing a random sample @xmath71 from @xmath48 and an independent random sample @xmath72 from the uniform distribution on @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "it is clear that for imitation kernels without noise , the @xmath73 s are not needed for the construction of @xmath21 .    rather than proceeding _ forward",
    "_ from the boundary sites , one can proceed _ backwards _ from any site of interest . in this case to produce the random variable @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , we have to follow the random walk @xmath76 @xmath77 with @xmath78 , whose distribution of decrements is @xmath48 .    let us define @xmath79 which are the minimum number of steps leading the random walk to land on a site below the _ threshold _ @xmath12 and the landing site , respectively .",
    "the information on the boundary condition @xmath80 is propagated forward by applying recursively the coupling functions in the following way @xmath81 starting from @xmath82 .",
    "thus , at the end of the recursion one has , for any @xmath83 @xmath84 for some suitably defined function @xmath85 .",
    "one can appreciate here that , if an additional zero order term @xmath86 , with @xmath45 and @xmath40 probability measure on @xmath2 , appears in the kernel , the @xmath87 s can also assume the value @xmath88 with probability @xmath89 .",
    "when this happens , one stops the random walk from going further in the past and reads directly the value at that site by sampling from @xmath40 . since this event will happen a.s .",
    ", uniqueness always holds in this case .",
    "incidentally , @xmath90 means @xmath91 , the dobrushin sufficient criterion for uniqueness for this kind of kernels .",
    "it is not difficult to realize that a zero order term _ can not be singled out _",
    "when each of the columns of @xmath50 has a zero entry , for all @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , this happens for imitation kernels without noise , except in the trivial case of some @xmath50 with all the rows equal to the same unit versor .    whenever for some pair of distinct sites @xmath92 , it happens that @xmath93 , for some positive integers @xmath30 and @xmath44 , we say that the two random walks started from the sites @xmath29 and @xmath94 _",
    "coalesce_. if this is the rightmost site in which this happens , we say that @xmath93 is the _ coalescence point _ of the two random walks . in this case one",
    "has @xmath95 , for any @xmath96 , hence for @xmath97 , it is @xmath98 . as a consequence",
    "the values @xmath99 and @xmath100 coincide , conveying all the information about the boundary condition @xmath11 needed to compute both @xmath101 and @xmath102 , by means of the functions @xmath103 and @xmath85 defined in .",
    "if the random walks @xmath104 , started from @xmath105 , with @xmath106 arbitrary finite subset of @xmath1 , coalesce a.s .",
    "we say that the distribution @xmath107 is _ coalescent_. in order to verify this property it is enough to check it for a window @xmath106 made by two adjacent sites of @xmath1 .",
    "if we let two particles perform two independent random walks started from these two sites , with the rule that it is always the rightmost that moves , the distance between the two particles is a markov chain on the integers , the so called von schelling process @xcite , up to coalescence .",
    "this is again a random walk with decrements following the law @xmath108 , but with a reflection around the origin once the negative half - line is hit .",
    "thus coalescence of @xmath48 means that from any @xmath109 the return of this process to the origin is almost sure ; this requires both some algebraic property for @xmath110 and a control of the tail behavior of the @xmath46 s , see @xcite .    back to imitation kernels , we mention that already in @xcite a particular class of binary kernels of the form was examined , in which @xmath50 took only the two possible values @xmath111 for @xmath112 , the so - called _ binary autoregressive kernels_. however the presence of a zero order term @xmath113 made the uniqueness problem trivial . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have considered binary autoregressive kernels with @xmath114 , equivalently with the @xmath50 s equal to either @xmath115 or @xmath116 , making a first step towards understanding the implications of the lack of positivity for imitation kernels .",
    "the main result of that paper is that for a coalescent @xmath48 uniqueness holds .    in the present paper",
    "the results are completely general , and not restricted to the binary case .",
    "the main result is that uniqueness for imitation kernels can be characterized completely in terms of the properties of what we call the _",
    "@xmath2-stochastic function _ induced by the imitation kernel , namely the mapping",
    "@xmath117 the necessary and sufficient conditions generalize the well known concepts of _ irreducibility _ and _ aperiodicity _ for a single stochastic matrix .",
    "irreducibility is discussed in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "since the presence of two irreducible classes implies the existence of two different compatible laws ( proposition [ addnonuniq ] ) and states not belonging to an irreducible class can not appear in the support of a compatible law ( proposition [ essentirred ] ) , we are allowed to focus our further study to irreducible kernels .",
    "aperiodicity is the subject of section [ sec3 ] . here",
    "a difference with the case of a single stochastic matrix appears : the states are constrained to have a period which is a multiple of the gcd @xmath118 of @xmath119 .",
    "but since any element of @xmath120 has independent marginals along the residual classes mod @xmath118 , the uniqueness problem is reduced to any of them , for which with an obvious rescaling @xmath121 .",
    "this is the content of proposition [ sottografo ] , which allows to correct a mistake occurred in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as it happens for finite markov chains , the presence of several periodic classes implies the existence of different _ non - stationary _ elements of @xmath120 , obtained one from the other by shifts ( theorem [ t2 ] ) .",
    "notice that this kind of _ phase transition _ is entirely different from the one in @xcite that concerns a positive kernel . at the end of the section we prove an important lemma relating the stationary elements of @xmath120 with the invariant distributions of the stochastic matrix @xmath122 .    in section [ princris ]",
    "we prove our main result ( theorem [ t1 ] ) , which is analogous to the ergodicity theorem for finite markov chains : uniqueness holds for irreducible and aperiodic imitation kernels .",
    "the unique invariant distribution @xmath123 of @xmath124 is identified as the single - site marginal of the unique compatible law .",
    "the fact that the tail behavior of the @xmath55 s does not enter in the uniqueness conditions entails that , by keeping @xmath110 fixed , but distributing enough mass to larger values of @xmath125 , we can construct examples of uniqueness in which any of the general sufficient conditions appeared in the literature fails . the uniqueness theorem appearing in @xcite",
    "is found as a particular case , without assuming coalescence ( theorem [ vecchionuovo ] ) .    in section [ perfect ]",
    "we propose two simulation algorithms of the cftp type @xcite , to construct the unique compatible law on any finite window of @xmath0 .",
    "the first , presented in theorem [ epsilone ] , works when the distribution @xmath108 is known to be coalescent .",
    "when @xmath126 is not coalescent or at least this is unknown , a threshold has to be specified , introducing an error in the algorithm . in theorem [ end ] we prove that the error introduced in this way can be made arbitrarily small pushing the threshold towards @xmath127 .",
    "for this reason we call it an @xmath128-perfect simulation algorithm . in a situation of non uniqueness ,",
    "the algorithms presented here can still be used to construct any stationary element of @xmath120 . in the irreducible but non - aperiodic case ,",
    "it can also be proved that there is only one stationary element .",
    "finally , in section [ basta ] we present a result for the case of countable @xmath2 . a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique element in @xmath34 , together with a perfect simulation algorithm is obtained . for finite @xmath2 , such a condition reduces to irreducibility and aperiodicity .",
    "the algorithm eliminates the approximation error for non - coalescent @xmath48 but it can be considerably more complicate for @xmath2 large or infinite .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of mappings defined on some @xmath129 with values in the set of stochastic matrices over the set @xmath2 .",
    "we call a mapping of this type a @xmath2-_stochastic function_.    recall that the free semigroup generated by @xmath130 is the set @xmath131 of finite @xmath94-tuples with elements in @xmath119 , for all positive integers @xmath94 , called _ words _ in the sequel .",
