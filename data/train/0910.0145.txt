    "the decay constants of pseudoscalar heavy mesons with @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks play an important role for studies of cp violation and in extracting the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements . experimentally , new data on the charm meson decay constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been reported @xcite .",
    "as the calculations of the decay constants are related to the wave function overlap of the quark and antiquark which are governed by the strong interaction , they therefore provide a crucial manner to compare different theoretical methods .",
    "in addition , the determination of @xmath22 remains beyond the reach of current experiments , thus the reliability of estimated @xmath23 by a theoretical approach is dependent on whether the determinations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 by this approach are consistent with the new data . during the last decade ,",
    "the decay constants of pseudoscalar heavy mesons have been studied in lattice simulations @xcite , in the qcd sum rules approach @xcite , and in the relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the electromagnetic ( em ) properties of hadrons is also an important topic , and the em form factors which are calculated using nonperturbative methods are the useful tool for this purpose .",
    "there have been numerous experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite of the em form factors of the light pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 )",
    ". however , the em form factors of heavy mesons ( which contain one heavy quark ) have much fewer studies @xcite than those of light ones .",
    "the present paper is devoted to an analysis of the wave function and decay constant by the hyperfine mass splitting of heavy mesons and the formulas of the decay constant and mean square radius within the light - front ( lf ) framework .",
    "we present the @xmath0 symmetry breaking effect in decay constants and electromagnetic properties of pseudoscalar heavy mesons .",
    "the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) is a promising analytic method for solving the nonperturbative problems of hadron physics @xcite , as well as offering many insights into the internal structures of bound states .",
    "the basic ingredient in lfqm is the relativistic hadron wave function which generalizes distribution amplitudes by including transverse momentum distributions and contains all the information of a hadron from its constituents .",
    "the hadronic quantities are represented by the overlap of wave functions and can be derived in principle .",
    "the light - front wave function is manifestly a lorentz invariant , expressed in terms of internal momentum fraction variables which are independent of the total hadron momentum .",
    "moreover , the fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and center - of - mass motion can be carried out using the so - called melosh rotation @xcite .",
    "this treatment has been successfully applied to calculate phenomenologically many important meson decay constants and hadronic form factors @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii the formulism of lfqm is reviewed briefly , and the formulae of decay constant and mean square radius are derived . in sec .",

    "the decay constant @xmath26 for a pseudoscalar meson is defined by a matrix element of the axial vector current between the vacuum and the meson bound state : 0 ||q_1 _ _ 5 q_2 | p(p)=if_p p_.

    "if we consider the potential of a hyperfine interaction inside the meson to @xmath30 : v_hf=+ ^3(r ) , [ hf ] where @xmath31 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath32 are the spins ( masses ) of the constituent quark . for the @xmath33-wave meson , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ hf ] ) has no contribution and the second term can distinguish the pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "therefore , the hyperfine mass splitting is obtained as m_pv = |(0)|^2 .",
    "[ deltam ] by combining eqs .",
    "( [ nr ] ) and ( [ deltam ] ) and canceling @xmath27 , we obtain : f_p=()^1/2 .",
    "if we suppose the strong coupling constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then the ratios of the decay constants can be obtained as =( ) ^1/2 , =( ) ^1/2,[ratiof ] where @xmath6 . from eq .",
    "( [ ratiof ] ) , we find that the ratios are dependent on the ratio of light quark masses @xmath10 and are independent of heavy quark masses . furthermore , by canceling the ratio @xmath10 , we have a relation which does not contain any parameter in the nonrelativistic approximation : =( ) ^1/2 .",
    "[ noparameter ] if one wants to include the relativistic correction to the ratios of the decay constants , not only the values of @xmath5 , but also the form of wave function @xmath36 must be known .",
    "let us come back to eq .",

    "the deviation of eq .",
    "( [ nr ] ) uses the fourier transform ( ) = e^i ( ) , where @xmath37 is the wave function in the momentum space . if the fourier transform is evaluated for the positive - energy projection of the bethe - salpeter wave function at equal ",

    "however , at the present time , how to solve the bound state equation is still unknown .",
    "alternatively , we come back to the still - unknown wave function @xmath43 and express it as a linear combination of the arbitrary known functions which form a complete set .",
    "of course , the complete set is not unique .",
    "here we give two examples for comparison .",
    "one is the solution of @xmath44 potential @xcite : _ nlm^c()=()^3/2",

    ". then the exact solution can be expressed as ( ) = _ nlm^a^c(g)_nlm_nlm^c(g)(),[combine ] where @xmath49 .",
    "this way seems very clumsy because , apart from @xmath7 , it also introduces a series of undetermined coefficients , @xmath50 .",
    "the following considerations , however , improve the situation .",
    "first , only the coefficients @xmath51 survive because we just studied the @xmath33-wave meson .",
    "second , we substitute eq .",

    "it is worth noting that the square bracket in eq .",
    "( [ reduce ] ) is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "then , the ratio of hyperfine mass splittings can be reduced as : = ( ) ^3 , = ( ) ^3 , [ splitting ] which does not include any coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "equation ( [ splitting ] ) is also suitable to the coulomb case .",
    "in fact , due to the @xmath52 function in eq .",
    "( [ hf ] ) having the dimension of an energy cube and @xmath53 is vanishing here , eq .",
    "( [ splitting ] ) holds for any wave function which contains only one hadronic parameter @xmath7 .",
