    "pg1159 are hot and luminous stars that belong to the class of hydrogen  deficient post  asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "these stars are supposed to be the main progenitors of hydrogen ",
    "deficient white dwarfs , which account for @xmath1 of the whole white dwarf population ( eisenstein et al .",
    "currently , about 40 stars are members of the pg1159 spectroscopic family ( werner & herwig 2006 ) , which spans a wide range of surface gravities  @xmath2 ( in cgs units )  and effective temperatures  75,000 k @xmath3 200,000 k. pg1159 stars are thought to be formed as a result of a born  again episode , that is , a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) experienced by a hot white dwarf during its early cooling phase  see schnberner ( 1979 ) and iben et al .",
    "( 1983 ) for early references  or a late thermal pulse that occurs during the post  agb evolution when h burning is still active ( bl \" ocker 2001 ) . during the vltp , the helium flash  driven convection zone reaches the hydrogen  rich envelope of the star and ,",
    "consequently , most of the hydrogen is burnt .",
    "the star is then forced to evolve rapidly back to the agb and finally as the central star of a planetary nebula at high @xmath4 values .",
    "a striking feature characterizing pg1159 stars is their peculiar surface chemical composition .",
    "spectroscopic analyses have revealed that most pg1159 stars exhibit helium , carbon and oxygen  rich surface abundances .",
    "the typical surface mass abundances of pg1159 stars are @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , though notable variations are found from star to star ( dreizler & heber 1998 ; werner 2001 ) .",
    "the variety of surface patterns observed in pg1159 stars poses indeed a challenge to the theory of stellar evolution .",
    "in particular , the appreciable abundance of oxygen in the atmospheres of these stars has been successfully explained by herwig et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the basis of evolutionary calculations of the born  again scenario that incorporate convective overshoot .",
    "interest in pg1159 stars is also motivated by the fact that more than ten of them , the so  called dovs , exhibit multiperiodic luminosity variations , attributable to global non  radial @xmath8mode pulsations , a fact that has attracted much attention  see , for instance , gautschy et al .",
    "2005 ; crsico et al . 2006 .",
    "recently , considerable observational effort has been devoted to the study of some pulsating pg1159 stars .",
    "in particular , vauclair et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have presented asteroseismological results for on the basis of a multisite photometric campaign .",
    "more recently , fu et al . ( 2007 ) have detected a total of 23 frequencies in and costa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have enlarged to 198 the total number of pulsation modes in  the prototype of the class  making it the star with the largest number of modes detected besides the sun .",
    "parallel to these observational breakthroughs , substantial progress in the theoretical modeling of pg1159 stars has been possible ( herwig et al . 1999 ; althaus et al . 2005 ; lawlor & macdonald 2006 ) . in this sense , the full set of pg1159 evolutionary models developed by miller bertolami & althaus ( 2006 ) has proved to be valuable for deriving structural parameters of pulsating pg1159 on the basis of individual period fits  see crsico et al .",
    "( 2007a ) and crsico et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , respectively , for an application to the hot pulsating star and to the coolest member of the class , .",
    "these evolutionary models are derived from the complete evolutionary history of progenitor stars with different stellar masses and an elaborate treatment of the mixing and extra  mixing processes during the violent hydrogen burning episode that occurs during the born  again phase .",
    "the success of these models at explaining both the spread in the surface chemical compositions observed in pg1159 stars and the location of the dov instability strip in the @xmath9 plane ( crsico et al .",
    "2006 ) renders reliability to the inferences drawn from individual pulsating pg1159 stars .",
    "however , except for , the stellar masses derived from individual period fits differ considerably from the masses obtained using spectroscopic data  although the spectroscopic uncertainty ( @xmath10 ) is large .",
    "this is noteworthy in the case of , for which the asteroseismological mass is about 25% smaller than the spectroscopic value ( crsico et al .",
    "this discrepancy could be indicative of a missing piece of physics in the existing pg1159 evolutionary models , a suspicion that becomes more solid in light of the detailed seismological study of the pulsating star recently presented by crsico et al .",
    "indeed , the best ",
    "fit model derived by these authors for is located outside the predicted dipole instablity strip .",
    "also , the best ",
    "fit model fails to predict a mixture of positive and negative rates of change of the periods ( @xmath11 ) as recently reported by costa & kepler ( 2008 ) in .",
    "but most importantly , the best ",
    "fit model and the evolutionary models of miller bertolami & althaus ( 2006 )  and of other authors as well  do not predict the large magnitude of the rates of period change observed in ( costa et al .",
    "this is a well known shortcoming  see kawaler & bradley ( 1994 ) and crsico et al .",
    "( 2008 )  of the standard evolutionary models of pg1159 stars which predict theoretical @xmath11 values about one order of magnitude smaller than those observationally derived .",
    "we present here solid evidence that pg1159 stars could be characterized by subtantially thinner helium  rich envelopes than traditionally accepted from the standard theory of the formation and evolution of pg1159 stars ( herwig 1999 ; miller bertolami & althaus 2006 ) that predicts that post  born again remnants are expected to retain thick he envelopes .",
    "for instance , the mass of the he envelope for the @xmath12 sequence of miller bertolami & althaus ( 2006 ) after emerging from the born  again episode amounts to @xmath13 .",
    "the possibility that pg1159 stars could harbour thinner he envelopes is sustained by the fact that v4334 sgr ( sakurai s object ) , a star emerging from a born  again episode , is displaying very strong mass  loss episodes as it is rapidly reheating ( van hoof et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this letter",
    "we compute full evolutionary sequences for post  born again stars under the assumption that such mass  loss episodes reduce the mass of the he envelope considerably .",
    "we find that pg1159 evolutionary sequences with thin he envelopes evolve much faster than the standard ones . on the basis of detailed pulsation calculations",
    ", we find that pg1159 models with thin he envelopes predict rates of period change which are in excellent agreement with observations in the case of ( costa & kepler 2008 ) , thus solving the longstanding discrepancy between the observed and theoretical rate of period change in this star .",
    "for the purpose of this letter we have calculated full evolutionary sequences appropriate for pg1159 stars that were evolved directly from the born  again phase .",
    "the calculations have been done with the lpcode evolutionary code that computes the formation and evolution of white dwarf stars through late thermal pulses ( althaus et al .",
    "2005 ) on the basis of a detailed description of the physical processes involved in the calculation of the violent hydrogen ",
    "burning event during the born ",
    "again stage , particularly diffusive overshooting and non  instantaneous mixing .",
    "this code has been employed to derive a full set of pg1159 evolutionary sequences starting from zams progenitors with initial mass ranging from 1.0 to @xmath14 ( miller bertolami & althaus 2006 ) .",
    "all of the sequences have been followed from the zams through the thermally  pulsing phase on the agb and finally to the born ",
    "again stage where the remaining hydrogen of the remnants is burnt .    as recently discussed in miller bertolami & althaus ( 2007a ) the born  again models of miller bertolami & althaus ( 2006 ) hint at a consistent picture with the observed behavior of sakurai s object , particularly its extremely fast post  vltp evolution . in addition , very strong mass  loss episodes during the sakurai stage appears to be a necessary ingredient in the evolutionary calculations ( miller bertolami & althaus 2007b ) to bring the evolutionary timescales into agreement with the short reheating timescale of the sakurai s object after its maximum brightness reported by van hoof ( 2007 ) .",
    "remarkably , strong mass  loss episodes have recently been reported by van hoof et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who suggested that the mass ejected by sakurai s object in the vltp could be as high as @xmath15 . in this letter",
    ", we will concentrate on the consequences of such mass  loss events for the subsequent evolution of the born  again remnants during the pg1159 stage . to this end",
    ", we have considered a rather extreme situation , but still reasonably , consistent with the results of van hoof et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , in which a large fraction of the remaining he envelope is lost as a consequence of mass  loss episodes once the hydrogen ",
    "deficient star is back to the agb .",
    "specifically , we have concentrated on the @xmath16 post ",
    "vltp sequence of miller bertolami & althaus ( 2007a ) , which after the vltp is characterized by a he envelope of @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the star loses @xmath18 as a result of mass  loss episodes .",
    "hereinafter , this sequence will be referred to as the thin he ",
    "envelope sequence .",
    "this allows the study pg1159 evolutionary model sequences with structurally different envelopes from those predicted by the standard theory of stellar evolution for post  born again stars .",
    "the most important consequence of the strong envelope reduction caused by mass  loss episodes during the sakurai stage is that the helium shell burning becomes virtually extinct .",
    "the remnant is left with no available nuclear sources and , as a result , its evolution through the low ",
    "gravity pg1159 regime proceeds on a much shorter timescale than in the standard pg1159 sequences in which helium burning mostly contributes to the surface luminosity of the models .",
    "the marked reduction in the evolutionary timescales characterizing the models with thin he envelopes is expected to yield large rates of period change in low  gravity pulsating pg1159 stars , which is a feature needed to explain the large @xmath19 measured in itself . for a quantitative inference of the possible impact ,",
    "we have computed @xmath20 @xmath8modes adiabatic pulsation periods for our pg1159 models using the pulsation code described in crsico & althaus ( 2006 ) .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on models belonging to our sequences with thin and thick he envelopes characterized by effective temperatures and surface gravities around the spectroscopically  determined values for .         plane for different stellar masses  thin black lines  and the 0.535 and @xmath21 pg1159 model sequences characterized by thin he  rich envelopes described in this paper  thick blue lines .",
    "note that these sequences have substantially smaller surface gravities than their thick he  rich counterparts , particularly for the low  gravity regime .",
    "the available observational data for selected pg 1159 stars are also included .",
    "spectroscopic uncertainties are within 0.5 dex for the gravity and between 10 and 15% for the effective temperature .",
    "see the online version of the journal for a color version of this figure . ]    in fig .",
    "[ pdot ] , which summarizes the main result of this work , we show the rate of period change @xmath22 for periods in the range @xmath23 s. the results corresponding to pg1159 models with thin ( thick ) he envelopes are shown with solid ( dashed ) lines and symbols . the model with thin he envelope",
    "is characterized by a stellar mass of @xmath24 , a he envelope of @xmath25 , @xmath26 k , log l/@xmath27 , and log @xmath28 . in both models , modes trapped in the outer envelope are characterized by negative rates of period change .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the values of @xmath22 of the model with a thin he envelope far exceed those predicted by the model with a thick he envelope .",
    "this is a consequence of the much shorter evolutionary timescale of the model with a thin he envelope during the low  gravity pg1159 regime . indeed , for untrapped modes ( @xmath29 ) the rates can be up to an order of magnitude larger in the case in which a thin he envelope is adopted , and even larger for trapped modes ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "on the contrary , for the regime of the evolved pulsating pg1159 stars of high gravity such as , already on the hot white dwarf cooling track , where helium shell burning is no longer the luminosity source in the standard models , the magnitude of the period changes becomes much less sensitive to the thickness of the helium envelope , as noted earlier by kawaler & bradley ( 1994 ) . in fig .",
    "[ pdot ] we also include the observed rates of period change in ( costa & kepler 2008 ) , which are displayed as open squares .",
    "note that exhibits a mixture of positive and negative rates of large amplitude ( up to @xmath31 s / s ) .",
    "the general agreement between the @xmath22 values predicted by the model with a thin he  rich envelope and those observed in is remarkable .",
    "note in particular that the rate of period change [ @xmath32 s / s ] of the 517.1 s mode  the central peak of one of the highest amplitude modes  is well reproduced by the model with a thin he  rich envelope , in sharp contrast with the predictions of the standard model with a thick envelope , for which the values of @xmath22 remain smaller than @xmath33 s / s for the relevant range of periods . from these results , it is clear that the presence of a thin he  rich envelope in appears to be a key ingredient to resolve the longstanding order  of  magnitude discrepancy between the predictions of standard pg1159 evolutionary models and the observed rates of period change in .",
    "we want to mention that the effective temperature of our model with thin he envelope is somewhat larger than the spectroscopically inferred value for .",
    "however , this inconsistency does not affect the main conclusion of this letter about the strong impact of thin he envelopes on the predicted rate of period changes in this pulsating pg1159 star .",
    "more precise asteroseismological fits to the observed period and period changes in with sequences with thin he envelopes would require the computation of a much finner grid of evolutionary sequences , an issue that would carry us beyond the scope of the present letter .",
    "another implication of pg1159 stars having thin he  rich envelopes concerns their location in the @xmath34 plane .",
    "in fact , the evolutionary tracks in this plane are strongly modified if the mass of the he  rich envelope is reduced .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ grave ] where the standard evolutionary sequences of miller bertolami & althaus ( 2006 )  thin lines  are shown together with two sequences of masses 0.535 and @xmath35 computed with thin he  rich envelopes ( solid blue lines ) , characterized by envelopes of 0.012 and @xmath36 , respectively ( as compared with the envelope mass of the standard models of 0.032 and 0.02 @xmath37 ) .",
    "note that for the low - gravity regime , tracks characterized by thin he  rich envolpes are hotter than their thick he  rich counterparts .",
    "that is , at a given effective temperature , thin he ",
    "rich sequences are characterized by markedly smaller gravities than the sequences with thick envelopes .",
    "this will certainly affect the spectroscopic mass determinations .",
    "this is a relevant issue concerning the hottest known pulsating pg1159 star , , a low ",
    "star for which the spectroscopic mass  about @xmath38 ( miller bertolami & althaus 2006 )  is much larger than the seismological mass of @xmath39 ( vauclair et al .",
    "2002 ; crsico et al .",
    "note that the models with thin envelopes predict for a spectroscopic mass of about @xmath40 , considerably smaller than that derived from thick he - rich models .",
    "hence , pg1159 sequences with thin he  rich envelopes may help to alleviate the discrepancy between the spectroscopic and seismic mass of .",
    "in this letter we have presented evidence that pg1159 stars  or at least itself  could harbour he  rich envelopes thinner than those predicted previously . the existence of pg1159 stars with thin he  rich envelopes is in line with the reported strong mass  loss episodes in the sakurai s object ( van hoof et el .",
    "2007 ) , an emerging post  born again star that is expected to evolve to the pg1159 domain .",
    "specifically , we have shown that if the pg1159 progenitors emerge from their born  again episode with considerably reduced envelopes , then the predicted rates of period change in low  gravity pulsating pg1159 stars",
    "are profoundly altered to such an extent that the longstanding discrepancy with the rate of period change measured in is solved .",
    "this result opens the possibility that pg1159 stars in general could be characterized by thinner he  rich envelopes than traditionally accepted on the basis of the standard theory of post  agb evolution . pushing our results to their limits ,",
    "we are tempted to speculate that the helium deficiency observed in h1504 + 65 , the most massive known pg1159 star , could be the result of stronger mass  loss episodes than those observed in sakurai s object , which combined with the smaller helium content that remains in massive post ",
    "vltp stars , could lead to pg1159 remnants almost devoided of helium .",
    "the existence of pg1159 stars with thin helium envelopes , is particularly interesting in view of the suggestion of an evolutionary connection between the helium ",
