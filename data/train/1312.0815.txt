    "quasi-2d correlated oxides with honeycomb layers have been attracting considerable interest in the last years  @xcite largely because of their capacity to host interesting topological and frustration phenomena  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is na@xmath2iro@xmath15 where several critical energy scales are comparable , such as one - electron hopping @xmath16 hubbard repulsion @xmath17 hund s rule coupling @xmath18 and spin - orbit interaction @xmath19 a possible , albeit not necessary , consequence of the competition between several comparable energy scales is strong frustration , in particular magnetic , which may lead to long - sought spin - disordered phases at zero temperature .",
    "it was recently proposed  @xcite that na@xmath2iro@xmath3 and li@xmath2iro@xmath3 form a continuous solid solution , with the nel ordering temperature maximized in the end compounds and going near to zero at an intermediate doping , ( na@xmath0li@xmath20iro@xmath15 @xmath21 such a quantum phase transition would be of great interest , as it would allow going from a quantum spin liquid state to different types of long range order by changing doping in two different directions .    in this work",
    "we show , both experimentally and theoretically , that the assumption of a continuous solid solution is not justified .",
    "in particular , for @xmath22 the system experiences a phase separation , which has a profound physical reason .",
    "specifically we find that the @xmath11 state , namely the one where all na in the ir@xmath2na planes are substituted by li while na@xmath3 plane remains intact , is exceptionally stable .",
    "this stability is gained through the fact that li is smaller than na and therefore allows shorter ir - ir bond lengths , when placed in the same plane . indeed ,",
    "as was observed earlier ,  @xcite two different ir - ir hoppings compete in this system : direct overlap of the like orbitals , and indirect , o - assisted hopping of unlike orbitals .",
    "even small changes in geometry affect this competition dramatically .",
    "on the other hand , partial substitution of the interlayer na by li is not energetically favorable because the interlayer separation is defined by the larger na ions and is not optimal from the li point of view .",
    "this is why compositions with @xmath22 prefer phase separation .",
    "we also observe a nel temperature reduction with increasing doping up to @xmath23 as was previously reported .",
    "@xcite in fact , our findings on the underlying doped lattices are essential to understand both the nel temperature reductions as pure end - members are respectively doped ( it is likely that the mechanisms are different for the na - rich and li - rich alloys ) , and the nature of the putative quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , we observe a chemical phase separated region in the ( na@xmath0li@xmath14)@xmath5iro@xmath7  phase diagram for @xmath22 ( extending to at least @xmath24 ) , which question a continuous qpt at @xmath25 as suggested cao et .",

    "after prereaction at 900@xmath26c the polycrystalline material was processed for crystal growth with excess iro@xmath2 flux .",
    "the amount of excess iro@xmath2 and the temperature of crystal growth were varied for different doping levels . since with increasing li content the solubility of the phase in the flux decreases , it is important to control both temperature and excess iro@xmath5 for obtaining large enough crystals for bulk measurements .",

    "in contrast to the claim of ref .   we have found that it is not possible to detect li by an energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis since li is a light metal . in edx",
    "we can only observe changes in the na to ir ratio , which decreases with li doping .",
    "table  [ table : icpms ] gives a comparison between the nominal ( starting composition ) and the measured li fractions .",
    "some of the plate - like crystals were crushed and powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed for the scattering angle range @xmath28 with cu k@xmath29 radiation to estimate the change of the lattice parameters with li doping .",
    "single crystal x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed using a mo - source oxford diffraction supernova diffractometer on crystals of ( na@xmath0li@xmath1)@xmath2iro@xmath3 with nominal doping @xmath30 from 0.05 to 0.4 in order to obtain lattice parameters and confirm the crystal structure and internal atomic coordinates .",
    "the samples were thin , plate - like crystals with a typical size of @xmath31m@xmath32 .",
    "magnetization , ac susceptibility and specific heat were measured in commercial squid magnetometer and physical property measurements systems , respectively .",
    "since the size of li - doped crystals decreases with doping , we have used lumps of crystals for magnetization and specific heat measurements",
    ". crystals ( or lumps ) have been separated mechanically .",
    "sometimes some remaining flux is present in the lump which gives a low temperature curie tail in the @xmath33 measurement .",
    "in order to determine the most realistic doped structures , we performed structural relaxations on supercells of ( na@xmath0li@xmath1)@xmath2iro@xmath3 for li dopings @xmath34 in steps of @xmath35 within density functional theory ( dft ) .",

    "we followed therefore the following strategy . for the rather expensive determination of the most stable configurations for each doping level we initially considered the gga functional without inclusion of soc and magnetism .",
    "the information gained from these results was subsequently used to perform more elaborate calculations including spin - orbit coupling , a hubbard repulsion @xmath39  ev and spin polarization ( spin - polarized gga+soc+u ) .",
    "we found that while these more precise calculations lead to much better comparison of lattice parameters with experiment , at the qualitative level the plain gga calculations seem to be sufficient .    for our gga calculations we considered all possible li configurations in a unit cell containing four formula units and searched for the most stable case .",
    "in order to verify the stability of the configurations , we also considered for some dopings supercells of sizes 2@xmath401@xmath401 and 1@xmath402@xmath401 where the unit cell with four formula units was doubled along @xmath41 and along @xmath42 respectively .",

    "we faced nevertheless a few challenges when refining the diffraction pattern of the li - doped samples .",
    "namely , li scatters x - rays very weakly and its precise position in the structure can not be uniquely determined from x - ray measurements alone , especially at low li concentrations and in the presence of dominant scatterers like ir ( with 77 electrons ) , refinements of the crystal structure with li in different na positions ( in the honeycomb ir@xmath5na layer and in the hexagonal na@xmath7 layer ) gave rather similar results . since structural relaxation calculations ( see previous section ) suggest a strong energetic preference for the doped li to replace the na in the ir honeycomb layers ( for @xmath9 ) , the final structural refinement ( within sir-92 and shelx packages  @xcite ) was performed assuming that li randomly replaces na at this site .",
