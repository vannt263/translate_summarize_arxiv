    "we discuss this below .",
    "next assume that all oscillators couple to the qubit with the same angle @xmath116 .",
    "this may follow from microscopic considerations or may be engineered . for example , when all oscillators couple diagonally to the qubit in a basis described by pauli matrices @xmath117 , then an experiment where the qubit is driven via @xmath118 while @xmath119 is kept constant , is described by our hamiltonian  ( [ e.ham1 ] ) with all angles @xmath116 .",

    "mean in short : the measurement of @xmath127 and @xmath128 and the subsequent parameter fixing of appropriate model spectral densities .",
    "more in detail , we propose to perform lz sweeps and to determine transition probabilities for several fixed values of the tunable intrinsic interaction @xmath5 .",

    "depicts corresponding final transition probabilities for several coupling angles .",
    "diagonal ( @xmath133 ) and transverse ( @xmath106 ) coupling are limiting cases which have in common that @xmath129 and hence @xmath134 assume their minima for @xmath135 . neither limiting case is suitable for gauging @xmath127 . since for intermediate cases @xmath136 we find a minimal transition probability for a _ nonzero _ internal interaction @xmath137 , one can determine the reorganization energy @xmath127 by measuring @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , the integrated spectral density @xmath128 can then be identified as @xmath139 . as a consistency test",
    ", one can check whether @xmath140 holds .",
    "consistency can be further tested by changing the basis in which the lz sweep is performed : the values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 should come out independent of the angle @xmath130 . if not , then @xmath102 is not constant and eq .",
    "( [ w2finalcontinuum ] ) applies .    with the values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 thus determined",
    ", one can fix parameters in appropriate model spectral densities . for example , suppose @xmath104 has the known form @xmath141 with a power @xmath142 given by the physical nature of the environment @xcite , but with unkown strength @xmath143 and cutoff frequency @xmath144 .",
    "( @xmath145 is the ohmic case and for @xmath146 , @xmath127 would diverge . )",
    "then @xmath147 , in terms of the gamma function , and @xmath148 .",
    "hence lz gauging fixes @xmath149 and @xmath143",
    ". other spectral densities may depend on more parameters .",
    "lz gauging fixes two of them .",
    "the efficient use of our gauging scenario requires the following : for @xmath134 to change considerably , one chooses @xmath150 such that @xmath151 and varies @xmath5 on the scale of @xmath152 . then @xmath127 can be measured accurately if @xmath153 is not much smaller than @xmath154 , or @xmath155 not much smaller than unity for an ohmic bath .",
    "so @xmath134 is robust under dephasing , even if dephasing is much faster than relaxation ( @xmath156 ) , unless the qubit - bath coupling is strong .",
    "this robustness has found its use in experiments on molecular nanomagnets @xcite .",
    "we presented in eqs .",
    "( [ transitionsexact ] ) and ( [ w2final ] ) exact landau - zener transition probabilities for a qubit with arbitrary linear coupling to a zero - temperature bath .",
    "we found that qubit and bath end up entangled .",
    "our results apply to experiments where the initial and final qubit energies are off - resonant with relevant bath frequencies , for example in circuit qed @xcite , where qubit energies can be varied over a broad range and spectral densities are peaked @xcite .",
    "indeed , our predictions for transverse coupling generalize our detailed study of lz sweeps in circuit qed @xcite to more realistic situations where peaked spectral densities have nonzero widths .",
    "other applications include tunable atoms in optical cavities and in photonic crystals .    for diagonal coupling",
    "we find that the transition probability does not depend on the bath at all .",
    "our exact result settles a long - standing discussion @xcite , at least for zero temperature .",
    "it corroborates and interpolates between what ao and rammer @xcite found for the fast - passage limit @xmath157 and for the opposite adiabatic limit @xmath157 , which both have been confirmed numerically @xcite .",
    "for fast lz sweeps , the bath clearly has no time to affect the transition , but the absence of any bath influence also for slower sweeps is a highly nontrivial property of this standard model .    a qubit undergoing a lz sweep measures ` global ' properties of the bath , namely the frequency - integrated spectral density , and for strong coupling the reorganization energy .",
    "sample - dependent spikes in spectral densities are therefore averaged out , even in a single sweep , so that model parameters can be determined .",
    "we therefore propose to employ lz transitions for a valuable gauging of the dissipative environment of a tunable qubit ."
