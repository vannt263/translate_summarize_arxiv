    "nanometer - size domains of the @xmath0 structure have recently been reported in steel , i.e. , fe - c - based alloys , by detailed transmission electron microscopy observations @xcite .",
    "this motivated us to investigate the stability of the @xmath0 structure in steel .",
    "the present authors group has emphasized the importance of the @xmath0 structure on transformation between the bcc and the fcc structures in metallic systems .",
    "togo and tanaka developed a search algorithm for transformation pathways based on a systematic set of first - principles calculations and revealed that the @xmath0 structure was located on a transformation pathway between the bcc and the fcc structures @xcite .",
    "ikeda et al . suggested that the pressure - induced phase transition between the bcc and the fcc fe at high temperature occurred along this transformation pathway @xcite .",
    "the present authors recently performed a systematic investigation into the @xmath0 structure of transition elements @xcite .",
    "the elemental @xmath0 fe with antiparallel magnetic moments ( @xmath1 magnetic state ) was found to be the lowest in energy among the investigated magnetic states and to be mechanically stable .",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath0 fe was , however , 170  mev / atom higher in energy than the ferromagnetic ( fm ) bcc fe .",
    "this implies that the elemental @xmath0 fe should be difficult to be formed . in experiments , however , the nanometer - size @xmath0 structure was observed in steel @xcite .",
    "the largest difference between elemental fe and steel may be the presence of c atoms , but little has been known about effects of the c atoms on the stability of the @xmath0 structure in steel .",
    "here we report a first - principles study on the stability of the @xmath0 structure in steel with special interests in effects of interstitial c atoms .",
    "four different magnetic states of the @xmath0 structure investigated in our previous study @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) in ref .",
    "@xcite for notations of the magnetic states ) are focused on .",
    "possible interstitial sites for c atoms in the @xmath0 structure are first systematically searched , and then the energy of the @xmath0 structure is compared with that of the fm bcc at several c concentrations using supercell models .",
    "finally , mechanical stability of the @xmath0 structure is analyzed based on phonon frequencies at the @xmath2 point of the supercell models .",
    "the @xmath0 structure belongs to the hexagonal crystal system , and hence its primitive unit cell is specified by two lattice constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0 structure has three atoms inside the primitive unit cell , and their positions are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 in fractional coordinates",
    ". the @xmath0 structure can actually be obtained from the bcc structure by repeating to collapse a pair of neighboring @xmath8 } planes and to hold the next plane unaltered .",
    "four magnetic states , which were focused on in our previous study @xcite , were investigated for the @xmath0 structure . the fm bcc structure and cementite fe@xmath9c@xmath10",
    "were also calculated for comparison . the @xmath0-based bcc unit cell ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) in ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) was used for the calculation of the fm bcc structure so that computational conditions for the @xmath0 and the bcc structures are as similar to each other as possible .    to systematically search possible interstitial sites for c atoms in the @xmath0 structure in fe",
    ", we used the @xmath0 fe@xmath11c@xmath10 model composed of the @xmath12 supercell of the primitive @xmath0 unit cell for fe and an interstitial c atom .",
    "the possible interstitial sites were searched in the following procedure .",
    "first , we divided a primitive @xmath0 unit cell into the @xmath13 mesh and put a c atom on the mesh points that are symmetrically inequivalent to each other .",
    "the numbers of the inequivalent points were 30 for the @xmath14 magnetic state and 21 for the other magnetic states .",
    "then , we optimized lattice parameters and internal atomic positions of the structures of the supercell models .",
    "some of the supercell models showed atomic positions largely deviated from those of the initial @xmath0 structure after the structural optimization .",
    "these models were excluded from further consideration .",
    "similarly , some models were excluded because the initially given magnetic state was broken after the structural optimization .",
    "energies of the models were calculated based on the plane - wave basis projector augmented wave method @xcite in the framework of density - functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation of the perdew - burke - ernzerhof form @xcite as implemented in the vasp code @xcite .",
    "a plane - wave energy cutoff of 400  ev was used .",
    "the brillouin zones were sampled by the @xmath2-centered @xmath15 mesh per primitive @xmath0 unit cell , and the methfessel - paxton scheme  @xcite with a smearing width of 0.4  ev was employed .",
    "total energies were minimized until the energy convergences to be less than 10@xmath16  ev .",
    "lattice parameters and internal atomic positions were optimized under zero external stress .",
    "phonon frequencies were investigated within the harmonic approximation for a lattice hamiltonian using the finite - displacement method .",
    "atomic displacements of 0.01   were used to obtain the second - order force constants .",
    "phonon modes at the @xmath2 point of the supercell models were calculated to investigate their mechanical stability . when there are phonon modes with imaginary frequencies , the structure is considered to be mechanically unstable .",
    "the phonopy code  @xcite was used for these phonon calculations .",
    "in our previous study @xcite , we made a systematic first - principles study on thermodynamical and mechanical stability of the @xmath0 structure in 27 transition elements ( sc to cu , y to ag , and lu to au ) .",
    "only the @xmath0 structures of the group 4 elements ( ti , zr , and hf ) , the group 7 elements ( mn , tc , and re ) , and fe were found to be mechanically stable in their lowest - energy magnetic states . for the elemental @xmath0 fe ,",
    "the @xmath1 magnetic state was the lowest in energy among the investigated magnetic states .",
    "it was , however , 170  mev / atom higher in energy than the fm bcc fe .",
    "this implies that the elemental @xmath0 fe is difficult to be formed from the viewpoint of thermodynamical stability . in the following ,",
    "we investigate whether the presence of interstitial c atoms stabilizes the @xmath0 structure in fe .    .",
    "calculated energies of the @xmath0 fe@xmath11c@xmath10 models in mev/(fe  atom ) .",
    "the energies are relative to that for the fm bcc fe@xmath11c@xmath10 models where the c atom is located at an octahedral site .",
    "the first column shows the initial position of the interstitial c atom in fractional coordinates for a primitive @xmath0 unit cell in the supercell models before the structural optimization .",
    "`` na '' indicates that the corresponding structure could not be obtained because the optimized structure was largely deviated from the initial @xmath0 structure and/or because the initially given magnetic state was broken during the structural optimization .",
    "[ tb : energies_c_sites ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tb : imaginary_modes_concentration ] summarizes the number of imaginary phonon modes at the @xmath2 point of the fm and @xmath1 @xmath0 fe@xmath17c@xmath10 where the c atom is located at an octahedral site . except for the @xmath0 fe@xmath9c@xmath10 , which corresponds to 25  at.%  c , all the models with interstitial c atoms have one or more imaginary phonon modes at the @xmath2 point and hence are mechanically unstable .",
    "although the elemental @xmath1 @xmath0 fe is mechanically stable @xcite , it becomes mechanically unstable once it incorporates interstitial c atoms unless the c concentration is 25  at.% .",
    "this result indicates that the interstitial c atoms mechanically destabilize the @xmath0 structure in fe .",
    "although the @xmath0 fe@xmath9c@xmath10 shows no imaginary phonon modes at the @xmath2 point , the fm @xmath0 fe@xmath9c@xmath10 is still 25  mev/(fe  atom ) higher in energy than the fm bcc fe@xmath9c@xmath10 and hence is thermodynamically less favorable .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that cementite fe@xmath9c@xmath10 is thermodynamically much more favorable in such a high c concentration region .",
    "our first - principles calculations actually show that the fm cementite fe@xmath9c@xmath10 is 111 and 135  mev/(fe  atom ) lower in energy than the fm bcc fe@xmath9c@xmath10 and the fm @xmath0 fe@xmath9c@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the present calculations demonstrate that the @xmath0 structure is thermodynamically less favorable than the fm bcc irrespective of the c concentration up to 25  at.% .",
    "furthermore , the fm and the @xmath1 @xmath0 structures are mechanically unstable once they incorporate c atoms unless the c concentration is 25  at.% .",
    "these results imply the instability of the @xmath0 structure in fe - c alloys .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0 structure is mostly unstable and can not exist even as a metastable state in fe - c alloys . in experimental reports",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 structure was observed in steel as nanometer - size domains in the bcc structure or as nanometer - thick layers at twin boundaries of the bcc .",
    "based on the present theoretical results , we suggest that the @xmath0 structure in steel is formed under special atomic constraints at twin boundaries or other interfaces .",
    "it is actually known that twin boundaries in metallic systems sometimes show special structures such as the @xmath18 structure in cu and ag @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 structure acts as the transition state of a transition pathway between the bcc and the fcc structures , the @xmath0 structure in steel may be a kind of residue of the martensitic transformation .",
    "another possible factor may be enrichment of solute elements other than interstitial c atoms in the nanometer - scale regions .",
    "the specimens used in the experiments actually contain si , mn , and/or cr as well as c @xcite .",
    "finally we comment on theoretical calculations in ref .",
    "two points are inconsistent with the present results .",
    "first , the energy of the @xmath0 structure relative to that of the bcc structure is substantially different at 7.7 and 14.3  at.%  c between ref .",
    "@xcite and the present report .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite reported that the relative energies are 142 and 78  mev/(fe  atom ) at 7.7 and 14.3  at.%  c , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the present calculations show that the energies of the fm @xmath0 structure relative to those of the fm bcc are 174 and 112  mev/(fe  atom ) at 7.7 and 14.3  at.%  c , respectively , which are much larger than the values in ref .  @xcite . since the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite do not refer to magnetic states of the @xmath0 structure incorporating c atoms , it is difficult to discuss possible reasons for the discrepancies .",
    "note that the present calculations demonstrate that the fm @xmath0 structure is the lowest in energy among the magnetic states above 4  at.%  c , which was not reported in ref .",
    "second , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that the bcc fe@xmath9c@xmath10 changed to the @xmath0 fe@xmath9c@xmath10 without energy barriers .",
    "they did not , however , show the computational details for this issue .",
    "contrary to their results , our fm bcc fe@xmath9c@xmath10 is mechanically stable and is 25  mev/(fe  atom ) lower in energy than the fm @xmath0 fe@xmath9c@xmath10 .",
    "stability of the @xmath0 structure in steel is investigated based on first - principles with special interests in effects of interstitial c atoms .",
    "the energy of the @xmath0 structure is compared with that of the fm bcc , and mechanical stability is analyzed based on phonon frequencies at the @xmath2 point of supercell models .",
    "possible interstitial sites for c atoms in the @xmath0 structure are systematically searched , and the octahedral site is found to be the most favorable among the interstitial sites .",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath0 fe@xmath17c@xmath10 where the c atom is located at an octahedral site is the lowest in energy among the magnetic states below 4  at.% c , while the fm @xmath0 fe@xmath17c@xmath10 is the lowest above this concentration .    even when c atoms are incorporated in the @xmath0 structure , it is thermodynamically less favorable than the fm bcc .",
    "furthermore , the fm and @xmath1 @xmath0 structures are mechanically unstable once they incorporate c atoms unless the c concentration is 25  at.% .",
    "these results indicate that interstitial c atoms destabilize the @xmath0 structure in fe - c alloys .",
    "it is concluded that the @xmath0 structure is mostly unstable and can not exist even as a metastable state in fe - c alloys . the @xmath0 structure in steel observed in experiments",
    "may be stabilized under special atomic constraints at twin boundaries or other interfaces .",
