    "meromorphic connections are a classical subject , related for instance to linear differential systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; but in this paper we shall study them following a less classical point of view , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "a meromorphic connection  @xmath8 on a riemann surface  @xmath0 ( again , see section  [ section_preliminary ] for details ) can be represented in local coordinates by a meromorphic 1-form ; it turns out that the poles ( and the associated residues ) of this form do not depend on the coordinates but only on the connection .",
    "if @xmath9 is not a pole , as for ordinary connections in differential geometry , it is possible to use @xmath8 for differentiating along a direction @xmath10 any vector field @xmath11 defined along a curve in  @xmath0 tangent to  @xmath12 , obtaining a tangent vector @xmath13 . in particular",
    ", if @xmath14 is a smooth curve with image contained in the complement of the poles , it makes sense to consider the vector field @xmath15 along  @xmath16 ; and we shall say that @xmath16 is a _",
    "geodesic _ for  @xmath8 if @xmath17 .",
    "as far as we know , geodesics for meromorphic connections in this sense were first introduced in  @xcite . as shown there ,",
    "locally they behave as riemannian geodesics of a flat metric ; but their global behavior can be very different from the global behavior of riemannian geodesics .",
    "thus they are an interesting object of study _ per se _ ; but they also have dynamical applications , in particular in the theory of local discrete holomorphic dynamical systems of several variables  explaining why we are particularly interested in their asymptotic behavior .",
    "one of the main open problems in local dynamics of several complex variables is the understanding of the dynamics , in a full neighbourhood of the origin , of holomorphic germs tangent to the identity , that is of germs of holomorphic endomorphisms of  @xmath18 fixing the origin and with differential there equal to the identity . in dimension one ,",
    "the leau - fatou flower theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) provides exactly such an understanding ; and building on this theorem camacho ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) in 1978 has been able to prove that every holomorphic germ tangent to the identity in dimension one is locally topologically conjugated to the time-1 map of a homogeneous vector field .",
    "in other words , time-@xmath19 maps of homogeneous vector fields provide a complete list of models for the local topological dynamics of one - dimensional holomorphic germs tangent to the identity .    in recent years , many authors have begun to study the local dynamics of germs tangent to the identity in several complex variables ; see , e.g. , calle @xcite , hakim @xcite , abate , bracci , tovena @xcite , rong @xcite , molino @xcite , vivas @xcite , arizzi , raissy @xcite , and others . a few generalizations to several variables of the leau - fatou flower theorem have been proved , but none of them was strong enough to be able to describe the dynamics in a full neighbourhood of the origin ; furthermore , examples of unexpected phenomena not appearing in the one - dimensional case have been found .",
    "thus it is only natural to try and study the dynamics of meaningful classes of examples , with the aim of extracting ideas applicable to a general setting ; and camacho s theorem suggests that a particularly interesting class of examples is provided by time-1 maps of homogeneous vector fields .",
    "( actually , the evidence collected so far strongly suggests that a several variable version of camacho s theorem might hold : generic germs tangent to the identity should be locally topologically conjugated to time-1 maps of homogeneous vector fields .",
    "but we shall not pursue this topic here . )",
    "this is the approach initiated in  @xcite ; and we discovered that there is a strong relationship between the dynamics of the time-1 map of homogeneous vector fields and the dynamics of geodesics for meromorphic connections on riemann surfaces . to describe this relationship , we need to introduce a few notations and definitions .",
    "let @xmath20 be a homogeneous vector field on @xmath18 of degree  @xmath21 .",
    "first of all , notice that the orbits of its time-1 map are contained in the real integral curves of  @xmath20 ; so we are interested in studying the dynamics of the _ real _ integral curves of the _ complex _ homogeneous vector field  @xmath20 .",
    "( actually , it turns out that complex integral curves of a homogeneous vector field are related to  classically studied sections which are horizontal with respect to a meromorphic connection ; see @xcite for details . )",
    "a _ characteristic direction _ for @xmath20 is a direction @xmath22 such that the complex line ( the _ characteristic leaf _ ) issuing from the origin in the direction  @xmath12 is @xmath20-invariant .",
    "an integral curve issuing from a point of a characteristic leaf stays in that leaf forever ; so the dynamics in a characteristic leaf is one - dimensional , and thus completely known .",
    "in particular , if the vector field @xmath20 is a multiple of the radial field ( we shall say that @xmath20 is _ dicritical _ ) every direction is characteristic , the dynamics is one - dimensional and completely understood .",
    "so , we are mainly interested in understanding the dynamics of integral curves outside the characteristic leaves of non - dicritical vector fields .    then in @xcite we proved the following result :    let @xmath20 be a non - dicritical homogeneous vector field of degree @xmath23 in @xmath18 and let @xmath24 be the complement in @xmath18 of the characteristic leaves of @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath25\\colon { \\mathbb{c}}^n\\setminus\\{o\\}\\to{\\mathbb{p}}^{n-1}({\\mathbb{c}})$ ] denote the canonical projection .",
    "then there exists a singular holomorphic foliation @xmath26 of  @xmath27 in riemann surfaces , and a partial meromorphic connection @xmath8 inducing a meromorphic connection on each leaf of  @xmath26 , whose poles coincide with the characteristic directions of  @xmath20 , such that the following hold :    1 .",

    "thanks to this result , we see that the study of integral curves for a homogeneous vector field in @xmath18 is reduced to the study of geodesics for meromorphic connections on a riemann surface @xmath0 ( obtained as a leaf of the foliation  @xmath35 ) .    in @xcite",
    "the latter study has been carried out in the case @xmath36 , which is the only case arising when @xmath37 ( and indeed it has led to a fairly extensive understanding of the dynamics of homogeneous vector fields in @xmath38 , including the description of the dynamics in a full neighbourhood of the origin for a substantial class of examples ) ; the main goal of this paper is to extend this study from @xmath39 to a generic compact riemann surface , with the hope of applying in the future our results to the study of the dynamics of homogeneous vector fields in @xmath18 with @xmath40 .",
    "more precisely , we shall prove a poincar - bendixson theorem ( see theorems  [ pbgeneral ] and  [ pbgeneral_res_grafi ] ) describing the @xmath41-limit set of the geodesics for a meromorphic connection on a generic compact riemann surface .",
    "we recall that , in general , a ",

    "an important ingredient in our proof will indeed be another poincar - bendixson theorem , due to hounie ( @xcite ) , describing the minimal sets for smooth singular line fields on compact orientable surfaces ( which in turn follows from a similar statement for smooth vector fields , see @xcite ) .",

    "finally , in section [ section_geod_toro ] we present a detailed study of the geodesics for holomorphic connections on complex tori ( the only compact riemann surfaces admitting meromorphic connections without poles ) .",
    "throughout this paper we shall denote by @xmath0 a riemann surface and by @xmath42 the tangent bundle on @xmath0 .",

    "so we can associate to a holomorphic connection @xmath8 a conformal family of compatible local metrics .",
