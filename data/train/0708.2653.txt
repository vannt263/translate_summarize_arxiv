    "left - handed materials , plasmon - polariton systems , and localized modes in random media are attracting nowadays the ever - increasing interest of physicists and engineers .",
    "this is due to both the fundamental character of the problems and promising applications in photonics , subwavelength optics , random lasing , etc .",
    "there have been a number of separate investigations and reviews of these phenomena ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but no detailed comparison has been attempted in spite of their deep underlying similarities . discussing analogies between these systems and with their simple classical counterparts provides a more unified understanding , new insights , and can be illuminating .",
    "there are numerous examples of fundamental physical phenomena that can be explained in terms of classical oscillators .",
    "resonators provide the next - step generalization revealing additional common features such as , e.g. , the `` critical coupling effect '' crucial for open wave systems with dissipation .",
    "below we briefly describe the complex systems mentioned above and analyze them in terms of simple resonator models .",
    "note that here we do not consider microwave and optical resonators , quantum dots , mie resonances , impurity zones in periodic structures , cavities in photonic srystals , etc .",
    "our goal is to demonstrate that a broad variety of physical phenomena in systems that do _ not _ contain conventional resonant cavities , nonetheless can be adequately described in terms of classical resonators .      in 1968",
    "veselago examined electromagnetic wave propagation in a virtual medium with simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability @xcite .",
    "he showed that such left - handed medium ( lhm ) was characterized by an unusual negative refraction : the incident and refracted beams at the interface between the lhm and ordinary media ( hereafter , the vacuum ) lie on the same side of the normal to the interface .",
    "this property implies that a flat lhm slab can act as a lens forming a 3d image of the object , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "interest in lhm grew very fast after pendry s paper @xcite , where it was shown that a lhm slab can act as a _ perfect _ lens .",
    "namely , a lhm slab with permittivity and permeability having the same absolute value as in the surrounding medium @xmath0 forms a perfect copy of an object : all details of the object , even smaller than the wavelength of light , are reproduced ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "left - handed materials are artificial periodic structures ( metamaterials ) , and any `` perfect lens '' will have a finite resolution limited by the size of the unit cell .",
    "metallic thin films can also provide super - resolution for the near evanescent field @xcite .",
    "but for propagating waves , a metallic layer acts as a very good mirror : only an exponentially small part of the radiation can penetrate through it .",
    "surprisingly , in 1998 ebbesen _",
    "_ @xcite found that an optically opaque metal film perforated with a periodic array of _ sub - wavelength_-sized holes was abnormally _ transparent _ for certain resonant frequencies or angles of incidence , fig",
    ".  2 . the energy flux through the film can be orders of magnitude larger than the cumulative flux through the holes when considered as isolated ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to its fundamental interest , this effect offers promising applications as tunable filters , spatial and spectral multiplexors , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "total internal reflection ( tir ) occurs when an oblique light beam strikes an interface between two transparent media , and the refractive index is smaller on the other side of the interface .",
    "for instance , the incident light is totally reflected from the prism bottom ( which is the tir surface ) , as shown in fig .",
    "a polished silver plate is also a very good mirror that reflects all the incident light , as in fig .",
    "however , when the tir surface and the plate are located right next to each other , the reflected beam can disappear and all the light can be _ totally absorbed _ by the silver plate @xcite , as illustrated in fig .  3c",
    ".    total absorption can also be observed in the microwave frequency band . when replacing the prism by a reflecting sub - wavelength diffraction grating , fig .",
    "3d , and the silver plate by an overdense plasma ( i.e. , a plasma whose langmuir ( plasma ) frequency is higher than the incident wave frequency ) , fig .  3e",
    ", the same effect appears : the incident electromagnetic wave can be totally absorbed by the plasma @xcite , fig .  3f , even though both elements act separately as very good mirrors .",
    "extraordinary optical transmission and total absorbtion can be observed in a quite different system : 1d random dielectric media .",
    "although the medium is locally transparent , the wave field intensity typically decays exponentially deep into the medium , so that a long enough sample reflects the incident wave as a good mirror .",
    "this is because of multiple wave scattering in randomly - inhomogeneous media producing a strong ( anderson ) localization of the wave field @xcite ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a simple manifestation of this effect is the almost - total reflection of light from a thick stack of transparencies @xcite .",
    "however , there is a set of resonant frequencies , individual for each random sample , which correspond to a _",
    "high transmission _ of the wave through the sample accompanied by a large concentration of energy in a finite region inside the sample @xcite ( see fig .  4 ) . like optical `` speckle patterns '' ,",
    "such resonances ( localized states ) represent a unique `` fingerprint '' of each random sample . in active random media , regions that localize waves",
    "are sources of electromagnetic radiation producing a so - called random lasing effect , which offers the smallest lasers , just a few - wavelengths in size @xcite .",
    "if the sample has small losses , the resonant transparency can turn into a _ total absorption _ of the incident wave @xcite .",
    "the notion of resonator implies the existence of eigenmodes _ localized _ in space .",
    "the localization of modes is usually achieved by a sandwich - type `` mirror - cavity - mirror '' structure which is analogous to a quantum - mechanical potential well bounded by potential barriers and can be of any nature ( see fig .  5 ) . in a closed resonator without dissipation",
    "each mode is characterized by its resonant frequency ( energy level ) @xmath1 and spatial structure of the field @xmath2 .",
    "the eigenmode field @xmath3 can be factorized as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a solution of the harmonic oscillator equation : @xmath6 depending on whether the modes are localized in all spatial dimensions or not , the resulting spectrum can be either discrete or continuous .",
    "the resonator can be non - conservative due to internal _ dissipation _ of energy .",
    "furthermore , the barriers can allow small energy _",
    "leakage _ either from or to the cavity , e.g. due to ` under - barrier ' tunnelling via evanescent waves . in such cases",
    "one has to consider the resonator as an open system with quasi - modes characterized by fuzzy energy levels of a finite width , fig .",
    "the time dependence of the fields is not purely harmonic anymore and can be described as an oscillator with damping :    @xmath7    here , the dimensionless _ q - factor _ characterizes the total losses in the resonator :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the q - factors responsible for the dissipation and leakage , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless half - width of the resonant peak in the spectrum equals @xmath11      the tunnelling of an incident plane wave through an open 1d resonator is characterized by the transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the transmittance @xmath12 is usually small due to the opaque barriers , but if the frequency of the incident wave coincides with one of the eigenmode frequencies , an effective resonant tunneling occurs . the corresponding transmission coefficient , @xmath14 , is given by @xcite :    @xmath15    here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the leakage q - factors ( @xmath18 ) , which are related to the transmittances @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the two barriers by @xcite    @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the wave group velocity inside the resonator and @xmath23 is the resonator cavity length ( so that @xmath24 is the round - trip travel time of the wave inside the cavity ) .",
    "hereafter we will assume @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the wave number of the resonant wave .",
    "note that the total transparency , @xmath27 , is achieved only in a dissipationless symmetric resonator , i.e.    @xmath28    the reflection coefficient @xmath13 is close to unity off - resonance and is characterized by sharp resonant dips on - resonance .",
    "the resonant reflection coefficient is given by @xcite :    @xmath29    in contrast to the transmittance ( [ eq3 ] ) , the reflectance ( [ eq6 ] ) reaches its minimum value also in dissipative asymmetric resonators @xcite :    @xmath30    this is the so - called _ critical coupling _ effect . in the important particular case when the second barrier is opaque , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , so that the total transmittance vanishes , @xmath33 , the reflectance spectrum exhibits pronounced resonant dips , with @xmath34 , if the leakage and dissipation q - factors are equal to each other ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath35",
    ". then , the incident wave is totally absorbed by an open resonator , so that all the wave energy penetrates into the resonator and dissipates therein .",
    "two resonators can be coupled by the fields penetrating through the barriers .",
    "this system ( outside the critical coupling regime ) can be effectively described by the coupled oscillators model .",
    "when the first ( incoming ) resonator is excited by a monochromatic source with frequency @xmath36 , the appropriate oscillator equations can be written as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath39 is the field in the first ( second ) resonator , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the dimensionless time and frequency , @xmath42 is the coupling coefficient , and @xmath43 is the effective exciting force from the incident field .",
    "the steady - state solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) are oscillations with amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 given by : @xmath46    near - resonance , @xmath47 , the frequency dependencies of these amplitudes at different values of the @xmath48 factor are shown in fig .",
    "there can be seen that when the condition @xmath49 is satisfied , there are two collective resonant modes with equal field amplitudes in the two resonators .",
    "their frequencies are shifted from the eigenfrequency of the oscillators , @xmath50 , due to losses and coupling : @xmath51 as @xmath48 decreases , the resonant peaks in the spectra are located near each other and meet when @xmath52 . in the regime",
    "@xmath53 there is one peak at @xmath54 .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 that appears in the model has a simple physical meaning : it determines whether the two resonators should be considered as essentially coupled or isolated .",
    "when @xmath55 , the losses are negligible and the field characteristics are essentially determined by the coupling . remarkably , in this case the field intensity in the first ( incoming ) resonator is negligible at @xmath54 , and almost all the energy is concentrated in the second resonator : @xmath56 . on the contrary ,",
    "when the losses prevail over the coupling , @xmath57 , the incident wave only excites the first resonator , and the energy is concentrated mostly in it : @xmath58 .",
    "the interface between materials with different signs of the permittivity , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , ( or permeability , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , supports surface @xmath63- ( or @xmath64- ) polarized waves , also known as _ plasmon - polaritons _ ( pp ) .",
    "pp were discovered in 1957 by ritche @xcite while studying a metal - vacuum interface . renewed",
    "interest in plasmon - polaritons comes from their considerable role in contemporary nano - physics @xcite .",
    "the interface between regular ( @xmath59 , @xmath61 ) and left - handed ( @xmath60 , @xmath62 ) materials supports pp with an arbitrary polarization @xcite .",
    "pp are electromagnetic waves which are trapped at the interface , their electromagnetic fields decaying exponentially deep into both media ( fig .",
    "hence , the interface forms a peculiar resonator with eigenmodes which are localized along the normal to the interface but can propagate freely along the interface .",
    "spatial eigenfunctions of this resonator have the form :    @xmath65 and are characterized by a dispersion relation @xmath66 . here",
    "the interface is associated with the @xmath67 plane , the subscript `` @xmath68 '' indicates vectors within the @xmath69 plane , and the decay constant @xmath70 can take different values in the two media .",
    "the plasmon - polariton resonator possesses all the features that are inherent to usual resonators : eigenfrequency , q - factor , topography of eigenmode fields , etc .",
    "it will be shown below that the identification of pp as a resonator is more than an analogy , since it captures the main physical process underlying this phenomenon .",
    "an exponential profile of the pp field suggests that it can interact with _ evanescent _ , non - propagating fields from an external source , which are characterized by a purely imaginary wave - vector component : @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , an incident _ propagating _ electromagnetic plane wave can not excite the pp resonator . this is because for propagating waves ( pw ) @xmath72 , whereas for plasmon - polaritons @xmath73 . at the same time ,",
    "evanescent waves ( ew ) are characterized by @xmath74 and can excite the pp resonator .",
    "there are methods to convert a propagating wave into an evanescent one .",
    "this allows the interaction of light with plasmon - polaritons , which has lead to a new branch of physics : _ plasmonics _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us examine the transmission of a plane wave through an optically thick metal film perforated with small , sub - wavelength holes , as shown in fig .",
    "two surfaces of the smooth metal film can be associated with two identical pp resonators , coupled by their fields , as shown in fig .",
    "as it has been noticed , pps can not be directly excited by the incident plane wave ; however , pps can interact through periodic modulations of the surface @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction of pps with light occurs at some resonance frequency @xmath75 ( or angle of propagation @xmath76 ) , at which their wave vectors differ by a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath77 :    @xmath78    one can say that the pp wave vector shifted by a reciprocal lattice vector acquires a real @xmath79-component , or vice versa , the shifted propagating mode becomes evanescent in the @xmath79 direction .",
    "thus , the periodic structure can be considered as a _ mode transformer_. ( it is worth remarking that while in microwave electronics such structures are used for slowing down the eigenmodes , here we deal with a speedup of the pp eigenmodes . )",
    "the periodic corrugation of the metal surface can be treated as a diffraction grating placed on the surface .",
    "the grating can be located at a distance @xmath80 from the smooth surface ; it remains coupled with plasmons - polaritons by their field @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "7b , c .",
    "now we can make use of the general theory of resonators .",
    "assuming the dissipation to be negligible , @xmath81 , the q - factor of the pp resonator is determined by the energy leakage from the resonator due to the transformation of the evanescent waves into the propagating ones :    @xmath82    here , @xmath83 is the transformation coefficient at the diffraction grating , and the exponential dependence arises due to decay of the evanescent field intensity between the metal surface and grating .",
    "the coupling coefficient between the two pp resonators is determined by the field of the first resonator acting on the second one : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the film thickness .",
    "the dependence of the transmission coefficient @xmath12 on the normalized incident wave frequency @xmath86 is described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq8])([eq10 ] ) , and is illustrated in fig .",
    "it exhibits two nearby peaks : @xmath27 at @xmath87 , when @xmath88 , or one peak @xmath89 at @xmath54 when @xmath90 . a characteristic field distribution for the total transmission is shown in fig .",
    "the coupling parameter decreases as @xmath85 grows , and the transmission spectrum @xmath91 changes as in fig .",
    "6a . the same dependence of the transmission spectrum on the film thickness has been obtained in @xcite and in many other papers concerned with particular geometries and specific modifications .",
    "in fact , all these features are just general properties of two coupled resonators , independently of details .",
    "thus , the light transmission through a perforated ( corrugated ) metal film can be divided into three processes : ( i ) transformation of the incident plane wave into an evanescent wave on the first diffraction grating , ( ii ) resonant `` penetration '' of the evanescent field through two coupled plasmon - polariton resonators , ( iii ) reverse transformation into the propagating wave on the second grating , fig .",
    "it may seem at first that the larger the transformation coefficient at the diffraction grating is , the better the transmission is .",
    "however , larger transformation coefficients result in smaller q - factors .",
    "when @xmath92 exceeds a critical value , the transmission becomes less than one and decreases with @xmath92 @xcite .      in the above model",
    ", it is easy to incorporate dissipation characterized by a small imaginary part of the dielectric constant , @xmath93 , by introducing the dissipation q - factor    @xmath94    the dissipation is negligible only if @xmath95 .",
    "otherwise , even very small dissipation will drastically affect the resonance phenomena as it is compared to the exponentially small parameters ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath96 , the dissipation may substantially suppress the transmission .",
    "when @xmath97 , the dissipation breaks down the coupling between two pp resonators on either side of the film , and they can be regarded as essentially independent . for the system under consideration",
    "this means that only the first resonator will be excited by the incident wave and the metallic film can be considered as a semi - infinite medium , fig .",
    "7c .    in such a case ,",
    "the transmission through the film vanishes at all frequencies . at the same time , the resonances show up in the reflection spectrum which exhibits sharp dips at some frequencies . for some critical distance between the diffraction grating and metal , @xmath98 ,",
    "the resonant reflectance drops to zero , @xmath34 , and the incident wave is totally absorbed by the metal , fig .",
    "3 . this effect can be readily explained in terms of the same resonator model : ( i ) the incident plane wave transforms into an evanescent mode at the diffraction grating and ( ii ) it excites a pp resonator at the metal surface and is totally absorbed due to the critical coupling effect , fig .",
    "7c . in our case",
    "the critical coupling condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , reads @xmath99 with eqs .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) . the application of diffraction gratings for the pp resonator excitation is most convenient in plasma experiments .",
    "when a properly designed grating is placed in front of the plasma surface , the reflected wave vanishes ( see fig .  3 bottom ) @xcite .    an analogous phenomenon in optics",
    "is known as `` frustrated total internal reflection '' @xcite . similarly to a diffraction grating , a total internal reflection interface can be used for plasmon - polariton excitation on a metal surface @xcite . in the so - called otto - configuration ,",
    "a metal is placed at a distance @xmath80 from the bottom of a prism where the light is totally reflected ( top of fig .",
    "3 ) . the incident light , with @xmath100 ,",
    "penetrates into the prism with the wave vector projection @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the refractive index of the prism ) .",
    "it generates an evanescent wave in vacuum near the bottom and can excite the the pp resonator at a resonance frequency @xmath75 ( or angle of propagation @xmath76 ) where    @xmath103    the leakage q - factor of the pp resonator is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) , where @xmath104 is the coefficient of transformation to the evanescent wave at the bottom of the prism . at a critical distance @xmath98 the reflected light disappears , which evidences the critical coupling regime .",
    "note that when the metal film is so thin that @xmath105 , the high resonant transparency of the film can be observed when the identical prism is located symmetrically near the opposite side of the film @xcite .",
    "this configuration is absolutely analogous to the above - considered grating  metal  grating system , fig .",
    "7b .    the total absorption of an incident wave due to the critical coupling can be used for the simultaneous determination of both the real and imaginary parts of the metal ( plasma ) permittivity .",
    "on the one hand , the resonant frequency @xmath1 ( or the angle of incidence ) is determined by the resonance with the pp mode , which depends on the real part of the metal permittivity , @xmath106 . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical coupling distance @xmath107 between the prism ( grating ) and the metal ( plasma ) surface depends on the dissipative q - factor ( [ eq14 ] ) related to the imaginary part @xmath108 of the permittivity .",
    "thus , the critical coupling regime provides a mapping between @xmath109 and @xmath110 and makes it possible to retrieve the complex permittivity of the metal ( plasma ) via external measurements .",
    "while a dielectric medium is transparent for propagating plane waves and a metal surface supports pp evanescent modes , a left - handed material combines both of these features .",
    "let the source of a monochromatic electromagnetic field ( the object ) be located at a distance @xmath80 from the surface of a flat slab of an ` ideal ' lhm ( @xmath111 ) of width @xmath112 , as shown in fig .",
    "the source radiates propagating plane - wave harmonics with @xmath113 , as well as evanescent waves with    @xmath114    the propagating waves are focused by the lhm slab and form the image on the opposite side of the slab , fig .  1 .",
    "the ideal lhm is perfectly matched with the vacuum due to the equivalence of their impedances @xmath115 , and , therefore , there is no reflected wave in this case .",
    "the image field is almost equal to the source one : all the plane waves reach the focal plane ( located at a distance @xmath116 from the slab ) with the same phase as they had in the source plane .",
    "the abberation ( imperfection ) of the image might only be caused by the loss of evanescent harmonics , which are responsible for the sub - wavelength details of the object .",
    "remarkably , even sub - wavelength information is not lost in the ideal lhm ( pendry s ) lens .",
    "this can be easily understood if we consider the surfaces of the lhm slab as two coupled pp resonators , as we did to explain the high transmission of the perforated metalic films .",
    "evanescent waves from the source excite the first pp resonator .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the pp mode at the ideal lhm / vacuum interface is that its dispersion relation is precisely the same as for evanescent modes in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "this implies that _ all _ the evanescent waves ( [ eq16 ] ) are in resonance with the pp resonator on the ideal lhm surface @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for any frequency ( the material dispersion is neglected here ) .",
    "the evanescent field distribution can be found from eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the pp resonators at the dissipationless lhm surface are characterized by an infinite q - factor ,    @xmath119    because there is no leakage from the pp to radiative modes .",
    "we associate the amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 with the field amplitude at the input and output surfaces of the slab . then the effective external force is given by    @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the amplitude of the evanescent field of the source .",
    "the coupling parameter is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , as it was for the metallic film .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) with @xmath54 and @xmath122 ( see also fig .",

    "7d ) :    @xmath126    since the phases of evanescent waves are not changed along the @xmath79-axis , the evanescent fields in the focal plane precisely reproduce those in the source plane .",
    "this means that the image created by both propagating and evanescent waves is a _",
    "perfect _ copy of the source .",
    "exactly the same evanescent field distribution in the pendry s lens follows from the accurate solution of maxwell equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the electromagnetic nature of waves has not been involved in our consideration of sub - wavelength imaging .",
    "the same result can be achieved using other kinds of waves , e.g. , liquid - surface waves @xcite , surface electromagnetic waves propagating along special types of interfaces  @xcite , and surface josephson plasma waves  @xcite in layered superconductors .",
    "if a small dissipation is present in lhm , it can be taken into account by introducing the dissipation q - factor ( refeq14 ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) ( here , for simplicity , the permeability is assumed to be real ) .",
    "the destructive effect of dissipation in the lhm , reducing the image quality , is defined by the ratio between the q - factor and the coupling parameter @xmath127 . when @xmath128 , the image abberation is small . when @xmath129 , the dissipation is crucial and practically destroys the penetration of evanescent waves through the lhm slab .",
    "this limitation of the ideality of pendry s lens has been discussed in @xcite using a wave approach . at the same time",
    ", the dissipation affects the propagating waves in a lhm lens in the same manner as in normal media , because the lhm slab do not form resonator for propagating waves .",
    "the dissipation significantly affects the propagation waves only when @xmath130 .",
    "the resonant transmission of waves through a 1d random sample is accompanied by a large concentration of energy inside the sample , as shown in fig .  4 .",
    "such field distributions can be regarded as quasi - modes of an open system . among various localized states ,",
    "high transparency accompanies only those modes that are located near the center of the sample .",
    "localized modes and anomalous transparency can be explained by the existence of effective high - q resonator cavities inside of the sample .",
    "figure  8 demonstrates the transparencies of different parts of the sample from fig .",
    "it is clearly seen that the middle section , where the energy was concentrated , is almost transparent to the resonant frequencies , while the side parts are practically opaque to the wave .",
    "thus , each localized state at a frequency @xmath75 can be associated with a typical resonator structure comprised of an almost transparent segment ( `` cavity '' ) bounded by essentially non - transparent regions ( `` barriers '' ) @xcite .",
    "the wave tunnelling through such a system can be treated as a particular case of the general problem of the transmission through an open resonator .",
    "the distinguishing feature of the random medium is that there are no regular walls ( the medium is locally transparent in each point ) and transmittances of barriers are exponentially small as a result of anderson localization .",
    "moreover , different segments of the sample turn out to be transparent for different frequencies , i.e. , each localized mode is associated with its own resonator .    the resonant tunnelling through a random sample can be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , where the barrier transmittances and q - factors are estimated as @xcite @xmath131 and the total leakage q - factor is @xmath132 . here",
    "@xmath133 and @xmath134 are the distances from the cavity to the ends of the sample ( the barrier lengths ) and @xmath135 is the localization length .",
    "the latter is the only spatial scale responsible for the localization , and the cavity size should be estimated as @xmath136 .",
    "this simple model drastically reduces the level of complexity of the problem : the disordered medium with a huge number of random elements can be effectively described now through a few characteristic scales , namely , the localization length , the wavelength , and the size of the sample . all the main features and characteristics of the resonances ( transmittance , field intensity , spectral half - width and the density of states ) can be estimated from the resonator model in good agreement with experimental data @xcite",
    ". in particular the perfect resonant transmission takes place only for a symmetric dissipationless resonator , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , which corresponds to wave localization in the middle of the sample and a maximal total q - factor .",
    "note that a long enough sample can contain two or more isolated transparent regions where the wave field is localized .",
    "these form the so - called `` necklace states '' predicted in @xcite and observed in @xcite .",
    "necklace states can be easily incorporated in our general scheme as two or more resonators coupled by their evanescent fields , eqs .",
    "( [ eq8])([eq10 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the coupling coefficient between the nearest resonators is    @xmath137    where @xmath85 is the distance between the effective cavities .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that dissipation in the sample material worsens the observability of resonances .",
    "however , surprisingly , small losses can improve the conditions for the detection of localized states",
    ". a large number of resonances , which are not visible in the transmission spectrum , become easily detected in the _ reflection _ spectrum @xcite , fig .  9 .",
    "this is clarified in terms of the critical coupling phenomenon . if the dissipation , @xmath138 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , exceeds the leakage , @xmath139 , for the modes localized in the middle of the sample :    @xmath140 the transmission is strongly suppressed for all frequencies , and @xmath141 . at the same time , the other states located closer to the input of the sample and , therefore , characterized by higher @xmath139 can be excited .",
    "according to the critical coupling condition ( [ eq7 ] ) , the resonant reflectance drops to zero when the dissipation and leakage q - factors are of the same order .",
    "for the modes localized in the first half of the sample we can set , with an exponential accuracy , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , so that the critical coupling condition reads @xmath35 as for the case of a semi - infinite medium .",
    "the resonator model enables one to find characteristic parameters of localized states and of the sample via external measurements of the transmission and reflection coefficients @xcite . by measuring resonant and typical off - resonance values of the transmittance and reflectance , eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , along with the resonance spectral half - width , it is possible to determine ( at least , to estimate ) the localization length , dissipation factor , position of the localized state , and its field intensity .",
    "some of these internal quantities usually can not be determined via direct measurements , but are crucial , e.g. , for the random lasing problem .",
    "for example , the critical coupling condition connects the position of the localization region with the dissipation rate in the medium , while the latter can be determined through the half - width of the resonant deep in the reflectance .",
    "it should be also noted that random systems consisting of repeated elements of several types can exhibit transmission resonances of another kind , which are not accompanied by the energy localization and can not be described by the resonator model , see , e.g. , @xcite .        * resonator characteristics *    &    * enhanced transparency *    &    * total absorption in plasma *    &    * frustrated tir in optics *    &    * ideal lhm lens *    &    * localization in random medium *     +    * dissipation q - factor , * @xmath138    & +    * leakage q - factor , * @xmath139    & &    @xmath144    &    @xmath145 , @xmath146     +    * coupling coefficient , * @xmath127    &    @xmath147    & &    @xmath147    &    @xmath148     +    * resonance condition , @xmath75 *    & &    @xmath149    &    @xmath150    &    @xmath75     +",
    "the sub - wavelength resolution of a flat lhm lens , abnormal transparency of a perforated metal film , localized states in disordered media , frustrated total internal refraction , and total absorption of an electromagnetic wave by an overdense plasma are all phenomena related to different areas of physics and are characterized by different spatial scales , from the nano - scale to centimeters and larger . in spite of such enormous differences ,",
    "the main properties of these phenomena have much in common with each other and , on a deeper level , with simple resonator systems .",
    "as we have shown , all these phenomena can be treated in a universal way as wave transmission through one or two coupled resonators .",
    "a careful mapping between the resonator and the problem parameters allows one to understand thoroughly the physical properties of the problem and forecast how the parameters affect the result .",
    "of course , accurate descriptions of wave transmission through complex systems ( for example , periodically - perforated metal films or random media ) involve particular details of a given sample and depend , e.g. , on the geometry of the periodic structure or on the specific realization of the random process .",
    "nonetheless , fundamental features of these systems which are independent of details can be revealed only through a unified approach emphasizing the physical essence of the problem .",
    "resonator models provide such an approach . in some cases ( e.g. , for evanescent fields in the lhm lens ) resonator description results in",
    "the _ exact _ solution of the problem .",
    "furthermore , in the case of random media such model is the _ only _ formalism which enables one to estimate the parameters of the individual localized states .",
    "one of the important common features of all resonator systems is their high sensitivity to internal dissipation .",
    "even very small dissipation , which has negligible effects for usual propagating waves , may dramatically modify the localized resonance states .",
    "usually dissipation destroys the resonant transmission but develops resonant dips in the reflection spectrum .",
    "the reason for this is that the excitation of a resonator is always accompanied by a huge field intensity therein , proportional to the q - factor .",
    "the energy dissipated per unit time is determined by the product of the dissipation rate and the field intensity .",
    "thus , a small dissipation rate is multiplied by a high q - factor and can be crucial . also , establishing a one - to - one correspondence with classical resonator allows retrieving the _ internal _ characteristics of an investigated system using the _ external _ response to a probing signal ( incident wave ) . in this way",
    ", one can determine the complex permittivity of metal or plasma , location and field intensity of localized states in random medium , etc .",
    "remarkably , dissipation can be favorable for such purposes , revealing some hidden internal features through the critical coupling effect .    to conclude ,",
    "the central result of this brief review , i.e. the mapping between the resonator and the problems parameters , is summarized in table  1 .",
    "we have considered only a few , probably more intriguing and non - trivial , systems allowing the resonator consideration .",
    "a more complete list of such systems would be much longer , since any wave system with localized modes can be treated as a generalized resonator .",
    "in particular , numerous quantum systems ( not considered here ) with potential wells , tunnelling , and relaxation could be effectively treated within the open - resonator framework ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it should be also noted that for some of the systems considered above there exist alternative _ ad hoc _ methods of description .",
    "for instance , negative refraction and optical cloaking allow a natural representation in the geometrical formalism of general relativity @xcite .",
