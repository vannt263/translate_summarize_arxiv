    "in recent years the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model has been used  @xcite as the simplest model which maps the electron correlations in the copper - oxide planes of high - temperature superconductors since experimental data suggest that superconductivity in cuprates basically originates from the cuo@xmath9 layers  @xcite .",
    "although in the high - temperature cuprate superconductors electron - electron interactions are strong some important features of these systems ( in particular , antiferromagnetic and @xmath5-wave superconducting instabilities ) are captured already by the 2d hubbard model at weak to moderate coulomb coupling .",
    "apart from the antiferromagnetism and @xmath4-wave superconductivity above mentioned ( for review see  @xcite and references therein ) , a few other instabilities related to symmetry - broken states  @xcite , and truncation of the fermi surface  @xcite in the 2d @xmath0 hubbard model with next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 have been reported .",
    "one of these phases is the staggered flux phase of singlet type with @xmath5-wave character which occurs in the particle - hole channel and breaks translational and time - reversal symmetries .",
    "the singlet flux phase has been discovered in the mean - field treatments of the 2d hubbard model by kotliar  @xcite , and independently by affleck and marston  @xcite .",
    "it has been discussed by nayak  @xcite and chakravarty et al .",
    "@xcite as a @xmath5-density wave state which may coexist with @xmath5-wave superconductivity .",
    "recently , a triplet analog of the staggered flux phase has been observed  @xcite also in the 2d @xmath0 hubbard model in certain regions of the parameters .",
    "another instability in the 2d @xmath0 hubbard model is a @xmath5-wave pomeranchuk instability breaking the tetragonal symmetry of the fermi surface , i.e. a spontaneous deformation of the fermi surface reducing its symmetry to orthorhombic .",
    "it has been recently observed for small values of @xmath1 from renormalization group calculations by halboth and metzner  @xcite .",
    "they argued that the pomeranchuk instability occurs more easily if the fermi surface is close to the saddle points of the single particle dispersion ( van hove filling ) with a sizable @xmath1 ( reducing nesting which leads to antiferromagnetism ) .",
    "however , within their technique it is difficult to compare the strength of the fermi surface deformation with other instabilities and to conclude which one dominates .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have investigated the interplay of @xmath5-density wave and fermi surface deformation tendencies with those towards @xmath5-wave pairing and antiferromagnetism by means of a similar temperature - flow renormalization group approach .",
    "they have found that the @xmath5-wave pomeranchuk instability is never dominant in the 2d @xmath0 hubbard model ( even under the conditions mentioned above ) . at the same time , the @xmath4-wave pomeranchuk instability has been observed  @xcite to be one of the strongest instability in the 2d hubbard model by means of the flow equations method , but these calculations have some limitations at low temperatures ( see section  [ sec2 ] ) .    on the other hand , vollhardt et al .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath1-hopping destroys antiferromagnetic nesting instability at weak interactions in two and three dimensions , and supports the stabilization of metallic ferromagnetism in infinite dimensions away from half - filling .",
    "therefore , one may expect also the stabilization of ferromagnetism by a sizable @xmath1 in two dimensions .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath0 hubbard model on a 2d square lattice at week to moderate coulomb coupling , a projection quantum monte carlo calculation with @xmath10 sites and the @xmath11-matrix technique  @xcite , a generalized random phase approximation including particle - particle scattering  @xcite point towards a ferromagnetic ground state for large negative values of @xmath1 in a density range around the van hove filling .",
    "similar tendencies have been found by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite within the renormalization group and parquet approaches .",
    "honerkamp and salmhofer recently studied  @xcite the stability of this ferromagnetic region at finite temperatures by means of the temperature - flow renormalization group technique .",
    "they have found that ferromagnetic instability is the leading one at @xmath12 and the van hove filling with critical temperatures depending on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "when the electron concentration is increased slightly above the van hove filling , the ferromagnetic tendencies get cut off at low temperatures and a triplet @xmath6-wave superconducting phase dominates . however , they did not consider the pomeranchuk instability and other ones apart from antiferromagnetism , @xmath5- and @xmath6-wave superconductivity and ferromagnetism .",
    "other instabilities recently found in the 2d hubbard model are an `` insulating spin liquid state ''  @xcite and `` band splitting '' phase  @xcite .",
    "insulating spin liquid phase is the state with truncated fermi surface and unbroken translational symmetry .",
    "it is insulating due to the vanishing local charge compressibility , and a spin liquid because of the spin gap arising from the pairing correlations .",
    "band splitting phase is a particle - hole instability of singlet type with @xmath6-type symmetry which has been found  @xcite close to half - filling .",
    "it leads to a splitting into two bands , and may lead to an energy gap in the charge excitations spectrum .",
    "in the present paper , which is the continuation and extended version of our previous work  @xcite , we investigate the possible phases of the 2d @xmath0 hubbard model on a square lattice with the help of the free energy expressions derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of the flow equations method .",
    "in addition to the short paper  @xcite we present a summary of the formalism , and give some details of numerical calculations as well as consider the case of arbitrary electron concentrations .",
    "the phases found by us are discussed in more details .",
    "we find all commonly discussed states as well as a few new possible phases .",
    "we determine in which regions various symmetry broken phases are more favorable than the symmetric ( i.e. normal ) state .",
    "this is done for various types of symmetry breaking independently , that is if no other symmetry breaking would be present .",
    "one phase may suppress another phase .",
    "to which extend two order parameters can coexist with each other is a question , which has to be investigated in the future .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we summarize the formalism , and represent the details of numerical calculations . in section  [ sec3 ] the numerical results of our stability analysis are given , and the possible phases of the model are discussed .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 hubbard model @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bloch electron energy with the momentum @xmath3 , @xmath15 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the electrons with spin projection @xmath16 , and initially @xmath17 is the local coulomb repulsion of two electrons of opposite spins , @xmath18 is the number of lattice points , lattice spacing equals unity .    for a square lattice",
    "the single particle dispersion has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hopping integral of electrons between nearest neighbors of the lattice , and @xmath1 is the next - nearest - neighbor hopping integral .",
    "the spectrum  ( [ ek ] ) contains van hove singularities in the density of states at the energy @xmath21 related to the saddle points of the fermi surface at @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for @xmath24 and half - filling the fermi surface",
    "is nested @xmath25 with @xmath26 , which leads to an antiferromagnetic instability for @xmath27 .",
    "the nesting is removed for @xmath28 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the following channels @xmath29 @xmath30 describes the coupling of electron - pairs , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are interactions showing up in fermi - liquid theory and describe ( homogeneous ) magnetism and pomeranchuk - instabilities , channels @xmath33 and @xmath34 describe antiferromagnetism and charge density waves with wave - vector @xmath35 as well as some other types of ordering .",
    "@xmath36 describes electron pairs with wave - vector @xmath35 .",
    "these channels are kept within our approach , but finally the effective interaction @xmath36 is rather weak .",
    "we apply the flow equation method  @xcite to this hamiltonian , that is we perform a continuous unitary transformation as a function of a flow parameter @xmath37 which brings the hamiltonian into a mean - field form , @xmath38 , \\quad \\eta(l)=[h(l),h^{\\rm r}(l)].\\ ] ] @xmath39 is the generator of the unitary transformation .",

    "we choose @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "this condition guarantees , that those interactions we wish to keep have @xmath47 and are kept , but the other ones have @xmath48 and thus will be eliminated . in this way we eliminate the fluctuations around the molecular - field type behavior and keep finally an interaction for which the molecular - field treatment is exact .    keeping these interactions in second order in the hubbard coupling @xmath49 by means of the flow equation method  @xcite the hamiltonian",

    "an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) is obtained for particle - hole channels with the order parameters @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 . in this case , for example , we have @xmath78 .",
    "in total we consider four channels , two particle - hole and two particle - particle ones , since the total momentum can be 0 and @xmath53 . in all cases we distinguish between singlet and triplet excitations , and in the channels corresponding to the total momentum @xmath35 we distinguish also between @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following notations : @xmath81 denotes particle - hole channel , @xmath82 denotes singlet ( triplet ) , @xmath83 corresponds to @xmath84 and @xmath80 respectively , otherwise @xmath52 .    in eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) and the analogous expressions for particle - hole channels one has @xmath85    the entropy coefficient function is @xmath86    we start from the symmetric state and investigate whether this state is stable against fluctuations of the order parameters @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "as soon as a non - zero @xmath77 or @xmath76 yields a lower free energy in comparison with the symmetric state with all vanishing @xmath77 and @xmath76 , then the symmetric state is unstable and the system will approach a symmetry broken state .",
    "this indicates a phase transition .",
    "of course , one phase may suppress another phase .",
    "to which extend two order parameters can coexist with each other is a question , which has to be investigated .",
    "but this problem lies outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "we performed numerical calculation on a square lattice with @xmath87 points in the brillouin zone for the various representations under the point group @xmath88 .",
    "this group consists of the following symmetry elements : mirror reflections with respect to the @xmath89- and @xmath90-axes and the lines @xmath91 , a fourfold rotation about the axis which is perpendicular to @xmath89-@xmath90-plane .",
    "the representations of the even - parity states are one - dimensional .",

    "the odd - parity representation is two - dimensional , here simply denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "initially , such numerical calculations have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but they were sensitive to the lattice size at low temperatures , specially for the particle - hole channels .",
    "the main problem is that the wave - vector space contributing essentially to the order parameter is very small at low temperatures as a result of exponential divergence of the entropy coefficients @xmath70 .",
    "as we consider the stability of the symmetric state with respect to a symmetry broken phase ( thus we are interested in small fluctuations of free energy  ( [ fe ] ) around zero ) and the energy contribution to eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) changes slowly , the entropy contribution has to change slowly also . rewriting eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) in terms of new renormalized order parameter @xmath93 , we conclude that the averaging @xmath94 has to be performed in @xmath3-space when we are calculating entropy coefficients . for the value of the inverse entropy coefficient",
    "@xmath95 we take the average value of the coefficients over @xmath96 lattice points of a grid with center at the @xmath97-point and the spacing @xmath98 .",
    "the number @xmath99 of points in momentum space is inversely proportional to temperature and @xmath100 , all together these points cover the brillouin zone .",
    "a similar procedure is applied to the chemical potential calculation .",
    "one should also perform the averaging in determination of effective interactions , but it would take much more time .",
    "we have checked the size effects in the framework of such an improved scheme , performing some calculations also for @xmath101 and @xmath102 lattices , and found that the differences are very small and unessential .",
    "although size effects increase at low temperatures in the low density region , they do not touch and change the leading instabilities essentially .    for each channel",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath103 have to be determined . whenever the lowest eigenvalue @xmath104 ( i.e. the most negative ) equals -1 , then a critical @xmath105 or @xmath106 is reached . for the @xmath107 representation ( in case of the effective interactions @xmath108 only for @xmath109 ) one has to find the solution by iterating the eigenvalue equation as a function of @xmath110 . in the case of all other representations",
    "the @xmath111-term does not contribute .",
    "therefore then we determine the lowest eigenvalue @xmath104 of the matrix @xmath112 , and obtain @xmath113 .",
    "we start from @xmath24 and half - filling @xmath114 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as expected in this case the leading instability is the antiferromagnetic one , it appears in the @xmath115 channel with @xmath116 symmetry and @xmath107 wave character . as we leave half - filling the antiferromagnetism becomes weaker ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and disappears at hole doping @xmath117 .",
    "as soon as the system is doped the nesting is reduced , since there are no longer points on the fermi surface connected by the wave - vector @xmath35 and we observe a reentrant behavior . the second order contribution to",
    "the antiferromagnetic channel suppresses antiferromagnetism ( at least in the @xmath118-channel ) .",
    "therefore antiferromagnetism disappears at larger values of @xmath110 .",
    "strong coupling calculations yield a @xmath119-model in which the exchange coupling decreases like @xmath120 for large @xmath49 .",
    "thus , our observation is remarkable , since we work with a weak - coupling calculation , we obtain at intermediate couplings the same tendency as it is expected at strong interactions although we do not reproduce the nel temperature behavior @xmath121 .",
    "we take the decrease of the nel temperature as an indication that the calculation in second order in @xmath49 yields reasonable results even for intermediate values @xmath122 . for stronger couplings",
    "higher order contributions will become important .",
    "however , it is of interest to see which instabilities emerge within our approximation for larger values of @xmath110 , since this gives a hint which types of ordering should be investigated for stronger couplings . therefore , we discuss the phase diagram obtained from the second order calculation also for larger values @xmath110",
    ". it might be also that higher order contributions neglected by us enhance the tendency towards antiferromagnetism , and then it will decay not so rapidly .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that already second order calculations give the qualitative description of antiferromagnetism at intermediate couplings . in the latter context",
    ", we make a comparison of our results with experimental data on some high - temperature cuprate superconductors and transition metal compounds . as one",
    "can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] antiferromagnetism disappears at the temperature @xmath123 . taking the estimation for the hopping integral @xmath124  ev , which is the realistic values for transition metal and their compounds  @xcite",

    "let us consider also the parent compound la@xmath9cuo@xmath126 of high-@xmath127 cuprate systems la@xmath128cuo@xmath126",
    "( @xmath129  sr , ba , ca ) .",

    "some of the model parameters deduced from photoemission and lda calculations are @xmath132  ev , and @xmath133  ev  @xcite .",
    "the main features of the three - band hubbard model can be mapped onto the single - band hubbard model , and therefore one may describe  @xcite these compounds by the hubbard model  ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath20 of such a single - band hubbard model are smaller in comparison with the corresponding parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 of the three - band extended hubbard model , the coulomb repulsion @xmath49 is specially reduced  @xcite .",
    "then , taking the values @xmath136  ev and @xmath137 ( it corresponds to @xmath138 ) we obtain the theoretical estimation of the n ' eel temperature for la@xmath9cuo@xmath126 around @xmath139  k , that is very close to the experimental value .    the next instability is a pomeranchuk instability with @xmath4-wave symmetry in the singlet channel ( namely @xmath140 ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector signals a deformation of the fermi surface which breaks the point group symmetry of the square lattice . at high temperatures the system has a tetragonal structure and an orthorhombic one at low temperatures .",
    "the @xmath4 wave pomeranchuk instability dominates in the region of temperature @xmath141 at small hole doping ( @xmath142 ) , and for negative @xmath143 the pomeranchuk instability dominates in all temperature region at the electron concentrations around the van hove filling ( see figs .",

    "it competes with other instabilities at @xmath144 and the electron concentrations around the van hove filling , and it is not the leading one here ( fig .",

    "but the @xmath5-wave pomeranchuk instability appears again to dominate at large negative @xmath144 in the region of electron density above the van hove filling and below some doping ( for example , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) ; for the value @xmath145 this value of doping equals @xmath146 . in agreement with the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite the instability is mainly driven by a strong attractive interaction between particles on opposite corners of the fermi surface near the saddle points and a repulsive interaction between particles on neighboring corners .",
    "to favor such a behavior we need a sizable @xmath1 reducing antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the critical temperature of the @xmath5-wave pomeranchuk instability occurrence decreases with increasing hole doping , and at sufficiently large values of doping and away from van hove filling this phase requires strong couplings .",
    "thus the hole doping suppresses the tendency towards an orthorhombic distortion of the fermi surface ( or lattice ) .",
    "the tendency towards a spontaneous deformation of fermi surface with @xmath5-wave character has been observed by a.  p.  kampf and a.  a.  katanin  @xcite to be one of the leading instabilities in the 2d extended @xmath49-@xmath147-@xmath148 hubbard model in the parameter range which is relevant for underdoped cuprate systems .",
    "a similar pomeranchuk instability has been found by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to be a characteristic of a nematic fermi fluid  @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "another possible phase is a particle - hole instability of singlet type with staggered @xmath6-wave symmetry ( @xmath149 ) .",

    "another mechanism for a charge gap formation has been proposed  @xcite recently in the 2d hubbard model with @xmath24 at weak coupling .",
    "the band splitting phase is developed in the region of electron concentration around half - filling , and is one of the strongest in that region .",
    "this instability dominates when the electron concentration @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the negative next - nearest - neighbors hopping favors this phase to be dominant instability at electron doping , but the value of coupling strength @xmath110 required for the occurrence of this instability increases with increasing @xmath157",
    ". the critical temperature of the transition to the band splitting phase decreases with increasing electron doping , thus the electron doping suppresses the tendency towards this phase .",
    "the singlet superconducting @xmath4 instability ( @xmath158 ) coincides with the @xmath4-wave staggered flux phase at half - filling and @xmath24 ( the discussion on flux phases appears in the next paragraph ) .",
    "away from half - filling the degeneration disappears , and @xmath5-wave superconductivity dominates at low temperatures in certain regions of electron concentration around half - filling which depend on the value of @xmath156 .",

    "@xmath183 a particle - hole instability with @xmath7-wave character ( @xmath194 , its order parameter changes sign close to the fermi - edge ) in the triplet @xmath107 channel dominates at @xmath195 and the density range around the van hove filling ( see figs",
    ".  [ fig5 ] ,  [ fig8 ] ,  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "it is likely that the order parameter contributions do not compensate exactly , so that a weak ferromagnetism appears .",

    "this is a result of different behavior of @xmath199 in two regimes .",
    "first regime occurs in the region where the @xmath7-magnetic instability dominates and the transition from a paramagnetic state to the @xmath7-magnetic phase occurs directly without any intermediate phase , it corresponds to the temperatures @xmath183 in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ,  [ fig9 ] . in this case",
    "the critical temperature increases with the increase of correlation strength @xmath110 . therefore electron correlations enhance the tendency towards the @xmath7-magnetic instability .",
    "another regime occurs at the temperatures @xmath192 , where the @xmath7-magnetic phase is not a leading instability and other instabilities dominate .",
    "in this situation the critical temperature exhibits an anomalous behavior , it decreases with increasing the coupling @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath7-magnetic phase is reduced .",
    "since at lower temperatures only a smaller region in @xmath200-space around the fermi - edge contributes , the sign - change of the order parameter reduces the effective interaction .",
    "as the transition to this phase requires some finite value of the effective interaction at low temperatures , the correlation strength has to increase rapidly .",
    "we observe also a few other weaker instabilities . apart from @xmath4 wave superconductivity mentioned above other two superconducting instabilities",
    "appear . at @xmath161",
    "a @xmath201 wave superconducting phase occurs in the singlet channel sufficiently below the van hove filling ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) , and for larger absolute values @xmath195 we observe a @xmath177 wave superconductivity in the @xmath107 singlet channel below the van hove filling ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "all these phases require strong couplings .    the peculiar feature of the superconducting phase in comparison with the other phases observed by us should be noted .",
    "away from the van hove filling when temperature approaches zero the curves corresponding to superconducting phase are flat , whereas the curves corresponding to all other phases observed become steep .",
    "therefore , at very low temperatures the transition from a paramagnetic phase to the superconducting one can occur at very small values of the corresponding effective interaction in contrast with the transitions to other possible phases which require some finite values of the effective interactions .",
    "one can see also that the critical temperatures of all phases ( excepting antiferromagnetism and @xmath7-magnetic phase in certain regions ) increase with the increase of correlation strength @xmath110 .",
    "thus , electron correlations enhance the tendency towards the transition to the phases observed by us .",
    "we have presented a stability analysis of the 2d @xmath0 hubbard model on a square lattice for various values of the next - nearest - neighbors hopping @xmath1 and electron concentration . on the basis of the free energy expression , derived by means of the flow equations method , we have performed numerical calculation for the various representations under the point group @xmath2 in order to determine the phase diagram . a surprising large number of phases has been observed .",
    "some of them have an order parameter with many nodes in @xmath3-space .    for small values of @xmath1 and doping",
    "the leading instability is the antiferromagnetic one . at @xmath24 antiferromagnetism",
    "disappears at hole doping @xmath202 and temperatures @xmath203 .",
    "this result reproduces the n ' eel temperatures in some antiferromagnetic materials .",
    "the @xmath4 wave pomeranchuk instability dominates in the region of temperature @xmath141 at small hole doping ( @xmath204 ) , and for negative @xmath143 the pomeranchuk instability dominates in all temperature region at the electron concentrations around the van hove filling .",
    "it is the leading instability at large negative @xmath144 in the region of electron density above the van hove filling and below some doping ; for the value @xmath145 this value of doping equals @xmath146 .",
    "the band splitting phase with staggered @xmath6-wave symmetry is developed in the region of electron concentration around half - filling , and is one of the strongest in that region .",
    "this instability dominates when the electron concentration @xmath155 and @xmath156 . the negative next - nearest - neighbors hopping favors this phase to be dominant instability at electron doping .",
    "the @xmath4-wave superconductivity dominates at low temperatures in certain regions of electron concentration around half - filling which depend on the value of @xmath156 .",
    "even large values of @xmath157 do not destroy the dominant low - temperature behavior of @xmath4-wave superconductivity at hole doping .",
    "it is not destroyed also at sufficiently large hole doping .",
    "however , this dominant behavior is destroyed around the van hove filling where other phases appear to dominate . at small electron doping",
    "@xmath5-wave superconductivity dominates at low temperatures also , but as a result of electron - hole asymmetry of the 2d @xmath0 hubbard model the @xmath5-wave superconductivity appears to dominate within wider region of hole doping in comparison with the electron doping for negative values of @xmath1 .",
    "triplet and singlet flux phases , which have degenerate critical temperatures at @xmath24 , occur more easily at the electron concentrations which are slightly above the van hove filling for @xmath156 . for non - zero values of the next - nearest - neighbors hopping the critical transition temperatures of these phases are different , and the triplet one is higher .",
    "the triplet analog of flux phase dominates at low temperatures and @xmath145 when the electron concentration is slightly above the van hove filling .",
    "the triplet flux phase is also one of the leading instabilities for various values of next - nearest - neighbors hopping @xmath1 and certain region of electron concentrations . at @xmath144 and",
    "the van hove filling the leading instabilities are a @xmath177 wave pomeranchuk instability and @xmath6-wave particle - hole instability in triplet channel ( phase of magnetic currents ) at temperatures @xmath192 , and @xmath7-magnetic phase for @xmath183 .",

    "we have found other weaker instabilities also .",
    "most instabilities develop at @xmath205 , which are not small values . therefore , flow equation calculations beyond second order would be desirable . nevertheless , as we have found most commonly discussed types of order , and",
    "since some effects obtained in the intermediate to strong couplings are reproduced reasonably well by means of the flow equations , we suggest that our calculations give an estimate of the most important instabilities .",
