    "@xcite showed that milky way ( mw ) globular clusters ( gcs ) exhibit a correlation between the logarithmic ratio of their tidal @xmath3 and core @xmath4 radii , called the concentration parameter @xmath5 log(@xmath6 ) , and the slope of the low - mass stellar global mass function ( mf ) @xmath0 .",
    "that is , high concentration clusters tend to have steep mfs , while low concentration clusters tend to have flat mfs .",
    "the authors posited that this goes against the naive expectation that it is solely two - body relaxation that drives the evolution of both the concentration and the mf slope .",
    "in particular , two - body relaxation causes the preferential evaporation of low - mass stars across the tidal boundary , while at the same time driving clusters toward a state of higher central density ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it follows that more concentrated clusters should be more severely depleted of preferentially low - mass stars and have a shallower mf than low - concentration clusters .",
    "this is precisely the opposite of what was found by @xcite for a sample of 20 mw gcs .",
    "clearly , the observed correlation between concentration and mf slope is puzzling .",
    "several authors have suggested mechanisms to explain this curious trend .",
    "@xcite offered that gcs severely depleted of their low - mass stars underwent core collapse some time in the past , and have since recovered a normal radial density profile .",
    "however , this can not explain the high concentrations observed in very massive clusters .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the observed correlation could be due to residual gas explusion from initially mass segregated clusters , combined with the effects of unresolved binaries .",
    "the authors argued that extreme gas expulsion could produce clusters with low central densities , and hence low concentrations , and flat pdmfs at the low - mass end .",
    "studying the interplay between the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , concentration , and gas retention plays a crucial role in understanding the origins of star clusters in the milky way .",
    "for example , this approach leads to constraints on the sequence of events during the early evolution of the proto - galaxy @xcite , on the variation of the imf in star bursts @xcite and on the initial mass - radius relation of star clusters @xcite , and on the observed distribution of gc metallicities @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the cluster - to - cluster variations observed in the pdmfs of mw gcs are consistent with what is expected if gcs were born with a universal initial mass function ( imf ) , and two - body relaxation is the dominant physical process driving the evolution of the mf . in other words ,",
    "the power - law index of the central mf @xmath0 increases ( i.e. the mf flattens ) smoothly with decreasing cluster mass .",
    "this is what is expected from two - body relaxation , since it segregates low - mass stars to the outskirts where they escape from the cluster across the tidal boundary , and it operates with a rate that increases with decreasing cluster mass .",
    "this suggests that whatever mechanism is responsible for the observed correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath0 , it should have primarily affected the cluster concentration relative to what is expected from two - body relaxation alone , as opposed to the slope of the mf @xmath0 .",
    "said another way , if two - body relaxation is the only mechanism driving the internal evolution of clusters , then the expected dependence of @xmath0 on the total cluster mass is roughly consistent with what is observed .",
    "this is not the case for the cluster concentration , however .",
    "other observational correlations have been reported for mw gcs , some of which are arguably also consistent with the general picture that gcs were born with approximately universal initial conditions and evolved via dynamics to their present - day forms .",
    "for example , @xcite recently performed a detailed study of the properties of main - sequence binaries in a sample of 59 gcs .",
    "the authors confirmed a previously reported @xcite anti - correlation between the binary fraction and the total cluster mass .",
    "@xcite showed via analytic methods that such an anti - correlation can arise naturally assuming an universal initial binary fraction that is independent of cluster mass .",
    "this can be explained by the disruption of binaries in the cluster core , combined with the evaporation of single stars from the cluster outskirts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the efficiency of the former should increase with increasing cluster density @xcite and hence mass , whereas the efficiency of the latter is driven by two - body relaxation and should increase with decreasing cluster mass .",
    "this contributes to high binary fractions in low - mass clusters , and low binary fractions in high - mass clusters .",
    "notwithstanding , @xcite cautioned that , based on existing observations of binary fractions in galactic gcs , the data is also consistent with significant variations among the initial binary properties",
    ". this would , however , contradict the well - motivated universality hypothesis @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we argue that the origin of the observed distribution of concentration parameters @xmath7 in gcs must be connected to the gas - embedded phase of cluster formation .",
    "the alternative is that globular clusters emerged from the embedded phase with universal initial conditions , and evolved via dynamics to their presently observed mfs and structural parameters .",
    "we perform a suite of numerical simulations for comparison to the observed c-@xmath0 relation , varying the initial conditions in each model in order to identify those that yield the best agreement with the observations at the present - day cluster age .",
    "we also compare the simulated distribution of binary fractions as a function of the total cluster luminosity to the observed relation of @xcite in an effort to constrain to first - order the universality of the initial binary fraction in gcs .",
    "we begin by considering in section  [ dyn - sinks ] different initial conditions that could affect the evolution of the mf slope and/or the concentration parameter . in section  [ models ] , we describe the specific initial conditions we consider , as well as the monte carlo and @xmath1-body models used to simulate the cluster evolution .",
    "we present our results in section  [ results ] and , based on these results , we argue in section  [ discussion ] that dynamics alone could not have reproduced the observed @xmath8 relation .",
    "this implies that the observed relation must have originated very early on in the cluster lifetime , when gas was still present in significant quantities .",
    "hence , we discuss the various mechanisms that could have contributed to the observed distribution of concentration parameters during the gas - embedded phase , and constrain the necessary conditions .",
    "we conclude in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we consider several different dynamical mechanisms that could affect the evolution of the mf slope and/or the cluster concentration . we further describe the initial conditions for which each of these mechanisms should contribute to the observed c-@xmath0 relation .",
    "soft binaries are characterized by their orbital energy , which must have an absolute value that is less than the average single star kinetic energy .",
    "this inequality gives @xcite : @xmath10 where a@xmath11 denotes the semi - major axis of a soft binary , @xmath12 is the average stellar mass , and @xmath13 is the velocity dispersion . if a soft binary experiences a direct encounter with a single star , the total energy of such an encounter is positive , and the binary will likely be disrupted .",
    "thus , on average , the disruption of a soft binary by a single star serves to reduce the interloper s speed , and hence kinetic energy .",
    "if enough soft binaries are disrupted , this could affect the distribution of stellar velocities in a cluster .",
    "the cooling of a cluster through binary star disruption was first demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the initial energy in soft binaries can be up to 10% of the total mechanical energy of a cluster .",
    "the authors argued that this is a sufficiently significant energy sink to drive a typical mw gc to core collapse .",
    "the disruption of soft binaries also causes a decrease in the binary fraction , not only due to the destruction of binaries but also due to the increase in single stars .",
    "this sudden increase in the number of single stars further contributes to increasing the relaxation time by increasing the total number of objects and decreasing the average object mass .",
    "having said that , most soft binaries are disrupted very early on in the cluster lifetime , when massive stars are still present .",
    "the stellar evolution - driven mass loss from massive stars contributes to heating the core , causing the core radius to expand .",
    "the question is : does this tend to outweigh the energy sink provided by soft binaries , so that their disruption only serves to slow the expansion of the core ?",
    "the semi - major axis corresponding to the hard - soft boundary decreases with increasing cluster mass , since the velocity dispersion increases with increasing cluster mass ( see equation  [ eqn : hard - soft ] ) .",
    "thus , assuming an universal initial binary fraction that is independent of the cluster mass , more massive clusters have more soft binaries initially @xcite .",
    "it follows that the efficiency of soft binary disruption as an energy sink should increase with increasing cluster mass .",
    "in other words , for a universal initial binary fraction and orbital parameter distributions , the disruption of soft binaries should contribute to a correlation between the total cluster mass and the concentration parameter , as observed .",
    "hard binaries , for which the absolute value of the orbital energy exceeds the average kinetic energy of a single star , can also influence the central concentration via `` binary burning '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the central density is sufficiently high that even very close binaries , for which the collisional cross - section is small , frequently undergo dynamical interactions with single stars . here",
    ", the binary imparts additional kinetic energy to the escaping single star , becoming even harder in the process @xcite .",
    "thus , hard binaries can act as heat sources in clusters with sufficiently high central densities , slowing and even reversing the tendency toward core collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for a given binary fraction",
    ", low - mass clusters should contain the largest number of hard binaries , since the hard - soft boundaries in these clusters correspond to large orbital separations . hence , core expansion driven by hard binary burning",
    "should also contribute to a correlation between the cluster mass and concentration .",
    "@xcite argued that most milky way gcs have not yet reached sufficiently high central densities to enter the binary burning phase of evolution , although the authors assumed that the concentration was lower in the past and that it has been increasing steadily over time .",
    "clusters with very high initial concentrations , on the other hand , are more likely to undergo binary burning early on , and this can contribute to decreasing the concentration parameter @xcite .",
    "star clusters expand self - similarly in a tidal field @xcite .",
    "this contributes to decreasing the concentration parameter or , more accurately , reducing the rate at which the concentration increases due to two - body relaxation .",
    "this effect occurs in clusters that are initially tidally under - filling , since they have room to expand and experience a long delay before losing mass across the tidal boundary .",
    "once a cluster fills its tidal radius , it experiences a steady increase in its concentration as the core radius shrinks due to two - body relaxation .    assuming a universal distribution of initial cluster sizes , it is the most massive clusters that should expand the most in an under - filled tidal field , since they have the largest tidal radii .",
    "a useful , albeit simplistic @xcite , approximation for the tidal radius is @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the galactocentric distance of the cluster assuming a circular orbit , @xmath16 is the cluster mass , and @xmath17 is the mass of the galaxy , which here we assume to be a point mass .",
    "two - body relaxation acts to move lower mass stars outward to the cluster outskirts , where they preferentially escape across the tidal boundary .",
    "a cluster that experiences a stronger tidal field will undergo a more rapid stripping of its low - mass stars , due to the deeper potential in which the cluster sits and also the fact that a stronger tidal field translates into a smaller tidal radius . as the cluster loses mass ,",
    "the process is accelerated , since the tidal radius decreases and the rate of two - body relaxation increases .",
    "for clusters with small galactocentric distances , this can even result in an inversion of the mass function , so that its slope changes sign @xcite .",
    "tidal heating acts only on clusters with eccentric orbits , since a non - static tidal field implies that the depth of the gravitational potential is periodic , and additional energy is deposited within the stellar population with each perigalactic pass .",
    "this accelerates the rate of escape of preferentially low - mass stars across the tidal boundary .",
    "this is because low - mass stars in the outskirts have the lowest binding energies , so the additional energy accelerates these stars to speeds that exceed the escape velocity , at which point they have a positive total energy and become unbound .",
    "overall , the net effect of tidal heating is to accelerate stars , causing an expansion of the cluster and its more rapid dissolution .",
    "importantly , the mean mass loss per unit time due to external perturbations from the galaxy are independent of cluster mass @xcite .",
    "thus , tidal heating should contribute to the observed dependence of mass function slope on concentration , since , for a given orbit , it should produce more extended clusters with shallower mf slopes for smaller initial cluster masses , in agreement with the observations .",
    "the initial mass function can affect the evolution of the cluster structure in a number of ways .",
    "for example , for a given cluster mass , the initial mass function determines both the total number of stars and the average stellar mass , and hence the rate of two - body relaxation .",
    "mass loss due to stellar evolution tends to cause clusters to expand ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , clusters with a top - heavy initial mass function should expand more due to stellar evolution than clusters with a bottom - heavy initial mass function , since the former includes a larger fraction of massive stars .",
    "a top - heavy imf should also generate more stellar remnants early on in the cluster lifetime , since the stellar lifetime decreases with increasing stellar mass .",
    "stellar remnants , including white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes , represent an unseen component of globular clusters . assuming a standard initial mass function @xcite",
    ", they could constitute a substantial fraction of the total cluster mass at an age of @xmath18 gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , remnants make up a much larger fraction of the _ core _ mass , since they are primarily confined to the central cluster region .",
    "this is because , at the time of their formation , stellar remnants descend from the most massive stars in the cluster , which have typically migrated into the core via mass segregation by the time of their death , if they did not form their in the first place . even in very massive clusters for which the rate of two - body relaxation and hence mass segregation is slower",
    ", remnants that do not form in the core will still quickly migrate there via two - body relaxation since , after a few hundred myr , they are the most massive objects in the cluster .",
    "given that they represent a significant , but unseen , mass component within the core , stellar remnants can have an important bearing on the concentration parameter .",
    "in particular , remnants should act as an additional heat source within the core , and we expect this to contribute to an increase in the core radius , and hence a decrease in the concentration parameter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar remnants could contribute ( weakly ) to the observed c-@xmath0 relation .",
    "this is because , for a larger cluster mass , more massive stars are more likely to be selected from random sampling , and there is evidence that the maximum imf mass increases with increasing cluster mass @xcite .",
    "more massive stars implies more massive remnants , which are more effective at heating the core , and hence lowering the concentration .",
    "it follows that , for a given imf , stellar remnants could be more effective heat sources in more massive clusters , contributing to an anti - correlation between the cluster mass and concentration .",
    "thus , although the data are consistent with a universal imf in milky way globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the stellar imf could compete against the observed c-@xmath0 relation indirectly via stellar remnants .",
    "we do not expect this effect to typically be significant , however , given its stochastic nature , as reflected in the construction of the imf via random sampling .",
    "one interesting example that depends sensitively on the initial stellar and remnant mass functions involves the formation of an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "an imbh can form from the runaway collisions of massive stars very early on in the cluster lifetime @xcite .",
    "the imbh can then continue to grow via subsequent mergers , and even gas accretion mediated by binary star evolution .",
    "if an imbh forms , its presence should contribute to increasing the core radius , and hence decreasing the concentration parameter , by accelerating stars in its immediate vicinity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if imbhs in gcs follow a similar scaling law as super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) in galactic nuclei @xcite , then we would expect more massive clusters to harbour more massive imbhs . in this case",
    ", imbhs would contribute to a trend in which the concentration parameter decreases with increasing cluster mass , in clear disagreement with the observations .",
    "in this section , we describe the monte carlo and @xmath1-body codes used to simulate the cluster evolution , and list the initial conditions we consider .",
    "we use the monte carlo code mocca to simulate the majority of our model clusters , given its fast and robust coverage of the relevant parameter space .",
    "the agreement between mocca and @xmath1-body models is excellent for the case of static galactic tides @xcite , however mocca can not treat non - static tides .",
    "thus , we use the @xmath1-body code nbody6 to quantify the impact of galactic tides on the observed @xmath8 relation , since it incorporates a realistic treatment of the galactic potential .",
    "we use the mocca code to produce the majority of our simulated clusters .",
    "it combines the monte carlo technique for cluster evolution with the _ fewbody _ code @xcite to perform numerical scattering experiments of small - number gravitational interactions , and relies on the binary stellar evolution ( bse ) code to track both stellar and binary evolution @xcite .",
    "the mocca code offers several advantages , in particular the fast computation times required to run the simulations to completion .",
    "it also allows us to simulate clusters in regions of parameter space that are intractable with @xmath1-body codes .",
    "specifically , since it relies on monte carlo methods , it can simulate realistic globular clusters composed of more than a million stars , and it can do so for 12 + gyr of cluster evolution on time - scales of hours in real - time .",
    "10@xmath19 stars typically take @xmath20 1 hour to complete , those with 3 @xmath21 10@xmath22 stars take 10 - 16 hours , and those with 1.8 @xmath21 10@xmath23 stars take 120 - 160 hours .",
    "the precise simulation run - time depends on the choice of initial conditions . ] for more detailed information about the mocca code , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume a king density profile with initial concentration w@xmath24 .",
    "our clusters are not mass segregated to begin with , and all models are initially tidally under - filling . the degree of under - filling is set by the parameter f@xmath25 r@xmath26/r@xmath27 , where r@xmath26 and r@xmath27 are the tidal and half - mass radii , respectively .",
    "to put this parameter into context , a king model @xcite with w@xmath24 has a ratio between the tidal and half - mass radii of f@xmath28 .",
    "we adopt a metallicity of @xmath29 for all models .",
    "the initial conditions we consider are shown in table  [ table : initial - mc ] .",
    "we vary the initial mass function , binary fraction , kick velocities for nss and bhs upon formation , the initial - final mass relation for bhs , the total number of stars , the ratio r@xmath26/r@xmath27 , and the cluster age .",

    "consequently , clusters exposed to stronger tidal fields undergo the most rapid flattening of their mfs ( i.e. the greatest rate of decrease in @xmath0 ) , since low - mass stars are preferentially accelerated to wider orbits within the cluster potential .",
    "this mass loss translates into a reduction in the time - scale for two - body relaxation .",
    "the shorter relaxation time exacerbates the trend , so that more mass is lost from the cluster at an ever - increasing rate , shortening the relaxation time even further .",

    "galactic tides affect the evolution of the cluster concentration in the following way .",

    "this trend sets in within roughly the first gyr of evolution , and becomes exacerbated as the clusters continue to evolve .",
    "this is because clusters with small galactocentric distances ( and hence small tidal radii ) have the least room to expand before filling their tidal radii .",
    "once these clusters are tidally - filling , their core and half - mass radii begin to contract due to two - body relaxation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "_ although r@xmath58 and r@xmath27 themselves change significantly , the ratio r@xmath27/r@xmath58 remains roughly the same for all clusters_. this is clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : nbody2 ] for all simulated clusters , almost independent of their orbit through the galaxy .",
    "that is , for model clusters with the same initial size and concentration the evolution in c@xmath27 appears to be orbit - independent in figure  [ fig : nbody2 ] , with c@xmath27 increasing from 0.8 to almost 1 after a hubble time .",
    "any differences are within the observational uncertainties .",

    "we make use of lower mass versions of our @xmath1-body models .",
    "these lower mass models contain 48000 single stars and 2000 binaries initially , and are described in detail in @xcite . due to their smaller masses , these models are less computationally expensive , which allows us to explore a range of initial half - mass radii . for clusters with initial half - mass radii of 2 pc and 4 pc , the central concentration increases while the cluster expands to fill its tidal radius ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) , and @xmath0 remains roughly constant .",
    "this results in tidally under - filling clusters evolving towards the high - c@xmath27 , high-@xmath0 region of figure  [ fig : c - alpha - obs ] .",
    "once the tidal radius is filled , @xmath0 decreases at a rate similar to that in the models shown in figure  [ fig : nbody2 ] , while maintaining a near constant half - mass concentration c@xmath27 .",
    "however , in _ very _ tidally under - filling clusters at large galactocentric distances , 12 gyr may not be enough time to enter this phase of evolution .",
    "thus , although we are unable to reproduce the highest concentrations observed by @xcite , initially very tidally under - filling clusters tend to produce the highest final concentrations .",
    "_ these results suggest that galactic tides should contribute to , and likely even dominate , the dispersion in the observed c@xmath46 relation .",
    "_ most of this dispersion should appear at the low - concentration ( and typically low - mass ) end of the distribution , since these include both initially massive , heavily stripped clusters at small galactocentric distances and initially low - mass clusters at large galactocentric distances that have lost only a small fraction of their mass . this can help to account for some of the dispersion in @xmath0 at the low - c@xmath27 end not reproduced in our models , as seen in figure  [ fig : c - alpha - obs ] .",
    "more quantitatively , the smallest galactocentric distance in the sample of @xcite is @xmath71 kpc and @xmath0 does not evolve significantly at galactocentric distances beyond @xmath72 kpc .",
    "hence , at the low - concentration end of the distribution , we estimate from figure  [ fig : nbody2 ] that tides should contribute to a dispersion in @xmath0 of @xmath73 _ for a given initial cluster mass_. this value of @xmath74 is a minimum , since the clusters plotted in figure  [ fig : nbody2 ] all began with the same initial total mass .",

    "the presently observed range is @xmath75 ( from -1.0 up to 2.0 ) .",
    "given the range of initial cluster masses and galactocentric distances that should apply to the sample of @xcite , we conclude that galactic tides dominate the dispersion in the observed distribution of present - day mf slopes .",
    "we note that tides contribute significantly to altering the _ global _ mass function , however the effect is much less pronounced for the central mf evaluated near the core ( see webb et al .",

    "this is because the _ central _ mf is primarily altered via two - body relaxation - driven mass segregation , and is relatively insensitive to the escape of stars across the tidal boundary .",
    "this explains why the results presented in @xcite , which focused on the annulus immediately outside the core ( between one and two core radii from the cluster centre ) , are consistent with the general picture that the cluster - to - cluster differences observed in the pdmfs of gcs arise from an universal imf modified primarily by two - body relaxation - driven dynamical evolution .",

    "as illustrated by the black ( 10 gyr ) , red ( 11 gyr ) and blue ( 12 gyr ) squares in figure  [ fig : rem ] , the slope of the mf tends to decrease over time .",
    "clusters with the lowest masses ( i.e. @xmath51 ; shown by the smallest point - size in figure  [ fig : rem ] ) end up with the smallest mf slopes , in qualitative agreement with the observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "more quantitatively , figure  [ fig : c - alpha - obs ] shows that models that assume a standard kroupa imf struggle to reproduce clusters with sufficiently low-@xmath0 and low - concentration , as was found by @xcite for the gc palomar 14 .",
    "the agreement is slightly better in models that assume a non - standard imf , as shown by the solid red triangles and squares in figure  [ fig : c - alpha - obs ] .",
    "however , this is only because the non - standard imf has more massive stars , which lose the most mass due to stellar evolution , and this contributes to an expansion of the core .",
    "thus , the final concentration is smaller for a non - standard imf due to the additional mass loss from massive stars very early on in the cluster evolution . as mentioned , we confirm that the half - light concentration tends to increase over time , however this need not always be the case .",
    "for example , stellar evolution causes an expansion of the core very early on in the cluster lifetime , and the concentration can change from increasing to decreasing during the final stages of cluster dissolution .",
    "more importantly , _ there is a stochasticity in the simulations such that nearly identical initial conditions can produce significantly different final evolutionary states for our model clusters . _    as illustrated in figure  [ fig : rem ] , most of the stochasticity observed in our monte carlo simulations seems to be tied to the dynamical evolution of the remnant sub - population within the cluster . for example , in some of our models , an imbh forms through a new pathway not yet discussed in the literature ( for more details , see giersz , leigh & hypki 2013 , in preparation ) . in this scenario , an imbh forms from a single originally stellar - mass black hole that grows in mass due to dynamical interactions that induce mergers between the growing bh and ( typically ) other stellar remnants , combined with binary evolution - driven mass - transfer events . to initiate this process ,",
    "one bh must be left in the system after all bh - forming supernovae have ceased , or a single bh must be formed via ns - ns or ns - wd mergers .",
    "the presence of additional bhs tends to prevent the formation of a single very massive bh due to competitive merging and accretion , followed by their dynamical ejection from the cluster .",
    "the process is facilitated by the fact that the growing bh is rarely isolated , since the time - scale for it to capture another object and form a binary is very short .",
    "the presence of such a binary companion is crucial , since it reduces the time - scale for dynamical interactions and hence mergers . in our standard models ,",
    "the mass growth of the bh is typically slow and requires a few gyr of cluster evolution before an imbh forms .",
    "the final core radius is typically higher in these models than in those for which no imbh forms .",
    "therefore , our results show that remnants can also contribute to the dispersion in the observed c-@xmath0 relation . based on the results shown in figure  [ fig : rem ]",

    "in this section , we argue that stellar dynamics alone is not enough to reproduce the observed c@xmath46 relation . while the effects of two - body relaxation combined with galactic tides _ can _ reproduce the observed dispersion in @xmath0 @xcite , we do not find a strong increase in the concentration parameter with increasing cluster mass , and hence increasing @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , in our models , regardless of the initial ( universal ) conditions and assumptions adopted .",
    "this implies that some other non - dynamical mechanism is also required to reproduce the observed distribution of concentration parameters .",

    "this is because our simulated clusters struggle to _ simultaneously _ produce both high - concentration high-@xmath0 and low - concentration low-@xmath0 clusters , provided we adopt the same empirically - motivated universal imf for every cluster @xcite .",

    "shifting the initial mass function slope and/or distribution of concentrations in either direction will only worsen the agreement at the opposite end .",
    "for example , if we begin with clusters that are initially more concentrated , we will struggle even more to produce sufficiently low concentration clusters with flat mfs , and vice versa .",

    "instead , we re - iterate that the observed spread in @xmath0 _ can _ be reproduced from an universal imf combined with energy equipartition - driven dynamical evolution @xcite .. this quantitatively reproduces the general trend that lower mass clusters tend to have shallower pdmfs @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the observed spread in c@xmath27 _ can not _ be reproduced from an universal distribution of initial concentrations .",
    "thus , some other mechanism that is independent of the internal dynamical evolution of clusters must also be operating in order to reproduce the ( weak ) trend that higher mass clusters ( with , on average , steeper mfs ) tend to have higher present - day concentrations @xcite .",

    "@xcite argued that tidal dissipation during close fly - bys between single stars can reduce the stars kinetic energies , and contribute to a contraction of the core on a shorter time - scale than is achieved by two - body relaxation alone .",
    "similarly , direct collisions between single stars should also dissipate kinetic energy @xcite . the single - single collision rate increases with increasing cluster mass @xcite , so that the most massive clusters should experience the most efficient tidal dissipation due to close fly - bys and direct collisions between single stars .",
    "thus , tidal interactions and collisions may both contribute to the observed @xmath8 relation , since they both contribute to a correlation between cluster mass and concentration .",
    "a detailed treatment of the effects of collisions and tidal interactions is beyond the scope of this paper , however our results suggest that these effects can likely be ignored in future studies .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : heat - cool ] , the energy sink provided by collisions is never the dominant heating / cooling mechanism affecting the concentration .",
    "in fact , the effect is typically negligible , and remains approximately constant over the cluster lifetime for the central densities reached in our models .",
    "it follows that the energy sink offered by tidal interactions is also unlikely to ever be the dominant heating / cooling mechanism .",
    "this is because the rate of tidal capture events should be comparable to the rate of direct collisions , since the efficiency of tidal capture decreases rapidly with increasing distance of closest approach . also",
    ", tidal interaction events that do not result in binary formation typically remove significantly less energy than tidal captures , since the energy dissipated due to tides quickly becomes negligible with increasing distance of closest approach .      in the previous section , we argued that it is unlikely that the observed c@xmath46 relation has a purely energy equipartition - driven origin .",

    "the results presented in this paper suggest that an even more bottom - heavy imf in the mass range 0.3 - 0.8 m@xmath33 than assumed in our standard model ( imf1 ) , combined with a lower initial half - light concentration , could reproduce the observed c@xmath46 relation at the low - c@xmath27 end .",

    "disc shocking and external perturbations from other massive bodies on nearby orbits within the galaxy could also contribute to this general trend .",

    "@xcite also caution that unresolved binaries can contribute to making the mf index @xmath0 appear smaller than it actually is .",

    "for this to be the case , all that is required is that the `` accreted '' gas be accelerated by the accretor such that the two are co - moving relative to the background medium @xcite . in general , accretion from the interstellar medium",
    "should both increase the central stellar density and accelerate the mass segregation process @xcite , since the accretion rate typically increases with increasing accretor mass .",
    "active star formation also suggests high gas densities .",
    "consequently , gas dynamical friction could be very efficient , since the gas dynamical friction force scales linearly with the gas density .",
    "the net effect of gas dynamical friction is to transfer kinetic energy from the stars to the surrounding gas , causing the central stellar density to increase but the central gas density to decrease .",
    "we note that the gas dynamical friction force also depends critically on whether or not the motion of the perturber relative to the gas is subsonic or supersonic .",
    "given that stars are actively forming during much of the gas - embedded phase , this suggests that the gas must have been relatively cold .",
    "it follows that the sound - speed should have been small compared to the stellar velocity dispersion , and hence that the motion was predominantly supersonic .",
    "the most efficient gas drag occurs when the relative velocity is slightly less than the sound speed @xcite ( i.e. when the stellar and gas velocity dispersions are roughly equal ) , however previous work has also shown it to be effective in the supersonic regime @xcite .",
    "the increase in stellar density due to the presence of gas could result in positive feedback , and help to prolong the gas - embedded phase .",
    "this is because a higher stellar density translates into a deeper potential well , and hence a larger escape velocity .",
    "this could in turn imply a larger gas retention fraction and/or a longer gas expulsion time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if more massive clusters tend to have higher gas densities primordially , retain their gas for longer or re - accrete more gas from the surrounding intra - cluster medium than do low - mass clusters , this could contribute to a correlation between cluster mass and concentration .",
    "this is because , in this case , the efficiencies of both accretion from the ism ( onto stars ) and gas dynamical friction should increase with increasing cluster mass .",
    "we conclude that the gas - embedded phase of cluster evolution could be crucially important for the origin of the observed c@xmath46 relation .",
    "this is not only due to the fact that the results presented in this paper suggest that two - body relaxation - driven dynamical evolution alone can not explain the observed distribution of concentrations , but also because the gas damping mechanisms we have considered should all contribute to the observed trend of increasing concentration with increasing cluster mass .",
    "more work will be needed to better isolate the origin of the observed c@xmath46 relation and , in particular , the degree to which it was present at the end of the gas - embedded phase .",
    "future studies with this goal should aim to constrain the gas - embedded phase of cluster evolution ( e.g. central gas density , gas retention time , etc . ) as a function of the total cluster mass .",
    "in this paper , we consider the origin of the correlation between cluster concentration and present - day mass function slope observed in the milky way globular cluster population . to this end",
    ", we generate a suite of monte carlo and @xmath1-body models using the mocca and nbody6 codes , respectively , for star cluster evolution .",
    "we compare the results to the observed correlation between cluster concentration and mass function slope , as well as to the observed anti - correlation between cluster mass and binary fraction .",
    "these relations can either be reproduced from universal initial conditions combined with some dynamical mechanism(s ) that alter(s ) the distributions over time , or they must arise very early on in the cluster lifetime , such as during the gas - embedded phase of cluster formation . we explore a number of dynamical mechanisms that could contribute to , or even reproduce , the observed trends .",
    "our key conclusions are :    *    galactic tides combined with energy equipartition - driven dynamical evolution can account for most , if not all , of the observed dispersion in the present - day mf slope @xmath0 , but not all of the dispersion in the concentration parameter c@xmath27 .    dynamical effects induced by stellar remnants should also contribute non - negligibly to the dispersion observed in c@xmath27 .",
    "some other mechanism that is independent of the internal dynamical evolution of clusters must also operate in order to reproduce the observed dispersion in c@xmath27 .",
    "whatever the mechanism(s ) responsible , it should operate by preferentially increasing c@xmath27 in more massive clusters in order to reproduce the observed trend that clusters with steep mfs ( and typically large total cluster masses ) tend to have the highest concentrations .",
    "thus , we conclude that energy equipartition - driven dynamical evolution alone could not have reproduced the observed relation between concentration and mass function slope .",
    "consequently , we suggest that this trend could be connected to the gas - embedded phase of cluster evolution . specifically , we argue that cluster contraction due to prolonged gas retention could account for the most concentrated clusters with the steepest mass functions , and cluster expansion due to rapid gas expulsion could account for the least concentrated clusters with the flattest mass functions .",
    "we would like to thank michael marks and hagai perets for useful discussions , as well as an anonymous referee whose suggestions helped to improve this manuscript .",
