    "such points are often referred to as being @xmath16",
    ".    small instantons also occur in @xmath1-theory on @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a calabi - yau threefold  @xcite .",
    "as first discussed in  @xcite , to be consistent these vacua must have , supported on the calabi - yau manifold at each end of the @xmath0 interval , a gauge instanton indexed by a subgroup of @xmath19 .",
    "one can , for simplicity , assume a trivial instanton at one end of the interval .",
    "the non - trivial instanton on the other end is a connection on a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath20 over @xmath18 with structure group @xmath21 .",
    "quantum consistency requires that the instanton number , here generalized to the 2nd chern class @xmath22 , must satisfy the constraint @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the tangent bundle of the calabi - yau threefold and @xmath25 is an effective class corresponding to m - five - branes in the @xmath26 `` bulk '' space .",

    "its gauge symmetry depends on the choice of structure group @xmath29 . in a series of publications  @xcite ,",

    "these are the heterotic @xmath1-theory analogs of small instantons . here , however , the local moduli spaces @xmath11 are more complicated , changing with the structure of the calabi - yau threefold , the holomorphic vector bundle and the choice of @xmath37 . the moduli spaces of small instantons on elliptic calabi - yau threefolds over hirzebruch bases @xmath38 with vector bundles constructed from spectral covers were analyzed in several publications  @xcite .",
    "for example , consider @xmath39 , @xmath31 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 a section of @xmath42 .",
    "then , it was shown that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are integers satisfying the constraints @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is expected that any @xmath11 can again be described as the flat directions of a potential energy function .",

    "all of these fields become massless and the @xmath49 symmetry becomes exact .",

    "unfortunately , such potential functions have not been explicitly constructed for most moduli spaces .",
    "limited simple examples indicate that such potentials exist , but a general proof is still lacking .",
    "be that as it may , in this paper we will assume that small instanton moduli spaces @xmath15 in heterotic @xmath1-theory can be so described .    in heterotic @xmath1-theory , strings wrapping a holomorphic curve in the calabi - yau threefold will generate a non - perturbative superpotential for both geometric and vector bundle moduli  @xcite . as first discussed in  @xcite",
    ", the superpotential created by a such a `` worldsheet instanton '' has a specific form ; namely , an exponential of geometric and curve moduli multiplied by a `` pfaffian '' .",
    "the pfaffian is a function of the determinant of the dirac operator twisted by the vector bundle restricted to the curve .",
    "it is generically true  @xcite that the pfaffian evaluated at any holomorphic curve is a homogeneous polynomial of the moduli of the restricted bundle .",
    "this has important implications for small instantons .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the moduli of the vector bundle restricted to the small instanton curve @xmath36 are precisely those which parameterize @xmath11 .",
    "hence , strings wrapped on @xmath36 generate a superpotential on @xmath11 which `` lifts''some , or all , of the flat directions .",
    "furthermore , new local minima may now occur substantially away from the @xmath16 at the zero of field space . within the context of @xmath38 , @xmath31 and @xmath50 ,",
    "pfaffians were explicitly computed in  @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the pfaffian was shown to be an explicit homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath55 in @xmath56 of the @xmath57 moduli of @xmath11 .    at a small instanton in heterotic @xmath1-theory",
    ", the vector bundle @xmath20 degenerates into the `` union '' of a new holomorphic vector bundle @xmath58 over @xmath18 and a sheaf over the curve @xmath36 . because of the existence of the @xmath26 interval",
    ", the sheaf can `` detach '' from @xmath18 , leaving only @xmath58 behind , and become a component of a new m - five - brane curve in the bulk space .",
    "that is , @xmath59 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this is that the small instanton `` emits '' a five - brane into the bulk space . of course",
    ", this can occur in reverse , a component @xmath59 of a bulk space five - brane being `` absorbed '' into @xmath58 via a small instanton to become @xmath20 .",
    "such a process , either absorbing or emitting a bulk five - brane , is called a small instanton phase transition and was defined and studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that there are two types of small instanton transitions , the first in which the structure group of the vector bundle is unchanged while the number of chiral zero modes is altered and a second where the reverse is true , the structure group changes while the number of chiral zero modes remains fixed . for an elliptically fibered calabi - yau threefold @xmath18 ,",
    "the first type of transition occurs when @xmath36 is the pull - back of a curve in the base @xmath60 .",
    "this is analogous to the heterotic @xmath2 case .",
    "the second type of transition takes place when @xmath36 is proportional to the elliptic fiber @xmath61 . in this paper",
    ", we will consider only those small instanton transition for which the structure group is unchanged .",
    "an important aspect of any small instanton transition is that the @xmath1-five - brane wrapped on @xmath36 in the bulk space itself has moduli .",
    "the most conspicuous of these is the translation modulus , the real part of which describes the separation of the five - brane from the end of the @xmath62 interval and whose imaginary part is an axion .",
    "for a calabi - yau threefold @xmath18 elliptically fibered over any base @xmath60 , the complete moduli space @xmath63 of an @xmath1-five - brane wrapped on @xmath36 , both its dimension and geometry , was computed in  @xcite .",
    "this space depends strongly on the curve @xmath36 and typically contains many moduli in addition to the translation modulus . combining this with the discussion above",
    ", we see that in heterotic @xmath1-theory the full moduli space of a small instanton phase transition is @xmath64 , where @xmath11 is the instanton phase and @xmath63 the five - brane phase . generalizing the above discussion",
    ", we assume that the complete phase transition can be described by a potential energy function constructed from chiral supermultiplets in some representation @xmath47 of @xmath29 and , possibly , in a representation @xmath48 of an additional gauge symmetry @xmath49 . the origin of field space is an @xmath16 . away from this point , however , the @xmath49 symmetry is spontaneously broken and only the moduli parameterizing @xmath65 remain massless .",
    "the existence of small instanton phase transitions , from the point of view of holomorphic vector bundles and topology , was demonstrated in  @xcite . in the present paper , by studying the motion of heterotic @xmath1-theory vacua in moduli space coupled to an expanding friedmann - robinson - walker ( frw ) spacetime , we will show that these phase transition can also take place dynamically .",
    "specifically , we will show that an @xmath1-five - brane in the bulk can dynamically evolve through the esp , the point in moduli space where the five - brane collides with the end of the @xmath66 interval , continuing until the vacuum comes to rest at a local minimum of the non - perturbative superpotential . at this point , which is substantially distant from the esp ,",
    "the sheaf over @xmath36 has combined with @xmath58 to form a smooth vector bundle @xmath20 , completing the small instanton phase transition .",
    "the dynamical system is trapped at this local minimum by the hubble friction of the frw space .",
    "we ignore the effect of moduli trapping due to radiation into massless fields at the esp  @xcite , but will argue that this is insufficient to alter our results .",
    "our results are consistent with those found , in different contexts , in  @xcite .",
    "these papers ignore any non - perturbative potentials that might arise and discuss flat moduli space .",
    "they find that the moduli are trapped , both by hubble friction and quantum radiation , exactly at the esp , which , they go on to argue , gives it a special physical meaning .",
    "we note that were we to turn off the non - perturbative superpotential in heterotic @xmath1-theory , one would arrive at precisely the same conclusion .",
    "however , turning on this potential completely alters this result and allows the completion of the small instanton phase transition .    throughout this paper , for notational and computational simplicity",
    ", we will take all fields to be dimensionless and choose units in which @xmath67 .",
    "in this section , we consider the dynamics of small instanton transitions ignoring the non - perturbative superpotential generated by worldsheet instantons . in this case",
    ", the moduli space @xmath65 is the flat locus of the potential .",
    "as discussed above , the dimension and geometry of this moduli space is completely understood , at least for a wide range of base spaces @xmath60 and small instanton curves @xmath36 .",
    "however , @xmath11 and @xmath63 are both , generically , multi - dimensional . for example , the small instanton discussed in the introduction had @xmath11 parameterized by @xmath57 complex fields .",
    "unfortunately , a detailed calculation of dynamics in a multi - dimensional moduli space is not only unenlightening in its complexity , but is far beyond our computational power . for this reason",
    ", we will restrict our discussion to a simplified moduli space , one in which both @xmath11 and @xmath63 are taken to be one - dimensional .",
    "we denote the complex modulus of @xmath11 , the instanton phase , by @xmath68 .",
    "physically , this modulus describes the `` smoothing out '' of the small instanton sheaf into the smooth vector bundle @xmath20 .",
    "the complex modulus of @xmath63 , the five - brane phase , is written as @xmath69 and represents the translation modulus of the five - brane .",
    "we want to emphasize that the literature describing transitions in different contexts  @xcite all employ very similar simplifications .",
    "we begin by considering the dynamics of the moduli @xmath69 and @xmath68 in static flat spacetime ; that is , we turn off their interaction with gravity .",
    "the simplest @xmath28 supersymmetric self - interactions that have precisely a one - dimension instanton phase and a one - dimension five - brane phase are described by the superpotential @xmath70 recall that both @xmath69 and @xmath68 are taken to be dimensionless and , hence , @xmath71 has mass dimensions @xmath72 in planck units .",
    "furthermore , we choose the planck mass @xmath73 to be unity .",
    "the potential function describing the small instanton phase transition is then given by @xmath74 the instanton phase is the one - dimensional complex submanifold defined by @xmath75 , whereas the five - brane phase is the one - dimensional space given by @xmath76 .",
    "the dynamical calculation is carried out in the four - dimensional real space parameterized by @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . without loss of generality , one can take @xmath81 .",
    "other values of @xmath71 lead to the same conclusions . in this paper , we will assume that the calabi - yau radius and the interval length are chosen , in units where @xmath67 , to be in the phenomenologically acceptable range @xmath82 this implies that in order to achieve the correct phenomenological values for the newton and gauge coupling parameters , the dimensionless volume and interval moduli should be stabilized at ( or be slowly rolling near ) the values of order one . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that this is the case .",
    "this limits @xmath69 to be less than or of the order of unity . for reasons to become clear in the next subsection , we will choose both @xmath69 and @xmath68 moduli to have values much smaller than one .",
    "let us compute the dynamics with the following initial conditions .",
    "take the initial moduli to be @xmath83 and their initial velocities as @xmath84 these values represent the following physical situation .",
    "first , there is a five - brane in the bulk space substantially separated from the end of the @xmath0 interval with a much smaller displacement in the axionic direction .",
    "a similar very small displacement occurs in the vector bundle modulus .",
    "the five - brane has a small negative velocity in the @xmath85 direction which will cause it to collide with the end of the interval and a similar velocity in the axion direction .",
    "substantially larger velocities are given to both @xmath86 and @xmath87 which enable a possible transition from the five - brane branch to the instanton branch .",
    "the equations of motion are solved numerically on mathematica , with the results for @xmath85 and @xmath87 presented in figures 1 and 2 .    curve ( a ) in figure 1 shows that the five - brane collides with the end of the interval but then continues to oscillate around that point .",
    "similarly , curve ( b ) shows that the collision initiates a transition in the vector bundle modulus direction which , however , quickly terminates .",
    "the resulting motion is an oscillation around the small instanton in the vector bundle direction as well .",
    "figure 2 shows the overall motion in moduli space near the small instanton at the origin of field space .",
    "note that although the amplitude of any individual real modulus increases and decreases quasi - periodically , the overall amplitude remains constant in time , as is clearly indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the dynamics of the remaining two real moduli , @xmath88 and @xmath86 , is similar , so we will not display them .",
    "these results are easy to explain .",
    "first of all , in both the five - brane and instanton branches , the potential energy function has walls which become progressively steeper as one moves away from the origin of field space .",
    "hence , the moving moduli see a `` concave '' potential that always reflects them back toward the origin .",
    "this accounts for the oscillation around the small instanton at the origin of field space .",
    "secondly , the lack of any damping , be it hubble friction or any other mechanism , means that the overall oscillation amplitude persists .",
    "the final conclusion is that the phase transition is never completed .",
    "instead the system oscillates endlessly around the small instanton .",
    "note that these results are consistent with those found in  @xcite when analyzing undamped motion in different contexts .",
    "let us now consider the moduli @xmath69 and @xmath68 interacting with gravity . in this case",
    ", the dynamics is described by @xmath28 chiral multiplets coupled to supergravity and one must specify both a superpotential @xmath89 and a kahler potential @xmath90 .",
    "the superpotential remains the same , namely @xmath91 in general , the kahler potential of moduli in heterotic @xmath1-theory is unknown .",
    "however , near the origin of field space , that is , when the magnitudes of the moduli are much smaller than unity , this can be taken to be `` flat '' .",
    "therefore , as long as we restrict @xmath69 and @xmath68 describing our small instanton phase transition to be small , the kahler potential is given by @xmath92 this is one reason why we chose the initial conditions for @xmath69 and @xmath68 in the previous subsection to be much less than one .",
    "the potential function describing the small instanton phase transition is now @xmath93 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are given in  ( [ 5 ] ) and  ( [ 6 ] ) respectively and @xmath94 is the kahler covariant derivative .",
    "this is a rather complicated function of the moduli .",
    "however , for @xmath69 and @xmath68 much smaller than unity , one need only consider the lowest order interactions .",
    "all terms that are higher order in @xmath95 can safely be ignored .",
    "the result is that one can analyze the dynamics with the same potential as in the non - gravitational case , that is , @xmath96 as previously , we will choose @xmath81 and only consider the region of moduli space where @xmath69 and @xmath68 are much smaller than one .",
    "additionally , one must give an ansatz for the spacetime geometry .",
    "we will assume a metric of the form @xmath97 corresponding to a spatially flat manifold of the frw type .    furthermore , we will only consider metrics that are monotonically expanding .",
    "there are , in total , five equations of motion that must be solved simultaneously . to begin with",
    ", there is a single einstein equation for the scale parameter @xmath98 .",
    "additionally , there are the four equations of motion for the real and imaginary parts of the moduli @xmath69 and @xmath68 . despite the fact that the potential in  ( [ 8 ] ) is independent of gravitationally induced interactions , non - trivial gravity effects do enter each equation as a hubble damping term .",
    "let us compute the dynamics with the following initial conditions .",
    "take the initial value of the scale parameter to be @xmath99 it is unnecessary to fix an initial radial velocity .",
    "we will continue to choose the initial conditions for the @xmath69 and @xmath68 moduli and their velocities to be those given in  ( [ 3 ] ) and  ( [ 4 ] ) respectively .",
    "these values represent exactly the same physical situation as in the previous subsection . here , however , the moduli evolve with respect to an expanding frw background spacetime",
    ". the equations of motion are solved numerically on mathematica .",
    "the result for the scale parameter @xmath98 is shown in figure 3 , while those for @xmath85 and @xmath87 are presented in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "figure 3 shows that @xmath98 increases monotonically from its initial value , indicating an expanding frw universe .    from curve ( a ) in figure 4",
    ", one sees that the five - brane collides with the end of the interval and then continues to oscillate around that point .",
    "however , the average amplitude and frequency of the oscillation are now strongly damped in time , with @xmath85 converging toward zero .",
    "similarly , curve ( b ) in figure 4 shows that the collision initiates a transition into the vector bundle modulus direction which then terminates , reverses and begins to oscillates around @xmath100 .",
    "once again , the average amplitude and frequency of the oscillation in the vector bundle modulus direction are damped in time and @xmath87 converges to zero .",
    "figure 5 shows the overall motion in moduli space near the small instanton at the origin of field space .",
    "note that the overall amplitude decreases in time .",
    "the dynamics of the remaining real moduli , @xmath88 and @xmath86 , is similar , so we do not display them .",
    "the physical explanation of these results is identical to that given in the previous subsection , with one important exception .",
    "the expansion of the universe produces `` friction '' in the motion of the moduli .",
    "this causes their oscillation around the origin of field space to have ever diminishing amplitude and frequency .",
    "the physical conclusion is that after collision and a period of damped oscillation , the five - brane becomes fixed at the end of the interval .",
    "the associated bundle data is the `` union '' of @xmath58 and a torsion free sheaf over the curve @xmath36 .",
    "that is , the system approaches the small instanton @xmath16 and the phase transition to a smooth bundle @xmath20 is never completed .",
    "note that these results are completely consistent with those found in  @xcite when analyzing damped motion in different contexts .",
    "having established our preliminary results , we now turn to the main discussion in this paper ; namely , the dynamics of small instanton transitions in the presence of a non - perturbative superpotential generated by worldsheet instantons . in this case",
    ", the moduli space @xmath63 of the curve remains flat .",
    "however , the potential for the vector bundle moduli is now substantially altered , with the result that , generically , the flat moduli space @xmath11 is replaced by one or more isolated local minima . to proceed , we must first be more explicit about the form of the non - perturbative interactions .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the superpotential generated by a string wrapped on an isolated curve @xmath101 has the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 are a subset of vector bundle moduli and we have assumed , for simplicity , that the moduli space of the five - brane wrapped on @xmath36 is one - dimensional and parameterized by the dimensionless translation modulus @xmath69 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath104 is then dimensionless and given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the size of the @xmath0 interval , @xmath107 is the area of @xmath36 and @xmath108 is the eleven - dimensional planck scale . when the calabi - yau radius and the interval length are chosen , in units where @xmath67 , to be in the phenomenologically acceptable range eq .",
    ", @xmath104 is found  @xcite to be of order @xmath109 .",
    "let us recall that in our notation the position of the five - brane is dimensionless and bounded by the length of the interval which is of order one .    as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath110 is the pfaffian of the dirac operator twisted by the vector bundle @xmath20 restricted to the curve @xmath36 .",
    "it is found to be a homogeneous polynomial of the moduli @xmath103 of the restricted bundle . in general , the pfaffian is difficult to compute .",
    "however , it has been explicitly calculated in  @xcite for vector bundles with structure group @xmath111 restricted to an isolated curve @xmath36 in an elliptic calabi - yau threefold with base @xmath38 .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath51 , a specific @xmath112 vector bundle and @xmath50 , where @xmath41 is an isolated curve in @xmath42 , it was shown that the pfaffian is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath55 in @xmath56 out of the @xmath57 moduli of @xmath11 . an important pattern that emerges from the results in  @xcite",
    "is that the smaller the dimension of @xmath11 , the smaller the degree of the homogeneous polynomial .",
    "a final comment is that the coefficient of proportionality has not been explicitly computed .",
    "now consider the simplified moduli space in which both @xmath11 and @xmath63 are one - dimensional and parameterized by the moduli @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . in this case , the non - perturbative superpotential @xmath113 in  ( [ 11 ] ) takes the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a small integer and @xmath116 is a coefficient of mass dimension @xmath117 in planck units .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the moduli dynamics in the presence of superpotential ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "again consider the dynamics of the moduli @xmath69 and @xmath68 in static flat spacetime .",

    "however , the moduli space @xmath11 is now replaced by @xmath123 isolated points located at @xmath124 where @xmath125 .    to carry out an explicit calculation of the moduli dynamics , one must specify the values of the parameters in superpotential ( [ 15 ] ) . without loss of generality , choose @xmath81 . for specificity",
    ", we will take @xmath126 the choice for @xmath104 is consistent with the phenomenologically acceptable values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 given in  ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "similarly , in view of the discussion above , @xmath129 is a reasonable value for the degree of the pfaffian polynomial .",
    "the choice of @xmath116 in  ( [ 20 ] ) is less well - motivated .",
    "it is taken because it enhances the distance between the local minimum and the esp in moduli space , as can be seen from  ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "for the parameters in  ( [ 20 ] ) , the local minima in  ( [ 19 ] ) become @xmath130 similar physical conclusions will be reached for a wide range of all three parameters .    with these choices ,",
    "we compute the moduli dynamics using initial conditions similar to those given in  ( [ 3 ] ) and  ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the physical situation is identical to that described in the previous section .",
    "the moduli equations of motion are solved numerically on mathematica , with the results for @xmath77 and @xmath80 shown in figure @xmath131 .",
    "figure @xmath132 indicates that the five - brane collides with the end of the interval but then , eventually , continues to oscillate without damping around that point .",
    "now , however , there is a new phenomenon .",
    "note that immediately after the collision the @xmath77 modulus gets `` hung up '' at the negative value corresponding to the local minima in  ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "it lingers there for a considerable time , before rolling back through the origin and continuing its oscillation around the small instanton point .",
    "similar , but more dramatic , behaviour for @xmath80 is shown in figure @xmath133 .",
    "after a few small oscillations around the origin of field space , the @xmath80 modulus rolls all the way out to the value @xmath134 corresponding to one of the local minima in  ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "it stays in the vicinity of this minimum for some time , before rolling back through the origin and beginning an undamped oscillation around the small instanton .",
    "the choice of @xmath134 rather than the other minimum at @xmath135 is due to the initial conditions .",
    "these can be changed to select the other local minimum .",
    "the behaviour of both moduli is graphically presented in figure @xmath136 , where the excursion of the moduli to the local minimum and back is clearly visible .",
    "the other two real moduli , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , simply oscillate with undamped motion around the origin of field space , so we will not display them .    comparing these results with the static flat case in section @xmath137 ,",
    "we conclude that the non - perturbative superpotential has a dramatic effect on the dynamics of the moduli .",
    "specifically , the moduli now evolve far from the origin of field space , seeking , and reaching , an isolated local minimum of the potential .",
    "however , since there is no mechanism for damping , the moduli roll through the isolated minimum , returning to oscillate around the small instanton .",
    "were one to wait for a sufficiently long time , the moduli might once again briefly return to one of the two local minima , only to roll out again and oscillate around the origin of field space .",
    "the lack of any damping means that the overall oscillation amplitude persists .",
    "we conclude that , despite the existence of isolated local minima , the phase transition is never completed .",
    "now let the moduli @xmath69 and @xmath68 interact with gravity .",
    "the superpotential remains the same , namely @xmath138 since the values of all moduli we consider , including the isolated local minima , are much smaller than unity , one can continue to choose the kahler potential to be @xmath139 furthermore , since @xmath69 and @xmath68 are much smaller than one , the complicated potential function in  ( [ 7 ] ) simplifies to @xmath140 that is , all terms that are higher order in @xmath95 can be ignored .",
    "the potential function is then identical to the non - gravity case with identical minima ; namely , the five - brane branch  ( [ 18 ] ) and the @xmath123 isolated minima given in  ( [ 19 ] ) . as in the previous subsection , we choose @xmath81 and take @xmath141 for these parameters , the two isolated minima in  ( [ 19 ] ) are again @xmath142 additionally , one must give an ansatz for the spacetime geometry .",
    "we will continue to assume an expanding frw metric of the form given in  ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "let us now compute the dynamics of the moduli @xmath69 and @xmath68 , as well as the spacetime expansion parameter @xmath98 , using the same initial conditions as in section @xmath137 , namely , ( [ 3 ] ) ,  ( [ 4 ] ) and  ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the physical situation remains the same as previously .",
    "we use mathematica to numerically solve the equations of motion .",
    "the result for the scale parameter @xmath98 is similar to that shown in figure @xmath72 and , hence , we wo nt present it here .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath85 and @xmath87 is given in figure @xmath56 .",
    "figure @xmath143 indicates that the five - brane collides with the end of the interval .",
    "immediately after the collision , the @xmath85 modulus gets `` hung up '' at the negative value corresponding to the local minima in  ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "now , however , the modulus is `` trapped '' near this value and does not return to the origin of field space .",
    "rather , it oscillates with ever decreasing amplitude and frequency around @xmath144 , eventually coming to rest at this point .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath87 is similar .",
    "figure @xmath145 shows that after a few small oscillations around the origin of field space , the @xmath87 modulus rolls all the way out to the value @xmath134 corresponding to one of the local minima of  ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "again , this local minimum , rather than @xmath135 , is selected by the initial conditions . however , unlike in the previous subsection , the modulus is now `` trapped '' near this minimum , oscillating around it with ever decreasing amplitude and frequency .",
    "it eventually comes to rest at @xmath146 .",
    "the behaviour of both moduli is graphically presented in figure @xmath147 . here , the excursion of the moduli to the local minimum , and the phenomenon of their being trapped at that point , is clearly visible .",
    "the other two real moduli , @xmath88 and @xmath86 , simply oscillate with decreasing amplitude and frequency around the origin of field space .",
    "hence , we will not display them .    comparing these results with those in the previous subsection",
    ", we see that the effect of the expanding frw geometry on the dynamics of the @xmath69 and @xmath68 moduli is dramatic .",
    "previously , without gravitation , these moduli evolved out to the local minimum of the non - perturbative superpotential .",
    "however , because of the absence of any mechanism for damping , the moduli eventually rolled out of the local minimum and back to the origin of field space .",
    "they oscillated forever with no loss of amplitude or frequency around the small instanton , occasionally , perhaps , temporarily revisiting one of the two local minima .",
    "when coupled to the expanding frw spacetime , however , this behaviour is completely modified .",
    "the results in figure@xmath56 graphically confirm that the moduli now evolve out to the local minimum and are trapped there by gravitational damping .",
    "the physical reason is clear . immediately after collision ,",
    "the moduli have sufficient `` energy '' to overcome a potential barrier and roll into a valley surrounding the local minimum .",
    "however , the energy is rapidly `` red - shifted '' by the expanding geometry .",
    "the result is that the moduli can no longer cross the potential barrier to return to the origin of field space .",
    "the continued loss of energy to gravitational expansion causes the moduli to oscillate with smaller and smaller amplitude and frequency around the minimum , eventually coming to rest there .",
    "that is , they are gravitationally trapped at the isolated minimum .    before drawing our final conclusions",
    ", we would like to comment on the effect of radiative damping on the moduli dynamics . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "radiative damping occurs at an esp , where the number of massless states and , hence , the quantum mechanical amplitude to produce light particles is greatly enhanced .",
    "this leads to radiative `` friction '' on the moduli dynamics , damping their motion . thus far in this paper",
    "we have ignored this effect , considering only gravitational damping .",
    "could the inclusion of radiative damping change our conclusions , perhaps trapping the moduli at the esp ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "the results reported in  @xcite show that although radiative damping is a strong effect , it requires the moduli to oscillate several times around the esp before their amplitude is substantially reduced .",
    "however , as is clear from figures @xmath143 and @xmath145 , the transition of @xmath69 and @xmath68 from the vicinity of the esp to that of the isolated minimum occurs immediately upon collision , within less than one oscillation ( note that the small amplitude oscillations of @xmath87 in figure @xmath145 all occur prior to the collision and not near the esp ) .",
    "furthermore , they never return to the esp .",
    "it is safe to conclude , therefore , that radiative damping at the esp simply has no opportunity to effect the moduli dynamics and can be safely ignored for the process under discussion in this paper .",
    "in fact , radiative damping helps enable our transition to the isolated minimum .",
    "the reason is that there is also an enhanced number of light states at the local minimum .",
    "once trapped in its vicinity , radiative damping will work with gravitational damping to quickly bring the moduli to rest at the isolated minimum .",
    "to conclude : in an expanding frw spacetime , the collision of a five - brane with an end of the @xmath0 interval passes through the small instanton point , described by",
    "the union of a vector bundle @xmath58 and a torsion free sheaf over the five - brane curve , and then continues to an isolated minimum of the non - perturbative superpotential where the vector bundle is smooth .",
    "gravitational ( and radiative ) damping traps the moduli at the isolated minimum , thus completing the small instanton phase transition to the smooth vector bundle @xmath20 .",
    "the moduli are _ not _ attracted to the esp in this process .",
    "it has been demonstrated in this paper that not only is a small instanton phase transition mathematically consistent , as shown in  @xcite , but it can also be realized dynamically .",
    "the results were presented for a specific choice of parameters and initial conditions .",
    "however , we have explored the dynamics of phase transitions for a range of parameters and initial conditions and found that the transition is completed for many different values . however , this is not always the case .",
    "some choices do lead to trapping at the esp , presumably because the energy is either too small to roll into the valley of an isolated minimum or so large that it rolls out again .",
    "be this as it may , initial conditions leading to a completed phase transition are ubiquitous and demonstrate that a nonperturbative addition to the potential can dramatically alter the results of  @xcite .",
