    "in recent years a number of large arrays using plastic and/or csi scintillators have been built for heavy ion experiments . while these arrays offer a relatively inexpensive way of covering large solid angles , the nonlinear response of various scintillators as a function of the incident particle s energy , charge , and mass poses a challenge in their calibration . to understand the nonlinear response of various scintillators ,",
    "calibration data covering a wide range of projectile energy , charge and mass are required .",
    "these requirements , combined with the large number of elements in an array , make it virtually impossible to do a detailed calibration after each experiment",
    ".    thus a procedure by which the calibration of large scintillator arrays can be achieved during or after an experiment with only a few calibration points would be valuable .",
    "the essential ingredient in such a procedure is an understanding of the scintillator response to a wide variety and energy of incident particles .",
    "considerable work has been done in the past to understand the complex scintillator response .",
    "birks proposed @xcite a simple expression for the light output which took into account the quenching of light output for cases of very large energy loss .",
    "other authors proposed expressions which also took into account high energy electrons , or `` delta rays '' , which escape from the primary ionization column @xcite , and recently a new model of light production by secondary electrons has been suggested @xcite . while some authors have applied these models to their data @xcite , many others have used empirical expressions which may not be generally applicable .    in the present work",
    "we extend our previously published results for csi response @xcite by incorporating delta rays into the birks formalism and applying the resulting expression to calibration data taken with plastic phoswich detectors from the chalk river / laval forward array @xcite .",
    "details of the calibration data are given in the next section .",
    "in section  [ sec - param ] the parameterization of the light output is derived .",
    "results with fits to the parameterization of section  [ sec - param ] to the calibration data are discussed in section  [ sec - results ] .",
    "a step by step description of the procedure used to apply the calibration to data is described in section  [ sec - apply ] .",
    "conclusions from the present work are given in section  [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "the crl / laval forward array phoswich detectors @xcite consist of 0.7 mm thick fast plastic @xmath3 ( bc408 from bicron corporation ) elements heat - pressed to 76 mm thick slow plastic @xmath4 ( bc444 ) elements .",
    "the photomultiplier signal is split , and integrated with two charge - to - digital converters ( qdcs ) .",
    "the first qdc , with a gate width of 57 ns , integrates the early portion of the signal which corresponds primarily to energy lost in the fast plastic @xmath3 counter .",
    "the second qdc , with a gate width of 183 ns is delayed by 210 ns with respect to the first gate .",
    "this qdc integrates a later portion of the signal which corresponds primarily to the energy deposited in the slow plastic @xmath4 counter .",
    "an example of a @xmath5 particle identification plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - de - e ] .",
    "ions which stop in the fast plastic @xmath3 lie along the steeply rising line , or `` backbone '' , near the y - axis . the deviation of the backbone from the vertical is due to the tail of the fast plastic signal which extends into the delayed slow gate .",
    "neutral particles , almost all of which interact only in the slow plastic @xmath4 , are visible in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig - de - e ] as the straight line below the hydrogen isotopes .",
    "the nonzero slope of the neutral line is due to the leading edge of the slow signal which lies within the fast gate .    in order to measure the response of phoswich detectors from the crl / laval forward array , four elements of the array",
    "were mounted on a movable trolley which allowed them to be placed directly in the beam .",
    "the detectors were exposed to a series of secondary beams produced from an @xmath6o beam at @xmath1=36.5 mev incident on two @xmath7c production targets at the exit of the cyclotron at the tascc facility at chalk river .",
    "six beamline rigidity settings , listed in table  [ tab - beams ] , were used to select different energies and isotopes .",
    "the production target - beamline rigidity combinations produced up to 94 calibration points per detector . a total of 41 different isotopes with @xmath8 and @xmath9 mev were produced .",
    "representative @xmath5 plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - data ] for two beam rigidities",
    ". only calibration points with more than ten counts were used in the subsequent fitting procedure .    in order to convert the centroids of the calibration points into values proportional to the light emitted in each element of the phoswich ,",
    "the qdc pedestals must be subtracted , and a correction must be applied for the cross talk of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 signals in the two qdc gates .",
    "the correction for the latter signal can be determined from the slopes and intercepts of the backbone and neutral lines .",
    "we take    @xmath10     and @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the measured @xmath4 ( slow ) and @xmath3 ( fast ) signals , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the `` true '' @xmath4 and @xmath3 signals , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the slope ( inverse slope ) of the neutral line ( backbone ) , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the qdc pedestals .",
    "solving for @xmath15 the measured signals can now be related to @xmath14 by :    @xmath20    in this paper we describe only the calibration of the slow plastic signal .",
    "the total energy may then be obtained by determining the energy loss in the @xmath3 element from a table lookup based on the ion s element number and the energy deposited in the slow plastic .",
    "in order to account for the observed nonlinearity of scintillator light output birks proposed a simple expression for the differential light output @xmath21 in terms of a quenching coefficient @xmath22 times the energy loss @xmath23 :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the scintillation constant @xcite . under this formulation ,",
    "an increasing energy loss leads to greater quenching as the primary ionization column becomes saturated .",
    "the next step is to consider the effect of high energy electrons , or `` delta rays '' , which have sufficient energy to escape from the primary ionization column .",
    "these delta rays , whose scintillation efficiency is nearly 100% @xcite , will begin to dominate the light output for very heavy ions where the light output within the primary ionization column is almost totally quenched . if @xmath26 is the fraction of the energy carried by delta rays then the differential light output may be expressed as    @xmath27    the fraction @xmath26 may be expressed as @xcite    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are calculated from the ion velocity , @xmath31 is the electron rest mass , @xmath32 is the minimum electron energy needed to escape from the primary ionization column , and @xmath33 is the ionization potential of the scintillator , @xmath340.048 kev for plastic scintillator . at intermediate energies",
    "@xmath351 , @xmath36 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq - fs ] ) simplifies to :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the nucleon rest mass . since @xmath26 is negative for @xmath40 , eq .",
    "( [ eq - birks2 ] ) is integrated up to @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the light output may now be expressed as :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 .",
    "there are three parameters in this expression : the scintillation constant @xmath25 , the quenching factor @xmath22 , and the electron kinetic energy cutoff @xmath32 .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is measured in combination with an overall gain factor from the readout device , but the latter two parameters are , in principle , properties of the scintillator material and should be the same for each detector .",
    "the free parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq - lo ] ) were fitted to the data described in section  [ sec - meas ] for the energy deposited in the slow plastic .",
    "the energy lost in the fast plastic was calculated using the energy - loss code stopx @xcite and subtracted from the incident energy to give the energy deposited in the slow plastic . in order to obtain satisfactory fits",
    "it was necessary to separately fit the light,@xmath45 , and heavy , @xmath46 , ions .",
    "the values for the electron kinetic energy cutoff parameter @xmath32 , from the four detectors , were found to be in good agreement for the light ion fit , see table  [ tab - li - res ] .",
    "the fit was then repeated with @xmath32 fixed at the average value of 2.85 kev .",
    "the results of this second fit showed a better agreement in the four values of @xmath22 without significantly affecting the quality of the fit .",
    "a final pass was made with @xmath22 at the average value of 8.25 .",
    "again , there was no significant effect on the overall quality of the fit .",
    "the mean difference between the fit and data is @xmath2 .",
    "the light ion data and final fit results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - li - res ] for one detector .    in fitting the heavy ion data , @xmath47 , to eq .",
    "( [ eq - lo ] ) it was necessary to add a quadratic term to eq .",
    "( [ eq - ltrue ] ) to account for a slight curvature of the backbone for high @xmath3 .",
    "equation  [ eq - ltrue ] becomes    @xmath48    the additional parameter @xmath49 may be included in the fit , or determined independently by making the backbone pass through a punch - in point of a high @xmath50 line such as the one indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - de - e ] .",
    "once again , the values for @xmath32 and @xmath22 were found to be in good agreement from detector to detector , see table  [ tab - hi - res ] .",
    "the mean difference between the fit and data is @xmath51 .",
    "the results of the fits for the heavy - ion data are shown figure  [ fig - hi - res ] for one detector .",
    "after fitting both the light- and heavy - ion data it was found that the ratio of the light ion gain factor @xmath52 to the heavy ion gain factor @xmath53 was @xmath541.30 for all four detectors ; see table  [ tab - ratio ] . the ability to obtain a single detector - independent set of parameters",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath32 combined with a fixed ratio for the overall gain parameters , permits the calibration of other data sets with a single calibration point .",
    "the sensitivity of the gains to changes in the slow gate width and delay were checked by separately varying the gate width and delay from their normal values .",
    "figure [ fig - gate - test](a ) shows the percentage shift when the gate width was changed from the usual value of 183 ns . reducing the gate width to 150 ns",
    "resulted in an average shift of @xmath55 , with no apparent @xmath50 dependence and less than a 1% scatter in the individual shifts . lengthening the gate width to 210",
    "ns produced an average shift of @xmath56 with a small @xmath50 dependence .",
    "the effect of varying the slow gate delay from the normal value of 210 ns is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - gate - test](b ) . for changes of @xmath5730 ns , very small ( @xmath581% )",
    "@xmath50 dependence was observed . reducing the slow gate delay to 150 ns produced the largest observed @xmath50 dependence . even in this case",
    "the observed @xmath50 dependence is still small , @xmath59% , with the largest shifts observed for li and be isotopes .",
    "data taken with phoswich detectors can be affected by differences in timing between detectors . since timing differences result in a small smear of slow gate delays , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig - gate - test](b ) may be used to estimate the effect on the measured energy of poor timing between phoswich detectors . in the past",
    "we have experienced timing differences of up to 10 ns for a few of the phoswich detectors which has now been corrected . from fig .",
    "[ fig - gate - test](b ) the effect of a 10 ns time shift can be estimated to be less than 5% .",
    "the extent to which the values of @xmath22 , @xmath32 , and @xmath61 , which were obtained in section  [ sec - results - o18 ] , are applicable to other data sets was checked by calibrating a second data set with the parameter values obtained from the first data set . in the second data",
    "set , a single phoswich from the first ring of the array was placed directly into a secondary beam ranging from hydrogen to argon ions produced by a @xmath60cl beam incident on a 50 mg/@xmath62 c production target with a beamline @xmath63 setting of 1.584 tm . with @xmath22 and @xmath32 fixed at 7.18 and 1.13 kev respectively , the data points for @xmath64 were fit with just two free parameters , @xmath53 and @xmath49 .",
    "the fit results differed from the measured values by an average of 1.2% .",
    "the light ion data were then fit with @xmath22=8.25 and @xmath32=2.85 kev and with the light - ion gain factor , @xmath52 , fixed at @xmath65 . the average difference between the predicted and measured centroids for @xmath45 was 5.6% . while somewhat better fits were obtained when all the fit parameters were allowed to vary , the calibrations obtained with the @xmath6o fit parameters are quite satisfactory for plastic phoswich detectors .",
    "the parameterization described above in eq .  [ eq - lo ] is for the energy deposited in the slow plastic @xmath4 detector . in order to obtain the total incident energy from this parameterization",
    "it is necessary to calculate the energy deposited in the fast plastic @xmath3 detector .",
    "furthermore , eq .  [ eq - lo ] can only be numerically inverted into a relation for energy as a function of light .",
    "the following steps are followed to produce a table of the total incident energy as a function of the light output of the slow plastic for a given ion :    \\1 .",
    "the energy loss @xmath66 in the fast plastic @xmath3 detector is calculated for the incident fragment energy @xmath67 .",
    "equation  [ eq - lo ] is used to calculate the light output for the energy deposited in the slow plastic @xmath68 .",
    "steps 1 and 2 are repeated for a range of fragment energies .",
    "the results are used to build a table of light output as a function of incident energy .",
    "the table in step 3 is inverted to give a table of the incident energy as a function of the light output of the slow plastic .",
    "steps 1 to 4 are repeated for each ion to which the calibration will be applied .",
    "since isotopic resolution in the phoswichs is only acheived in the calibration data through @xmath63 separation , normal data sets use calibrations assuming @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "this assumption introduces an error in the fragment energy when the fragment has a different mass number than the assumed value .",
    "for example the calculated energy will be @xmath5410% less than the true energy for @xmath73li and @xmath545% less for @xmath6o . for comparison",
    "the slow plastic energy resolution is @xmath545% .",
    "the response of plastic phoswich detectors from the crl / laval forward array has been measured for a wide range of incident particles and energies .",
    "the data are well reproduced by a fit based on the light output relation of birks with an additional term to include the effects of high energy delta rays which escape from the primary ionization column .",
    "the light output is characterized with just three parameters : the gain factor @xmath25 , the quenching factor @xmath22 , and an electron cut - off energy @xmath32 . the quenching factor and electron cut - off energy",
    "have been found to be constant from detector to detector . in order to achieve reasonable fits over a wide range of ions , @xmath0 , it was necessary to fit the light ( @xmath74 ) and heavy ( @xmath75 ) ions separately .",
    "the inability to fit all ions with the same set of parameters may be due to pulse shape differences between the ions combined with the integration of only part of the photomultiplier signal .",
    "the mean difference between the fits and the data is @xmath544% for light ions and @xmath542% for heavy ions .",
    "the ratio of the gain factors for the separate light- and heavy - ion fits has been found to be a constant .",
    "it is thus possible to obtain future calibrations with a single normalization point .",
    "tests demonstrated that changes in the qdc gates have little effect on the calibrations other than in changing the overall gain factor .",
    "the calibration procedure outlined in this paper has also been successfully applied to csi detectors over a wide range of incident particles from @xmath50=2 to 32 .",
