    "circuit - based quantum computation relies on the ability to perform a universal set of quantum gate operations on a set of quantum - mechanical bits ( qubits ) .",
    "a key challenge to achieve this goal is to find implementations of gates that are resilient to certain kinds of errors .",
    "holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) @xcite is a general procedure to build universal sets of robust gates , by using non - abelian geometric phases @xcite .",
    "hqc is conventionally based on adiabatic evolution .",
    "the idea is to encode a set of qubits in a set of degenerate eigenstates of a parameter dependent hamiltonian and to adiabatically transport these states around a loop in the corresponding parameter space .",
    "this effectuates a holonomic gate acting on the qubits .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that adiabatic quantum holonomies generically allows for universal quantum computation .",
    "adiabatic holonomic gates have been proposed for trapped ions @xcite , superconducting nanocircuits @xcite and semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "these gates still await experimental realization .",
    "an obstacle in achieving this is the long run - time required for the desired parametric control associated with adiabatic evolution .",
    "in other words , as these gates operate slowly compared to the dynamical time scale , they become vulnerable to open system effects and parameter fluctuations that may lead to loss of coherence . on the other hand ,",
    "if the run - time is decreased in order to shorten the exposure , non - adiabatic corrections start to become significant and the parametric control is lost .",
    "these problems have been tackled @xcite by using abelian non - adiabatic geometric phases @xcite to realize quantum gates . however",
    ", such geometric phase gates are limited to commuting operations and thus can not perform universal holonomic quantum computation .    to combine speed and universality ,",
    "we propose here a generalization of hqc based on non - adiabatic non - abelian geometric phases proposed in @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of our holonomic setting is that it removes the problem of long run - time associated with the original form of hqc @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate an experimentally feasible optical scheme to implement a universal set of holonomic one- and two - qubit gates for non - adiabatic optical transitions in three - level @xmath0 configurations .",
    "the proposed setup allows for any quantum computation on any number of qubits by purely geometric means .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the general theory of non - adiabatic hqc is described in the next section . in section [ sec : implementation ] , we demonstrate a universal set of non - adiabatic holonomic gates in a generic @xmath0 configuration and show that these gates can be made robust to decay . the non - adiabatic holonomic gates are interpreted geometrically in section [ sec : geometry ] .",

    "a computational system , typically a set of qubits , is encoded in a @xmath2-dimensional subspace @xmath3 of hilbert space .",

    "thus , @xmath6 is a loop of such subspaces generated by a suitable hamiltonian @xmath7 of the full system . in this way , any computational state residing in @xmath3 will in general end up in a new state in the same subspace .",
    "the unitary transformation relating the final and initial states is the quantum gate .",
    "the idea of non - adiabatic holonomic quantum computation is to make the resulting gate @xmath6 dependent , but independent of any dynamical parameters such as the run time @xmath8 and the energies of the system .",

    "this shows that @xmath20 transforms as a proper vector potential .",
