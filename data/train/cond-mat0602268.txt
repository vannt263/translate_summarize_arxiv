    "quantum fluctuations may disorder the ground state of a system , especially at low dimensions .",
    "paradigmatic example in this sense are quantum phase transitions  @xcite , where different phases can be achieved at @xmath1 by adjusting a control parameter of the system . paradoxically enough , quantum effects can provide also classical - like ground states ( cgs ) .",
    "in fact , for certain values of the control - parameter , quantum fluctuations may become completely uncorrelated ; thereby the ground state of the system gets factorized and identical to the lowest - energy state of the classical counterpart of the original quantum system .",
    "this phenomenon was evidenced by kurmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the early eighties , for @xmath2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains in an external magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "the study of entanglement in quantum many - body systems has been providing a new angle in statistical mechanics  @xcite , particularly at low temperature where cooperative phenomena are dominated by quantum mechanics .",
    "thanks to a proper analysis of certain entanglement estimators , the result by kurmann _",
    "_ was recently retrieved  @xcite and generalized to two - dimensional spin systems  @xcite ; moreover , numerical evidences arose for it to hold in spin chains with long - ranged interaction  @xcite .",
    "special interest has been devoted to bipartite entanglement of formation in connection with quantum criticality : in fact , though quantum critical points are rather marked by the enhancement of multipartite entanglement  @xcite , the variation of the pairwise entanglement at criticality captures the non analyticity of the ground state of the system  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the naive guess that the range of pairwise entanglement should diverge at a quantum phase transition , in analogy with the divergence of the correlation length of the two - point correlators , has never been evidenced  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that , in the space of the hamiltonian parameters , the special points where cgs occur ( hereafter called _ separable _ points ) mark a separation between regions characterized by different types of entanglement , ( called antiparallel and parallel entanglement in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which correspond to qualitatively different spin configurations .",
    "the transition from one region to the other is found to be characterized by the divergence of the range of pairwise entanglement in the immediate neighborhoods of the cgs ( see eqs .",
    "( [ e.divrxy ] ) and ( [ e.divxxz ] ) below ) .",
    "spin - off in systems of strongly interacting bosons are also found : we evidence that the superfluid - insulator quantum phase transition at commensurate filling is in fact a transition between a phase ( superfluid ) where solely particle - hole entanglement is present and a phase ( insulator ) with no pairwise entanglement at all : the particle - hole entanglement is easily seen to correspond to antiparallel entanglement and the range of the concurrence is found to diverge while approaching the transition ( see the paragraph below eq .",
    "( [ e.divxxz ] ) ) .",
    "finally , we study how robust cgs are with respect to temperature : we evidence the emergence of a region in the @xmath4 plane , fanning out from separable points ( see fig .",
    "[ f.fig2 ] ) where pairwise entanglement vanishes . in such region ,",
    "if entanglement is present in the system , it necessarily is of multipartite type .",
    "our study does also shed light on the result by kurmann _",
    "( see the concluding paragraph ) .",
    "we focus our attention on the class of one - dimensional spin models described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 runs over the sites of the chain , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are quantum angular momentum operators corresponding to @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the anisotropy parameters ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the reduced magnetic field , and @xmath13 is the exchange integral , assumed positive and hereafter set to unity .    in ref .",
    "it was demonstrated that cgs are obtained for @xmath14 ; although the model ( [ e.h ] ) can not be solved exactly for generic @xmath10 , the above result is rigorous . in order to analyze quantum correlations , which are crucial for understanding the behavior of the system at and near a separable point , we restrict the parameters in the hamiltonian ( [ e.h ] ) so as to rely on exact results",
    ": we therefore consider the solvable cases @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 corresponding to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 models in a transverse field , respectively .",
    "the quantitative analysis of the pairwise entanglement between two spins sitting on sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the chain is addressed via the concurrence @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( translational invariance is assumed )  @xcite . in terms of correlation functions @xmath24 and magnetization @xmath25 , the concurrence reads  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 measure the pairwise entanglement related with the occurrence of antiparallel and parallel bell states , respectively , as discussed in ref . both for pure and mixed states .",
    "we will also consider the one - tangle  @xcite @xmath29 the two - tangle @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath31 which estimates the fraction of the total entanglement stored in pairwise correlations  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath32 and @xmath33 do not show any anomaly at a separable point , they unveil it when combined in @xmath22 , which is found to drop to zero in a non - analytic way at this point .",
    "such circumstance comes together with the vanishing of @xmath34 , and with a highly non - trivial behavior of the ratio @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the completely integrable  @xcite @xmath18 model in a transverse field .",
    "besides the quantum critical point @xmath35 , its @xmath1 phase diagram  @xcite is characterized by the circle @xmath36 ( hereafter called the _ separable circle _ ) where cgs occur in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the state of the spin sitting on the @xmath6-th site .",
    "since the early papers on the model it is known that the functional form of @xmath33 and @xmath39 depends substantially on whether the parameters of the system fix a point sitting inside , outside , or on the circle itself  @xcite ; however , it had never been noticed that the simplicity of the exact solution at @xmath40 is ultimately due to the factorization of the ground state .",
    "in fact , this is clearly evidenced by the concurrence , whose expression on the separable circle reads @xmath41 and hence , being @xmath42 , @xmath43 moreover , it is @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 ) inside the circle , and @xmath46 ( and @xmath47 ) outside the circle , no matter the sign of the exchange interaction and the value of @xmath48 .",
    "according to the analysis presented in ref .",
    "this means that inside ( outside ) the circle pairwise entanglement exclusively originates from the occurrence of antiparallel ( parallel ) bell states .",
    "we remark that whether the system has parallel or antiparallel pairwise entanglement at @xmath1 uniquely depends on the hamiltonian parameters @xmath49 and @xmath3 : as a consequence , we can draw an `` entanglement phase diagram '' in the @xmath50 plane , where different phases are characterized by the presence of parallel or antiparallel entanglement . the separable circle @xmath36 marks a boundary in such diagram ( see fig .  [ f.fig1a ] ) suggesting that the occurrence of a cgs is a necessary step for switching from parallel to antiparallel entanglement .",
    "we notice that the same scenario emerges from the numerical analysis of more complicated models , both in one  @xcite and two dimensions  @xcite",
    ".     entanglement phase diagram in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "points on the circle correspond to models whose ground state is separable.,width=283 ]    as the transition from parallel to antiparallel entanglement involves the whole system , we study how the pairwise entanglement propagates along the chain in the vicinity of a separable point : for doing that , we introduce the range @xmath51 of the @xmath1 pairwise entanglement , which is defined as the maximum distance between two spins such that the concurrence is non vanishing : @xmath52    we underline that the exact vanishing of @xmath22 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 follows from the definition of the concurrence eq .",
    "( [ e.cr ] ) , in the sense that @xmath22 vanishes whenever @xmath27 and @xmath28 are both negative .",
    "on the other hand , at the factorizing field , @xmath55 for all values of @xmath48 due to the fact that the correlation functions do not depend upon @xmath48 on the separable circle . in fig .",
    "[ f.fig1b ] we show the exact results for @xmath22 with @xmath48 ranging from 1 to 5 .",
    "results for larger @xmath48 are also available and show the same qualitative behaviour : @xmath22 fans out from the separable point with non - zero derivative , reaches a maximum , and then vanishes , both for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , though not simmetrically with respect to @xmath58 .",
    "the observed behaviour suggests the divergence of @xmath51 for @xmath59 : by expanding the exact expressions of the correlation functions up the first order in @xmath60 we find  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",

    "[ f.fig1b ] : this means that the range of the concurrence @xmath51 diverges at @xmath63 .    in order to analyze how @xmath51 diverges with the field , we push forward the expansion in @xmath60 , meanwhile considering the large-@xmath51 expressions for the correlation functions , given in refs . and .",
    "the result for @xmath64 reads @xmath65(h - h_{\\rm f})^2+{\\cal{o}}((h - h_{\\rm f})^3)~ \\label{e.crexp2}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a coefficient which vanishes for @xmath68 .",
    "the range of the concurrence is implicitely obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e.crexp2 ] ) by requiring @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently large @xmath48 , it is @xmath70 , and hence , by substituting into eq .",
    "( [ e.crexp2 ] ) , @xmath28 is found to vanish both for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , leading to the logarithmic divergence @xmath73 where we have introduced the symbol @xmath74 to make clear that the functional form of the divergence is in general model - dependent .",
    "for @xmath75 the expression for @xmath27 is different from eq .",
    "( [ e.crexp2 ] ) , and to this difference we ascribe the asymmetric behaviour of @xmath22 with respect to the separable point observed in fig .",
    "[ f.fig1b ] ; however , for @xmath76 the above result is still valid , though just for the ( thermal ) ground state with unbroken symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it is to be noticed that , in the thermodynamic limit ( here considered ) and while approaching the cgs , the fact that the concurrences @xmath22 become progressively positive for larger and larger @xmath48 goes together with their getting vanishingly small : this is due both to the monogamy of the entanglement  @xcite and to the proximity of the separable point itself .",
    "the divergence of @xmath51 implies , as a consequence of the monogamy of the entanglement , that the role of pairwise entanglement is enhanced while approaching the separable point ; in fact , the ratio @xmath31 is found to have a cusp minimum at the critical point and to increase while moving towards the cgs , in full analogy with the result of refs . and .",
    "in the particular case of the ising model ( i.e. @xmath77 ) , we find that for @xmath78 the ratio @xmath31 goes to unity at the separable point . for @xmath79 and @xmath80",

    "concurrence for the xy model at @xmath1 : curves are @xmath22 versus @xmath3 for @xmath83 ( top to bottom ) , and @xmath84 .",
    "the inset is a zoom near the factorizing field , in logarithmic scale.,width=283 ]    we remark that the divergence of @xmath74 while approaching the separable circle can not be recognized as a critical effect , since the ground state is non - singular at @xmath63 and the long - ranged pairwise entanglement does not survive neither inside nor outside the separable circle .",
    "a complementary view on the physics of cgs is obtained by the analysis of @xmath85 , that can be done resorting to bethe ansatz results  @xcite . in this case @xmath63",
    "coincides with the saturation field @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . also , and distinctively from the @xmath18 case , the factorized state extends over a finite portion of the @xmath88 phase diagram of the model .",
    "in fact , @xmath89 separates a gapless _ quasi - ordered _ phase ( with power law decay of the in - plane correlation functions ) from the gapped , fully polarized phase ( with @xmath90 ) . due to",
    "the in - plane symmetry of the model ( implying @xmath91 ) @xmath28 is always negative and therefore pairwise entanglement , if present , is of antiparallel type . combining the exact results of refs . and",

    "( [ e.divxxz ] ) with @xmath95 .",
    "we underline that saturation is not related to a spontaneous symmetry breaking , and the divergence of @xmath51 while approaching @xmath89 does not mark a critical phenomenon .",
    "let us now consider strongly interacting hard - core - bosons / spinless - fermions in @xmath96 : we shall find that the occurence of cgs plays a fundamental role for such systems .",
    "hard - core bosons with repulsive coulomb interaction are described by the quantum lattice gas  @xcite , whose dynamics is described by @xmath85 phrasing the spins in terms of hard - core bosonic operators : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the relevant energies @xmath100 ( here @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are the hopping amplitude , the coulomb interaction , and the chemical potential , respectively . by this mapping , the superfluid and insulating behaviors of the quantum lattice gas at commensurate filling",
    "are related to the quasi - ordered ( partially filled band ) and fully - polarized ( filled band ) phase of the xxz spin model , respectively ; therefore , the _ band transition _ observed at @xmath104 , corresponds to saturation occurring at @xmath105 .    based on the above analysis",
    ", we state that the insulator - superfluid band transition is characterized by the divergence of the range of the concurrence .",
    "remarkably , the antiparallel character of the pairwise entanglement present in the @xmath19 model reflects the fact that close to the superfluid - insulator transition exclusively particle - hole entanglement plays a role .",
    "arguments along the same line can be applied to spinless fermions models obtained via jordan - wigner transformation of @xmath85 @xcite : the band - transition there observed is from an insulating regime to a gapless phase equivalent to a luttinger liquid .",
    "we now switch on a finite temperature in the system .",
    "we consider questions like : what is the effect fanning out from cgs on the thermal ( mixed ) states of the system ?",
    "particularly : how meaningful is the characterization of the system in terms of parallel or antiparallel pairwise entanglement for mixed states ? to answer these questions we consider the @xmath18 model where both parallel and antiparallel entanglement are present at @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath106 evidences that in the @xmath4 plane it exists a region , fanning out from the cgs , where pairwise entanglement vanishes ( white region in fig .",
    "[ f.fig2 ] ) and the entanglement , if present , is shared between three or more parties .",
    "this means that a cgs may evolve into a quantum mixed state with genuinely multipartite entanglement _ by increasing temperature_. in order to determine whether this happens or not , we need to know if entanglement is present in the system : the one - tangle , which accomplishes this task at @xmath1 , is not a proper estimator for the entanglement content of the system at finite temperature ; therefore , we have to refer to some entanglement witness . following the results by tth  @xcite ,",
    "entanglement is present if @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the ground state energy of the corrisponding classical model .",
    "the region below the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ f.fig2 ] is where condition [ e.witness ] is fulfilled , i.e. where entanglement of whatever type is present in the system .     in the @xmath4 plane , for @xmath109 ( i.e. @xmath110 ) .",
    "the white area indicates where @xmath111 .",
    "condition ( [ e.witness ] ) is fullfilled below the dashed line , which is defined by @xmath112.,width=283 ]    we further observe that , in contrast to the analysis of the ground state , at finite temperature we can not characterize the two separate phases of parallel and antiparallel entanglement . in fact , the two types of entanglement ( though well defined also for mixed states ) can swap by varying @xmath113 and/or @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ f.fig3 ] ) .",
    "the exchange between parallel and antiparallel entanglement occurs in a non trivial way , that ultimately produces the temperature `` reentrance '' of @xmath106 seen in fig.[f.fig2 ] .",
    "we also find a regime where @xmath22 can be a non monotonic function of @xmath48 , so that , for instance , one spin is not entangled with its nearest neighbor while being entangled with its next - nearest neighbor .",
    "such situations occur in the vicinity of the region where @xmath22 vanishes , as seen in fig .",

    "summarizing , we have studied the occurrence of cgs in relation with pairwise entanglement , in a class of @xmath9 spin chains .",
    "our results show that at @xmath1 the space of the hamiltonian parameters is divided into regions where either exclusively parallel or exclusively antiparallel pairwise entanglement is present , no matter the distance between the considered spins : therefore , an entanglement phase diagram can be unambiguously drawn .",
    "transition lines in such diagram corresponds to separable ground states , and are further characterized by the fact that the range of the concurrence diverges while moving towards them . due to the monogamy of the entanglement",
    ", such divergence goes together with the asymptotic vanishing of the value of the concurrence itself .",
    "we further provide ( to our knowledge for the first time ) an explanation of the phenomenon described by kurmann _",
    "et al._@xcite : the factorization of the ground state is a necessary step for antiparallel entanglement to be fully replaced by parallel entanglement . we observe that in the global reshuffling of the ground state which leads to a cgs , and involves all the spins of the chain , a long range entanglement appears as a crucial ingredient .",
    "moreover , our results for the entanglement ratio @xmath31 confirm that multipartite entanglement dominates at a genuine quantum critical point , while pairwise entanglement is essential for understanding the mechanism leading to cgs in quantum systems .",
    "our analysis is of relevance also for bosonic systems undergoing a superfluid - insulator transition .",
    "it is intriguing to conjecture that the divergence of the range of @xmath22 at a cgs goes beyond model dependency .",
    "in fact , anfossi et al .",
    "@xcite have observed a similar divergence of the range of @xmath22 also in the bond - charge extended hubbard model at certain transition lines .    for finite temperature",
    "the entanglement in the system can not be characterized by the single parameter @xmath3 and a much more complicated scenario emerges : in particular we find that , by increasing @xmath113 , the factorized ( pure ) ground state evolves into a thermal ( mixed ) state with null pairwise entanglement : this opens the possibility for the existence of an experimentally accessible finite - temperature region where entanglement , if present , is genuinely multipartite .",
    "finally , we notice that the possibility of controlling via a proper tuning of the external magnetic field whether two spins are entangled or not , and whether they share parallel or antiparallel entanglement , might be of interest both from the experimental point of view and for applicative purposes .",
