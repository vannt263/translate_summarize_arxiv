    "one of the most startling findings made in the last few years is the discovery of super - massive black holes at redshifts @xmath1 with black hole masses of the the order of @xmath2 ( fan 2003 and 2006 ) .",
    "the origin and seeds of these black holes remain uncertain",
    ".    currently , there are two main scenarios for creating such massive black holes .",
    "one is as the end - product of the first metal free stars ( population  iii stars ) that have formed through molecular hydrogen cooling ( abel , bryan , norman 2000 , 2002 , bromm , coppi & larson 2002 , yoshida 2003 ) . given the low cooling rate provided by molecular hydrogen , the collapsing initial cloud is expected not to be able to fragment into small masses and thus produce very massive stars ( for reviews , see bromm & larson 2004 , ciardi and ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "these stars are expected to burn their fuel very quickly and to produce black holes with masses in the range @xmath3 ( oshea and norman 2006 ) , with the exception of the mass range of @xmath4 where the pair - instability supernovae leave no black hole remnants ( bond , arnett & carr 1984 ; heger & woosley 2002 ; rakavy , shaviv & zinamon 1967 ) .",
    "such objects grew their masses very efficiently by accretion up to @xmath2 by @xmath5 ( volonteri & rees 2005 , rhook & haehnelt 2006 ) .",
    "the second avenue for producing even more massive black holes is through the collapse of very low angular momentum gas in rare dark - matter halos with virial temperatures above @xmath6 ( see shapiro 2004 for a recent review ) . under such conditions ,",
    "atomic cooling becomes efficient and black holes with masses @xmath7 can be formed ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "fragmentation of the initial gas into smaller mass objects due to efficient cooling can be prevented by trapping the lyman-@xmath8 photons within the collapsing gas ( spaans & silk 2006 ) .",
    "notwithstanding the origin of these massive black holes , their impact on the intergalactic medium is expected to be dramatic in at least two ways .",
    "firstly , these objects produce very intense ionising radiation with power - law behaviour that creates a different ionization pattern around them from that associated with thermal ( i.e. , stellar ) sources",
    ". the ionization aspect of the miniquasar radiation has been explored by several authors ( madau , meiksen & rees 1997 , ricotti & ostriker 2004a , 2004b , madau 2004 , zaroubi & silk 2005 ) .",
    "recently , however , it has been argued ( dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 , salvaterra , haardt & ferrara 2005 ) that miniquasars can not reionize the universe as they will produce far more soft x - ray background radiation than currently observed ( moretti et al .",
    "2003 ; sotan 2003 ) and at the same time satisfy the wmap 3@xmath9 year polarisation results ( page 2006 ; spergel 2006 ) and the reionization constraints from the igm temperature at redshift @xmath10 ( theuns 2002a , 2002b , schaye 2000 )",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the dijkstra 2004 & salvaterra  2005 calculations have been carried out assuming specific black - hole mass density evolution histories and spectral energy distributions of uv / x - ray radiation emanating from the miniquasars .",
    "secondly , due to their x - ray radiation , even the intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) are very efficient in heating up their surroundings .",
    "nusser ( 2005 ) has pointed out that this heating facilitates observation of the redshifted 21 cm radiation in either emission or absorption by the neutral hydrogen in the high - redshift igm .",
    "the observation of this radiation is controlled by the 21 cm spin temperature , @xmath11 , defined through the equation @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number densities of electrons in the triplet and singlet states of the hyperfine levels , and @xmath15 is the temperature corresponding to the 21 cm wavelength . for the 21 cm radiation to be observed relative to the cmb background , it has to attain a different temperature and therefore must be decoupled from the cmb ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1958 , 1959 ; hogan & rees 1979 ) .",
    "the decoupling is achieved through either lyman@xmath16 radiation or collisional excitations and heating . for the objects we are concerned with in this paper ,  miniquasars ,",
    "the collisional excitation and heating are much more important . in general , throughout this paper , we will ignore the influence of lyman-@xmath8 photons emitted by the quasar on @xmath11 .",
    "however , one should point out that collisional excitations due to x - ray photons results in a `` secondary '' lyman@xmath17 pumping which will dominate the spin temperature and cmb temperature decoupling in some regions around the miniquasar ; this effect has been recently point out by chuzhoy , alvarzez & shapiro ( 2006 ) . for recent papers that discuss x - ray heating ,",
    "see chen & miralda - escude ( 2006 ) and pritchard & furlanetto ( 2006 ) .",
    "collisional decoupling of @xmath11 from @xmath18 is caused by very energetic electrons released by the effect of the x - ray miniquasar radiation on the igm .",
    "shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) have estimated that more than a tenth of the energy of the incident photons is absorbed by the surrounding medium as heating ( this fraction increases rapidly with the ionized fraction ) .",
    "the increase in the temperature is observable at radio frequencies in terms of the differential brightness temperature , @xmath19 , which measures the 21 cm intensity relative to the cmb .",
    "a similar fraction of the absorbed energy also goes into collisional excitation , where this fraction decreases rapidly with the ionised fraction .",
    "these two processes , heating and excitation decouple the spin temperature from the cmb temperature and render the igm observable through its 21 cm emission .",
    "recently , kuhlen & madau ( 2005 ) and kuhlen , madau & montgomery ( 2006 ) have performed a detailed numerical study of the influence of 150@xmath20 imbh on its surroundings and calculated the gas , spin and brightness temperatures .",
    "they have shown that heating by 150@xmath20 imbh at @xmath21 can enhance the 21 cm emission from the warm neutral igm .",
    "the filaments enhance the signal even further and may make the igm visible in future radio experiments ( e.g. , the lofar - epoch of reionization key science project ) .    in this paper , we adopt a complementary theoretical approach to the numerical one adopted by kuhlen & madau ( 2005 ) .",
    "this allows us to explore the influence of power - law radiation fields from a range of black hole masses that are presumed to reside in the centres of primordial miniquasars .",
    "furthermore , the effect of x - ray induced collisional excitations on the 21 cm spin temperature is included ( chuzhoy , alvarez & shapiro 2006 )  this effect is not taken into account in the kuhlen & madau ( 2005 ) work .",
    "we test two main classes of x - ray emitting miniquasars , those with uv ionizing radiation and those without .",
    "we show that in both cases these miniquasars might play an important role in heating the igm without necessarily ionizing it completely .",
    "in addition , two simple scenarios for the formation of ( mini)quasars as a function of redshift are presented .",
    "this is done using the extended press - schechter algorithm to predict the number density of forming black holes either with h@xmath22 cooling or with atomic cooling .",
    "we also discuss the implications of these scenarios for the mass density of quasars at redshift  6 , the soft x - ray background ( sxrb)in the energy range @xmath23 ( dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) , the number of ionizing photons per baryon and , finally , the optical depth for thomson scattering of cmb photons .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section  [ theory ] describes the theoretical methods used here and derives the ionization and kinetic temperature profiles around miniquasars without uv ionizing radiation .",
    "section  [ tspin ] calculates the spin and brightness temperature around the same quasars . in section  [ imbh ]",
    "we show the ionization and heating profiles around quasars with uv ionizing radiation .",
    "section  [ ps ] present the two formation scenarios and their implications .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary section (   [ summary ] ) .",
    "the exact shape of the uv and x - ray photon spectral energy distribution around high redshift mini - quasars is uncertain .",
    "however , in general it is believed to have two continuum components .",
    "the first is through to emanate from the putative accretion disk around a black hole ; this component , at least in low mass black holes , is well described by `` multicolour disk blackbody''(mitsuda 1984 ) . the hottest blackbody temperature , @xmath24 , in a keplerian disk damping material onto a black hole at the eddington rate is @xmath25 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , where the hole mass , @xmath26 , is measured in solar mass units .",
    "the characteristic multicolour disk spectrum follows a power law with @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "the second component spectrum is a simple power law with spectral energy distribution proportional to @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the precise origin of this power law is uncertain and very likely to be due to nonthermal processes .    to simplify the calculation , we follow kuhlen 2005 and consider miniquasars with power - law flux spectra and power - law index of @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume , at this stage , that the ionizing uv photons produced by the miniquasars are absorbed by the immediate black hole environment .",
    "therefore a lower cutoff of the photon energies is assumed , namely , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is normalized such that the miniquasar luminosity is a tenth of the eddington luminosity .",
    "miniquasars with uv ionizing photons are considered in a later stage in this paper .",
    "this spectrum translates to a number of photons per unit time per unit area at distance @xmath34 from the source , @xmath35 with @xmath36    here @xmath37 is the hydrogen neutral fraction , @xmath38 ( spergel 2006 ) is the mean number density of hydrogen at a given redshift , and @xmath39 is the bound - free absorption cross - section for hydrogen with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the second equation is obtained assuming a homogeneous density for the igm .",
    "the cross - section quoted earlier does not take into account the presence of helium . in order to include the effect of helium ,",
    "we follow silk ( 1972 ) who modified the cross section to become @xmath42 a proper treatment of the effect of helium is accounted for by defining @xmath43 to be a step function at the two helium ionisation energies corresponding to he i and he ii .",
    "this however includes lengthy calculations and complicates the treatment , and we therefore choose @xmath43 to be a smooth function of @xmath44 an approximation that will overestimate @xmath45 for low energy photons .",
    "for the kinds of spectra and energies we consider here , this is a reasonable assumption .      to obtain the optical depth at a given distance , @xmath34 , from the miniquasar",
    ", we calculate the neutral fraction around the miniquasar for a given spectrum and energy range by solving the ionization - recombination equilibrium equation ( zaroubi & silk 2005 ) : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the ionisation rate per hydrogen atom at distance @xmath34 from the source . since we are interested in the detailed structure of the ionisation front , @xmath48 is calculated separately for each value of @xmath34 using the expression , @xmath49 the function @xmath50 is the fraction of the initial photon energy that is used for secondary ionizations by the ejected electrons and @xmath51 is the fraction of ionized hydrogen ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ; dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath52 term is introduced to account for the number of ionization introduced by secondary ionization .",
    "furthermore , in eq .  [ balance ] @xmath53 is the recombination cross - section to the second excited atomic level and has the values of @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being the gas temperature in units of @xmath56 . for this calculation",
    "we assume that @xmath57 .",
    "this is of course not very accurate , although it gives a lower limit on the recombination cross - section , @xmath53 ( in neutral regions atomic cooling prevents the gas from having a higher temperature ) . since the region we are going to explore is mostly neutral , an accurate estimation of the recombination cross - section is not necessary .",
    "( 8,4.8 ) ( -1.,-.5 )    .",
    "[ fig : xneut1 ]    figure  [ fig : xneut1 ] shows the solution of equation  [ balance ] for miniquasars with masses ranging from @xmath58 up to @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that the miniquasars emit at a tenth of the eddington luminosity and that their emitted radiation is confined to @xmath60 . the lack of ionising uv photons results in a very small ionized region around the miniquasar centres ( x - ray photons are not very efficient in ionization ) with an extended transitional region between the ionised and the neutral igm ( zaroubi & silk 2005 ) .",
    "we also assume that the density of the igm around the miniquasars is the mean density in the universe ( this could be easily replaced by any spherical density profile ) . due to the increase of the mass density at higher redshifts ,",
    "the ionising photons are absorbed closer to the quasar . the neutral fraction profile obtained for each profile",
    "is used in the following sections to calculate the kinetic , spin and brightness temperatures of the igm surrounding the miniquasars .",
    "the heating rate per unit volume per unit time that is produced by the photons absorbed by the igm for a given photon energy at distance @xmath34 from the source is @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is calculated separately for each @xmath34 using the expression , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fraction of the absorbed photon energy that goes into heating through collisional excitations of the surrounding material ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) .",
    "the function @xmath64 is fitted in the shull and van steenberg ( 1985 ) paper with the following simple fitting formula : @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the ionized fraction .",
    "this fitting function is valid in the limit of high photon energies , an appropriate assumption for the case at hand .",
    "we only modify the fitting formula by imposing a lower limit of @xmath70 for the fraction of energy that goes into heating as the proposed fitting formula does not work well at ionized hydrogen fractions smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "this equation is similar to that obtained by madau , meiksin & rees ( 1997 ) .",
    "( 8,9.4 ) ( -1.,-0.5 )    in order to determine the temperature of the igm due to this heating , we adopt the following equation , @xmath72 here , @xmath73 is the gas temperature due to heating by collisional processes , @xmath74 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath75 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath76 is the miniquasar lifetime .",
    "this equation assumes that the heating rate due to the absorption of x - ray photons during the miniquasar lifetime is constant .",
    "given the miniquasar lifetime relative to the age of the universe at the redshifts we are interested in , cooling due to the expansion of the universe can be safely neglected .",
    "notice that in the highly ionized regions , although we ignore it , compton cooling off cmb photons for long living miniquasars and high redshifts should be included .",
    "figure  [ fig : tkin ] shows the kinetic temperature as a function of radius for the same black hole masses considered in figure  [ fig : xneut1 ] .",
    "the heating of the igm is clearly very extended and ranges from about a quarter of a comoving mpc for a black hole with @xmath77 up to more than @xmath78 comoving mpc for black holes with masses @xmath79 .",
    "since the mass density in the universe increases towards higher @xmath80 as @xmath81 , the neutral fraction around the miniquasar is larger , hence , the heating is more effective at higher redshifts .",
    "the figure also shows that , as expected , the heating is larger for a quasar with a longer lifetime .",
    "note , that at redshift 10 other effects ( e.g , lyman-@xmath8 pumping , metal cooling lines ) might play a more important role than heating by miniquasars .",
    "however , the purpose of presenting the @xmath82 figures is to show the redshift trend of change due to miniquasars .",
    "( 8,9.4 ) ( -1.,-0.5 )      in order to test our analytical approach we compare our results with those obtained by running a non - equilibrium spherically symmetric radiative transfer code that is applied to the same problem .",
    "details of the code are described by thomas & zaroubi ( 2006 ) but here we give a brief description .",
    "the radiative transfer code evolves non - equilibrium equations for , , , , , @xmath83 and the electron temperature @xmath84 .",
    "the equations take into account collisional and photo - ionization , recombination , collisional excitation cooling , recombination cooling , free - free cooling , hubble cooling , compton heating and compton cooling .",
    "the comparison between the analytical and the numerical results is performed for 8 cases .",
    "the 8 cases constitute all combinations of two black hole masses ( 100 and 10000 ) , two redshifts ( 10 and 17.5 ) and two miniquasar lifetimes ( 3 and 20 mega - years ) .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] where the kinetic temperature of the gas obtained from the simple analytical calculation is represented by the solid line and that obtained from the radiative transfer code is represented by the dashed line .",
    "except at the centre where the neutral fraction adopted profile differs in the two cases , the agreement between the two approaches is very good .",
    "the main reason for the departure in the centre is that the equilibrium solution assumes that the neutral fraction profile shown in fig  [ fig : xneut1 ] is attained within the quasar lifetime ; this assumption is simply incorrect for high energy photons where the bound - free time scales exceeds that ( for a recipe to mitigate this effect see thomas & zaroubi 2006 ) . to summarise , given the many processes included in the radiative transfer code , this agreement is satisfactory .",
    "another comparison one can make is with the gas temperatures obtained by kuhlen & madau ( 2005 ) shown in the upper right panel of figure  7 in their paper",
    ". visual inspection of the results of our approach when applied to a 150 @xmath20 imbh with the same spectrum shows good agreement .",
    "both of these comparisons give us confidence in the validity of the simplistic theoretical approach adopted in this paper .",
    "in his seminal paper , field ( 1958 ; see also kuhlen , madau & montgomery 2006 ) used the quasi - static approximation to calculate the spin temperature , @xmath85 as a weighted average of the cmb temperature , the gas kinetic temperature and the `` light '' temperature related to the existence of ambient lyman-@xmath8 photons ( wouthuysen 1952 ; field 1958 ) .",
    "the spin temperature is given by : @xmath86 where @xmath18 is the cmb temperature and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the kinetic and lyman-@xmath8 coupling terms , respectively .",
    "the kinetic coupling term is due to the increase in the kinetic temperature due to x - ray heating .",
    "@xmath89 here @xmath90 ( wild 1952 ) is the einstein spontaneous emission rate coefficient .",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the de - excitation rates due to neutral hydrogen , electrons and protons , respectively .",
    "these rates have been calculated by several authors ( field 1958 ; smith 1966 ; allison & dalgarno 1969 ; zygelman 2005 ) . in this paper",
    "we use the fitting formulae used in kuhlen , madau & montgomery ( 2006 ) which we repeat here for completeness , the rate due to neutral hydrogen @xmath94 $ ] ; the rate due to electrons is @xmath95 where @xmath96 ; and the rate due to protons is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the effective single - atom rate coefficient . and",
    "@xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the hydrogen , electron and proton number densities in the unit of @xmath102 , respectively and @xmath73 is measured in k.    the lyman-@xmath8 coupling term is also due to collisional excitation .",
    "previously , studies that have considered x - ray heating have ignored this effect .",
    "recently however , chuzhoy  ( 2006 ) have pointed out that this contribution is very important and even dominates the spin - temperature value in a certain temperature range . in order to account for this term",
    "one should calculate the intensity of the lyman-@xmath8 photons due to collisional excitations , @xmath103 .",
    "this is given by the following equation : @xmath104 this equation is similar to eq  [ eq : heat ] except that instead of the fraction of the absorbed energy that goes to heat , @xmath64 , one should use the fraction of the absorbed energy that goes into kinetic excitation of lyman-@xmath8 .",
    "the fraction , @xmath105 , is also parameterised by shull & van steenberg ( 1985 ) and is given by , @xmath106 ( where @xmath69 ) .",
    "in the equation above , @xmath107 is the speed of light and @xmath108 is the lyman-@xmath8 transition frequency . the hubble constant as a function of redshift , @xmath109 ,",

    "the figure clearly shows that as the distance from the miniquasar increases , the temperature drops to the @xmath18 level .",
    "the distance at which the temperature reaches the @xmath18 asymptotic value depends on the black hole mass . for the more massive black holes ,",
    "this distance can exceed a couple of comoving mpc .",
    "the figure also shows that the maximum spin temperature is almost independent of the quasar mass  a detailed inspection of the figure shows a slight change in the maximum of @xmath11 as a function of mass .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that the dominant coupling parameter in equation  [ eq : tspin ] around the maximum @xmath11 is @xmath88 ( by at least an order of magnitude ) and is of the order of @xmath118 . under such conditions equation",

    ", we assume that the black hole is accreting at the eddington rate with a given radiative efficiency , @xmath151 .",
    "the radiative efficiency is fixed in this paper to be @xmath152 .",

    "the thin lines shown in figure  [ fig : ps ] show the comoving black hole mass density as a function of redshift for several @xmath154 values .",
    "the calculation is done for both imbh and smbh scenarios . the case with @xmath158 produces a black hole density relative to the critical density of @xmath159 and @xmath71 for the imbh and smbh scenarios , respectively .",
    "these values are too high to be compatible with the inferred black hole density at redshift 6 .",
    "the other extreme case with @xmath160 produces @xmath161 for both scenarios , which is too low .",
    "therefore , in the following subsections , we will focus on the results obtained from the cases with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "recently , begelman , volonteri & rees ( 2006 ) have estimated build up of the black hole mass density at the high redshift universe that form via the bars within bars mechanism .",
    "this mechanism allows for the super - massive black holes to form directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies , without the need for seed black holes left over from early star formation . in their paper , begeleman ( 2006 ) shown black hole density as a function of redshift for two duty duty cycles , @xmath164 and @xmath165 . unlike in our simple model",
    ", their model gives a rapid increase in the mass density of black holes until @xmath166 after which the black hole density evolves relatively slowly ( roughly as @xmath167 , which is obtained from a cubic spline fit to their figure 2 ) . to summarise , according to begeleman the black hole density attains relatively high values early on but evolves slowly afterwords , whereas our model the initial density is low but the mass evolution is more rapid .",
    "whichever the actual scenario of the evolution of black holes mass density in the universe , it is clear that the mass densities obtained at high redshift contribute significantly to heating the igm and decouple the spin temperature from the cmb temperature ( see figs  [ fig : dtb ] &  [ fig : dtb_loe ] ) . in the next section ,",
    "we explore which of the scenarios we explore is consistent with the currently available observational constraints .",
    "( 8,14 ) ( -3.,-1.7 )      recently dijkstra ( 2004 ) and salvaterra ( 2005 ) have shown that it is very unlikely that miniquasars have ionized the universe without violating the observed sxrb luminosity in the energy range @xmath23 ( moretti  2003 ) . in both cases",
    "the authors have assumed a specific black hole mass history ",
    "instantaneous in the case of dijkstra and more gradual in the case of salvaterra ( 2005 ) .",
    "our aim here is to check whether the specific black hole evolution histories proposed in the current study violate this observational constraint , regardless of whether they ionise the universe or not .",
    "it will be shown that our adopted quasar duty cycle , limited from above by the soltan ( 2003 ) constraint , yields a diffuse x - ray flux that is consistent with the sxrb constraint .",
    "we assume a mean reionization history of the universe according to which the igm underwent a sudden reionization at redshift 6 .",
    "this assumption is insensitive to our computed sxrb flux , and is conservative , in that it provides an upper limit on the ionizing flux from ( mini-)quasars .",
    "the sxrb is calculated for various quasar spectrum templates .",
    "the purpose here is twofold .",
    "firstly , to exclude from our models those cases that violate the sxrb constraints . secondly , to explore the influence of various spectral dependences on the sxrb .",
    "the first template is the one we used for the quasars that have no uv radiation , @xmath168 where the calculation is made for a range of power - law indices , @xmath169    @xmath170 .",
    "this represents the case in which all the ionizing radiation is absorbed in the immediate vicinity of the quasar .",
    "the case we explored previously for the heating and ionisation fronts was specifically for @xmath171 .",
    "the second template , which we have also used before , represents the case in which all the uv radiation escapes the quasar s immediate surroundings into the igm .",
    "the template used here is : @xmath172 where @xmath8 spans the same range as before .",
    "the third case we explore is the one with the template introduced by sazonov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and has the form ,    @xmath173 notice here that we keep the power - law index of the middle range , @xmath8 , as the varying parameter .",
    "the reason is that quasars in the redshift range @xmath174 with a sazonov et al .",
    "type spectrum contribute to the observed sxrb mainly in the energy range @xmath23 .",
    "to proceed , we normalise the above equation with respect to the product of the eddington luminosity and the radiation efficiency , @xmath151 .",
    "this should be done at a given distance , @xmath34 , from the quasar which we choose arbitrarily to be 1 mpc .",

    "this shows that none of these models violate the observational constraint .",
    "the @xmath152 case , which is not shown here , violates the observed constraints for almost all the @xmath8 range .",
    "( 8,9 ) ( -1.,-1 . )      we now calculate the number of ionizing photons per baryon emitted in the imbh and smbh models for the @xmath195 and @xmath196 models .",
    "the purpose of this calculation is to show that these models will not be able to ionize the universe , except in the extreme case in which the escape fraction of the ionizing uv photons is unity and no recombinations take place . to estimate the number of ionizing photons",
    ", one should integrate the number of emitted photons per unit energy over the energy spectrum of the quasars .",
    "the factor @xmath197 accounts for the absorbed fraction of photons .",

    "( 8,9 ) ( -1.,-1 . )    figure  [ fig : photon63 ] shows the number of photons per baryon as a function of the energy spectrum power - law index , @xmath8 .",
    "here we note a number of features .",
    "firstly , the maximum number of ionizing photons per baryon is roughly 10 .",
    "this number is achieved in the imbh scenario with @xmath195 for the spectral templates of both sazonov _ et al . _",
    "( dashed line ) and the power - law spectrum with ionizing uv radiation ( solid line ) .",
    "despite obtaining such a high number of ionizing photons per baryon , one should note that these two cases assume that all the quasar ionizing photons escape its immediate surroundings .",
    "not surprisingly , the power - law model without ionizing photons does not produce too many ionizations ( dotted line ) .",
    "note also that the number of ionizing photons per baryon produced by the sazonov _",
    "_ model does not vary much with @xmath8 .",
    "this is simply because the power - law index we vary in this model is in the x - ray energy range .",
    "( 8,9 ) ( -1.,-1 . )    figure  [ fig : cum_photons ] shows the evolution of the number of ionizing photons per baryon with redshift .",
    "the calculation shown here assumes @xmath171 for all three templates .",
    "the 3 left panels show results for the imbh scenario , where each of the spectral scenarios is shown in a different panel .",
    "the right hand panels show the same for the smbh case .",
    "as expected , most of the ionizing photons are produced towards the low redshift range .",
    "the sazonov _",
    "model produces the largest number of ionizing photons due to its steepness in the low energy range ( power - law index of -1.7 ) .",
    "note , that the @xmath195 case produces about 10 photons per baryon at @xmath203 normally thought to be enough to ionize the universe and the same time does not violate the sxrb constraint .",
    "however , this model does not reproduce the thomson @xmath204 constraint ( see below ) .    assuming that these curves give the actual ionization history",
    ", one can easily calculate the optical depth for thomson scattering of cmb photons , @xmath205 .",
    "this of course is not a self - consistent calculation since in order to obtain the number of ionising photons as a function of redshift , one has to assume an ionization history .",
    "this exercise is still of interest as it gives an upper limit for the influence of quasars on @xmath205 . to calculate @xmath206",
    "we assume that the electron density , @xmath207 and @xmath51 is given by one - tenth of the number of ionising photons per baryon that appears in figure  [ fig : cum_photons ] with an upper limit of unity .",
    "the @xmath205 found here for the imbh model with @xmath195 is about @xmath208 which is only one third of the wmap3 observed value ( page et al 2006 ) .",
    "as an aside , we calculate the sxrb , number of ionising photons per baryons and the thomson scattering optical depth for the begelman ( 2006 ) model . here",
    "we choose the case of @xmath164 and a rigid disk model , namely , the dotted - line in the lower set of models in their figure 2 .",
    "since their calculation stops at @xmath82 we extrapolate their black hole mass density curves using a cubic - spline down to @xmath203 . for a sazonov ( 2004 )",
    "type of energy spectrum we obtain sxrb that is about two orders of magnitude lower than the observed one , which is not surprising given that the higher the redshift of the miniquasar is , the less its soft x - ray photons contribute to the observed background .",
    "the number of ionising photons per baryon we obtain is about 10 , usually thought to be the minimum number needed to ionise .",
    "however , more surprisingly we obtain an optical depth for thomson scattering of , @xmath209 which is consistent with the wmap 3@xmath9 year results ( spergel 2006 , page 2006 ) .",
    "this result is interesting as it shows that for a given black hole evolution history one can satisfy all the observational constraints and ionise the universe solely with black holes at the same time .",
    "this paper explores the feasibility of heating the igm with quasars without violating the current observational constraints .",
    "such heating is essential in order to be able to observe the 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen , prior to and during the epoch of reionization .",
    "we have shown that miniquasars with moderate black hole masses can heat the surrounding igm out to radii of a few comoving mega - parsecs .    in this paper , two press - schechter based black hole mass density evolution scenarios",
    "have been proposed , imbh and smbh .",
    "the first model assumes the black hole population is the end product of pop  iii stars that leave behind black hole masses of the order of 10 - 100@xmath20 .",
    "the second model assumes direct formation of black holes as a result of the collapse of low angular momentum primordial halos .",
    "for these two scenarios , we have explored three different quasar spectral templates : a power - law with ionization uv radiation , a power - law without ionising uv radiation and a sazonov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) type template .    with the exception of the models that have a @xmath152 duty cycle , we have shown that the quasars are not able to fully ionise the igm  especially if one assumes the template that does not have ionising uv photons  while the sxrb constraint is satisfied .",
    "we conclude that based on the mass evolution history shown here , there is enough mass in the quasars to heat up the igm by redshift 15 .",
    "for example , for quasars with a power - law index of @xmath31 and no ionising uv radiation , quasars with black hole masses of @xmath210 can heat up the igm over a @xmath211 comoving radius from the ( mini-)quasar ( see figure  [ fig : dtb ] ) .",
    "the models with @xmath163 duty cycle reach such mass per comoving mpc@xmath147 at redshift larger than 10 for both scenarios .",
    "curiously , for the black hole mass density evolution , with @xmath152 duty cycle and rigid disk model , proposed by begelman ( 2006 ) we find that this scenario does not violate the sxrb observational constraint and produce about 10 ionising photons per baryon by @xmath203 , normally thought to be enough to ionise the universe .",
    "we also find that for a model in which the universe ionizes suddenly at z=6 , that this scenario predicts a thomson scattering optical depth of @xmath212 , consistent with the wmap 3@xmath9 year results .",
    "the main result presented in this paper is `` good news '' for the new generation of low frequency radio telescopes designed to probe the high redshift igm through its 21  cm emission , such as lofar , mwa and past .",
    "it clearly shows that the quasar population could easily decouple the spin - temperature from that of the cmb .",
    "however , since the spin temperatures achieved are not very high , this means that the brightness temperature will carry the signature not only of the ionized fraction and density fluctuations , but also of the variations in the spin temperature .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the observed brightness temperature in terms of its link to the cosmological fields .",
    "nevertheless , the high spin temperature bubbles are expected to overlap before those of the ionization , a factor that will mitigate this complication .",
    "furthermore , one can turn this around and argue that these fluctuations will teach us more about the ionising sources than about cosmology .",
    "an extended tail in the spin temperature will be a clear signature of power - law radiation , _ i.e. _ , quasars , while a short tail will be a clear signature of thermal radiation , _ i.e. _ , stars .",
