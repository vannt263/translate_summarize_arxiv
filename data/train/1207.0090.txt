    "quantum electrodynamics is a well - functioning theory which accurately predicts a wide range of phenomena , not just in high - energy physics but also in atomic physics .",
    "the best known quantum electrodynamic effect in atomic physics is certainly the lamb shift which has by now been calculated to very high accuracy @xcite .",
    "if the atom is located not in free space but instead near a reflecting surface , which could be dielectric or conducting , then the reflection of photons from that surface leads to the lamb shift acquiring a distance - dependent component , the casimir - polder shift , whose gradient yields the casimir - polder force between atom and surface .",
    "alternatively , the casimir - polder shift can be viewed as a stark effect where the role of the electric field is played by the non - zero and position - dependent electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations in the presence of dielectrics @xcite . in order to study the casimir - polder effect and related quantum electrodynamic effects due to the presence of macroscopic material boundaries ,",
    "one needs a theory of the quantized electromagnetic field in the presence of such boundaries .",
    "the method of field quantization largely depends on how sophisticated a model of the material s optical response one assumes . in the simplest case",
    "one might assume perfect reflectivity of the surface .",
    "the quantization of the electromagnetic field can then be achieved quite easily by a normal - mode expansion of the field , where the electromagnetic field is expanded in terms of a complete set of solutions of the homogeneous helmholtz equation .",
    "the presence of the boundaries is taken into account by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field .",
    "quantization is then accomplished by promoting the expansion coefficients of each mode to creation and annihilation operators which are required to satisfy bosonic commutation relations .",
    "this approach of canonical quantization has the advantage of being simple and therefore workable even for complex geometries @xcite but the perfect - reflector model for the surface lacks essential physical features , e.g. evanescent modes , which may have a dramatic effect on predicted quantities @xcite .",
    "an improvement is to consider the material as a non - dispersive and non - absorbing dielectric characterized by a single real number , an index of refraction .",
    "then field quantization can still be achieved by canonical quantization using field modes , although the specific implementation of the method requires a lot more care than for perfect reflectors @xcite .",
    "canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in terms of normal modes runs into difficulties when one wants to include in the formalism realistic properties of dielectrics .",
    "the response of the material s surface to the electromagnetic radiation in reality depends on the frequency of the impinging radiation .",
    "furthermore , causality requirements demand that any dispersion is always accompanied by absorption .",
    "however , a naive incorporation of absorption into canonical field quantization leads to field commutators decaying in time , i.e.  an inconsistent theory .",
    "therefore , in any model of interaction between real dielectrics and the electromagnetic field , the field has to be coupled to a reservoir in order to simulate the absorptive degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this can be done in a number of ways .",
    "one is to model the absorptive degrees of freedom by adding to the operator - valued maxwell equations langevin - type fluctuating noise - currents that ensure that the canonical commutation relations do not decay in time but rather take the expected form @xcite . in this approach",
    "the field equations are solved by using the green s function of the wave equation , and the noise - current operators and their properties play a major role in describing the dynamics of the coupled field - dielectric system . a number of papers have provided an _ a posteriori _ microscopic justification of such a procedure by deriving the commutative properties of the noise - current operators that were otherwise introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ @xcite .    a more direct approach to modelling",
    "the interaction between the electromagnetic field and an absorptive dielectric is to explicitly include from the outset in the lagrangian ( or hamiltonian ) the matter degrees of freedom that are responsible for absorption .",
    "the dielectric is then envisaged as consisting of a continuum of harmonic oscillators coupled to a reservoir which consists of yet another set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this quantum model of a classical dielectric was originally introduced by hopfield @xcite .",
    "the first fano - type diagonalization @xcite of the resulting hamiltonian was achieved for fields in three dimensions in ref .",
    "@xcite for a bulk dielectric and the general treatment of inhomogeneous dielectrics followed in ref .",
    "this model has also been extended to include spatial dispersion @xcite and magnetodielectrics @xcite .",
    "practical applications of the huttner - barnett model , e.g. the calculation of spontaneous decay rates @xcite , work well for bulk dielectrics where simple forms of the relevant operators can be found , though an additional difficulty is that in a bulk medium local field corrections play an important role and need to be included . on the other hand , complications that arise due to inhomogeneities of the dielectric",
    "have previously led to unwieldy and impractical results ; the conceptually very interesting work by yeung and gustafson @xcite uses the wiener - hopf method to calculate the photon propagator of the vector field @xmath1 in the presence of an absorbing dielectric half - space , but the result is so complicated that it has to be fourier transformed and evaluated numerically , whence all subsequent calculations are also necessarily only numerical .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that by starting from a power - zienau - wooley type of hamiltonian rather than adopting minimal coupling , one can carry out explicit and easy - to - follow perturbative calculations in quantum electrodynamics in the presence of an inhomogeneous huttner - barnett dielectrics .",
    "we apply the formalism we develop to the problem of calculating the energy - level shifts and change in spontaneous - decay rates for a neutral atom placed in the vicinity of a dielectric half - space .",
    "we successfully re - derive the well - known results of phenomenological methods and broaden them by providing the asymptotic expansions that quantify the influence of absorption on the standard casimir - polder force calculated in ref .",
    "we use only standard methods of quantum field theory , in a similar way as this is done in condensed matter theories .",
    "this requires the calculation of quantum propagators , most notably that of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we show that this task is non - trivial but manageable .",
    "inspired by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we find an exact solution of the dyson equation satisfied by the photon propagator . in appendix",
    "[ app : dresspropphen ] we make contact with the phenomenological noise - current approach and calculate the photon propagator using the electromagnetic field operators constructed on the basis of the noise - current operators @xcite .",
    "we are aiming to study the electromagnetic interaction between a quantum system , e.g. an atom , and a macroscopic absorbing dielectric body . to this end",
    "we use the model of absorbing dielectrics developed in @xcite but generalized to inhomogeneous dielectrics .",
    "the dielectric is modelled by a continuum of quantized harmonic oscillators  the polarization field .",
    "this , in turn , is coupled to another set of quantized harmonic oscillators  the reservoir , the presence of which leads to damping in the polarization field so as to allow the absorption of radiation .",
    "these coupled quantum fields interact with the electromagnetic field via the coupling of the polarization field to the electric field .",
    "it turns out that the subsystem consisting of the reservoir , the polarization and the electromagnetic field is exactly soluble , at least for simple geometries of the dielectric .",
    "therefore , the interaction of the atom with the dielectric can de facto be reduced to the interaction of the atomic dipole with the dressed electromagnetic field , that is the electromagnetic field corrected for the presence of an absorptive body .",
    "this approach builds on the theory developed in @xcite where the interaction between an atom and a point - like absorptive dielectric ( i.e. damped harmonic oscillator ) was addressed .",
    "the crucial difference is that for description of the interaction with a point - like absorber the dressed electromagnetic field is required only perturbatively , but in the case of an extended absorbing body one needs to find the dressed electromagnetic field exactly if one wants to capture accurately the interaction with an atom or other quantum system .",
