    "we denote the core of the attached solid torus in @xmath16 by @xmath1 .",

    "first note that if @xmath17 is a heegaard surface for @xmath19 , the exterior of @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath17 separates @xmath20 into a handlebody and a compression body , then @xmath17 becomes a heegaard surface for @xmath3 such that @xmath21 .",

    "note that @xmath26 , the distance of @xmath10 from the meridian of @xmath11 on @xmath27 . since the trivial dehn surgery @xmath28 represents the maximal possible degeneration of heegaard genus , one would expect the heegaard splittings of @xmath16 to behave better as @xmath15 gets large .",
    "indeed , it follows from @xcite that if @xmath11 is hyperbolic and @xmath17 is a heegaard surface of genus @xmath5 for @xmath16 , then @xmath29 implies @xmath21 .",
    "here we consider the question whether there is an upper bound on @xmath30 that depends only on the genus of @xmath17 :    is there a function @xmath31 such that if @xmath11 is a knot in @xmath4 and @xmath17 is a heegaard surface of genus @xmath5 for @xmath9 , where @xmath13 , then @xmath32 ?",
    "it turns out that the answer to question  1 is `` no '' in general when @xmath33 ; see remark  [ rem1 - 6 ] below .",
    "however , corollary  [ cor1 - 1 ] below says that the answer is `` yes '' if @xmath34 , provided that @xmath11 is hyperbolic , @xmath3 is not a special kind of seifert fibered space , and @xmath10 is not a boundary slope for @xmath20 .",
    "corollary  [ cor1 - 1 ] follows from our main result , theorem  8.1 , where we consider more generally the number of intersections of @xmath1 with a thick level surface in a heegaard splitting of @xmath3 with respect to which @xmath1 is in thin position .    there is a linear function @xmath31 with the following property .",
