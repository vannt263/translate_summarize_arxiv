    "the standard way to treat long range interactions ( coulomb , dipolar , yukawa near the coulomb limit ) in simulations of bulk systems is to replicate the basic simulation cell periodically in all three directions of space and apply an ewald summation technique ( ew3d ) @xcite .",
    "however , in many situations of electrochemical , biological or technological interest , as , for instance , electrolyte solutions between charged surfaces , charged lipid bilayers in water , suspensions of colloids between glass plates , clays @xcite , magnetic thin films @xcite , wigner crystals @xcite etc .. , the system is finite in one direction thus necessitating a modification of the convential ewald method . for systems periodic in two dimensions but bounded along the third one an ewald summation method ( ew2d ) for electrostatic interactions has first been given by parry @xcite and was later rederived by various authors @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the practical use of the ew2d sum is hampered by the occurrence , in the reciprocal space term , of a double sum over different particles which , due to the complicated way the bounded coordinates enter the expression , can not be reduced , as for the ew3d case , to a sum of order n , a circumstance which renders the method computationally expensive .",
    "not surprisingly , only few calculations using ew2d have been reported to date mainly to test the validity of more approximate approaches @xcite .",
    "these calculations involve tabulation and inteerpolation of the potentials on a three - dimensional grid .",
    "various `` time saving '' schemes have been proposed to bypass the computational burden of the ew2d method .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare some of these methods for the specific case of a system of charged particles confined between two charged planar surfaces separated by a distance of the order of several particle diameters .",
    "the methods that have been chosen are those which satisfy exactly the laws of electrostatics ( perfect screening , green s theorem etc .. ) and do not present numerical instabilities difficult to control .",
    "thus the charged sheet method proposed by torrie and valleau @xcite and its modification by boda _",
    "et al _ @xcite have been discarded .",
    "indeed the distribution of the point charges of the ions outside the simulation cell , located in the image cells of the latter , is represented approximately by a set of uniformely charged planar sheets .",
    "an other method , proposed by lekner @xcite is based on rewriting the sum of forces acting on an ion by a second ion and its periodic images as an absolutely converging infinite sum .",
    "the energy is obtained by integration of the force .",
    "a shortcoming of the method is the need , to estimate the sum with a given precision , to retain a number of terms depending strongly on the relative position of pairs of particles . because of this technical reason , emphasized in more detail in ref @xcite , the method was not included in this investigation .",
    "the four methods we have considered , the first three of which have already appeared in the literature , are ew3d @xcite , a method developed by hautman and klein @xcite ( hk ) , the method of hyperspheres ( hsg ) @xcite and that of concentric spheres ( cs ) described below .",
    "a way to treat the long range coulomb interactions is to place the slab at the centre of a parallelepipedic simulation box which has dimension perpendicular to the slab much larger than the width of the latter and apply the ew3d method . in this way one",
    "effectively simulates an infinite number of parallel slabs .",
    "provided the region of empty space separating the slabs is sufficiently large one expects the influence of the periodic images on the behaviour of the system to become negligible .",
    "if the distance between the surfaces confining the particles is small compared to the extension of the system along the directions parallel to the surfaces ( narrow slab ) , the lateral distance @xmath0 between pairs of particles will be much larger than the distance @xmath1 normal to the slab surfaces and it will be appropriate to expand the coulomb pair interaction in powers of @xmath2 and apply an ewald sum to the in - plane component of the interaction .",
    "such an approach was followed by hautman and klein ( hk ) @xcite .",
    "an attractive way to investigate the behaviour of coulomb particles between charged surfaces which circumvents the cumbersome ewald sums is to use a closed space , e.  g.  a hypersphere in four - dimensional euclidean space @xcite .",
    "not only is the electrostatic potential , solution of poisson s equation on the hypersphere obtainable in simple closed form @xcite , thus avoiding approximation of the interaction potential ( as for instance in ew3d due to truncation of the direct and reciprocal space sums ) , also the number of operations necessary to calculate the distances between particles is reduced with respect to euclidean space with concomitant speed up of the simulation procedure .",
    "this geometry has been applied previously to the study of the attraction between two like charged surfaces neutralized by solvated counterions in an endeavour to comprehend the stability of charged lamellar materials such as clays and cement @xcite and to the study of the effective interaction of charged colloidal particles confined between like charged plates @xcite .",
    "a system of charged particles occupying the region between the outer and inner surfaces of two concentric spheres is also a suitable arrangement to describe , in the limit of sufficiently large radii of the spheres , the system of charged particles confined between two planar surfaces .",
    "this geometry has the advantage that the interaction between charges and between charges and surfaces is the usual coulomb potential ; however it may require use of a large number of particles to render the effect of curvature of the confining surfaces small .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to check , by means of monte carlo simulation , the agreement between the results of the four aforementioned methods for the energy and density profile of the system described above consisting of @xmath3 like - charged ions between parallel like - charged surfaces separated by a distance @xmath4 .",
    "the ions , modelled as hard spheres of diameter @xmath5 bear a charge @xmath6 at their centre and each surface , of area @xmath7 , a uniform charge density @xmath8 .",
    "such a system can be viewed as a crude model for lamellar liquid crystals formed by ionic amphiphiles @xcite or charged lamellar materials like clays or cement @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the results to their thermodynamic limit is estimated by performing simulations with an increasing number of particles keeping the distance between surfaces fixed .",
    "the speed of this convergence is obviously an important criterion for appraisal of the relative practical interest of the four methods .",
    "expressions for the energy calculated with the different methods will be given in sect .",
    "ii together with details of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "results for the energy and density profiles obtained with the four methods are compared in sect .",
    "iii and conclusions drawn in sect .",
    "in this method a square slab of ions of thickness @xmath4 is placed at the centre of a simulation box having dimension @xmath9 normal to the surfaces much larger then the lateral dimension @xmath10 and the system is extended periodically in the three directions of space .",
    "the slab surfaces are located at @xmath11 perpendicular to the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the closest approaches of the ions to the impenetrable surfaces are therefore @xmath12 .    to evaluate the total energy of the system which is the sum of the contributions from the ion - ion @xmath13 , ion - surface @xmath14 and surface - surface @xmath15 interactions it will be convenient to associate to the ions a uniform neutralizing background ( filling the whole simulation cell ) of density @xmath16 and to the charged walls a uniform background of density @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume of the simulation cell . because of electroneutrality of the system @xmath19 , the backgrounds cancel out exactly and will not contribute to the total energy .",
    "the contribution of the ions and their background to the total energy is given by    @xmath20    in these equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the positions of particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the term @xmath26 is the self - energy given by @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ i2 ] ) @xmath28 is a vector of components ( @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 ) ( @xmath32 integers ) and the prime in the sum over @xmath28 means that the terms @xmath33 must be omitted when @xmath34 .",
    "the wave - vectors @xmath35 which enter the reciprocal space contributions to the energy have components @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38    in our calculations the sum on lattice vectors extends over all @xmath35 subject to @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 parameter which governs the rate of convergence of the real- and reciprocal - space contributions was taken sufficiently large so that only the terms with @xmath34 had to be retained in eqs .",
    "( [ i2 ] ) and ( [ i3 ] )    the electrostatic energy between the ions and the two charged walls including their compensating backgrounds is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electric potential associated with the electric field @xmath46 generated by the two charged surfaces and theit backgrounds .",
    "due to the symmetry of the simulation cell , this electric field is normal to the charged surfaces and depends only on the @xmath1-coordinate .",
    "furthermore , as a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions , it must satisfy @xmath47 . applying gauss s theorem ( cf .",
    "1 ) one finds @xmath48 and , by integration , for the potential , choosing @xmath49 ( any additional constant would leave @xmath14 unchanged ) , @xmath50 in the periodic system the potential created by the charged surfaces is thus parabolic .",
    "the potential @xmath45 can also be obtained by a direct integration of the ewald potential over the two charged planes resulting in a one - dimensional fourier series which can be summed explicitly to yield eq .",
    "integration of @xmath51 over the volume of the simulation box leads to @xmath52 finally , the interaction between the two charged surfaces ( including their background ) is @xmath53.\\ ] ]      in this method the slab , having the characteristics described above , has periodic boundary conditions only in the @xmath54- and @xmath55- directions .",
    "the origin of coordinates being at the centre of the parallelepipedic cell , the energy of the system is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58,@xmath59 coordinates of the particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the position vectors of points on the surfaces @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) having constant @xmath1 coordinate @xmath64 if @xmath43 or @xmath65 and @xmath66 if @xmath43 or @xmath67 .",
    "the sum over @xmath28 runs over all vectors of components @xmath68 ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 integers ) perpendicular to the @xmath1-direction .",
    "the three sums in the expression for @xmath71 correspond to the interactions between the particles , the interaction between the particles and the surfaces @xmath72 and @xmath73 and to that between the two surfaces @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . to each of these sums , due to the infinite number of replicated cells , is associated a divergent contribution . however ,",
    "if electroneutrality is taken into account these divergent terms will cancel .",
    "the evaluation of the ion - ion interaction starts with the identity @xcite @xmath74 with    @xmath75 .",
    "the added and subtracted term represents the first @xmath76 terms in the binomial expansion of @xmath77 in powers of @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the component of @xmath78 in the plane of the surface . by introducing a convergence function @xmath79 for each term @xmath80",
    "the energy can be divided in a short range part @xmath81 and a long range part @xmath82 which can be evaluated in reciprocal space . in these equations @xmath83 . with the choice @xmath84 and @xmath85 as proposed by hautman and klein the short and long ranged parts of the electrostatic energy take the form @xcite @xmath86 where only the @xmath87 term has been retained ( see below ) and @xmath88 with @xmath35 a two - dimensional vector of components @xmath89 . in our simulations we kept terms up to @xmath90 which allowed the short range part @xmath91 to be limited to its @xmath34 term even for relatively large values of @xmath4 .",
    "expressions for @xmath79 up to m=3 are @xmath92    the attractive feature of the method is that , by writing the @xmath93 explicitly as polynomials in @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 becomes a sum of terms each of which involvs products of two functions having general form @xmath97 in the evaluation of @xmath96 sum on the pairs of particles is replaced by sums on particles which , obviously , makes the computation faster .",
    "the contributions to the energy of the interactions between the ions and the surfaces and between the surfaces are easily obtained using the method of de leeuw and perram @xcite and the identity @xmath98 the divergent terms of these two contributions having been eliminated through use of the electroneutrality condition , the ion - surface and surface - surface interactions contribute to the energy @xmath71 by a constant term equal to @xmath99 .",
    "the expression for the total energy is therefore given by @xmath100      in this method the monte carlo simulations are performed on a hypersphere @xmath101 in four - dimensional euclidian space .",

    "between 15 and 30 , the influence of the value of @xmath9 on the simulation results turned out to be always negligible .",
    "also , within this geometry , if the system confined between the surfaces has a net dipole moment , a correction to the energy proportional to the square of the dipole moment normal to the surfaces can be taken into account to remove the interaction between net dipoles in the periodically repeated slabs @xcite . as the dipole moment in our system was small",
    "such a correction was not considered .",
    "a systematic comparison of the energies for @xmath136 is made in table 1 .",
    "it shows without ambiguity the convergence of the results of the four methods .",
    "it appears that the thermodynamic limit for @xmath71 is obtained for @xmath137 as soon as the number of particles is of the order of 500 for ew3d and hk and of the order of 2000 - 3000 for the hsg and cs method .",
    "however , at @xmath138 , i.  e.  at densities larger than 0.4 at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath8 , at least 10000 particles are necessary for the energy calculated with cs to agree within @xmath139 with the other methods .",
    "this result is obviously related to the important curvature effects expected for radii @xmath112 and @xmath140 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows , for the four methods , the variation of @xmath71 when the ionic charge @xmath6 varies from 0.5 to 5 .",
    "a maximum is observed for @xmath141 .",
    "this maximum occurs as a consequence of the lowering of @xmath6 and saturation of the particles in contact with the confining surfaces due to steric effects .",
    "indeed layers of particles parallel to the surfaces form at high density as evidenced by fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which presents the density profiles for the different values of @xmath6 . for large @xmath6",
    ", layers of highly localized particles are in contact with the surfaces . when the density increases ( i.  e.  @xmath6 decreases ) layers separated by a distance of order @xmath5 appear in the volume .",
    "the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are obtained by the method of hk and are indistinguishable from those given by ew3d .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] allow to compare the density profiles obtained with the methods ew3d and hk with those evaluated with the methods of hypersphere and concentric spheres .",
    "for @xmath142 excellent agreement is found for the four methods taking into account the statistical errors , especially those for the cs method . at @xmath143 differences",
    "are manifest and demonstrate the persistence of curvature effects ; they are small in the hypersphere geometry but remain important in the cs geometry in spite of the large value @xmath144 .",
    "this result at @xmath143 is in agreement with the slow convergence , in the latter geometry , of the energy to its thermodynamic limit when @xmath145 .",
    "extrapolations towards @xmath146 give the values @xmath147 of the profiles when the particles are in contact with the surfaces .",
    "it has been shown that for planar surfaces separated by a distance much larger than the diameter @xmath5 of the particles the pressure is given by @xcite @xmath148 where @xmath149 , the value of the electric field at the surface , equals @xmath150 for planar surfaces . for the confined systems considered in this work",
    "this expression is not strictly valid anymore . nonetheless ,",
    "considering it as an approximation and using the values of @xmath147 given in table 2 , an estimate of @xmath151 can be obtained .",
    "the value of @xmath151 is small and positive for @xmath152 and rises to a value of 5 at @xmath153 where hard core interactions are important .",
    "the nearly zero value of the pressure for @xmath152 is clearly in accord with the absence of particles in the central part of the simulation cell ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and complete screening of the charged surfaces by the particles in their vicinity implying an almost vanishing electric field in this same region of simulation volume .",
    "table 2 and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] comparing simulation results for the energy and density profiles for @xmath124 and @xmath154 obtained with the ew3d and hk methods , show that the latter method remains accurate even for @xmath155 .",
    "however , reliable results are obtained only if , in eqs .",
    "[ us ] and [ ul ] for the energy , @xmath156 is chosen to be 3 .",
    "the convergence of the results obtained with the four simulation methods considered is clearly the main conclusion of this study .",
    "it demonstrates the strict equivalence of the various possible routes to take into account the long range of the coulomb interactions : use of periodic boundary conditions , a closed system without boundary or simply a large system with boundaries . the equivalence is made realized only by the use of potentials preserving the laws of electrostatics and thus solution of poisson s equation associated with the simulation cell and its boundary conditions .",
    "one can remark that the system under investigation is particularly challenging to establish this equivalence because particles all bear a charge of the same sign and screening effects therefore result only from interactions between the particles and the surfaces .",
    "depending on the type of system which is simulated , the advantage of using one method or the other may differ .",
    "this work clearly shows that the ew3d and hk methods apply more favourably to the study of systems confined by planar surfaces , the thermodynamic limit being reached for @xmath157 .",
    "however , with regard to computing time , the method of hypersphere is the most efficient despite the necessity to use systems with larger values of @xmath3 to make curvature effects negligible .",
    "obviously , the cs method is unfavourable to study planar interfaces as curvature effects get small only for @xmath158 .",
    "it has been used here mainly to establish without ambiguity the equivalence between the ewald and hypersphere `` coulomb '' potentials and the usual coulomb potential .",
    "the calculations carried out with the cs method nevertheless show that the ionic density profiles are affected in the vicinity of a charged interface by the curvature of the latter .",
    "such modifications of the density profiles near planar charged interfaces may be present in solutions of inverted micelles or suspensions of charged colloids of small diameter .",
    "the determination of the relative efficiency of the simulation methods for the calculation of the properties of confined systems will be complete only when pressure , free energy and surface tension will have been evaluated .",
