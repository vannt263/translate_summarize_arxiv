    "the discrete symmetries of charge conjugation ( @xmath1 ) , parity ( @xmath2 ) and time reversal symmetry ( @xmath3 ) were long believed to be exact symmetries . however , as is well known , the weak interactions were found to violate @xmath1 and @xmath2 maximally @xcite . while the product @xmath4 seemed to be conserved , evidence for @xmath4-violation",
    "was later found in kaon decays @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the triple product @xmath0 has never been seen to be violated in any experiment , and in fact , there are several important tests that constrain the magnitude of @xmath0 violation in various sectors of the standard model .",
    "however , given our past experience with discrete symmetries , it is important to actively search for potential @xmath0-violating effects .",
    "many well - motivated extensions of the standard model have such effects .",
    "string theory is inherently a nonlocal theory , and may well be a source of @xmath0 violation .",
    "noncommutative theories @xcite explicitly break lorentz invariance , and hence could break @xmath0 . models of ghost condensation @xcite also spontaneously break lorentz invariance .",
    "there are also some experimental motivations for considering models with broken @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 violation in the neutrino sector has been proposed as an explanation for the combined lsnd , atmospheric and solar oscillation data @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath0 violation is an unambiguous signal of new physics because this discrete symmetry is automatically conserved by any local relativistic quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "therefore it is very interesting to check whether this is truly an exact symmetry of the standard model .",
    "it is particularly interesting to search for @xmath0 violation in the top quark sector .",
    "the top quark is the most massive known elementary particle , and the only fermion with an unsuppressed coupling to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "this suggests that it may also probe @xmath0 violation to a greater degree than the other fields of the standard model .",
    "there are no current bounds on @xmath0 violation in this sector , and in this paper , we will present the first such bounds , and analyze the best direction for further improving them .    a difference in the masses and lifetimes of a particle and",
    "its antiparticle is a model independent signature of @xmath0 violation . for any particle @xmath5 , with an antiparticle @xmath6 , we can parametrize @xmath0 violation for that particle by the dimensionless quantity @xmath7 .",
    "bounds on this quantity for various particles are given in table [ @xmath0 ] .",
    ".[@xmath0 ] experimental constraints on the fractional mass difference between particle ( @xmath5 ) and antiparticle ( @xmath6 ) for various particles : @xmath7 .",
    "the * means that the constraint applies to the absolute value @xmath9 @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have also estimated the sensitivity of the lhc to @xmath10 , and have shown that the constraints can be improved by an order of magnitude over current values .",
    "the ilc would be able to improve the lhc precision but not as much as for the determination of the sum of top and anti - top masses .",
    "a challenge for these future collider experiments is to check @xmath0 invariance in the top sector with an accuracy of @xmath11 or better .",
    "for @xmath12 we have argued that this objective could be achievable if all sources of uncertainty are kept to the order of @xmath13 level .",
    "a more detailed analysis and estimation of the systematic uncertainties is in progress .",
