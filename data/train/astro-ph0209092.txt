    "the cluster of galaxies a851 (= cl  0939 + 4713 ) at @xmath3 was observed during the first light period of subaru telescope using the optical imager , suprime - cam , and the infrared imager , cisco , both mounted at the cassegrain focus @xcite .",
    "five eros with @xmath4 were found in the field of the cluster , and the object identified as ero r1 was noted for its outstanding color ( @xmath5 ) and elongated shape ( @xmath6 ) with its major axis aligned with the equipotential surface of the cluster .",
    "this object , formally named to as ero  j094258 + 46592 ( but referred to as ero  r1 throughout this paper for brevity ) , was first noted in the literature by @xcite as object # 333 but did not receive special mention . in figure",
    "[ fig : images ] we present postage stamp images of ero r1 in various bands .",
    "preliminary analysis by @xcite from its _ rjk@xmath7 _ magnitudes suggested that ero  r1 is likely to be a passively - evolving early - type galaxy at @xmath8 with modest dust extinction ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the direction of the galaxy s major axis suggested that it might be the gravitationally lensed image of a rounder background galaxy , although the smooth and symmetrical shape argued in favor of intrinsic elongation .",
    "@xcite therefore suggested that ero  r1 might be an s0 or disk galaxy at high redshift .",
    "the existence of early - type galaxies with dynamically - relaxed stellar disks , as ero  r1 appears to be , is an important issue for galaxy formation models to deal with . since",
    "few eros have been studied in detail , we have made further observations of this object in an attempt to determine its properties unambiguously and determine its relevance and importance in our understanding of the ero phenomenon and galaxy formation .",
    "we report on the results of these observations in this paper .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; @xcite ) was used to observe ero  r1 on the night of ut 2001 feb 3 .",
    "a total of 30minutes on - source integration was spent at @xmath0-band , and 40minutes at _ zj_-band ( the _ zj_-band filter is actually designed as an order - sorting filter with a central wavelength of 1.11  and a bandwidth of 0.15 ) .",
    "these observations were made in groups of five 2-minute integrations at different dither positions .",
    "the sky was clear and the seeing was 045060 . the standard f9 star fs  127 @xcite was observed as a photometric calibrator , with its magnitude estimated to be @xmath13 from its measured j(fs127)=11.95 and the color correction of @xmath14 assuming the typical color of @xmath15 for an f9 star and the effective central wavelengths of 0.80 , 1.11 . and 1.25 @xmath16 m for the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19band , respectively",
    ". the estimated error of this zero - point calibration could be as large as 0.10 , considering the uncertainty in atmospheric extinction and the slight color deviation of fs127 in @xmath20 and @xmath21 with those for typical f9 stars .",
    "the images were reduced with iraf using standard reduction procedures .",
    "first , bad pixels were identified and their values replaced with values interpolated from the surrounding pixels .",
    "the frames were then dark - subtracted and scaled to have the same median pixel value ; these scaled frames were then median - filtered to produce a flatfield image .",
    "the individual dark - subtracted frames were then divided by a normalized version of this flatfield , aligned by using a bright source near ero  r1 , and combined to produce the final image .",
    "an @xmath0-band grism spectrum of ero  r1 was taken with ircs on the same night .",
    "a 09-wide , 20-long slit , providing a spectral resolution @xmath22 , was aligned with the target s major axis at @xmath23 .",
    "the target was nodded between two positions on the slit separated by 7 ; each exposure was 5minutes , and 22 such pairs of exposures were taken to provide a total integration time of 220minutes .",
    "the stars hr  1729 , hr  3928 , and hr  4761 were also observed as spectrophotometric standards in the same manner as the target .",
    "reduction was again performed in a standard manner within iraf . after subtracting the exposures in each pair from each other ,",
    "the signal was extracted in a 2  aperture .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with a combination of night sky lines and an argon arc lamp spectrum .",
    "atmospheric absorption features were removed by dividing the spectrum of the target by that of hr  4761 , which was modeled as a @xmath24k blackbody . finally , the flux scale was tied to the @xmath0-band photometry .",
    "additional multi - color optical imaging of the a851 field was made by @xcite in the _ bvri _ bands , using suprime - cam at the prime focus of subaru telescope .",
    "for ease of reference , we list in table  [ tab : obslog ] all the subaru imaging data used in this paper .",
    "we also retrieved the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "nicmos f160w - band ( approximately @xmath0 ) image of @xcite from the _ hst _ data archive .",
    "the photometric zeropoint of this image was tied to the published magnitude of an unblended galaxy in the image .",
    "photometry of ero  r1 was performed within a 4-diameter circular aperture in all the available images ( including those presented in @xcite ) , using identical parameter settings of sextractor @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of ero  r1 quoted in @xcite were obtained in a different aperture and are therefore slightly , but not dramatically , different from the values quoted here .",
    "we present the results of our photometry in table  [ tab : photom ] .",
    "the poor seeing of the prime - focus @xmath25-band image precluded accurate photometry of ero  r1 in this band .",
    "no aperture corrections were applied since the aperture is significantly larger than the seeing in all cases , and therefore the measured colors should be accurate% of the total galaxy flux , based on the exponential disk model we fit to the luminosity profile in the next section . ] .",
    "the hyperz code @xcite was used to estimate the redshift of ero  r1 from our multi - band photometry .",
    "redshifts @xmath26 and extinctions @xmath27 ( adopting the extinction curve of @xcite ) were considered , and template seds corresponding to e , s0 , sa , sc , and i m galaxies , as well as a single starburst model , were tested . the best - fitting sed ( nominal probability of 57% ) was a 1-gyr - old e / s0 galaxy at @xmath28 with @xmath29mag , which clearly provides an excellent fit to the data .",
    "the estimated formal error on the redshift is as small as 0.03 ( 0.11 ) at 90% ( 99% ) confidence .",
    "however , a second solution ( nominal probability of 26% ) was found of a 1,4-gyr - old e / s0 with @xmath30mag at @xmath31 , and the weighted mean redshift is @xmath32 .",
    "we , therefore , assign the best photometric redshift estimate at @xmath33 .    the extinction we derive , @xmath34mag , is lower than that found for dusty starburst galaxies , one of the two major populations of eros . on the other hand",
    ", we fail to see any rest - frame uv upturn in our @xmath35-band photometry , as is seen in local elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , the uv upturn in nearby ellipticals arises mainly from evolved agb stars which would not be a significant population in a galaxy at @xmath1 .",
    "the location of ero  r1 in the @xmath36 vs @xmath37 two - color diagram also suggests that this object is a passively evolving early - type galaxy , rather than a dusty starburst @xcite .",
    "this is further supported by the absence of a redshifted h@xmath2 line in our @xmath0-band spectrum , as we report in the next section .",
    "the pixel scale of ircs ( 006pixel@xmath38 ) is designed for high spatial resolution imaging and spectroscopy , and is therefore not optimal for observations of extended objects such as ero  r1 ( although it was the only instrument available at the time of our observations ) . as a result , the signal - to - noise ratio of our final spectrum is rather poor .",
    "we present a binned version of this spectrum in figure  [ fig : hspec ] .",
    "no strong emission lines are seen in the spectrum , although there is a modest ( @xmath39 ) enhancement at 1.72 , which could be attributed to h@xmath2 emission at @xmath40 . in any case",
    ", we can place an upper limit to the h@xmath2 emission at any redshift @xmath41 of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , which corresponds to a star formation rate of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "considering the modest amount of extinction derived in the previous section , we conclude that any starburst activity in this galaxy must be very modest .",
    "we attempted to determine the redshift of ero  r1 independently by performing a cross - correlation analysis of our @xmath0-band spectrum with redshifted model galaxy spectra .",
    "the average level of sed was subtracted from the measured @xmath0-band sed and it was then cross correlated with a similarly bias - subtracted model sed of a redshifted early - type galaxy chosen from a model library @xcite .",
    "the resulting cross correlation moment was calculated for a redshift range @xmath45 with an interval of 0.005 for models with various age .",
    "the root - mean - square of the derived moment is taken as one sigma error for the assessment of significance .",
    "some example results of this analysis for s0 galaxies are presented in figure  [ fig : xcorr ] .",
    "the most significant peak ( @xmath46 ) was found for a 3-gyr - old single - burst model at @xmath47 , with a second peak ( @xmath48 ) at @xmath49 .",
    "models for ellipticals give similar results but with somewhat less significance .",
    "note that a 1-gyr - old e / s0 model does not produce strong peaks in this correlation function .",
    "this is apparently due to the fact that the tio absorption features have not had time to develop for early - type galaxies .",
    "this analysis therefore suggests , though naively , that ero  r1 is at least @xmath50gyr old .",
    "although the template does not look like a good match to the observed sed of low signal - to - noise ratio , we show the best fit s0 sed model , a 3-gyr - old single - burst model at @xmath51 , overlaid on the observed sed in figure  [ fig : hspec ] , to illustrate the tio absorption features which lie in the 600800 nm ( rest - frame ) region .",
    "we use our @xmath52-band image of ero  r1 to study its structure , since this has the highest signal - to - noise ratio , was taken in the best seeing , samples rest - frame wavelengths which are less affected by dust extinction and any transient star formation , and reflects the distribution of stellar population most appropriately among the observed bands .    at the isophotal limit of @xmath53 ,",
    "the galaxy has a size of @xmath54 ( @xmath55kpc at @xmath56 ) , which is fairly large .",
    "we performed isophotal fitting to determine the luminosity profile , and figure  [ fig : lumprof ] shows that this is consistent with an exponential profile convolved with 045 seeing .",
    "we determined that the effects of seeing on the observed profile are negligible for @xmath57 , and therefore our result is not dependent on the accuracy with which we had measured the seeing in our image .",
    "similarly , reasonable uncertainties in the background subtraction do not affect the profile at isophotal levels brighter than 22.5@xmath58 .",
    "the scale length of the disk measured in the @xmath52-band ( @xmath59 ) is @xmath60kpc , which is consistent with the distribution of disk scale lengths measured by @xcite for galaxies from the cfrs / ldss surveys .",
    "they found that 48/104 galaxies with @xmath61 had scale lengths ( in the f814w filter ) @xmath62kpc .",
    "if ero  r1 evolves passively to the present epoch , its absolute magnitude would be @xmath63 , or about @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : kormendy ] shows the absolute total @xmath65 magnitude @xmath66 plotted against the effective radius @xmath67 of e / s0 galaxies in the coma cluster @xcite , with ero  r1 added .",
    "the size and the absolute total magnitude of r1 appear to be similar to those of giant e / s0 galaxies .    in an effort to further classify the morphological type of ero  r1",
    ", we attempted to perform bulge ",
    "disk decomposition of the object s luminosity profile .",
    "the central excess above the seeing - convolved exponential disk profile might argue for a modest bulge component .",
    "a detailed analysis is not possible given the relatively small size of the object and our seeing - limited images , so instead we attempted to fit the profile with five models , where the bulge component contributes 0% , 30% , 50% , 70% , and 100% of the total @xmath52-band light .",
    "we found that the model with @xmath68 provides the best fit to the data over the entire range .",
    "the @xmath69 models , and probably the 0.5 model , are brighter than the observed profile both at the central region and the outer region , while the pure disk model with @xmath70 gives surface brightness fainter than was observed at the central region .",
    "we therefore conclude that ero  r1 is similar to nearby s0 galaxies with small bulges .",
    "note that gravitational lensing may deform the shape of the image but will not change the de vaucouleurs profile into an exponential profile .",
    "similar analysis on hst @xmath71 image and cisco @xmath0-band image gave consistent result with that from the above @xmath52-band analysis .",
    "@xcite made a morphological study of 41 eros .",
    "most of these objects appeared to be ellipticals , but a few galaxies with compact morphologies were best fitted with an exponential light profile .",
    "ero  r1 has an elongated shape comparable to the most elongated object in their sample ( i d 22 ) , but r1 appears to possess a smoother light profile .",
    "it is not clear how much of this may be attributable to the higher resolution and somewhat poorer signal - to - noise ratio of their _ hst _ data .",
    "@xcite found a strong clustering signal in their sample of 400 eros and argued as a result that the ero population is dominated by high - redshift elliptical galaxies , rather than dusty starbursts .",
    "since ero  r1 appears to be a member of the class of passively - evolving early - type galaxies , it may belong to some element of large - scale structure and therefore there may be an overabundance of galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "the suprime - cam imaging of cl  0939 + 4713 by @xcite was intended to study the large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies , and a preliminary ( unpublished ) photometric redshift analysis based on their _ bvri _ data shows a slight excess of galaxies at @xmath56 .",
    "however the excess is very modest and the uncertainty in photometric redshifts determined solely from optical data is rather large at @xmath72 .",
    "further studies , including wider - field infrared imaging , are clearly needed before a firm statement about the presence or absence of a distant cluster can be made .",
    "ero  r1 s major axis is almost perpendicular to the direction toward the surface mass density peak of the cluster as derived from the weak lensing analysis of @xcite .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that the elongated nature of ero  r1 could be due to image shear of an intrinsically rounder galaxy , caused by the strong gravitational field of the intervening cluster .",
    "@xcite performed a weak - lensing analysis of cl  0939 + 4713 and found that the cluster mass distribution closely traces the distribution of bright member galaxies .",
    "high - resolution x - ray observations by @xcite confirmed the presence of concentrations of hot plasma consistent with the distribution of mass and galaxies , and indicate that this cluster is still actively evolving towards a virialized state .    the proximity of ero  r1 to the cluster center , whether defined as the optical center ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , 21  from r1 ) or the x - ray peak m1 ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , 204 from r1 ) makes it conceivable that the object s morphology suffers considerable gravitational distortion .",
    "in order for the light from a galaxy at a projected distance @xmath77 from the cluster center to be strongly lensed , a lensing mass with radius @xmath77 of @xmath78 is required , where the critical surface mass density , @xmath79 , depends on the distances to the lens and the background source , as well as the cosmological model . since we know the redshifts to the source ( @xmath56 ) and lens ( @xmath3 )",
    ", we can calculate the required lensing mass , which is @xmath80 , or @xmath81 for @xmath82kpc , assuming the center of the cluster to be the location where the reconstructed surface mass density peaks ( see figure  13 of @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : massprof ] shows the integrated radial mass profile of the cluster derived from the weak lensing analysis using the method described in @xcite . adopting the surface mass density peak as the center of the cluster",
    ", we have performed the calculation for two values of the mean redshift of the background galaxies , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "although we can not evaluate exactly the value of @xmath85 , it is likely to be closer to 1.0 than 3.0 .",
    "the integrated mass of the cluster cl  0939 + 4713 was estimated using x - ray observation by schindler et al.(1998 ) and they deduced a mass of @xmath86 at 100 kpc from the x - ray peak m1 whose location coincides with the mass peak deteced by lensing . the present mass estimate from lensing , as is shown in figure 7 , is consistent with their result .    from this figure",
    ", the mass wihin the projected distance to ero  r1 is at most @xmath87 , or a factor of 3 lower than the mass required for strong lensing .",
    "we made additional estimates of the mass after displacing the assumed cluster center in four directions , but found that the result was changed by less than 30% .",
    "note in particular that if the cluster center is at the x - ray peak m1 , the distance to r1 increases and the required mass becomes even larger .",
    "we therefore conclude that the cluster mass is insufficient to strongly lens the light from ero  r1 .",
    "since the distance of ero r1 from the cluster center is relatively small , the image , if lensed , would show distinct bending , whose radius of curvature is approximately equal to the distance of ero r1 from the lens center . the observed image of ero r1",
    "does not show any expected curvature and hence also is not consistent with strong lensing interpretation .",
    "although ero  r1 is not strongly lensed , the large mass of the intervening cluster may affect its observed shape , and we have attempted to reconstruct its unlensed image .",
    "we model the cluster as an isothermal sphere , using schindler et al.s ( 1998 ) estimate of the total mass , for five different assumed locations of the center of mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : unlensed ] ( case  0 ) presents the unlensed image if the center of mass is located at the x - ray peak m1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : unlensed4 ] , we present four additional images where we have displaced the center of mass by 10  ( equal to the smoothing applied to the x - ray image ) from m1 ; we refer to these as cases n , w , e , and s , according to whether the displacement was made to the north , west , east , or south , respectively .",
    "the calculation for case  n requires data in an unobserved region , and we assigned the lowest observed surface brightness to this region .",
    "we constructed the luminosity profiles of the five unlensed images and confirmed that they were all well - fit with an exponential disk profile , as expected .",
    "ero  r1 therefore possesses a significant disk component and its elongated shape is not due to gravitational lensing of a rounder elliptical galaxy .",
    "our interpretation of an apparently relaxed , massive s0 galaxy at @xmath56 is made difficult since we do not know whether it lies in a cluster or in the field .",
    "the luminous early - type populations of rich clusters are known to be remarkably homogeneous and the bulk of their stellar populations appear to be old @xcite .",
    "@xcite found from their spectroscopic data that there is no statistically significant difference between the luminosity - weighted age of the e and s0 galaxies in clusters at @xmath88 , supporting the conventional formation model of old , coeval e and s0 galaxies . in nearby clusters , the density  morphology relation and the formation of s0 galaxies",
    "are often related to the effects of ram pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "this is unlikely to be the cause of ero  r1 s morphology , however , since it is not clear whether ram pressure stripping could occur effectively at such an early cosmic epoch , and our optical ",
    "infrared images provide no evidence for the existence of a rich cluster .",
    "we note that @xcite identified another ero in the field of cl  0939 + 4713 ( named cl  0939 + 4713  b ) as a passively - evolving galaxy at @xmath89 ( the redshifts of ero  r1 and cl  0939 + 4713  b are marginally consistent given the uncertainties ) , although this is @xmath90kpc from r1 and therefore can not be said to belong to the same ` cluster ' .",
    "it is far more likely , therefore , that ero  r1 is simply a field galaxy .",
    "a morphological analysis of galaxies in the hubble deep fields by @xcite led these authors to conclude that massive e / s0 galaxies tend to disappear from flux - limited samples at @xmath91 .",
    "they therefore suggested that the era @xmath92 corresponds to a very active phase for the assembly of massive e / s0 galaxies in the field .",
    "@xcite studied the gravitationally lensed ero  j003707 + 0909.5 at @xmath93 in the field of the cluster a68 . from their reconstructed image and photometric analysis , they concluded that this object is an @xmath94 early - type disk - galaxy , and therefore very similar to ero  r1 .",
    "in addition to the known classes of eros , i.e. , dusty starbursts such as hr  10 @xcite and passively - evolving ellipticals , @xcite suggested that a significant fraction of eros may evolve into luminous spiral galaxies by the present epoch .",
    "if the absence of high over density of galaxies around r1 is confirmed , some constraints will be placed as to the physical mechanisms of forming s0 galaxies .",
    "as already discussed , ram - pressure stripping will not be a dominant factor and instead a mechanism which can be effective in lower density regions will be required .",
    "this is consistent with the recent findings that the truncation of star formation in galaxies is not the phenomenon restricted to the dense cluster cores but is wide spread to relatively low density regions ( e.g. , kodama et al.2001 ; balogh et al.1999 ; 2002 , lewis et al.2002 ; gomez et al.2002 ) .",
    "we have presented new observations of ero  r1 in the field of the rich cluster cl  0939 + 4713 ( a851 ) . by independent analyses of its multi - color photometry and @xmath0-band spectrum ,",
    "we have concluded that it is a passively - evolving galaxy at @xmath95 .",
    "we have shown that gravitational lensing by the foreground cluster may play some part in , but can not be the main cause of , its elongated shape .",
    "the radial luminosity profile is well - represented by an exponential disk with a relatively small bulge component , indicating that the stellar population in this galaxy is well - relaxed .",
    "our results have led us to conclude that ero  r1 is an s0-like galaxy whose stellar disk is already well - developed by @xmath56 .",
    "this conclusion poses a new constraint on models of disk formation at high redshift .",

    "<S> we present further observations of the extremely red object ero  j094258 + 4659.2 , identified by @xcite as ero r1 in their deep images of the cluster a851 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate its redshift independently by eight - band photometric redshift determination and cross - correlation of a new @xmath0-band spectrum with the optical spectra of local e / s0 galaxies , and conclude that it lies at @xmath1 . although its colors are consistent both with an elliptical galaxy and an s0 galaxy at that redshift , its elongated shape and exponential luminosity profile suggest the presence of an evolved stellar disk component . </S>",
    "<S> we rule out the possibility that these properties are strongly influenced by gravitational lensing by the foreground cluster , and therefore conclude that this object is more likely to be an s0-like galaxy , rather than a lensed elliptical . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-band spectrum does not show strong h@xmath2 emission and the star formation rate therefore appears to be very modest . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such a galaxy with an apparently relaxed disk of stars at this high redshift provides a new and strong constraint on theoretical models which aim to explain the formation and evolution of galaxies . </S>"
