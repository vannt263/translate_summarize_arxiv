    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a well - motivated candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the gauge couplings within the mssm unify to within a few percent at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , @xmath0 gev , and the lightest supersymmetric particle is a good dark matter candidate provided that r - parity is conserved .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) can also naturally stabilize the hierarchy between the electroweak ( ew ) and the gut or planck scale .",
    "it does this by providing a radiative mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) where large quantum fluctuations of the scalar top squarks due to the large yukawa coupling destabilize the origin of the higgs potential .",
    "in much of the mssm parameter space this quite naturally leads to the right ewsb scale , as long as the soft susy breaking parameters lie near it .    the absence of any direct experimental evidence from collider searches for the mssm scalar particles and the higgs boson has , however , ruled out significant regions in the mssm parameter space .",
    "indirect evidence from ew precision measurements and searches for flavor changing neutral currents , cp violating effects and rare decays has not been forthcoming either , providing additional severe constraints . as a result the soft susy breaking parameters must lie well above the ew scale in order to satisfy the experimental constraints , especially the constraints on the higgs mass from the results of the cern lep collider ( @xmath1 gev @xcite ) .",
    "soft susy breaking parameters well above the ew scale reintroduce a small hierarchy and require some fine - tuning ( ft ) among the susy parameters in order to obtain ewsb @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is usually referred to as the supersymmetric little hierarchy problem .",
    "different choices for the soft susy breaking parameters lead to different amounts of ft .",
    "this paper presents the minimally tuned mssm ( or mtmssm ) , i.e. the mssm parameter region that has the least model - independent ft of ewsb .",
    "model - independent means that no relations are assumed between the soft susy breaking parameters at the scale at which they are generated ( which will be referred to as the messenger scale ) .",
    "rather , each of them is taken to be an independent parameter which is free at the messenger scale , and which therefore can contribute to the total ft of the ewsb scale .",
    "the messenger scale itself is varied between 2 tev and @xmath2 and the effect of this on the minimal ft is discussed ( see also @xcite ) .    in section [ sec : ewsb ] , ewsb in the mssm will be reviewed .",
    "section [ sec : tuning measure ] discusses the tuning measure used in this paper .",
    "the parameters taken to contribute to the tuning are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the gaugino masses @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the stop soft masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the stop soft trilinear coupling @xmath10 .",
    "section [ sec : mmit ] contains some of the main results .",
    "the low- and high - scale mssm spectrum which leads to the least model - independent ft is found .",
    "this is done for various messenger scales by numerically minimizing the ft expression subject to constraints on the higgs , stop , and gaugino masses .",
    "the results are then motivated analytically .",
    "the least ft is found to be about 5@xmath11 if the messenger scale coincides with the gut scale .",
    "an important feature of the least ft region is negative stop soft masses at the messenger scale ( first pointed out in @xcite ) . even for messenger scales as low as 2 tev ,",
    "the stop soft masses are tachyonic at the messenger scale ( threshold effects in the rg - running were neglected throughout ) .",
    "this does not lead to any problems with charge and/or color breaking minima .",
    "another feature of the least ft region is that the trilinear stop soft coupling , @xmath10 , is negative and lies near `` natural '' maximal mixing , i.e. @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the average of the two stop soft masses .",
    "this value for @xmath10 maximizes the radiative corrections to @xmath14 .",
    "the large stop mixing leads to a sizeable splitting between the two stop mass eigenstates .",
    "moreover , the gluino mass , @xmath7 , is much smaller than the wino mass , @xmath6 , at the high scale .",
    "the wino mass , in turn , is much smaller than the bino mass @xmath5 .",
    "phenomenological consequences of the low - scale spectrum are briefly summarized .",
    "section [ sec : ft_vs_mh ] contains the rest of the main results of the paper .",
    "the ft is minimized as a function of the lower bound on the higgs mass ( with the messenger scale set to @xmath2 ) .",
    "although the numerical minimization procedure contains the dominant one - loop expression for @xmath14 as a constraint , the resulting least ft spectra are used to calculate @xmath14 more accurately with the program @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the result is a plot of the minimal ft as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "there are several striking features of this plot .",
    "first of all , for @xmath14 larger than a certain value , the ft increases very rapidly .",
    "secondly , around this @xmath14 , the value of @xmath10 in the least ft region makes a sudden transition from lying near @xmath16 to lying near @xmath17 .",
    "the third striking feature is that this value of @xmath14 is surprisingly low .",
    "the precise value is only slightly dependent on the parameters in the higgs sector and can be taken to lie around 120 gev .",
    "the upshot of this analysis is that although the mssm right now is already fine - tuned at least at about the @xmath18 level ( if the messenger scale equals the gut scale ) , there is not much room left for the higgs mass to increase before the ft becomes exponentially worse .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains a summary of the results and the conclusions .",
    "appendix [ sec : master formula ] reviews the semi - numerical solutions of the mssm one - loop renormalization - group ( rg ) equations .",
    "these are used to calculate the expression for the ft employed in this paper .",
    "appendix [ sec : ftcomps ] contains a list of expressions for the ft with respect to various parameters .",
    "in the higgs decoupling limit of the mssm , the lower bound on the mass of the lighter cp - even higgs mass eigenstate @xmath19 coincides with the 114.4 gev bound on the mass of the sm higgs boson @xcite . the mass of @xmath19 may be approximated by [ eqn : higgs mass ] m_h^2 m_z^2 ^ 2 2 + which , in addition to the tree - level higgs mass , includes the dominant one - loop quantum corrections coming from top and stop loops @xcite .",
    "here @xmath20 is the top mass , @xmath21 is the arithmetic mean of the two squared stop masses and @xmath22 gev where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 gauge coupling and @xmath25 is the mass of the @xmath26-boson .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ eqn : higgs mass ] ) assumes @xmath13 @xmath27 @xmath20 .",
    "the stop mixing parameter is given by @xmath28 ( @xmath29 @xmath10 for large @xmath30 ) , where @xmath10 denotes the stop soft trilinear coupling and @xmath31 is the supersymmetric higgsino mass parameter .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eqn : higgs mass ] ) is the tree - level contribution to the higgs mass .",
    "the first term in square brackets comes from renormalization group running of the higgs quartic coupling below the stop mass scale and vanishes in the limit of exact supersymmetry .",
    "it grows logarithmically with the stop mass .",
    "the second term in square brackets is only present for non - zero stop mixing and comes from a finite threshold correction to the higgs quartic coupling at the stop mass scale .",
    "it is independent of the stop mass for fixed @xmath32 , and grows as @xmath33 for small @xmath32",
    ".    equation ( [ eqn : higgs mass ] ) implies a combination of three things which are required to satisfy the bound on @xmath14 , namely a large tree - level contribution , large stop masses and large stop mixing .",
    "a large tree - level contribution to @xmath14 requires @xmath30 to be at least of a moderate size ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "although the stop masses must be rather large , their lower bound is very sensitive to the size of the stop mixing , with larger mixing allowing for much smaller stop masses ( see @xcite for a recent study on this ) .",
    "the reason for this sensitive dependence is due to the higgs mass depending logarithmically on the stop masses in contrast to the polynomial dependence on the stop mixing .",
    "the soft masses are not only directly constrained from the lep higgs bounds but also indirectly by constraints on flavor changing neutral currents , electroweak precision measurements and cp - violation . besides these , however , the higgs sector parameters are also constrained by requiring that the electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "this leads to the following two tree - level relations at the low scale [ eqn : ewsbsin2beta ] 2= = [ eqn : ewsbmz1 ] = -||^2 + , where @xmath35 is the cp - odd higgs mass , and @xmath36 is determined from the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath39 .",
    "the masses @xmath4 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the three soft mass parameters in the mssm higgs sector . for a given value of @xmath30 , @xmath41 may be eliminated in favor of @xmath42 with equation ( [ eqn : ewsbsin2beta ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz1 ] ) gives an expression for @xmath43 in terms of the supersymmetric mass parameter @xmath31 and the soft masses @xmath4 and @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath30 should be sizeable , the contribution from @xmath40 to the expression for @xmath43 may be neglected and ( [ eqn : ewsbmz1 ] ) simplifies to [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] m_z^2 = -2||^2 - 2m_h_u^2 .",
    "close to the higgs decoupling limit , @xmath35 is relatively large . however , since @xmath44 to avoid large cancellations , @xmath35 may not be too large , otherwise @xmath40 would also be sizeable and equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) would break down ( unless the value of @xmath30 is increased accordingly ) . by choosing @xmath45 and @xmath46 gev in the numerical analysis throughout , equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) holds to a very good approximation .    equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) holds at tree - level , and although quantum corrections may add @xmath47(10 gev ) to the right hand side of ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) , this has negligible impact on the amount of fine - tuning to be discussed below .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 in equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) are evaluated at the scale @xmath48 . since the fine - tuning of ewsb is a measure of the sensitivity of some low - scale ewsb parameter ( usually taken to be @xmath43 ) to a change in high - scale input parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 need to be evolved to a high scale using their rg equations . under rg",
    "running many of the soft parameters mix , and as a result of this mixing , the expression for @xmath43 in terms of parameters that are evaluated at the messenger scale @xmath49 differs significantly from the simple form given in ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) .",
    "the rg - equations may be integrated ( see appendix [ sec : master formula ] ) and the expression for @xmath43 may generically be written as @xcite [ eqn : mzsq generic ] m_z^2 = _ i , j c_ij(,m_s)m_i(m_s)m_j(m_s ) . for moderate and not too large values of @xmath30 with an appropriate @xmath35 ,",
    "the simplified expression for @xmath43 is applicable ( equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) ) and contributions from the bottom / sbottom and tau / stau sectors may still be neglected .",
    "the most important parameters appearing in ( [ eqn : mzsq generic ] ) then are @xmath50 , @xmath4 , the gaugino masses @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the stop soft masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the stop soft trilinear coupling @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath51 depend on @xmath30 and the messenger scale @xmath49 .",
    "the most important coefficients are shown in figure [ fig : coefficients ] for @xmath52 as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "defined in equation ( [ eqn : mzsq generic ] ) for @xmath45 as a function of the messenger scale @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig : coefficients ] ]    at the scale @xmath48 , the coefficients of @xmath4 and @xmath50 are @xmath53 while the coefficients of the other soft parameters are zero in agreement with equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) . since @xmath50 is a supersymmetric parameter , it gets renormalized multiplicatively and its rg evolution does not give rise to soft parameters ( see equation ( [ eqn : mu ] ) ) .",
    "figure [ fig : coefficients ] shows that the coefficient of @xmath50 does not vary much and remains close to @xmath53 all the way up to the gut scale .",
    "the rg evolution of @xmath4 to higher messenger scales , however , generates non - zero coefficients for the other soft parameters .",
    "the @xmath36-function of @xmath4 , @xmath54 depends on the stop sector parameters @xmath55 , the wino and bino masses @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and @xmath56 , which thus get generated immediately under rg evolution .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath6 and especially @xmath5 and @xmath57 in ( [ eqn : bmhu ] ) are small and lead to small coefficients in the expression for @xmath43 ( [ eqn : mzsq generic ] ) .",
    "although @xmath58 does not explicitly depend on the gluino mass , a non - zero coefficient for @xmath7 is generated indirectly since the stop sector @xmath36-functions depend on @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , @xmath7 appears with a large coefficient in these @xmath36-functions , and thus the coefficient of @xmath7 in equation ( [ eqn : mzsq generic ] ) dominates after a few decades of rg evolution .",
    "for example , at a messenger scale of @xmath59 gev , the expression for @xmath43 ( for @xmath30 = 10 ) is @xmath60 where the hatted parameters on the right - hand side are all evaluated at @xmath49 .",
    "this expression may be used to calculate the ft as discussed next .",
    "a variety of tuning measures have been used in the literature ( a list of references has been provided in the introduction ) . since the concept of fine - tuning ( ft ) is inherently subjective , there is no absolute definition of a ft measure .",
    "the most common definition of the sensitivity of an observable @xmath61 on a parameter @xmath62 , denoted by @xmath63 , is given by @xcite [ eqn : ftab ] ( , a_i ) = || = || .",
    "@xmath63 thus measures the percentage variation of the observable under a percentage variation of the parameter .",
    "a large value of @xmath63 signifies that a small change in the parameter leads to a large change in the observable , and suggests that the observable is fine - tuned with respect to that parameter .",
    "assuming that the individual @xmath63 are uncorrelated , they may be combined to form the ft measure [ eqn : ftdefngeneral ] ( ) = .    of interest in this paper",
    "is to quantify the sensitivity of ewsb in the mssm on ( soft ) supersymmetric parameters at the messenger scale @xmath49 . to this end ,",
    "the observable to consider is @xmath43 as a function of the supersymmetric higgsino mass squared and the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , collectively denoted by @xmath64 ( in the ft measure , all parameters are taken to have mass dimension two ) .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath43 with respect to each parameter may be calculated as in ( [ eqn : ftab ] ) with @xmath65 , and the total ft of @xmath43 on parameters evaluated at the messenger scale @xmath49 may be quantified by [ eqn : ftdefn ] ( m_z^2;m_s)=. @xmath66 may be interpreted as the length of a `` fine - tuning vector '' with components @xmath67 .",
    "this fine - tuning vector is formally a vector field defined by the gradient of the scalar field @xmath68 , a function of @xmath69 , along surfaces of constant @xmath68 .",
    "there are several possible drawbacks to this ft measure , see for example @xcite .",
    "one of these is that the individual @xmath70 are assumed to be uncorrelated . within a given model of supersymmetry breaking , there may be relations among the parameters at the messenger scale .",
    "this would imply that the ft vector is projected onto a subspace , and the resulting ft is necessarily less .",
    "in other words , the tuning of one parameter is correlated with the tuning of another , so that the total ft should be less than that given by ( [ eqn : ftdefn ] ) . moreover , within a given model the values of the parameters at the messenger scale may be restricted to certain ranges , whereas ( [ eqn : ftdefn ] ) assumes that all values are equally likely . however",
    ", no model for supersymmetry breaking will be assumed here . instead , the minimal ft will be found as a function of the messenger scale @xmath49 assuming no relations or restrictions among the high - scale input parameters .",
    "for this `` model - independent '' tuning it is satisfactory to use the ft measure ( [ eqn : ftdefn ] ) .",
    "note that to find the tuning of a model , one should in principle consider the tuning of all observables , since the absence of tuning in one observable does not necessarily imply it is small in others , see e.g. @xcite . in this paper , however , only the tuning of ewsb will be considered .",
    "finally , note that the ft with respect to a single parameter is by definition ( [ eqn : ftab ] ) zero if that parameter happens to be zero at the messenger scale .",
    "an extreme version of this is found in the no - scale model @xcite , where all scalar soft masses are much smaller than the gaugino masses at the high scale . setting them to zero , and using ( [ eqn : ftab ] ) and ( [ eqn : ftdefn ] ) the ft",
    "could be expected to be small .",
    "however , it may be shown that this does not minimize the ft , since @xmath7 and @xmath31 need to be quite large at the high scale to satisfy all the low - energy experimental bounds ( see @xcite ) . in the results presented in this paper , no parameter",
    "is found to be zero at the high scale .",
    "in this section the minimal model independent tuning will be found as a function of the messenger scale .",
    "the ft given by equation ( [ eqn : ftdefn ] ) is written in terms of parameters evaluated at the messenger scale . in order to find the minimal ft ( mft ) for a given messenger scale that is consistent with low - energy experimental constraints ,",
    "it is easiest to rewrite the ft expression in terms of parameters that are evaluated at the low scale .",
    "this can be done by expressing each high - scale parameter in terms of low - scale parameters , see appendix [ sec : master formula ] . once the ft is written in terms of low - scale parameters , @xmath71 may be eliminated by using equation ( @xmath72 ) ( neglecting contributions from @xmath40 ) .",
    "the low - energy constraints considered in this paper include bounds on the ( physical ) sparticle masses , on the gaugino masses , and on the higgs mass or the electroweak @xmath73- and @xmath74-parameter do not significantly affect the results presented below , since an experimentally consistent value can be obtained by only small adjustments ( if at all necessary ) in the least fine - tuned parameters - see also @xcite . ] .",
    "the top quark mass @xmath20 is set to the central value of the latest tevatron mass measurement of 170.9 @xmath75 1.8 gev @xcite .",
    "the physical stop masses are required to be at least 100 gev which is illustrative of the actual , slightly model dependent , lower bound obtained from the tevatron @xcite .",
    "it is found that the region of mft does not quite saturate this bound , although a slightly larger value for @xmath20 would allow the lighter stop to be as low as 100 gev .",
    "the gaugino masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as @xmath31 , are taken to have a lower bound of 100 gev .",
    "the gluino mass is found to be never smaller than 335 gev in the numerical results presented in this section , and this does not generically violate any experimental bounds .",
    "the most important constraint is the higgs mass bound of 114.4 gev ( valid in the decoupling limit ) , since it turns out that this bound is always saturated when minimizing the ft . in the numerical results presented in this paper , the higgs mass",
    "is calculated using the formulas found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these formulas include the one - loop corrections coming from the top / stop sector and are simple enough to be used as constraints in the ft minimization ( but note that the sign convention used for @xmath10 is that of @xcite ) .",
    "a running top mass @xmath76 , evaluated in the @xmath77-scheme , is used to capture some of the leading two - loop contributions .",
    "higher - order corrections to the higgs mass still play a very important role , however , and more accurate higgs masses may be obtained with the program @xmath15 . in order to take some of these higher - order corrections into account and thus obtain a more accurate estimate of the mft , a lower bound for the higgs mass of 121.5 gev is used in the ft minimization , instead of the sm lower bound of 114.4 gev . the typical low energy sparticle spectrum obtained in the analysis",
    "then leads to higgs masses that satisfy the sm higgs bound when calculated with @xmath15 ( version 2.6.0 , assuming real parameters ) .",
    "sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) is used as a minimization algorithm . given the ft function ( [ eqn : ftdefn ] ) written in terms of low scale parameters , as well as linear constraints on the gaugino masses and @xmath31 , non - linear constraints on the physical stop and higgs masses , and an initial guess , sqp generates a less ft point until the minimum is found . unlike other minimization algorithms",

    "( as an aside , for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the mft for a higgs mass of 114 gev is about 11 , i.e. 9@xmath11 . ) the largest contribution to the total minimal ft comes from @xmath80 and @xmath83 which are both comparable for all values of @xmath49 .",
    "the next most important contribution is that from @xmath81 .",
    "the contributions from @xmath50 , as well as @xmath84 and @xmath85 are less important and increase only slightly as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "the ft from @xmath4 is very small for all messenger scales while the contribution from @xmath82 is negligible for small and large @xmath49 but larger for intermediate messenger scales .",
    "the large contribution from @xmath80 is mainly because it has the largest ( in magnitude ) coefficient in the expression for @xmath43 , at least for @xmath49 @xmath89 @xmath90 gev , see figure [ fig : coefficients ] .",

    "the reason that the cross - term contributions are so large is that the mft values of @xmath10 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 are rather sizeable at the messenger scale when compared with @xmath7 ( at least for @xmath49 @xmath89 @xmath95 gev ) .",

    "the high - scale value of @xmath7 , however , decreases significantly as the messenger scale is increased .",
    "the reason for this is that the coefficient of @xmath80 in the expression for @xmath43 increases as a function of @xmath49 , and thus the minimal fine - tuned region requires the value of @xmath7 to decrease as @xmath49 increases .",

    "the contribution from @xmath50 is smaller than those from @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath83 because the value of @xmath31 is comparatively small and also because there are no cross - terms in the ft expression that involve @xmath31 and other ( large ) soft parameters .",

    "another interesting possibility is the direct pair - production of the heavier stop @xmath162 . since the two physical stop masses are split by a large amount , the decay mode @xmath163 is kinematically allowed and has a sizeable branching ratio @xcite .",

    "detecting this signature would give evidence for the maximal - mixing scenario but requires a large integrated luminosity ( at least @xmath47(100 fb@xmath169 ) ) @xcite .",

    "an alternative way to measure the parameters in the stop - sector is to use the higgs boson as a probe @xcite .",

    "taking into account the known parameters in the minimization procedure would most likely lead to other mft values for all parameters , including mft values for the known parameters which would in all likelihood not match the experimental values .    if the goal , however , is to find the ft of a given model , one should in principle include contributions from experimentally known parameters .",
    "for example , ft with respect to @xmath173 , @xmath174 , may give a large contribution to the total ft due to the large top mass .",

    "furthermore it breaks a @xmath177- and a @xmath178-symmetry and consequently does not feed back into any other @xmath36-functions since no other parameter breaks both symmetries .",
    "thus @xmath41 can not appear in equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz1 ] ) and is therefore completely free , which allows @xmath35 to be chosen accordingly as discussed in section [ sec : ewsb ] .",
    "the ft of @xmath30 has not been taken into account in the minimization procedure since an explicit expression for @xmath43 can only be obtained assuming a specific value for @xmath30 , because @xmath173 depends on @xmath30 through @xmath20 . moreover , since @xmath30 is then a free parameter the approximation leading to equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) may not be valid anymore and @xmath40 should be reintroduced .",

    "shows the well - known fact that the higher - order corrections to @xmath14 are extremely important .",
    "there are two additional very striking features .",
    "first of all , as @xmath185 increases and approaches 120 gev , the ft increases enormously . any further small increase in the higgs mass results in an exponentially large increase in the ft .",
    "the reason is that as @xmath185 approaches 120 gev here , it only grows logarithmically as a function of the stop masses .",
    "the stop masses therefore become exponentially large and thus increase the ft exponentially ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the second striking feature of this curve is that the value of the higgs mass at which the ft starts to increase exponentially is rather low ( the mft is already @xmath186 for @xmath187 gev ) .",
    "this value of @xmath14 may be increased by just under 2 gev by choosing larger @xmath30 and @xmath35 ( recall that throughout this discussion @xmath45 and @xmath46 gev ) .",
    "note that the latest tevatron top mass value ( @xmath20 = 170.9 gev ) has been used in the calculation , and a slightly different value can also change @xmath14 by a few gev .",
    "an obvious question is whether the mft region is significantly different if @xmath185 were used in the minimization procedure instead of @xmath180 ( the former is too complicated to be used ) . for mssm spectra that give small @xmath14",
    "this is certainly not the case , since there is not a very large discrepancy between the two higgs mass estimates @xmath180 and @xmath185 .",
    "the difference between the two higgs mass estimates becomes significant , however , for mssm spectra that give a large @xmath14 , and the approximation @xmath185 can be substantially smaller than @xmath180 .",
    "also , as mentioned above , @xmath185 can be substantially larger for positive @xmath10 ( near maximal mixing ) than for negative @xmath10 ( near `` natural '' maximal mixing ) , and increases as the chargino masses decrease .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath180 remains unaffected by the sign of @xmath10 and the size of the chargino masses .",
    "it is thus possible that the mft region does not coincide with the region obtained in the above minimization procedure as the lower bound on @xmath14 increases .",
    "this is indeed the case , as will now be discussed .",
    "calculated with @xmath15 2.6.0 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 gev , @xmath179 gev ) . throughout this paper",
    "the fine - tuning is minimized subject to a constraint on @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is estimated with a one - loop formula as described in section [ sec : mftprocedure ] .",

    "these low - energy spectra may then be used in @xmath15 to calculate @xmath14 . although @xmath6 , @xmath31 and the sign of @xmath10 do not affect the one - loop estimate of @xmath14 which only contains the dominant corrections",
    ", they do affect the @xmath15 estimate of @xmath14 . for the solid black line no constraint was set on @xmath10 , and @xmath31 and @xmath6",
    "were only required to be above 100 gev .",
    "it is the same line as in figure [ fig : ft_vs_mh_oneloop ] , but with @xmath14 estimated by @xmath15 instead of the one - loop formula .",
    "the dashed blue line assumes @xmath10 is positive and near maximal mixing , also with @xmath6 and @xmath31 only required to be above 100 gev .",

    "further details and explanations are given in the text .",
    "[ fig : ft_vs_mh ] ]    the ft may be minimized with the constraint that the chargino masses are small .",
    "since the effect of varying @xmath31 and @xmath6 on the ft are noticeable but not substantial , the resulting spectrum will be characterized by gluino and stop masses that are only slightly larger than those obtained in the mft region discussed in this paper .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is still negative .",
    "this spectrum may be used to calculate @xmath185 .",
    "the result is shown by the dash - dot green curve in figure [ fig : ft_vs_mh ] .",
    "for @xmath185 not too large , the solid black curve lies below the dash - dot green curve because the mft region has large values of @xmath6 , see section [ sec : mmit ] .",
    "as @xmath185 increases further , however , the ft becomes exponentially large since the stop masses become exponentially large .",
    "smaller chargino masses lead to larger values of @xmath185 , and the two curves show that for @xmath14 just below 120 gev , a smaller ft may be obtained by decreasing the size of @xmath6 . this behavior can not be captured by @xmath180 which is unaffected by a change in the chargino masses .",
    "note that the transition between the two regions described by the two curves is smooth , and that it occurs when the mft is already more than 1@xmath11 .",
    "next , the ft may be minimized with the constraint that @xmath10 is positive and near maximal mixing .",
    "the resulting low - energy spectrum is characterized by small chargino and gluino masses .",

    "it is clear that for small @xmath185 the mft region has negative values of @xmath10 .",
    "even though negative @xmath10 might be expected to always give less ft than positive @xmath10 due to the ir quasi - fixed point , the increase in @xmath185 by several gev by making @xmath10 positive is substantial , and as @xmath185 approaches about 123 gev , the two curves cross .",
    "thus , there is a transition from @xmath10 @xmath29 @xmath16 to @xmath10 @xmath29 @xmath17 of the minimal fine - tuned region as @xmath185 increases .",
    "this behavior is again not captured by @xmath180 which is independent of the sign of @xmath10 .",
    "the transition occurs when the minimal ft is already quite large ( about 0.2@xmath11 ) .",
    "this transition from negative to positive @xmath10 is not smooth , in the sense that the first derivative of the curve at the transition point is not continuous . to show this ,",
    "the ft may be minimized with the constraint @xmath190 .",
    "the resulting low - energy spectrum may then again be used to calculate @xmath185 , and the result is shown by the dotted red line in figure [ fig : ft_vs_mh ] .",
    "the value of @xmath185 for vanishing stop - mixing , @xmath190 , is much lower than for the two maximal mixing scenarios , @xmath191 , and it is clear that the mft region does not interpolate smoothly between them as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the main point of the analysis in this section is that although the mssm is already fine - tuned at least at about the @xmath18 level ( if the messenger scale equals the gut scale ) , there is not much room left for the higgs mass to increase before the ft becomes exponentially worse",
    ".    note that for a lower messenger scale the higgs mass can have a slightly larger value before the mft begins to increase enormously .",
    "for example , for @xmath49 = 200 tev , the mft is 1@xmath11 for @xmath192 gev .",
    "so even for a lower messenger scale the higgs mass can not be that much beyond 120 gev before the mft increases dramatically .",
    "this paper presented the minimally tuned minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mtmssm ) .",
    "the mssm parameter region that has the minimal model - independent fine - tuning ( ft ) of ewsb was found .",
    "model - independent means that no relations were assumed between the soft susy breaking parameters at the scale at which they are generated , here referred to as the messenger scale .",
    "instead , all of the important parameters were allowed to be independent and free at the messenger scale , and were taken to contribute to the total ft of the ewsb scale . the messenger scale itself was varied between 2 tev and @xmath2 and the effect of this on the minimal ft was presented .",
    "the most important parameters that contribute to the tuning are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the gaugino masses @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the stop soft masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the stop soft trilinear coupling @xmath10 . the mssm spectra which lead to the minimal model - independent ft were found by numerically minimizing the ft expression subject to constraints on the higgs , stop , and gaugino masses ( the higgs mass was found to always be the most important low - energy constraint ) .",
    "the high - energy spectra are characterized by tachyonic stop soft masses , even for messenger scales as low as 2 tev ( but note that threshold effects in the rg - running were neglected throughout ) .",
    "the potential existence of charge and/or color breaking minima turns out not to be a problem .",
    "the gluino mass , @xmath7 , is much smaller than the wino mass , @xmath6 , and @xmath6 in turn is much smaller than the bino mass @xmath5 .",
    "the low - scale spectra are characterized by negative @xmath10 near the maximal mixing scenario that maximizes the higgs mass .",
    "the large stop mixing leads to a large splitting between the two stop mass eigenstates .",
    "interesting phenomenological signatures include the possibility of a stop lsp .",
    "the minimal ft was also found as a function of the lower bound on the higgs mass ( with the messenger scale set to @xmath2 ) .",
    "although in the numerical minimization procedure the dominant one - loop expression for @xmath14 was used as a constraint , the resulting least fine - tuned spectra were used to calculate @xmath14 more accurately with @xmath15 .",
    "a plot of the minimal ft as a function of @xmath14 was presented .",
    "there are several striking features of this plot . for @xmath14 larger than about 120 gev",
    "the ft increases very rapidly .",
    "this value of @xmath14 is rather low , perhaps surprisingly so .",
    "it is only slightly dependent on the parameters in the higgs sector .",
    "near it , the value of @xmath10 in the least ft region also makes a sudden transition from lying near @xmath16 to lying near @xmath17 , where @xmath13 is the average of the two stop soft masses .",
    "the upshot of this particular analysis is that although the mssm is already fine - tuned at least at about the @xmath18 level ( if the messenger scale equals the gut scale ) , there is not much room left for the higgs mass to increase before the ft becomes exponentially worse .    * acknowledgements *    we thank s.  thomas for suggesting this problem and for many enlightening and useful discussions .",

    "threshold corrections are neglected when solving the rg - equations .",
    "the main goal is to obtain an expression for @xmath43 in terms of high - scale input parameters as in equation ( [ eqn : mzsq generic ] ) . assuming that @xmath30 is not too small , this requires solving @xmath195 and @xmath196 in terms of high - scale parameters ( for moderate values of @xmath30 , @xmath40 may be neglected , see equation ( [ eqn : ewsbmz2 ] ) ) .",
    "the fine - tuning may then be calculated and naturally expressed in terms of high - scale parameters as in equation ( [ eqn : ftdefn ] ) . however , in order to minimize the fine - tuning taking into account low - scale constraints on the higgs , stop , and gaugino masses , it is more appropriate to rewrite the fine - tuning expression in terms of low scale parameters .",
