    "in statistical mechanics , the boltzmann distribution @xcite is used indiscriminately in two kinds of situations . in the first situation , it deals with a single particle ( or a system ) in contact with a thermal reservoir of temperature @xmath0 and says that the probability to find the particle with energy @xmath1 is @xmath2 .",
    "we call this distribution the boltzmann distribution of the first kind , which always holds because it is directly related to the definition of _ temperature_.    in the second situation , the boltzmann distribution deals with many particles in an external potential field @xmath3 . and",
    "it says @xcite that for the equilibrium state the particle number density is @xmath4 .",
    "we call this distribution the boltzmann distribution of the second kind , which is an extension of the boltzmann distribution of the first kind",
    ".    meanwhile , the particle number density ought to be determined by the principle of detailed balance @xcite , which alway holds because it directly relates to the nature of _",
    "equilibrium_. according to the principle of detailed balance , the particle number density @xmath5 should be determined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the transition probabilities which should be derived from the microscopic dynamics of the particles .",
    "the boltzmann distribution of the second kind does not reflect the microscopic dynamics of the particles .",
    "so it can be in conflict with the principle of detailed balance in some models .",
    "we will go through three models and compare them .",
    "the first two models have microscopic dynamics of classical mechanics .",
    "the third model has microscopic dynamics of quantum mechanics .",
    "the first two models will produce the boltzmann distribution of the second kind .",
    "the third model will produce a result violating it .",
    "note that some other works @xcite also suggested possible violations of the boltzmann distribution of the second kind .",
    "we first examine a dilute gas in a gravitational field . according to the barometric formula @xcite",
    ", the molecular number density follows the boltzmann distribution of the second kind .",
    "in fact , all this is a result of the principle of detailed balance .",
    "figure  [ gas_random ] shows a dilute gas in a gravitational field .",
    "the dilute gas is in an equilibrium state .",
    "then the temperature is uniform @xcite , and the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution applies @xcite .",
    "let us examine two cross sections at heights @xmath9 and @xmath10 and study only in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "this is a one - dimensional situation .",
    "the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution function becomes @xmath11 .",
    "we focus on those processes involving no collisions .",
    "if a molecule at @xmath9 is able to reach @xmath10 , it must have a velocity @xmath12 .",
    "so the corresponding transition probability is @xmath13 if a molecule at @xmath10 is able to reach @xmath9 directly , its velocity just needs to point downward .",
    "so the corresponding transition probability is @xmath14 a calculation can show that @xmath15 putting it into the principle of detailed balance @xmath16 , we get @xmath17 this is the boltzmann distribution of the second kind , and it remains the same when those processes involving collisions are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the same discussion can be applied to a dilute gas of charged particles in an electric field .",
    "the discussion about a dilute gas does not apply to interstitial ions in a rigid crystal .",
    "but if the microscopic dynamics of the ionic conduction is of classical mechanics , the principle of detailed balance still leads to the boltzmann distribution of the second kind .",
    "figure  [ ions ] shows a solid ionic conductor .    , width=113 ]    interstitial ions can jump from site to site . according to classical mechanics @xcite ,",
    "an ion can only jump when it can pass over a surrounding potential peak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ peak ] .",
    "so the ion must wait till it happens to have an energy high enough .    before an electric field",
    "is applied , an ion has the same probability to jump to the right or the left . after the electric field is applied as shown in fig .",
    "[ gap ] , the ion is more likely to jump to the right ,        for which it just needs to have an energy @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the activation energy , @xmath20 is the ion s charge and @xmath21 is the electric field . then the corresponding transition probability is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the boltzmann distribution of the first kind . for the ion to jump to the left , it needs to have an energy @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding transition probability is @xmath25 a calculation can show that @xmath26 we can also introduce @xmath27 .",
    "and obviously we have @xmath28 .",
    "so we have @xmath29 .",
    "putting it into the principle of detailed balance @xmath30 , we get @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the ion number densities at sites @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "this is the boltzmann distribution of the second kind .",
    "but it will be violated if the microscopic dynamics of the ionic conduction is of quantum mechanics .",
    "the energy of an ion at a given site is quantized as einstein proposed in his work @xcite about the specific heats of solids .",
    "so the ion is in a quantum state . then according to quantum mechanics ,",
    "the ion can take a _",
    "jump _ via quantum tunnelling @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ quantum ] .",
    "let us use @xmath36 to denote the quantum state of the ion staying at the site 0 and in the ground state .",
    "similarly , we introduce @xmath37 and @xmath38 . then according to fermi s golden rule , the probability per unit of time of the ion tunnelling from 0 to @xmath35 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) is the hamiltonian and @xmath42 is the density of states , which is determined by the conductor .",
    "we denote the density of states of the conductor by @xmath43 for the most probable energy . through the tunnelling process",
    ", the conductor will gain energy @xmath44 , so its density of states will become @xmath45 ( see appendix  [ aa ] ) .",
    "so we have @xmath46 similarly , we get the probability per unit of time of the ion tunnelling from @xmath34 to @xmath47 , @xmath48 where the conductor loses energy @xmath44 .",
    "according to quantum mechanics , if an ion can tunnel from 0 to @xmath35 , it can also tunnel from @xmath35 to 0 .",
    "the two processes are time reversal to each other , and their hamiltonian matrix element are complex conjugate to each other , @xmath49 . and , for a large conductor , we can use discrete translational symmetry to have @xmath50 .",
    "so we have @xmath51",
    ". then we have @xmath52 then the ratio of the corresponding transition probabilities is @xmath53 let us further introduce @xmath27 and use @xmath28 .",
    "then we have @xmath54 .",
    "putting it into the principle of detailed balance @xmath30 , we get @xmath55    if we take @xmath56-direction to be the opposite of the direction of the electric field and take the continuum limit , we have @xmath57 this distribution is different from the boltzmann distribution of the second kind by a factor of 2 . we know that the boltzmann distribution of the second kind leads to the nernst - einstein relation @xcite @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath60 is the ion mobility . now that the boltzmann distribution of the second kind is violated by a factor of 2 ,",
    "the nernst - einstein relation @xcite would become @xmath61 in fact , it has been found in experiments that the nernst - einstein relation for ionic conduction is not exact , for which a parameter called haven ratio has been introduced .",
    "the factor @xmath62 in relation ( [ oneovertwo ] ) means a haven ratio 0.5 , which is consistent with most experiments @xcite .",
    "though quantum tunnelling can happen beyond of the ground state , the result is the same ( see appendix  [ ab ] ) .",
    "the author is very grateful to bin zhang and roberto trasarti - battistoni for many discussions .",
    "since the conductor is a macroscopic object , its energy eigenvalues can be considered as continuous .",
    "the energy of the conductor @xmath63 fluctuates around the most probable energy @xmath64 within a narrow range .",
    "we denote the conductor s density of states by @xmath65 and use @xmath43 to stand for @xmath66 . then by using the boltzmann distribution of the first kind , we know that the probability to find the conductor to have energy @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath67    the most probable energy @xmath64 is determined by @xmath68=0 $ ] , which leads to @xmath69 so for a small change of energy @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 note that @xmath65 is not necessarily the overall density of states of the entire conductor and can be just a relevant part of it .",
    "we use @xmath72 to denote the quantum state of the ion at the site 0 , where @xmath73 labels the energy eigenvalue and @xmath74 labels the eigenstate .",
    "similarly , we introduce @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that all this is an approximation .",
    "a quantum tunnelling may happen between any two eigenstates .",
    "for a given initial eigenstate @xmath72 , we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the ion energy eigenvalues , which should be lower than the activation energy @xmath19 .      combining ( [ mam ] ) with ( [ p0 ] ) and ( [ pma ] ) , we get @xmath87 then we can count and sum all the possible final states to get @xmath88 for the initial state of the ion at site 0 , we introduce @xmath89 to denote the probability to find it in an eigenstate @xmath72",
