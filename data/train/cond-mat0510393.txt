    "in the human body alone , the number of different proteins is estimated to be in the range of 50,000 - 100,000 and this number is even larger in the biological world . however , when classified in terms of their three dimensional structures , only 1000 families of protein folds are expected to exist @xcite . these structural templates for sequences of amino acids",
    "can be explained @xcite in terms of minimalistic models where the positions of amino acids are restricted to lattice sites and the interaction energy between residues is described by a coarse - grained model . in this minimalistic approach",
    ", structures are classified according to their designability , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of amino acid sequences they can accommodate . while some structures are not used to describe proteins , _",
    "i.e. _ their designability is zero , a few structures are designed by an enormous number of sequences and are , therefore , stable to amino acid mutation  a desirable and natural feature for evolution .",
    "also , highly designable structures emerge as being thermodynamically stable @xcite and having protein - like symmetry @xcite .",
    "designability has also been shown to have dynamical implications :  calculations suggest @xcite that sequences of amino acids that fold into highly designable structures , and are thermodynamically stable , present a faster folding kinetics than random sequences  as expected for real proteins .",
    "another important dynamical aspect of proteins is their reaction to external force fields :  in their natural environment , proteins have to cope with forces during their activities . it might be expected that the set of structures which constitute recurring protein folds react differently to forces than other folds . in this paper",
    "we confirm this expectation .",
    "we study the dependence of the phase diagram on designability and show that _ for any combination of temperature and shear , high - designable structures are the easiest structures to unfold_. this result is a consequence of how the backbone ( involving strong covalent bonds ) and weak bonds are distributed in these structures .    this article is organized as follow : below we review the relation between designability , thermodynamic stability and surface - to - core bonds . following this , the model to study unfolding",
    "is introduced , together with the mathematical framework to characterize this process .",
    "results are then presented , followed by a discussion .",
    "the goal of this section is to review the relation between designability and thermodynamical stability for the hydrophobic - polar ( hp ) model in the two - dimensional compact triangular lattice @xcite which describes equilibrium structures of our protein model in the next section . in the hp model",
    "@xcite a protein is considered to be a chain made of polar ( p ) and hydrophobic ( h ) like amino acids .",
    "hydrophobicity is the only aspect of amino acids which is taken into account since it is considered the main driving force for folding @xcite . in this coarse - grained approach",
    "the energy of a sequence folded into a structure is given by the short - range contact interaction : @xmath0 \\label{eqn : hamilton}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the position of the @xmath2 monomer and @xmath3 is distance between lattice sites .",
    "the first delta function allows only nearest - neighbors interaction and the second delta excludes interaction between residues which are adjacent along the backbone .",
    "the interaction energy between monomers @xmath2 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , can assume 3 values depending on the type of monomers bounded : h - h , h - p , p - p . these values are chosen to minimize the hamiltonian when h like amino acids are buried inside the protein and p like amino acids are left on the surface .",
    "following li _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we use : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these values are given in arbitrary units .",
    "in this work , proteins are 25 amino acids long and the different structures they can assume are restricted to compact self - avoiding walks on a 5 x 5 triangular lattice ",
    "[ fig : designability](d ) for an example of structure .",
    "the number of independent structures that can be formed under these conditions is 352,375 .",
    "now , given a sequence of amino acids , each structure can be scanned for its native state ",
    "_ i.e. _ its non - degenerate ground state .",
    "sequences with degenerate ground states are believed to be unrealistic since their native states are not well defined .",
    "these sequences are therefore ignored . for our small protein ,",
    "the ground state of all its @xmath9 binary sequences can be computed and we count the number of sequences that fold uniquely into a structure .",
    "this number corresponds to the designability of the given structure .",
    "we find that among the 352,375 structures only 135,216 ( @xmath10 ) are non - degenerate ground states of at least one sequence .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the distribution of designability for the 135,216 structures",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : designability](a ) . compact structures are very different when in comes to designability : many structures have a low value of designability , while just a rare number of folds accommodate more than 500 sequences .",
    "these high - designable structures are on average more stable thermodynamically than other structures .",
    "this can be shown by computing the energy difference between the ground state @xmath11 and the first excited state @xmath12 of a sequence : @xmath13 .",
    "this energy difference is then averaged over sequences that have the same ground state and it is a measure of the stability of the given ground state .",
    "the correlation between @xmath14 and designability is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : designability](b ) where @xmath14 is averaged over a given range of designabilities .",
    "a geometrical property of these selected structures is the large number of bonds connecting surface monomers to core monomers @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : designability](c ) where the number of bonds connecting surface to core , averaged over structures of a given range of designability , is plotted against designability . a systematic increase of surface - to - core bonds with designability is observed .",
    "an example of structure which has a large number of bonds connecting surface to core residue is the fifth most designable structure - shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : designability](d ) .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the surface of high - designable structures is differently connected to the core of the protein when compared to the surface of low - designable structures  fig .",
    "[ fig : designability](c ) .",
    "therefore , since unfolding starts by unbinding surface monomers from the core , it might be expected that the dynamics of unfolding depends on designability . to investigate this idea , we present in this section a model to probe the dynamics of structures in the presence of applied forces .    in this model",
    ", the energy of each structure is accounted for by two types of potentials :  monomers which are adjacent along the backbone of the protein interact through a harmonic potential otherwise the interaction is via a lennard - jones potential .",
    "the harmonic bond ensures that the backbone of the protein is preserved during the simulation while monomers bound by a lennard - jones potential can be driven apart , changing the structure of the protein . in this way , the potential energy of the chain is : @xmath15 \\label{eqn : potenergy}\\ ] ] in the last sum , _",
    "i _ and _ j _ range from 1 to n and @xmath16 is the distance between monomers _",
    "j_. @xmath17 and @xmath3 are the binding energy and equilibrium length of monomers .",
    "a cut - off distance of @xmath18 is used for the lennard - jones potential and _ k _ is the spring constant of the harmonic potential .",
    "notice that the model does not discriminate between p and h amino acids such that the dynamics of unfolding can be related directly to the topology of the native structure independently of amino acids sequences .",
    "each of the 135,216 designable structures described in the previous section corresponds to a local minima of this potential energy and they can be viewed as _ equilibrium structures_.    the fluid is modeled by including a friction and a random term @xmath19 to the force acting on each monomer ( langevin dynamics ) .",
    "the intensity of the random force is given by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the friction force on each monomer is proportional to the relative velocity of the monomer with respect to the fluid : @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the friction coefficient ) . for the velocity of an element of the fluid located at position @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 , we use the velocity profile : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the shear rate .",
    "inside such a fluid flow , an extended elastic object rotates and gets stretched with an intensity dependent on its orientation with respect to the fluid flow .    putting the forces that act on a monomer together , its equation of motion inside the elongational flow",
    "is : @xmath26 + \\vec{f}_i(t ) \\label{eqn : eqnmotion}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the vectors representing the position and velocity of monomer _",
    "i_. here , @xmath29 is the mass of a monomer , @xmath30 is the force computed from the interacting potential . for simplicity , @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath29 are chosen to be one . the spring is chosen to be five times stiffer than the lennard - jones potential :  @xmath31 .",
    "simulations are carried out in units of the fastest atomic vibration :  @xmath32 ; and the friction constant is given a value of :  @xmath33 .",
    "now we quantitatively evaluate how structures with differing designabilities react to both thermal fluctuations and an applied shear force . rather than simulate all 135,216 structures , we sample as follows .",
    "we study all the 1500 structures with highest designability , ranging from 200 to 700 . for",
    "the more numerous structures which are less designable , we consider eight randomly - chosen structures for each designability .",
    "this ensemble of 3100 structures is representative of the diversity of folds .",
    "here we study how structures differing in designability react to an applied shear force . at zero temperature",
    ", a structure only unfolds if the shear rate is greater than @xmath34 - _ i.e. _ when the barrier is zero . therefore if ( at zero temperature ) a structure does not unfold at a given @xmath35 but unfolds at @xmath36 , the critical shear @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 being a numerical parameter accounting for the precision of the calculation .",
    "the simulational time was 5,000 atomic vibrations . to be statistically significant",
    "we probe eight copies of each structure to different values ( all differing by @xmath39 ) of the velocity flow  each copy having a different orientations with respect to the fluid .",
    "notice that @xmath34 is proportional to the stability of a structure .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainresult](a ) where the dependence of @xmath34 on the number of times the backbone connects a surface to a core monomer is shown .",
    "_ structures with a backbone zigzagging many times between surface and core are sensitive to small gradients in contrast to more linear backbone structures . _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainresult](b ) we illustrate the dependence of @xmath34 on designability . in this figure",
    ", both @xmath34 and designability has been averaged over structures having the same number of surface - to - core bonds . _",
    "a clear correlation between these quantities indicates that structures which are highly designable require less shear to unfold . _      in this subsection",
    "we are concerned with thermally induced unfolding .",
    "therefore the shear rate of our model is set to zero such that the only cause of unfolding is thermal fluctuations .",
    "we compute the unfolding time of the ensemble of 3100 structures at a temperature of 0.50 ( in units of @xmath17 ) . in our simulations , the unfolding time @xmath40 is computed by tracking the population of folded chains .",
    "the number of chains that unfold at time @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is proportional to the population of folded chains @xmath43 . in this case , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the rate of unfolding and the characteristic unfolding time is given by the inverse of the rate @xmath46 .",
    "we use 1,000 copies ( _ i.e. _ @xmath47 ) of each structure in the simulations .",
    "the larger the unfolding time of a structure , the more stable it is to thermal fluctuations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalunfolding](a ) the unfolding time is plotted versus the number of surface - to - core bonds . the clear downward trend of this figure indicates that _ structures with many surface - to - core bonds unfold faster_. figure [ fig : thermalunfolding](b ) presents the correlation between unfolding time and designability .",
    "this figure was obtained by averaging both time of unfolding and designability over structures having the same number of surface - to - core bonds .",
    "again a clear correlation indicates that on average , _ structures with low designability are more robust to thermal fluctuations_.      we now study how the designability of a protein affects its phase - diagram .",
    "this diagram is constructed by computing the applied shear rate required to unfold a structure in @xmath48 units of time at different temperatures .",
    "this shear rate is then averaged over structures having the same number of surface - to - core bonds .",
    "notice that the computed shear delimits two regions of the diagram :  folded structures are found below this shear and unfolded structures above it . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] the phase - diagram is shown for structures having 4 and 15 surface - to - core bonds .",
    "these two sets of structures have an average designability of 59.71 and 299.55 respectively . at any temperature ,",
    "the set of structures with lower designability is more robust and require a higher shear rate to unfold .",
    "_ one can therefore state that high designable structures are easier to unfold than low designable ones_.",
    "the relation between thermodynamical stability and designability , called the designability principle , has been shown in fig.[fig : designability](b ) :  highly designable structures are more stable thermodynamically than low designable ones .",
    "in marked contrast to the designability principle , we have shown that highly designable structures are easier to unfold than low designable ones  _ i.e. _ they are weaker .",
    "the implication is that , although highly designable structures are more stable in the folded region of the phase diagram , they require less perturbation to unfold . we speculate this may be related to protein flexibility .",
    "a qualitative explanation is as follow .",
    "we have shown that highly designable structures are weaker due to the large number of surface - to - core bonds they contain .",
    "consequently , these structures contain many small domains ( _ i.e. _ sub - structures ) .",
    "these are easy to unfold :  only a few bonds need to rupture in order to separate the domains .",
    "in contrast , low designable structures have few surface to core bonds . as a result , many weak bonds are aligned forming domains where monomers are correlated over long distances . for those structures , the time of unfolding is dominated by the slow unbinding of the largest domain . therefore , these low designable structures can be said to be stronger .",
    "also , the presence in large number of surface - to - core bonds makes it difficult to transform highly designable structures into other distinct compact shapes through local rearrangements of the backbone @xcite .",
    "such a transformation would require the partial unfolding of the structure , which is unlikely in the region of the phase diagram where folded structures are at equilibrium , followed by folding into the new shape . therefore , the presence of surface - to - core bonds might explain why high designable structures are thermodynamically stable but easier to unfolding .",
    "finally , we expect interesting insights to be obtained by expanding the model to three dimensions and including hydrodynamics effects ( _ i.e. _ modeling the solvent explicitly ) ."
