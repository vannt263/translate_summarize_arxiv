    "numerical studies indicate that primordial stars form in the first pregalactic objects to reach masses of @xmath7 5 @xmath1 10@xmath14 @xmath15 at @xmath0 20 - 50 @xcite .",
    "the models suggest that population iii stars form in isolation ( one per halo ) and that they are likely very massive , from 100 to 500 @xmath15 .",
    "more recent work surveying a larger sample of halos @xcite extends the lower mass limit of primordial stars down to 15 @xmath15 .",
    "very massive stars easily photoionize their halos , typically in a few hundred kyr with final region radii of 2500 - 5000 pc while regions of less massive stars are confined to very small radii ( @xmath16 10@xmath17 pc ) by the high central densities deep in the halo @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "high recombination rates and pressure from overlying matter due to the depth of the halo dark matter potential well halts the expansion of the heated bubble @xcite . unlike massive stars in the galaxy today , little mass loss occurs in population iii stars because there are no line - driven winds from their pristine atmospheres @xcite , although mixing in rapidly rotating stars may cause some mass loss later in their lives @xcite .",
    "consequently , winds do not clear gas from cosmological halos in the first generation of stars as they do from molecular cloud cores today .",
    "however , if the ionization front ( i - front ) of the star breaks out of the halo it will sweep more than half of the baryons interior to the virial radius into a thick shell @xmath7 100 pc in radius by the end of the life of the star @xcite . the diffuse gas enclosed by the shell",
    "is uniform and at densities far lower than in the original halo , 0.1 - 1 cm@xmath17 instead of more than 10@xmath19 cm@xmath17 .",
    "the ultimate fate of a population iii star depends on its mass at the end of its main sequence lifetime ( msl ) .",
    "those lying between 10 @xmath15 and 40 @xmath15 die in type ii supernova explosions , ejecting roughly 20% of their mass into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) as metals and leaving behind a compact remnant .",
    "stars between 140 @xmath15 and 260 @xmath15 explode in extremely energetic pair instability supernovae ( pisn ) hundreds of times more powerful @xcite .",
    "as much as 50% of the mass of the star is dispersed as heavy elements into the igm in such events , with no compact remnant .",
    "however , these predictions are based on one - dimensional non - rotating stellar evolution models that make a range of assumptions ( e.  g. mixing parameters ) and should be considered qualitative , rather than quantitative , in nature .",
    "how far elements are expelled from the star depends strongly on the state of the halo prior to the explosion .",
    "supernova ( sn ) remnants in halos completely ionized by the star typically expand to half the diameter of the h ii region .",
    "the shock front comes into pressure equilibrium with the hot recombining gas more quickly than if the blast propagates in a neutral medium of comparable density @xcite .",
    "supernovae in neutral halos , which result when low - mass population iii stars fail to ionize them , evolve quite differently . because no winds evacuate gas from the center of the halo , the blast encounters circumstellar densities several orders of magnitude greater than in ob associations in the galaxy , with much higher energy losses at very early times .",
    "since the blast energy is much greater than the binding energy of the gas in the halo , it is often supposed that pisn easily destroyed halos . here ,",
    "destruction of the halo means complete expulsion of its gas , not dispersal of the dark matter itself , which remains mostly undisturbed .",
    "however , as @xcite point out , this argument ignores radiative losses from the shock in the large densities deep in the halo .",
    "they find that bremsstrahlung and inverse compton cooling ( ic ) radiate away the explosion s energy before it even sweeps up its own mass in ambient gas , quenching the blast and preventing any dissemination of metals into the halo .",
    "explosions with hundreds of times the binding energy may be necessary to disperse more massive halos under these conditions .    however , a difficulty with this and other studies of primordial supernovae in cosmological halos is how the explosion itself is initialized .",
    "this is typically done by depositing the energy of the blast as thermal energy on the mesh and allowing pressure gradients to launch shocked flows into their surroundings @xcite .",
    "this is partly justified for explosions in regions whose central densities are quite low and in which early radiative losses from the remnant are minimal .",
    "too much energy loss from the early remnant would be ignored by this approach for sn in neutral halos , which cool strongly from very early times due to high ambient densities .",
    "in fact , explosions initialized by thermal pulses in neutral halos cool before any of their energy can be converted into motion @xcite . when the energy of the blast is deposited as heat to central mesh zones , their temperatures skyrocket to tens of billions of degrees",
    "k , driving extreme bremsstrahlung and ic losses before pressure gradients can accelerate any flows .",
    "these initial conditions do not properly represent the free expansion that actually erupts through the stellar envelope and whose momentum can not be radiated away .",
    "the early stages of the explosion in a nearly undisturbed halo are much better modeled by a cold free expansion in which the energy of the blast is kinetic rather than thermal .",
    "furthermore , supernovae modeled in cosmological density fields with smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods @xcite also lack the numerical resolution to capture the early hydrodynamic behavior of the blast wave .",
    "dynamical instabilities might manifest that lead to early mixing of heavy elements in the ejecta with ambient halo material on much earlier time scales than in current simulations .",
    "how easily neutral halos are destroyed by primordial supernovae and how metals mix with the early igm thus remains unclear .",
    "one key issue is how much gas is displaced in the halo by the momentum of the ejecta after its energy is lost to cooling processes in the expanding flow at early times . in regions the shock later strongly interacts with the dense shell of ionized gas expanding within the region .",
    "how well do metals in the remnant mix with the dense shell , and if dynamical instabilities arise that fragment the shock into enriched clumps , are they liable to collapse into new stars ?",
    "numerical simulations excluding these phenomenon indicate that metals do not significantly mix with the igm until gas falls back into the dark matter potential after about a hubble time @xcite .    capturing the true evolution of the blast",
    "presents numerical challenges due to the spatial scales at play . to accurately represent the initial ejecta as a free expansion",
    ", its hydrodynamical profile can not extend beyond radii that enclose more surrounding gas than ejecta mass . in the high central densities of neutral halos",
    "such radii are 5 @xmath1 10@xmath6 - 1 @xmath1 10@xmath17 pc , but the blast must then be evolved to tens or hundreds of parsecs to evaluate its true impact on the halo .",
    "furthermore , multiple sites of intense luminosity will erupt in the flow over all these scales from the earliest times , so the chemistry of the flow must be solved consistently with hydrodynamics to determine where gas is collisionally ionized and therefore strongly radiating .",
    "the attendant time scales can restrict integration times to much lower values than courant times .    to address these questions",
    "we have performed one - dimensional models of type ii supernovae , hypernovae , and pisn in neutral and ionized cosmological halos at redshift 20 .",
    "our initial conditions are spherically - averaged halos derived from cosmological initial conditions with the enzo adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code @xcite that are photoionized by the star in the zeus - mp reactive flow radiative transfer code @xcite .",
    "the aim of our survey is to determine the explosion energies required to destroy cosmological halos that are thought to form primordial stars by h@xmath5 cooling .",
    "we also evaluate their observational signatures and how their metals will mix with the ambient medium as a prelude to three - dimensional amr calculations now in progress .",
    "our radiation hydrodynamics scheme and initial profiles for the free expansion are presented in @xmath20 2 .",
    "we also describe the expanding grids used in this study and the time - dependent boundary conditions that present the ambient medium to the expanding flow .",
    "region profiles for the explosions and the grid of supernova and halo models selected for this survey are outlined in @xmath20 3 .",
    "the evolution of blasts in both neutral halos and regions are examined together with dominant energy loss mechanisms for each case in @xmath20 4 .",
    "we discuss observational measures for both kinds of explosion in @xmath20 5 , chemical enrichment of baryons in the halos in @xmath20 6 and conclude in @xmath20 7 .",
    "three - dimensional halo baryon profiles computed from cosmological initial conditions are extracted from an enzo amr run and spherically averaged into one - dimensional density fields .",
    "these profiles are then photoionized over the main sequence lifetime of the sn progenitor with the zeus - mp astrophysical fluid hydrodynamics code .",
    "we then initialize one - dimensional explosion profiles in the ionized halos and evolve the blasts in a separate calculation .",
    "zeus - mp has been modified to solve explicit finite - difference approximations to euler s equations of fluid dynamics coupled to 9-species primordial chemistry with photoionization rate coefficients computed from multifrequency photon - conserving uv transport @xcite .",
    "the fluid equations are @xmath21 where @xmath22 , e , and the v@xmath23 are the mass density , internal energy density , and velocity components of each zone , and p = ( @xmath24 - 1 ) e and * q * are the gas pressure and the von neumann - richtmeyer artificial viscosity tensor @xcite .",
    "nine additional continuity equations are solved to advect h , h@xmath25 , he , he@xmath25 , he@xmath26 , h@xmath27 , h@xmath28 , h@xmath29 , and e@xmath27 , which are assumed to share a common velocity distribution .",
    "thirty reactions among these primordial species are followed with the nonequilibrium rate equations of @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the rate coefficient of the reaction between species j and k that creates ( + ) or removes ( - ) species i , and the @xmath32 are the ionization rates .",
    "the continuity equations for each reactant are updated in the advection routines and the reaction network is evolved in a separate operator - split semi - implicit substep .",
    "we enforce charge and baryon conservation at the end of each hydrodynamic cycle by assigning any error between the species or charge sums and @xmath22 to the largest of the species to bring them into agreement with @xmath22 .",
    "microphysical cooling and heating are included with an isochoric operator - split update to the energy density evaluated each time the reaction network is solved : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the rate at which photons at all frequencies in the calculation deposit heat into the gas as described in @xcite and @xmath35 is the sum of the cooling rates due to collisional ionization and excitation of h and he , recombinations in h and he , inverse compton scattering ( ic ) from the cmb , and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "h@xmath5 cooling @xcite",
    "is included in the region calculation but not in the evolution of the sn blast , whose high temperatures and strong shocks destroy the fragile hydrogen molecules on the time scales of our models .",
    "we do not include metal line cooling , but reserve it for three - dimensional models now in preparation .",
    "photon - conserving uv transport in the spherical polar coordinate grid used in this study is performed by solving the static approximation to the equation of radiative transfer in flux form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inverse mean free path of a uv photon in the neutral gas @xmath38 to compute the total absorption rate in each zone by photon conservation , which mandates that the number of absorptions in a zone is equal to the photons entering the zone minus those exiting each second . in terms of flux , this difference reduces to @xmath39 individual interaction rates ( photoionizations , photodetachments , and photodissociations ) are obtained from the total rate according to the prescription @xmath40 which are then converted into the photoionization rate coefficients required by the reaction network @xmath41 where n@xmath42 is the number density of the species with which the photons are interacting .",
    "we adopt the on - the - spot ( ots ) approximation by assuming that recombinations to the ground state balance photoionizations by diffuse photons within a zone , so we do not explicitly transport recombination radiation .",
    "complete descriptions of the photon conserving uv transport from which radiative rates in the reaction network are derived can be found in @xcite .",
    "we take density and velocity profiles for the free expansion from @xcite , where it is shown that at a given time the ejecta density can be approximated by a flat inner core and steeply declining outer edge :    @xmath43    @xmath44    here , @xmath22 is the density , @xmath45 is the time , @xmath46 is the velocity and @xmath47 is the radius . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are normalization constants which must be determined .",
    "the time dependence in the density is due to the expansion of the ejecta : as it grows in volume by @xmath50 its density decreases by @xmath51 .",
    "the inner region of the free expansion , @xmath52 , has a constant density and the outer region , @xmath53 , decreases by a power law with index @xmath54 .",
    "such profiles , with @xmath55 9 , are usually assumed for core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "the early evolution of the blast is insensitive to the choice of @xmath56 , unless it exceeds the radius enclosing an ambient mass greater than the ejecta mass .",
    "the two normalization constants , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are determined from the ejecta mass @xmath57 and energy @xmath58 .",
    "the energy is assumed to be entirely kinetic . to calculate these constants we first choose a maximum radius @xmath56 ( @xmath59 ) that defines the leading edge of the sn ejecta and a maximum velocity @xmath60 for the remnant .",
    "this radius is a free parameter and is usually set so that the enclosed baryonic mass in the halo equals @xmath57 .",
    "the maximum velocity is set to @xmath61 km / s , corresponding roughly to that observed in core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "we set @xmath62 0 in all our models .    to determine @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we first set @xmath63 , the time by which the leading edge of free expansion has self - silimilarly grown to @xmath56 , the initial radius we have chosen for the blast . using equations [ eq : sndens ] and [ eq : freeexp ] and choosing @xmath48 = 1 and @xmath49 to be some small arbitrary value , we perform the following integrations :    @xmath64    @xmath65    neither of these integrations will return correct values for @xmath57 and @xmath58 at first because @xmath48 and @xmath49 were arbitrarily chosen . selecting a new @xmath66 equal to @xmath57 divided by the mass obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : mej ] , which guarantees the first integration equals the correct ejecta mass by construction , we repeat the second integration and check if it is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "if so , @xmath66 and @xmath49 are those needed to construct the density profile .",
    "if not , we increase the value for @xmath49 , again set @xmath67 1 , obtain a new @xmath66 , which partly depends on the new @xmath49 , from the first integral , and then compute a new @xmath58 with the second integral .",
    "we repeat this two - step procedure until the latest choice of @xmath49 and @xmath66 returns the correct value of @xmath58 in the second integration ; the @xmath66 in this final cycle is the @xmath48 we apply to the density profile on the grid .",
    "once we have @xmath48 and v@xmath68 , and recalling that @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we recast eq [ eq : sndens ] as a function of @xmath47 in order to initialize densities on the grid .",
    "analytical expressions can be found for the normalization constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 without resorting to iteration in certain circumstances .",
    "equations ( [ eq : sndens ] ) and ( [ eq : freeexp ] ) can be substituted into equations ( [ eq : eej ] ) and ( [ eq : mej ] ) to obtain    @xmath71",
    "@xmath72    here , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 and @xmath56 are the minimum and maximum radius of the free expansion , respectively . if @xmath76 , which is generally true , then @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath77    @xmath78    we iterate to find @xmath48 and @xmath49 because the assumptions underlying the analytical forms might not be satisfied for all ejecta profiles discretized on a mesh . at times",
    "@xmath79 could lie close to the inner or outer boundary of the grid . in this case",
    "the analytical solution is different from the one found iteratively and could introduce errors in the mass and energy on the grid if applied . to prevent such errors we always solve for @xmath48 and @xmath49 numerically .      as noted earlier ,",
    "to realistically represent the early remnant as a free expansion in neutral halos it can not enclose more halo gas than its own mass in ejecta , which confines its initial extent to less than 0.001 pc if the halo .",
    "this restriction is problematic , given that its expansion must be accurately resolved out to the virial radius of the halo , @xmath7 100 pc .",
    "however , this can be accomplished with a fixed number of mesh points if the grid itself expands with the flow and always maintains its outer boundary beyond the expanding shock front . in this scenario",
    "only the surrounding halo just beyond the shock can be present on the grid at any time , so as the outer boundary of the grid grows with time its densities , energy , and velocities must be updated according to its given position within the halo . in this way",
    "the expanding flow always encounters the densities it would if the entire halo resided on the grid .",
    "an additional benefit is that courant times become longer as the grid grows , accelerating the execution of the calculation .",
    "we activate moving grids in the radial coordinate in zeus - mp for the models in this study , modifying the outer boundary conditions every hydrodynamical time step with an operator - split update following the calculation of a new grid . at the start of the simulation we allocate 80% of the mesh to the free expansion profile , reserving the outer 20% for the ambient halo .",
    "every time step thereafter the outer 10% of the grid is swept for the maximum radial gas velocity and its position on the mesh . a grid velocity describing homologous expansion",
    "is then assigned to each grid point such that the grid velocity at the radius of the previous maximum in gas velocity is three times this maximum .",
    "the factor of 3 guarantees that the flow never reaches the outer boundary , where inflow conditions are reset each time step to ensure the remnant always encounters the correct ambient medium .",
    "if the velocity of the grid is non - zero , the entire radial grid is updated in the following manner .",
    "first a new outer boundary is determined from the old boundary , the grid velocity and the current time step . a new grid",
    "is then computed such that the radial cells , whose number remains fixed , are redistributed equally over the new range in radius .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of zeus - mp s moving eulerian grid option .",
    "species densities , energies , and velocities on the outer boundary are updated each hydrodynamical time step by interpolating from a data table whose entries are binned by radius .",
    "the profiles in these tables are those of the halo photoionized by the original star over its main sequence lifetime , which were computed in the separate calculation with nine - species primordial chemistry and radiative transfer that was described above .",
    "the flow values assigned to the outer boundary depend upon the position bin into which the boundary falls at a given time step .",
    "we describe the stellar masses and halos used in our models in the following section .",
    "primordial supernova remnants evolved in much deeper gravitational potentials due to dark matter than sn in the galaxy today .",
    "gravitational potentials in the halos in our study are dominated by baryons at radii of less than a parsec and by dark matter at larger radii .",
    "we neglect the self - gravity of the remnant on scales below a parsec because of its large kinetic energy but include the potential of the dark matter on all scales .",
    "since merger times at @xmath0 20 are approximately 20 myr , much longer than the dynamical times of the remnant , to good approximation the gravitational potential of the dark matter can be held fixed in our simulations .",
    "we interpolate the dark matter potential of the halo onto the initial grid at the beginning of the run and onto each new grid thereafter , but the potential itself never evolves .",
    "we apply this potential to force updates to the gas velocities throughout the calculation .",
    "the interpolation substep is operator split from the time - dependent boundary updates of the fluid variables described above .",

    "yr these two structures merge into a new single chevalier phase with another reverse shock about to depart toward the origin .",
    "these crossing shocks form dense shells that rapidly recombine and become mostly neutral .",

    "they are the sites of the h ly @xmath103 losses from the remnant from 50 to 5000 yr in figure [ fig : losses]f that eventually amount to a third of the energy of the blast . in this period",
    "the kinetic energy of the remnant falls to 0.5% of the energy of the sn but at 5000 yr and 1.5 pc it still has sufficient momentum to expand .",
    "we show in figures [ fig:40ms_halo3_2]e - h the remnant at 2 myr and 7.93 myr . at 2 myr",
    "the remnant has devolved into a slow dense shell of warm neutral gas extending from 15 to 40 pc and surrounding a hot , ionized diffuse ( @xmath8 10@xmath6 cm@xmath17 ) interior .",
    "the inner surface of the shell soon falls back into the dark matter potential as shown at 7.93 myr in [ fig:40ms_halo3_2]e .",
    "the outer region of the shell ripples outward but at velocities well below that required for escape from the halo . by now",
    "the gas is fully neutral .    in contrast to blast models that fizzle when initialized by thermal energy in massive neutral halos @xcite , the free expansion in our model delivers enough impulse to the halo to seriously disrupt it out to 40 pc , even though the remnant retains less than 1% of the energy of the blast by 2 myr .",
    "although the baryons remain bound to the halo , the ejecta heavily enriches them with metals prior to fallback , radically altering their cooling and fragmentation timescales .",
    "we find that the baryons can rebound from the center more than once after their initial recollapse into the halo , with large , episodic infall rates onto the central black hole .",
    "this may constitute a mechanism for the rapid growth of supermassive black hole seeds at high redshift .",
    "the explosion and its metals remain completely confined to the halo , unable to enrich the early igm .    as another example of fallback in a trapped explosion , the evolution of the 15 @xmath4 supernova in halo 3 is qualitatively similar to that of the hypernovae , but with a few differences .",
    "first , the free expansion slows more quickly because it has less energy .",
    "the reverse shock at first fails to fully detach from the forward shock and instead forms a dense shell that emits extremely intense he lines . by approximately 1.1",
    "yr this radiation slows the forward shock , cooling it suddenly from 1 @xmath1 10@xmath100 to 10@xmath117 k in just 3.5 yr , extinguishing bremsstrahlung x - rays at 6 yr and terminating all other radiative losses by @xmath114 20 yr .",
    "afterwards , the blast loses kinetic energy only to adiabatic expansion and gravity .",
    "the remnant passes through a single chevalier phase at @xmath114 6000 yr , after which the reverse shock propagates back to the center of the halo .",
    "the reverse shock is too weak to ionize the interior , and the reverberations back to the forward shock are too faint to form shells .",
    "the sn therefore remains mostly neutral .",
    "gravity arrests its expansion at 2.5 pc at 1.35 @xmath1 10@xmath14 yr , and it falls back to the center of the halo .",
    "helium lines from the semi - detached reverse shock shell dominate the radiation from this remnant , emitting 75% of the energy of the blast .",
    "we show central infall rates associated with the fallback of the 15 and 40 @xmath4 remnants in halo 3 from 10@xmath9 yr to 2 @xmath1 10@xmath3 yr in figure [ fig : accr ] .",
    "infall occurs later in the more massive remnant because its greater explosion energy carries it farther from the center of the halo .",
    "there are three fallback phases in the 15 @xmath4 remnant over this time interval ranging from 10@xmath17 - 10@xmath12 @xmath4 yr@xmath13 in magnitude and from 1 - 2 myr in duration .",
    "the three episodes are punctuated by rebound from the core of the halo , which is not shown in the figure .",
    "the first infall phase of the 40 @xmath4 remnant manifests rates of 3.5 @xmath1 10@xmath12 @xmath4 yr@xmath13 and lasts 1.5 myr .",
    "these are not the only occurences of fallback ; our numerical models indicate several more will occur in less than a merger time .",
    "in addition to fueling rapid growth of a black hole , these episodes will thoroughly mix metals from the ejecta in the central regions of high density in the halo because the leading shocks are subject to dynamical instabilities during both rebound and collapse .",
    "however , we point out that fallback of the remnant to the center of the halo is distinct from accretion onto the black hole , whose rates are governed by angular momentum and radiation transport away from the central object .",
    "future radiation hydrodynamical simulations will determine the rates which the black hole grows in mass .",
    "intense bursts of x - rays from the central black hole will likely accompany these periods of heavy accretion , ionizing and heating gas within the halo and perhaps driving strong h@xmath5 formation .",
    "it is generally held that the broad i - fronts of black holes and quasars exert positive feedback on structure formation because h@xmath5 formation is promoted in their partially ionized outer layers ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , this picture is complicated by the fact that the accretion shock might radiate strongly in uv , including the lw bands , which would suppress h@xmath5 formation .",
    "furthermore , recent work on the structure of quasar ionization fronts indicates that they are preceded by a t - front , or temperature front @xcite .",
    "this is a layer of 10@xmath112 k minimally - ionized gas formed beyond the broadened i - front of black holes and quasars by the few most energetic photons .",
    "these photons cause secondary ionizations in the pre - front gas that heat it but can not sustain a large ionization fraction .",
    "the preheated gas might pre - empt h@xmath5 formation that would otherwise occur when the outer layers of the i - front reaches it .",
    "detailed numerical simulations will be required to resolve the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas in the vicinity of the seed black holes at the centers of large halos at high redshifts .",
    "the importance of including the dark matter gravitational potential in primordial sn models is particularly clear in trapped explosions .",
    "we performed experiments in which we set the halo in hydrostatic equilibrium and then evolved the blast without force updates by the dark matter potential . in these tests",
    ", the remnant simply continues expanding and there is no fallback .",
    "this provides a good check of the gravitational physics on the expanding grid and attests to the necessity of including dark matter in the calculation .",
    "we summarize the results of our explosion models in the left panel of figure [ fig : rs ] .",
    "halos less massive than 2.1 @xmath1 10@xmath9 @xmath4 are destroyed by population iii stars as small as 15 @xmath4 ( we reiterate that destruction of the halo refers to expulsion of its gas , not its dark matter ) . on the other hand ,",
    "pisn disperse much larger halos , even the first that could cool by atomic lines ( @xmath7 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) .",
    "this in part is because the star preionizes the halo . indeed ,",
    "even lower - mass primordial stars finally eject more than 90% of the baryons from halos @xmath8 10@xmath3 @xmath4 because their regions impart considerable momentum to the baryons prior to the explosion that facilitates breakout of the remnant into the igm .    in failed regions , enough momentum from even modest explosions , 10@xmath118 erg and 3 @xmath1 10@xmath119 erg , survives the enormous prompt radiative losses to disrupt halos out to a significant fraction of their virial radii .",
    "nevertheless , we find that type ii supernovae and hypernovae are contained by halos more massive than 1.0 @xmath1 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , but will destroy less massive halos that cool mainly by molecular hydrogen .",
    "recall that many primordial stars never explode : those lying between 50 and 100 @xmath4 and above 260 @xmath4 are not thought to exhibit any kind catastrophic mass loss @xcite . in these circumstances",
    "the halos are instead photoevaporated , with the loss of @xmath7 50% of the gas rather than 95% , as expected for a sn .",
    "although not all gas exits these halos , no subsequent star formation would follow for at least a merger time .      in the classic problem of a supernova blast in a uniform medium ,",
    "idealized remants evolve in four distinct phases : the free expansion , the sedov - taylor ( st ) phase , the pressure driven snowplow ( pds ) , and the momentum conserving snowplow ( mcs ) .",
    "each stage can be loosely associated with a power law for the position of the shock as a function of time : @xmath120 . in the early free expansion",
    "the flow is completely dominated by the momentum of each fluid element and this exponent is 1 .",
    "later , after the blast has swept up many times its own mass it consists of a self - similar adiabatic hot interior and non - radiative shock : the st phase @xcite in which @xmath121 .",
    "as the remnant grows , the shock begins to be driven by the pressure of its hot , now nearly isobaric interior in addition to its own momentum because the postshock fluid velocity approaches that of the shock @xcite . at about the same time , if the shocked gas can cool by radiation it collapses into a thin dense shell that accrues material as it snowplows the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "if the interior can not radiatively cool in this pressure - driven snowplow ( pds ) era",
    "its shock evolves according to @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "finally , if the interior loses energy both to @xmath101 work and radiation , the remnant becomes a momentum conserving snowplow ( mcs ) whose analytical solution yields @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the shell halts when it comes into pressure equilibrium with the ism , after which it disperses and becomes indistinguishable from its surroundings .",
    "we show in the right panel of figure [ fig : rs ] shock position as a function of time for all nine remnants .",
    "all clearly exhibit an @xmath124 expansion at early times but depart from the canonical stages of ideal remnants in uniform media thereafter .",
    "this is not surprising for several reasons .",
    "when the reverse shock breaks away from the contact discontinuity at the end of the free expansion , it reverberates back and forth across the interior , heating it and never allowing it to relax to an st phase , even though the leading shock does not radiate .",
    "this is likely why @xmath125 2/5 after the free expansion .",
    "when the remnant later mingles with the baryons that have been swept up into the region shock , it becomes strongly radiating without the formation of a thin shell .",
    "the curves taper somewhat more as the shock deaccelerates upon encountering the shell , as seen from 10@xmath117 to 10@xmath14 yr .",
    "the remnant can not be disentangled from the strong fossil ionized flows thereafter .",
    "on the other hand , supernovae in the dense cores of neutral halos depart from the standard behavior of ideal remnants in uniform densities because the cores are so stratified ( with baryon densities falling by @xmath126 ) , and because they radiate strongly from very early times . as a result",
    ", the free expansion ends in less than a year , and shocks reverberate through interior of the remnant even more frequently than in regions due to the inertia of the surrounding gas , again preventing the st phase from materializing .",
    "two stages of radiative loss without the formation of thin shells in the metal - free shocked gas then follow . through",
    "all three stages adiabatic expansion also slows the remnant , with eventual fallback into the halo .",
    "note that the plots in figure [ fig : rs ] trace the position of the leading velocity front in the gas , which can continue outward into the halo even if the bulk of the remnant , which does not have a precise location , falls back toward the center . in short , we find that primordial supernovae do not conform to the usual paradigm for ideal remnants in uniform media .",
    "note from these profiles that the shock experiences brief periods of acceleration in neutral halos and may therefore be susceptible to rayleigh - taylor instabilities in three dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the contact discontinuities separating forward and reverse shocks would also be prone to instabilities and breakup in multidimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "one trend that is immediately apparent in all nine remnants in figure [ fig : losses ] is that adiabatic expansion losses precede radiative losses in blasts evolving in regions but are coincident in neutral halos .",
    "another is that bremsstrahlung dominates energy losses in explosions in neutral halos but amounts to at most a few percent in regions .",
    "inverse compton scattering is greatest in the most powerful explosions in regions but virtually nonexistent in neutral halos , where the fireball cools before it can enclose large volumes of the cmb . in regions ,",
    "h ly-@xmath103 finally dominates radiative losses from primordial remnants , with singly - ionized he excitation next in importance .",
    "neutral he emission rivals or exceeds h ly-@xmath103 in less energetic blasts in neutral halos because he is not completely ionized .",
    "we plot luminosities due to excitation of h and he along with bremsstrahlung and ic for all nine remnants in figure [ fig : luminosities ] .",
    "type ii supernovae and hypernovae in regions emit three flashes of ly-@xmath103 lines : the prompt flash when the free expansion forms a shock with its surroundings , a second flash as the reverse shock breaks free of the forward shock and ionizes the interior , and a final flash when the remnant collides with the dense region shell .",
    "peak luminosities in the second and third flashes scale approximately with explosion yield : 10@xmath127 erg s@xmath13 for the type ii supernova and 10@xmath128 erg s@xmath13 for the hypernova and pisn .",
    "the third flash in more powerful explosions has twin peaks due to collisions with the smaller subsidiary shocks that lie just beyond the dense shell in the regions of more massive progenitors , as discussed in section [ sec : shells ] .",
    "the contributions to each flash by h and he@xmath25 are in proportion to their abundances . because he is always singly ionized at later times it is absent in the second and third flashes .",
    "the second flash is consistently two orders of magnitude less intense than the third flash because the mass of the remnant is much lower than that of the dense shell and remnant combined .",
    "it has been suggested that ly-@xmath103 photons from population iii stars are scattered by h in the early igm , coupling its spin temperature to its kinetic temperature without heating the gas @xcite .",
    "if the scattering region is not first heated by hard photons , the spin temperature would rapidly fall to the low kinetic temperature of the gas and the region would appear in absorption in 21 cm against the cmb .",
    "if more energetic photons later heat the scattering volume it would then appear in emission against the cmb , creating a brief absorption signal followed by a weak emission signal that is unique to population iii stars .",
    "our findings indicate that the same may be true of the supernova remnant but in reverse : x - rays from the collision of the remnant and the dense shell die out before the ly-@xmath103 pulse , resulting in a strong 21 cm absorption signal preceded by weak emission against the cmb .",
    "given that the lifetime of the main flash can exceed that of the star and that the scattering region can span several kpc proper , it may be possible to resolve them with the next generation of 21 cm observatories such as the _ square kilometer array _ ( _ ska _ ) .",
    "although the ly-@xmath103 intensity of the first flash is at least a hundred times greater than in the next two , the actual energy released is minute due to its transience and is of little importance to the evolution of the free expansion .",
    "the large fluxes are in part numerical ; they are emitted from the extremely large densities at the interface of the shock and the free expansion , which are not spatially resolved by the mesh .",
    "artificial viscosity smears the enormous jump in density there over several zones , over which the temperature rises from a few thousand to several billion k. in one of the zones the temperature crosses the threshold for h and he line emission , activating these cooling channels for the entire zone when in reality they originate from only an extremely thin shock layer that is a tiny fraction of the width of the zone .",
    "the ly-@xmath103 luminosity is thus overestimated by a factor roughly equal to the ratio of the widths of the zone and the shock ; it is probably several orders of magnitude lower than free - free emission for @xmath129 10 yr .",
    "little inaccuracy is introduced to the energetics of the ejecta by this artifact , not only because the energies involved are small .",
    "if excitational cooling of h and he are deactivated in this phase the shock simply remains hotter , with elevated free - free emission rates that are nearly identical to the total rates when excitational cooling is included .",
    "thus , nearly all the radiation in this era is really in x - rays , with peak luminosities of 10@xmath130 erg s@xmath13 . because the energy liberated is less than a millionth of the blast energy it does not appear in figure [ fig : losses ] .",
    "all three types of supernovae have similar luminosity profiles in regions in this era because the ejecta was assumed to have the same initial velocity profiles .",
    "note that the energy of the first pulse , which is from the interaction of the shock and ambient region , does not include the energy of radioactive decay in the ejecta , which is expected to be similar to that observed in sn today , @xmath7 10@xmath131 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "hypernovae and pisn in regions emit a second x - ray flash during the collision with the dense shell .",
    "in contrast to the prompt flash , the second burst is longer , @xmath7 10@xmath9 yr with luminosities of 10@xmath132 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "type ii supernovae emit only the second flash , with emission rates that are lower by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the durations of the second x - ray pulse and the inverse comptonization of the cmb are again in agreement with the free - free and ic cooling times of eqs [ eq : ff ] and [ eq : ic ] for densities of 0.1 cm@xmath17 and temperatures of 10@xmath3 k at 1 myr .",
    "although primordial supernovae were the first x - ray sources in the early universe they probably did not contribute to cosmological reionization @xcite .",
    "after examining early reionization by x - rays released by primeval supernovae , @xcite concluded that unrealistically large explosion rates are required to create significant x - ray backgrounds at high redshift .",
    "however , prompt x - rays from blasts completely contained within neutral halos , although not visible to external observers , may drive strong h@xmath5 formation that enhances the cooling and collapse of gas in the halos .",
    "as noted earlier , figures [ fig : losses ] and [ fig : luminosities ] show that cooling via inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons contributes strongly to the loss of kinetic energy in supernova remnants evolving in regions . in some cases , such as",
    "the one shown in figure [ fig : losses]g , it is more than 10% of the overall energy loss , but more generally only a few percent of the supernova s kinetic energy is deposited into the cmb . the strength of this cooling component is due to the high energy density of the cmb at the redshifts of these sn , and has been predicted by previous work @xcite .",
    "one result will be a distortion of the cmb due to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , predicted to be on the order of @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the angular size of a given hii region and supernova remnant at @xmath134 is quite small , however  on the order of 100 kpc ( comoving ) , which corresponds to an angular size of a few arc seconds .",
    "while individual pop iii supernovae would be essentially impossible to detect in the sz with current telescopes , clusters of supernovae would create spectra distortions with a power spectrum that can be predicted by making assumptions about clustering bias .",
    "we have examined the assumptions made by @xcite , and our results for radiative losses due to inverse compton scattering are generally much lower than their predictions of 30 - 100% of the supernova kinetic energy , suggesting that their results would be an upper bound on the contribution of population iii supernovae to the sz effect .",
    "indeed , recent work by @xcite suggests that the vast majority of population iii stars will form in halos with virial temperatures below @xmath135  k , with a contribution to the angular power spectrum somewhere between cases b and c of oh et al .",
    "( shown in figure 1 of their paper ) .",
    "this implies that contributions to the sz effect from population iii sn would be negligible in comparison to that from galaxy clusters , making them extremely difficult to detect .",

    "primordial supernovae can be more damaging to cosmological minihalos than previous studies suggest when they are properly initialized with kinetic rather than thermal energy .",

    "explosions in ionized halos evacuate gas from their virial radii to densities below 10@xmath6 @xmath96 .",
    "our models are in qualitative agreement with earlier one - dimensional lagrangian and three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) calculations of type ii and pair instability sn in primordial regions .",
    "our results are also consistent with early one - dimensional calculations of supernova blasts in uniform diffuse media @xcite : they too manifest reverse shocks that separate from forward shocks at relatively small radii and exhibit multiple shock reflections throughout the interior .    on the other hand , blasts in nearly neutral halos promptly radiate most of their kinetic energy as x - rays but retain sufficient momentum for the ejecta to reach radii of 10 - 20 pc .",
    "these contained explosions leave little observational footprint but radically alter the evolution of gas within the halo , first by contamination with heavy elements and then by successive cycles of fallback and rebound .",
    "this is a departure from earlier supernovae models in neutral halos initialized with thermal rather than kinetic energy that is radiated away before launching any flow out into the halo .",
    "again , in agreement with earlier work by @xcite and @xcite , we find that neither explosion pathway is well represented by the canonical phases of idealized remnants in uniform media ( sedov - taylor , pds , or mcs ) . in all cases inclusion of the dark matter potential",
    "is crucial ; models would otherwise fail to capture fallback in trapped explosions or erroneously predict expansion of the remnant until it achieves pressure equilibrium with the igm .",
    "primordial supernovae occurred in neutral halos only if the halo was @xmath10 10@xmath142 and the progenitor was not very massive .",
    "given that stars normally form by h@xmath5 cooling well before the halo reaches this mass , is it likely that such blasts ever happened ?",
    "the answer is yes if one considers halos at slightly later redshifts in rising lyman - werner backgrounds , whose effect is to postpone star formation in halos until they reach larger masses and become self - shielded to photodissociating photons @xcite .",
    "numerical surveys indicate that when stars form in more massive halos whose virial temperatures approach the threshold for atomic line cooling , they still do so by molecular hydrogen cooling and are subject to the range in masses examined in this paper @xcite .",
    "it is probable that explosions and fallback in more massive halos were more common at somewhat lower redshifts ( 15 - 20 ) than those of the very first stars .",
    "we also point out that there are a greater range of spin parameters for star - forming halos than are sampled in current studies .",
    "halos with higher angular momenta exhibit markedly lower central infall rates @xcite that lead to much less massive stars . finally ,",
    "since the processes that halt accretion onto primordial stars remains poorly understood , low - mass supernovae in relatively massive halos can not be ruled out .",
    "the recent discovery of the first potential pair instability supernova ever observed @xcite lends hope that this sort of explosion may have occurred in the high redshift universe .",

    "the ionization front of the progenitor itself would also be prone to violent dynamical instabilities in three dimensions due to h@xmath5 cooling , forming gas clumps in the relic region with which the blast would interact @xcite .",
    "they would be most prominent in regions trapped in massive halos , partly because d - type fronts better shield h@xmath5 from lyman - werner photons from the star and partly because r - type i - fronts that break free of halos would tend to photoevaporate any clumps that may have formed , although numerical simulations indicate that some would survive @xcite .",
    "i - front instabilities may also drive turbulence in the surrounding medium . both fragmentation and turbulence will enhance the mixing of metals in halos and should be included for self - consistency in future three dimensional models .",

    "explosions in ionized halos would sweep up h@xmath5 and hd that are rapidly forming in the relic region .",

    ", h@xmath5 might form in the forward shock as it partially recombines and cools to 10000 k , forming a dense shell that might be prone to breakup . in all likelihood , prior instabilities , such as rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the shock , would pre - empt those due to h@xmath5 cooling , but the radiative losses might still be relevant to the kinematics of the remnant .",
    "molecular hydrogen cooling might also be viable in trapped explosions .",
    "figures [ fig:40ms_halo3_2]b and f show that the leading shock in the contained blast recombines and cools at much earlier times , at about the same time instabilities would erupt in the contact discontinuity .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the reverse shock and vishniac instabilities in the forward shock mediated by h@xmath5 cooling could evolve together , destroying the shell from within and without .    in the absence of magnetic fields in the vicinity of the progenitor ,",
    "how would the free expansion interact with the region or neutral halo ?",
    "simple collisional cross section arguments imply that the ejecta particles would travel to great distances with little deflection by the surrounding gas unless magnetic fields mediate hydromagnetic interactions between the blast and its environment .",
    "if no primordial fields were present , the ejecta might interact differently with the halo than predicted by the fluid equations , which are predicated upon mean free paths in the flow being far shorter than characteristic lengths in the flow itself .",
    "nevertheless , for now it is reasonable to suppose that magnetic fields arise due to the weibel instability ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , effectively coupling the two plasma streams .",
    "this mechanism has been invoked to explain the origin of grb afterglows @xcite .",
    "an important phenomenon not noted in earlier surveys of primordial supernovae are the large central infall rates that can result from fallback when remnants fail to escape massive halos , in excess of 10@xmath12 @xmath4 yr@xmath13 and lasting 1 - 2 myr in some instances .",
    "such infall , although less coordinated , would certainly appear in three dimensional simulations and lead to rapid growth of the central black hole .",
    "the growth would be episodic since bounceback would periodically reverse the inflow , and three dimensional radiation hydrodynamical accretion simulations would be required to ascertain how much gas at the center of the halo would fall into the black hole . nevertheless , this mechanism may provide the means whereby black holes of several thousand solar masses could form in pregalactic structures at @xmath0 20 , which numerical studies suggest could be the origin of the supermassive black holes occupying the centers of most massive galaxies today @xcite .",
    "periodic accretion onto the black hole would emit bursts of radiation from the halo that might over time contribute to an x - ray background at high redshifts and strongly affect the thermal and chemical properties of the halo .",
    "one alternative to this scenario is that gas in the trapped explosion instead cools to tens of kelvin by metal - line cooling and then fragments , forming many low mass stars whose peculiar motions are confined to the dark matter potential of the halo .",
    "several tens of thousands of solar masses of gas could fuel low mass star formation in this manner .",
    "if large numbers of small stars can truly form in the halo the result could be a globular cluster 15 - 30 pc in diameter , the radii to which gas in the halo is disturbed by the blast .",
    "high dynamical range adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations are necessary to determine if gas in the halo can fracture and collapse in this fashion .",
    "finally , our supernova models may hint at an alternative pathway for the assembly of the first primitive galaxies .",
    "@xcite find that the first supernovae preferentially expel metals into the voids interspersed among cosmological filaments .",
    "since densities are relatively low there , the metals do not promote immediate star formation , and must generally await merger timescales to be taken up into a new generation of stars . if supernovae ejecta instead mix efficiently with the dense shells of relic h ii regions and cause them to cool and fragment , a second generation of stars with different chemical abundance patterns might promptly form . likewise , explosions trapped by massive halos could also create small populations of new stars before mergers with other halos .",
    "if so , the first primitive galaxies were assembled sooner , with more stars and different chemical abundances than in current cosmological models .",

    "<S> we present numerical simulations of primordial supernovae in cosmological minihalos at @xmath0 20 . we consider type ii supernovae , hypernovae , and pair instability supernovae ( pisn ) in halos from 6.9 @xmath1 10@xmath2 - 1.2 @xmath1 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , those in which population iii stars are expected to form via h@xmath5 cooling . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations are novel in that they are the first to follow the evolution of the blast from a free expansion on spatial scales of 10@xmath6 pc until its approach to pressure equilibrium in the relic region of the progenitor , @xmath7 1000 pc . </S>",
    "<S> our models include nine - species primordial chemistry together with all atomic h and he cooling processes , inverse compton cooling and free - free emission . </S>",
    "<S> the supernovae evolve along two evolutionary paths according to whether they explode in regions or neutral halos . </S>",
    "<S> those in regions first expand adiabatically and then radiate strongly upon collision with baryons ejected from the halo during its photoevaporation by the progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> explosions in neutral halos promptly emit most of their kinetic energy as x - rays , but retain enough momentum to seriously disrupt the halo . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the least energetic of the supernovae are capable of destroying halos @xmath8 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , while a single pisn can destroy even more massive halos . </S>",
    "<S> blasts in regions disperse heavy elements into the igm , but neutral halos confine the explosion and its metals . </S>",
    "<S> primordial supernova remnants develop dynamical instabilities at early times capable of enriching up to 10@xmath9 @xmath4 of baryons with metals to levels @xmath10 0.01 @xmath11 , well above that required for low - mass star formation . in regions , a prompt second generation of stars may form in the remnant at radii of 100 - 200 pc in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> explosions confined by large halos instead recollapse , with infall rates in excess of 10@xmath12 @xmath4 yr@xmath13 that heavily contaminate their interior . </S>",
    "<S> this fallback may either fuel massive black hole growth at very high redshifts or create the first globular cluster with a radius of 10 - 20 pc at the center of the halo . </S>",
    "<S> our findings allow the possibility that the first primitive galaxies formed sooner , with greater numbers of stars and distinct chemical abundance patterns , than in current models . </S>"
