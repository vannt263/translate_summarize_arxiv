    "in this talk i will deal with the problem of the resummation of logarithmically enhanced effects in the vicinity of the threshold region in hard hadroproduction processes .",
    "yan lepton pair production has been in the past the best studied example of this sort @xcite .",
    "the threshold region is reached when the invariant mass of the lepton pair approaches the total available energy . a large amount of theoretical and phenomenological work has been done on this subject .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite summarize all the theoretical progress performed in this field .",
    "resummation formulae have also been used in estimating heavy flavour production @xcite , @xcite . in this case",
    "only a leading logarithmic resummation formula is known .",
    "calculations of the next - to - leading logarithms are in progress @xcite .    here",
    "i will not deal with sophisticated higher order effects calculations .",
    "i will instead describe some recent progress @xcite in the understanding of how to implement the resummation .",
    "coloured particles emit soft gluons with high probability .",
    "normally the effect of soft gluon emission is small ( at least in inclusive quantities ) , since they only slightly affect the kinematic of a process .",
    "however , in a production process of high mass objects , when we approach the threshold , soft gluon emission becomes important .",
    "let us fix our attention on heavy flavour production in hadronic collisions near threshold . the process is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hvqprod ] .",
    "the incoming protons make a big effort in providing partons with a large fraction of the longitudinal momentum , thus going towards the very large @xmath0 region of the structure functions . under these circumstances ,",
    "even the small amount of energy wasted by soft gluon radiation yields an important suppression of the cross section . in the usual application of the factorization theorem , part of the radiative corrections due to gluon radiation are included in the structure functions .",
    "thus , depending upon the factorization scheme , the left - over suppression may be positive or negative . in the @xmath1  and dis scheme the left - over is negative , so that the suppression effect appears instead as an enhancement of the cross section .",
    "let us now focus upon the case of heavy flavour production .",
    "the perturbative expansion for the partonic cross section at order @xmath2 , neglecting obvious indices ( incoming parton types , etc . ) , has the structure ( ) = _ 0 ( ) , where @xmath3 is the square of the partonic centre - of - mass energy , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the born cross section _ 0()=f^(0 ) ( ) .",
    "the scale at which @xmath6 is evaluated is @xmath7 , unless the argument is explicitly given .",
    "the reader can find in ref .",
    "@xcite explicit formulae for the functions @xmath8 , as well as for the constant coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath9 depends upon the type of incoming partons ( i.e. quarks or gluons ) and upon the factorization scheme . in both the @xmath1  and the dis scheme it is positive , so that in the following we can think of it as being a positive constant .",
    "resummation , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , gives [ reslaenen ] ^(res ) ( ) = f^(0 ) ( ) where @xmath10 is a scheme - dependent function of @xmath3 that goes to zero as @xmath11 .",
    "we have @xmath12 , where @xmath13 in the dis scheme , and 3/2 in the @xmath1  scheme .",
    "formula ( [ reslaenen ] ) is supposed to include all terms of order @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "remember in fact that ( s^)= = = ( 1-(1-)+  ) . so that in the exponent there are terms with arbitrary powers of @xmath6 , and a power of the logarithm which is always larger than the power of @xmath6 .",
    "the first subleading terms have the form @xmath16 .    in order to get a physical cross section the partonic cross section given above should be convoluted with parton luminosities ^(res)= ( ) ^(res)(s)d=()f^(0 ) ( ) dwhere @xmath17 , and ( omitting obvious parton indices ) ( ) = f(x_1)f(x_2)(x_1 x_2-)dx_1 dx_2 . here",
    "we can spot a problem in the resummation formula . when performing our integral over @xmath18 , as @xmath19 the argument of @xmath6 in the exponential approaches zero .",
    "before it actually hits the zero , it will hit a singularity in the running coupling @xmath20 , causing the integral to diverge . in order to avoid the divergence",
    "a cutoff @xmath21 was introduced in the literature @xcite .",
    "observe that this cutoff has nothing to do with the standard factorization and renormalization scale @xmath22 .",
    "it is essentially a cutoff on soft gluon radiation , imposed in order to avoid the blowing up of the running coupling associated with soft gluon emission .",
    "the use of a cutoff seems an ad hoc procedure in this case .",
    "it can however be justified to some extent .",
    "suppose , for example , that we end up in a qcd calculation with a formula like [ example ] g=_0^q^2(k^2 ) g(k^2 ) dk where @xmath23 is a smooth function as @xmath24 .",
    "integrals of this kind are often found , for example , in the computation of shape variables in jet physics .",
    "this expression also is divergent as @xmath25 , since at some point @xmath6 approaches the landau pole .",
    "the divergence can be handled by a cutoff @xmath21 , which has to be large enough for @xmath6 to be barely perturbative .",
    "for example , we may choose @xmath26 , a value around 2 gev .",
    "we can then argue that g=__0^q^2(k^2 ) g(k^2 ) dk + c. in fact , the divergence of the 1-loop expression of @xmath6 does not signal a real physical divergence .",
    "more likely , the point at which @xmath6 becomes of order 1 signals the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "we therefore exclude this region , estimate its contribution by dimensional analysis , and obtain a power correction .",
    "a slightly more formal justification makes use of the concept of ir ( infrared ) renormalons .",
    "we expand eq .",
    "( [ example ] ) in powers of @xmath27 , using @xmath28 and we get @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the integral can be performed , and one gets @xmath31 which is a divergent series , since a factorial grows faster than any power .",
    "this lack of convergence is in fact a general feature of the perturbative expansion in field theory .",
    "the perturbative expansion should be interpred as an asymptotic one .",
    "the terms of the expansion ( [ divexp ] ) decrease for moderate values of @xmath32 .",
    "as @xmath32 grows the factorial takes over , the terms stop decreasing and begin to increase .",
    "this happens at the value of @xmath32 at which the next term is equal to the current one ( j+1)!(2b_0)^j+1=j!(2b_0)^j or roughly j_min=. asymptotic expansions are usually handled by summing their terms as long as they decrease .",
    "of course , in this resummation prescription there is an ambiguity , which is of the order of the size of the first neglected term . in our case",
    "j_min!(2b_0)^j_mine^jj - j = e^- , which gives a power - suppressed ambiguity with the same power law that we found using the cutoff procedure .    from the discussion given above",
    ", we would expect that the resummation formulae should include a cutoff of the order of a typical hadronic scale , and varying the cutoff within a factor of order 1 should affect the cross section by terms of the order @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , this is not the case .",
    "the cutoff has a dramatic effect on the cross section , as can be seen from figs .  2 and 3 of ref .",
    "for example , the uncertainty band obtained by varying the scale @xmath21 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for top production in the @xmath36 channel brings about a change in the cross section of a factor of 2 , for a top mass between 100 and 200  gev .",
    "these two values of @xmath21 correspond to cutting off the gluon radiation at energies of the order of 20 to 30 gev , therefore much larger than a typical hadronic scale .",
    "other proposals for the resummation procedure have appeared in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite a method was developed in the context of drell  yan pair production , and it was applied to the heavy flavour case in ref .",
    "@xcite . also in ref .",
    "@xcite ( as can be seen from formula ( 116 ) and the subsequent discussion ) unphysically large cutoffs are present , much larger than the typical hadronic scale that one expects .    in the following section",
    ", i will show that the presence of large cutoffs and of large ambiguities in the resummation formula , is not at all related to the blowing up of the coupling constant .",
    "in other words , there are other sources of factorial growth of the perturbative expansion for the resummation of soft gluons , and they largely dominate the factorial growth due to the running coupling .",
    "i will also show that these terms are spurious , and that soft gluon resummation can be easily formulated in such a way that these terms are not present .",
    "for definiteness , let us focus upon the resummation formula ( [ reslaenen ] ) .",
    "we pointed out earlier that this formula is divergent when the argument of @xmath6 becomes too small , and the coupling constant blows up .",
    "in fact , formula ( [ reslaenen ] ) is divergent even for fixed coupling constant . at fixed coupling",
    "it can be written as ^(res)&= & d()f^(0 ) ( ) + [ fixedcoupling ] & = & d_^1 ( /)f^(0 ) ( ) , where @xmath37 , and the integral diverges as @xmath38 , since the exponential ( a^2(1-))=(1-)^-a(1- ) grows faster than any inverse power of @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "this divergence can again be related to factorial growth in the perturbative expansion .",
    "expanding formula ( [ fixedcoupling ] ) in powers of @xmath6 we get ^(res)=_k=0^(c)^k _ ^1 d ( / ) f^(0)()^2k(1- ) .",
    "it is easy now to see that , due to its singularity for @xmath38 the integral of @xmath41 grows like @xmath42 .",
    "let us make here the simplifying assumption that @xmath43 . in a neighbour of the singularity ,",
    "the integral has the form _",
    "1-^1 d ^2k(1- ) = _",
    "1/^dt e^-t t^2k . where we have performed the substitution @xmath44 .",
    "the above integral equals _ 1/^dt e^-t t^2k = _ 0^dt e^-t",
    "t^2k-_0 ^ 1/ dt e^-t t^2k = ( 2k ) ! -_0 ^ 1/ dt e^-t t^2k .",
    "since _ 0 ^ 1/ dt e^-t t^2k < ( 1/)^2k+1 we see that the contribution to the integral near the singularity is dominated by the term @xmath42 .",
    "the power expansion for the cross section is then @xmath45 the above formula is in fact appropriate for the case of heavy flavour cross section with a lower cut on the invariant mass of the pair near threshold would have yielded an extra factor of 4/9 in front of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ factgr ] ) . ] . as in the previous example , the factorial growth of formula  ( [ factgr ] ) will give rise to ambiguitites in the resummation of the perturbative expansion .",
    "these ambiguities are not , however , related to renormalons , since they occur also at fixed coupling constant .",
    "in fact , they are in general fractional powers of @xmath33 , where @xmath46 is the scale involved in the problem , and @xmath47 is a typical hadronic scale . for example , in the case of heavy flavour production at fixed invariant mass of the heavy quark pair via the gluon - fusion mechanism , the ambiguity would have the form @xmath48 , and it would thus be extremely relevant even for very massive heavy flavour pairs .    these large terms in the perturbative expansion",
    "are in fact spurious .",
    "they are an artefact of the @xmath0 space resummation procedure .",
    "this can be easily understood with the following argument .",
    "exponentiation of the gluon emission is possible because , roughly speaking , each soft gluon is emitted independently .",
    "this independence is however only approximate : the total momentum must be conserved .",
    "momentum conservation , however , is a subleading effect in the soft resummation formula .",
    "yet , its violation leads to factorially growing terms .",
    "these terms are subleading from the point of view of the logarithmic behaviour , but very important from the point of view of the factorial growth of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the presence of large factorial terms due to momentum non - conservation can be understood also by simple arguments .",
    "the emission of @xmath49 gluons , where each gluon has a limit on its energy @xmath50 , leads to a phase space that is larger by a factor of @xmath51 than the case when the total energy of emission is bounded @xmath52 . thus phase space alone provides a @xmath51 factor .",
    "we can see in more detail the origin of the @xmath42 term by considering the formula for the partonic cross section with two emitted soft gluons , implementing momentum conservation .",
    "we have [ twosoft ] ^(2)()=(2c)^2 _ + _ + f^(0)(^)(-z_1 z_2^ ) dz_1 dz_2 d^. the leading logarithmic term of the above integral is given by ^(2)()=(2c)^2 ^4(1-)f^(0)()+  , where terms with less than 4 powers of logarithms are neglected .",
    "we now see that the integral of the leading logarithmic term of @xmath53 in @xmath54 has a large factor @xmath55 due to the integral of @xmath56 , while the integral of the full expression , eq .",
    "( [ twosoft ] ) , gives @xmath57_+\\right)^2 \\int_0 ^ 1 d{{\\hat{\\rho}}}^\\prime f^{(0)}({\\hat{\\rho}})\\;=0\\,,\\ ] ] due to the vanishing of the integrals of the soft emission factors with the @xmath58 prescription .",
    "in general , we see that if we take generic moments of @xmath59 ( i.e. @xmath60 ) , the leading log expression grows like @xmath42 , while the full expression grows only geometrically with @xmath49 .",
    "the criticism described so far applies to the calculations of soft gluon effects in heavy flavour production given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "as one may expect , the large factorial terms give rise to large corrections to the cross section .",
    "since the term of the perturbative expansion grow strongly with the order , they also give large uncertainties .",
    "@xcite , the presence of large uncertainties is in fact recognized . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the uncertainties are small .",
    "even there , however , an unphysically large cutoff is needed in order to make sense out of the resummation formulae .",
    "a second , more subtle criticism of the resummation formulae has to do with the presence of @xmath61 corrections that arise from infrared renormalons .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that soft gluon resummation does not yield the correct renormalon structure of the drell  yan cross section .",
    "this proof was given in a simplified framework in which the renormalon structure can be computed exactly .",
    "this result suggests the absence of @xmath61 corrections in drell  yan cross sections , an issue that is still much debated in the literature @xcite@xcite . we would like to remark , however , that even if @xmath61 corrections were present in drell  yan and heavy flavour production , they would only be of the order of 1% for top production at the tevatron .",
    "it is possible to formulate the resummation of soft gluons in such a way that the kinematic constraints are explicitly satisfied , and no factorial growth arises in the perturbative expansion .",
    "it is enough to formulate the resummation problem in the mellin transform space .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we specify a resummation prescription that uses the mellin space formula .",
    "we demonstrate that with such prescription there are no factorially growing terms in the resummed perturbative expansion . yet",
    ", this prescription consistently includes soft effects .",
    "we call this prescription `` minimal prescription '' ( mp from now on ) , because it does not introduce large terms that are not justified by the soft gluon approximation .",
    "we have computed various heavy flavour production cross sections using our mp formula .",
    "details are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "i report the most salient results .",
    "the importance of the resummation effects is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ bot - kfac ] , [ frtev ] and [ frlhc ] , where we plot the quantities [ deltadef ] , , . here",
    "@xmath62 is equal to our mp - resummed hadronic cross section in which the terms of order @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been subtracted , and @xmath65 is the full hadronic nlo cross section .",
    "the results for @xmath66 at the tevatron can be easily inferred from fig .",
    "[ bot - kfac ] , since the @xmath67 component is negligible at tevatron energies .    for top production",
    ", we see that in most configurations of practical interest , the contribution of resummation is very small , being of the order of 1% at the tevatron . a complete review of top quark production at the tevatron , based upon these findings ,",
    "has already been given in ref .",
    "we also observe that , for top production at the lhc , soft gluon resummation effects are negligible .",
    "of course , in this last case , there are other corrections , not included here , that may need to be considered .",
    "typically , since the values of @xmath0 involved are small in this configuration , one may have to worry about the resummation of small-@xmath0 logarithmic effects @xcite .",
    "we see from the figures that in most experimental configurations of interest these effects are fully negligible .",
    "one noticeable exception is @xmath66 production at herab , at @xmath68 , where we find a 12% increase in the cross section .",
    "this correction is however well below the uncertainty due to higher order radiative effects .",
    "for example , from the nlo calculation with the mrsa@xmath69 @xcite parton densities and @xmath70gev , we get @xmath71nb , a range obtained by varying the renormalization and factorization scales from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "thus the upper band is 80% higher than the central value , to be compared with a 10% increase from the resummation effects .",
    "this result is much less dramatic than the results of ref .",
    "the interest in the effects of resummation on the behaviour of jet cross sections at large energy is prompted by the discrepancy between the single - inclusive jet-  distribution at large , as measured by cdf @xcite , and the result of the nlo qcd predictions @xcite . for simplicity we will study the effects of soft gluon resummation on the invariant mass distribution of the jet pair , which is , from a theoretical point of view , very close to the drell  yan pair production .",
    "observe that other distributions , such as the @xmath74 of the jet , have a rather different structure from the point of view of soft gluon resummation .",
    "in fact , while the jet pair mass is only affected by the energy degradation due to initial state radiation , the @xmath74 of the jet may also be affected by the transverse momentum generated by initial state radiation , and by the broadening of the jet due to final state radiation .",
    "a study of the jet pair mass distribution is not of purely academic interest , since also for this variable an analogous discrepancy between data and theory has been observed @xcite .",
    "studies of resummation effects in the inclusive @xmath74 spectrum of jets are in progress ( m. greco and p. chiappetta , private communication ) .    in fig .",
    "[ jetcteq1 ] we show the following quantities : , , , where @xmath75 is equal to our mp resummed hadronic cross section in which the terms of order @xmath63 have been subtracted , and @xmath76 is the full hadronic lo cross section ( of order @xmath63 ) .",
    "we use as a reference renormalization and factorization scale for our results @xmath77 .",
    "notice that for large invariant masses the effects of higher orders are large .    to understand how much is due to the first order corrections ( which are exactly calculable @xcite ) and",
    "how much is due to corrections of order @xmath78 and higher , we show the following quantities in fig .",
    "[ jetcteq2 ] , , , , where @xmath79 is now equal to the mp resummed hadronic cross section with terms of order @xmath64 subtracted , and @xmath80 is an approximation to the full nl cross section , summed over all subprocesses , obtained by truncating the resummation formula at order @xmath64 .",
    "this figure shows that indeed most of the large @xmath81 factor is due to the pure nlo corrections , with the resummation of higher order soft gluon effects contributing only an additional 10% at dijet masses of the order of 1  tev .",
    "these results should only be taken as an indication of the order of magnitude of the correction , since we have not included here a study of the resummation effects on the determination of the parton densities . from this preliminary study",
    "it seems however unlikely that the full 3050% excess reported by cdf for jet s in the range 300450  gev could be explained by resummation effects in the hard process .",
    "it is possible that the remaining excess be due to the poor knowledge of the gluon parton densities at large @xmath0 , an idea pursued by the cteq group @xcite . #",
