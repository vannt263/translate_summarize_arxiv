    "the existence of dark matter , which constitutes around 26.8% of the total energy budget of the universe  @xcite , is currently supported by the galaxy rotation curve , gravitational lensing and large scale structure of the universe  @xcite .",
    "these evidences only indicate the gravitational interaction of dark matter .",
    "the detection of dark matter is yet a mystery .",
    "the only property of dark matter known to us is its relic abundance and is given by @xmath5  @xcite . within the framework of the standard model ( sm ) it is impossible to accomodate a particle candidate of dark matter .",
    "another aspect of sm is that it does not explain the non - zero neutrino mass which is confirmed by the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation observed in solar , atmospheric and reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "this indicates towards new physics operative beyond electroweak scale since the sm of particle physics can not explain the same without introducing any extra ingredients .",
    "it is found that seesaw mechanisms are the most elegant scenarios for generating small neutrino masses .",
    "one of them is the type - i seesaw ( or commonly refered as canonical seesaw @xcite ) which relies on the existence of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos . despite the sucess of seesaw mechanisms in explaining light neutrino masses , they suffer from direct testability at lhc or at any other near future accelerator experiments . on the other hand , one can lower the scale of new physics by generating neutrino masses through radiative mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the recently observed @xmath2 kev x - ray line signal in the spectrum of 73 galaxy clusters as reported by the xmm - newton x - ray observatory  @xcite will provide a strong hint for non - gravitational dark matter interaction if confirmed by others .",
    "a few attempts have been already taken in order to explain this excess of x - ray signal by ( i ) decaying dark matter or annihilating dark matter , @xcite , ( ii ) magnetic dipolar dark matter ( via upscattering of dark matter into an excited states and subsequent decay of excited states into dark matter and an x - ray photon ) , @xcite , ( iii ) others @xcite .",
    "from the recent explored scenarios it is found that such a photon signal , if the claimed excess persists , can be explained by late decay and/or annihilation of multi - kev mass dark matter , or decay of a second lightest metastable particle to lightest stable particle with a kev mass splitting . such a monochromatic photon signal can not be explained within the frame work of standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .    in this paper , we attempt to explain simultaneously the 3.5 kev x - ray line and non - zero light neutrino masses in a minimal extension of the sm while keeping the scale of new physics at the tev scales .",
    "we extend the sm with three right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath6 ) , one singlet charged scalar @xmath7 and an extra higgs doublet @xmath4 .",
    "we also impose a discrete symmetry @xmath8 which does not allow to mix the rh - neutrinos .",
    "a small mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is obtained by breaking the discrete symmetry softly . as a result a small mass splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "is created .",
    "this allows the next - to - lightest stable particle @xmath10 to decay to lightest stable particle @xmath9 through electromagnetic dipole moment operators .",
    "if the mass splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is about 3.5 kev , then the emittted photon can be identified with the observed x - ray line by xmm - newton x - ray observatory . since the lepton number is violated by the majorana mass of heavy rh neutrinos , the light neutrinos acquire their masses either at tree level or at loop level .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section - ii and section - iii",
    "we discuss in details a model of dipolar dark matter which not only give neutrino mass but also explain the 3.5 kev x - ray line . in section - iv",
    ", we discuss the relic abundance of dark matter .",
    "constraints from direct detection of dark matter is given in section - v .",
    "section - vi concludes .",
    "we augment the sm by introducing three right - handed fermions @xmath11 which are essentially singlets under @xmath12 .",
    "we also add a singlet charged scalar ( @xmath7 ) and a higgs doublet ( @xmath13 ) to achieve the proposed objective .",
    "the masses of all these new particles are assumed to be of @xmath14 .",
    "a @xmath15 symmetry is also imposed in order to keep the lightest of right handed neutrinos stable , which also serves as a candidate of dark matter .",

    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath21 and @xmath22 so that the decays @xmath23 and @xmath24 are kinematically forbidden . as a result @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are individually stable . however , under @xmath25 symmetry , @xmath26 goes to itself and hence it is not stable .",
    "it can decay through the process : @xmath27 .",
    "after electro - weak phase transition , the neutrino can acquire a small majorana mass through the type - i seesaw anchored by @xmath26 .",
    "notice that @xmath28 symmetry does nt allow @xmath9 and @xmath10 to mix with each other .",
    "we generate a small mixing between them by breaking @xmath28 softly with : @xmath29\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 has to be determined from the observed phenomenon . in particular , the breaking of @xmath28 symmetry allows a mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . as a result @xmath10",

    "the emitted photon can be identified with the recent observation of 3.5 kev x - ray line signal by the xmm - newton x - ray observatory .",
    "since @xmath4 is a scalar doublet under @xmath12 , it couples to @xmath32-boson and hence can modify the decay width of @xmath32-boson .",
    "therefore , we take the masses of @xmath4 particles to be larger than @xmath33 .",
    "that means @xmath34 the mass of the singlet chaged scalar @xmath35 is lower bounded by lep .",
    "it is given to be  @xcite @xmath36       and @xmath10 due to radiative correction through breaking of @xmath28 symmetry . ]    as mentioned before , the breaking of @xmath28 symmetry generates a mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the mixing can be calculated from fig .",

    "thus the mass splitting between the two eigenstates @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath43 if we assume that @xmath10 is heavier than @xmath9 , then the former can decay to latter by emitting a monochromatic photon with energy equal to the mass difference between them .",
    "moreover , the life time of @xmath10 should be larger than the age of the universe so that it can decay in the current epoch .",
    "if the mass difference between @xmath10 and @xmath9 is of @xmath1 kev , then the recent observation of x - ray line can be accommodated in this beyond sm scenario .",
    "let us first discuss the electromagnetic properties of heavy rh neutrinos @xmath44 with photon before deducing the potential implications of the magnetic dipole moment operator in radiative decay @xmath45 .",
    "due to the majorana nature , the diagonal magnetic moment of heavy majorana neutrinos is zero .",
    "there is only transition magnetic moment for them . the electromagnetic coupling for the heavy neutrinos with photon , via dimension - five effective magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) operator is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath48 is the transition magnetic moment between the first and second generation of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath10 , @xmath9 which can be calculated from fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) as        @xmath49    where @xmath50\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming @xmath51 and with a typical set of values : @xmath52 gev , @xmath53 , the loop factor is estimated to be @xmath54 .",
    "since we assume the mass splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is order of @xmath55 , the decay of @xmath10 to @xmath9 can give rise a monochromatic @xmath56-ray line .",
    "the decay rate of @xmath57 is estimated as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the energy of the emitted photon , which is nothing but the mass difference between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for the observed @xmath56-ray line we use @xmath60 and @xmath61 for decaying dark matter  @xcite .",
    "this implies that for @xmath62 gev , the decay rate is @xmath63 . in other words",
    "the life time of @xmath10 is @xmath64 , which is larger than the age of the universe . from eqn .",
    "( [ ndecay ] ) one can estimate the required magnetic moment is @xmath65 .      in order to fix the scale of new physics let us define the ratio : @xmath66[ratio - eqn ] in the above equation @xmath67 can be evaluated numerically .",
    "in particular , for a 350 gev dm mass , using @xmath68 and @xmath69 we get @xmath70 .",
    "thus the mass scale of the new particles are not far from the electroweak scale and hence can be searched at the collider . in particular ,",
    "the charged scalars @xmath3 and @xmath71 are important .",
    "these particles can be pair produced at lhc via the exchange of sm higgs particle . for example , @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath71 particles can also be detected through other decay processes , such as : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 are sm fermions .      through the electroweak ( ew ) phase transition ,",
    "one of the yukawa term @xmath76 generates a dirac mass term : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "but the @xmath26 has a majorana mass term @xmath80 which breaks lepton number by two units . as a result",

    "this is because of the exact @xmath28 symmetry in the lagrangian which prevents the yukawa terms @xmath85 and @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that @xmath87 prevents a vacuum expectation value for @xmath4 field , we can not generate a majorana mass of light neutrinos at the tree level through the coupling : @xmath88 .",
    "however , the latter can be generated through one loop radiative correction diagram as shown in fig.[fig : nu ] .        because of the quartic coupling : @xmath89 $ ] , the ew phase transition generates a mass square splitting : @xmath90 between the real ( @xmath91 ) and imaginary ( @xmath92 ) components of @xmath93 , the neutral component of @xmath4 field . as a result , the analytical expression for one loop - generated light neutrino mass is given by  @xcite : @xmath94\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] diagonalising the above radiative mass matrix we get only one of the state massive , say @xmath95 .",
    "since the origin of the masses of the two eigen states @xmath95 and @xmath84 are different they can easily satisfy the solar and atmospheric mass splitting constraint .",
    "the lightest stable particle ( lsp ) , which is odd under @xmath96 symmetry , is the @xmath9 and hence behaves as a candidate of dark matter .",
    "the next to lightest stable particle ( nlsp ) is the @xmath10 and is stable on the cosmological time scale .",
    "it decays to @xmath9 through the electromagnetic coupling as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "since the observed @xmath56-ray line implies that the effective electromagnetic coupling of @xmath9 and @xmath10 with photon is extremely small , the life time of @xmath10 is larger than the age of the universe .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 is also a candidate of dark matter .",
    "when @xmath10 decays its density gets converted to @xmath9 , while the net dm abundance remain intact .",
    "since the electromagnetic coupling between @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath97 is small , it can not bring the former two to thermal equilibrium .",
    "note that to bring @xmath9 and @xmath10 to thermal equilibrium through electromagnetic coupling one needs the magnetic dipole moment @xmath98  @xcite . hence the only way the right handed neutrinos",
    "are brought to thermal equilibrium is the interaction of @xmath9 with the singlet charged higgs ( @xmath7 ) and right - handed charged leptons ( @xmath99 ) and that of @xmath10 with the @xmath12 doublets @xmath100 and @xmath4 . for estimating the relic abundance of dm , the kev scale mass splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is irrelevant .",

    "( [ fig : omega_ratio ] ) we see that relic abundance increases with the rise of mass splitting between the dm and x - particles .",

    "we show the dependency of the observed relic abundance simultaneously on the mass of dm and the mass splitting between dm and x - particles for various couplings .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",

    "if the coupling increases then we need relatively large mass splitting so that the effective cross - section decreases to get the right relic abundance .",

    "therefore , we need a large mass splitting so that the effective cross - section decreases to give the correct relic abunance .     versus @xmath119 for different values of the couplings , i.e. , @xmath129 .",
