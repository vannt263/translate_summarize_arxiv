    "nevertheless , as we did not require a low energy approximation to a single dirac cone , we are not restricted to small values of the field amplitude .",

    "<S> importantly for our purposes , the previous studies on the honeycomb lattice were restricted either to full numerical calculations , very high frequencies and/or to a low energy approximation , thus constraining the value of the chern number to @xmath1 and leaving unknown the main part of the phase diagram .    in the present work , </S>",

    "<S> one can realize that while the chern number remains zero for the insulating phases , it becomes @xmath61 in the perturbed sm phases . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , our results also show that a change of the chern number can originate from two different mechanisms : the first mechanism corresponds to the usual haldane - like gap opening by trs breaking @xcite encoded into a mass term of opposite sign for the two dirac cones . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with previous studies working within the single dirac cone approximation and restricted to weak amplitudes of the driving @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from this mechanism that a change of the chirality of the field changes the sign of the mass term @xmath62 in eq.[chern ] , thus reversing the sign of the chern number . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the second mechanism corresponds to a change of chirality for each dirac cone ( first factor in eq.[chern ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this happens when either the intensity or the polarization of the field is continuously varied so that a pair of dirac cones is successively annihilated and created at two different points of the brillouin zone , thus reversing their vorticity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the field polarization does not fix by itself the value of the chern number . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the counterintuitive result that a clockwise driving field can give rise to a counter clockwise edge mode , or _ </S>",

    "<S> we show in the supplementary material the quasi - energy spectra for ribbons with different boundaries .    * _ multi - photon resonances and emergence of plateaus : _ * we now ask whether the driving can induce gapped phases with @xmath63 . one way to address </S>",
    "<S> this question is to notice that in order to obtain larger chern numbers , it is necessary to have more than one pair of dirac points @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies have shown that multi - photon resonances , occurring when the floquet bands overlap , can induce additional pairs of dirac points , provided that trs holds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an overlap can be achieved by decreasing the frequency , which brings the floquet side - bands closer to each other . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to investigate the effect of the frequency decrease on the topology of the system for drivings that break trs </S>",
    "<S> . however , a decrease in frequency increases the number of floquet bands involved in the description of the system , and as one approaches @xmath64 , the validity of @xmath65 breaks down . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics becomes highly non - linear , and a numerical treatment is required .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first describe how the system is affected when the side - bands overlap . in periodically driven systems , we must distinguish two inequivalent gaps : the one between the conduction and the valence bands _ within _ the same floquet side - band @xmath66 , and the one separating two _ different _ side - bands @xmath67 , as depicted in fig.[fig : schematic ] . note that in the high frequency limit , the @xmath67 gap was assumed to be infinite : this corresponds to the `` atomic '' limit between side - bands .    </S>",

    "<S> when neighboring side - bands touch due to a frequency decrease , the gap @xmath67 closes and a topological phase transition can happen .    </S>",

    "<S> there , two chiral edge states with opposite chirality to the pre - existing one in the gap @xmath66 have emerged along the same boundary . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the total chirality has changed sign whereas the field polarization has not . </S>",
    "<S> the system can therefore support chiral and anti - chiral edge states simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the quasi - energy shift of @xmath70 , makes the states in the gap @xmath67 different from the ones in the gap @xmath66 since they contain a time dependent correlation among the spinor components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to know whether two edge states with opposite chirality lie in the same gap or not . </S>",

    "<S> this is the second main result of this work . </S>",
    "<S> it shows a plateau structure with oscillations whose period decreases with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations are due to the coexistence of chiral and anti - chiral states , and reflect the dynamical topological phase transitions induced by the alternating closures and re - openings of the gaps @xmath68 as the frequency is tuned . </S>",

    "<S> the recent realization of a floquet micro - wave crystal exhibiting side - bands features @xcite , provides an additional promising direction for the achievement of the different regimes we describe here ( the hopping parameter being of the order of a few mhz @xcite whereas the driving frequency of the cavity can vary up to the ghz @xcite ) . in graphene , the possibility to induce phases with higher chern numbers would correspond to electromagnetic frequencies @xmath86 above the thz , from the mid infrared to visible light . </S>",
