    "the gravitational wave ( gw ) era started with an overwhelmingly strong and convincing event ( called gw150914 ) , reported to originate from an unexpected source of a massive black hole binary merger @xcite .",
    "neither were merger rates of such massive binaries well established ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for optimistic rates ) , nor is it clear whether or not one should expect an electromagnetic signal @xcite .",
    "finding the electromagnetic counterpart is the next challenge which is difficult also because of the large error circles of the present gw detection capability @xcite .    with the all - sky gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard the fermi satellite",
    "a flaring event with a signal - to - noise ratio of 5.1 and a false alarm probability of 0.22.8% ( depending on the assumed likelihodd distribution over the search window ) was reported @xcite .",
    "if true , and indeed related to the gw event , this would be a fascinating discovery , allowing truly astrophysical constraints on the massive black hole binary merger . in view of this importance of correlated electromagnetic signals to gravitational wave events",
    ", particular scrutiny is required in the evaluation of candidate electromagnetic signals . here , we report some additional analysis of the fermi / gbm data .",
    "we approach our analysis in two steps .",
    "first , we examine methodology implemented in the standard gbm analysis tools and improve upon it paying special attention to the statistical nature of the data in light of the fact that the alleged source is weak and background dominated ( fig . [",
    "fig : countspec ] , sect .",
    "next , we repeat the spectral analysis following the approach of @xcite using the standard tools for gbm analysis as well as examine the surrounding temporal background spectrum ( sect .",
    "3 ) . finally , we implement a more statistically advanced approach to the spectral analysis which leads us to the conclusion that the source spectrum is more consistent with the background , rather than a short - hard grb ( sect .",
    "4 ) . after demonstrating consistency with the integral / acs non - detection ( sect .",
    "5 ) , we conclude that caution should be taken with interpreting the gbm event as an astrophysical source",
    ".    1 mev ) channel omitted .",
    "the highest - count channel is the one at 50100 kev with 13 counts , demonstrating the low - count regime of the spectrum .",
    "the purple dashed line indicates the level at which the @xmath0 background fitting method breaks down .",
    "the blue and green error bars show the @xcite confidence intervals .",
    "[ fig : countspec],width=423 ]",
    "the gbm is a non - imaging instrument relying on temporal isolation of signal against background . in practice",
    ", an observer identifies a source time interval in the light curve by its transient nature , compared to the smoothly - varying behavior of the background .",
    "sophisticated algorithms may be applied to identify this source time interval , i.e. , bayesian blocks @xcite , signal - to - noise threshold , etc .",
    "regardless , once a source time interval is identified , the background must be modeled so that it can be properly accounted for in spectral fitting of the source interval .",
    "therefore , gbm spectral analysis consists of a two - step process , temporal fitting of the background lightcurve and subsequent fitting of the source spectra .",
    "we will detail both processes in the following two sub - sections .    as a starting note",
    ", we recall that the event reported by @xcite was not identified by any of the standard undirected offline gbm search procedures , due to its faintness . instead",
    ", it was identified by a targeted search , seeded with the time of the gw event @xcite .",
    "indeed , the count distribution of the event is fully consistent with the noise distribution before and after the event .",
    "two numbers given in @xcite are particularly worth noting : + ( i ) one is the signal - to - noise ratio snr = 5.1 ( corresponding to a significance of @xmath1 ) as given in their fig .",
    "this estimate is not determined purely on raw counts , but uses a spectral model ( chosen to be a band function with a low - energy power law of spectral slope 0 for the energy range where most counts are detected ) to create , for a given sky location , a model rate per energy channel which then is used to weight the raw counts of the different detectors for the summing towards a `` signal - to - noise optimized light curve '' @xcite .",
    "while this hard spectral model best matched the observed counts in the gbm detectors @xcite , we show below that a more appropriate spectrum has a spectral index of @xmath2 , thus lowering the snr .",
    "+ ( ii ) the other important number is the false alarm probability of 0.2% @xcite which corresponds to 2.9@xmath3 , which is calculated from the measured false alarm rate of spectrally hard events in 2.5 days of gbm data , while that of spectrally soft events is larger ( see fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "due to this reason , the given false alarm probability of 0.2% is an optimistic lower limit .     as a function of the true rate for both the poisson and @xmath0 background fitting methods .",
    "while the modification of @xmath0 made in rmfit ( weighted @xmath0 ) improves the results , it still a poor statistic at very low - counts which frequently occur in high - energy channels .",
    "+ [ fig : bkg2],width=385 ]      due to the nature of gbm backgrounds , it is difficult to define a spectral background model .",
    "the background contains a superposition of astrophysical , terrestrial , solar , and instrumental sources , each with its own time variability .",
    "therefore , an assumption is made that in each gbm energy channel , the background is smoothly varying with time . with this assumption",
    "one selects a time interval before and after the source time interval and fits a polynomial in time to the count evolution to these time intervals but excluding the source time interval .",
    "this polynomial is then interpolated through the source time interval to estimate the background counts in each energy channel during the time of source activity .",
    "a major assumption of this approach is that the background does not vary during the source time interval more than the smooth nature apparent in the surrounding background time interval .",
    "this assumption is most likely valid if the source time interval is short compared to the time scale of the variations of the fitting polynomial .    to determine the polynomial shape of the temporal background count evolution , a fit to statistically fluctuating data must be performed . under the assumption that these counts should be poisson distributed",
    ", the statistic to choose for maximum - likelihood estimation ( mle ) is the poisson likelihood ( e.g. the so - called cash statistic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the model and detected counts in the @xmath7 of @xmath8 bins , respectively . taking the @xmath9 and approximating the factorial term with stirling s approximation @xcite distribution under the condition that the fisher information matrix is positive definite , i.e.",
    ", the model is linear in its parameters @xcite .",
    "often , the terms dependent only on the data are dropped as they do not affect minimization @xcite . ]",
    ", we have : @xmath10    the polynomial coefficients can be estimated via minimizing the log - likelihood of the background data and the polynomial integrated over each time bin .    in the rmfit software ,",
    "generally used for gbm grb data , the approach for determining the background is similar to the above method , except a weighted least - squares ( @xmath0 ) statistic is chosen to fit the polynomial coefficients via a two - pass method .",
    "first , the polynomial coefficients are estimated by solving the least - squares linear equations assuming that the data variance is equal to the number of counts .",
    "then , the fit is performed again , but using the variance of the model determined in the first pass .",
    "this is intended to compensate for the fact that at low counts , the gaussian approximation of the poisson distribution is poor .    in the high - count regime",
    ", this approach may be valid .",
    "however , due to the fact that a polynomial is fit in each energy channel and that the background has fewer counts at high energies , the @xmath0 statistic can be very biased @xcite . to estimate this effect , we simulate synthetic light curves obeying a zero - order polynomial evolution in time over a period of 20 seconds .",
    "we choose a set of levels for the background mean rate ( @xmath11 ) ranging from 1 - 100 cts s@xmath12 .",
    "for each @xmath11 , we simulate 500 lightcurves , and fit a polynomial to them with two different statistics criteria : cash , and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the cash statistic well recovers the true @xmath11 even at very low counts , while both @xmath0 methods have a large bias at low counts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bkg2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we will use the poisson likelihood to fit the background in our spectral analysis , but will compare the results to what is found using rmfit and @xmath0 .      in the low source count regime , the choice of spectral fitting statistic is crucial .",
    "the total count rate in a source interval is distributed as a poisson process , but we have more information via the background fit to better constrain the spectral fit parameters .",
    "the total counts in a spectral bin ( @xmath6 ) , is composed of source and background ( @xmath13 ) . since we have estimated the background via a polynomial model , we can include this information in the poisson likelihood .",
    "let @xmath14 be the estimated polynomial background rate model in a given energy channel where @xmath15 is time and @xmath16 are the polynomial coefficients .",
    "then , for a given source interval from time @xmath17 to @xmath18 , we have @xmath19    now , @xmath16 are fitted coefficients with associated statistical errors and therefore @xmath13 also has statistical error ( @xmath20 ) . using the covariance matrix for @xmath16 , we can estimate @xmath20 via standard gaussian error propagation ( see * ? ? ? * for a review of standard gaussian error propagation ) .",
    "error propagation assuming that the resulting error distribution is gaussian leads to gaussian uncertainties on the model estimated @xmath13 quite naturally .",
    "we must use a likelihood for poisson data with a gaussian background to fit the spectral data .",
    "this is embodied in the pg - statistic @xcite : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the source interval duration and @xmath23 is the profiled - out background model .",
    "this is the statistic we will minimize in our spectral analysis .    in the rmfit software ,",
    "the background is assumed to be perfect with no variance .",
    "therefore , only the total counts are assumed to have statistical variability . to deal with this",
    ", rmfit modifies the poisson likelihood by adding the estimated background from equation [ eq:3 ] to the estimated spectral model counts :    @xmath24      since it is possible that the method of @xcite recovers a significant fluctuation above the typical background , it is important to understand if the source has the spectral parameters reported in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we simulate the problem .",
    "we fit the background of the data before the trigger over a duration of 10 s to obtain the average background rate in each channel .",
    "we then simulate 10 s background from this sampled spectrum assuming each channel has poisson fluctuations with their means derived from the sampled spectrum .",
    "next , we simulate a one second source with a power law spectrum .",
    "we choose the power law index to be 1.4 and three different amplitudes : a=@xmath25 .",
    "the first amplitude models the claim of @xcite , the second simulates an order of magnitude weaker source , and finally the last amplitude implies no source .",
    "for each set of spectral parameters , we generate 100 sets of source and background simulations and create tte data via the method described in @xcite .    for each simulation , we fit the simulated source spectra with three different methods .",
    "first , we fit the background and spectrum in rmfit .",
    "next , we use the poisson method to fit the background , and fit the source spectra with the standard pgstat statistic . to minimize the likelihood , we use minuit and our own rsp matrix convolution software for computational simplicity ( hereafter mlefit ) , but verified our results by producing pha files for source and background and fitting them with xspec .",
    "we effectively compare three different methods for fitting spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : amp1 ] shows the results of the simulations where we assume the same source spectrum reported in @xcite .",
    "mlefit using pgstat recovers the true simulated amplitude more accurately than any other method .",
    "the same has been shown to be true for a simulation of different spectral slopes at identical amplitudes ( see fig . 7.3 . in * ? ? ?",
    "rmfit is biased to slightly higher amplitude values .",
    "when the source amplitude is reduced by an order of magnitude , mlefit is about to find the correct amplitude with either statistic though the modified c - stat is slightly biased towards higher values . on the other hand",
    ", rmfit recovers a source amplitude resembling what is found in @xcite ( see figure [ fig : amp1 ] ) .",
    "similarly , when there is no source , mlefit finds a source amplitude near zero , while rmfit still finds a source amplitude of @xmath26 .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "mlefit is able to distinguish between source and background while rmfit is including background in its source spectrum .",
    "the fact that rmfit finds a source spectrum similar to what is reported in @xcite even when there is _ no source _ indicates that the background spectrum can be modeled with a power law having an amplitude and overall spectrum very similar to the reported source spectrum in @xcite .",
    "we further demonstrate this in the following section .    combining the low count bias of @xmath0 which can underestimate the background level and the assumption of no variance on this underestimated background via the use of rmfit s modified c - stat , it is possible to find a source spectrum and flux that is unrealistically too large as we will demonstrate using our approach to spectral fitting .",
    "following @xcite , we generate 10 sets of detector response matrices ( rsps ) corresponding to the 10 locations listed in the same work , using the standard stand - alone response generator .",
    "we use the gbm team created software , rmfit to bin the data , make energy selections equivalent with those in @xcite , as well as fit the background to the surrounding count light curve .",
    "we fit a power - law spectrum to the data , using the 10 different rsps discussed above .",
    "table [ tab : fit ] details these fits . within the statistical errors , these are compatible with the spectra derived by @xcite , in particular the details given in their sect .",

    "the event seen by gbm at 0.4 s after the gravitational wave gw150914 is a very faint , sub - threshold event @xcite , not found by any of the standard undirected algorithms designed to pick up untriggered events . both , the signal - to - noise ratio as well as the false alarm rate reported in @xcite depend on the assumed hard spectral shape  a softer spectral shape increases the probability of a background fluctuation .    based on this and our analysis",
    "we conclude that the event @xcite seen in gbm 0.4 sec after the gravitational wave event gw150914 @xcite is very likely not an astrophysical event due to three reasons : ( i ) the spectrum is soft , and softer than typical short - hard grbs , ( ii ) the spectrum is consistent with the background spectrum as measured by gbm , ( iii ) due to our more thorough background treatment , the fluence of the event is substantially fainter , consistent with zero .",
    "combined with the softer slope our spectral deconvolution predicts that integral - spi / acs should not detect this event , consistent with reality @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is more consistent with the expectation of no @xmath72-ray emission from binary black hole mergers @xcite , and requires no effort in significant fine - tuning of models to explain the alleged delay of the gamma - ray emission relative to the gravitational wave emission .",
    "we have further identified issues with the standard gbm fitting tool , rmfit , in the low - count regime and advocate for careful study of the statistics when handling the spectra of marginal detections .",
    "we emphasize that rmfit can be safely used for events in the high - count regime , as has been done in many previous fermi / gbm publications . in the low - count regime ,",
    "the pgstat statistics or our bayesian method properly model the statistical properties of gbm data , and our simulations show that in this case , our results are more accurate than the statistical tools in rmfit .",
    "this has been verified by ( i ) comparing predictions for integral / acs detectability against its actual performance for short grbs , as well as ( ii ) by recognizing faint short grbs detected by gbm ( and confirmed by integral / acs detections ) with even smaller significance in the broad - band gbm light curve as the gbm - gw150914 event .",
