    "in this paper we compare predictions for moderate @xmath14 gev/_c _ observables in @xmath0 reactions at 4.4@xmath1 tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , that will help to discriminate between models of initial conditions assumed in pb+pb collisions at 2.76@xmath1 tev .",
    "the possibility that the first data on @xmath0 may be taken soon , with a potential high physics payoff motivates this paper .",
    "all models details are extensively discussed in the literature and we focus only on the updated nuclear modification factor , @xmath15 , predictions testable with a short 4.4@xmath1 tev run . in minimum bias ( mb ) and",
    "central ( @xmath16 ) @xmath0 collisions the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath17 ) interactions ( with an inelastic cross section @xmath18 mb ) is @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "this control experiment has long been anticipated to play a decisive role in helping to deconvolute initial and final state interaction effects in pb+pb reactions at the lhc .",
    "the @xmath21 control experiment at 0.2@xmath1 tev played a similar critical role for au+au at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the importance of @xmath0 was also emphasized in the 2007 last call for lhc compilation of predictions  @xcite and many other works  @xcite .",
    "the open problem after the first very successful lhc heavy ion run in 2010 @xcite remains how to deconvolute nuclear modification effects due to initial state and final state effects . without a clear calibration of the magnitude of initial state suppression of the incident nuclear partonic flux",
    "it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase of matter produced at the lhc . at rhic",
    "the same problem was resolved at mid - rapidity by the observation of no appreciable nuclear modification in @xmath21 control experiments in 2003  @xcite ( see also figure  [ fig : fig3 ] below ) .",
    "an approximately factor of four suppression of moderate @xmath6 mid - rapidity pions observed in au+au at rhic could then be interpreted as due to final state jet energy loss in a high opacity qgp produced in central au+au collisions at rhic .    at the lhc",
    "the initial flux is much more uncertain than at rhic because of the higher density of partons at an order of magnitude smaller fractional momenta @xmath22 . at high initial densities",
    "all models predict a breakdown of additivity of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdf ) .",
    "the magnitude of the breakdown however varies greatly in the literature in both collinear factorized approaches and @xmath23 factorized parton saturation model approaches  @xcite .",
    "therefore , even a rough first experimental constraint from @xmath24 interactions would have high impact on the development of nuclear collision modeling .",
    "nuclear shadowing of quark and gluon npdfs at large @xmath25 and moderate @xmath4 is well constrained from @xmath3 and lower energy @xmath13 data .",
    "global fit parametrizations of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdf ) are available  @xcite .",
    "dglap evolution @xcite to higher @xmath4 predicts a rapid reduction of shadowing effects and therefore only modest modifications of @xmath26 for @xmath27 gev / c have been predicted  @xcite .",
    "as emphasized in  @xcite , any observed significant modification from unity would be inconsistent with most current npdfs and therefore pose a severe challenge to conventional collinear factorized qcd approximation to high-@xmath6 processes not only in @xmath0 but even more so in pb+pb collisions .",
    "we continue here to investigate this central thesis .    at rhic",
    "there is clear evidence at high rapidities , where small fractional parton momenta @xmath28 similar to central @xmath0 are probed , that binary collision scaling of collinear factorization breaks down .",
    "color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xmath23 factorization models have been developed to explain these deviations  @xcite and nearly identical @xmath29 nuclear modifications factors were predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( kkt04 ) for forward rapidities at rhic and mid - rapidity at the lhc .",
    "however , collinear factorized approaches with dglap evolved npdf appear to provide an alternate explanation of forward single inclusive yields at rhic  @xcite . at lhc energies we can differentiate between these explanations because the collinear factorized approach predicts only small nuclear modification for mid - rapidity pions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] below ) , while at rhic energies it predicts large modifications , as cgc does , for forward produced pions .",
    "the much higher energy range at the lhc also opens the kinematic window on small @xmath30 physics that can be explored in @xmath13 collisions at mid - rapidity .",
    "some cgc models  @xcite predict a suppression with @xmath31 with strong dependence on the initial evolution conditions .",
    "such small values of @xmath32 would imply that nearly all nuclear suppression observed in nmf @xmath33 in pb+pb collisions , previously attributed to jet quenching in the final state , could instead be due to nonlinear initial state parton flux suppression .",
    "due to a factor of two increase in the final parton densities at the lhc , jet quenching is expected to produce higher suppression than at rhic energies . actually , the observed pb+pb suppression of pions at the lhc energy was surprisingly weaker than expected from rhic constrained analysis extrapolated to the lhc  @xcite .",
    "thus , from the perturbative final state interaction point of view there appears to be no room for initial state suppression .",
    "therefore , a measurement of @xmath32 at mid - rapidity significantly less than unity would contradict not only perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) models of the initial state npdf evolution but also theory of the final state perturbative opacity series of jet energy loss .",
    "since strong coupling ads / cft holography @xcite predicts even stronger final state suppression effects , an observation in @xmath0 of significant deviations from unity would then call into question the validity of holographic interpretations of rhic and lhc @xmath34 results , including the applicability of minimal viscous hydrodynamics to apparent perfect fluidity .    at sufficiently high energies and virtualities ,",
    "qcd factorization theorems guarantee that jet observables can be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "the open question is at what scale does factorization break down for nuclear processes .",
    "cgc theory @xcite has a saturation natural scale @xmath35 that in principle provides the answer when @xmath36 .",
    "however , nuclear jet observables up to lhc energies are sensitive to details of large @xmath37 as well as small @xmath38 `` corona '' nucleon distributions for which @xmath39 gev .",
    "monte carlo models as hijing1.0  @xcite , hijing2.0  @xcite and hijing / bb2.0  @xcite have been developed to study hadron productions in @xmath40 , @xmath13 and @xmath34 collisions .",
    "they are essentially two - component models , which describe the production of hard parton jets and the soft interaction between nucleon remnants .",
    "the hard jets production is calculated employing collinear factorized multiple minijet within pqcd .",
    "a cut - off scale @xmath41 in the transverse momentum of the final jet production has to be introduced below which ( @xmath42 ) the interaction is considered nonperturbative and is characterized by a finite soft parton cross section @xmath43 .",
    "jet cross section , depend on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) that are parametrized from a global fit to data  @xcite .",
    "nucleons remnants interact via soft gluon exchanges described by the string models @xcite and constrained from lower energy @xmath44 data .",
    "the produced hard jet pairs and the two excited remnants are treated as independent strings , which fragments to resonances that decay to final hadrons .",
    "longitudinal beam jet string fragmentations strongly depend on the values used for string tensions that control quark - anti - quark ( @xmath45 ) and diquark - anti - diquark ( @xmath46 ) pair creation rates and strangeness suppression factors ( @xmath47 ) . in the hijing1.0 and hijing2.0 models a constant ( vacuum value ) for the effective value of string tension is used , @xmath48 gev / fm . at high initial energy density",
    "the novel nuclear physics is due to the possibility of multiple longitudinal flux tube overlapping leading to strong longitudinal color field ( scf ) effects .",
    "strong color field ( scf ) effects are modeled in hijing / bb2.0 by varying the effective string tensions value .",
    "scf also modify the fragmentation processes resulting in an increase of ( strange)baryons which play an important role in the description of the baryon / meson anomaly . in order to describe @xmath40 and central pb + pb collisions data at the lhc",
    "we have shown that an energy and mass dependence of the mean value of the string tension should be taken into account @xcite . moreover , to better describe the baryon / meson anomaly seen in data a specific implementation of jj loops , has to be introduced . for a detailed discussion",
    "see ref .",
    "similar result can be obtained by including extra diquark - antidiquark pair production channels from strong coherent fields formed in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "all hijing type models implement nuclear effects such as nuclear modification of the partons distribution functions , i.e. , _ shadowing _ and _ jet quenching _ via a medium induced parton splitting process ( collisional energy loss is neglected )  @xcite . in the hijing1.0 and hijing / bb2.0 models duke - owen ( do ) parametrization of pdfs @xcite",

    "one assume that the parton distributions per nucleon in a nucleus ( with atomic number a and charge number z ) , @xmath55 , are factorizable into parton distributions in a nucleon ( @xmath56 ) and the parton(a ) shadowing factor ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 the impact parameter dependence is implemented through the parameter @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the nuclear radius .    in hijing / bb2.0 the shadowing factor for gluon and quark",

    "<S> @xmath4 used in @xmath3 global fit , our results confirm that no significant initial state suppression is expected ( @xmath5 ) in the @xmath6 range 5 to 20 gev/_c_. in contrast , the fixed @xmath4 shadowing models assumed in hijing type models predict in the above @xmath6 range a sizable suppression , @xmath7 at mid - pseudorapidity that is similar to the color glass condensate ( cgc ) model predictions . </S>",
    "<S> for central ( @xmath8 ) @xmath0 collisions and at forward pseudorapidity ( @xmath9 ) the hijing type models predict smaller values of nuclear modification factors ( @xmath10 ) than in minimum bias events at mid - pseudorapidity ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
