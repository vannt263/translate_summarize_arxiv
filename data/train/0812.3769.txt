    "high - mass stars are major producers of ultraviolet light and byproducts of thermonuclear fusion , so are important objects in the study of star formation , and galactic chemical and kinetic evolution ( e.g.  samland 1998 ) .",
    "the large luminosities of high - mass stars means that they are important distance indicators in both a galactic and cosmological context ( e.g.  guinan et al.1998 ; ribas et al .",
    "2005 ; southworth et al .  2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "in the last decade new theoretical models have been constructed which incorporate a number of physical processes important to the structure and evolution of high - mass stars , including convective core overshooting , semiconvection , rotational mixing and mass loss .",
    "overshooting and rotation can both have a large effect on the predicted lifetimes and luminosities of high - mass stars ( c.f .",
    "review by maeder & meynet 2000 ) .",
    "however , empirical constraints on these processes remain hard to come by , despite a steady improvement in observational techniques and capabilities ( see hilditch 2004 ) .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) are vital objects for obtaining observational constraints on the structure and evolution of high - mass stars , since they are the primary source of directly measured stellar properties ( andersen 1991 ) . unfortunately , accurate ( 2% or better ) physical properties are available for only eight high - mass debsjkt ] , and most of these objects have no observational constraints on their chemical composition .",
    "chemical abundances are difficult to determine from the spectra of high - mass debs for several reasons .",
    "firstly , they tend to display only a small number of spectral lines .",
    "secondly , the often high rotational velocities of these objects means their spectral lines are wide and shallow so high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra are needed to obtain useful results .",
    "thirdly , in debs the spectral lines from one component interfere with the line profiles of the other component ( ` line blending ' ) .    in a seminal work ,",
    "simon & sturm ( 1994 ) introduced the technique of _ spectral disentangling _ ( spd ) , by which _ individual _ spectra of the component stars of a double - lined spectroscopic binary system can be deduced from a set of composite spectra observed over a range of orbital phases .",
    "spd can be used to measure spectroscopic orbits which are not affected by the line blending which afflicts other methods , such as cross - correlation ( see southworth & clausen 2007 ) .",
    "the resulting disentangled spectra also have a much higher s / n than the original observations , making them very useful for chemical abundance analyses . as a bonus ,",
    "the strong degeneracy between effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath3 ) is not a problem for debs because surface gravities can be measured to high accuracy ( 0.01dex or better ) for both components .",
    "a detailed study of these possibilities is given by pavlovski & hensberge ( 2005 ; hereafter ph05 ) .",
    "v453cyg belongs to rather sparse group of high - mass close binary systems for which accurate physical properties have been measured for both components . in the most recent study of v453cyg , southworth ,",
    "maxted & smalley ( 2004b ; hereafter sms04 ) analysed new spectroscopic observations and previously published light curves , obtaining masses of @xmath4@xmath5  and @xmath6@xmath5 , and radii of @xmath7@xmath8  and @xmath9@xmath8 .",
    "the high precision of the radius measurements was helped by the geometry of the v453cyg system , which exhibits deep and total eclipses .",
    "sms04 derived effective temperatures of @xmath10k and @xmath11k from the equivalent widths of several he and he lines , using an analysis based on local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) synthetic spectra but with a correction for non - lte effects .",
    "v453cyg is known to display the phenomenon of apsidal motion , which can be used as a probe of the internal structure of the components of an eccentric binary system ( e.g.  claret & gimnez 1993 ) .",
    "sms04 found an apsidal period of @xmath12yr , which gives the structural parameter value in the abstract of sms04 is incorrect : the correct value is given in sms04 ( their section7.2 ) and here . ]",
    "the masses , radii , @xmath2s and @xmath14 of v453cyg match theoretical predictions for an age of @xmath15myr and an approximately solar metal abundance .",
    "the primary component ( the hotter and more massive star ) is reaching the terminal age of its main sequence lifetime ( tams ) whilst the secondary star is roughly halfway through its ms life .",
    "the significant difference between the properties of the two stars means that v453cyg is a very useful system for testing evolutionary models .    in this work",
    "we analyse the spectroscopy of v453cyg obtained by sms04 and by simon & sturm ( 1994 ) in order to obtain new @xmath2s and accurate chemical abundances for the stars .",
    "v453cyg was targeted by sms04 as part of a program to study debs which are members of open clusters ( see southworth , maxted & smalley 2004a ; southworth et al .",
    "it is a probable member of ngc6871 , so our results can be compared to published analyses of single stars which are also cluster members .",

    "due to the serious problems of line blending and high rotational velocities , abundances have been measured for only a few high - mass stars in double - lined binary systems .",
    "prior to the invention of spd ( simon & sturm 1994 ) some helium abundances in high - mass binaries were determined from equivalent widths measured using gaussian fitting ( lyubimkov 1998 ; pavlovski 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the use of spd has allowed helium abundances to be measured for four close binaries : dhcep ( sturm & simon 1994 ) , ycyg ( simon et al .",
    "1994 ) , v578mon ( hensberge et al .",
    "2000 ) , and dwcar ( southworth & clausen 2007 ) .",
    "preliminary results have also been announced for v380cyg ( pavlovski et al .",
    "2005 ) , and v478cyg and cwcep ( pavlovski & tamajo 2007 ) . finally , freyhammer et al .  ( 2001 ) have derived helium abundances for the components of cpd@xmath1759@xmath182628 by fitting theoretical spectra .",
    "lyubimkov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found an enrichment of helium during the ms evolution of their sample of stars , although many theoretical evolutionary models ( e.g.  schaller et al .  1992 ) predict no surface enrichment of helium or other cno - cycle elements .",
    "however , more recent theoretical studies ( maeder & meynet 2000 ; heger & langer 2000 ) have found that rotationally induced mixing can affect the chemical composition of the surface layer of high - mass stars even whilst they are on the ms . due to cno processing in the stellar core ,",
    "he and n should be enriched and c and o depleted .",
    "the strength of these effects depends on initial rotational velocity , so observational constraints can be used to both calibrate theoretical models and check their predictions ( e.g.  venn et al .",
    "2000 ) .    the observations of 100 galactic b stars by lyubimkov et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2004 ) have confirmed that helium overabundance is correlated with stellar age expressed as a fraction of its ms lifetime .",
    "large spectroscopic surveys of ob stars in our galaxy and the large and small magellanic clouds ( hunter et al .",
    "2008 ) have further confirmed this effect at a range of metallicities .",
    "unfortunately , investigations using single stars suffer from the low accuracy with which their masses , radii and ages can be measured .",
    "further work must therefore concentrate on binary stars , where all these properties can be measured to within a few percent ( e.g.  sms04 ) .",
    "the subsample of high - mass stars in the sample of ob stars studied by lyubimkov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show helium enrichment during their ms lifetimes , which has been found previously for close binaries ( see lyubimkov 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "in two recent studies in which large samples of b stars were analysed , progressively increasing helium enrichment from the zams to the tams was found ( lyubimkov et al .",
    "2004 , huang & gies 2006 ) .",
    "both studies saw this effect over their whole mass ranges , with large enrichments for high - mass stars .",
    "moreover , huang & gies noted that the effect is large among the faster rotators ( see their fig .",
    "lyubimkov et al .",
    "derived @xmath19  both from helium lines and from o , while huang & gies ( working with only a limited spectral range around h@xmath20 ) accepted @xmath21kms@xmath22  for all their sample after considering the discussion of @xmath19  in lyubimkov et al .",
    "therefore , the agreement achieved by these studies may depend on their use of a common @xmath19 .",
    "so far , in the sample of ob binaries studied by spd and cited above , no ms star has been found to have a helium enrichment . to this list",
    "we add now both components of v453cyg .",
    "the ages of the stars on the list lie between 0 and 0.8 of their ms lifetimes , with v453cyga contributing the upper limit .",
    "possible explanations for the non - detection of any changes in elemental abundances are moderate rotational velocity and tidal effects between the components . in this context",
    "it is interesting that detailed abundance analyses of about a dozen @xmath23 cephei stars ( morel et al .",
    "2006 ) has given an average helium abundance of @xmath24 , with a range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "these objects are slowly - rotating stars in advanced phases of their ms lifetimes and do not show enhanced helium abundances .",
    "the @xmath2  and @xmath3  of v453cyga fall within the range of their sample , and this star also does not show enhanced helium .",
    "these two results are in excellent agreement and corroborate previous finding of herrero et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who found a very clear dependence of helium enrichment on rotational velocity , but not on fractional lifetime on the ms , for o - type stars .    in section[sec :",
    "he ] we determined the he abundance in v453cyga by two approaches : ( i ) simultaneous line - profile fitting allowing @xmath19  to be a free parameter ; ( ii ) fixing @xmath19  to the value obtained from o lines . when using a fixed @xmath19  we found a normal helium abundance ( @xmath27 ) , but when @xmath19  was a free parameter we found a helium overabundance ( @xmath28 ) and also erratic metal abundances .",
    "we therefore reject the helium enrichment scenario and caution that it is crucial to carefully consider the value of @xmath19  in similar studies .",
    "binary and multiple stellar systems are our primary source of fundamental measurements of the basic physical properties of stars .",
    "modern observational data and analytical tools allow us to determine stellar masses and radii with accuracies of 1% or better , which in turn yields surface gravity measurements accurate to a few hundredths of a dex . when combined with advanced spectroscopic and abundance analysis techniques it is now possible to perform detailed tests of the rotation and magnetic effects included in modern theoretical evolutionary models .    in this work",
    "we have studied the eclipsing double - lined spectroscopic binary v453cyg , a system which contains two stars with accurately measured masses and radii .",
    "v453cyga is approaching the tams and v453cygb has completed about half of its ms phase .",
    "these characteristics make v453cyg ideal for testing the ms chemical evolution of high - mass stars , which is affected by convection , rotational mixing , and magnetic fields .    through spd of several sets of phase - resolved high - resolution spectroscopy we have obtained the individual spectra of the two stars . by fitting the hydrogen line profiles with non - lte synthetic spectra , we have measured the effective temperatures for the two stars to be @xmath29k and @xmath30k .",
    "the high precision of these measurements was achieved because the surface gravities of the two stars are known to within 0.01dex ( sms04 ) .",
    "the @xmath2s are larger than have been found previously , and are supported by the strmgren photometric indices of the system .",
    "the new @xmath2  values imply a distance of @xmath31pc to v453cyg ( using theoretical bolometric corrections ) , which is in good agreement with most literature values but still shorter than the distance of @xmath32pc found for ngc6871 by massey et al .",
    "the predictions of theoretical stellar evolutionary models are unable to match the properties of v453cyg .",
    "using the disentangled spectra we have measured the helium and metal abundances in the photospheres of the two stars by fitting non - lte synthetic spectra to the observed line profiles .",
    "the metal abundances for the secondary star were estimated by differential analysis to a template star of similar @xmath2   and @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the helium in the photosphere of the primary has a solar abundance if we adopt a microturbulent velocity obtained from metallic lines .",
    "this result does not contradict evolutionary calculations ( meynet & maeder 2000 ; heger & langer 2000 ) because a slight helium enrichment is predicted only for highly rotating stars , and/or after tams . also , as is expected for the stars which were formed from the same interstellar material , no significant difference in the chemical composition between the two components is apparent .",
    "their photospheric abundances resemble those of the typical galactic ob stars ( c.f .",
    "herrero 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "we are planning to extend our analysis to larger numbers of spectral lines , which will require new spectroscopic observations with a wider wavelength coverage .",
    "this will make it possible to refine the present abundance analysis , and to address more thoroughly the question of which @xmath19  to adopt for different ions .",
    "chelle spectroscopic observations will be well suited to this task .",
