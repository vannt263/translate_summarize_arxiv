    "this article describes the macaulay 2 package pierimaps , which defines maps of representations of the general linear group @xmath0 of the form @xmath4 and presents them as degree 0 maps @xmath5 of free modules over the polynomial ring @xmath6 . here",
    "dominant weights of @xmath0 are identified with weakly decreasing sequences @xmath7 of length @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes the irreducible representation of highest weight @xmath7 .",
    "such maps are of general importance , and appeared recently in the work of eisenbud , flystad and weyman @xcite .",
    "the package also describes certain related maps in characteristic @xmath10 .",
    "we give some context for this work and then describe the contents of this article .",
    "let @xmath11 be a field , and @xmath12 $ ] the polynomial ring in @xmath8 variables .",
    "in a recent paper of eisenbud and schreyer @xcite , a theorem regarding the `` shape '' of minimal free resolutions of cohen ",
    "macaulay @xmath13-modules was established . given a cohen ",
    "macaulay @xmath13-module @xmath1 , the * betti diagram * @xmath14 is the number of generators of degree @xmath15 in the @xmath3th syzygy module of a minimal free resolution of @xmath1 .",
    "a betti diagram is * pure * if for each @xmath3 , @xmath16 for at most one @xmath15 . in this case , we let @xmath17 be the degree sequence of @xmath18 : that is , @xmath19 for all @xmath3 .",
    "the theorem mentioned above states that any betti diagram of a cohen  macaulay module is a rational linear combination of pure betti diagrams .",
    "the herzog  khl equations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) show that each strictly increasing degree sequence determines the corresponding betti diagram up to a rational multiple . for @xmath20 , eisenbud , flystad , and weyman",
    "@xcite constructed pure free resolutions for each degree sequence which live in the category of @xmath21 representations .",
    "eisenbud and schreyer give a characteristic free construction which gives different rational multiples of the betti diagrams in general .",
    "it is still not completely known which multiples can and can not come from the betti diagram of a graded module .",
    "for example , it is an interesting open problem to determine for a given degree sequence the smallest integer multiple given by the herzog ",
    "khl equations which actually comes from a module .",
    "it is the goal of this article to describe how these resolutions can be represented concretely in macaulay  2 @xcite .",
    "one can find @xmath22-forms for these maps and work in positive characteristic , and one such @xmath22-form is implemented , but in general it will not produce pure resolutions . we should mention that this choice of @xmath22-form is not unique .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how often the characteristic @xmath10 resolutions will be pure , and to construct @xmath22-forms which give equivariant pure resolutions in positive characteristic .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section  [ representations ] , we review a construction for representations of @xmath0 . in section  [ purefreesection ] ,",
    "we give the construction of eisenbud , flystad , and weyman , and its extension to characteristic @xmath10 . in section  [ combinatorialsection ]",
    ", we describe the differentials in terms of bases , in the way that it is implemented in pierimaps , and illustrate an example .",
    "finally , in section  [ m2code ] we give some examples of macaulay 2 code which show how one can use this package .",
    "in this section , we present a construction for irreducible polynomial representations of the rational algebraic group @xmath0 which is convenient for our purposes .",
    "let @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) be a partition and @xmath25 .",
    "the * young diagram * of @xmath7 is a pictorial representation of @xmath7 : we draw @xmath8 rows ( some may be empty ) of boxes with @xmath26 boxes in the @xmath3th row , making sure that each row is left - justified .",
    "the notation @xmath27 refers to the box in the @xmath3th row and @xmath15th column .",
    "a * filling * of shape @xmath7 is an assignment of the numbers @xmath28 ( repetitions allowed ) to the boxes of the young diagram of @xmath7 . by picking some order on the boxes of @xmath7 , we get an action of the symmetric group @xmath29 on the fillings of @xmath7 .",
    "we ll say that @xmath30 is * row - preserving * if it permutes the rows of @xmath7 amongst themselves . the * schur module",
    "* , but in characteristic 0 , it is isomorphic to what is usually called the schur module . ]",
    "@xmath9 is the rational vector space with basis given by the fillings @xmath31 of @xmath7 together with the following relations :    1 .",
    "( symmetric relation ) @xmath32 for any row - preserving permutation @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   ( shuffle relation ) for @xmath3 and @xmath15 such that @xmath27 and @xmath34 are boxes of @xmath7 , let @xmath35",
    ". then @xmath36 , where the sum is over all permutations which fix all boxes not in @xmath37 .    for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.1.15 ) where our notion of schur module is called a weyl functor , and is denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the above presentation implicitly replaces the use of divided powers with symmetric powers , but this distinction is irrelevant in characteristic 0 .",
    "a filling is a * semistandard tableau * if the numbers are weakly increasing from left to right along rows , and strictly increasing from top to bottom along columns .",
    "a basis for @xmath9 ( over @xmath39 ) is given by the semistandard tableaux of shape @xmath7 .",
    "we define an action of @xmath0 on @xmath9 as follows . given a filling @xmath31 , let @xmath40 be its entries ( in some order )",
    ". for @xmath41 , set @xmath42 where the sum is over all index sets @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the filling obtained by replacing each @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "we will need * pieri s formula * : if @xmath47 is a partition with one row , then @xmath48 where @xmath49 ranges over all partitions with at most @xmath8 parts obtained from @xmath7 by adding @xmath50 boxes , no two of which are in the same column .",
    "thus there are inclusions ( unique up to scalar multiple ) @xmath51 which we will call * pieri inclusions*. we remark that this direct sum decomposition is only valid in characteristic 0 , and is the main barrier to extending the setup of this article to positive characteristic .",
    "fix a degree sequence @xmath52 . define a partition @xmath53 by @xmath54 , and for @xmath55 , define partitions @xmath56",
    "let @xmath57 $ ] , and define @xmath13-modules @xmath58 for @xmath59 by @xmath60 ( here @xmath61 denotes a grading shift by @xmath62 . )",
    "the natural action of @xmath0 on @xmath63 and on @xmath64 gives an action of @xmath0 on @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath66 , and that @xmath67 is obtained from @xmath68 by adding boxes only in the @xmath3th row , so there exists a pieri inclusion @xmath69 identifying @xmath70 gives a degree 0 map @xmath71 given by @xmath72 .",
    "[ equivariantres ] with the notation above , @xmath73 is a @xmath0-equivariant minimal graded free resolution of @xmath74 , which is pure of degree @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath75 is isomorphic , as a @xmath0 representation , to the direct sum of all irreducible summands of @xmath76 corresponding to the partitions that do not contain @xmath77 , and in particular is a module of finite length .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) . we should emphasize that our notation for partitions differs from that of ( loc .",
    "cit . ) in that the notions of rows and columns are interchanged .",
    "an implementation of the map @xmath78 is given in the method purefree in pierimaps .",
    "one can then compute the remaining maps and compose them , or compute a minimal free resolution using macaulay 2 .",
    "the extension of this construction to characteristic @xmath10 in general does not produce pure resolutions .",
    "the idea is to clear the denominators in the matrix giving a pieri inclusion , remove the torsion from the cokernel , and then reduce coefficients modulo @xmath10 , for a given prime .",
    "this is also implemented in the method purefree : the user need only specify a characteristic .",
    "we wish to describe how the pieri inclusions work in terms of the bases of semistandard tableaux of the schur modules @xmath9 .",
    "the pieri inclusion which induces the map @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 and @xmath68 is obtained from @xmath67 by removing @xmath81 boxes from the @xmath3th row .",
    "so to describe this map , we first describe the case @xmath82 . in this case , the map was described by olver in @xcite . for the general case",
    ", one can iterate this process of removing one box at a time and compose the maps .",
    "it needs to be proved ( though it is not hard ) , that such a composition is the desired map , and in fact , if one removes boxes from multiple rows , the order in which the boxes are removed is irrelevant ( up to nonzero scalar multiple ) .",
    "suppose we have a partition @xmath7 with @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the partition resulting from adding a box to the @xmath84th row of @xmath7 .",
    "set @xmath85 , and for @xmath86 , define @xmath87 . given @xmath88 where @xmath89 $ ] is a monomial and @xmath31 is a filling of @xmath49 , we first interpret the @xmath90 as a `` zeroth '' row of @xmath31 consisting of @xmath91 boxes filled with @xmath92 @xmath3 s .",
    "we ll call this a * shape*. given numbers @xmath93 , define @xmath94 to be the sum of all shapes obtained from @xmath88 by removing a box along with its entry ( and then the boxes to the right of it get shifted one to the left ) from row @xmath15 and moving it to the end of row @xmath3 . then set @xmath95 the desired map @xmath96 is now the alternating sum @xmath97 .",
    "we give an example to illustrate all of the above .",
    "[ combinpieri ] let @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and consider the element @xmath101 where @xmath31 is the semistandard tableau @xmath102 we think of @xmath31 as having a `` row 0 '' which is an empty row on top of @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath103 , then @xmath104 which we really think of as @xmath105 in the module @xmath106 \\otimes_{\\mathbf{q}}{\\mathbf{s}}_{(2,1 ) } v$ ] .",
    "the equality follows from the relations described in section  [ representations ] . in this case ,",
    "we illustrate some of the main uses of pierimaps .",

    "the bases of @xmath111 and @xmath112 can be listed with the commands standardtableaux(3 , \\{3,1 } ) and standardtableaux(3 , \\{2,1 } ) , respectively .",
    "for example , the first command has \\{\\{0,0,0 } , \\{1 } } as its first basis element , which is meant to represent the semistandard tableau @xmath113 .",
    "alternatively , this map can be produced with the command pieri(\\{3,1,0 } , \\{1 } , a ) because the partition @xmath114 is obtained by subtracting 1 from the first entry of @xmath115 .",
