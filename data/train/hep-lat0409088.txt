    "the study of semi - leptonic @xmath0 decays is currently of great interest as it provides us with a test of the standard model .",
    "a key process is that of @xmath1 semi - leptonic decay , however , because the @xmath0 meson is much heavier than the final states , the recoil momenta of the @xmath2 meson can be large .",
    "this leads to both problems of small signal to noise ratios and significant discretisation errors if @xmath3 is large .",
    "computations involving the simulation of heavy quarks at low momentum can be dealt with using the nrqcd formalism @xcite , where the dynamics of interest are isolated by re - expressing the lagrangian as an expansion in @xmath4 .",
    "although this framework for dealing with heavy quarks reduces the impact of discretisation errors , it is not designed to deal with large momenta . in this case , a suitable formalism to use is moving nrqcd ( mnrqcd ) @xcite which allows the momentum to be shared more evenly between the initial and final states .",
    "mnrqcd is developed in two stages , the first of which involves a choice of lattice frame such that the @xmath0 meson is moving , thus reducing the magnitude of the pion s recoil momentum .",
    "secondly , an effective field theory must be constructed for the heavy quark with non - zero velocity . in mnrqcd ,",
    "the heavy quark s momentum is written as @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the 4-velocity of the @xmath7 quark which is treated exactly , and @xmath8 is the small internal momentum ( of the heavy quark ) inside the @xmath0 meson which is discretised on the lattice .    as with the non - moving case",
    ", mnrqcd is constructed from a set of non - renormalisable interactions , each of which is accompanied by a coupling coefficient which can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "the heavy quark s self energy in nrqcd has been calculated to @xmath9 @xcite . here",
    "we present a calculation of the one - loop renormalisation parameters that appear in the mnrqcd lagrangian .",
    "in addition to the overall energy shift , mass and wavefunction renormalisation , we must also now calculate the renormalisation of the external momentum .",
    "this renormalisation is close to one because of the remnants of re - parameterisation invariance on the lattice .",
    "in this section , we present the lagrangian used in this calculation and define the renormalisation parameters .      the lagrangian is defined as @xmath10    where @xmath11    and @xmath12 ^ 2 \\right ) -    i{\\bf v}.{\\bf \\nabla}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eqn .",
    "[ l ] , @xmath13 is a positive parameter that stabilises the high momentum modes in the heavy quark propagator .",
    "the mean - field parameter @xmath14 is used to improve the match between lattice and continuum theories .",
    "the gluon fields are discretised using the wilson plaquette gauge action .",
    "this lagrangian includes all spin - independent corrections up to @xmath15 .",
    "the feynman rules are calculated by expanding the @xmath16 fields in terms of the coupling @xmath17 .",
    "following a fourier transform to momentum space , the quark ( gluon ) propagator is defined as the inverse of the term that is bilinear in the quark ( gluon ) fields .",
    "vertices of different order are selected according to their order in @xmath17 .",
    "the rules are defined in the feynman gauge and the infra - red divergence is regulated by introducing a small gluon mass .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath18 , we recover the feynman rules for the corresponding nrqcd action .",
    "the heavy quark s self energy @xmath19 , represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ diag ] , along with tadpole counterterms from the @xmath14 factors , is defined by writing the inverse quark propagator @xmath20 in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the free propagator .",
    "the self energy can also be expanded for small @xmath23 @xcite to give @xmath24    [ scale=.32,height=.24,width=.22]diags.eps    combining the expansion of @xmath19 with the quark propagator , to @xmath9 , gives @xmath25    re - arranging this expression , we obtain @xmath26    the renormalisation parameters are then defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the energy shift is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "we also note that since the tadpole counterterms are the same for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , these factors will cancel in @xmath34 . in order to compute the renormalisation parameters",
    ", we need to isolate the coefficients , @xmath35 , of individual terms appearing in eqn .",
    "this is equivalent to taking derivatives of the diagrams with respect to an appropriate choice of momentum .",
    "the quark propagator is zero for @xmath36 , so by choosing the momentum flow appropriately , poles in the quark propagator can be avoided .",
    "the diagrams have internal loop momentum @xmath37 and contain a pole in the gluon propagator in the @xmath38 plane .",
    "the integrals are therefore evaluated analytically in the complex plane ( @xmath39 ) which leads to a 3-d integral that can be evaluated numerically using the vegas package .",
    "the calculations were performed at @xmath40 with several different values of the stabilisation parameter and velocity .",
    "these values match those used in the numerical calculations @xcite which were carried out on wilson glue configurations at @xmath41 .",
    "we take @xmath42 .",
    "the results are checked for invariance under @xmath43 .",
    "[ scale=.3,height=.325,width=.49]plotesim_corr.ps    preliminary results for the heavy - light binding energy @xmath44 as a function of the bare velocity",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "the simulated energy @xcite clearly exhibits velocity dependence as @xmath4 approaches 1 .",
    "after subtraction of the energy shift , the physical binding energy is independent of @xmath45 , as it should be .",
    "preliminary values for the renormalisation of the external momentum @xmath46 as a function of the bare velocity are presented in fig .",
    "[ vel ] . up to lattice artefacts",
    ", the lagrangian has an invariance under arbitrary shifts of momentum between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and this protects @xmath34 from becoming very different from 1 @xcite .",
