    "the quantum nature of light is exemplified by the fact that it can exhibit both undular ( wavelike ) and corpuscular ( particlelike ) properties under different circumstances .",
    "using an atomic cascade to produce a pair of nearly simultaneous photons  @xcite , grangier et al  @xcite demonstrated that a heralded photon can either interfere with itself in a mach - zehnder interferometer or be shown to either wholly transmit or reflect by a beam splitter , which demonstrates complementarity for light .",
    "more recently the continuous trade - off of undular and corpuscular features in a quantum non - demolition measurement  @xcite was demonstrated using a non - deterministic linear optical gate  @xcite .",
    "technically , nonclassical light corresponds to field states whose glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-representation is singular  @xcite ; practically nonclassicality can be established by demonstrating photon antibunching  @xcite or using optical homodyne tomography  @xcite to demonstrate that the wigner function ( which is a gaussian convolution of the @xmath0-representation ) exhibits squeezing  @xcite or is negative over some region  @xcite .",
    "recently waks , diamanti , sanders , bartlett , and yamamoto ( wdsby )  @xcite exploited cutting edge photon counting technology ( using the visible light photon counter  @xcite ) to demonstrate that a single beam emitted by parametric down conversion ( pdc ) is nonclassical by measuring its photon statistics and avoiding auxiliary assumptions such as detector efficiency .",
    "here we reinterpret the wdsby data using klyshko s powerful criterion for direct detection of nonclassicality via photon statistics  @xcite , and we demonstrate nonclassicality of twin beam pdc by using two photon counters and lee s extension of klyshko s criterion to two beams  @xcite .    although the simultaneity of photon pair production by twin - beam , or nondegenerate , pdc is well known  @xcite , leading to its applications as a heralded photon source  @xcite and for tests of bell s inequalities  @xcite , the joint photon statistics of the twin beams have not previously been directly measured .",
    "these statistics are necessary for a direct confirmation of the nonclassicality of twin - beam pdc , which is one of the most important tools in quantum optics as a source of correlated or entangled pairs of photons  @xcite and , more recently , as a source of entangled four - tuples of photons  @xcite .",
    "we have performed this direct photon counting experiment and obtained joint photon counting data for the twin beams and thereby showed that these twin beams are truly nonclassical .",
    "theoretical predictions suggest that the beams should be nonclassical , but theories generally treat the twin - beam pdc output as a two - mode squeezed vacuum state  @xcite @xmath1 with @xmath2 and the argument of @xmath3 dependent on the phase of the pump laser field for the pdc . for degenerate pdc , the state  ( [ eq:2modesqvac ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath4 and the photon number distribution is @xmath5 this state corresponds to a joint photon number distribution for the two beams , which is given by @xmath6 klyshko considered a state of the type emitted by an ideal degenerate pdc , and lee s analysis of photon counting correlations explicitly assumed two - mode states and included a treatment of the two - mode squeezed vacuum  ( [ eq:2modesqvac ] ) .",
    "the reality of pdc and photon counting is somewhat more complicated .",
    "the twin beams ( known as signal and idler fields ) are each multimode so the theoretical treatments of these outputs are not immediately applicable .",
    "in fact there are so many modes for each of the signal and idler beams that we observe a photon distribution over these modes that is poissonian .",
    "the poisson distribution originates from the fact that there so many signal and idler modes that the average number of pairs per mode is much less than one .",
    "this means that each mode is predominantly a vacuum state with a small one - photon contribution and a negligible multi - photon contribution .",
    "thus , the generated signal is created by a sum of independent spontaneous emitters ( one for each mode ) , and , as each pair is created independently , the pair creation statistics must be a poisson distribution .",
    "this discrepancy in photon statistics between the usual theoretical treatment of pdc output  @xcite and experimental reality makes the direct measurement of joint photon counting statistics and verification of nonclassicality even more interesting and important .",
    "properties of twin - beam pdc have been explored in an elegant experiment by haderka et al  @xcite , but their approach is different in that they do not use two distinct photon counters on each beam .",
    "thus , inferences of nonclassicality rely on auxiliary assumptions that are not required by our approach such as taking into account the losses during transmission , quantum efficiency and internal noise of the camera and noise due to other light sources to obtain the joint signal - idler photon number distribution  @xcite .    to begin , we re - analyze the wdsby data for single beam pdc .",
    "wdsby  @xcite conclusively demonstrated nonclassicality using their data for one- , two- , and three - photon measured counts  @xmath7 , where we use the symbol  @xmath8 for the ideal probability and  @xmath9 for the measured probability .",
    "we will now compare their results to klyshko s criterion  @xcite .",
    "we introduce klyshko s criterion for two reasons : ( i )  klyshko s criterion demonstrates that the wdsby data violates classical bounds beyond the three - photon case studied by wdsby , and ( ii )  klyshko s criterion is a basis for lee s criterion  @xcite which we use for the analysis of the twin beams .",
    "wdsby used the fact that nonclassicality of light , defined by the singularity of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-representation holds if and only if the photocount distribution for the beam can not be expressed as a sum or integral of poisson distributions ( which corresponds to classical count distributions ) .",
    "specifically the photon count statistics  @xmath7 were irreconcilable with classical photon statistics ; thus photon counting provided a direct means for establishing that a single - beam light source is nonclassical .    to demonstrate nonclassical photon statistics , wdsby pumped a type - i phase - matched bbo crystal set up for collinear degenerate amplification with 20ns pulses of the fourth harmonic ( 266 nm ) of a q - switched nd : yag laser . in this configuration",
    ", the down - converted photons had half the energy of the pump ( 532 nm ) and travelled in the same direction .",
    "the pump was removed by a prism , while the down - conversion was focused by a 250 mm lens onto the vlpc detector .",
    "the detector output was amplified and then sent to a gated boxcar integrator , which was triggered by the laser .",
    "this configuration was used to measure the photon number distribution of the detected field .",
    "wdsby achieved a forty standard deviation violation of classicality , according to the criterion @xmath10 without any auxiliary assumptions about the detector or field .",
    "in fact klyshko s criterion preceded the wsby criterion and was the first proposal for a direct test of nonclassicality according to ` local properties ' of the photon number distribution ( pnd )  @xcite , @xmath11 by the replacement @xmath12 , the criterion applies to measured photon statistics rather than the ideal photon counting distribution .",
    "lee  @xcite refers to such tests of nonclassicality according to local properties of the pnd as type  ii , as opposed to the traditional version ( which lee calls type  i ) that employs inequalities on moments ( such as the mandel  @xmath13 parameter  @xcite ) .",
    "if criterion  ( [ eq : k ] ) is satisfied for any  @xmath14 , then the field is necessarily nonclassical . to compare with @xmath15 ,",
    "consider @xmath16 for klyshko s criterion applied to measured data : @xmath17 rearranging the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) yields the nonclassicality criterion @xmath18 an alternative criterion emerges from the nonclassicality criterion  ( [ eq : gammawdsby ] ) , which yields @xmath19 thus , combining klyshko s result for  @xmath20 and the wdsby result for @xmath15 , we obtain the general condition , based on measured results @xmath21 for nonclassicality being @xmath22 this condition is based on the best case by combining the wdsby @xmath15 criterion  ( [ eq : gammawdsby ] ) with klyshko s criterion for @xmath16 .",
    "( [ eq : combined ] ) can be further simplified : the two quantities in this equation coincide in the symmetric case that @xmath23 : then @xmath24 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath25 .",
    "we can thus rewrite condition  ( [ eq : combined ] ) as @xmath26 except for @xmath27 the first term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : combined ] ) is always smaller than the second term , and the two terms are equal when @xmath27 .",
    "thus klyshko s condition is stronger than the wdsby criterion , and another advantage of klyshko s general criterion over wdsby s criterion is that the latter only applies in the measured photon number distribution localized around  @xmath16 whereas klyshko s criterion explores nonclassicality for local regions of the photon number distribution around any @xmath28 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : klyshbound ] , we present a plot of @xmath29 vs  @xmath14 for the wdsby data .",
    "klyshko s criterion is violated for even numbers of photons between @xmath16 and @xmath30 .",
    "the limit of our measurement capability is nine photons , and all odd - number detections fail to violate klyshko s criterion as expected from joint distribution  ( [ eq:2modecounting ] ) .",
    "the reason why even - number counts violate the classical limit and odd - number counts do not is that the ideal photon number distribution is non - zero only for even - number counts .",
    "experimentally we detect odd - number counts due to finite detector quantum efficiency , but this does not lead to violation of the classical limit . fig .",
    "1 is especially important in demonstrating that nonclassicality of the beam is evident for all even photon numbers up to the limits imposed by our photon counter capabilities .",
    "experimental results for klyshko s figure of merit  @xmath31 vs photon number  @xmath14 for a single - mode field . ]",
    "now let us consider the twin - beam pdc and its joint photon counting statistics .",
    "we will use lee s generalization of klyshko s type  ii criterion to establish nonclassicality of the twin - beam pdc output directly from the joint photon counting data with no adjustments made for photodetection efficiency .",
    "we will need to adapt lee s criterion to accommodate the multi - mode aspect of the pdc output .",
    "lee introduces the non - classical criterion for two modes of a light field given by @xmath32 with  @xmath33 .",
    "the field is nonclassical if @xmath34 satisfies inequality  ( [ eq : r ] ) for any  @xmath35 and  @xmath36 .",
    "although lee s analysis supposes a two - mode field , this result is equally valid for a multimode field and the use of two photon counters , with some modes directed to one detector and other modes directed to the other detector .",
    "mode mismatches and lost modes are partially responsible for photon counter inefficiencies .",
    "as we do not employ auxiliary assumptions , the onus is on us to enhance efficiency to ensure that inequality  ( [ eq : r ] ) is satisfied , and not to resort to modeling these losses and adjusting the photon statistics according to these assumptions .",
    "we define @xmath35 as the number of signal photons and @xmath36 as the number of idler photons .",
    "it is convenient to determine the conditional probabilities for @xmath36 photons given a count of @xmath35 at the other detector , denoted by  @xmath37 .",
    "the conditional and joint number counting probabilities are related by the formula @xmath38 as explained in the previous section , the counting statistics for each detector is poissonian distribution with @xmath39 where  @xmath40 is the mean photon number summed over all the signal modes .",
    "the choice of the poisson distribution is justified by the fact that there are many more signal and idler modes than photons distributed amongst these modes  @xcite .",
    "thus , each mode is predominantly a vacuum state with a small one - photon contribution and a negligible multi - photon contribution .",
    "the photon distribution across all modes of each beam is therefore binomial , which , in the limit of a large number of modes and fixed number of photons , is poissonian .",
    "this poissonian distribution contrasts with the ` thermal ' photon statistics for an output mode of ideal nondegenerate pdc , which follows from  ( [ eq:2modesqvac ] ) .",
    "lee s expression  ( [ eq : r ] ) can be revised in terms of conditional probabilities .",
    "using the simple relation @xmath41 , we rewrite the criterion as @xmath42 in our experiments , the mean photon number collected over all the modes is @xmath43 .",
    "experimental setup for measuring violation of lee s inequality . ]    the experimental setup for generating twin photon beams for measuring the lee non - classical criterion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "a 266 nm pump source is generated from the fourth harmonic of a q - switched nd : yag laser .",
    "the pump pulses have a duration of 20ns , and a repetition rate of 45khz .",
    "a dispersion prism separates the fourth harmonic from the residual second harmonic , which is used to illuminate a high speed photodiode to generate a triggering signal .",
    "the fourth harmonic pumps a bbo crystal , which is set for non - collinear degenerate phase - matching .    in this condition ,",
    "the signal and idler waves are both 532 nm in wavelength and have a divergence angle of 1 degree from the pump .",
    "the pump is loosely focused before the bbo crystal to achieve a minimum waist at the collection lens .",
    "this results in a sharper two - photon image which enhances the collection efficiency .",
    "the pump power is set to @xmath44 . using the count rate on the detectors and known values of the detector quantum efficiency , the average pair creation rate at this pump power",
    "is measured to be one pair per pump laser pulse .",
    "two vlpc detectors are used in this experiment .",
    "each detector is held in a separate helium bath cryostat and cooled down to 6 - 7k , which is the optimum operating temperature .",
    "the vlpc is sensitive to photons with wavelengths of up to 30@xmath45 m , so it must be shielded from room temperature thermal radiation .",
    "this is achieved by encasing the detector in a copper shield , which is cooled down to 6k .",
    "acrylic windows at the front of the copper shield are used as infra red filters .",
    "these windows are highly transparent at visible wavelengths and simultaneously nearly opaque at 2 - 30@xmath45 m wavelengths .",
    "vlpc  1 is used as the triggering detector which detects the number of photons generated in the signal arm on a given laser pulse .",
    "the output of vlpc  1 is amplified by an integrating amplifier , which generates an electrical pulse whose height is proportional to the number of emitted electrons .",
    "the height of the pulse is discriminated by a single channel analyzer ( sca ) . a logical and",
    "is performed between the output of the sca and the output of the photodiode to reject all detection events which occur outside of the pulse duration .",
    "the output of vlpc  2 , which measures photons in the idler arm , is amplified and connected to the signal input of a boxcar integrator . on each pulse from the sca ,",
    "the output of vlpc  2 is integrated over a 2@xmath45s window , which is sufficiently large to encompass the entire electrical pulse ( determined by the bandwidth of subsequent amplifiers ) .",
    "the pulse area is proportional to the number of detected photons . by measuring the pulse area histogram of the vlpc",
    ", we can therefore measure @xmath37 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the number of photons in the signal and idler arm respectively .",
    ".[tab : leebound]experimental results for lee s figure of merit  @xmath46 vs photon number  @xmath14 for twin beams [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     the experimental results are given in table  [ tab : leebound ] . since we can only measure @xmath35 from one to four photons , we only obtain expressions for the lee bound for @xmath47 . in the ideal case where we have perfect detection efficiency and no dark counts",
    ", we would have @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 the lee bound would not be well defined because @xmath51 , causing a divergence . in the presence of detection losses",
    ", we would still expect the best violations when @xmath49 , with worse results in the off - diagonal term .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : leebound ] , this is indeed the case .",
    "when @xmath52 , we obtain extremely good violations of the lee criterion , whereas off - diagonal terms yield worse violations or no violations at all .",
    "in summary we have demonstrated directly that twin - beam pdc produces non - classical light .",
    "as pdc is one of the most important tools for quantum optics , it seems surprising that the nonclassical nature of pdc output has not been directly verified before .",
    "one reason for not having previously establishing nonclassicality of twin - beam pdc is the requirement for sophisticated , modern photon counters and correlations of their data .",
    "another reason for the novelty of our results is that only recently has direct testing of nonclassicality via the local properties of the measured photon count distribution been understood  @xcite .",
    "our method of directly measuring photon counts for twin beams applies to multiple - beam fields and testing the local properties of the measured photon count distribution provides a valuable , practical means for establishing nonclassicality of light , especially in cases where the photons are not anti - bunched .    _",
