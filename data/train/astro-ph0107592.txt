    "the question of the origin of most energetic particles observed in cosmic rays at energies @xmath5  ev , often called extremely high energy cosmic rays ( ehecrs ) , is a subject of intensive astrophysical speculations and debates . within the conventional acceleration ( or `` bottom - up '' ) scenarios , the powerful radiogalaxies , active galactic nuclei and clusters of galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as well as transient events like the sources of @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite are believed to be the most probable sites of production of ehe cosmic rays . these models have , however , a difficulty connected with the large , typically @xmath6 distances to the most prominent representatives of these source populations . indeed ,",
    "if the observed ehe cosmic rays are protons produced in distant extragalactic sources , their interaction with the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background radiation ( mbr ) should give rise to the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) spectral cutoff . depending on the characteristic distance scale to the ensemble of sources responsible for the bulk of the observed ehe cosmic ray flux , the position of the cutoff is expected between @xmath7 and @xmath8  ev ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the registration of the ehecr events close to @xmath8  ev by haverah park , fly s eye , yakutsk , and agasa detectors ( for review see refs.@xcite ) pose a serious challenge for any of these conventional models .",
    "this difficulty initiated a quite different approach to the solution of the problem of origin of ehe cosmic rays ",
    "the hypothesis of _ non - acceleration _ ( or `` top - down '' ) scenario which assumes that the highest energy cosmic rays are result of decay of hypothetical massive relic particles originating from early cosmological epochs ( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a distinct feature of the `` top - down '' models of ehecrs is an unusually high content of @xmath0-rays with the gamma / proton ratio @xmath9 at @xmath10  ev @xcite .",
    "thus the gamma / proton ratio can serve as a conclusive diagnostic tool for observational proof ( or rejection ) of the `` top - down '' scenarios .",
    "actually , a non - negligible content of @xmath0-rays into the ehe cosmic rays is expected also in the conventional particle acceleration models . within these models",
    "the highest energy @xmath0-rays are contributed through the decay of secondary @xmath11-mesons produced at interactions of ehecrs with 2.7 k mbr @xcite .",
    "if the average magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is less than @xmath12  g , the development of the ultrarelativistic electron - photon cascades in the field of 2.7 k mbr makes the attenuation length of ehe @xmath0-rays at @xmath10  ev larger than the attenuation length of protons . therefore , the @xmath0-ray content in ehe cosmic ray flux depends strongly on the typical distances to the cosmic ray sources , and on the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field",
    ". it could be as large as 10 per cent in the case of homogeneous distribution of the ehecr sources in the universe , but less than 1 per cent if the bulk of the observed ehecr flux is contributed by relatively nearby sources concentrated in our local supercluster of galaxies .",
    "thus the measurements of the gamma / proton ratio in ehe cosmic rays by forthcoming powerful instruments like the auger observatory or the telescope array ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) would not only allow crucial tests to distinguish between the `` top - down '' and `` bottom - up '' scenarios , but also can provide important constraints on the spatial distribution of the ehecr accelerators within the conventional `` bottom - up '' models .",
    "the effective separation of @xmath0-ray induced showers from the proton - induced showers is possible because of noticeable differences in the development of electromagnetic and hadronic cascades .",
    "starting from energies of about 10  tev , the low - energy muon content becomes a reliable criterion for recognition of electromagnetic showers @xcite ) . at energies",
    "@xmath13  ev the content of muons in the electromagnetic showers increases with an increase of energy significantly faster than in the hadronic cascades @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper based on detailed numerical calculations of characteristics of electromagnetic showers , using the so - called adjoint equation technique ( see for review @xcite ) , generally confirm this effect .",
    "however , the present detailed numerical study shows that the prediction of ref.@xcite concerning the absolute muon number , based on an approximate analytical approach , was significantly overestimated .    at primary energies above @xmath14  ev the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect",
    "@xcite leads to significant suppressions of the bethe - heitler cross - sections for the pair - production and bremsstrahlung processes in the earth s atmosphere , and thus dramatically changes the character of development of electromagnetic showers . in practice , however , the interesting features of electromagnetic showers caused by the lpm effect do not appear in a `` pure '' form , but are largely compensated by another effect connected with interactions of ehe @xmath0-rays with the geomagnetic field ( gmf ) @xcite . remarkably , for the combination of relevant parameters , namely the strength and orientation of the geomagnetic field from one side , and the height , density and the mean atomic number of the earth s atmosphere from another side , these two effects start to `` operate '' almost simultaneously , at energies above several times @xmath14  ev .",
    "the interaction of @xmath0-rays with the gmf by @xmath15 pair production does not imply , however , absorption of primary photons .",
    "in fact , the secondary ( pair produced ) electrons and positrons in the same geomagnetic field quickly produce a bunch of synchrotron photons with energies typically between @xmath16 and @xmath14  ev .",
    "the secondary photons initiate a large number of simultaneous electromagnetic cascades in the atmosphere .",
    "because almost the whole energy of the primary photon is re - distributed between the synchrotron photons , the superposition of these showers mimics a single electromagnetic shower with total energy rather close to the energy of the primary particle .",
    "moreover , because of the relatively low energies of the bunch photons , the lpm effect is essentially `` switched off '' , and the longitudinal profile of the shower returns to the `` standard '' shape of electromagnetic showers without the signature of the lpm effect @xcite . for typical strengths of the gmf of",
    "about @xmath17  g and for energies of primary @xmath0-rays @xmath10  ev , this interesting interference of two strong effects becomes unavoidable almost at all arrival directions of primary @xmath0-rays .",
    "therefore , any study of electromagnetic showers of such high energies requires thorough treatment of both the lpm and gmf effects .",
    "the depth profiles of the electronic component of ehe electromagnetic showers including these two effects have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "recently the characteristics of the muon component have been calculated by capdevielle et.al .",
    "@xcite using the corsika monte carlo code .",
    "they took into account the lpm effect , but ignored the interactions of the primary @xmath0-rays with the geomagnetic field .",
    "we generally confirm the results of these studies , but significantly extend the range of calculated characteristics .",
    "in particular , we calculated such basic parameters of electromagnetic showers as the electron size , the depth profiles of cascade particles , the content and the lateral distribution of muons and compared them with the relevant parameters of hadronic showers .",
    "in calculations of characteristics of electromagnetic air showers we take into account the following interaction processes  the bremsstrahlung and the ionization losses for electrons and positrons ; the pair production and the compton scattering for photons . the lpm effect @xcite is taken into account for the bremsstrahlung and the pair production processes . in addition , we take into consideration the interaction of ehe @xmath0-rays with the geomagnetic field .",
    "the cross - sections of magnetic cascade processes ( the pair production and the synchrotron radiation ) are calculated in accordance with @xcite .",
    "we calculate the spatial distribution of the gmf within the framework of the dipolar central model ( dcm ; see e.g. @xcite ) . in table  1",
    "we present the gmf for two proposed sites of the auger observatory in northern and southern hemispheres @xcite . besides the dcm results we present in table  1 the strengths of gmf obtained in ref.@xcite by use of the data of the international geomagnetic reference field @xcite .",
    "one can see that the dipolar central model overestimates significantly the @xmath18-field at the southern hemisphere site .",
    "therefore in calculations we multiply the dcm results on @xmath18 by special correction factors providing the coincidence with data of @xcite near the earth surface . with such a correction the field strength for the northern hemisphere site of the auger observatory is larger by a factor of @xmath19 compared with the southern hemisphere site ( table  1 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath23 in figure  1 is the distance between the earth surface and the observation point measured along the air shower arrival direction .",
    "one can see that @xmath24 increases with the zenith angle @xmath25 and decreases rapidly as a function of distance @xmath23 .    for calculations of basic characteristics of photonuclear interactions of @xmath0-rays we performed special simulations with use of the sophia generator @xcite .",
    "this generator provides a comprehensive tool for simulations of photohadronic processes .",
    "in particular , this code includes the excitation and decay of baryon resonances , the direct production of pions and the multiple production of hadrons . to simplify the calculation technique we assumed that all unstable particles generated in the photoproduction process ( except for muons ) immediately decay at the point of their generation , i.e. we neglect the finiteness of life time of such particles .",
    "gev . ] in this approximation all secondary muons are assumed to be emitted at the point of the primary @xmath0-ray interaction .",
    "thus , the inclusive differential ( over the muon kinetic energy ( @xmath26 ) and the muon emission angle ( @xmath27 ) ) cross - section @xmath28 becomes the only input parameter .",
    "this cross - section is normalized as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total cross - section of photoproduction , @xmath31  the mean multiplicity of muons .",
    "following to recommendations of @xcite we define the quantity @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total cross - section of @xmath0-ray - proton interaction ( we use for this quantity data from @xcite ) , @xmath35 is the mean atomic number of air nuclei .    besides the electromagnetic cascades we have calculated also the characteristics of proton - induced showers . a standard quark - gluon - string ( qgs ) model is applied in this case to describe the hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented below are obtained with the help of numerical solution of the adjoint cascade equations . in this section",
    "we describe shortly the main features of these equations .",
    "let us consider as an example the system of adjoint equations that describe the longitudinal development of the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "studying the longitudinal development of such a cascade one can neglect the lateral displacement of secondary particles and their angular distribution induced mainly by the multiple coulomb scattering .",

    "the function @xmath70 is the probability of the muon to escape from the circle due to the multiple ( coulomb ) scattering .",
    "we calculate this function using the expression for the probability distribution function of muon lateral displacements based on the solution of a special kind of the adjoint transport equation obtained by @xcite .    for solution of adjoint cascade equations we use a numerical method",

    "the difference in the gmf strength between northern and southern site locations ( see table  1 and figure  1 ) does not affect considerably the shower profile as well . in this regard , an effective separation of @xmath0-ray and",
    "proton - induced showers on the basis of the shower profiles seems to be hard .",
    "perhaps such a separation could be achieved exploiting differences in the intrinsic fluctuations of the fluorescent light intensity , because the fluctuations in electromagnetic showers are smaller than in the hadronic ones ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the electromagnetic showers in the `` photon bunch '' regime caused by the gmf effect lead to an additional reduction of intrinsic fluctuations and , therefore , may improve the @xmath0-ray separation efficiency .",
    "no detailed studies have been done until now on the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) of muons in electromagnetic ehe air showers . recently , capdevielle et al .",
    "@xcite published ldf of muons using the corsika code and taking into account the lpm effect .",
    "however , they ignored the effect of interactions of @xmath0-rays with gmf , which significantly reduces the applicability of these results .",
    "moreover , the `` thinning technique '' used by these authors does not provide an acceptable accuracy of calculations for the ldf of muons .",
    "the thinning technique has been introduced by hillas @xcite .",
    "it allows a `` complete '' simulation only for a high energy part of the cascade which contains secondary particles with energy larger than a fixed threshold value @xmath140 . for low energy interactions , i.e. in the energy region @xmath141 , an artificial absorption of secondary particles",
    "is introduced .",
    "it is assumed that only one secondary particle survives in each interaction . for compensation of this `` disappearance '' of particles one should introduce appropriate statistical weights .",
    "to avoid large fluctuations of these weights ( dramatically worsening the accuracy of calculations ) , it is necessary to keep the thinning parameter @xmath142 to be sufficiently small ( @xmath40 is the energy of the primary particle ) .",
    "the computational time needed for simulation of one air shower by this technique is approximately proportional to @xmath143 .",
    "the simulations of @xcite include the ldf of photoproduced muons for 10 individual @xmath0-ray induced air showers with primary energy @xmath8  ev .",
    "these results correspond to the value of thinning parameter @xmath144 . for such value of @xmath68",
    "one needs approximately one hour of the computational time of 500  mhz ibm pc to simulate one air shower @xcite .",
    "it is seen from figure  7 of ref .",
    "@xcite that fluctuations caused by introduction of statistical weights are extremely large ( up to a factor of 30 ) . therefore to provide an acceptably small statistical error ( for example , 10% ) one has to simulate an extremely large ( up to @xmath145 ) number of air showers .",
    "correspondingly , this requires a great deal of the computational time . for comparison ,",
    "the calculation of ldf of photoproduced muons based on the numerical solution of adjoint cascade equations is not laborious and requires less than 1 hour of the computational time .",
    "besides , this method gives a set of ldf in an arbitrary energy region of primaries just for _ one run _ of calculations .",
    "note also that this method does not contain , by definition , statistical error at all .    in figures  15 , 16 we present the normalized ldf of muons of all energies , i.e. with kinetic energy @xmath146 .",
    "we define this parameter as @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the density of the muon flux at distance @xmath149 from the shower axis .",
    "results of figure  15 correspond to different assumptions about the gmf and the lpm effects , whereas figure  16 illustrates dependence of the ldf shape on the primary energy .",
    "it is seen that the geomagnetic field only slightly modifies the ldf shape .",
    "the interaction of @xmath0-rays with the gmf makes the ldf shape insensitive to the lpm effect . also , the ldf only slightly depends on the primary energy ( see figure  16 ) .",
    "for example , an increase of @xmath96 by a factor of 10 changes the ldf no more than @xmath13120% . on the contrary , at the absence of gmf the lpm effect would steepen considerably the shape of ldf , and make it strongly dependent on the primary energy ( figure  15 ) .    in figure  17",
    "we present the muon density for vertical proton and @xmath0-ray induced showers .",
    "we compare in this figure our results for primary @xmath0-ray with the results for primary protons obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by simulations with corsika .",
    "one can see that the @xmath0-induced shower provides an essentially narrower lateral distribution of muons compared with the proton shower . as a result",
    ", the ratio @xmath150 decreases rapidly with a growth of the radius ( from @xmath151 at @xmath152  m to @xmath153 at @xmath154  m ) .",
    "this feature of @xmath155 can provide an effective separation of @xmath0-induced air showers by the auger observatory , for which the distance from the core of the shower to the most of triggered detectors is very large , several hundred meters or more .    in figure  18",
    "we illustrate dependence of muon ldf on the arrival direction of the shower .",
    "one can see that the width of the ldf increases rapidly with a growth of the zenith angle @xmath25 .",
    "this feature of ldf provides a significant contribution of the photoproduced muons to the total number of charged particles at large distances from the shower core .",
    "this effect of inclined showers is demonstrated in figure  19 , where we present the particle density for two kinds of secondaries - muons and electrons . in our case",
    "the total number of muons at the observation level is much smaller than the total number of electrons ( @xmath156 ; see figure  9 ) . at the same time , at distances @xmath157  m from the core of the shower inclined at @xmath158 , the muon density @xmath159 exceeds considerably the electron density @xmath160 .",
    "this effect may have a non - negligible impact on the estimates of the primary energy of inclined electromagnetic showers detected by air shower arrays not identifying the origin of secondary charged particles . at the same time , for the auger observatory allowing identification of secondary particles , the detection of unusually high @xmath161 ratio in inclined showers at large distances from the shower core should not be _ a priori _ accepted as hadronic showers .",
    "the technique of adjoint cascade equations has been applied to study the characteristics of air showers created by ehe @xmath0-rays such as the total numbers of cascade electrons and photoproduced muons at the observation level , the longitudinal and lateral distributions of electrons and muons .",
    "both the lpm effect and interactions of primary @xmath0-rays with the geomagnetic field have been incorporated in the computational code .",
    "the lpm effect changes dramatically the energy dependence of the muon content @xmath81 . due to this effect",
    "the growth of @xmath81 with energy gradually disappears producing a local maximum around @xmath162  ev , after which @xmath81 decreases with @xmath96 .",
    "the interactions of @xmath0-rays with gmf which start to `` operate '' almost simultaneously with the lpm effect ( i.e. at @xmath163 ) recover the nominal energy dependence of @xmath81 `` switching off '' the lpm effect .",
    "the ratio of muon contents in the @xmath0-ray and proton induced showers ranges between @xmath164 in the ehe energy region , but decreases significantly at lower energies .",
    "the energy dependence of this quantity has a rather complicated ( non power - law ) form .    due to the combination of lpm and gmf effects the cascade curves of electrons in @xmath0-ray induced showers are quite similar to these curves for the proton - induced showers .",
    "this makes unfortunately rather difficult the separation of @xmath0-induced air showers on the basis of the temporal profiles of the fluorescent light by the fly s eye type detectors , except a narrow primary energy band ( around @xmath165 ) and a specific region of arrival directions ( depending on the detector location site ) for which @xmath0-rays freely pass through the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "the effect of lpm , when combined with interactions of @xmath0-rays with the gmf , on the lateral distribution of photoproduced muons is quite small .",
    "the @xmath0-induced air shower has an essentially narrower lateral distribution of muons compared with the proton shower .",
    "this feature can be effectively used for separation of @xmath0-ray induced air showers by the particle detectors of the auger observatory .",
    "the extension of the muon ldf increases considerably with the zenith angle of arriving primary @xmath0-rays .",
    "this results in an interesting effect - the density of muons at large distances from the shower core ( @xmath4  m ) may noticeably exceed the electron density .",
    "we are grateful to v.sahakian for valuable discussions .",
