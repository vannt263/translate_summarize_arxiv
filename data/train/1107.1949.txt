    "faraday waves , which typically refer to complex patterns of standing waves on a fluid surface in an oscillating container , are among the classical problems of fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has been a representative example of parametric instabilities @xcite . as is often the case with fluid mechanics , even classical phenomena are often not well understood in nonlinear regimes . indeed ,",
    "continuing experiments on faraday waves beyond the linear regimes reveal intriguing new features , which include snake - like structures in drop - confined faraday waves @xcite , a turbulent state mediated by defects of the pattern @xcite and so - called oscillons @xcite .    these surprising findings would probably be outside of the applicable range of the weakly nonlinear theories , such as the one developed by @xcite , on selection of various patterns of faraday waves .",
    "hence , to understand these phenomena , fully nonlinear numerical simulations of the faraday systems , which can be complementary to laboratory experiments , play an indispensable role as discussed in @xcite .",
    "perhaps the first such simulation , in which the motions of both the top and bottom fluids are simultaneously simulated , was performed recently by @xcite .",
    "this motivates our present study .    in these fully nonlinear simulations ,",
    "the inevitable difficulties are how to represent numerically the interface between the two immiscible fluids , how to follow its motion and how to calculate its influence on the bulk fluids . in @xcite",
    ", the interface is modelled by triangular elements whose apices are advected vertically and data on the interface elements are copied to the eulerian grids in the bulk of the fluids according to the recipe of the immersed boundary method @xcite . since numerical modelling of the interface involves various assumptions , its validation is required against laboratory experimental data or other data independent of the modelling . in the linear regime ,",
    "the analytical result of the linear theory of faraday waves due to @xcite provides reliable data for comparison , as used in @xcite . in nonlinear regimes ,",
    "comparison with experimental data is crucial .",
    "remarkably , the simulation result by @xcite is in perfect agreement with the experimental data in the nonlinear regime conducted by @xcite , where the top fluid s motion can not be neglected .",
    "the further task of such validated numerical simulations is to investigate data not easily accessible in experiments , such as nonlinear energy transfers between modes . for this purpose , in our opinion , it is important to have at least two validated numerical simulations with independent interface modelling and make sure that these simulations give consistent results .",
    "the aim of this study is to develop another nonlinear simulation method of faraday waves with an alternative interface model to that devised by @xcite .",
    "we here apply to the faraday wave problem the phase - field modelling with the cahn - hilliard equation for binary fluids @xcite .",
    "the phase - field method , like front - tracking methods , volume - of - fluid methods and level - set methods , easily allows situations where the interface becomes a multivalued function of the horizontal coordinates .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for recent application of the phase - field method to rayleigh - taylor instability and to other flows in the references therein . to our knowledge , the method hat not been applied to the faraday wave problem .",
    "in this paper we focus on faraday waves in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) to explore the capabilities of the phase - field method in a simple setting .",
    "earlier numerical studies of 2d faraday waves include @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where the fluid dynamical equations for the bottom fluid are solved but the top fluid s motion is neglected in contrast to the present simulation . another numerical approach using different formalisms ( the boundary integral and the vortex sheet ) is explored by @xcite .",
    "here we proceed as follows . in the linear regime",
    ", we compare quantitatively the phase - field simulation with the linear theory by @xcite for validation as in @xcite . in the nonlinear regime , unfortunately suitable experimental data in 2d for comparison with our simulation are not available .",
    "however , we qualitatively make comparison with the simulation of 2d faraday waves with the vortex - sheet formulation by @xcite in the regime of plume formation , where the interface becomes a multivalued function . finally , we present simulation results concerning the period tripling state , where the oscillation period of the faraday waves becomes three times the basic period .",
    "this state is found experimentally by @xcite in quasi - two dimensional faraday waves , by @xcite in axisymmetric three - dimensional faraday waves , and numerically also by @xcite .",
    "its underlying physics is not yet understood .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in  2 , we describe the basic fluid dynamical the equations and our phase - field model of the faraday waves .",
    "our numerical method for solving the equations is explained in  2 .",
    "we then make a quantitative comparison of its simulation results with the linear analysis in  3 . in",
    " 4 , we present results of the phase - field simulation in nonlinear regimes .",
    "the first simulation shows plume formation , in which the interface overturns . the second one concerns the period tripling state .",
    "concluding remarks are made in the last  5 .",

    "however , we do not follow the motion until the ejection or pinchoff occurs .",
    "the second case is the period tripling state of the two - dimensional faraday waves .",
    "plume formation of the faraday interfaces in two dimensions was studied numerically by @xcite using the vortex - sheet method , with which we compare the phase - field simulation .",
    "the presence of a plume implies that the interface profile becomes a multivalued function of the horizontal coordinate .",
    "such situations can be numerically handled by the phase - field method without _ ad hoc _ adjustments .",
    "here the comparison is qualitative .",
    "there are three reasons for this : the difference in atwood number @xmath150 , the difference in the boundary conditions , and with or without viscosity .",
    "regarding the atwood number difference , the phase - field method with the discretization described in section [ ss : nm ] is not able to handle high atwood number @xmath151 .",

    "concerning the difference in the boundary conditions , there is no rigid boundary in the vertical direction in their vortex - sheet calculation .",
    "however , in our case fluids are contained between two rigid walls .",
    "the third reason is that the vortex - sheet calculation is inviscid , while the phase - field method is viscous .    in @xcite",
    ", the overturning interface corresponding to formation of a plume at @xmath153 and @xmath143 is numerically studied .",
    "we observe a similar overturning behaviour in the phase - field simulation even at as low as @xmath154 , which we show in figure [ f : ot ] .",
    "the parameters of the phase simulation are : @xmath155 @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the force @xmath9 in ( [ ns ] ) is here @xmath158 , oscillating around zero .",
    "the initial interface is given by ( [ e : tanh ] ) with @xmath159 .",
    "the time step and the number of grid points are @xmath160 and @xmath161 . here",
    "we take the same parameters @xmath162 and the same vibration force @xmath9 setting ( oscillating around the origin ) as @xcite .",
    "the differences between our simulations and theirs are the atwood number , the vibration amplitude value ( ours are nine times larger ) , the presence of the top and bottom rigid walls and the presence of viscosity .    the time variation of the interface location at a fixed horizontal point is shown in figure [ f : ot](a ) .",
    "the interface location first exhibits a rise and then a fall ( here at about @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , where @xmath127 is the vibration period ) ; then it grows steeply ( at around @xmath165 ) and reaches a high plateau ( between @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) with a small oscillation .",
    "this variation is similar to that with @xmath153 obtained with the vortex - sheet method ( figure 11(a ) of @xcite ) . in our simulation ,",
    "the interface location later than @xmath168 ( continuation of figure[f : ot](a ) but not shown ) goes downwards and shows again a plateau with a small oscillation .",
    "then it goes upwards and finally comes back to zero around @xmath169 .",
    "this later variation can not be compared with the vortex - sheet method result of @xcite because their calculation is stopped before @xmath170 .",
    "the phase field @xmath25 at @xmath171 is shown in figure [ f : ot](b ) , which clearly shows that the interface turns over and becomes a multivalued function of the horizontal coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "qualitatively similar interface structures , called plumes , are shown in figure 11(b ) of @xcite . to check the boundary effect",
    ", we also do the phase - field simulation with aspect ratio 2 ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "the plume shape and its time evolution do not change qualitatively , indicating that the effect of the vertical boundary is small on the plume formation .",
    "this agreement suggests that the phase - field simulation is valid , at least qualitatively , in the overturning regime although it can not handle cases with high atwood number .    in figure",
    "[ f : ot](c ) and ( e ) , we plot the vorticity field @xmath173 at the plume state .",
    "indeed much of the vorticity concentrates inside the interface region .",
    "the vorticity along the interface in the right half domain has three peaks as seen in the contour plot of figure [ f : ot](e ) .",
    "in contrast , in the simulation of @xcite , the strength of the vortex sheet has at most two peaks in the developed plume state . in the phase - field simulation",
    "we observe that the vorticity outside of the interface reaches about 40% of the maximum vorticity in the interface region .",
    "in addition , thin vortex layers are attached near the top and bottom walls . in these layers ,",
    "the vorticity is about 10% of the maximum in the interface region .",
    "we now comment on the choice of the resolution @xmath174 used here .",
    "we observe that the squared modulus of the fourier coefficients @xmath175 decreases exponentially for large @xmath108 such as @xmath176 $ ] .",

    "we take the smallest @xmath41 in powers of 2 satisfying this relation .",

    "it is not clear to us for the present whether or not we can overcome these problems by improving the temporal and spatial discretizations of the cahn - hilliard and navier - stokes equations .    finally , we comment on extension of the phase - field method to three - dimensional faraday waves .",
    "it is straightforward .",
    "we believe that the three - dimensional phase - field method , once extended , can be complementary to the simulation method by @xcite since the two methods are different .",
