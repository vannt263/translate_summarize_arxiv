    "the statistical mechanical background is explained in full detail in section [ sec : models ] .",
    "it is tempting to try and find a simple combinatorial interpretation that explains the cancellations in a direct way .",
    "this was posed as a challenge in the paper of ducharme , labelle and leroux @xcite . in the connected graph cases ,",
    "this was done by bernardi @xcite .",
    "the approach was to use an involution that exhibits the result of the almost perfect cancellation as a contribution from the fixed points of the involution .",
    "the fixed points were identified as increasing trees in the discrete case and rooted trees in the continuum case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present similar derivations for the two - connected graph cases . as",
    "always this is considerably more complicated .",
    "the concept of using an involution to understand the cancellations is natural .",
    "recall the formula that , for any finite non - empty set @xmath18 , we have : _ s x(-1)^|s|=0 . in order to prove this , we show we have the same number of sets with even cardinality as we do of odd cardinality .",
    "one approach is to pair sets differing by one element .",
    "this pairing idea is captured by the involution . in this example , the involution is defined by first fixing a singleton subset of @xmath18 , say @xmath19 , and taking the symmetric difference @xmath20 .",
    "if we consider a fixed vertex set @xmath5 $ ] for a graph , then a graph @xmath4 is determined precisely by its edge set @xmath21 , which are subsets of the collection of unordered pairs in @xmath5 $ ] , denoted @xmath5^{(2)}$ ] .",
    "we can also use this symmetric difference operation on the edge set for graphs .",
    "an important complication is that we consider particular subsets for which taking the symmetric difference with a fixed edge will not suffice , since the removal or addition of the edge may take us outside of the prescribed collection of subsets .",
    "we need to find an efficient way of choosing an edge based on the graph we are considering so that we obtain a pairing that will not take us outside of the prescribed collection .    in section [ sec",
    ": results ] , we present the combinatorial structures that give the interpretations of the cancellations in the two - connected case",
    ". sections [ sec:1phcinv ] and [ sec : chcginv ] give the proofs of the one particle hard core and the tonks gas case respectively . in the latter , the decomposition of polytopes into unimodular simplices attributed to lass is given so that it may be proved as an extension of the previous case .",
    "we provide an interpretation why @xmath22 should appear as the number of edges in section [ sec : structure ] .    from the perspective of statistical mechanics ,",
    "the motivation for understanding such cancellations is to be able to adapt the understanding to models where more complicated weights are used .",
    "indeed , the key idea is to emulate what is done for the connections between connected graphs and trees and understand how to modify these in this context .",
    "the first parallel to draw is that the involution of bernardi fits within a general concept of externally and internally active elements of a set with a matroid structure as given by bjrner and sokal @xcite .",
    "the idea to emphasise here is that this allows the set of connected graphs to be partitioned into subsets , indexed by trees .",
    "when we consider graphs with the partial order defined by bond inclusion , the blocks in this partition are boolean .",
    "that is , each set has a tree @xmath23 as minimal graph and a corresponding maximal graph @xmath24 , all graphs with edge set @xmath25 such that @xmath26 are included in the set in the partition .",
    "this form of a partition lends itself well to performing estimates on the cluster coefficients .",
    "this was actually realised earlier by penrose @xcite in the specific case of connected graphs .",
    "understanding this partition into boolean subsets also gives rise to an alternative involution .",
    "it is intriguing to realise that the general construction does not include the penrose construction as a subcase .",
    "these ideas are addressed in section [ sec : extend ] .",
    "this combinatorial understanding is also closely linked to the tree - graph identities of brydges battle and federbush @xcite , for which a symmetric version is provided by abdesselam and rivasseau @xcite and a matroid generalisation by faris @xcite .",
    "these identities allow estimations to be made on these coefficients , since we may express the sum over connected graphs as a sum over trees with modified weights .",
    "a greater goal is to extend these to partially ordered sets where a matroid structure may not be present .",
    "interest in providing such bounds on the virial expansion coefficients has recently been renewed with the papers by pulvirenti and tsagkarogiannis @xcite and morais and procacci @xcite , which use the canonical ensemble as a method of achieving bounds .",
    "the paper by jansen @xcite suggests that at high temperatures the radius of convergence should be improved : actual improvements on the bounds of lebowitz and penrose @xcite have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "in a classical gas system of @xmath0 indistinguishable interacting particles in a vessel @xmath27 with only two - body interactions and no external potential , we may write the hamiltonian as : h(,)=_i=1^n + _ 1 i < j n(q_i , q_j ) , where @xmath28 represents the generalised coordinates and @xmath29 the conjugate momenta .",
    "the canonical partition function of the gas model is : z(,,n)=_i=1^n ( _ ^dq_i _ ^d",
    "^dp_i ) ( - h ) . integrating out the gaussian integrals for the momenta , we obtain a factor @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the thermal wavelength .",

    "this is defined through the shortest path from @xmath49 to @xmath119 .",
    "we indicate that for any path between @xmath49 and @xmath119 containing the edge @xmath114 we can find a path of the same or shorter length that does not contain this edge .",
    "if @xmath343 , then considering a path from @xmath49 to @xmath119 up to this edge , we realise that the shortest length the path up to this edge can be is @xmath344 , but we know that there is a shorter path to this endpoint because @xmath343 and so we can replace this initial path with a shorter path .",
    "we are left with the case @xmath345 .",
    "we know from property @xmath346 that there is some @xmath315 such that @xmath336 and @xmath347 is an edge in both graphs .",
    "therefore if the initial segment of a path includes the edge @xmath114 , then the shortest this can be is @xmath348 .",

    "we know that we have a path of length @xmath349 to @xmath315 on which we can attach the edge @xmath350 to construct a new path of the same length but not using this edge .",
    "we now have that condition @xmath351 for penrose active edges is the same in both graphs , since the graph distance is the same .",
    "we now indicate that an edge satisfies condition @xmath346 independent of the presence of @xmath114 .",
    "we realise if @xmath114 was added or removed satisfying @xmath351 then it has no effect on an edge satisfying @xmath346 , since @xmath346 depends on edges between generations . therefore",
    ", we consider that @xmath114 satisfies @xmath346 . since @xmath333",
    ", we have an @xmath322 such that @xmath347 is an edge in both graphs and @xmath336 .",
    "this means that if we use @xmath115 to invoke applying condition @xmath346 for an edge to be penrose active , then we can invoke it in both cases by using @xmath315 .",
    "we can also go the other way and find a bernardi construction to provide an appropriate partition .",
    "the map @xmath309 \\to \\mathcal{c}[n]$ ] , which adds to @xmath23 all externally active edges for the given tree graph @xmath23 is the appropriate partition scheme .",
    "this is explained in the context of matroids below .    in the work of bjrner and sokal @xcite",
    ", it is explained that for a matroid @xmath352 , where we give a total order to the underlying set @xmath353 , we may find a partition of the collection of subsets of @xmath354 according to the matroid structure .",
    "we introduce below some key definitions for matroids to introduce this connection , which can be found in the book of oxley @xcite and the work of faris @xcite .",
    "a matroid @xmath352 on the ground set @xmath355 is defined by a collection of independent subsets , denoted @xmath356 .",
    "these subsets must satisfy the following three axioms :    1 .",
    "@xmath357 ( non empty ) 2 .",
    "if @xmath358 and @xmath359 then @xmath360 ( downward closed ) 3 .",
    "if @xmath358 and @xmath361 and @xmath362 , then there exists @xmath363 with @xmath364 ( augmentation property )    for a graphical matroid , the ground set is @xmath5^{(2)}$ ] .",
    "we define the independent sets as forests or acyclic graphs .",
    "a maximal independent set @xmath365 is called a basis .",
    "the set of bases is denoted @xmath366 .",
    "the maximal independent sets for a graphical matroid are therefore trees .    the rank of a matroid @xmath352 , @xmath367 is the cardinality of a basis element .",
    "all bases have the same cardinality and so the rank is well defined .",
    "a matroid can be defined by its set of bases , since @xmath368 if and only if @xmath369 , for some @xmath370 .    given a matroid , @xmath352 , consider @xmath371 .",
    "there is a matroid @xmath372 , which is the restriction of @xmath352 to @xmath18 .",
    "it has ground set @xmath18 and @xmath373 .    for @xmath371 ,",
    "the rank of @xmath18 , @xmath374 is the rank of the matroid @xmath372 or alternatively the cardinality of the largest independent subset of @xmath18 .",
    "we note that @xmath375 if and only if @xmath18 is independent , so the rank function completely determines the matroid .",
    "the dual of a matroid is defined on the same ground set , but has a dual rank function rk@xmath376 , defined by : ^(a):=|a|-(e)+(e a )    let @xmath12 be the set of bases for @xmath25 .",
    "the dual basis set is then @xmath377 .",
    "we fix a total order on @xmath25 in the following .",
    "let @xmath378 .",
    "an element @xmath379 is _ externally active _ on @xmath277 if @xmath85 is dependent on the list of elements of @xmath277 larger than it .",
    "we let @xmath380 be the set of externally active elements .",
    "an element @xmath381 is _ internally active _ on @xmath277 , if in the dual matroid @xmath85 is externally active on the complement @xmath382 .",
    "we denote by @xmath383 the set of internally active elements .    for @xmath384 , we define @xmath385=\\{a \\vert r \\subseteq a \\subseteq s\\}$ ] .",
    "@xmath386 can be written as the disjoint union : 2^e=_b [ b(b),b ( b ) ] [ eq : c1 ] .",
    "for the case of the graphical matroid , we recall that the bases are the collection of trees .",
    "if we use the lexicographical order on the edges , then an edge is externally active for a tree @xmath23 in this sense , if and only if it is externally active in the sense of bernardi @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that all independent sets are forests and so a set of edges is dependent if it creates a cycle .",
    "we emphasise that for connected graphs , internally active edges play no role , since trees are minimally connected graphs .",
    "this therefore gives , when we intersect each set with connected graphs :    [ n]=_[n ] [ , r ( ) ] , where @xmath24 has edge set @xmath387 .",
    "we note that the penrose construction does not fit in the construction given above . in figure",
    "[ fig : penrosenoorder ] , we see that we would add the dashed edge in each case . in order to do this",
    ", we can not have a consistent ordering on the edges @xmath388 , @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "the motivation of emphasising this connection is to understand if a similar connection may be drawn for two - connected graphs as the important context of the result .",
    "the main conclusion is that we are able to identify combinatorially the cancellations in the alternating sums of weighted two - connected graphs .",
    "the combinatorial factor arises from increasing trees on the subset @xmath60 $ ] of the vertices , with the vertex @xmath0 adjacent to every other vertex .",
    "there are modified versions for this in the case of the polytope , where we have the isomorphic graph structures , differing only through a relabelling in the form @xmath391 for all @xmath392 $ ] .",
    "the key outlook for the work contained in this paper is to modify the set up explained in section [ sec : extend ] towards two - connected graphs so that we obtain a helpful resummation of the graphs amenable to suitable estimation , which is important for the virial expansion .",
    "the parallel that is useful to draw here is that for the cluster expansion , we have the increasing and cayley trees as the combinatorial objects representing the two cases above .",
