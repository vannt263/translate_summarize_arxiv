    "so we can define hyperelliptic simplified broken lefschetz fibrations as a generalization of hyperelliptic lefschetz fibrations .",
    "hyperelliptic lefschetz fibrations have been studied in many fields , algebraic geometry and topology for example , and it has been shown that the total spaces of such fibrations satisfy strong conditions on the signature , the euler characteristic and so on ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "auroux , donaldson and katzarkov @xcite showed that a closed oriented four - manifold @xmath16 admits a near - symplectic form if and only if @xmath16 admits a broken lefschetz pencil ( or fibration ) @xmath5 which has a cohomology class @xmath20 such that @xmath21 for every connected component of every fiber of @xmath5 .",

    "a kirby diagram of @xmath705 is shown in figure [ kirby2 ] , where the framing of the @xmath31-handles drawn in the bold curves is @xmath23 , the framing of the @xmath31-handle of @xmath713 is described by the broken curve and the framings of the other @xmath31-handles are all @xmath186 .",
