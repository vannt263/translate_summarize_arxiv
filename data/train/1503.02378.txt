    "femtosecond laser optics has been widely used , during the last two decades , as a time - resolving spectroscopic means in studying ultrafast time - scale dynamics of variety of quantum systems including atoms , molecules , quasi - particles in solids , etc  @xcite .",
    "extreme peak intensity of femtosecond laser pulses has also enabled high - order nonlinear optical processes such as multi - photon excitations , high - harmonic generations , and above - threshold ionizations , to list a few  @xcite .",
    "besides these usages , coherent control  @xcite , the technique of using laser pulse shapes to steer quantum processes towards certain desirable outcomes , has gradually become another important use of femtosecond laser and the information of such laser pulse shapes as obtained through coherent control often plays a crucial role in understanding the quantum structure of the materials under consideration  @xcite . in that regards , people can furthermore analytically design the laser pulse shapes optimized , although limited to a few quantum systems , for more selective and efficient nonlinear optical processes  @xcite .",
    "the recent demonstration  @xcite that a counter - propagating pair of ultrafast laser pulses coherently induces doppler - free two - photon transitions of atoms shows an intriguing possibility towards ultra - precision spectroscopy  @xcite , especially when being used in conjunction with the femtosecond frequency comb  @xcite .",
    "this method , termed as spatial coherent control , coherently arranges in time the spectral components of the laser pulse in such a way that all the counter - propagating photon pairs , energy - resonant to the atomic transition ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 ) , collide only at specific locations along the beam direction .",
    "since the resonance condition varies from one atom species to the another , the atom - specific spectroscopic information can be retrieved by imaging the distinct , if a proper coherent control scheme is used , spatial excitation profile .",
    "so far , this powerful method of spatial coherent control has been applied being limited to non - resonant two - photon transitions ( or to the cases in which intermediate states are not directly involved with the transition ) and yet to resonant two - photon transitions ( two - photon transitions with a resonant intermediate state or states ) .",
    "however , there already exist sophisticated pulse - shaping methods  @xcite to deal with the latter case , the resonant two - photon transitions , in the context of optimized single - pulse controls toward enhanced two - photon transitions .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an experimental demonstration of the spatial coherent control of the resonant two - photon transition 5s@xmath1 5p@xmath2 5d of atomic rubidium ( @xmath3rb ) .",
    "ultrashort laser pulses are programmed in such a way that not only ( 1 ) counter - propagating photon pairs , and no photon pairs in the same propagation direction , induce the given transition , but also ( 2 ) the contributions from the all possible combinations of photon energies , involving such transition , are coherently added for an optimal net transition probability . for this , we first adopt spectral pulse shaping methods : @xmath4-shape spectral phase programming for the condition ( 1 ) ; and either a spectral phase - step or a spectral phase - window for ( 2 ) in the first and second experiments , respectively . in the remaining sections , we first theoretically sketch the laser pulse shaping ideas relevant for the resonant and non - resonant two - photon transitions , respectively , in sec .",
