    "with the recent development in microcalorimetry experiments under extreme conditions [ very low temperature ( @xmath3 ) , high pressure ( @xmath4 ) or strong magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) ] @xcite a new period starts in heavy fermion physics with the possibility of a precise determination of the boundaries between different phases .",
    "the first example is given by the recent experiments performed on the heavy fermion compound cerhin@xmath0 in los alamos @xcite as well as in grenoble @xcite ; it leads to state more precisely the interplay between antiferromagnetism ( af ) and superconductivity ( sc ) .",
    "the spectacular effect is the re - entrance of af under magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) inside the sc phase .",
    "the second example discussed will be uru@xmath1si@xmath1 ; the long standing debate is the duality between the low pressure ( @xmath6  gpa ) hidden order ( ho ) phase and the switch to a large moment antiferromagnetism ( lmaf ) @xcite .",
    "recent microcalorimetric measurements up to 12  gpa reveal the coexistence of lmaf and a spin density wave ( sdw ) above @xmath7 .",
    "the sdw may be the major component of the ho state below @xmath7 with the exclusion of lmaf since a drop in the carrier number coincides with the entrance in the ho phase .",
    "there are other interesting examples such as the interplay of the sc domain with the different ferromagnetic phases of uge@xmath1 @xcite and of urhge driven by pressure or magnetic field @xcite , or the collapse of the insulating phase ( i ) of smb@xmath8 or sms and the concomitant appearance of long range magnetism @xcite",
    ".    often , the interplay between af and another phase ( sc , sdw , or i ) , with a tuning parameter ( @xmath9 ) , leads not to a second order phase transition as assumed in the quantum - critical approach ( the nel temperature @xmath10 ) but via a first order transition .",
    "there are also situations like uru@xmath1si@xmath1 or uge@xmath1 where sc can disappear or survive under @xmath4 on crossing a first order line depending on the @xmath4 variation of the pairing potential @xcite .    in the two chosen examples of cerhin@xmath0 and uru@xmath1si@xmath1 ,",
    "a strong duality exist between the localized and itinerant character of the 4@xmath11 and 5@xmath11 electrons . an important part of the puzzle",
    "is the fermi surface ( fs ) topology ( see r. settai @xcite ) .",
    "a main difference between the two systems is that in cerhin@xmath0 the number of electron carriers @xmath12 is roughly comparable to the number of the magnetic sites while in uru@xmath1si@xmath1 a large decrease of the carrier number ( a factor of 3 or 10 ) is associated to the ordering temperature @xmath13 going from paramagnetic ( pm ) to the ho state .",
    "the discovery of the 115 cerium family has opened the possibility of a careful study of the interplay between af and sc . since the maxima of their nel temperature @xmath14 ( @xmath15  k ) and their superconducting temperature @xmath16 ( @xmath17  k ) are quite comparable as well as the size of their associated specific heat anomaly @xcite . figure [ fig-1 ] illustrates the data of ac microcalorimetry experiments under pressure on cerhin@xmath0 down to 0.6  k @xcite . below 1.5  gpa ,",
    "only af anomalies are detected ; from 1.5  gpa to @xmath18  gpa so far @xmath19 , on cooling below @xmath14 a broad sc specific heat anomaly is detected at @xmath20 with @xmath20 rapidly increasing under pressure .",
    "however , the detection of the diamagnetic sc shielding by ac susceptibility gives another value of @xmath16 , @xmath21 .",
    "clearly the onset of sc appears quite inhomogeneous or at least quite different from the classical bcs prediction .",
    "the recollection of resistivity ( @xmath22 ) , susceptibility ( @xmath23 ) , and specific heat ( @xmath24 ) data gives the sequence @xmath25 in the respective @xmath16 determination .",
    "recently it was claimed only on the basis of ac susceptibility measurements that even at @xmath26 cerhin@xmath0 may present a coexistence of sc and af with @xmath27  mk and a superconducting critical field @xmath28 at @xmath29 near 500  oe @xcite .",
    "this conclusion deserves careful verifications as lattice imperfections may lead to superconducting behavior not directly related with sc bulk nature unambiguously detected by ac calorimetric experiments .",
    "by contrast in microscopic nqr measurements , the af - sc matter below @xmath30 appears homogeneous with a single relaxation process and a well characterized af pattern . however , sc is mainly gapless @xcite . by comparison to ordinary systems showing the coexistence of af and sc as the borocarbide or chevrel phases with quite different electronic baths involved in af ( localized spin ) and in sc ( light itinerant electron )",
    ", the first novelty of heavy fermion superconductors is that , in zero order , the same electrons are involved in the magnetic and sc properties . the usual statement that sc will not modify af even for @xmath31",
    "is clearly precluded @xcite .",
    "the second novelty is that the magnetic coherence length @xmath32 can reach a nanometric scale , far higher than the atomic distance observed in classical af , due to the proximity of the so - called quantum critical point ( qcp ) ; even @xmath32 may become comparable to the superconducting coherence length @xmath33 .    obviously above @xmath18  gpa",
    "when @xmath34 becomes higher than @xmath35 , af disappears suddenly at least down to the lowest measurement temperature ( @xmath36  k ) .",
    "the usual molecular field shape of the sc specific heat anomaly is recovered and there is a perfect coincidence between @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the size of the sc anomaly @xmath38 at @xmath16 as a function of @xmath4 goes through a maximum around @xmath39  gpa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) . extrapolating from cecoin@xmath0 behavior @xcite ,",
    "this extremum is a signature of the enhancement of the effective mass : the increase of @xmath38 at @xmath16 near @xmath40 is associated to the fact that the fermi liquid is far to be established at @xmath40 so the extrapolation of @xmath41 in the normal phase down to @xmath42 will be quite higher than the value of @xmath41 just above @xmath16 .",
    "direct evidences of an increase of the effective mass above @xmath30 come from dhva experiments @xcite . in these high field experiments ( @xmath43  t )",
    ", it is also claimed that the fermi surface changes at @xmath44 supporting the idea that the qcp may be associated with a localization - delocalization transition of the 4@xmath11 electron .",
    "however , the sc properties in low field do not support a discontinuous change of the fs at @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we think the strong non - symmetric increase of the effective mass on both sides of @xmath40 reported in the dhva experiments reflects mainly the transition from af ordered state to pm state ( see below ) .",
    "the link between a change in dhva frequencies and localization of the 4@xmath11 electron is not so obvious . in the well documented case of ceru@xmath1si@xmath1 @xcite , a change in the itinerancy of the 4@xmath11 electrons under magnetic field at its pseudo - metamagnetic field @xmath45",
    "t is unlikely to occur ; the high magnetic polarization of the band may lead to a reconstructing of the fs @xcite .",
    "the directly following questions is if the fs at @xmath46 may not vary at @xmath30 when af disappears quasi - discontinuously .    above @xmath30 ,",
    "also a clear change is found in nqr properties ; the nuclear relaxation rate @xmath47 follows the well known @xmath48 law below @xmath16 characteristic of unconventional superconductivity with a line of zeros .",
    "new careful nqr experiments reported in this conference @xcite , suggests that the phase diagram is not as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] with a first order transition but there is a tetracritical point at @xmath30 with a clear coexistence of a homogeneous regime af+sc between the purely af and sc states as discussed in so(5 ) theory @xcite .",
    "of course , the next step is to observe at low temperature directly the end points ( quantum critical or first order ) @xmath49 and @xmath50 where the sc or af component of the af+sc phase collapse , respectively ; @xmath49 seems to be near 1.5  gpa , @xmath18  gpa with @xmath51 , and @xmath52  gpa .    in a simple picture",
    "there is a competing process between the af and the sc gap .",
    "if @xmath53 ( above @xmath30 ) , the sc gap is mainly opened on almost the entire @xmath54 space ( outside a restricted domain where a line of zeros may occur ) ; it precludes the further occurrence of af on cooling . on the other hand below @xmath30 ,",
    "a coexisting regime of af and sc can occur since here only a restricted @xmath54 space is involved by the occurrence of af ; however , af can only persist in the pressure range of gapless sc ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this interplay between magnetism and sc ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath5 can reveal new situations by modifying the nature of the interaction itself ( switching from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic @xcite ) or also by reversing the relative strength of @xmath14 versus @xmath16 . for the af cerhin@xmath0 ,",
    "the characteristic field @xmath55 of the af - pm boundary is very high at ambient pressure , near 50 t along the basal plane @xcite .",
    "without sc the nel temperature is suspected to collapse near @xmath40 and furthermore , from previous studies on heavy fermion compounds @xcite , it is believed that @xmath55 may not collapse linearly with pressure at @xmath40 but vanishes only rapidly for @xmath4 close to @xmath40 .",
    "as @xmath56  t at @xmath30 is quite lower than @xmath57 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 will decrease rapidly with @xmath5 while @xmath60 is almost field independent for @xmath61 . at a field @xmath62 when @xmath58 reaches @xmath60 , af is certainly recovered in the sc phase as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] . neglecting the vortices",
    ", the coexisting phase of af+sc under field will correspond to @xmath63 , i.e. defined by the @xmath64 curve @xmath63 and the horizontal line @xmath65 line .",
    "the interesting point is that the coexisting domain occurs far below @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] ) .",
    "this clearly proves that the vortex play an important role in the re - entrance of the antiferromagnetism under magnetic field . in the grenoble experiment ,",
    "no second transition can be observed for @xmath66  t , whatever is @xmath67 . in los",
    "alamos data af is detected from @xmath46 as @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that such a re - entrance of af is well explained in so(5 ) theory @xcite ; the magnetism originated from the vortex core can expand on the superconducting coherence length as basically @xmath32 is comparable to @xmath33 . on approaching @xmath40 , the coexisting domain shrinks toward @xmath28 .",
    "this suggests strongly that magnetism may play an important role in the emergence of a new low temperature  high magnetic field phase in cecoin@xmath0 @xcite when the field is applied in the basal plane ( see nmr contribution of @xcite and contradictory reports of refs . @xcite and @xcite ) . very recently",
    "the interplay of sc and af has been studied in ceco(in@xmath69cd@xmath70)@xmath0 @xcite with the confirmation that without sc cecoin@xmath0 will be near an af qcp and with also the observation that af and sc coexist for @xmath71 when @xmath14 is larger than @xmath16 but af collapses so far sc appears at a higher temperature than the expected value of @xmath14 for @xmath72 .",
    "now there are converging evidences of the duality between af and sc as well as the possibility of coexisting phases induced under pressure or magnetic field .",
    "the next step is to go further : microscopic informations on the nature of the order parameter in the different regimes ( notably on the incommensurability or commensurability of the af structure in the af and sc ) and the key role of the vortex matter have to be achieved",
    ".    one can speculate if in heavy fermion superconductors a second order qcp exist in the presence of sc @xcite .",
    "often , in cerium heavy fermion superconductors like cein@xmath73 , cerh@xmath1si@xmath1 , or cepd@xmath1si@xmath1 the maximum of @xmath14 is about ten times larger than that of @xmath16 ; thus the study of the af and sc boundaries is difficult .",
    "the repulsion between af and sc was one of the main results of cecu@xmath1si@xmath1 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite . in the calorimetric experiment on cepd@xmath1si@xmath1",
    "@xcite , no magnetic anomaly has been detected when @xmath31 as well as no superconducting anomaly when @xmath74 .",
    "however , for cerhin@xmath0 the maxima of @xmath14 and @xmath16 are of the same order of magnetitude , thus enlightening detailed experiments with fine tuning of pressure are possible . for the other cases very low temperatures",
    "are required which give rise to a lack of carefull measurements . in the case",
    "cerhin@xmath0 the very fast drop of @xmath14 at @xmath30 gives strong indications for a first order transition from an af+sc to a pure sc ground state in zero magnetic field .",
    "the application of a magnetic field yields to the re - entrance of magnetism and shifts the transition to higher pressures ; the re - entrance phase seems to collapse close to the critical pressure @xmath40 where @xmath14 would collapse in absence of sc .",
    "however , the appearance of sc hides this magnetically critical regime .",
    "the discovery in nagoya @xcite that a first order transition at @xmath75  gpa occurs in uru@xmath1si@xmath1 at low temperature between the hidden order ( ho ) phase and large moment antiferromagnetism ( lmaf ) leads us to revisit the phase diagram of uru@xmath1si@xmath1 as described in fig .  [ fig-6 ] .",
    "from previous works @xcite , the proposal is that the hidden order phase with an ordering temperature @xmath13 is switched to lmaf which may order at @xmath14 higher than @xmath13 at high pressure .",
    "the crossing of the @xmath76 and @xmath60 lines seems to occur for @xmath77  gpa .",
    "thus @xmath78 may be the end point of the @xmath79 dashed line .",
    "another interesting observation is the disappearance of sc near @xmath78 ; lmaf and sc are antagonist ( @xmath80 when the lmaf volume fraction @xmath81 ) .",
    "evidences of the new high pressure phase ( lmaf ) were first given in ref .",
    "@xcite with , however , the preliminary conclusion that the switch from ho to lmaf corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "further neutron scattering experiments performed under better hydrostatic pressure conditions clarified that the ho to lmaf transition at @xmath29  k coincides with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the ho phase is still under debate , notably on the intrinsic origin of the detected tiny sublattice magnetization @xmath83 at ambient pressure .",
    "nmr as well as @xmath84sr experiments @xcite favor the extrinsic origin @xcite with the underlying idea that pressure gradients near lattice imperfections may stabilize a tiny percentage of lmaf in the ho state .",
    "the complete disappearance of the lmaf phase ( fraction @xmath85 ) may occur only for a slightly negative pressure ( @xmath86  gpa ) while the ho phase may only disappear above ( @xmath87  gpa ) .",
    "however , a neutron scattering analysis supports an intrinsic origin of the magnetic moment in the ho state @xcite ; within this frame a phenomenological model was developed on the basis that the primary ho is a spin density wave which can drive an extra tiny moment on the u site @xcite .",
    "the relevance of nesting at @xmath13 was already clear two decades ago in uru@xmath1si@xmath1 @xcite ; confirmations were recently given by thermal transport measurements @xcite .",
    "furthermore it was stressed that this sdw may be described by a bcs approach . extrapolating to the previous cerhin@xmath0 description , when @xmath88 lmaf is excluded . to test the coexistence of sdw and lmaf under pressure ,",
    "new ac calorimetry experiments were performed up to 12  gpa .",
    "figures [ fig-7 ] and [ fig-8 ] represent the phase and inverse of the module of the measured thermoelectric signal , which is , in first order , proportional to the specific heat @xcite .",
    "[ fig-9 ] displays the high pressure phase diagram deduced from these measurements .",
    "the main result is that sdw survives inside the lmaf phase as found for cerhin@xmath0 for af and sc in a narrow pressure range . up to 1.1  gpa ,",
    "both ac calorimetric responses in phase and module reproduces the @xmath26 behavior . for @xmath89",
    "gpa , the signal slightly above @xmath13 becomes broadened as the second contribution slowly grows with @xmath4 . above 1.5  gpa",
    "two separated anomalies emerge .",
    "the high temperature one is assumed to be associated with the appearance of lmaf at @xmath14 ; the low temperature one seems to be the continuation of @xmath13 .    of course , at low temperature",
    "no specific heat anomaly can be detected along the @xmath90 line as the discontinuous changes are in the volume and sublattice magnetization . as pictured on fig .",
    "[ fig-9 ] , it was expected to observe a calorimetric signal on warming above 10  k , where the @xmath90 line slowly changes its slope but we were unable to detect any specific heat contribution . clearly in an inhomogeneous model , so far @xmath81 ( @xmath91  gpa )",
    ", @xmath14 can not be discriminated from @xmath13 .",
    "the persistence of nesting in all the pressure range is in excellent agreement with the stability of the fermi surface @xcite and also the shape of the resistivity anomaly close to @xmath13 above @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "one scheme is that , at low pressure , the molecular field acting on the localized spin ( which is the combined result of an exchange among localized spin and of an interaction via the polarization of the quasi - particles ) is too weak for the appearance of lmaf while nesting is quite favorable @xcite .",
    "at the critical pressure @xmath7 , its strength become critical and lmaf is the new stable solution as predicted for the induced magnetism on singlet crystal field ground state .",
    "another open question is if @xmath7 does not mark a tiny discontinuous change of the valence inducing differences in spin and orbital 5@xmath11 components",
    ". the uru@xmath1si@xmath1 case may be similar to the ybincu@xmath92 @xcite or smb@xmath8 @xcite excitations with a first order point between an intermediate valent state and long range magnetism and also a residual phase separation around @xmath7 .",
    "there is no doubt that sc is linked to ho .",
    "when @xmath81 , sc disappears .",
    "all experiments agree with the disappearance of sc around @xmath78 .",
    "recent ac susceptibility measurements suggest that @xmath16 collapse discontinuously at @xmath7 @xcite , while a dc magnetization probe @xcite indicates that @xmath16 may reach zero only near @xmath78 as reported already by pressure and field resistivity studies . ac calorimetry experiments are required to clarify this issue . in resistivity experiments",
    "it was also found that the @xmath93 coefficient of the @xmath94 term drops by a factor of 4 between ambient pressure and 2 gpa @xcite in agreement with the image of the development of a large molecular field below @xmath14 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in resistivity measurements even above @xmath7 the derived @xmath64 curves follow the pressure variation of the effective mass @xmath95 assuming the usual proportionality @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "as has been observed for the sublattice magnetization in detail , in an inhomogeneous description with a fraction of ho in lmaf and reciprocally , the extrinsic properties are coupled to the bulk properties .",
    "an interesting problem is the behavior of uru@xmath1si@xmath1 under magnetic field . from earlier hall effect measurements @xcite and their recent extension to rh doping @xcite it was clear that the closing of the sdw gap at @xmath97  t leads to recover a high carrier number as generally found in metallic heavy - fermion antiferromagnets .",
    "the high magnetic field phase diagram of uru@xmath1si@xmath1 reflects the interplay between nesting and localized magnetism .",
    "the cascade of high field induced ordered phase ( ii , iii , v ) in ref .",
    "@xcite is directly linked to the drastic increase in the carrier number ; the polarized paramagnetic phase iv is quite similar to that found in ceru@xmath1si@xmath1 . of course",
    ", different fields can modulate the interplay but the disappearance of nesting governs the entrance in the pm state : @xmath98 .",
    "for the ho phase , no clear evidence has been found on another ordered state than sdw . however , even the nesting vector of the sdw is not determined ; it is only suspected to be the ( 1,0,0 ) wavevector of the lmaf .",
    "a yet unclear problem is the link between the main spin excitations @xmath99 and @xmath100 at the wavevectors ( 1,0,0 ) and ( 1.4,0,0 ) @xcite : are they coupled via a dispersion relation or the result of two different origins ? at zero pressure in magnetic field , @xmath99 increases and seems to reach @xmath100 at @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "this supports the idea that above @xmath101 the 5@xmath11 electrons are governed by local fluctuations . in zero magnetic field @xmath99 appears to collapse for @xmath102 while @xmath100 increases @xcite .    with this new exploration of the ( @xmath103 ) phase diagram of uru@xmath1si@xmath1 , an evidence is given of the coexistence of lmaf with sdw at high pressure .",
    "soon , x - ray scattering experiments under @xmath4 will be realized to confirm if lmaf is set up at @xmath14 above @xmath13 for @xmath104  gpa . extended combined studies under extreme conditions",
    "( with large @xmath105 scans ) will also clarify the magnetic and electronic duality of the localized and itinerant component of the 5@xmath11 electrons .",
