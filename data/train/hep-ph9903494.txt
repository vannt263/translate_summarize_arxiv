    "the standard model of particle physics has been studied with very high precision over the course of the past ten years , and no significant deviations have been found . despite this , our understanding of the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking is still incomplete .",
    "this arises in large part because the only remaining undetected standard model particle , the higgs boson , mediates electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model .",
    "the highest available center  of  mass energy for the years 2000 to 2004 will be at the fermilab tevatron @xmath0 collider with @xmath1  tev .",
    "it is natural to explore the sensitivity to higgs production at the tevatron .",
    "this paper contains preliminary results from a year  long study conducted jointly by the fermilab theory group and the cdf and d  experiments .",
    "the goal is to quantify the higgs discovery potential at the tevatron in the coming run ii and possible extensions .",
    "results are presented as the luminosities required to exclude higgs at the 95% confidence level , or to establish either 3@xmath2 or 5@xmath2 excesses over predicted backgrounds .",
    "the starting points for this study are the higgs mass constraints expected from lep2@xcite and previous fermilab studies@xcite@xcite .",
    "this study extends the previous fermilab results by ( 1 ) including additional standard model decays in the mass regions previously explored , ( 2 ) testing the sensitivity for higgs masses @xmath3  gev , ( 3 ) systematically combining results from all channels , ( 4 ) interpreting the results as supersymmetric(susy ) higgs production and ( 5 ) considering additional decay modes arising from susy models .",
    "in addition , a detector simulation was developed which gives significantly more realistic event reconstruction than some of the previous studies used .",
    "this paper has six sections .",
    "the first describes the production and decay of standard model higgs bosons and the simulations used in this study .",
    "the second and third sections contain results for standard model higgs production in the mass ranges @xmath4  gev and @xmath5  gev respectively .",
    "the fourth section presents the combination of the results in sections two and three .",
    "the fifth section describes the extension of the results to susy production .",
    "the last section describes studies of additional susy  specific decays , particularly final states having four @xmath6quarks .",
    "the production cross sections and decay branching ratios for a higgs bosons have been calculated by a number of groups.@xcite those for a standard model higgs boson are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - info ] .",
    "these plots indicate that the highest cross section production modes are @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the higgs decays dominantly to the most massive kinematically allowed final state . for @xmath10  gev ,",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath11 with a branching ratio of roughly 80% . for @xmath3  gev ,",
    "the dominant mode is @xmath12 .",
    "thus , searches for lower",
    " mass higgs will be looking for final states with at least two @xmath6flavored jets , and the higher mass searches will have multiple ( virtual ) @xmath13 bosons . for most of the mass range in question , the @xmath7 mode has very poor signal  to  noise , and the most useful modes are the @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes with the @xmath13 or @xmath14 decaying to leptons .    -.2",
    "cm    unless explicitly noted , events used in these analyses were generated using the pythia@xcite , isajet@xcite or comphep@xcite programs .",
    "the generated four  vectors were then input to a detector simulation program , shw , developed for the run ii workshop@xcite .",
    "this program uses parameterized resolutions for tracking and calorimeter systems and particle identification to perform simple reconstruction of tracks , calorimeter  based jets , vertices and trigger objects .",
    "the resolutions used represent a typical run ii detector and are drawn from cdf and d  internal studies .",
    "particle identification efficiencies are included by parameterizing results from other cdf and d  studies .",
    "the shw program was verified by comparing selection efficiencies between shw and data or between shw and well  established run i simulations used by cdf or d .",
    "the most stringent test was a comparison of nearly identical analyses of the @xmath15 channel .",
    "two analyses of this channel have been performed , one based on a run i cdf simulation with the geometrical acceptance extended to correspond to the run ii cdf detector and the second based purely on shw .",
    "the first analysis predicts @xmath16 signal events and @xmath17 background events / fb@xmath18 for @xmath19  gev .",
    "the second predicts @xmath20 signal and @xmath21 background events for the same conditions .",
    "when @xmath10  gev , the dominant decay mode is @xmath11 .",
    "analyses have been performed for all @xmath8 and @xmath9 final states . was considered , but the signal to noise was too poor for it to have any sensitivity when compared to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes . ] the possible final states are : ( 1 ) @xmath22 , ( 2 ) @xmath23 , ( 3 ) @xmath24 and ( 4 ) @xmath25 or @xmath26 . the primary backgrounds to these channels are @xmath27 and @xmath28 with the @xmath29 pair from gluon radiation , single top  quark production and top ",
    "quark pair production .",
    "all analyses for these channels begin with a preliminary selection based on the number and type of final state objects .",
    "for example , the @xmath22 analysis requires a charged lepton with @xmath30  gev , missing transverse energy @xmath31  gev and two @xmath6tagged jets having @xmath32  gev .",
    "similar selections are applied for the other channels .",
    "after the basic selection , a requirement is made that the mass of the reconstructed @xmath29 system be within ( typically ) 2@xmath2 of the generated higgs mass .",
    "additional clean up requirements are also made . as an example , in the @xmath33 channel , there can be no isolated tracks with @xmath34  gev .",
    "this rejects events with high-@xmath35 leptons which failed the lepton identification .",
    "the resulting number of signal and background events corresponding to 1  fb@xmath18 of data are given in table  [ t - lowmass ] .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 modes offer the best sensitivity with the @xmath24 mode not far behind .",
    "the all  hadronic final state looks quite difficult .",
    "in addition to these analyses , a multivariate analysis using neural networks has been peformed for the @xmath22 channel .",
    "this style of analysis has been used with considerable success by d  in the top mass@xcite and all  hadronic top decay analyses.@xcite the basic principle is to exploit correlations within an event in an automatic manner .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f - nn1 ] shows the number of predicted signal and background events for @xmath36 analyses .",
    "each point in the figure represents one possible analysis .",
    "the band labelled `` rgsearch '' corresponds to hypothetical analyses performed using selections using the standard technique of sequential requirements applied to event variables , with each requirement a single  valued comparison such as @xmath31  gev .",
    "the point labelled `` tev 2000 '' is the result from a previous fermilab study@xcite .",
    "the point labelled `` neural net '' is the result from the multivariate analysis .",
    "one sees that for a fixed background , the signal is increased by roughly 50% using the neural network .",
    "similar gains are expected in all other channels in this mass range .",
    "results have also been obtained for hypothetical improvements in mass reconstruction and @xmath6jet tagging efficiency .",
    "the analyses were repeated after artifically improving the reconstructed dijet mass resolution in steps up to a 50% better resolution .",
    "the results in table  [ t - lowmass ] include an improvement in mass resolution of 30% .",
    "this level of improvement is possible when information such as charged track energy is used in the mass reconstruction in assocation with the calorimeter  based jet energies currently used .",
    "such an improvement has already been realized in a preliminary run i cdf analysis of the @xmath37 channel.@xcite improved mass resolution offers considerable benefits because for a selection with a fixed signal expectation , the background will decrease as the resolution improves .",
    "the effect of improved @xmath6jet tagging has also been explored by artificially improving the second jet tagging efficiency by up to a factor of two .",
    "the gains from this improvement are not as important as those from mass resolution improvements because both signal and background increase with improved tagging efficiency .",
    "previous fermilab studies have concentrated on the lower mass higgs states which decay dominantly to @xmath29 .",
    "this study includes analyses designed for final states in which the higgs decays to @xmath38 or @xmath39 instead of @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds approximately to @xmath3  gev .",
    "three final states are considered : ( 1 ) three leptons , @xmath40 , arising primarily from @xmath41 , ( 2 ) dileptons and neutrinos , @xmath42 , from @xmath43 and ( 3 ) like - sign dileptons plus jets , @xmath44 , from @xmath41 and @xmath45.@xcite the dominant backgrounds are standard model production of @xmath38 , @xmath46 , @xmath39 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 and multijet events with misidentification arising from detector effects .",
    "the standard model sources dominate the detector effects .    as for the low mass analyses ,",
    "the initial selections are based on simple variables related to the boson decay ",
    "product kinematics . however , to reach usable sensitivity , the analyses then use either ( 1 ) requirements typically relating to angular correlations arising from spin differences between signal and background or ( b ) likelihood methods . in both cases new variables have been designed .",
    "figure  [ f - hm ] shows one such variable used in the @xmath42 analysis , the cluster mass @xmath49 .",
    "the results in the preceeding two sections have also been combined to form a single unified result .",
    "figure  [ f - combo ] shows the luminosities required for 95% cl exclusion , 3@xmath2 evidence and 5@xmath2 discovery as a function of standard model higgs mass .",
    "these contours include statistical and systematic errors and the channels are combined using the prescription of reference  @xcite .",
    "most supersymmetric extensions of the standard model result in five physical higgs states , two neutral scalars denoted @xmath50 and @xmath51(with @xmath52 ) , a single pseudoscalar @xmath53 and the charged doublet @xmath54 . unlike most other supersymmetric particles",
    ", the masses of the higgs particles depend only on two parameters , typically chosen to be @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath50 boson must satisfy @xmath58  gev , and it may easily be less massive that this . for much of susy phase space ,",
    "the @xmath50 decay is identical to that of the standard model higgs , and only the production cross section differs . given this , the searches for low mass standard model higgs can be easily converted to searches for susy higgs .",
    "the left  hand panel of fig .",
    "[ f - hsusy ] shows the 5@xmath2 exclusion contour in the @xmath55 vs. @xmath56 plane for the case in which all non - higgs susy masses are around 1  tev , the systematic error is 10% , and cdf and d  data are combined .",
    "one sees that for this example , susy models having @xmath59 and @xmath60  gev are excluded .",
    "within susy models , new higgs production modes exist , some with couplings proportional to @xmath63 . for sufficiently large values of @xmath55",
    "these become the dominant production modes .",
    "one such mode is @xmath64 or @xmath51 in place of @xmath50 . ] .",
    "this results in final states containing four @xmath6flavored jets .",
    "analyses of this channel have been carried out . these typically require four jets , three of which satisfy @xmath6tag requirements .",
