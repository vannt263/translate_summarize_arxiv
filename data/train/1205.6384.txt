    "v405and is an x - ray emitting active binary detected by the rosat satellite @xcite .",
    "the first detailed study of the system was done by @xcite , who detected an orbital period of @xmath1 days , and a small , near grazing eclipse .",
    "the authors found that the primary and the secondary have spectral types of m0v and m5v , and both of them are active , as both show h@xmath2 emission .",
    "@xcite presented photometric @xmath3 data , analysed optical spectroscopic measurements , and found , that the light curve modulation is caused by the combined effect of spottedness and binarity . using an iterative modelling method to separately describe these two effects",
    ", the authors determined the physical properties of this binary system .",
    "the primary and the secondary component was found to have masses of @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , thus the primary is supposed to consist of a radiative core , and a convective envelope , while the secondary is probably fully convective .",
    "the radii of the two components are @xmath6 and @xmath7 . plotting these values on the theoretical mass - radius diagram of @xcite together with other binaries , we find that the secondary fits well to this relation , but the primary has a significantly larger radius than the theoretically predicted value .",
    "we have obtained new @xmath3 photometry with the 1 m rcc telescope at piszkstet between jds 2455148 and 2455531 ( 2009 november2010 november , about 700 days after the light curves modelled in @xcite ) .",
    "previously we found the light curve to be stable @xcite , but during the time of the new observations the surface seemed to evolve significantly .",
    "the main spotted area moved from phase @xmath8 to phase @xmath9 in the first two new seasons , and in the last season two active nests were observed : around phases 0.1 and 0.5 .    using the same modelling method described in @xcite , we modelled the new observations using phoebe @xcite and spotmodel @xcite .",
    "the light curves and the fits are plotted in fig .",
    "the models fitted to the new observations left the system parameters unchanged .",
    "this indicates , that the radius of the primary is indeed much larger than expected .",
    "the two known similar binaries with similar structure , gsc 2314 - 0530 @xcite and the one from @xcite does not show this behaviour , although the primary of 2mass 04463285 + 1901432 @xcite has somewhat larger radius .",
    "this indicates that v405and is a currently unique system , definitely worth for further studies .",
