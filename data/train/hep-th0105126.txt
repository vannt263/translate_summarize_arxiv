    "in this paper , we first give a short introduction to the @xmath0deformed fuzzy sphere , and then discuss some aspects of second quantization on this space .",
    "this is essentially a short introduction to the more extensive discussion in @xcite .",
    "much of the considerations concerning the second quantization generalize to other , higher  dimensional @xmath0deformed spaces .",
    "the @xmath0deformed fuzzy sphere @xmath1 is a @xmath0deformed version of the `` ordinary '' fuzzy sphere @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the algebra of functions on @xmath1 is isomorphic to the matrix algebra @xmath7 , but viewed as a @xmath3module algebra .",
    "it admits additional structure compatible with covariance under the drinfeld ",
    "jimbo quantum group @xmath3 , such as an invariant integral and a differential calculus .",
    "it can be defined for both @xmath2 and @xmath8 , however we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath2 here .",
    "then @xmath1 is precisely the `` discrete series '' of podles spheres @xcite .",
    "moreover , we only consider scalar fields for simplicity .",
    "a much more detailed description of @xmath1 has been given in @xcite .",
    "this space is of interest in the context of @xmath9branes on the @xmath10 wzw model , as discussed by alekseev , recknagel and schomerus @xcite .",
    "these authors extract an `` effective '' algebra of functions on the @xmath9branes from the ope of the boundary vertex operators , which is twist ",
    "equivalent @xcite to the space of functions on @xmath1 for @xmath0 a root of unity .",
    "consider the spin @xmath12 of @xmath3 , @xmath13 which acts on @xmath14 .",
    "it can be used to define the quantum adjoint action of @xmath3 on the set of matrices @xmath7 , by @xmath15 the usual matrix algebra @xmath7 thereby becomes a @xmath3module algebra , which means that @xmath16 for @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 denotes the coproduct of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath11 is defined to be precisely this @xmath3module algebra @xmath7 , together with some additional structure .",
    "it is easy to see that under the ( adjoint ) action of @xmath3 , it decomposes into the irreducible s^2_q , n= mat(n+1 , ) = ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ...",
    "( 2n+1 ) , [ hste - decomp ] where @xmath20 is the spin @xmath21 of @xmath3 .",
    "this is the analog of the decomposition of functions on the sphere into spherical harmonics , which it is truncated on the fuzzy spheres .",

    "the star of an element @xmath37 is simply defined to be the hermitean adjoint of the matrix @xmath38 . in terms of the generators",
    "@xmath39 , this becomes @xmath40 since @xmath0 is real .",
    "@xmath1 admits additional structure , in particular a differential calculus .",
    "while the calculus is very interesting in the context of gauge theories , we shall not discuss it here .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "however , we do need a laplacian in order to write down lagrangians and actions . while it can naturally be defined using the differential calculus as @xmath41 , we give an ad  hoc definition here for simplicity .",
    "assume that @xmath42 is a weight basis of the spin @xmath21 of @xmath3 , so that u _ q _ k , n(x ) = _ k , m(x ) ^m_n(u ) .",

    "we can now write down lagrangians and actions defining scalar field theory on @xmath45 . consider for example @xmath46 = - \\int\\frac 12\\;\\psi \\delta \\psi + \\lambda\\psi^4   = s_{free}[\\psi ] + s_{int}[\\psi]\\ ] ] where ( x ) = _ k , n _ k , n(x ) a^k , n .",
    "[ hste - psi_field ] the free action can be rewritten as , which is another copy of @xmath3 but with reversed coproduct , see @xcite . ]",

    "we want to discuss the second quantization of such models , as in @xcite . on the undeformed fuzzy sphere , this is fairly straightforward @xcite : the coefficients @xmath48 are considered as complex numbers or more precisely as coordinate functions ] on the representation space @xmath50 , so that the actions can be considered as polynomials in the algebra @xmath51 .",
    "the `` path integral '' is then simply the product of the ordinary integrals over the coefficients @xmath48 , i.e. over @xmath52 .",
    "this defines a quantum field theory which has a @xmath53 rotation symmetry , because the path integral is invariant .    in the @xmath0deformed case",
    ", this is not as easy , and needs some discussion .",
    "we certainly want the models to have a @xmath3 symmetry at the quantum level .",
    "this means that the coefficients @xmath48 in ( [ hste - psi_field ] ) must be considered as of @xmath3 . in order to be able to do calculations",
    ", we also require that the @xmath48 generate some kind of algebra @xmath54 ; this is almost a tautology .",
    "this strongly suggests that @xmath54 should be a @xmath3module algebra .",
    "we do not have in mind here an algebra of field operators , which in fact would not be appropriate in the euclidean case even for @xmath30 .",
    "rather , @xmath54 should be an analog of the algebra of coordinate functions on configuration space as above for @xmath30 , i.e. some deformed version of @xmath55 .",
    "our goal is to define correlation functions of the fields ( [ hste - psi_field ] ) , which after `` fourier transform '' amounts to defining a^k_1,n_1 a^k_2,n_2 ... a^k_k , n_k= : p(a ) , [ hste - correlation - function ] perhaps by some kind of a path integral @xmath56 }   p(a)$ ] .",
    "@xmath57 will denote some polynomial in the variables @xmath48 from now on .",
    "it follows immediately from these considerations that @xmath54 can not be commutative , because the coproduct of @xmath3 is not cocommutative .",
    "in particular , the @xmath48 can not be ordinary complex numbers .",
    "therefore an ordinary integral over commutative modes @xmath48 would violate @xmath3 invariance at the quantum level . in some sense",
    ", this means that on @xmath0deformed spaces , a second quantization is required by consistency .",
    "there is one more essential requirement : @xmath54 should have the same poincar series as classically , i.e. the dimension of the space of polynomials at a given degree should be the same as in the undeformed case .",
    "this is in fact precisely the content of a symmetrization postulate , and it is of course an essential physical requirement at least for low energies , in order to have the correct number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it means that the `` amount of information '' contained in the @xmath58point functions should be the same as for @xmath30 , so that a smooth limit @xmath4 is conceivable . in other words ,",
    "we want to consider ordinary bosons .",
    "while some proposals have been given in the literature @xcite how to define qft on spaces with quantum group symmetry , none of them seems to satisfy these requirements .      * _ covariance : _ @xmath59 which means that the @xmath60 are invariant tensors of @xmath49 , * _ hermiticity : _ @xmath61 for a suitable involution @xmath62 on @xmath54 , * _ positivity : _ @xmath63 * _ symmetry _ + under permutations of the fields , by which we mean that the polynomials in the @xmath48 can be ordered as usual , i.e. the poincar series of @xmath54 should be underformed .      unfortunately , there is no obvious candidate for an associative @xmath3module algebra @xmath54 with the same poincar series as @xmath55 ( except for small @xmath64 ) .",
    "we will therefore construct a suitable quasiassociative algebra @xmath54 which is a star ",
    "deformation of the commutative @xmath55 .",
    "we want to emphasise that quasiassociativity is in no way inconsistent with the usual axioms of quantum mechanics , because the algebra @xmath54 will not be interpreted as algebra of observables ; it is only a tool which is useful to calculate correlation functions , just like grassman variables are used to calculate fermionic correlation functions .",
    "in fact , it is possible to avoid the use of quasiassociative algebras alltogether , see @xcite .",
    "any lingering doubts can be eliminated by showing the equivalence of our models to ordinary qft on the undeformed fuzzzy sphere , with slightly derformed interactions .",
    "as discussed , we assume that the coefficients @xmath48 transform in the spin @xmath21 of @xmath49 , u _",
    "q a^k , n = ^n_m(s u ) a^k , m .",
    "[ hste - a_covar ] let @xmath65 be the algebra ( not coalgebra!)isomorphism @xcite @xmath66,\\ ] ] where @xmath67",
    ". moreover , let @xmath68\\tens u(su(2))[[h]]$ ] be the `` drinfeld  twist '' @xcite which relates the hopf algebras @xmath49 and @xmath69 , and satisfies among others & = & * 1**1*+o(h ) , + ( ) & = & * 1*= ( ) , [ hste - cond2 ] + ( ) _ q(u)&= & ( ( u))^-1 , + ( ) & = & _ 21 q^t2 ^ -1 . for any @xmath70 . using this twist , there is an action of @xmath69 on the coefficients @xmath48 , by @xmath71 .",
    "hence we can consider the usual commutative algebra @xmath72 generated by the @xmath48 , and view it as a @xmath69module algebra @xmath73 .",
    "we now then define a new multiplication on the same space @xmath54 by a b : = ( ^-1_1a ) ( ^-1_2b ) = ( ^-1 ( ab ) ) [ hste - star ] for any @xmath74 .",
    "this is analogous to the moyal product in deformation quantization .",
    "it is easy to verify that it satisfies @xmath75 which means that @xmath76 is a @xmath49module algebra .",
    "it follows from ( [ hste - cond2 ] ) that if @xmath77 is invariant under @xmath49 , then it is also central in @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , the following commutation relations are derived in @xcite : a_i a_j - a_k a_l _",
    "ij^lk = 0 , [ hste - cr ] were @xmath79 is obtained from the universal @xmath80 matrix of @xmath49 .",
    "this new product is not associative , but quasiassocative : @xmath81 here @xmath82[(\\delta\\tens \\id)\\f^{-1}](\\f^{-1}\\tens { { \\bf 1 } } )     \\ ] ] is the coassociator , which is invariant under @xmath3 and closely related to the kz equation @xcite .",
    "it is much easier to work with than the drinfeld - twist @xmath83 , which in fact is never needed explicitly .",
    "finally , @xmath84 is defined as in ( [ hste - star ] ) , applied to any element of @xmath85 .",
    "polynomials @xmath86 must now be given including some `` bracketing '' .",
    "nevertheless , the poincar series of @xmath54 is undeformed , because the vector space @xmath54 is undeformed , and the new product preserves the grading .",
    "different bracketings can always be related using the coassociator .",
    "the path integral should be a `` functional '' on @xmath54 which is invariant under @xmath49 .",
    "as in deformation quantization , we view @xmath87 as the vector space of complex  valued functions on @xmath50 , and consider the usual classical integral over @xmath50 .",
    "observe that it is also invariant under the action @xmath88 ( [ hste - a_covar ] ) of @xmath49 , because the algebra structure does not enter here at all .",
    "explicitly , let @xmath89 be the ordinary integral of @xmath90 over @xmath50 .",
    "the path integral is then defined as @xmath91 : = \\int \\prod_k d^{2k+1}\\!a^{k}\\ ; f[\\psi],\\ ] ] where @xmath92 \\in \\a$ ] denotes any integrable function ( in the usual sense ) of the variables @xmath93 .",
    "it is by construction invariant under @xmath49 .",
    "correlation functions can now be defined as functionals of `` bracketed polynomials '' @xmath94 in the field coefficients by p_(a):= .",
    "[ hste - correlation ] this is natural , because all invariant actions @xmath95 $ ] commute with the generators @xmath48 .",
    "strictly speaking there should be a factor @xmath96 in front of the action , which we shall omit .",
    "invariance of the action @xmath95 \\in \\a$ ] implies that @xmath97 by construction , the number of independent modes of a polynomial @xmath86 with given degree is the same as for @xmath30 .",
    "one can in fact order them , using quasiassociativity together with the commutation relations ( [ hste - cr ] ) .",
    "therefore the symmetry requirement ( 4 ) above is satisfied .",
    "using a suitable formalism , one can show that the requirements ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are satisfied as well , see @xcite .",
    "the field theories defined in this way are equivalent to ordinary qft s on the undeformed fuzzy sphere , with slightly nonlocal interactions .",
    "consider an interaction term of the form ( [ hste - example ] ) .",
    "if we write down explicitly the definition of the @xmath98 product of the @xmath48 variables , then it can be viewed as an interaction term of @xmath48 variables with a tensor which is invariant under the _ undeformed _ @xmath69 , obtained from the @xmath49invariant tensor by multiplication with the twist @xmath99 . in other words",
    ", the above actions can also be viewed as actions on the undeformed fuzzy sphere @xmath100 , with interactions which are slightly `` nonlocal '' in the sense of @xmath100 , i.e. they are given by traces of products of matrices only to the lowest order in @xmath101 . upon spelling out the @xmath98 product in the correlation functions ( [ hste - correlation ] ) as well ,",
    "they can be considered as ordinary correlation functions of a slightly nonlocal field theory on @xmath100 , disguised by the transformation @xmath83 . therefore @xmath0deformation simply amounts to some kind of nonlocality of the interactions .",
    "a similar interpretation is well  known in the context of field theories on spaces with a moyal product .",
    "the author thanks j. lukierski and the organizers of the xxxvii winter school of theoretical physics in karpacz for hospitality and stimulating atmosphere during the school .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank h.grosse and j. madore for collaboration on the two papers @xcite underlying this report , as well as g. fiore , s. majid , r. oeckl and j. pawelczyk for useful discussions ."
