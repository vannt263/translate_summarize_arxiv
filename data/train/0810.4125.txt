    "surface barrier effects in type ii superconductors have been predicted by bean and livingston  @xcite and de gennes.@xcite the entry of flux lines into a planar type ii superconductor situated in an external magnetic field @xmath0 parallel to its surface is opposed by a strong surface barrier when @xmath1 , the first critical field .",
    "therefore the entry of flux lines could occur at a field value @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the second critical field .",
    "these surface barrier effects have been observed experimentally in the @xmath4s on lead thallium alloys  @xcite and on niobium metal,@xcite and make it difficult to measure directly thermodynamic properties of the superconductor .    typically surface barriers are reduced due to surface disorder , which creates large local magnetic fields and allows for nucleation of vortices .",
    "suppression of surface barriers for flux penetration was observed on ybacuo  @xcite and in bisrcacuo whiskers  @xcite due to heavy ion irradiation . in ellipsoid - shaped ybacuo",
    "it has been argued that due to roughness of submicrometer order the surface barrier does not push the penetration field @xmath5 above @xmath6 but only lowers the rate of vortex entry.@xcite    another source for the delay of the entry of flux lines into superconductors is the ",
    "geometrical barrier\",@xcite which is particularly important in thin films of constant thickness ( i.e. , rectangular cross section ) .",
    "this effect is absent only when the superconductor is of exactly ellipsoidal shape or is tapered like a wedge with a sharp edge where flux penetration is facilitated .",
    "the resulting absence of hysteresis in wedge - shaped samples was nicely shown by morozov et al .",
    "@xcite    .",
    "[ fg:1 ] , width=264 ]    in this paper we study another source for delay of entrance of flux lines , due to inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field . in particular we consider magnetic field produced by an external current @xmath7 flowing parallel to the surface of a type ii superconductor , see fig .",
    "1 . the magnetic field produced by the external",
    "current enters the sample as curved vortices at sufficiently large current .",
    "we find that the entrance of the first line occurs when the induced magnetic field at the surface at the position closest to the wire already exceeds the bulk critical field @xmath6 .",
    "this delay in entrance of the curved vortices occurs due to geometrical reasons : the entry and outlet points are associated with an energy cost @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the penetration depth , @xmath10 is the flux quantum , and @xmath11 is the free permeability . note that @xmath12 , implying that in typical superconductors this is a large energy scale .",
    "in addition the spatially averaged magnetic field experienced by the vortex is lower than the the maximal one occurring closest to the wire . considering those effects in an actual calculation",
    "we find how large a magnetic field can be applied locally without introducing vortices into the sample .",
    "this implies that application of magnetic field by an external current near the sc can be convenient for experiments demanding sizable magnetic fields in the vortex - free state .",
    "as such an experiment we mention the london - hall effect.@xcite whereas this effect was observed in regular superconductors,@xcite it is now interesting to measure it in high temperature superconductors .",
    "typically @xmath6 is quite low in these materials and therefore vortices penetrate the sample at very low homogeneous magnetic fields ; hence our geometry can be useful .",
    "however other surface effects seem to be an additional obstacle for the observation of the london effect in high temperature superconductors.@xcite    a parameter which we leave out of consideration in this work is anisotropy of the superconductor , which is particularly important in high temperature layered superconductors . in the case of strong anisotropy additional complications enter the problem even in the case of uniform magnetic field , where the direction of the vortices deviates from the direction of the external magnetic field.@xcite for certain ( elliptical ) treatment of the short distance cutoff the vortices can have two different directions , corresponding to two degenerate minima in the free energy.@xcite    we argue that strong anisotropy is expected to have important effects in our geometry , increasing further the maximal local magnetic field allowed before curved flux lines penetrate the sample . consider the case where the @xmath13 axis of a uniaxially anisotropic superconductor corresponds to the direction @xmath14 in our geometry , @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the surface of the superconductor , parallel to the external wire , corresponds to an ab - plane . in the limit of strong anisotropy",
    "@xmath16 the bulk critical field parallel to the surface @xmath17 becomes very small . on the other hand , the entry and outlet points of the flux line",
    "are associated with a large energy cost @xmath18 independent of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore we expect the maximal surface magnetic field before the entry of the first vortex to increase relative to @xmath6 as a function of @xmath20 .",
