    "the majority of our knowledge of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) stems from over 200 observations of these objects by both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "the elevated x - ray luminosities of ulxs have raised intriguing questions about their nature and the source of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "a natural explanation for the substantial x - ray luminosities is the presence of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbh , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however substantiating evidence for such objects is lacking @xcite .",
    "attention has switched to less exotic sources for the emission , such as beaming @xcite or super - eddington accretion from a stellar mass black hole @xcite , both of which explain ulx x - ray properties without an imbh .",
    "the idea is not far fetched , since examples of super - eddington sources have been found in our galaxy , such as grs  1915 + 105 @xcite , v4641  sgr @xcite and possibly ss  433 .",
    "indeed ss  433 could be an example of both beaming _ and _ super - eddington accretion , the combination of which could easily explain even the most luminous ulxs @xcite .",
    "very little work has been done on ulxs at non x - ray wavelengths , especially in comparison with agn and galactic stellar - mass black holes .",
    "this is in part because , unlike standard agn , the emission from the accretion process itself is harder to detect at these wavelengths .",
    "indeed , the x - ray to optical luminosity ratios in ulxs are at least ten times higher compared to those seen in agn @xcite . to make matters worse , there are no ulxs in our own galaxy ( though ss  433 is regarded as a ulx by some authors ) , and the stellar ulx companions are very difficult to identify in other galaxies .",
    "what little multi - wavelength work done on ulxs thus far has been executed primarily with high resolution optical spectroscopy . in a few cases ,",
    "ulxs have been found to have an observable effect on their local environment - developing ionized bubble nebulae of up to 500  pc diameter @xcite .",
    "these are much larger than regular supernova remnants and energy estimates show that the bubbles are consistent with being blown either by relativistic jets from a ulx , or abnormally powerful supernovae . in some cases high - excitation lines have been detected , such as he  ii @xmath34686 ( i.p .  @xmath4  54.4  ev ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "only very hot wolf - rayet stars can produce this line @xcite , but the ulx companions are not such stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of the he  ii line must be due to the interaction of the ulx with the surrounding medium .",
    "interestingly , ss  433 is also surrounded by a 100  pc radio nebula , w  50 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of ionization nebulae for investigating x - ray sources has long been realized , beginning with the first detection of nebulae around supersoft sources such as lmc x - l @xcite and cal  83 @xcite in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the high - excitation lines observed in nebulae , such as the he  ii recombination line , can act as giant bolometers for the ionizing uv and x - ray emission , thus allowing the intrinsic hard spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to be inferred .",
    "long - term averaged luminosities can be estimated and the uv emission constrained .",
    "this provides tremendous value when studying the nature of ambiguous ulxs , because the luminosities estimated from ionization are independent of x - ray spectral modeling estimates .",
    "in fact , such luminosities are more accurate , because the x - ray - based estimates are in general lower bounds and depend on the viewing angle .",
    "more importantly , the ionization - estimated luminosities are time - averaged estimates , which is critical for variable sources such as ulxs .",
    "this is especially true for ulxs with very few x - ray observations , since some of these sources can be transient . on the other hand ,",
    "photoionization modeling is dependent on many parameters which are often not known very precisely , such as the gas density , geometry , metallicity etc .",
    "contamination from other ionizing sources is also a concern especially in crowded regions .",
    "however , when used together , x - ray analysis and photoionization modeling can provide good constraints on the ulx luminosity .",
    "for example , a simple comparison between the two estimates can constrain the beaming factor .",
    "one of the most interesting examples of an ionized nebula associated with a ulx is located in the dwarf galaxy holmberg  ii @xcite .",
    "he  ii is detected in a small nebular region around the ulx , the `` heel '' of the `` foot nebula '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kwz hereafter ) .",
    "an ob star is the likely counterpart ( kwz ) .",
    "the morphology of he  ii emission and other optical lines is consistent with the photoionization of the nebula by the ulx .",
    "kwz confirmed this with cloudy simulations .",
    "@xcite detected extended radio emission from a @xmath550  pc diameter region coincident with the position of the ulx .",
    "the authors conclude that the flux and morphology of the radio emission is inconsistent with emission from a snr or an h  ii region , and is probably associated with the ulx activity .",
    "in this paper and a subsequent companion paper we use ir _ spitzer _ spectroscopic observations for the first time to constrain the underlying hard sed of a ulx .",
    "the ir observations , when combined with previously published optical and x - ray data , suggest that the powerful uv and soft x - ray emission from the holmberg  ii ulx photoionizes the surrounding medium . in section  2 we present the _ spitzer _",
    "irs data analysis and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray spectral fitting results .",
    "we perform additional photometry measurements with the infrared array camera ( irac ) , the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) , the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) and optical monitor ( om ) instruments on _ xmm - newton _ , and the galaxy evolution explorer ( _ galex _ ) . in section  3 we analyze the possible contribution of self - irradiated accretion disk to the uv and optical fluxes . in section  4",
    "we use our data and other published data to construct an sed of the holmberg  ii ulx .",
    "this is also used in the companion paper to further constrain the x - ray spectrum . in sections  5 and 6",
    "we discuss the significance of the [ o  iv ] line detection , compare the ir line ratios with those of agn and present the final observational results .",
    "a follow - up paper will present detailed photoionization analysis of the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "we begin this section with a description of the _ spitzer _ irs @xcite observation of the holmberg  ii ulx .",
    "we next present multi - wavelength photometry and x - ray spectroscopy used in the subsequent section to construct the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the ulx .",
    "the data presented here are archival _ spitzer _",
    "data , taken on 2004 october 4 , as part of the legacy program _",
    "spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey _ ( sings program  193 , see * ? ? ?",
    "the irs spectral map is described by three parallel pointings and five perpendicular at half - slit steps , for both short high ( sh , in the range 9.9 - 19.6  @xmath0 m ) and long high ( lh , in the range 18.7 @xmath6 37.2  @xmath0 m ) modules .",
    "the total exposure time was 240  s for both sh and lh observations .",
    "the data were preprocessed by the irs pipeline ( version 11 ) at the _ spitzer _ science center prior to download .",
    "spectral maps were constructed using `` bcd - level '' processed data in conjunction with cubism ( cube builder for irs spectra maps ) version 1.5 @xcite .",
    "the absolute calibration error on fluxes obtained with cubism is @xmath525% @xcite .",
    "we adopt a distance of 3.05  mpc to holmberg  ii ( kwz , 1@xmath7 is 15  pc ) .",
    "the lh maps obtained with cubism have intrinsic sizes of 44.6@xmath7 by 28.8@xmath7 ( 670  pc by 430  pc ) , while the sh maps are 27@xmath7 by 13.6@xmath7 ( 405  pc by 205  pc ) .",
    "however , in order to avoid aperture effects , the spectra presented here were extracted from like - sized apertures .",
    "thus the sh and lh spectral data result from an equally sized aperture of 23@xmath7 by 13.6@xmath7 ( 340  pc by 205  pc ) , which is only slightly smaller than the full sh aperture .",
    "we also extract spectra from the smallest aperture permitted by cubism : an 8.9@xmath7 by 8.9@xmath7 aperture centered on the ulx ( i.e. 2  @xmath8  2 lh pixels , or 130  pc by 130  pc )",
    ". we will refer to these apertures as the standard aperture and the small aperture , respectively .",
    "the high - resolution spectra ( 10  @xmath0m@xmath637  @xmath0 m ) for the two apertures are plotted in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "since the spectra are extracted from matched apertures , the spectral lines in both the sh and lh modules are properly calibrated and the continuum is properly matched . in figure",
    "[ zoomed ] we show in detail the 4 detected lines , with the theoretical line centers .",
    "we used smart ( spectroscopic modeling analysis and reduction tool , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) version 6.2.6 to measure line fluxes .",
    "only 4 lines were detected , the fluxes and upper limits for non - detections are presented in table  [ table1 ] . here",
    "we show the results for both the standard aperture and the small aperture .",
    "we note that the [ o  iv ] line is detected at a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath1  10 .",
    "the spectral lines for the holmberg  ii galaxy are also presented in @xcite .",
    "the focus of that paper was not the ulx in holmberg  ii , and as a result , the extraction region for the relevant spectral lines is larger than the apertures presented here .",
    "however , with this in mind , we find that our line fluxes agree reasonably well with those presented in @xcite .",
    "the sh and lh maps for the 4 detected lines are shown in figure  [ maps ] . a false - color hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ )",
    "image shows the foot nebula in h@xmath9 emission , together with the standard and small extraction apertures . because of the poor spatial resolution of the _ spitzer _ spectral maps , the emission for most lines is difficult to disentangle from the nearby star - forming regions in the foot nebula",
    "this is especially true of the low ionization lines ( [ ne  iii ] , [ s  iii ] , and [ si  ii ] ) .",
    "the morphologies of these maps indicate that the emission is likely coming from both the ulx and the surrounding star forming regions .",
    "however , while the low ionization lines [ si  ii ] and [ s  iii ] are very extended , the [ o  iv ] emission is visibly compact .",
    "the peak of the of the [ oiv ] emission is coincident with the _ chandra _ position for the ulx , with the majority of the emission concentrated in the 2@xmath82 pixel region , overlapping with the x - ray point source .",
    "there is a slight extension to the west and south that is visible on the spectral map and which may imply that the [ oiv ] emission is extended .",
    "these faint extensions correspond very well with two regions of young star formation visible in the _ hst _ image in figure  [ maps ] .",
    "kwz found that the he  ii line , which has an ionization potential just slightly lower than [ oiv ] ( 54.4  ev , compared to 54.9  ev ) , is also concentrated in a small region of 50  pc diameter around the identified optical counterpart of the ulx . because the spatial resolution is limited , a detailed comparison of our maps with the optical maps presented by kwz can not be made .",
    "however , we find that the morphology of our [ o  iv ] map appears similar to he  ii , being brighter in the east and fainter and more extended in the west .",
    "we use x - ray spectroscopy to model the x - ray emission from the ulx .",
    "we also use it to estimate the uv emission by extrapolating the model to lower energies .",
    "x - ray observations of the holmberg  ii galaxy are available from _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the ulx is in excess of 10@xmath10 erg  s@xmath11 in all observations , with the exception of a peculiar low and soft state in september 2002 , when the luminosity dropped to @xmath55@xmath810@xmath12 erg  s@xmath11 @xcite .    to model the x - ray spectrum we used the best available data from the longest ( @xmath5100  ks ) _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic pn observation in the archive ( obs .",
    "i d 0200470101 , taken on 2003 december 5 ) .",
    "the data were processed by @xcite .",
    "we used xspec version 12.4 to model the spectrum between 0.3 and 8.0 kev .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is the most important component of the total sed since it is the only observed emission that directly emanates from the ulx , and is not contaminated by the surrounding star - forming region .",
    "for this reason we have taken many precautions in modeling the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the ( far ) uv emission from the ulx is the least known , but the most important for ionization .",
    "the only available method to estimate the shape of the uv is to extrapolate from x - ray models .",
    "therefore , it is very important to find the right x - ray model to fit the data , especially in the soft x - ray band .",
    "three physically different models were used .",
    "each model contains different information about the accretion process .",
    "the first model is very basic and is widely used to model the accretion process for stellar mass black holes , ulxs and other accreting objects @xcite .",
    "the second is a modification of the first model that is more physically realistic when extrapolated to lower energies . finally , the third model is more flexible than the other two models in the uv and allows for a tighter fit in the uv while staying within the x - ray error bars .",
    "the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) x - ray luminosity is @xmath110@xmath10 erg  s@xmath11 for all models .",
    "the results from the x - ray spectral fits are listed in table  [ table2 ] , and a summary of the models is as follows :    \\1 . * power - law plus multicolor disk ( plmcd ) model : *",
    "this is a two - component model with a multi - color accretion disk component ( mcd , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a power - law for the hard tail .",
    "following kwz , the absorption column density was fixed at the galactic value of 3.42@xmath810@xmath13 @xmath14 , and an additional local absorption ( n@xmath15 ) model was added .",
    "we assume a local metallicity of 0.1  z@xmath2 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a very simplistic model commonly used to fit x - ray data for ulxs .",
    "however , the model falls apart when extrapolated to lower energies , where the power - law dominates .",
    "the extrapolation is actually physically unrealistic , since it is impossible for the disk component to comptonize lower energy photons .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the power - law component in such cases needs to have a break at low energies , in agreement with the theoretical model where the photons from the disk are up - scattered in the hot corona .",
    "moreover , if the power - law is produced by another mechanism ( e.g. a jet ) , it would not extend down to the soft uv and optical spectrum because the fluxes here would be over predicted ( see below , section  4 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the model continues to be used extensively in x - ray spectral fitting of ulxs . in conclusion",
    "this model does fit the x - ray data well ( @xmath16/dof  @xmath4  1.14 ) , but it does not make physical sense when extrapolated to lower energies .",
    "it is shown here as a base , from which alterations can be made , resulting in more physically meaningful models .",
    "the following model is one such modification to the plmcd model , and is more physically realistic when extrapolated into the uv .",
    "* modified plmcd model : * in order to isolate the intrinsic disk emission from the comptonized disk emission , we fitted the mcd and power - law separately for two different regions of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we first fitted the hard tail with a power - law .",
    "the spectrum departs from this power - law around @xmath51  kev .",
    "then we fitted an mcd model to the 0.3@xmath61.0  kev band .",
    "the disk temperature ( 0.38  kev ) is slightly higher than other published fits ( kwz obtained @xmath50.2  kev ) , because our fitting methods are slightly different . lower temperature accretion disks are generally more effective ionizing sources .",
    "therefore this higher temperature model may be viewed as a lower bound to the sed in the fuv and soft - xray bands .",
    "we note that the modified plmcd differs from the plmcd model in that the uv band is predicted from the disk component rather than the extrapolated pl component .",
    "this difference yields a much more physically realistic interpretation for the emission .",
    "* broken power - law ( bpl ) model : * finally we also fitted the x - ray spectrum to a simple broken power - law model .",
    "@xcite fit a similar model to the ulx in ngc  5408 .",
    "such a model could be explained if the emission from the companion star were comptonized by a jet @xcite .",
    "this model is much more flexible in the uv than either the plmcd or the modified plmcd models , and can predict the _ slope _ of the sed in the uv while simultaneously fitting the hard power - law component in the x - rays within the error bars of the x - ray measurements .",
    "surprisingly , this simple model provides a very good fit to the x - ray data , better than the plmcd model .",
    "the break energy is at 1.0  kev , the same energy at which we split the two components in the modified plmcd model ( 2 above ) .",
    "finally , we note that , even if this model has a power - law less steep than the plmcd model at lower energies , it is still overpredicting the soft uv and optical emission according to our photometry results ( section  4 , below ) .",
    "a similar overprediction at lower energies was found for this model by @xcite for the galactic binary xte j1550 - 564 when at high accretion rates ( in the very high state ) .      in order to constrain ulx multi - wavelength sed , we performed photometry in the ir and uv using _ spitzer _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ galex _ data .",
    "we also incorporated previously published optical and radio data from _ hst _ and the _ very large array _ ( _ vla _ ) .",
    "a short description of the data and the measurements are shown in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "all our photometric measurements were extracted from an aperture of 50  pc diameter ( 3.3@xmath7 ) .",
    "we used the optical counterpart identified by kwz to center the extraction aperture ( see fig .  [ maps ] ) .",
    "aspect correction for the ir and uv images was performed using bright sources in field , such as the foreground star seen in figure  [ maps ] .",
    "the measurements presented in table  [ table3 ] represent the integrated fluxes over this region , including the nebular emission and the contamination from other nearby sources .",
    "they should therefore be considered upper bounds to the intrinsic ulx contribution .",
    "* ir photometry : * irac and mips images ( see fig .",
    "4 ) were taken as a part of sings program  195 .",
    "we extracted 3.6  @xmath0 m and 8.0  @xmath0 m fluxes using 50  pc diameter apertures centered on the ulx position .",
    "for the mips 24  @xmath0 m photometry , we used a 100  pc extraction aperture and then divided the flux by four to obtain an approximate flux for an equivalent 50  pc aperture .",
    "we followed the standard extraction procedure and conversion factors provided in the _ irac data handbook_. the pipeline mosaics for irac and mips are accurate to within 20% .",
    "* uv photometry : * _ xmm - newton _ optical monitor ( om ) images of holmberg  ii ( fig .  4 )",
    "are available in the uvw1 band , which is centered at 2910(fwhm 620 ) .",
    "we use the mosaicked image created for the optical monitor catalog ( omcat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has an improved coordinate correction ( better than 0.5@xmath7 ) over the automated pipeline . to measure the uvw1 count rate we used the _ ximage _ software included in the _ heasoft _ package .",
    "we converted the count rate into flux using the conversion factors listed in the _ xmm - newton science analysis system user s guide_. we obtained a uvw1 magnitude of 18.42  @xmath17  0.06 , which corresponds to a luminosity of 8.3  @xmath810@xmath18 erg  s@xmath11 and a flux density of 33.1  @xmath17  0.1  @xmath0jy .",
    "the om image in figure  4 shows that the foot nebula has a strong uv emission which peaks on the ob association of stars seen in the _ hst _ image of figure  [ maps ] west of the ulx . the total uvw1 flux for this uv bright region ( including the ulx and its optical counterpart ) is equivalent to 29 o5v stars .",
    "figure  [ maps ] shows that these bright stars have apparently blown a cavity in the nw part of the nebula , thus producing the `` sole '' and the `` toes '' of the foot nebula .",
    "we note that these cavities are correlated with the faint extended [ o  iv ] emission seen in the cubism spectral maps ( fig .",
    "[ maps ] ) .",
    "the strongest emsission of h@xmath9 is however in the heel that hosts the ulx .",

    "these were calculated using the @xcite extinction curves . for the infrared data",
    ", we estimate from @xcite that the extinction is a@xmath20  0.02 , and therefore negligible .",
    "we note that the photometric fluxes presented here are likely contaminated by the surrounding nebular emission as is evidenced by the _ hst _",
    "images in figure  [ maps ] .",
    "moreover , kwz caution that the local extinction could in fact occur very close to the compact object and therefore not affect our measurements at all .",
    "we will therefore take the ( extinction - corrected ) photometric measurements as upper bounds .",
    "while the mcd accretion disk model is a good approximation of the uv continuum to first order , it does not account for self - irradiation of x - ray photons caused by thickening of the accretion disk at the outer edges and relativistic effects on the x - rays emitted from the inner regions of the disk . in galactic x - ray binaries ,",
    "this reflected radiation has been shown to increase the optical luminosity of the accretion disk by as much as 18% @xcite .",
    "thus if irradiation were contaminating the uv emission in the holmberg ii ulx , such a model must be included in the final fit .",
    "we therefore checked to see if x - ray irradiation would affect the ionizing uv emission from the holmberg  ii ulx , or contribute significantly to the flux of the optical counterpart .",
    "following @xcite , we modeled the expected sed of an irradiated disk for black holes of mass 10 , 100 and 1000  m@xmath21 and with varying accretion disk radii . here the accretion disk radius is constrained by the size of the roche lobe , and is therefore dependent on the spectral type of the companion star .",
    "we find that for stellar mass black holes , irradiation affects the accretion disk model significantly for most companion spectral types .",
    "however , for intermediate black hole masses , irradiation is only important to systems with late - type supergiant companions .    in figure  5",
    "two examples of irradiated spectra are plotted .",
    "these represent typical spectra for stellar - mass bhs ( 10  m@xmath21 ) and imbhs ( 1000  m@xmath21 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "an accretion disk typical for a system with an m - supergiant was used to illustrate the effect of irradiation .",
    "only if the imbh has such companions is the self - irradiation effect significant .",
    "however , we note that an m - supergiant companion is not consistent with the observations for the ulx in holmberg ii ( see section  4 below ) . as can be seen from this plot , in both cases the irradiation dominates the optical and near - ir spectrum much more than the uv band .",
    "thus we conclude that while irradiation may be important to model in the optical spectrum of a system with a stellar mass black hole , it is likely not dominant for an imbh system .",
    "finally we conclude that the irradiation does not affect the detected ir lines . moreover , because the measured fluxes are much higher than the predictions from the accretion disk , self - irradiation is not likely to make a significant contribution to our measured fluxes at any wavelength .",
    "using the measurements and the x - ray models in section  2 , we construct the sed of the ulx using the ir , optical , uv and x - ray photometric measurements .",
    "the final sed is plotted with the continuous black line in figure  6 .",
    "all photometric measurements described in the previous section were extracted from an aperture of @xmath550  pc centered on the ulx ( fig .",

    "we found that both x - ray models that have power - law components extending to lower energies ( plmcd and bpl ) , over - predict the measured fluxes if extrapolated into uv and optical .",
    "therefore we use the modified plmcd model to extrapolate the x - ray spectrum to lower energies . here",

    "* ) , since this extrapolated disk component is a superposition of numerous black bodies representing the integrated emission from the disk at the various temperatures and radii . at optical energies , this model predicts a drop in flux due to the finite size of the accretion disk ( see fig .  5 ) .    * optical band : *",
    "the disk model was further extrapolated into the optical , where the companion star dominates the sed .",

    "in section  4 and figure  6 we constructed the full sed for the holmberg  ii ulx using multi - wavelength data and previously published data .",
    "the bolometric luminosity for this sed is 1.34@xmath810@xmath10 erg  s@xmath11 , when the far - uv spectrum is extrapolated from the x - rays , using the modified plmcd model fit .",
    "table  2 illustrates the degeneracy resulting from the three methods for x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "all three show a fairly good fit to the x - ray data , making it very difficult to distinguish between the different physical interpretations that each model represents .",
    "the optical and uv fluxes plotted in figure  6 can , in principle , come from three different sources : the stellar companion , the accretion disk , and from a jet .",
    "however , the overall sed shape and in particular the fact that the optical flux is much lower than the uv fluxes , disfavor the jet scenario as discussed below . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission from the disk in the modified plmcd model is too faint at optical and uv wavelengths if extrapolated from x - rays and requires an additional source .",
    "previously published optical data and our uv measurements suggest that a @xmath5b2ib star is the source of these fluxes as the companion to the accreting bh .",
    "we explore this further in paper  2 .    the fact that the plmcd model overpredicts the uv and optical fluxes if extrapolated to these wavelengths",
    "is expected , because the power - law can not extend too much below the peak of the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is intriguing that the simple broken power - law model ( bpl ) provides such a good fit to the high - quality x - ray data .",
    "moreover , the location of the break ( @xmath51  kev ) in this case is in agreement with the jet model .",
    "@xcite fit a very similar model to another famous ulx in ngc  5408 .",
    "it has been shown that jets can contribute significantly to the x - ray emission , both by optically thin synchrotron emission and compton scattering of the photons from the disk ( or the companion ) by relativistic electrons in the jet @xcite . however , even if the power - law is less steep compared to the plmcd model , it is still overpredicting the uv and optical fluxes and is therefore not the preferred scenario .",
    "much better constraints are provided by photoionization modeling of the _ spitzer _ spectra . the [ o  iv ] line is only produced by high energy photons ( @xmath23  54  ev ) , and is clearly associated with the ulx ( fig .",
    "[ maps ] ) .",
    "for instance , the `` classical '' plmcd model predicts a power - law component with photon index of 2.4 dominating into the uv .",
    "this model has the strongest emission of the three models in the far uv and soft x - rays , and should produce the strongest [ o  iv ] emission . in this case , photoionization modeling can be used to predict the [ o  iv ] flux predicted from such a model , and this predicted flux can be compared with our observed values . in a companion paper ( paper",
    "2 ) we present the results of such a photoionization analysis in an attempt to distinguish between the three x - ray models presented here .",
    "the ionization potential of [ o  iv ] is just above the he  ii edge so both likely result from similar regions in the nebula and a quantitative comparison between previously published optical observations and the mid - ir observations can be made .",
    "kwz found that the he  ii recombination line is consistent with photoionization by the ulx .",
    "the flux of our [ o  iv ] line is almost three times higher than the he  ii flux measured by kwz ( 2.7  @xmath8  10@xmath24 erg  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "we compared the mid - ir line ratios of the ulx with those in agn .",
    "ngc  4395 is one of the few known galaxies that is likely powered by an imbh @xcite .",
    "it has a bolometric luminosity very close to our ulx , and high - excitation emission lines were detected .",
    "the narrow - line he  ii measured by @xcite for ngc  4395 relative to h@xmath25 is 0.12 , a value typical for seyfert1 galaxies @xcite . for the holmberg  ii ulx , he  ii / h@xmath26  0.2 ( kwz ) ; slightly higher than for ngc  4395 .",
    "the [ o  iv ] measured from ngc  4395 is almost 16 times larger than the he  ii flux @xcite .",
    "however , the gas density is close to the critical density for this line ( 10@xmath27  @xmath28 ) @xmath6 much higher than the density of the gas surrounding the holmberg  ii ulx ( kwz estimate 10  @xmath28 , based on the line surface brightness predicted with cloudy ) .",
    "the [ o  iv ] is expected to increase as it approaches the critical density , while the he  ii is not sensitive to the gas density .",
    "an even more important difference is the abundance of o , which is @xmath5  5 times higher for ngc  4395 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the [ o  iv ] on the abundance is expected to be roughly linear . in spite of these two differences",
    ", we consider the [ o  iv ] ( and he  ii ) detected from the holmberg  ii ulx to be consistent with photoionization by a high energy source similar to the agn in ngc  4395 .",
    "the infrared [ o  iv ] line ( together with [ ne  v ] ) is a signature of high ionization usually associated with actively accreting black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this line is often used to disentangle the starburst emission in composite type galaxies , and is a good indicator of the agn power @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have used the ratio of [ o  iv]/[ne  ii ] to distinguish between starbursts and agn dominated galaxies in the mid - ir . in figure  [ ratios]a we compare the holmberg  ii ulx with data published by @xcite .",
    "the comparison clearly indicate high ionization for the ulx , similar to agn .",
    "other infrared line diagnostics have been proposed by @xcite to disentangle agn type ionizing sources from star formation , using the ratios [ s  iii ] 33.48  @xmath0 m / [ si  ii ] 34.82  @xmath0 m and [ ne  iii ] / [ ne  ii ] .",
    "figure  [ ratios]b shows the four regions defined by @xcite in their figure  5 , and their published data for different sources in the sings sample .",
    "the holmberg  ii ulx is located well within region i , together with most agns and liners .",
    "both diagnostic diagrams suggest that the [ o  iv ] emission in holmberg  ii is dominated by the ulx and that the surrounding star forming regions provide little contamination to this line .",
    "while this comparison provides good evidence that the line ratios for the ulx are very similar to agn , we note that agn are different than ulxs , both in their intrinsic emission and their environment . for example , agn emit copiously in the uv and optical , and are surrounded by gas at high densities .",
    "@xcite found a good correlation between the luminosity of the [ o  iv ] line and the mass of the central bh in standard agn .",
    "we estimate a bh mass of 3.5@xmath810@xmath29  m@xmath21 if this correlation is extrapolated to the holmberg  ii ulx .",
    "we can also estimate the bh mass using the inner disk temperature from the modified plmcd model ( 0.38  kev ) .",
    "we obtain a bh mass of 994  m@xmath2 .",
    "however , the flux of the mcd disk component does not dominate the x - ray emission ( is only 49% of the total flux ) .",
    "this scenario would imply that the ulx is not in a typical high state , and therefore the inner disk temperature can not be used reliably to estimate the mass of the bh @xcite . finally , using the bolometric luminosity calculated from our sed ( 1.34  @xmath8  10@xmath10 erg  s@xmath11 ) , we estimate that the lower limit to the mass of the central bh , within the eddington regime , is 85  m@xmath2 .",
    "the detection of the [ o  iv ] line from the holmberg  ii ulx indicates strong uv and soft x - ray emission .",
    "this line is commonly used to quantify the agn power in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the ratios of this line to lower - ionization lines are comparable to those in agns and suggest that the [ oiv ] emission in holmberg  ii results from the ulx and not from the surrounding star forming regions .",
    "the mid - ir line ratios indicate that the intrinsic luminosity of the ulx must be very high .",
    "the sed constructed based on the x - ray spectral modeling , uv and infrared photometry , and previously published radio and optical data suggest that the ulx companion is likely similar to a b2ib supergiant . the accretion disk is not expected to contribute very much in the optical .",
    "the overall shape of the sed seems to favor the accretion disk emission as the dominant component in the soft x - ray and far uv , and is therefore likely responsible for the photoionization . in the accompanying paper ( paper  2 )",
    "we perform detailed photoionization modeling to provide further evidence that the detected [ o  iv ] line is consistent with the ionizing emission from the ulx , and to better constrain the three x - ray models presented here .    c. t. b. is grateful to lisa winter for allowing us to use the processed _ xmm - newton _ data .",
