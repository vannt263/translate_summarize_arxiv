    "the classical plateau problem is the problem of finding a surface minimizing the area amongst all surfaces which are images of a map from a disk and spanning a given jordan curve .",
    "we can formulate this problem more precisely as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be the unit disk in @xmath2 .",
    "the area of a map @xmath3 is @xmath4 * the classical plateau problem . * _ given a jordan curve @xmath5 , let @xmath6 find @xmath7 so that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 . _ +   + the classical plateau problem can be solved by finding a map @xmath10 which is conformal and harmonic .",
    "the study of classical minimal surfaces via harmonic maps is now well developed , starting with the solution of this problem by j.douglas  @xcite in the 1930 s .",
    "our interest in this paper is a singular version of this problem . in  @xcite",
    ", we investigated properties of 1-dimensional ( 2-dimensional resp . )",
    "subsets of a euclidean space which minimize length ( area resp . ) amongst all the sets sharing a certain boundary set . due to the shape of the boundary set ,",
    "the minimizer is not a curve ( surface resp . ) but a union of curves ( surfaces resp . ) .",
    "a variational formulation of this problem was presented in  @xcite as a minimization problem for a certain energy functional of maps from a suitable polyhedral domain ( or a finite complex ) . continuing the study of the two dimensional version of the problem",
    ", we refer to a singular surface as a union of the images of three maps , each from a disk joined along a curve @xmath11 and bounding a graph @xmath12 as pictured below .",
    "the boundary set @xmath12 in this picture is the graph consisting of three edges meeting at two vertices , and the curve @xmath11 is the set where three disk - type surfaces are meeting . in the singular plateau problem",
    ", we look for a singular surface which minimizes area amongst all other singular surfaces bounding the given graph @xmath12 . +        in order to capture the area - minimizer as an energy - minimizer in our singular setting where several ( three ) energy functionals are being minimized concurrently , we introduced in  @xcite a weighted @xmath13-energy .",
    "as the name suggests , this functional is a quadratic combination of dirichlet energies with respect to some weights .",
    "its minimizer in the spaces of maps , weights , and conformal structures / glueing maps is shown to be the area minimizer .",
    "furthermore , the minimizing map is harmonic and weakly conformal .",
    "the extension of the classical harmonic map theory to singular spaces was initiated by work of gromov - schoen @xcite and also korevaar - schoen @xcite , @xcite where singular target spaces are considered .",
    "the study of harmonic maps from a polyhedral space is considered in j. chen @xcite , eells - fuglede @xcite , fuglede @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and daskalopoulos - mese @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the use of the energy functional in singular minimal surface theory is a natural application of the singular harmonic map theory .    the best known singular surface minimizing the area is probably the @xmath14-minimal sets in @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "j.taylor  @xcite showed that in the interior of a @xmath14-minimal set , there are only two types of singularities .",
    "one is the * y*-type , characterized by three minimal surfaces meeting at @xmath16 degrees along a @xmath17 curve ( which we will call a free boundary ) .",
    "the other is the * t*-type , characterized by four of those free boundary curves meeting at a vertex , whose tangent cone is the cone over the regular tetrahedron and each free boundary is @xmath18 up to the vertex point ( @xmath19 ) . in  @xcite",
    ", we attempted to construct the singular configuration of three surfaces meeting along a free boundary as an image of a harmonic map from a simplicial complex .",
    "the key technical aspect in this approach is that there is an infinite dimensional moduli space @xmath20 of conformal structures defined on the domain complex which is homeomorphic to three standard 2-simplices glued along a common 1-simplex . here",
    "the infinite dimensionality is caused by the different ways of glueing the three copies of the 2-simplices .",
    "the fact that the free boundary is real analytic in the @xmath21-minimal setting suggests that the gluing maps one needs to consider for a minimizing element is smooth .",
    "the first result ( theorem  [ kreg ] ) in this paper is that when the conformal structure of a minimizing element of our variational problem is induced by a @xmath22-smooth gluing map of 2-simplices , then the minimal singular surface has real analytic free boundary .",
    "it is an a - priori estimate , not unlike the result of kinderlehrer - nirenberg - spruck  @xcite , in the sense that given a minimal configuration of a variational problem with a sufficient regularity , then the actual regularity is much better .",
    "recall that @xcite proves that the area minimizing singular surfaces of * y*-type in @xmath15 which was shown to be @xmath17 by @xcite is in fact real analytic .",
    "the phenomena is accounted by the general principle of lopatinski - shapiro s , where an elliptic system of partial differential equations satisfies a coercive boundary condition .    in order to set up our variational formulation according to this principle",
    ", we define a weighted @xmath23-functional of the dirichlet energies .",
    "we show ( lemma  [ k - min / c - min ] ) that minimizing the @xmath23-energy is equivalent to minimizing the @xmath13-energy .",
    "the @xmath23-energy minimizer satisfies the matching and balancing conditions ( explained more precisely below , see ( [ mf ] ) and ( [ bf ] ) ) at the free boundary .",
    "this can be recognized as the coercive boundary condition in the sense of lopatinski - shapiro .",
    "having established the real analyticity of the free boundary , we geometrically characterize the image of the minimizing map . where the map is non - degenerate , namely away from the set @xmath24 of isolated branch points , the image is locally either an embedded minimal surface or a union of three minimal surfaces meeting along a real analytic curve at @xmath25 angle ( theorem  [ three ] ) .",
    "note that this is consistent with the description of @xmath14-minimal surface by  @xcite .",
    "near a point on the free boundary parameterized by the non - degenerate map , the real analyticity of the three surface meeting along the real analytic free boundary is used to show that each of the induced conformal structures on the three minimal surfaces can be locally uniformized by a half disk , with a matching parameterization of the free boundary .",
    "this in turn says that there is a conformal ( and harmonic ) map locally defined on the unit ball ( denoted @xmath26 ) about the vertex of the tangent cone at a point of the singular point .",
    "thus we establish a local uniformization ( theorem  [ isothermal ] ) of the minimal singular surface away from the branch points .    note that if the minimal surface is non - singular , this is nothing but the existence of an isothermal coordinate system . the important difference in the two characterizations of minimal surfaces via a conformal harmonic map is that in the classical plateau problem case , the parameterization is of the entire disk - type minimal surface , while in the singular case we only assert the existence of a neighborhood of a * y*-type singular point conformally equivalent to @xmath26 .",
    "this is because any two disk - type surfaces are conformally equivalent by the uniformization theorem which has no analog in the singular setting . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the key observation contained in this paper and @xcite is that _ locally there is only one conformal structure _",
    "@xmath26 to the singular surfaces while _ globally there are many",
    "_ , parameterized by the infinite dimensional space @xmath20 .",
    "we further note that the conformal structure @xmath26 is conformally equivalent to the trivial element @xmath27 ( where the glueing via the identity map ) of @xmath20 .    the existence of an isothermal coordinate system for the minimizer of our variational problem is closely related to the real analytic extension of each surface across the free boundary .",
    "the real analytic extension of a minimal surface across a real analytic boundary curve is a celebrated result by h.lewy  @xcite in the 50 s .",
    "the key to his proof is schwarz reflection principle of holomorphic function . having the isothermal",
    "coordinate system around a * y*-type singular point of the image of our minimizer , we construct the extension ( theorem  [ reflection ] ) of one surface via a weighted averaging of the harmonic maps parameterizing the three surfaces .",
    "we call this construction multi - sheeted reflection .",
    "the averaging works due to the important fact that one can regard these parameterizations as a _ multi - valued harmonic function _ defined on a half - disk and hence taking linear combinations preserves harmonicity .",
    "furthermore when the ambient space is @xmath15 , the matching and the balancing conditions of the three minimal surfaces along a real analytic free boundary give an overdetermined boundary condition .",
    "indeed one can construct the configuration from a single minimal surface with a real analytic boundary with the use of bjling s method . in this way",
    ", we provide an alternative expression ( theorem  [ lewy ] ) for the extended surface across the boundary curve .",
    "_ acknowledgement .",
