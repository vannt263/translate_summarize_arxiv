    "with the recent detection of polarization in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ; @xcite ) , and the detection of the temperature - polarization cross correlation by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ )  @xcite , the immediate goal for upcoming polarization experiments is to map accurately the polarization power spectra over a wide range of angular scales .",
    "cmb polarization is generated at last scattering from the local quadrupole moment of the photon total intensity .",
    "the expected r.m.s .  polarization is @xmath3 , peaking around an angular scale of @xmath4 ( the angle subtended by the width of the last scattering surface ) , making mapping a challenging prospect .",
    "further scattering once the universe reionizes tends to destroy polarization on scales that are then sub - hubble , but generates additional large - angle polarization  @xcite .",
    "the potential cosmological returns from polarization observations are high .",
    "current polarization data  @xcite already allows a stringent test to be made of the paradigm for structure formation from initially super - hubble , passive , adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the detection by _ wmap _ of large - scale power in the temperature - polarization cross power spectrum has provided new constraints on the reionization process , and helped lift major degeneracies that affect the determination of cosmological parameters from the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "( in particular , the degeneracies between reionization optical depth and the scalar spectral index and gravitational wave amplitude . )",
    "potential returns from future , more precise , observations include ( i ) detection of the clean signature of a stochastic background of gravitational waves  @xcite and hence fine selection between inflation models  @xcite ; and ( ii ) evidence for weak gravitational lensing through the distortion of cmb polarization on small scales  @xcite .",
    "estimating the polarization power spectra is an important intermediate step in achieving these science goals .",
    "this paper addresses that problem , presenting a fast , robust method for estimating the power spectra from large datasets in the presence of real - world complications , such as incomplete sky coverage and inhomogeneous noise .",
    "the accurate analysis of cmb data places strong demands on the statistical methods employed . even for total intensity data , which is simpler than polarization ,",
    "the extraction of the power spectrum from upcoming mega - pixel datasets with standard maximum - likelihood methods ( e.g.  @xcite ) is beyond the range of any supercomputer .",
    "[ the operations count scales as the number of pixels cubed , @xmath5 , while the storage requirements are @xmath6 . ] in the search for fast alternatives to brute - force maximum - likelihood power spectrum estimation , two broad approaches have emerged . in the first",
    ", experiment - specific symmetries are exploited to make the brute - force analysis tractable , or , if the symmetries are only approximate , to pre - condition an iterative solution to the likelihood maximisation .",
    "an example of the former is the ingenious `` ring - torus '' method of  @xcite , while the latter was pioneered by  @xcite during the development of the pipeline for the _ wmap _ satellite .",
    "the second class of methods sacrifice optimality in favour of speed by adopting a more heuristic weighting of the data ( such as inverse weighting with the noise variance ) .",
    "an estimate of the underlying power spectrum is then obtained from the raw , rotationally - invariant power spectrum of the weighted map ( the pseudo-@xmath7s ; @xcite ) either by a direct linear inversion  @xcite or with likelihood methods ( wandelt et al .  2001 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the linear inversion , which yields estimators quadratic in the data , can be performed directly in harmonic space  @xcite , or , more simply , by first transforming to real space ( i.e.  by constructing the correlation function ) and then recovering the power spectrum with a ( suitably apodized ) integral transform  @xcite .",
    "the estimation of polarization power spectra is less well explored than for total intensity , although all of the above methods can , in principle , be extended to handle polarization . to date , only brute - force maximum likelihood  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* munshi et al . in preparation ) , minimum - variance quadratic estimators  @xcite , pseudo-@xmath7 methods with statistical  @xcite or direct inversion  @xcite in harmonic space , and real - space correlation function methods  @xcite have been demonstrated on polarized data . of these ,",
    "only the pseudo-@xmath7 methods are fast enough to apply many times ( e.g.  in monte - carlo simulations ) to mega - pixel maps . in this paper",
    "we extend the fast correlation - function approach of  @xcite to polarized data .",
    "a new problem that arises when analysing polarized data , that is absent for total intensity , is the decomposition of the polarized field into its electric ( @xmath1 ; sometimes denoted gradient ) and magnetic ( @xmath2 ; alternatively curl ) components .",
    "the scientific importance of this decomposition is that primordial magnetic polarization is not generated by density perturbations , and so in standard models is sourced only by gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "however , with incomplete sky coverage , separating the polarization field into electric and magnetic components is no longer straightforward .",
    "exquisite monitoring of leakage between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in analysis pipelines will be required if primordial @xmath2 polarization is to be detected down to the fundamental confusion limit set by cosmic shear  @xcite .",
    "the question of performing the @xmath1-@xmath2 separation on an incomplete sky has received considerable attention recently  @xcite .",
    "methods are now available for extracting pure measures of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 _ fields _ which can then be used for subsequent power spectrum estimation .",
    "an alternative approach is to perform a joint ( i.e.  @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) power spectrum analysis of the original polarization data , removing the need for an additional stage in the analysis pipeline and the non - optimalities that this may introduce .",
    "the efficacy of maximum - likelihood methods for performing the @xmath1-@xmath2 separation is explored by munshi et al .",
    "( in preparation )",
    ". however , the computational demands of likelihood methods , and the difficulty in monitoring @xmath1-@xmath2 leakage in a non - linear analysis , motivates the development of fast , unbiased methods .",
    "the correlation - function based approach we develop here , motivated by  @xcite , has a significant feature in that , with a little post - processing of the correlation functions , leakage between @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be eliminated in the mean , even for observations covering only a small part of the sky .",

    "of course , a lower level of @xmath2-mode polarization would increase the relative significance of the cross - contribution .",
    "ultimately , this cross - contamination may make our method unsuitable for future , high - sensitivity @xmath2-mode experiments surveying small regions if the tensor amplitude is too low .",
    "we leave quantification of this statement to a future paper ( challinor & chon in preparation ) , where we show how to estimate the cross - contribution to the variance for non - symmetric weight functions .",
    "since full covariance information is available from equation  ( [ eq : newmoderror ] ) , the level of correlation between adjacent band - powers can be calculated directly .",
    "for the bicep scan strategy , @xmath299 oscillates with a full - width at half - maximum of approximately 12 .",
    "hence , for the chosen bin width @xmath278 , the correlation between adjacent bins is negligible .",
    "we presented a fast and unbiased method to extract cmb polarization power spectra from large maps via the two - point correlation functions .",
    "the method , which generalises that of  @xcite to polarization , can be summarised as follows .",
    "first , we compute unbiased estimates of the three ( complex ) polarization auto- and cross - correlation functions at the roots of a legendre polynomial from pseudo-@xmath7s of heuristically - weighted maps .",
    "the estimates of the correlation functions can be computed in @xmath0 operations using fast spherical transforms .",
    "if the correlation functions can be estimated for all angular separations , the power spectra can be accurately recovered with gauss - legendre integration . in this case , the method is unbiased : the theoretical window function is a kronecker delta .",
    "further compression to band - powers can then be made , and the resulting theoretical window functions would be top - hat functions . if the correlation functions can not be estimated for all angular separations , due to limitations of sky coverage , we showed that significant @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing can occur . in particular , large - scale @xmath1 power ( due to reionization )",
    "can be aliased into @xmath2 on all scales .",
    "although @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing does not present a fundamental problem for parameter extraction , it does complicate the interpretation ( and presentation ) of the recovered power spectra .",
    "for this reason , we proposed a new estimator , extending earlier work by  @xcite , that removes @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing exactly in the mean when working with incomplete correlation functions .",
    "note that this is not the case for regularised inversions of the pseudo-@xmath7s in harmonic space ( e.g.  by working with pseudo band powers as in a polarized extension of master ; @xcite ) .",
    "the new estimator requires one further numerical integration of the estimated correlation function @xmath300 to obtain functions that contain only @xmath1 or @xmath2 power in the mean . using e.g.  a cumulative simpson rule ,",
    "these functions can be estimated accurately at the roots of a legendre polynomial and inverted to power spectra with gauss - legendre quadrature .",
    "the increase in computational effort is minimal , and the theoretical window functions that result do not couple @xmath1 and @xmath2 power in the mean by construction .",
    "fourier ringing in the estimates can be safely controlled by apodizing the integral transforms ( or by compressing into band - powers ) , without introducing any @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing .",
    "an essential part of our method ( and indeed any quadratic method ) is being able to remove the mean noise contribution from the correlation functions ( i.e.  to remove the bias due to the noise ) . for general noise properties we must resort to monte - carlo evaluation of the mean over an ensemble of pure noise realisations .",
    "the method presented here is thus dependent on being able to simulate noise maps efficiently .",
    "error estimation on the recovered @xmath7s must also generally proceed by monte - carlo evaluation .",
    "the @xmath0 scaling of our method makes this a realistic proposition , even for mega - pixel maps .",
    "we applied our methods to simulations of a large - area survey , with parameters similar to _ planck _ , and also to the bicep experiment which will cover 3 per cent of the sky . in both cases we obtained errors in line with theoretical expectations .",
    "although our algorithm in its present form is already practical for analysing mega - pixel cmb maps , further work is required to assess the optimality of the underlying methods .",
    "in particular , comparison with current ( brute - force ) maximum - likelihood codes should be possible for low - resolution simulations ; comparison at higher resolution must await further algorithmic development of the likelihood codes .",
    "another issue worth investigating further is the impact of the choice of pixel weighting on the cosmic variance contribution from e.g.  @xmath113 to the recovered @xmath114 .",
    "although we have separated @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the mean , this does not guarantee that in a single realisation there is no recovered @xmath2 power due to @xmath1 modes in the signal .",
    "we have shown that this geometric effect does not dominate the error budget for @xmath114 for the bicep weight function , in the absence of noise , for a tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath13 . however , ultimately this cross - contribution may limit the applicability of our method if the tensor amplitude is low enough ( challinor & chon in preparation ) . to eliminate this undesirable contribution to",
