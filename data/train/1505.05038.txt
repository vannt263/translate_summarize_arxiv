    "production of heavy quarks is of substantial and ongoing interest in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "this statement had not changed in nearly 40 years , when the charm and bottom flavoured particles were discovered .",
    "the energy scale for the production of charm and bottom quarks is significantly higher than the typical quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) scale , @xmath7 gev .",
    "this gives the value of strong coupling of the order of @xmath8 , which is small enough to apply perturbative qcd techniques . at the present level of knowledge and current experimental abilities ,",
    "heavy flavours are known as one of the best testing grounds of the theory of hard qcd interactions .",
    "theoretical analyses of charm and bottom cross sections in proton - proton interactions provide an unique precision tool in this context . due to their mass ,",
    "heavy quarks are also belived to be a special probe of the medium created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "since heavy quarks are only produced in the initial stage of the heavy ion collisions , heavy quark distributions from proton - proton interactions supply a well defined initial state .",
    "their further propagation through the hot and dense medium probes its interesting characteristics .",
    "measurements of charm and bottom cross sections at hadron colliders can be performed in the so - called indirect way .",
    "this method is based on measurement of leptons from semileptonic decays of open charm and bottom mesons , which are often called non - photonic .",
    "the semileptonic decay modes allow for an indirect measurement of the d and b meson cross sections and by further extrapolation the charm and bottom quark cross sections .",
    "the indirect methodologies to measure non - photonic electrons / muons have been used since the early 1970 s @xcite .",
    "the decay of hadrons by the weak interaction can be viewed as a process of decay of their constituent quarks .",
    "the charm and bottom flavours are not preserved in weak interactions , so their weak decays are possible . within",
    "the semileptonic decays , the allowed ( according to electric charge conservation ) transitions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are involved by the emission of charged @xmath11 boson , which further creates a lepton and the corresponding antineutrino @xmath12 .",
    "the semileptonic decay widths are proportional to the square of the appropriate elements of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix @xcite , which contains information on the strength of flavour - changing weak decays .",
    "the decays within the same quark generation are strongly favoured over decays between generations .",
    "main virtues of the semileptonic modes come from the fact that they have bigger branching fractions than the hadronic @xmath4 meson decay channels . moreover , in the former the effects of strong interactions can be isolated and thus they are better accessible experimentally .",
    "in addition , direct lepton production through weak and electromagnetic interactions in hadronic collisions is suppressed relative to the strong interaction by twelve and four orders of magnitude , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , electrons and muons are certainly not rare paticles because they are abundantly produced in light hadron decays . these rather problematic background must be accounted for and eliminated through experimental techniques .",
    "if the primary sources of background are well understood and substracted , the remaining events can then be attributed to the heavy flavour signal .",
    "another method for experimental investigation of charm and bottom quark production at hadron colliders is the direct procedure based on full reconstruction of all decay products of open charm and bottom mesons , for instance in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 channels .",
    "the hadronic decay products can be used to built invariant mass distributions , permitting direct observation of @xmath4 or @xmath5 meson as a peak in the experimental invariant mass spectrum .",
    "open charm @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons are characterized by rather long lifetimes , of the order of @xmath16 and @xmath17 seconds , respecitvely .",
    "charm and bottom quarks decay essentially at the collision vertex , while heavy flavour mesons decay from a secondary vertex offset by the boosted lifetime of the paticle . in the direct approach the charm and bottom contributions can be well separated , which is not the case in the indirect method . in the latter case",
    ", it can be achieved only within the analysis of lepton - meson ( e.g. @xmath18-@xmath4 ) correlations @xcite , which are easily available e.g. in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "the star and phenix collaborations have measured transverse momentum distributions of electrons coming from the semileptonic decays of heavy flavoured hadrons in proton - proton scattering at the rhic energy @xmath1 gev with lepton transverse momenta up to @xmath19 gev in the midrapidity region @xcite .",
    "in addition , the star collaboration was able to separate the charm and bottom contributions to the spectra of heavy flavour electrons @xcite .",
    "the phenix collaboration has also measured non - photonic dilepton invariant mass spectrum from @xmath3 to @xmath20 gev in proton - proton collisions at @xmath21 gev @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the cross sections for inclusive production of the non - photonic electrons at rhic have been studied theoretically up to the next - to - leading order pqcd collinear approximation within the fonll approach in ref .",
    "the first theoretical investigation within the competitive qcd @xmath0-factorization framework was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , including more exclusive studies of kinematical correlations .    very recently , the star collaboration measured for the first time transverse momentum spectra of @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons up to @xmath24 gev at @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 gev @xcite in proton - proton collisions .",
    "before , studies of charm production at rhic through hadronic decay channels were performed only in cu - cu collisions @xcite and in proton - proton scattering but for @xmath22 mesons produced in jets @xcite . up to now , the new star proton - proton data on open charm production were studied only in the context of high energy pa collisions in the color glass condensate framework with the unintegrated gluon densities from the solution of rcbk equation @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to make first theoretical analysis of the measured hadron - level charm differential cross section within the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "the open charm meson data allow us to make more direct comparison of the theoretical predictions and rhic experimental results on heavy flavour production without including additional step related to the semileptonic decays .",
    "recently , the formalism of the @xmath0-factorization approach has been found to give very good description of open charm @xcite and bottom @xcite production rates and kinematical correlations in proton - proton scattering at @xmath25 tev measured by the alice , atlas , cms and lhcb experiments .",
    "however , a significant sensitivity of theoretical predictions on the model of unintegrated ( transverse momentum dependent ) gluon distributions ( ugdfs ) used in calculations has been also reported .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to make similar study for the star experimental data on open heavy flavour production at @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev .",
    "this may be a good test of different models of ugdfs in the rhic kinematical regime where one can probe parton ( gluon ) distributons at intermediate longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath26 . here",
    ", we wish to pay particular attention on ugdf models favoured by the lhc data and on a new up - to - date parametrizations based on the hera collider dis high - precision data .",
    "the present study is an important extension of our previous paper , where charm and bottom cross section at rhic has been considered in the context of semileptonic decays of open heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "precise predictions for charmed mesons may also shed new light on the theoretical understanding of non - photonic lepton production at rhic .",
    "our previous studies of these processes within the @xmath0-factorization approach were based on rather older models of ugdfs which may be the reason of the reported missing strength in description of the rhic experimental data .",
    "similar problem was also noticed within the nlo collinear calculations in the fonll model , where only upper limits of the theoretical predictions are consistent with the relevant star and phenix data @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following paper we will also revise theoretical cross sections of the non - photonic lepton production at rhic wihtin the @xmath0-factorizaton approach , taking as a reference point the results obtained in the analysis of the new hadron - level star data . in the following calculation , except of updated ugdfs , we also take into account the effect of transformation of semileptonic decay functions between laboratory ( @xmath27 center - of - mass system ) and rest frames of decaying @xmath4 or @xmath5 mesons .",
    "several different mechanisms play a role in heavy quark hadroproduction . in general , in the framework of qcd there are two types of the @xmath28 leading - order ( lo ) @xmath29 subprocesses : @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite , often referred to as heavy quark - antiquark pair creation .",
    "the first mechanism , @xmath32-annihilation , is important only near the threshold and at very large invariant masses of @xmath33 system or extremely forward rapidities .",
    "this contribution is therefore especially important in the case of top quark production , however , for charm and bottom production , starting from rhic , through tevatron , up to the lhc it can be safely neglected . at high energies ,",
    "production of charm and bottom flavours is dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion , which is the starting point of the following analysis . in the case of heavy quark production the @xmath34 next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative contributions",
    "have been found to be of special importance ( see e.g. @xcite ) and have to be included in order to describe the heavy flavour high energy experimental data .    the qed contributions , with one or two photons initiated reactions , such as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 have been carefully studied in ref .",
    "@xcite together with other sub - leading contributions to production of charm and were found to be negligibly small at high energies .    in the following ,",
    "the cross sections for charm and bottom quark production in proton - proton collisions are calculated in the framework of the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "this framework has been successfully applied for different high energy processes , including heavy quark production ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . according to this approach ,",
    "the transverse momenta @xmath6 s ( virtualities ) of partons which initiate reaction are taken into account and the sum of transverse momenta of the final @xmath38 and @xmath39 no longer cancels .",
    "then the lo differential cross section for the @xmath40 pair production reads : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the ugdfs for the both colliding hadrons .",
    "the extra integration is over transverse momenta of the initial partons .",
    "explicit treatment of the transverse part of momenta makes the approach very efficient in studies of correlation observables .",
    "the two - dimensional dirac delta function assures momentum conservation .",
    "the unintegrated ( transverse momentum dependent ) gluon distributions must be evaluated at : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the quark / antiquark transverse mass . in the case of heavy quark production at rhic energies , especially in the central rapidity region , one test kinematical regime of @xmath46 .",
    "the lo matrix element squared for off - shell gluons is taken in the analytic form proposed by catani , ciafaloni and hautmann ( cch ) @xcite .",
    "this analytic formula was basically derived within the standard qcd framework and can be adopted to the numerical analyses .",
    "it was also checked that the cch expression is consistent with those presented later in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the limit of @xmath47 , @xmath48 it converges to the on - shell formula .",
    "the calculation of higher - order corrections in the @xmath0-factorization is much more complicated than in the case of collinear approximation .",
    "however , the common statement is that actually in the @xmath6-factorization approach with lo off - shell matrix elements some part of higher - order corrections is effectively included .",
    "this is due to emission of extra gluons encoded in the unintegrated gluon densities .",
    "more details of the theoretical formalism adopted here can be found in ref.@xcite .    in the numerical calculation below we have applied several unintegrated gluon densities which are based on different theoretical assumptions .",
    "the kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) ugdf is derived from a modified dglap - bfkl evolution equation @xcite and has been found recently to work very well in the case of charm and bottom production at the lhc .",
    "a special emphasis here is put on the ugdf models obtained as a solution of ccfm evolution equation . here",
    "we use an older jung set@xmath49 parametrization @xcite and up - to - date jh2013 distributions @xcite determined from the fits to hera high - precision dis measurements .",
    "the jh2013 set1 is obtained from the fit to inclusive @xmath50 data only while jh2013 set2 is derived from the fit to both @xmath51 and @xmath50 data .",
    "the ugdfs based on bfkl and bk equations are not applied in the following analysis since they are dedicated to smaller-@xmath52 values .    in the calculation of charm and bottom",
    "quark cross sections the central value of numerical results is obtained with the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath53 and quark mass @xmath54 and @xmath55 gev for charm and bottom , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties of the predictions are estimated by changing quark mass by @xmath56 gev and by varying scales by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "the gray shaded bands drawn in the following figures represent these both sources of uncertainties summed in quadrature .",
    "the mstw08lo @xcite collinear parton distribution function ( pdf ) is used for the calculation of the kmr unintegrated gluon density .",
    "the transition from quarks and gluons to hadrons , called hadronization or parton fragmentation , can be so far approached only through phenomenological models . in principle , in the case of multi - particle final states the lund string model @xcite and the cluster fragmentation model @xcite are often used .",
    "however , the hadronization of heavy quarks in non - monte - carlo calculations is usually done with the help of fragmentation functions ( ff ) .",
    "the latter are similar objects as the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and provide the probability for finding a hadron produced from a high energy quark or gluon .    considering fragmentation of a high energy quark ( parton )",
    "@xmath58 with zero transverse momentum @xmath59 into a hadron @xmath60 one usually assumes that the transition is soft and does not add any transverse momentum . in consequence it is a delta function in transverse momentum .    defining @xmath61 as the probability for the quark @xmath58 fragmenting into a hadron @xmath62 which carries a fraction @xmath63 of its longitudinal momentum ,",
    "the spectrum of hadrons is given by @xmath64 or @xmath65 this can be generalized to the fragmentation at finite @xmath59 with intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath66 .",
    "thus the incoming quark has transverse momentum @xmath67 and the outgoing hadron transverse momentum can be decomposed as @xmath68 . moving back to the situation where @xmath69 one can argue that the intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath66 must be small .    introducing the transverse momentum dependent",
    "fragmentation probablity @xmath70 one obtains the hadron spectum as @xmath71 however , one often neglects the intrinsic transverse momentum assuming : @xmath72 then the general formula reads @xmath73 or integrating out the @xmath74-functions @xmath75 it is belived that this procedure provides correct implementation of small intrinsic transverse momentum into the splitting .",
    "since the hadron on - shell four momentum is fully specified by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , starting from the above formula one can calculate many different distributions .",
    "especially conversion to the rapidity distributions is very simple because of the trivial jacobian : @xmath78 it can be further written @xmath79 neglecting masses , one has @xmath80 so that , @xmath81 this way one gets ( reproduces ) the standard formula for the fragmentation in the case of light hadrons .",
    "when going to more general case , taking masses into account and introducing @xmath82 , one gets @xmath83 or @xmath84 then , the @xmath63-dependent rapidity shift between quark and hadron reads @xmath85 the delta function now becomes @xmath86 finally , @xmath87 in turn , using @xmath88 , the rapidity shift @xmath89 can be rewritten @xmath90 it is clear that the rescalling of the transverse momentum is the most important effect .",
    "this is because one deals with very steep functions of transverse momenta .",
    "from the reason that rapidity spectra are usually flat , or slowly varying , the shift @xmath89 is not so important .",
    "in fact , it is entirely negligible , if @xmath91",
    ". the shift is most important at very small @xmath92 , where it becomes @xmath93 it is worth to notice , that at finite @xmath77 it should never be really large : small @xmath63 is damped by the fact that the quark spectrum drops rapidly as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "however , at @xmath77 = 0 , that suppression causes an effect and the whole integral over @xmath63 becomes important , with very small @xmath63 causing large rapidity shifts .",
    "fortunately , for heavy quarks , the fragmentation function is peaked at large @xmath63 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , one has to remember , that taking into account the small-@xmath63 region in the fragmentation function is theoretically not warranted , since the standard dglap approach to fragmentation breaks down in this region .    taking all together , according to the above formalism , in the following numerical calculations the inclusive distributions of open charm and bottom hadrons @xmath94 are obtained through a convolution of inclusive distributions of heavy quarks / antiquarks and @xmath95 fragmentation functions : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath63 is the fraction of longitudinal momentum of heavy quark @xmath38 carried by a hadron @xmath62 .",
    "the origin why the approximation typical for light hadrons assuming that @xmath98 is unchanged in the fragmentation process , i.e. @xmath99 , is also applied in the case of heavy hadrons was carefully clarified in the previous paragraph and is commonly accepted .    as a default set in all the following numerical calculations the standard peterson model of fragmentation function @xcite with the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "is applied .",
    "this choice of fragmentation function and parameters is based on our previous theoretical studies of open charm production at the lhc @xcite , where detailed analysis of uncertainties related with application of different models of ffs was done . here , we decided not to repeat all the previously analyzed issues and take into consideration only the most data - favoured scenario .",
    "the main conclusions should not change when moving from lhc to rhic energies and the uncertainties due to the fragmentation effects may be neglected with respect to those related to the perturbative part of the calculation .    in the calculations of the cross sections for @xmath102 and @xmath103 mesons",
    "the fragmentation functions should be normalized to the relevant branching fractions @xmath104 , e.g. from ref .",
    "however , the measured by star differential distributions for @xmath102 and @xmath103 meson are normalized to the parton - level @xmath105 cross section which simply means that the @xmath106 should be taken in numerical calculations .",
    "theoretical predictions for production of non - photonic leptons in proton - proton scattering is a three - step process .",
    "the whole procedure can be written in the following schematic way : @xmath107 where the symbol @xmath108 denotes a generic convolution .",
    "thus , the cross section for non - photonic leptons is a convolution of the cross section for heavy quarks with fragmentation function @xmath109 and with semileptonic decay function @xmath110 for heavy mesons .    in principle",
    ", the semileptonic decays can be calculated @xcite . the simplest approach to describe the decays of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons",
    "is given by the spectator model @xcite , where the qcd effects from the higher - order corrections between heavy @xmath38 and light @xmath58 quarks are neglected .",
    "this model works better for bottom quarks since there the mass sufficiently suppresses these corrections . in the case of charm ,",
    "the qcd effects become more important but they can be also qualitatively modelled .",
    "since there are many decay channels with different number of particles the above procedure is not easy and rather labor - intensive .",
    "it introduces some model uncertainties and requires inclusion of all final state channels explicitly .",
    "an alternative way to incorporate semileptonic decays into theoretical model is to take relevant experimental input .",
    "for example , the cleo @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations have measured very precisely the momentum spectrum of electrons / positrons coming from the decays of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , respectively .",
    "this is done by producing resonances : @xmath111 which decays into @xmath4 and @xmath112 mesons , and @xmath113 which decays into @xmath5 and @xmath114 mesons .",
    "this less ambitious but more pragmatic approach is based on purely empirical fits to ( not absolutely normalized ) cleo and babar experimental data points .",
    "these electron decay functions should account for the proper branching fractions which are known experimentally ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the branching fractions for various species of @xmath4 mesons are different : @xmath115 because the shapes of positron spectra for both decays are identical within error bars we can take the average value of br(@xmath116 and simplify the calculation . in turn",
    ", the branching fraction of open bottom is found to be : @xmath117    after renormalizing to experimental branching fractions the adjusted decay functions are then use to generate leptons in the rest frame of the decaying @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons in a monte carlo approach . this way one can avoid all uncertainties associated with explicit calculations of semileptonic decays of mesons .    in both cases the heavy mesons are almost at rest ,",
    "so in practice one measures the meson rest frame distributions of electrons / positrons . with this assumption one can find a good fit to the cleo and babar data with : @xmath118 in these purely empirical parametrizations",
    "@xmath119 must be taken in gev .    in order to take into account the small effect of the non - zero motion of the @xmath4 mesons in the case of the cleo experiment and of the @xmath5 mesons in the case of the babar experiment",
    ", the above parametrizations of the fits in the laboratory frames have to be modified .",
    "the improvement can be achieved by including the boost of the new modified rest frame functions to the cleo and babar laboratory frames . the quality of fits from eqs .",
    "( [ cleo_fit_function ] ) and ( [ babar_fit_function ] ) will be reproduced .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 rest frame decay functions take the following form : @xmath120            both , laboratory and rest frame parametrizations of the semileptonic decay functions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons are drawn in fig .  [",
    "fig : p - decay-1 ] together with the cleo ( left panel ) and babar ( right panel ) experimental data .",
