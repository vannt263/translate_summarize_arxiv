    "the multiplicity of stars is influenced by the specific characteristics of the star formation process , and thus has been the subject of extensive measurements .",
    "similarly , in an attempt to gain insight into the formation of brown dwarfs , recent studies have heavily scrutinized the binary properties of objects near and below the hydrogen burning mass limit in the solar neighborhood @xcite , open clusters @xcite , and young clusters and associations @xcite .",
    "most of the binary low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in these surveys exhibit maximum separations of @xmath7  au , which is consistent with the predictions of the embryo ejection scenario for the formation of low - mass bodies @xcite .",
    "however , a small but growing number of low - mass binaries have been found at wider projected separations that range from 33 - 41  au @xcite to beyond 200  au @xcite . because these wide binaries are weakly bound and extremely fragile , it is unlikely they that have been subjected to violent dynamical interactions , indicating that some low - mass stars and brown dwarfs are able to form without the involvement of ejection .",
    "in fact , the role of ejection may be minor based on other aspects of the multiplicity of low - mass objects @xcite .    to fully utilize multiplicity as a probe of the formation of low - mass bodies",
    ", it is necessary to consider populations spanning a range of ages and star - forming conditions .",
    "ob associations represent an area of this phase space that remained unexplored until @xcite obtained @xmath8 images of low - mass members of upper scorpius , which has an age of 5  myr @xcite and is the nearest ob association at a distance 145  pc @xcite . among their 12 targets",
    ", they discovered three binaries , all with projected separations less than 18  au .",
    "@xcite tentatively suggested that this absence of wide systems in upper sco relative to lower density clusters like chamaeleon  i and tw hya @xcite might indicate a variation in the formation process of low - mass binaries with star - forming environment .    in this letter ,",
    "i report the discovery of a widely - separated low - mass binary star in upper sco , which was found serendipitously during a spectroscopic survey of the low - mass members of this association .",
    "i present near - infrared ( ir ) images and spectroscopy of the components of the pair , measure their spectral types and assess their membership in a binary system , and discuss the implications of this new pair .",
    "while conducting a spectroscopic survey of known low - mass members of the upper sco association on 2005 june 16 with spex @xcite at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) , i found that one of the targets , denis - p  j161833.2 - 251750.4 @xcite , appeared as a @xmath9 double on the slit - viewing camera .",
    "to further investigate the nature of this pair , i performed the imaging and spectroscopy described in this section .      to measure the flux ratio of the components of denis - p  j161833.2 - 251750.4 ( hereafter denis  1618 - 2517 )",
    ", i used the slit - viewing camera on spex .",
    "this camera contained a @xmath10 aladdin 2 insb array and had a plate scale of @xmath11  pixel@xmath12 @xcite . through a @xmath0 filter",
    ", i obtained 18 dithered one - second exposures .",
    "these images were median combined to produce a flat field image , which was then divided into each original exposure .",
    "the 12 frames with the best image quality were registered and combined . a @xmath13 subsection of the resulting image surrounding denis  1618 - 2517 is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the components of this pair exhibit fwhm@xmath14 in this image .",
    "i extracted photometry for each object with the task phot under the iraf package apphot using a radius of three pixels , arriving at a magnitude difference of @xmath15  mag . to measure astrometry for the pair , i first determined the rotation between the cardinal directions and the array axes using the 2mass coordinates of denis  1618 - 2517 and the one other 2mass source appearing in the image ( 2mass 16183428 - 2518067 ) . with this information , i measured a position angle of @xmath16 for the secondary relative to the primary .",
    "using the plate scale from @xcite , i then measured a separation of @xmath17 for the pair .",
    "spectra were obtained of the components of denis  1618 - 2517 using spex in the prism mode with a @xmath18 slit .",
    "this configuration produced a wavelength coverage of 0.8 - 2.5  and a resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "after adjusting the position angle of the slit to align it with the axis connecting the pair , i selected an integration time of 30  sec and obtained a total of 18 exposures during a sequence of dithers between two positions on the slit .",
    "the 10 frames with the best image quality were reduced with the spextool package @xcite .",
    "the data were corrected for telluric absorption with the method described by @xcite .",
    "i now use the photometry and spectroscopy from the previous section to examine the spectral types and extinctions of the components of denis  1618 - 2517 .",
    "@xcite found that the h@xmath20 emission and na  i absorption in an unresolved optical spectrum of the pair were indicative of youth and thus membership in upper sco . in the spex data ,",
    "i find evidence of youth in both objects .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] , each spectrum exhibits a triangular @xmath3-band continuum , which is a distinguishing characteristic of cool pre - main - sequence objects @xcite .",
    "the depths of the optical and ir molecular absorption bands , primarily tio , vo , and h@xmath21o , are also very similar between the two objects , demonstrating that the two objects have the same spectral type to within @xmath22  subclass . in comparison , two young low - mass stars at the same age with a @xmath0-band magnitude difference of 0.42",
    "are predicted to have @xmath23  k @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath22  subclass @xcite .",
    "thus , the relative spectral types and magnitudes of the components of denis  1618 - 2517 are consistent with the coevality expected for a binary system .    although the absorption band strengths agree between the two objects , the secondary is redder beyond 1.7  .",
    "this is difficult to explain as a difference in spectral type or extinction , and instead probably is due to excess emission from circumstellar material around the secondary , an imperfect separation of the light from the two objects during extraction of their spectra , or the combination of misalignment of the slit along the binary axis and differential refraction .",
    "meanwhile , the ir spectra of both denis  1618 - 2517  a and b are significantly redder than most of the other low - mass members of upper sco that were observed during the same run .",
    "the same trend is present in the 2mass @xmath24 and @xmath25 colors of these objects and is consistent with extinction .",
    "relative to the bluest ( i.e. , unreddened ) spex data of members of upper sco and other young clusters at m5-m6 @xcite , the spectrum of denis  1618 - 2517  a+b exhibits an extinction of @xmath26 .",
    "the presence of significant reddening is additional evidence that these objects are not foreground field dwarfs .",
    "based on the strength of the molecular absorption bands , denis  1618 - 2517  a and b are earlier than most of the other upper sco members observed in this run , which have optical spectral types that range from m5 to m9 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that denis  1618 - 2517  a+b may be closer to m5 than the value of m6 measured by @xcite .",
    "i find the same result when i compare the pair to optically - classified members of other young clusters .",
    "for instance , as shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] , the molecular absorption bands of denis  1618 - 2517  a+b agree better with those of mho  6 than with mho  5 , which have optical types of m4.75 and m6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the relatively large reddening toward denis  1618 - 2517 may have caused @xcite to arrive at a spectral type that was slightly too late . combining a spectral type of m5 with the temperature scale of @xcite and the evolutionary models of @xcite implies a mass of @xmath4  @xmath27 for each component of denis  1618 - 2517 .",
    "the results from the previous section and from @xcite demonstrated that the components of denis  1618 - 2517 are young members of upper sco .",
    "i now examine if they are likely to comprise a true binary system rather than a pair of unrelated members of the association that happen to have a small projected separation .",
    "the surface density of m - type members of upper sco is @xmath28  deg@xmath29 and the total area of the association is @xmath30  deg@xmath31 @xcite . across the entire association , the probability of finding",
    "a pair of m - type members with a projected separation of @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "the observations that discovered this pair considered only a small fraction of the membership ( a few dozen ) and were not designed to detect close pairs . as a result , the relevant probability for denis  1618 - 2517 is lower by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "based on the very low value of this probability , i conclude that denis  1618 - 2517  a and b comprise a binary system rather than two unrelated members of upper sco . using the average distance of 145  pc for the association @xcite , the projected separation of @xmath1 of this pair corresponds to 140  au .    demonstrating a common proper motion for a pair of stars is the conventional method of conclusively establishing binarity in the solar neighborhood , but it is less useful for young populations because even unrelated cluster members are comoving at the level of precision typically available for these measurements .",
    "for instance , the common proper motions measurements for the recently discovered substellar companions to gq  lup @xcite and 2 m  1207 - 3932 @xcite are not precise enough to distinguish between true binaries and comoving unbound cluster members seen in projection near each other .",
    "thus , for gq  lup , 2 m  1207 - 3932 , previously known pairs in upper sco @xcite , and indeed the vast majority of visual doubles in young clusters and associations , available evidence of binarity is based on the same statistical considerations presented in this work for denis  1618 - 2517 .",
    "only the value of the probability differs among these binaries , which depends on the separation of a given pair and the surface density of cluster members .",
    "the probability of unrelated clusters members with small separations is exceedingly low for sparse populations like upper sco , chamaeleon , lupus , and tw hya @xcite but non - negligible for dense clusters like the trapezium in orion @xcite .",
    "as with the brown dwarf pair in chamaeleon from @xcite , the binarity of denis  1618 - 2517 was discovered serendipitously and thus can not be used at this time in a multiplicity measurement for low - mass members of upper sco . however , the mere existence of this binary system has important implications .",
    "first , denis  1618 - 2517 is one of only a few known low - mass binaries with very wide separations ( @xmath34  au , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these wide pairs are fragile and easily disrupted , and thus demonstrate that some low - mass stars and brown dwarfs can form without the assistance of ejection .",
    "in addition , with these observations of denis  1618 - 2517 , wide low - mass binaries are now known across a wider range of star - forming conditions , from small , sparse clusters ( chamaeleon ) and to rich ob associations ( upper sco ) .",
    "thus , in the measurements available to date , the formation of wide low - mass binaries has no discernible dependence on star - forming environment ."
