    "it is well known that defects like quantum vortices , spin vortices , dislocations and disclinations play an essential role in physics of low - temperature phases of thin films .",
    "berezinskii @xcite and then kosterlitz and thouless @xcite recognized that there is a class of phase transitions in @xmath5 systems related to the defects .",
    "the main idea of their approach is that in @xmath5 the defects can be treated as point objects interacting like charged particles .",
    "it is usually called coulomb gas analogy .",
    "the low - temperature phase corresponds to a fluid constituted of bound uncharged defect - antidefect pairs , which is an insulator , whereas the high - temperature phase contains free charged particles and can be treated as plasma .",
    "correspondingly , in the low - temperature phase the correlation length is infinite whereas in the high - temperature phase it is finite .",
    "a huge number of works is devoted to different aspects of the problem , see , e.g. , the surveys @xcite .",
    "the scheme proposed by kosterlitz and thouless can be applied to superfluid and hexatic films and planar @xmath5 magnetics .",
    "it admits a generalization for crystalline films , see refs .",
    "@xcite . there are also applications to superconductive materials , especially to high-@xmath6 superconductors , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the films in the presence of the defects was considered in the papers @xcite . in the works a complete set of equations",
    "is formulated describing both motion of the defects and hydrodynamic degrees of freedom .",
    "then , to obtain macroscopic dynamic equations , an averaging over an intermediate scale was performed . at the procedure",
    "the `` current density '' related to the defects was substituted by an expression proportional to the average `` electric field '' and to gradients of the temperature and of the chemical potential .",
    "the resulting equations perfectly correspond to the problems solved in the works @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at the procedure an information concerning high - order correlations of the defect motion is lost .",
    "that is the motivation for the present work where these high - order correlations are examined .",
    "we start from the same `` microscopical '' equations of the defect dynamics as was accepted in ref .",
    "@xcite . following the works we focus mainly on the case when the motion of the defects is determined by the langevin equation describing an interplay between the coulomb interaction and the thermal noise .",
    "we believe that the approach is correct for hexatic films ( membranes , langmuir films , freely suspended films ) .",
    "the situation is a bit more complicated for the vortices in superfluid films because of the magnus force .",
    "nevertheless , the equation for the vortices is close to the langevin equation , see ref .",
    "similar equations can be formulated for the dislocations in crystalline films , see ref .",

    "we will not consider the last cases here , though our scheme is , generally , applicable to the systems .",
    "treating non - simultaneous correlation functions related to the defects one should take into account creation and annihilation processes also .",
    "for the purpose we use the doi technique @xcite who demonstrated that dynamics of classical particles involved into chemical reactions can be examined in terms of the creation and annihilation operators , like in the quantum field theory .",
    "we consider correlation functions @xmath0 of the `` charge density '' @xmath7 ( vorticity , disclinicity etc ) provided that the so - called renormalized fugacity @xmath3 is small .",
    "the inequality @xmath8 is satisfied for large scales in the low - temperature phase and probably in some region of scales above @xmath6 . in statics ,",
    "the normal estimate @xmath4 is valid at the condition .",
    "surprisingly , the non - simultaneous high - order correlation functions @xmath0 appear to be much larger than their normal estimate @xmath9 . in the low - temperature phase",
    "the phenomenon reveals an anomalous scaling on large scales .",
    "the reason for such unusual behavior is that the main contribution to high - order non - simultaneous correlation functions is associated with rare single defect - antidefect pairs .",
    "the situation resembles the intermittency phenomenon in turbulence , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it can also be compared with non - trivial tails of probability distribution functions in the physics of disordered materials , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "some preliminary results were published in the paper @xcite .",
    "let us give a qualitative explanation of the phenomenon . to obtain a non - zero contribution to the correlation function",

    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vort8 ] .",
    "the `` single - pair '' contribution has to be compared with a `` normal '' contribution associated with a number of defect - antidefect pairs . though the normal contribution contains an additional large entropy factor it has also an additional small factor related to a small probability to observe a defect - antidefect pair with a separation larger than the core radius . as a result of the competition",
    ", the normal contribution appears to be smaller . to avoid a misunderstanding ,",
    "let us stress that the arguments do not work for the simultaneous correlation functions .",
    "the reason is that trajectories of two defects can not pass through @xmath13 points simultaneously , see fig .",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ basic ] we remind some basic facts concerning static properties of the @xmath5 defects and their dynamics and then we shortly review the doi technique @xcite suitable for our problem . in section [ quantum ]",
    "we develop a diagrammatic representation for dynamical objects and examine the two - particle conditional probability which is extensively exploited in the subsequent consideration . in section [ renorm ] we demonstrate how renormalization of different parameters can be obtained in the framework of our dynamic approach . actually , the renormalization is reduced to the well known static renormalization group equations . in section [ corr ]",
    "we consider correlation functions of the `` charge density '' and ground the properties announced above . in section [ helium ]",
    "we generalize our procedure for the case of superfluid films . in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the main results of our work and their possible relations to other systems .",
    "some calculations are placed into appendices .",
    "static properties of the system of the vortex - like defects in thin films can be described quite universally .",
    "the starting point of the description is the free energy associated with the defects @xmath14 where the subscripts @xmath15 label defects , @xmath16 are positions of the defects , @xmath17 is a cutoff parameter of the order of the size of the defect core , @xmath18 are integer numbers determining the `` strength '' of the defects , @xmath19 is a dimensionless @xmath20-dependent factor and @xmath21 is the energy associated with the core .",
    "the expression ( [ h04 ] ) is correct for quantum vortices in superfluid films , for disclinations in hexatic films , and for spin vortices in @xmath5 planar magnets . for dislocations in crystalline films the expression ( [ h04 ] )",
    "has to be slightly modified @xcite , but the main peculiarity of the free energy , the logarithmic dependence on the separation , remains the same .",
    "the gibbs distribution @xmath22 corresponding to the energy ( [ h04 ] ) can be treated as the partition function of two - dimensional point particles with charges @xmath23 , @xmath19 playing a role of the `` inverse temperature '' .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 can be considered also as the coulomb coupling constant .",
    "basing on the electrostatic analogy one can introduce the `` charge density '' @xmath24 the quantity @xmath7 is vorticity for superfluid films and disclinicity for hexatic films .",
    "we will treat the case when defects are produced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "since both creation and annihilation processes conserve the `` charge '' we should accept that the total charge is zero : @xmath25 .",
    "it leads to the constraint @xmath26 where the integration is performed over the total area of the specimen .",
    "below we assume that for @xmath27 the core energy @xmath28 is so large that such defects are hardly created . then only defects with the charges @xmath29 should be taken into account .",
    "we will call the objects with the charges @xmath30 defects and the objects with the charges @xmath31 antidefects . because of the constraint @xmath25 there can be simultaneously @xmath32 defects and @xmath32 antidefects in the system .",
    "thus , the partition function of the system can be characterized via a set of probability distribution functions @xmath33 depending on coordinates of @xmath34 `` particles '' . in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ h04 ] ) the functions can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the sum over states and the quantity @xmath37 is usually called fugacity .",
    "the possibility to neglect charges with @xmath27 implies that the fugacity is small .",
    "the low - temperature ( insulator ) phase can be treated as a system constituted of bound defect - antidefect pairs . in the high - temperature ( plasma )",
    "phase there are unbound charges which essentially influence the system on scales larger than the correlation length @xmath38 .",
    "we will treat the low - temperature phase and the region of scales between @xmath17 and @xmath38 in the high - temperature phase where one can neglect the role of the unbound charges and only the bound defect - antidefect pairs have to be taken into account .",
    "the presence of the pairs in the system leads to non - trivial `` dielectric '' properties of the medium . as a result",
    "the interaction between the charges is modified , the effect can be described in terms of a scale - dependent `` dielectric constant '' of the medium as is suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath19 becomes dependent on the separation between the charges .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath19 can be described in the framework of the scheme proposed by kosterlitz , @xcite .",
    "namely , the partition function of the system can be integrated over separations of the defect - antidefect pairs between the core size @xmath39 and a scale @xmath2 .",
    "after the procedure , that can be interpreted as shifting the core radius @xmath40 , the form of the probability distribution functions ( [ parti ] ) is reproduced ( with @xmath2 instead of @xmath17 ) , but the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath3 are renormalized .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath3 is determined by the following renormalization group equations found in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a numerical factor of order unity .",
    "the @xmath2-dependent function @xmath3 is the renormalized fugacity .",
    "it determines a concentration of defects belonging to the bound pairs with separations of the order of @xmath2 , the concentration can be estimated as @xmath43 .",
    "the renormalized value of @xmath19 determines the dependence of the strength of the coulomb interaction on the separation between the charges . in the low - temperature phase",
    ", the effective value of @xmath19 tends to a constant on large scales .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath19 is larger than @xmath44 , the critical value @xmath45 corresponds to the transition temperature . in the asymptotic region , where @xmath19 can be treated as @xmath2-independent ,",
    "the renormalized fugacity @xmath3 remains @xmath2-dependent .",
    "its asymptotic behavior can easily be extracted from eq .",
    "( [ rg ] ) : @xmath46 thus , in the low - temperature phase @xmath3 tends to zero as scale increases .",
    "let us turn to simultaneous correlation functions of the charge density @xmath7 ( [ den ] ) .",
    "the odd correlation function are zero .",
    "indeed , the system is symmetric under permuting defects and antidefects whereas the charge density ( [ den ] ) changes its sign at the permutation .",
    "the pair correlation function can be written as ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath47 a generalization of the relation ( [ pair ] ) can be obtained ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) which is @xmath48 where all separation @xmath49 are assumed to be of the same order @xmath50 . in the large - scale limit where @xmath19 is saturated we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an arbitrary factor .",
    "the relation ( [ high ] ) shows that the simultaneous statistics of @xmath7 has normal scaling , that is scaling exponents of the correlation functions of the order @xmath53 are equal to @xmath54 times the scaling exponent of the pair correlation function ( [ pair ] ) .",
    "we will demonstrate that the behavior of non - simultaneous correlation functions of the charge density is quite different .",
    "to examine dynamical characteristics of the system we should formulate a dynamical equation for a defect motion .",

    "we believe that the equation ( [ h51 ] ) is applicable to the dynamics of disclinations in hexatic films like membranes , freely suspended films and langmuir films . the equation for the vortices in superfluid films is a bit more complicated .",

    "remember that we neglect defects with @xmath61 .",
    "next , processes where a number of defect - antidefect pairs are created at the same point are suppressed since probability of such events is small due to the energy associated with the cores of defects",
