    "finite type invariants have been a hot topic of study in recent years , having first been introduced in proto - form in a seminal paper of vassiliev[v ] , from which derives their alternative moniker `` vassiliev invariants '' . birman and lin [ bl ] , upon reading vassiliev s paper were able to give the by now familiar simple axiomatic condition for being a finite type invariant of type n : given a knot invariant @xmath5 taking values in an abelian group extend it to knots with finitely many transverse double points by the following formula , obligatory in any paper on finite type invariants .",
    "the invariant @xmath5 is _ finite type of type n _ iff it vanishes on knots with @xmath6 double points .",
    "birman and lin also proved that the coefficients of @xmath7 in the jones polynomial under the change of variables @xmath8 are type @xmath1 invariants .",
    "this is actually equivalent to saying that the @xmath1th derivatives @xmath9 are type @xmath1 invariants , and indeed this is used in the last section of the present paper .",
    "gusarov[g ] takes a different tack , constructing a group of knots , @xmath10 , which is a quotient of the monoid of knots under connected sum .",
    "the equivalence relation , as proven by stanford and ng[ns ] , may be chosen to be that two knots are equivalent iff all additive type n invariants are the same .",
    "an alternate description of this group is given as follows .",
    "given a knot @xmath0 choose @xmath6 disjoint groups of crossing changes @xmath11 for the knot .",
    "( @xmath12 is called a _ scheme _ by gusarov , or at least by his translator . )",
    "if this scheme has the property that for some @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the knot modified along the crossing changes in @xmath16 . ) for all nonempty @xmath16 , then we say @xmath17 .",
    "( @xmath0 is @xmath1-equivalent to @xmath13 . )",
    "remarkably , @xmath18 is an equivalence relation [ ns ] .",
    "if we quotient the monoid of knots under @xmath19 by @xmath18 we recover gusarov s group @xmath10 .",
    "denote elements in @xmath10 by @xmath20_n$ ] , where @xmath0 is a knot representing the equivalence class @xmath20_n$ ] .",
    "in fact , for any scheme @xmath12 the element @xmath21 is trivial where @xmath22_n$ ] , where @xmath23 is the cardinality of @xmath16 .",
    "indeed this is the main tool of the present paper .",
    "this expands on the idea of lin and kalfagianni [ l - k ] to just use the relation @xmath18 .",
    "also , if we extend the above definition of finite type invariants to links , this formula still holds in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath24 be a type @xmath1 invariant and @xmath12 a scheme of @xmath6 sets of crossing changes of a link @xmath13 , then @xmath25 _ [ proof ] _",
    "( following [ g ] , lemma 5.2 )    an immediate consequence of the finite type axiom is the following :    if @xmath12 is a scheme of cardinality @xmath6 on @xmath13 where each @xmath26 is a single crossing change , then @xmath27 , if @xmath24 is a type @xmath1 invariant .",
    "our task is to prove this when the @xmath28 contain more than one crossing change .",
    "we induct on say @xmath29 .",
    "given @xmath12 where @xmath30 , and suppose without loss of generality that @xmath31 is a partition of @xmath32 into two nonempty sets .",
    "we define 2 schemes of lower complexity : @xmath33 where , if @xmath34 is a move on @xmath13 , the move @xmath35 denotes the induced move on the link modified along @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37    @xmath38    note that this lemma generalizes the fact that @xmath39 in two senses : a ) it holds for non - additive knot invariants and b ) it holds for _ link _ invariannts .",
    "we d like to point out also that a `` set of crossing changes '' @xmath28 can be thought of a homotopy of the knot ( or link ) supported in a disjoint union of balls .",
    "indeed it is useful to think of it this way , in which case a scheme @xmath12 is a set of `` disjointly supported homotopies . ''",
    "( any homotopy of a knot beginning and ending with an embedding is equivalent to a homotopy which is a set of disjointly supported finger moves , i.e. crossing changes . )      a grope , @xmath40 , of class @xmath1 , loosely , is a 2-complex representing an @xmath1 commutator [ ft ] . to define gropes recursively ,",
    "however , we use a different quantity , _",
    "depth_. a depth @xmath41 grope is defined to be a circle , while a depth 2 grope is defined as a punctured surface . if you know what a depth @xmath42 grope is , to form a grope , @xmath40 , of depth @xmath1 , you take a punctured surface and to each element of a prescribed symplectic basis you glue a grope with depth @xmath42 , such that at least one of these attached gropes is of depth @xmath43 .",
    "the class of a grope @xmath40 is the term of the lower central series that the boundary circle represents , or explicitly , if @xmath44 is the symplectic basis and @xmath45 are the gropes to be added , then @xmath46 .      my result is then that if a knot bounds a grope of class @xmath1 , imbedded in @xmath47 , that that knot is trivial in @xmath48 .",
    "to do this i make repeated use of the fact that all the @xmath49 s are trivial in the group @xmath50 by finding appropriate collections of disjointly supported homotopies , the most interesting of which come from the in / out trick defined in section 4 . in a sense",
    "the main theorem is pretty easy to prove if you do nt mind not getting the optimal result .",
    "that is , without the in / out trick , it is not so hard to prove that class @xmath1 gropes are @xmath51- trivial .",
    "it is the in / out trick which allows one to get those two extra groups of crossing changes for odd @xmath1 .",
    "it was originally suggested by mike freedman that class @xmath1 gropes might always be @xmath43 trivial , ( e.g. one group of crossing changes for every ` tip ' . )",
    "this turns out to be overambitious by a factor of 2 and in the last section we indeed deduce the existence of class @xmath1 gropes that are not @xmath52-trivial .    an interesting consequence of the main theorem , ( or the slightly weaker one mentioned above ) is that a knot bounding a grope of arbitrarily large class can not be distinguished from the unknot by finite type invariants .",
    "it is a conjecture of mike freedman s that this phenomenon is impossible .",
    "indeed he conjectures that in any three manifold , you can not have an infinite imbedded grope , every stage of which is incompressible .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is similar to that of a paper of x.s .",
    "lin and e. kalfagianni[lk ] . in that paper",
    "it is proven that knots which bound certain immersed gropes of height @xmath53 are @xmath54-trivial , where @xmath55 .",
    "more specifically , they consider immersed gropes such that all self - intersections occur away from the bottom stage .",
    "there is also the restriction that the bottom stage is _ regular _ , which among other things implies that the complement of the seifert surface has free fundamental group .",
    "( it should be noted that the obvious generalization of their and my result , that all knots bounding immersed gropes are to some degree trivial , meets with the problem that all knots bound immersed gropes of arbitrary height , since the lower central series of a knot complement stabilizes at @xmath56 . )",
    "the method of proof of their theorem , which precedes mine , is to find crossing changes which implement the group - theoretic @xmath43-triviality of an @xmath1-commutator , and as such is similar to the ideas presented in the present paper , although the actual geometric implementation is quite different .",
    "for instance their paper is mainly concerned with the analysis of planar combinatorics , whereas mine uses more three dimensional arguments .",
    "it turns out in their case , as well as mine , that one can not fully realize the degree of triviality present in an @xmath1-commutator , the problem being that one must be able to find @xmath1 geometric independent moves which have the effect of deleting a letter in the commutator . for the case of imbedded gropes",
    "one can show that only @xmath57 of the moves are actually realizable independently , whereas in the case of regular seifert surfaces only @xmath58 of the moves are realizable independently .",
    "in section 1 the introduction was given .",
    "in section 2 we figure out how to put the grope @xmath40 into a nice form , and using this form , to associate a decorated graph @xmath59 to @xmath40 .",
    "in section 3 we reduce to the case when the bottom stage(the bottom stage is the one whose boundary is the knot itself . )",
    "is genus 1 , introducing two of the three types of moves ( homotopies ) we will need for the main theorem .",
    "we need to reduce to the genus 1 case in order to apply the in / out trick which only works for gropes with bottom stage genus 1 .    in section 4",
    "we describe the in / out trick , and give some applications .",
    "the trick is used in the proof of the main theorem and also in the construction of the knots in section 6 .    in section 5 , we finally polish off the main theorem .    in section 6 , we show that our result is optimal .",
    "i wish to thank arcs for their financial support . for the use of their program , knotscape , in calculating jones polynomials",
    "i thank morwen thistlethwaite and jim hoste . for many useful discussions and for the invention of the in / out trick for seifert surfaces , i thank my advisor peter teichner . for the original idea and for several stimulating discussions",
    "i thank mike freedman . for help in sorting out a couple minor details",
    "i thank arthur bartels , dave bachman and dave letscher . for the original idea of showing a knot",
    "is @xmath60-trivial by looking for crossing changes , i thank x.s .",
    "lin and effie kalfagianni .",
    "we begin by finding a nice handlebody surrounding the grope .",
    "we need the following definition of a particular 1 complex .",
    "the 1-complex @xmath61 is defined for all @xmath62 inductively as follows .",
    "@xmath63 is a point , while @xmath64 is an interval .",
    "now suppose @xmath65 is defined and has 1-valent vertices @xmath66 .",
    "form @xmath61 as the adjunction space gotten by gluing the midpoint of each of @xmath67 intervals @xmath68 to the corresponding @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath69 be imbedded circles representing the tips of the grope . for instance , if @xmath40 is a genus @xmath70 surface , there will be four @xmath69 .",
    "[ standardposition ] for every imbedded grope @xmath71 , there is a ball @xmath72 and handles @xmath73 such that for all @xmath74 , the cross section @xmath75 is equal to @xmath76 for some @xmath77 .",
    "further @xmath78 is just a point in @xmath79 .",
    "also @xmath80 .",
    "we also want there to be disks @xmath81 where @xmath82 with @xmath83 such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 and such that @xmath86 .",
    "also @xmath87 if @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we require that @xmath89 is a regular neighborhood of @xmath40 .    _ [ proof ] _",
    "first we show this is true for some model @xmath90 of @xmath40 in @xmath91.once we do this , we are done . for if @xmath92 then @xmath93 extends to give a pl - homeomorphism ( or diffeomorphism depending on which category you prefer ) of regular neighborhoods @xmath94 , which will transport the structure given on the model .",
    "a grope @xmath40 of depth 1 is just a circle . in this case",
    "we can let @xmath95 be an unknot . take @xmath72 to be a small neighborhood of some point of @xmath96 and",
    "take the single handle @xmath97 to be a regular neighborhood of the arc of @xmath96 outside of @xmath72 .",
    "the disk @xmath98 is just a spanning disk of @xmath96 intersected with @xmath72 .",
    "now , for the inductive step suppose we have a grope @xmath96 which is formed as follows .",
    "suppose the genus of the bottom stage of @xmath96 is @xmath99 with a symplectic basis @xmath100 where @xmath40 is formed by attaching gropes @xmath45 to @xmath101 respectively .",
    "since @xmath102 and @xmath103 have lower depth than @xmath96 , the theorem is assumed to hold for them .",
    "so we have balls @xmath104 together with handles @xmath105 satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem .",
    "let @xmath106 be a small subarc of @xmath107 inside @xmath108 and @xmath109 a small arc joining the endpoints of @xmath106 but with @xmath110 contained in the interior of the bottom stage of @xmath111 , such that @xmath112 bound a disk @xmath113 .",
    "modify @xmath108 slightly , via a finger move disjoint from the rest of @xmath114 and the various @xmath115 , so that @xmath116 with @xmath106 and @xmath113 lying outside @xmath108 .",
    "do this similarly for @xmath117 .",
    "see figure [ gluean ] .",
    "now to form @xmath96 attach annuli to the @xmath118 by gluing the cores of the annuli to the boundaries of @xmath118 orthogonally to @xmath119 .",
    "modify these by plumbing together the @xmath118 annuli for all @xmath67 and then connect summing all these together as in figure [ glue2 ] , to form the genus @xmath99 bottom stage of the grope .",
    "our new handlebody @xmath120 is formed as pictured in figure [ glue2 ] .",
    "the new handles are the same as the old , but @xmath72 is formed by taking a small regular neighborhood of @xmath121 .",
    "if a handle looked like @xmath122 in @xmath111 then in @xmath40 it looks like @xmath123 , the effect of attaching an annulus .",
    "also , the @xmath69 for @xmath40 are just made of all the @xmath69 for the @xmath111 and @xmath117 so they still lie nicely in the handles as a subset of @xmath124 .",
    "as for the existence of disks @xmath115 , consider a handle @xmath125 for @xmath40 with tip @xmath126 . by hypothesis , there is a disk @xmath127 which extends from @xmath126 to @xmath128 and hence to @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130    this theorem gives a simple way of forming knots which bound gropes , since we can imbed the handlebody in any way we please in @xmath47 . notice that the cores , @xmath69 , can be , using the disks @xmath115 , extended disjointly along annuli to curves @xmath131 on @xmath132.now , proceeding with the advertised construction of the graph @xmath59 , we wish to group the cores @xmath69 into collections of cores @xmath133 , @xmath134 where @xmath1 is the class of @xmath40 .",
    "we want these @xmath133 to have the property that if the collection of cores in some @xmath133 all bound disks , @xmath135 , into the complement of the grope , then the knot @xmath136 is isotopic to the unknot in a small regular neighborhood of @xmath137 .",
    "we do this inductively as follows . for a grope with @xmath138 , a seifert surface , let @xmath139 be formed by choosing one @xmath69 from each pair of dual bands .",
    "@xmath140 is the set containing all the other @xmath69 .",
    "these obviously have the required property , since if @xmath139 bounds disks into the grope complement , surgery on these compressing disks gives a spanning disk of @xmath136 . now a grope with @xmath141 , is formed by gluing gropes of lower depth , say @xmath45 to a symplectic basis of the bottom stage , @xmath142 .",
    "suppose the class of @xmath102 is @xmath28 and that of @xmath103 is @xmath143",
    ". then by the inductive hypothesis we have groupings @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , @xmath147 . by definition the class of @xmath148 ,",
    "let the elements of @xmath149 be called @xmath150 . for @xmath151 define @xmath152 and",
    "define @xmath153 .",
    "now define @xmath154 .",
    "now suppose @xmath155 bounds disks into the grope complement .",
    "then inductively for each @xmath156 , either @xmath102 or @xmath103 can be surgered to produce a disk , since there exists a @xmath157 such that @xmath158 or @xmath159 and hence for all @xmath156 , @xmath160 or @xmath161 bounds a disk .",
    "hence a half basis of the bottom stage bound imbedded disks and so surgery produces a spanning disk .",
    "a set of handles has the _ trivializiation property _",
    "iff when caps of these handles are abstractly added to the grope along the @xmath69 curves in this set of handles , the grope becomes contractible . another way to say this is if the caps are added to the grope in a standard unknotted model in @xmath47 , iterated surgery along the caps produces an unknotting disk .",
    "so now we have a handlebody surrounding @xmath40 , with @xmath1 groups of handles satisfying the trivialization property .",
    "such a group @xmath133 is said to be _ framed unlinked _ if the @xmath131 bound disks whose interiors intersect the grope only at handles not associated to a core in @xmath133 .",
    "this set of disks is called a _ cap_. ( when a disk does intersect a handle , by general position we can assume it does so in a single level @xmath162 . ) if @xmath133 is not framed unlinked , we say it is _ framed linked_. the reason for this terminology is that even if a group of handles @xmath163 look like an unlink , a pushed out core @xmath131 may link with @xmath69 and hence will not be able to bound a disk into the grope complement .",
    "fix a projection of the grope so that the 1-manifolds with boundary , @xmath164 are standardly arranged in decreasing order as the height function increases as in figure [ standheight ] .    to show this is possible ,",
    "let @xmath165 be an isotopy of @xmath166 to the standard picture depicted in figure [ standheight ] .",
    "put a collar @xmath167 on @xmath72 corresponding to the isotopy @xmath168 .",
    "let @xmath169 be a collar on @xmath170 corresponding to a constant isotopy .",
    "let @xmath171 be a collar on @xmath172 corresponding to the isotopy inverse to @xmath168 .",
    "we can think of the collar @xmath173 as an ambient isotopy of @xmath174 .",
    "we can now take the new @xmath72 to be @xmath170 , and the new handles to be regular neighborhoods of the part of the isotoped grope outside the new ball .",
    "the new disks @xmath115 are formed by evolving the @xmath175 outward along the radial parameter .",
    "a grope with the handlebody structure of theorem [ standardposition ] and designated groups of handles satisfying the trivialization property , @xmath133 , having a projection as described above , is said to be in _ standard position .",
    "_      given a grope @xmath40 in standard position , we form a decorated graph @xmath176 as follows .",
    "we call the vertices @xmath177 , corresponding to the @xmath1 groups of handles satisfying the trivialization property .",
    "we put an @xmath178 next to a vertex if that group of handles is framed linked .",
    "we put an edge between @xmath133 and @xmath179 , @xmath180 , if the group of handles @xmath179 ever cross over the group @xmath133 , with respect to the given projection .",
    "as an exercise , note that if @xmath59 consists of vertices with no edges and no @xmath178 s , then @xmath136 is unknotted .",
    "this is because the cores all bound disks , and also they are stacked with @xmath139 above @xmath140 above @xmath181 , etc .",
    "thus , in particular , there is a plane separating @xmath139 and @xmath140 intersecting the ball in a level circle with respect to the height function of the projection .",
    "so the disks bounding @xmath139 say can be restricted to lie above @xmath140 since if the disks ever ventured below the plane separating @xmath139 and @xmath140 they could be surgered to lie above that plane , using the 3-manifold topologist s favorite tool , the inner - most disk argument .",
    "given a decorated graph @xmath182 , the _ complexity _ , @xmath183 is defined to be the number of edges , @xmath184 , plus @xmath185 , which is defined as the number of vertices decorated with an @xmath178 .",
    "that is @xmath186 .",
    "a group of vertices @xmath187 is said to be _",
    "free _ if the @xmath133 are all framed unlinked and if for all @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) there is no edge in the graph connecting @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "given an edge or an ` l ' in the graph @xmath182 , we define a move which has the effect of deleting the edge or ` l ' , i.e. reducing @xmath183 .",
    "suppose the edge is between @xmath133 and @xmath179 .",
    "that means that some of the handles in @xmath179 cross over or under some of the handles in @xmath133 in the wrong way .",
    "then the move is defined to be the homotopy which switches these handle crossings , supported in balls associated to the crossings .",
    "( see [ g ] for instance . ) in order to remove an ` l ' from a vertex , suppose that vertex is @xmath133 . to unknot a handle in @xmath133 , first do handle crossings of the handle with itself so that the handle bounds a disk which intersects only other handles .",
    "however we must also make sure the handle is untwisted , which is to say that the pushed out core @xmath131 of the handle bounds a disk which intersects only other handles .",
    "let the boundary of the disk that the handle bounds be the longitude . then dehn twist to remove the appropriate number of multiples of the meridian of the handle .",
    "this twist is supported in some small section of the handle @xmath192 $ ] .",
    "do this for every handle in @xmath133 to remove the ` l ' .",
    "notice that any number of type i moves may be performed simultaneously , since the supports are by construction disjoint , with the effect that the corresponding edges or ",
    "l s are deleted in @xmath182 .      given a set , @xmath168 , of @xmath67 free vertices we define @xmath67 moves as follows .",
    "since the vertices are free , there are planes in @xmath193 which separate the groups of handles in @xmath168 , and which intersect the ball of the grope s handlebody in circles which lie standardly as level circles between the attaching regions of the groups of handles .",
    "we can now choose homotopies supported between the appropriate planes which contract the sets of handles down to trivial handles within a small neigborhood of the ball as in figure [ doublefivestar ] .",
    "these moves obviously have disjoint support by construction , and further doing any collection of them has the effect of trivializing at least one set of handles with the trivialization property .",
    "this has the effect of trivializing the grope .",
    "given a grope @xmath40 , we define a slightly different version of the graph defined in section [ graphk ] .",
    "fix a projection of the handlebody where all the @xmath195 occur in increasing order as height decreases . for the graph ,",
    "@xmath194 , we let there be vertices @xmath69 for every handle in the grope s associated handlebody , as opposed to one for each of the @xmath1 _ groups _ of handles .",
    "we put an @xmath178 next to the vertex if that core is framed linked in the previously defined sense ( since it is just one core you might say _ framed knotted _ instead ) , and we draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding handles cross in the wrong order in the projection .    in terms of the graph",
    "@xmath194 we can still do type @xmath196 and type @xmath197 moves , defined in the obvious analogous way",
    ". however , the result of doing a type @xmath197 move is no longer neccessarily to trivialize the knot but instead to reduce the total genus of the grope , where total genus is defined as the sum of the genera of all the stages of the grope .",
    "( since a trivialized handle has a core which bounds a disk , one can iteratively surger along the successively produced disks as long as the successive stages are genus one .",
    "when you hit a higher genus stage , the surgery has the effect of lowering the genus of that stage by one . )",
    "we have thus proved the following lemma .",
    "[ goodlemma ] if @xmath198 has @xmath67 free vertices then @xmath199_{k-1 } = \\sum \\pm [ \\partial g_i]_{k-1}\\in { \\mathcal g}_{k-1}$ ] , where @xmath200 is a grope of lower total genus than @xmath40 , but of the same class .    _ [ proof ] _",

    "consider , toward a contradiction , a counterexample which has minimal ( total genus , @xmath203 ) , ordered lexicographically .",
    "this example has bottom stage genus @xmath204 , by assumption .",
    "notice that @xmath194 has at least @xmath205 vertices , since for each pair of dual basis elements in the bottom stage we get at least @xmath1 vertices .",
    "i claim we can assume @xmath206 .",
    "otherwise , consider a scheme,@xmath12 , consisting of @xmath207 type @xmath196 moves .    by the triviality of the @xmath208 s mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "inside the group @xmath209 the knot @xmath210 is equivalent to a sum of knots of lower complexity and equal total genus , @xmath211_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil}=-\\sum_{\\emptyset\\neq\\sigma\\subset s } ( -1)^{|\\sigma | } [ k_\\sigma ] _ { \\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil}\\ ] ]    each of these knots in the sum have reduced complexity , hence , by minimality is @xmath2-trivial .",
    "thus @xmath20_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil}=0 $ ] , contradicting that @xmath0 is a counterexample .",
    "so it suffices to consider knots with @xmath206 .",
    "now @xmath212 since @xmath213 . on the other hand @xmath214",
    "# components - # cycles , implying there are at least @xmath215 components . hence there exist at least @xmath216 components , implying there are at least @xmath217 components without any framed linked vertices .",
    "we can choose a free set of @xmath52 vertices by selecting one vertex from each of these .",
    "so by lemma [ goodlemma ] , @xmath199_{\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil } = \\sum \\pm [ \\partial g_i]_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil } = 0 $ ] by the minimality of total genus . but this is a contradiction , since @xmath0 was supposed to be a counterexample .",

    "let us compute the relationship between @xmath125 and @xmath253 in terms of the jones polynomial .",
    "that is @xmath422 , where @xmath423 denotes the kauffman bracket .",
    "assume the writhe @xmath424 of the diagrams is zero away from the pictured spots",
    ". then @xmath425 and @xmath426 .",
    "thus @xmath427 , @xmath428 and @xmath429 .",
    "this implies the following relation , where we make the substitution @xmath430 , @xmath431 setting @xmath432 , we get @xmath433          first , choose @xmath60 free vertices @xmath436 on the @xmath384 half of @xmath13 , none of which shares an edge with the @xmath254 vertex in @xmath437 .",
    "the possible ways that we altered the graph are listed in figure [ graphmoves ] .",
    "each is contained in a graph which spans all vertices and is homeomorphic to a line as remarked earlier , which we can always choose with @xmath254 as the second vertex from an endpoint .",
    "it is then obvious we can choose @xmath60 vertices which do not share an edge with @xmath254 .",
    "consider the two indicated sets of crossing changes , where ` @xmath254 ' is our old friend .",
    "doing @xmath440 makes all @xmath133 bound their caps in the complement of @xmath416 .",
    "@xmath384 is thus isotopic to the unknot in the complement of @xmath416 since the isotopy is supported in a neighborhood of @xmath441 .",
    "we are then left with an unlink since @xmath416 is unknotted when @xmath384 is removed . similarly doing @xmath254 leaves an unlink of two components .",
    "consider the scheme @xmath442 , where @xmath28 are type @xmath364 moves trivializing the @xmath443 .",
    "doing such a type @xmath364 move also yields an unlink , because after the @xmath443 handles are trivialized , they bound caps in the complement of @xmath416 and so the previous argument goes through .",
    "similarly , the in and out moves on @xmath444 trivialize the knot in a neighborhood of @xmath445 . indeed doing any combination of moves in @xmath12",
    "gives an unlink .",
    "since @xmath446 , it follows that @xmath447 for all @xmath435 .",
    "( recall @xmath448 is a type @xmath67 link invariant .",
    "i claim that @xmath456 .",
    "otherwise , ( [ 4star ] ) implies that @xmath457 .",
    "consider ( [ 5star ] ) .",
    "it implies that @xmath458 for all @xmath435 .",
    "but @xmath0 is @xmath345-trivial by the main theorem , hence @xmath459 .",
    "since @xmath125 and @xmath253 are @xmath60 trivial , and @xmath460 is invariant under @xmath238 , this implies @xmath461 this would imply @xmath462 , contradicting our choice of @xmath125 .",
    "in order for @xmath466 , @xmath467 , which means that either ( @xmath468 ) or ( @xmath469 and @xmath470 ) or ( @xmath471 and @xmath472 or @xmath473 . in order for @xmath474 , @xmath475 .",
    "so the only potentially nonzero terms that arise upon evaluating ( [ yuppy ] ) occur when @xmath476 or @xmath477 or @xmath478 .",
    "so we get , for @xmath479 ,          so , equation ( [ 5star ] ) implies @xmath484 .",
    "thus , since @xmath485 , we have shown that @xmath486 . in @xmath487 , @xmath488 , and",
    "since @xmath489 are @xmath345-trivial ( @xmath490 and then @xmath491 ) , this implies @xmath492 , establishing the key property of the inductive statement .",
    "we must also show that the graph of @xmath0 has no cycles and has valences less than or equal to 2 , and that each edge corresponds to a finger move .",
    "when one forms @xmath0 from @xmath125 the handle pattern is the same .",
    "to see that the two graph properties are the same , notice @xmath0 was constructed with one of the two following moves on the graph .",
    "the first one is to take a special edge , delete it , and then connect two added vertices to the endpoints of the deleted edge .",
    "the second is to delete two edges , add two vertices , and add four edges between the added vertices .",
    "the change is as diagrammed in figure [ graphmoves ] and preserves the properties we want .",
    "the fact that the edges correspond to finger moves follows since in the added surface @xmath416 , each added torus has a handle which links a handle of @xmath40 once in a single clasp .",
    "finally we must exhibit an example for the case @xmath380 .",
    "the only possible problem with the above induction would be if when forming @xmath125 as pictured in figure [ dim4ctreg ] , @xmath493 .",
    "however , using knotscape to calculate the jones polynomial , we see @xmath494 , and one may calculate @xmath495 ."
