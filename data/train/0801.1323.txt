    "the use of single - molecule electrical contacts for optoelectronic purposes such as light sources , light sensors , and photovoltaic devices is an exciting idea . yet , due to the difficulties that light - matter interactions in nanoscale systems pose for theoretical and experimental investigations , the possibilities remain largely unexplored . concerning experiments , it has been shown that light can be used to change the conformation of some molecules even when they are contacted to metallic electrodes , thus enabling light - controlled switching.@xcite some evidence of photoassisted processes influencing the conductance of laser - irradiated metallic atomic contacts has also been obtained.@xcite theoretical investigations of light - related effects in molecular contacts are more numerous , @xcite but they are mostly based on highly simplified models , whose validity remains to be checked by more detailed calculations@xcite and experiments . however , for the description of the basic phenomenology , model approaches can be very fruitful , as they have been in studies of elastic transport in the past .",
    "properties of linear single - orbital tight - binding ( tb ) chains , in particular , have been studied in detail , and to a large part analytically .",
    "@xcite in a step towards a more realistic description of the geometry , symmetries , and the electronic structure of particular molecules , empirical tb approaches such as the ( extended ) hckel method have proved useful.@xcite    based on a combination of density - functional calculations and simple phenomenological considerations , we have recently described the photoconductance of metal - oligophenylene - metal junctions.@xcite it was discussed how the linear - response conductance may increase by orders of magnitude in the presence of light .",
    "this effect can be seen as the result of a change in the character of the transport from off - resonant to resonant , due to the presence of photoassisted processes.@xcite consequently , the decay of the conductance with molecular length is slowed down , possibly even making the conductance length - independent.@xcite    in this paper we apply a hckel - type tb model of oligophenylene - based contacts@xcite combined with green - function methods@xcite to study the effects of monochromatic light on the dc current in metal - oligophenylene - metal contacts .",
    "again we concentrate on the dependence of these effects on the length of the molecule .",
    "we begin with a detailed account of the elastic transport properties of the model , and show that the zero - bias transmission function can be obtained analytically , similarly to simpler chain models.@xcite we demonstrate how information about the length dependence of the transmission function for a finite wire can be extracted from an infinitely extended polymer . based on these analytical results ,",
    "we discuss the length dependences of the conductance and the photoconductance for low - intensity and low - frequency light . while the conductance decays exponentially with length , its relative enhancement due to light exhibits a quadratic behavior . here",
    "we also briefly consider the thermopower , whose length dependence is linear .",
    "next , we calculate numerically the zero - bias photoconductance as a function of the light frequency @xmath1 , and find that the conductance - enhancement due to light is typically very large.@xcite in particular , we show that the results of ref .",
    "are expected to be robust with respect to variations in the assumed voltage profiles .",
    "finally , we describe how the step - like current - voltage ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) characteristics are modified by light . at high @xmath1 the most obvious effect is the overall increase in the low - bias current . at low @xmath1 , additional current steps similar to those in microwave - irradiated superconducting tunnel junctions@xcite can be seen .",
    "their separation , in our case of symmetric junctions , is roughly @xmath4 .",
    "tb models of the type we shall consider neglect various interaction effects ( see sec .  [ s.discussion ] for a discussion ) , and thus can not be expected to give quantitative predictions . however , the qualitative features of the results rely only on the tunneling - barrier character of the molecular contacts , which results from the fact that the fermi energy of the metal lies in the gap between the highest - occupied and lowest - unoccupied molecular orbitals ( homo and lumo ) of the molecule . thus , these features should remain similar for junctions based on many other organic molecules exhibiting large homo - lumo gaps . the light - induced effects ,",
    "if verified experimentally , could be used for detecting light , or as an optical gate ( or `` third terminal '' ) for purposes of switching .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s.gene ] we describe our theoretical approach , discuss the general properties of tb wire models , and introduce the green - function method for the calculation of the elastic transmission function .",
    "then , in sec.[s.phenyl ] we calculate the transmission function of oligophenylene wires analytically . the decay coefficient for the off - resonant transmission",
    "is extracted also from infinitely extended polyphenylene . following that , in sec .",
    "[ s.results ] we present our numerical results for the conductance , the thermopower , the photoconductance , and the @xmath2-@xmath3 characteristics .",
    "finally , sec.[s.discussion ] ends with our conclusions and some discussion .",

    "the arguments @xmath38 and @xmath1 distinguish it from the conductance @xmath20 , although we sometimes omit @xmath38 for notational simplicity .",

    "a self - consistent treatment would be in order in particular for asymmetrically coupled molecules .",
    "we only concentrate on left - right symmetric junctions , where where both the dc and ac voltages ( @xmath3 and @xmath41 ) are assumed to drop according to one of two different symmetrical profiles .",
    "the symmetry of the junctions excludes rectification effects , such as light - induced dc photocurrents in the absence of a dc bias voltage.@xcite however , light can still have a strong influence on the transmission properties of the molecular contact , as will be discussed below .",
    "it will be shown that our conclusions are essentially independent of the assumed voltage profile .",
    "below we will specialize to the case of a metal - oligophenylene - metal junction .",
    "however , to make some general remarks , let us first consider a larger class of molecular wires that can be described as @xmath21 separate units forming a chain , where only the nearest neighbors are coupled ( see fig .",
    "[ f.blockjunction ] ) .",
    "we only discuss the calculation of the elastic transmission function @xmath6 here , as this will be the focus of our analytical considerations in sec.[s.phenyl ] . from this quantity ( at @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the various linear - response coefficients such as the conductance and the thermopower can be extracted .",
    "furthermore , as already mentioned , it suffices for an approximate treatment of the amplitudes @xmath43 as well .",

    ". the inverse of the stationary - state retarded propagator for the coupled chain will then be of the form @xmath55 here @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "charge - transfer effects between the molecule and the metallic electrodes shift the molecular levels with respect to the fermi energy @xmath14 . in a tb model ,",
    "these can be represented by shifting the diagonal elements of @xmath61 .",
    "once a transport voltage @xmath3 is applied , further shifts are induced . in our model",
    "the voltage - induced shifts will be taken from simple model profiles , and the relative position of @xmath14 will be treated as a free parameter .",

    "thus , one can in principle obtain the decay exponent from the propagator of an isolated molecule , or even an infinitely extended polymer . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate this by extracting the decay exponent of a finite oligophenylene junction from the propagator for polyphenylene .",
    "we note that in doing so , we neglect the practical difficulty of determining the correct relative position of @xmath14 .",
    "there are efficient numerical methods for computing the lead self - energies for different types of electrodes and various bonding situations between them and the wire .",

    "[ f.diffc](a,b ) ] , in the low - bias regime [ fig .",

    "despite the differences in magnitudes of parameters , and slight asymmetries in the geometries , it is likely that some of those steps have essentially the same origin as explained above .",

    "in this paper we have studied a @xmath0-orbital tight - binding model to describe elastic and photoassisted transport through metal - molecule - metal contacts based on oligophenylenes .",

    "models of this type can be of value in analyzing the results of more detailed _ ab - initio _ or dft calculations,@xcite and in making at least qualitative predictions in situations where such calculations would be prohibitively costly .",
    "we first showed that at zero voltage bias the model can be studied analytically in a similar fashion as the simpler linear chain models .",
    "in particular , we derived an expression for the decay exponent of the off - resonant transmission function .",
    "we then discussed the length dependence of the dc conductance , the thermopower , and the relative light - induced conductance enhancement in the case of light with a low intensity ( @xmath38 ) and low frequency ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the conductance enhancement was found to scale quadratically with length . for large @xmath38 and @xmath1 , the relative enhancement increases exponentially with length .",
    "finally it was shown , by numerical calculations , that the current - voltage characteristics are modified in the presence of light by the appearance of side steps with a voltage spacing @xmath4 .",
    "we demonstrated that the predictions of the model are robust with respect to variations in the assumed voltage profiles .",
    "this provides further support for our previous results on the photoconductance.@xcite    in our work , only symmetrical junctions with symmetrical voltage profiles were studied .",
    "asymmetries can modify our results through the introduction of rectification effects,@xcite and can change the positions of the light - induced current steps .",
    "the experimental observation of additional steps with a spacing related to the frequency of the light would nevertheless provide more compelling evidence for the presence of photoassisted transport than a conductance enhancement alone .",
    "the latter can also have other causes.@xcite    we note that the light - induced current steps are similar to the steps observed in current - voltage characteristics of microwave - irradiated superconducting tunnel junctions , where they result from photoassisted quasiparticle tunneling.@xcite in that case , the main difference is that the energy gap necessary for the effect is located in the macroscopic electrodes , while the transmission through the tunnel barrier depends only weakly on energy and voltage . as a result ,",
    "the current steps have a voltage spacing of precisely @xmath281 .",
    "these effects are exploited in the detection of microwaves in radioastronomy.@xcite similarly , one may imagine properly engineered molecular contacts as detectors of light in the infrared or visible frequency range .    in terms of our model , to increase the chances of observing the light - induced current steps",
