    "interplay between strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling and electron - electron interaction in correlated electron systems has been a recent subject of intensive study @xcite . in particular , @xmath3 transition metal ( e.g.  iridium ( ir ) or osmium ( os ) ) oxides are regarded as ideal playgrounds for observing such cooperative effects @xcite . compared to @xmath4 transition metal oxides , the repulsive coulomb energy scale in these systems is reduced by the much larger extent of @xmath3 orbitals , while the so coupling is enhanced due to high atomic number ( @xmath5 for ir and @xmath6 for os ) . moreover , owing to the extended @xmath3 orbitals , these systems are very sensitive to the crystal fields . as a result , the energy scales mentioned above often become comparable to each other , leading to a variety of competing phases . precisely for this reason , one expects to see newer emergent quantum phases in such systems .",
    "indeed , there have been several theoretical proposals , in context of concrete experimental examples , for spin liquids @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , weyl semimetals @xcite , novel magnetically ordered mott insulators @xcite and other related phases @xcite in iridium and osmium oxides .",
    "a typical situation in the iridates consist of ir@xmath7 atoms sitting in the octahedral crystal field of a chalcogen , typically oxygen or sulphur @xcite .",
    "this octahedral crystal field splits the five @xmath3 orbitals of ir into the doubly degenerate @xmath8 orbitals and the triply degenerate @xmath9 orbitals ( each orbital has a further two - fold spin degeneracy ) .",
    "the @xmath8 orbitals are higher in energy with the energy difference being approximately @xmath10",
    ". there are 5 electrons in the outermost @xmath3 shell of ir@xmath7 which occupy the low lying @xmath9 orbitals and the low energy physics is effectively described by projecting out the empty @xmath8 orbitals @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of most of the approaches used to understand these compounds is to treat the so coupling as the strongest interaction at the atomic level ; _ i.e. _ , by considering the effect of extremely strong so coupling for electrons occupying the @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "this decides the nature of the participating atomic orbitals in the low energy effective theory . in this limit ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum , projected to the @xmath9 manifold , carries an effective orbital angular momentum @xmath11 with a negative so coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the projected so coupling splits the @xmath9 manifold into the lower @xmath12 quadruplet and the upper @xmath0 doublet .",
    "out of the five valence electrons , four fill up the quadruplet sector leaving the doublet sector half filled .",
    "thus , in the limit of very strong so coupling , the half filled doublet sector emerge as the correct low energy degrees of freedom . considering the effect of coulomb repulsion within a hubbard model description and performing strong coupling expansion , various spin hamiltonians for @xmath0",
    "are then derived within a strong - coupling perturbation theory @xcite .    in this paper , we , however , consider a different limit where the oxygen octahedra surrounding the ir@xmath7 ions are highly distorted . while the above scenario of half filled @xmath0 orbitals is applicable to undistorted case , as we shall see ,",
    "it breaks down in presence of strong distortions of the octahedra .",
    "in particular , we consider the effect of trigonal distortions , which may be relevant for some of the iridate systems including the much debated honeycomb lattice iridate , na@xmath1iro@xmath2 . we show that , in this limit , a different  doublet \" of orbitals emerge as the low energy degree of freedom .",
    "this doublet forms a pseudo - spin-@xmath13 that results from a kind of ( physical)spin - orbital _ locking _ , so that the spin and orbital fluctuations are not separable ( as discussed below ) .",
    "we emphasize that this pseudo - spin is different from the @xmath14 doublet discussed above .",
    "the spin hamiltonian for these pseudo - spins ( eq .  [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) , on a honeycomb lattice , admits a 4-sub - lattice _ zig - zag _",
    "[ fig_zig_zag ] ) pattern in a relevant parameter regime .",
    "such magnetic order has been recently observed in the experiments @xcite on na@xmath1iro@xmath2 and hence our theory may be applicable to this material .    the distortion of the octahedron surrounding the ir@xmath7 generates a new energy scale associated with the change in the crystal field , which , as we shall see , competes with the so coupling .",
    "several kinds of distortion may occur , of which we consider the trigonal distortions of the octahedron where it is stretched / compressed along the body diagonal of the enclosing cube @xcite . in the absence",
    "so coupling , such trigonal crystal field splits the @xmath9 manifold into @xmath15 ( with two degenerate orbitals @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and non - degenerate @xmath18 ( again there is an added two - fold spin degeneracy for each of these orbitals ) .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath18 levels are respectively occupied by three and two electrons in ir@xmath19 . for large trigonal distortions ,",
    "the splitting between them is big and the @xmath18 orbitals can be projected out .",
    "now , if one adds so coupling , the low energy degrees of freedom is described by a subspace of the @xmath20 orbitals which form an emergent pseudo - spin-1/2 doublet out of @xmath21 and @xmath22 states , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the physical spin @xmath25 ( the spins are quantized along the axis of trigonal distortion ) .",
    "these pseudo - spin-@xmath13 is different from the @xmath0 and @xmath12 multiplets in the strong so coupling limit as discussed above . notice the ( physical)spin - orbital _ locking _ for the pseudo - spins , as alluded above .    the two approaches , described in the last two paragraphs , of arriving at the low energy manifold are mutually incompatible .",
    "this can be seen as follows : in presence of sizeable trigonal distortions the @xmath0 and @xmath12 multiplets mix with each other and can no longer serve as good low energy atomic orbitals .",
    "this dichotomy becomes quite evident in the recent studies of na@xmath1iro@xmath2 , where , the @xmath26 form a honeycomb lattice .",
    "taking into account the strong so coupling of ir@xmath19 in na@xmath1iro@xmath2 , proposed are a model for a topological insulator in the weak interaction limit @xcite and a heisenberg - kitaev ( hk ) model for a possible spin liquid phase in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "these proposals prompted several experimental @xcite and theoretical efforts @xcite to understand the nature of the ground state in this material .",
    "subsequently , it was found that na@xmath1iro@xmath2 orders magnetically at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic moments form a  zig - zag \" pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig_zig_zag ] ) which is not consistent with the ones that would be obtained by adding a weak interaction in a topological insulator ( canted antiferromagnet ) @xcite or from a nearest neighbour hk model ( spin liquid or the so - called stripe antiferromagnet ) @xcite . while recent studies @xcite",
    "show that a ` zig - zag ' order may be stabilized within the hk model by including substantial second and third neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions , it is hard to justify such large further neighbour exchanges without lattice distortions .",
    "( an alternate explanation that we do not pursue here is significant charge fluctuations which would mean that the compound is close to metal - insulator transition .",
    "the resistivity data seems to support the fact that this compound is a good insulator .",
    "@xcite ) if lattice distortions are responsible for the significant further neighbour exchanges , then , there would be sizeable distortion of the oxygen octahedra , which in turn may invalidate the above @xmath0 picture and thus the basic paradigm of the hk model , by mixing the @xmath27=1/2 and @xmath12 subspaces .",
    "recent finite temperature numerical calculations on the hk model @xcite also suggest possible inconsistencies with experiments on na@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",
    "this necessitates the need for a different starting point , to explain the magnetic properties of na@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",
    "[ fig_zig_zag ]    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_hamiltonian ]",
    ", we derive the effective spin hamiltonian in limit of the large trigonal distortion and large so coupling .",
    "this is done by taking the energy scale associated with trigonal distortion to infinity first , followed by that of the so energy scale .",
    "this order of taking the limit gives a spin hamiltonian in terms of emergent pseudo - spin@xmath28 , which is different from the hk model .",
    "this hamiltonian is both anisotropic and frustrated .",
    "it also has further neighbour interactions , the effect of which are enhanced due to anisotropy that makes some of the nearest neighbour bonds weaker . the origin of this anisotropy is trigonal distortion . we argue that this limit may be more applicable for the compound na@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",

    "although it is possible that the axes of trigonal distortions are different in different octahedra @xcite , we find that uniform distortions are more consistent with the experiments ( see below ) on na@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",

    "we note that the hund s coupling ( which arises from the orbital dependence of the coulomb repulsion ) for the @xmath9 orbitals only renormalizes @xmath47 in this restricted subspace .",

    "when it is strong in one direction ( @xmath88 ) and weak in two other directions ( @xmath90 ) , for the bonds where the nn coupling becomes weak , the effects of the small second and third neighbour interactions become significant . since the latter interactions are antiferromagnetic , they prefer anti - parallel alignment of the spins",

    "the relation between the magnetic moment and the pseudo - spins is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the bohr magneton .",
    "this follows from the twin facts that , in @xmath20 subspace , the angular momentum transverse to @xmath33 is quenched and the spins are locked to the orbitals with the axis of quantization being @xmath33 in our pseudo - spin sector ( see [ appen_zeeman ] ) .",
