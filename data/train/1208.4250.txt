    "stellar modelling of b - type main - sequence stars is benefiting greatly from seismic data of @xmath26cep stars . among the various classes of b - type pulsators",
    "( e.g. chapter2 of aerts et al.@xcite ) this is the only one with members having clearly identified values for the wavenumbers @xmath27 for several of the detected oscillation modes , which is a prerequisite for successful seismic modelling .",
    "models based on standard input physics could satisfactorily explain seismic data of the @xmath26cep stars v836cen ( aerts et al.@xcite ; dupret et al.@xcite ) , @xmath26cma ( mazumdar et al.@xcite ) , @xmath28ceti ( aerts et al.@xcite ) , and @xmath29oph ( briquet et al.@xcite ) .",
    "however , models with the same input physics failed to explain the much richer seismic constraints assembled from huge multi - technique multisite campaigns organised during many months for the @xmath26cep stars @xmath30eri ( de ridder et al.@xcite ; pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski@xcite ; ausseloos et al.@xcite ) and 12lac ( handler et al.@xcite ; dziembowski & pamyatnykh@xcite ; desmet et al.@xcite ) .",
    "these campaigns led to more than twice the number of modes known previously in those two stars , among which there were one or two high - order @xmath31-modes , and revealed shortcomings in the excitation predictions for some modes .",
    "a similar excitation problem occurred for @xmath32peg , a class member found to pulsate in several high - order @xmath31-modes and low - order @xmath33-modes from most space - based photometry ( handler et al.@xcite ; walczak & daszyska - daszkiewicz@xcite ) .",
    "zdravkov & pamyatnykh@xcite suggested that an increase in the opacities by 20% might solve the excitation problem of @xmath32peg .",
    "another excitation problem was pointed out for one mode of the corot target v1449 aql ( aerts et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the recent detection and interpretation of @xmath26cep - type modes in the o9v pulsator hd46202 ( briquet et al.@xcite ) with corot observations showed that the excitation problem of massive pulsators is acute , since none of the detected modes is predicted to be excited for appropriate stellar models representing this star .",
    "in all these studies , the effects of rotation on the excitation and amplitude of modes were not or only partly treated .",
    "non - adiabatic computations taking rotation into account of the excitation of modes are available ( e.g. lee@xcite ; townsend@xcite ) but those of the amplitude of modes are just starting to become available ( lee@xcite ) . these calculations will be very useful to check whether a better agreement between observed and theoretically excited modes may be found .",
    "an important result of these asteroseismic studies is the evidence for non - rigid interior rotation in some @xmath0  cep stars .",
    "it was shown that v836  cen , @xmath34  eri and 12  lac rotate more rapidly in their inner parts than at their surface .",
    "these works also allow us to test whether core overshooting has to be included in our stellar models .",
    "overshooting represents here the amount of non - standard mixing processes ( maeder@xcite ; mathis@xcite ) . for most of the @xmath0  cep targets modelled so far , the conclusion was the need for core overshooting for a better agreement with the pulsational characteristics . the derived core overshooting parameter values are however small ( around 0.10 local pressure scale heights for v836  cen and hd46202 , and around 0.20 for @xmath35  ceti , @xmath0  cma , and 12  lac ) with the exception of @xmath25  oph for which the value was found to be around 0.40 . for two cases , @xmath34  eri and v1449 aql ,",
    "the core overshooting parameter could be kept to zero .",
    "space - based observations revealed other pulsators than @xmath32peg with both @xmath31- and @xmath33-mode pulsations of spb and @xmath0  cep types ( balona et al.@xcite ) .",
    "for the corot hybrid hd  50230 , the observation of deviations from a uniform period spacing led to the first exploration of the regions adjacent to the core in a massive star ( degroote et al.@xcite ) .",
    "hd  43317 was discovered by corot to be another hybrid star with a wealth of pulsational constraints but also showing the presence of chemical inhomogeneities at its stellar surface ( ppics et al.@xcite ) . before space - based asteroseismology , the simultaneous presence of both pulsation and rotational modulation was found from ground - based spectroscopy only in @xmath0  cep ( telting , aerts & mathias@xcite ) , v2052  oph ( neiner et al.@xcite ) , and @xmath36  sco ( uytterhoeven et al.@xcite ) .",
    "another important discovery by means of space - based corot data is the first observation of stochastically excited gravito - inertial modes in a massive star .",
    "such modes have recently been detected in the hot ( o9.5-b0 ) pulsator hd51452 ( neiner et al . , submitted ) , and this type of excitation should probably be more widely considered for massive pulsators .    among @xmath0  cep stars with an asteroseismic modelling",
    ", a magnetic field has been detected so far in @xmath0  cep ( henrichs et al.@xcite ; shibahashi & aerts@xcite ) and in v1449 aql ( hubrig et al.@xcite ; aerts et al.@xcite ) , although the field of the latter is still a matter of debate ( shultz et al.@xcite ) . in order to understand the effect of a magnetic field on the seismic behaviour of @xmath26cep stars ,",
    "a multisite photometric and spectroscopic campaign was set up for the equatorial star v2052  oph ( @xmath37=@xmath38 , spectral type b2iv / v ) , which is known to be a magnetic pulsator with a dominant radial mode of frequency 7.145 d@xmath3 and a rotation frequency of 0.275 d@xmath3 ( neiner et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the star is slightly enriched in he , revealed a mild n excess ( morel et al.@xcite ) , and was considered to be suitable as a seismic target , in view of the identified dominant radial mode and the discovery of an additional low - amplitude non - radial mode by neiner et al.@xcite .",
    "the multisite photometry of v2052  oph is reported in a companion paper by handler et al.@xcite . here , we present the spectroscopic part of the campaign . after a description of our dataset in sect.[sect_data ] , we discuss the atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of the star ( sect.[sect_parameters ] ) .",
    "sect.[sect_lpv ] is devoted to our frequency analysis and mode identification .",
    "besides our line - profile study , we make a comparison with stellar models ( sect.[sect_modelling ] ) .",
    "we end with a discussion about the inhibition of mixing by magnetism and conclusions in sect.[sect_discussion ] and sect.[sect_conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     the parameters for @xmath25  oph are taken from briquet et al.@xcite .",
    "[ compar ]    we first used the criterion from eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) in zahn@xcite , which is based on the equation of angular momentum transport taking into account the magnetic field derived by mathis & zahn@xcite : @xmath39 in this equation , we used the time already spent by v2052  oph on the main sequence , its radius and mass , as well as the surface rotation velocity .",
    "we found that the mean critical field strength in the radiative zone for suppressing differential rotation in this star is @xmath40@xmath4170  g. according to the ratio ( 30 ) between internal and surface fields derived by braithwaite ( 2008 ; see fig.8 therein ) , this corresponds to a critical field strength at the surface of @xmath42=@xmath43  g. although the zahn criterion is an approximation and we took global parameter values in our numerical application , it provides a good idea that a very weak fossil magnetic field is enough to inhibit possible initial differential rotation and thus rotational mixing in v2052  oph or similar early b stars .",
    "thus the surface magnetic field of 400  g present in v2052  oph is strong enough and v2052  oph is rotating uniformly considering the approximations of the zahn criterion .",
    "we then considered the criterion from eq .",
    "( 22 ) defined by spruit@xcite , which provides the critical initial field strength above which the magnetic field remains non - axisymmetric and rotation becomes uniform : @xmath44 in this equation we consider the radiative zone . from our cls models we derived that this radiative zone encompasses 81% of the stellar mass and its average density is 0.07 g  @xmath45 . in addition , we assumed that the initial rotational velocity in the radiative zone is a few times the current surface rotation velocity .",
    "we used a magnetic diffusivity of @xmath46 , typical of the radiative zone of a b2 star ( brun , private communication ; see also augustson , brun & toomre@xcite ) and a degree of differential rotation ( @xmath47 ; eq .",
    "( 13 ) of spruit@xcite ) equal to 1 following spruit  @xcite .",
    "we obtain that the initial critical field is @xmath48@xmath41430  g. using again the ratio provided by braithwaite@xcite , but this time between the radiative zone and the surface , i.e. typically a factor 10 , the critical initial surface field is @xmath49@xmath4140  g. the corresponding current critical surface field is below this value , because of dissipation caused by the ohmic diffusion and the uniform rotation state caused by the lorentz torque .",
    "again , the spruit criterion is based on approximations .",
    "nevertheless , it shows that the surface magnetic field observed in v2052  oph ( 400  g ) is sufficient to explain the observed non - axisymmetric magnetic configuration and lack of mixing associated to uniform rotation .",
    "more precise criteria extracted from detailed modelling , in particular taking into account the full coupled transport processes and the geometrical configuration ( for example following mathis & zahn@xcite ; spada , lanzafame & lanza@xcite ; duez & mathis@xcite ; duez , braithwaite & mathis@xcite ) , are required to determine more precisely the level of magnetic field necessary to inhibit mixing in b stars .",
    "nevertheless , our first estimate with both criteria above confirm that it is probably the presence of a fossil magnetic field in v2052  oph that reduces the core overshooting parameter , i.e. the amount of non - standard mixing processes .    as a consequence of our findings ,",
    "the usual interpretation that rotational mixing is responsible for the n - enrichment observed in early b - type stars ( meynet et al.@xcite ) can not be applied to v2052  oph .",
    "preliminary results of bourge et al.@xcite showed that radiatively - driven microscopic diffusion may be an alternative explanation for this abundance peculiarity in v2052  oph and other targets .",
    "complete diffusion computations including radiative forces in @xmath0  cep - type stars , which are not yet available , should include magnetic fields as there seems to be a higher incidence of nitrogen overabundance in stars with a detected magnetic field of the same order ( i.e. a few hundred gauss ) as the one detected in v2052  oph ( morel et al.@xcite ) .",
    "our study was based on extensive ground - based , high - resolution , high - s / n , multisite spectroscopic measurements spread over many years . similar efforts were already performed for two other @xmath0  cep stars , @xmath34  eri and 12  lac , leading to around ten independent pulsation frequencies . for v2052  oph , our campaign only led to the detection of three pulsation modes but , contrary to the two other cases , the rotation period is also found , which provides a strong additional constraint .",
    "the difficulty to detect more modes in v2052  oph may be explained by lower amplitudes of the modes due to a higher rotation rate compared to the two other stars .",
    "comparing our identifications of the degrees of the modes with the ones coming from the photometry , we are confident that the dominant mode is radial while the two additional modes have @xmath10=@xmath50 . moreover , combining the outcome of the fpf method with that of our basic modelling , we conclude that the non - radial modes are prograde @xmath11=@xmath12 or @xmath13 components of two multiplets with @xmath51=@xmath22 and @xmath51=@xmath20 .",
    "the surface equatorial rotational velocity was also deduced as @xmath52=73@xmath532 km  s@xmath3 .    the observation of three independent modes with constraints on their wavenumbers along with the rotation period was enough to deduce ranges for the mass ( @xmath14\\ $ ] m@xmath15 ) , central hydrogen abundance ( @xmath16 $ ] ) and other parameters of v2052  oph that are furthermore fully compatible with the spectroscopic @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and with the inclination angle @xmath56 determined from the modelling of the magnetic field",
    ". more importantly , we showed that only models with no or mild core overshooting could satisfactorily reproduce our observational properties .",
    "we made a comparison with @xmath25  oph because it is an asteroseismically modelled @xmath0  cep star having similar fundamental parameters as our object of interest .",
    "we would expect a larger core overshooting parameter value in the faster rotator but the contrary is found . it can be explained by the fact that v2052  oph is a magnetic star while @xmath25  oph is not . indeed , using two approximate criteria , we showed that the magnetic field present in v2052  oph is strong enough to inhibit non - standard mixing processes in its interior . in order to check if the internal rotation of v2052  oph is indeed uniform or not",
    ", we would need additional constraints such as those obtained from a high - precision light curve as given by the corot and kepler satellites .",
    "indeed , space - based photometry has already revealed many pulsation frequencies , even in objects that were thought to be monoperiodic from the ground ( aerts et al.@xcite ; degroote et al.@xcite ) .",
