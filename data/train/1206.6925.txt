    "squeezing is a basic concept for various branches of physics and is applicable for many subjects .",

    "for example , this state appears in particle creation @xcite and is used to calculate effective potential @xcite .",
    "the important property is the relation of fluctuations of conjugate variables .",
    "only a coherent state does not minimize the uncertainty relation , but a squeezed state also does .",
    "domains will be formed in some processes .",
    "for instance , it is expected that a domain is formed in a chiral phase transition .",
    "the condensate is a spatial dependent in such a phenomenon , and the spatial dependence indicates a domain formation .",
    "the condensate is described by a coherent state which is constructed by a displacement operator@xcite .",
    "fluctuation is also an important quantity and is related to mass modification .",
    "it was pointed out that mass modification is related to particle correlation @xcite",
    ". the fluctuation will be spatial dependent on a domain like condensate in some systems , and a squeezed state is a candidate to describe the fluctuation .",
    "the naive extension of one mode squeeze operator in quantum mechanics does not work well in quantum field theory , because of infinite volume .",
    "the divergence is easily shown when the state constructed by the squeeze operator is used .",
    "this divergence is removed by introducing smeared creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to find the squeezed state that describes a spatial dependent fluctuation without the divergence caused by infinite volume , because this state is related directly to observables .",
    "physical quantities will be calculated when the squeezed state is given .    in this paper , we attempt to describe a domain by a squeezed state without the divergence .",
    "we use an extended squeeze operator , and construct the squeezed state to describe a spherical domain : the distributions of the condensate and of the fluctuation are gaussian .",
    "the momentum distribution , chaoticity and correlation length are calculated by using the obtained squeezed state .",
    "it is demonstrated that the momentum distribution reflects the size of the domain , and that the chaoticity reflects the ratio of the size of the squeezed region to that of the coherent region .",
    "contrarily , the results imply that the quantum state describing a domain is surmised by studying the momentum distribution and the chaoticity under the assumption that the distributions of the condensate and the fluctuation are gaussian .",
