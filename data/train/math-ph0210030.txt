    "second , kirillov , kontsevich , and molev @xcite studied the lie algebra @xmath58 generated by two vector fields on @xmath59 in general position , conjectured that @xmath60=0 \\quad\\forall x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,y\\in l\\ ] ] generates all identities , and calculated the dimensions of its homogeneous subspaces and the asymptotic growth of their dimension .",
    "if their conjecture is true , @xmath58 is a _ pi - algebra _",
    "@xcite , one which the identities which hold in the lie algebra ( such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : standard4 ] ) ) are satisfied by _ all _ elements of the lie algebra .",
    "returning to the case of simple mechanical systems , it is clear that every lie bracket of @xmath8 and @xmath5 is a homogeneous polynomial in @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the degrees of these polynomials combine in a natural way .",
    "we therefore introduce the following class @xmath61 of lie algebras .",
    "we use the notation @xmath62 : = [ x , y]$ ] , @xmath63:=[x,[y , z]]$ ] , and for sets @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 : = [ \\x,\\y ] : = \\{[x , y]\\colon x\\in\\x , y\\in\\y\\}$ ] .",

    "we call the grading of @xmath58 its grading by degree .    for example , the lie algebra generated by kinetic and potential energy is of class @xmath61 , where the grading is by total degree in @xmath31 .",
    "the lie algebra of all polynomial vector fields on a linear space is of class @xmath61 , where the grading is by total degree",
    ". we will give more examples later .",
    "such a grading is quite different from the natural grading of a free lie algebra .",
    "two important differences are that ( i ) it is not abelian . for , @xmath71 = 0 $ ] while @xmath72\\subseteq l_0 $ ] .",
    "( ii ) it is not finite , in the sense that elements of @xmath68 are lie brackets of unboundedly many other elements of @xmath58 . for example , the bracket of any number of elements of degree 1 is still of degree 1 .",
    "we also need the concept of a lie algebra which is free in a certain class .",
    "@xcite let @xmath73 be a lie algebra of class @xmath61 generated by a set @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath73 is called a free lie algebra in the class @xmath61 , freely generated by the set @xmath64 , if for any lie algebra @xmath74 of class @xmath61 , every mapping @xmath75 can be extended to a unique homomorphism @xmath76 .",
    "we write @xmath77 .",
    "in addition to the grading by degree , @xmath78 also carries the standard grading which we call the grading by _ order _ , generated by @xmath79 for all generators @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) = { \\mathop{\\rm order}}(y)+{\\mathop{\\rm order}}(z)$ ] .",
    "( the term _ order _ is chosen here because it corresponds to order in the sense of numerical integrators , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aba ] ) ) .    because of the importance of the grading by degree for lie algebras generated by kinetic and potential energy , we make the following definition .    the lie algebra @xmath82 , free in the class @xmath61 , where @xmath11 has degree 2 and @xmath12 has degree 0 , is called the lie algebra of classical mechanics .",
    "two lie algebras of class @xmath61 are easy to describe .",
    "first , the lie algebra with @xmath41 generators of degree @xmath83 which is free in the class @xmath61 is just the standard free lie algebra on @xmath41 generators  the degrees can never decrease if the lie algebra has no elements of degree 0 .",
    "second , the lie algebra with generators @xmath84 of degree 0 and generators @xmath85 of degree 1 , free in the class @xmath61 , is @xmath86 $ ] , and only contains elements of degree 0 and 1 .",
    "( in both of these cases , the grading by degree is in fact abelian . )",
    "however , we want to describe the lie algebra of classical mechanics , @xmath87 .",
    "this is the simplest nontrivial case as it includes the essential feature of @xmath61 that degrees can both increase and decrease under lie brackets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a construction which describes @xmath82 as the direct sum of an abelian and a free lie algebra , both with an infinite number of generators . in section 3 ,",
    "we enumerate the dimensions of the homogeneous ( by order ) components of @xmath82 and hence in section 4 numerically compute its entropy .",
    "section 5 considers special cases ( e.g. , of mechanical systems with euclidean metric ; these turn out not to be free in the class @xmath61 ) and other examples of polynomially - graded lie algebras .",
    "let @xmath88 be the unique homomorphism from the free lie algebra to the free lie algebra of class @xmath61 .",
    "the kernel @xmath89 can be thought of as the set of identities of @xmath82 .",
    "for example , we showed above ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : vvvt ] ) ) that @xmath90\\in\\ker\\psi$ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath91\\in\\ker\\psi$ ] for all @xmath92 .",
    "however , we will see below that @xmath90 $ ] is not the only generator of the ideal @xmath89 .",
    "our description of @xmath82 is based on the following two observations .",
    "first , suppose one wants to describe the lie algebra with three generators @xmath93 which is free in the class of lie algebras with @xmath94 .",
    "since @xmath57 generates all identities in this class , this lie algebra is just @xmath24 : one merely has to drop the generator @xmath57 .",
    "to generalize this idea , suppose the free lie algebra @xmath24 can be factored as @xmath95 for certain generating sets @xmath96 with elements in @xmath24 , such that some subset @xmath65 of @xmath97 generates all the identities in @xmath61 .",
    "then , we have @xmath98 again , we merely drop these generators .",
    "if @xmath65 only generates _ some _ of the identities of @xmath61 , then dropping these generators gives a sum of free lie algebras which is surjectively homomorphic to @xmath87 .",
    "this can be used to get upper bounds for the dimensions of the homogeneous subspaces of @xmath87 .",
    "second , given a description of @xmath87 as such a sum ( eq . [ eq : sum ] ) of free lie algebras , we can apply standard techniques to describe it in detail , for example to construct bases , to compute its dimensions with respect to degree and/or order , and to compute the asymptotic growth of these dimensions .",
    "we begin by stating the crucial tool we shall use , the lazard factorization of free lie algebras .",
    "@xcite let @xmath64 and @xmath65 be sets of generators",
    ". then @xmath99).\\ ] ]    applying the lazard factorization to @xmath24 with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , gives @xmath102,[bba],[bbba],\\dots)\\ ] ] where the elements @xmath103 $ ] for @xmath104 are all identities in @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath82 is surjectively homomorphic to @xmath105,[bba])$ ] .",
    "the three generators have degrees 2 ( @xmath11 ) , 1 ( @xmath106 $ ] ) , and 0 ( @xmath107 $ ] ) .",
    "the idea now is to eliminate this new element of degree 0 .",
    "( formally , the generators @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 , do remain in the generating set ; but they and all succeeding lie brackets of them will be dropped at the final stage when we pass to @xmath87 , so we do not need to keep track of them and just indicate them by @xmath108 . ) this gives @xmath109,[bba ] , * ) \\cr & \\cong b \\oplus [ bba ] \\oplus l(a,[ba],[bba , a],[bba , ba],[bba , bba , a]),*)}\\ ] ] where the generators now have degrees 2 , 1 , 1 , 0 , and 0 respectively .",
    "continuing in this way we get the following .",
    "let the degree of @xmath11 be 2 and the degree of @xmath12 be 0 with respect to the polynomial grading ( eq . [ eq : degree ] ) .",
    "then for all @xmath110 we have the following isomorphism , @xmath111 where @xmath112 , \\cr     \\y_0=\\{b\\},\\quad \\y_{k+1 } & = [ \\y_k,\\x_k]\\cup [ \\y_k,\\y_k , a ]   = [ \\y_k,\\x_{k+1 } ] , \\cr     \\z_0=\\emptyset,\\quad \\z_{k+1 } & = \\z_k \\cup \\y_k , \\cr } \\ ] ] and @xmath108 represents generators which are zero in @xmath61 , i.e. , elements of the kernel of the homomorphism @xmath113 .",
    "the generating sets have the following properties :    1 .",
    "all elements of @xmath114 and @xmath115 have degree 0 , and all elements of @xmath116 have degree 1",

    "4 .   all elements of @xmath114 and @xmath115 have odd order , and all elements of @xmath116 have even order .",

    "the sizes of the sets @xmath116 and @xmath114 obey the iteration @xmath130 with initial conditions @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "this iteration generates the sequence of @xmath133 values @xmath134 there is a constant @xmath135 such that for sufficiently large @xmath41 , @xmath136 $ ] .    the iteration results from successive elimination of elements of degree 0 , each iteration introducing only a finite number of new elements nonzero in @xmath61 , which have degrees 0 and 1 .",
    "the other points then follow easily .",
    "the final description of @xmath82 , eq . ( [ eq : main ] ) , follows because the generators of @xmath137 have degree 2 ( @xmath11 ) , 1 ( @xmath64 ) , or are identically zero ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath137 contains no elements of degree 0 , so @xmath138 . the sequence of eq .",

    "the rapid growth of the sets @xmath116 and @xmath114 means that it is impossible to carry out the iteration exactly very far . in practice the generating set @xmath124",
    "can be found up to any order @xmath35 by dropping any terms of order @xmath139 as soon they appear in @xmath114 ( i.e. , by quotienting all lie algebras by the ideal consisting of all elements of order @xmath139 ) .",

    "we name the elements of @xmath124 @xmath142 , @xmath143 as they are successively generated by the algorithm .",
    "this gives a short description of the elements of @xmath144 of order @xmath145 in terms of 14 elements of degree 0 , 14 elements of degree 1 , and 1 element of degree 2 , which generate a total of 283 elements of weight @xmath145 ( see tables 2 and 3 ) .",
