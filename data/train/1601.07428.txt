    "since the beginning of the last century , when some astronomers started to study the matter content of our neighborhood @xcite , many evidences have been collected leading one to believe that the universe in which we live is mainly constituted by non - luminous matter , whose existence is inferred through its gravitational effects on the remaining constituents of the universe . this  missing matter \" , was dubbed  dunkle materie \" ( dark matter ) , by @xcite .",
    "nowadays , we know , according to plank s data mission fitted with the @xmath0cdm model , that the universe is composed of 26.8% non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) and 68.3% dark energy ( represented by the @xmath0 term ) , and just 4.9% ordinary matter @xcite . in this context , the role of gravitational lensing ( gl ) can hardly be overestimated .",
    "gl provides important evidences in favor of dm existence in galactic clusters @xcite .",
    "the other application of gl , following the idea by @xcite , deals with the searches for compact objects in the galactic halo and inside the milky way @xcite .",
    "gl effects over a wide range of lens masses can give us the possibility of analyzing the dm substructure characteristics ; especially it can give us a clue to solve the `` missing satellite '' problem @xcite .",
    "here we analyze the possibilities to study some properties of dm using mainly photometric information induced by gravitational microlensing effects .",
    "following the terminology adopted by the gl community , at least three kinds of gl phenomena , characterized by different lens masses and typical timescales , exist :    1 .   macrolensing and the weak lensing by galaxies or groups of galaxies;[type_i ] 2 .",
    "mesolensing : lenses are globular clusters , dwarf galaxies or dm clusters with mass in the range 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 @xcite;[type_ii ] 3 .   microlensing",
    ": lenses are stellar - mass objects.[type_iii ]    as distinct from [ type_i ] and [ type_ii ] dealing with almost static situations or very slow processes , the characteristic timescales of microlensing events in the milky way are of the order of weeks and in case of extragalactic microlensing events , they are of the order of months or years .",
    "this makes image brightness variation effects due to [ type_iii ] quite observable .",
    "based on the lens mass range / timescales , this terminology determines at the same time the possible observational appearance of these effects , i.e. multiple correlated static images with signal arrival time delays in the macrolensing case , slowly - varying distorted images due to mesolensing , and high amplification events on lightcurves when the source crosses the caustic of a microlens .",
    "dark matter can manifest itself at the three mentioned levels , namely :    1 .",
    "large haloes of dm with mass greater than @xmath4 can play the role of macrolenses ; the most prominent example is the `` bullet cluster''@xcite ; 2 .",
    "dm subhaloes of intermediate masses can play the role of mesolenses , causing the anomalous flux ratios , image distortions @xcite and additional time delays @xcite in extragalactic gravitational lens systems .",
    "several candidates to show anomalous flux ratios are known today , e.g. , b2045 + 265 @xcite , rx j11311231 , b1608 + 656 , wfi 2033  4723 @xcite , b1938 + 666 @xcite , and we would especially like to stress here the famous gls q2237 + 0305 for its sharp high - amplification microlensing events @xcite .",
    "clumps of dm with stellar masses can play the role of microlenses , leading to both photometric ( high amplification events ) and astrometric ( jump - like shifts of brightness centroid of the images of the microlensed source ) appearances .",
    "the main difference between dm microlensing and the `` usual '' one due to stars or black holes lies in the non - negligible size of the dm clumps ( non - dm microlenses are always considered as point masses ) .    in this paper",
    ", we pay attention to the last item , i.e. microlensing by extended clumps of stellar masses .",
    "we note that continuous observations by eros , ogle and other groups @xcite neither revealed any sign of these extended clumps in the galactic halo , nor provided any proof of such structures inside the galaxy .",
    "the overwhelming majority of the light curves observed for galactic microlensing events are well described by the gravitational field of stars ( and , sometimes , of planetary mass objects ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that there is no room for the stellar mass extended clumps .",
    "however , in this paper we show that the light curves due to extended clumps of stellar mass objects can mimic the light curves caused by ordinary compact objects .",
    "therefore , more detailed investigation is needed in order to rule out ( or to confirm ) the existence of these dm clumps that may either not be very numerous ( so that we do not have these clumps within our solar system ) or not so dense to be observable .",
    "photometric signatures of dm substructure via gravitational microlensing have been widely discussed ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "there are also some investigations of variability of spectral line profiles @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived amplification distributions for static gravitational macro - lensing with a non - constant surface mass density , which includes the cases of a stochastic system of gaussian clumps and clumps in the form of truncated singular isothermal spheres .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite have considered a model of microlensing due to a non - compact neutralino star .    in this paper",
    "we use several other models of dm clumps to analyze the observational appearance of dm microlensing within different cosmological models .",
    "we focus our attention on item [ type_iii ] to compare the observational appearances of microlensed sources due to point - like and finite - size dm clump deflectors and determine how one can distinguish an extended dm clump microlensing event from a `` regular '' one in case of galactic and extragalactic structures . the main question we want to answer concerns the possibilities to detect signals from these putative extended mass structures and to estimate the accuracy needed to characterize such effects mainly from observed light curves .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the existing dm models . in section 3",
    ", we propose a `` toy model '' , which describes , for special choices of the parameters , microlensing by various types of extended structures .",
    "the model is based on the deflection angle @xmath5 , where @xmath6 characterizes the effective size of a clump core ] .",
    "for different choices of parameters , this model reproduces the effects either due to point microlenses , or cdm minihaloes with a cusped density profile , or sidm clumps with a cored density profile . in section 4",
    "we discuss the superpositions of extended and point - mass deflecting objects . in the case of isolated microlenses",
    "these models can be used to describe microlensing events within the galaxy .",
    "we perform a numerical comparison of these events considering different microlens models .",
    "namely , we calculate the `` amplification curves '' , that is the dependence of the total amplification of a microlensing system versus time , as the lens moves with respect to the line - of - sight to the source .",
    "we also pay some attention to the trajectories of the brightness centroid of the microlensed images , because the fast progress in the positional accuracy measurements gives us a hope to detect the astrometric signatures of gravitational microlensing in the near future .    in section 5",
    "we consider the observational behavior of clumps in extragalactic glss .",
    "namely , we study the statistical effects of gravitational microlensing due to a stochastic system composed of extended dm clumps and point masses .",
    "there is a number of papers dealing with statistical subjects of microlensing systems ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our technique is essentially the same as that used by @xcite and @xcite , followed by a number of authors ; cf . especially considerations by @xcite dealing with brightness variations in connection to the problem of anomalous brightness ratios .",
    "unlike in the previous works we deal with the autocorrelation functions ( acfs ) of the amplification curves for our concrete model of a microlensing system .",
    "we generate an ensemble of amplification curves for a fixed input of randomly distributed clumps and point mass microlenses in the total optical depth ; this enables us to derive acfs for these amplification curves as a function of different clump contribution , size and in presence of an external shear .",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss the results .",
    "dm microstructure still remains the subject of debates ; there are many hypotheses about dm particles @xcite .",
    "cold dark matter is supposed to contain heavy particles , weakly interacting with each other and with baryonic matter ( axions or wimps ) , and warm dark matter ( wdm ) consists of light , fast - moving particles ( sterile neutrinos , champs , neutralinos or gravitinos ) , which tend less to form small - scale compact structures @xcite .",
    "self - interacting dark matter can be considered as a particular kind of cold one with a nonzero impact distance for the interaction between dm particles @xcite .",
    "recent cosmological n - body simulations within cdm @xcite and wdm models @xcite have shown that dark matter is not distributed in space homogeneously , instead it forms more or less compact structures surrounded by less dense continuously distributed dm .",
    "the most massive structures have been recognized for quite a long time already : these are galactic and galaxy cluster dm haloes . but numerical simulations demonstrate that these massive structures are also inhomogeneous : they contain smaller compact substructures over a wide range of masses .",
    "such massive haloes containing a hierarchical substructure of dark matter are called host haloes .",
    "these haloes also contain smaller substructures , etc .",
    "however , one should note that only the existence of the more massive members of this hierarchy of dm structures has been proven from the results of observations .",
    "the lower estimated limit on the substructure masses depends on the particular kind of considered hypothetical dm particles , varying over a very wide range from @xmath7 for cdm up to @xmath8 for wdm @xcite . to clear out the situation and the terminology used to characterize masses and scales of dm substructures , we have summarized here in table [ table0 ] the used nomenclature .",
    ".dark matter hierarchy within the cdm / sidm cosmologies . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table0 ]    dm substructure depends very significantly on the cosmological model . within cdm models ,",
    "the substructure formation process can be described as `` bottom - up '' : the smallest dm clumps were formed first ( therefore the nanohaloes with masses @xmath9 are often referred as primordial ) and do not contain any finer substructure @xcite . then",
    ", in the merging process more and more massive structures up to galactic and cluster scales ( 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 were gradually formed . due to various damping scales",
    "the lower limits on substructure mass can vary over a wide range : from 10@xmath13 - 10@xmath14 m@xmath3 for various kinds of wimps ( including neutralinos ) , down to 10@xmath15 - 10@xmath16 m@xmath3 for axions . the mass density distribution in dm structures within the cdm model is often assumed to follow the cusped nfw profile of @xcite .",
    "the best accepted alternative to the cdm cosmology is the velocity - dependent sidm ( self - interacting - dark - matter ) .",
    "this model predicts identical behavior of the dm substructure over various scales and identical mass fractions , thus , the only difference lies in the density profile of a dm clump .",
    "the sidm clump has a core and its density follows a burkert profile @xcite , or pseudo - isothermal sphere @xcite , contrarily to the cuspy coreless nfw profile typical for cdm clumps .",
    "the set of warm dark matter models differs completely from the two mentioned above when we keep in mind gravitational microlensing processes .",
    "the substructure formation in wdm models is a complex hybrid ; its leading role is played by the `` top - down '' formation process @xcite , i.e. bigger haloes and filaments were formed first , and smaller structures formed later , as a result of fragmentation processes in wdm filaments @xcite .",
    "the lower limit on the subhalo mass is significantly higher than in cdm / sidm ones : e.g. , @xmath17 @xmath18 for gravitinos and even @xmath19 for axinos @xcite .",
    "thus in the wdm cosmology , we may predict the non existence of dm gravitational microlensing .",
    "even despite that it was recently shown @xcite that the wdm structure formation rather follows the hybrid scenario than the `` top - down '' one , the effects of fragmentation and collapse play a significant role only in massive haloes formation , and thus the situation with dark matter induced gravitational microlensing in wdm cosmology is not significantly altered .",
    "the dm subhalo mass function ( shmf ) @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 represents the space number of substructures with a mass in the range @xmath22 in the host dm halo with a mass @xmath23 is strongly sensitive to the dm context ( i.e. warm , cold , collisionless , repulsive and so on ) .",
    "the shmf appears to provide the essential source of crucial information both in cosmology and elementary particle physics .",
    "the numerical simulations like `` millenium '' @xcite or `` via lactea '' @xcite allow us to determine it only at higher subhalo masses ( mainly @xmath24 than typical microlens masses ( i.e. not greater than @xmath25 .",
    "however for lower masses of the substructure we can use here the extrapolated mass function obtained by @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the total mass in substructures within the cdm model ( with a lower limit of @xmath29 @xmath30 is 52% , following @xcite .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the 50% of dark matter in the galactic halo in substructures obtained from the hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite . using this formula",
    ", one can easily find that for the lower limit of @xmath31 ( which can be considered as a reasonable limit for microlens mass ) it is 43% , and for @xmath32 ( let us consider this value as an upper limit on microlens mass ) it is 30% .",
    "thus within the desirable range @xmath33 of the substructures we have 13% of the total dm mass ( i.e. @xmath34 is in compact stellar - mass subhaloes ) . if we take into account the fact that the larger subhaloes ( with mass greater than @xmath35 ) also contain finer substructures , this value can be even larger .",
    "however , estimating the probability of the dm subhalo microlensing we should take into account that up to 90% of the primordial subhaloes had to be fully or partially disrupted by tidal forces of stars , thus the percentage of the clumped matter in the areas containing stars can not exceed 10% @xcite .",
    "thus we can expect to trace the dm - induced high amplification microlensing events in the galactic dm halo ( as well as in extragalactic systems ) rather than in its luminous parts .",
    "the probability of the galaxy stars being microlensed by a dm microhalo is much lower then .",
    "that is why we can hardly expect to find compact dm clumps in the vicinity of the solar system .",
    "however , at the same time , in the luminous parts of a galaxy we can face the situation when a star ( or a star - mass black hole ) is surrounded by a dense cloud , formed by dark matter of a former clump , disrupted by star / black hole tidal force and trapped by its gravity . if such a clump is dense enough and thus has an optical depth large enough ( overcritical convergence ) , we can observe the ucmh @xcite , and one of the possible results of gravitational microlensing by such an object looks like an eclipse of the source image .",
    "the role of optical depth / convergence in microlensing processes was analyzed by @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "such an object can be modeled up by a schwarzschild or chang - refsdal lens with overcritical convergence .",
    "speaking about the milky way systems , we confine ourselves to the simplest cases of circular symmetric mass distributions though investigations of double stars or planetary systems are also important .",
    "one can get some insight into the latter case from considerations of clump models with an external shear @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we use the lens equation in its normalized form ; the distances will be expressed in units of a typical length scale @xmath36 , where for the case of the point mass @xmath37 or cored clump microlens @xmath38 ( in case of a point mass this is the radius of the einstein ring ) and for the cusped clump @xmath39 $ ] ; here @xmath40 is the distance between the source and the observer , @xmath41 the distance between the deflector and the observer , and @xmath42 the distance between the source and the deflector .",
    "furthermore @xmath43 is the normalized angular source position , @xmath44 is the normalized angular image position , @xmath45 .",
    "we remind here that ( after normalization ) both these vectors are defined in the lens plane .    the normalized lens equation is : @xmath46 where the deflection angle @xmath47 is supposed to be normalized to a corresponding length scale",
    ", @xmath48 stands for a convergence ( optical depth ) that can be due to , e.g. , a background dm ; @xmath49 .",
    "let us write @xmath50 , where for the cusped clump we assume @xmath51 to provide the convergence in the integral of eq.([phi ] ) , and for the point microlens @xmath52 .",
    "for the cored clump we use a generalized expression @xmath53 that formally covers the previous cases if we put @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we consider the lens equation    @xmath55    the determinant of the lens mapping ( [ eq1z ] ) is @xmath56 .",
    "it factorizes as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 the image parity is defined by the sign of @xmath59 .",

    "therefore , we see that at least some extended microlens models can be , in principle , either confirmed or rejected from the use of high - quality observations .",
    "however , in real observations of microlensing by galactic objects , the situation will be aggravated by the possible presence of unobservable planets and star companions .",
    "then in this case a more detailed treatment of concrete high amplification events is also necessary to compare the models that involve binaries and planets with those dealing with extended clumps .    in extragalactic glss",

    "nevertheless , individual light curves in case ( i1 ) can also include high amplification and de - amplification effects which have an analogous look as in case ( i2 ) .",
    "the other complication in extragalactic glss is that owing to the non - negligible source size since both the light curves and the centroid brightness trajectory will be smoothed out significantly .",
    "to have an idea about microlensing in cases ( i1 ) and ( i2 ) , we considered statistical models of many - body microlensing systems that involve both point and extended microlenses .",
    "the latter have been represented by a special case of the cored clumps .",
    "considerations of section [ statistical ] have much in common with considerations by @xcite that , among other questions , deal with the issue of microlensing by extended structures .",
    "in particular , @xcite pay attention to microlensing brightness variations in presence of a variable smooth matter depending on the parity of the close macrolens images .",
    "these papers , however , are mainly aimed at investigating the problem of anomalous flux ratios and therefore they deal with other mass and spatial scales .",
    "our simulations deal with extended microlenses ( e.g. , dm clumps ) of stellar mass , with sizes comparable to that of corresponding einstein rings  in order to have a noticeable effect in the light curves .",
    "a technical difference of our simulations owes to the simplified model of the lens mapping in presence of the clumps , which enables us to speed up the numerical calculations of acfs with a rather modest computer hardware . for every choice of parameters that characterize the content of the clumps , their sizes and masses",

    "joint use of microlensed flux variations and acfs may provide a means for determining the clump fraction and the other parameters of the lensing system .",
    "indeed , there is a notable difference between the acfs for different values of the clump contribution . in this view",
    ", we note the remark by @xcite that the microlensing variations appear to be `` less dramatic for extended subhalos than for point microlenses '' .",
    "this also has been mostly observed in our simulations , though with some exceptions .",

    "the density of dm in the universe is five times higher than the baryonic one and the percentage of the luminous matter in galaxies is even lower by one order .",
