    "the detection of a gravitational wave ( gw ) signal by the advanced ligo detectors has enabled the use of gws as a new observational method for astrophysics @xcite .",
    "an upgrade over the next several years will increase the sensitivity of advanced ligo ( figure  [ fig : intro ] ) , and new detectors , kagra @xcite and advanced virgo @xcite , will soon be installed .",
    "thus , a large amount of observational data on gws , which are not only signals from individual events but also the background from unresolved events @xcite , will be available in the near future . in any case , we will be able to access unique information on source objects such as black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "statistical studies on their binary merger rate will also be possible @xcite when the number of detected merger signals increases .",
    "up to now , two signals ( gw150914 and gw151226 ) and one candidate ( lvt151012 ) have been reported from the first observational run of the advanced ligo detectors @xcite .",
    "the first detection of a gw , gw150914 , was a merger of two bhs with masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is interesting because the astrophysical origin of bhs with @xmath230@xmath3 , particularly their binaries , is not trivial . since massive stars with solar abundance ( metallicity of @xmath4 )",
    "lose a large amount of their mass in the late stage of their evolution , it is difficult for them to form such heavy bhs .",
    "in contrast , the mass loss is not efficient for stars with low metallicities .",
    "if the mass of the iron core is too high at the end of their life , the stellar core collapse would result in the failure of explosion and the progenitors would completely collapse to a bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the bh binaries found as gw150914 are expected to have been formed in a low - metallicity environment @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above condition , we should consider the formation and evolution process of binary systems of heavy bhs .",
    "it is thought that two formation channels are possible @xcite .",
    "the first possibility is from isolated binaries of massive stars @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "both of the massive stars would result in bh formation while their evolution process would be different from that of single stars .",
    "they would experience highly non - conservative mass transfer , common envelope ejection or chemically homogeneous evolution due to strong internal mixing .",
    "the second possibility is through dynamical interactions in a dense stellar cluster @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the binary bh can be formed by a three - body encounter of a single bh with a binary containing another bh .",
    "the precise value of the critical metallicity for the formation of heavy bhs is also an uncertain factor .",
    "bh formation may be possible in sub - solar metallicity of @xmath5 or @xmath6 @xcite , or may require metal - free ( population iii ) stars @xcite",
    ". in any case , the cosmological evolution of metallicity plays a key role in estimating the event rate of binary bh mergers .    in this study , we investigate the cosmological evolution of the binary bh merger rate based on the star formation history of low - metallicity stars .",

    "* ) , as well as the star formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we also examine the model adopted in @xcite . in   [ sec : mrgwbg ] , we present the formulation of the binary bh merger rate .",
    "we also investigate the gw background from binary bh mergers and derive the relation between the merger rate at the local universe and the energy density of the gw background .",

    "heavy bhs with mass @xmath230@xmath3 are expected to be formed in a low - metallicity environment below a critical metallicity , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the bh formation rate should be proportional to the cosmic star formation rate density ( csfrd ) of low - metallicity stars .",
    "we investigate the dependence on @xmath8 considering the csfrd of stars with metallicity below @xmath8 , as done in @xcite .",

    "the sfr is higher for galaxies with higher stellar mass , while the specific sfr , @xmath27 , is higher for galaxies with lower stellar mass .",

    "the galaxy mass - metallicity relation was expressed as @xmath32 where we adopt the best fit values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at different redshifts from case _ a _ in table  5 of @xcite .",
    "this relation is applicable for stellar masses of @xmath35 , which correspond to @xmath36 at @xmath37 and @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",

    "we show the total csfrd and csfrd of low - metallicity stars in figure  [ fig : csfrd ] . the resultant total csfrd is lower than that in @xcite , which has often been cited .",

    "incidentally , in the redshift range of @xmath44 , the difference from the recent model of @xcite is not large ; our csfrd model is 1030% higher .",
    "the total csfrd has a peak near the redshift @xmath45 , or equivalently the lookback time of 11  gyr , and declines towards the present epoch . in figure",
    "[ fig : csfrd ] , we also show the fraction of stars formed with metallicity below @xmath8 , @xmath46 , as a function of the lookback time . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the fraction has not varied much over the last 8  gyr ( i.e. , redshift @xmath48 ) , while the total csfrd is decreasing .",
    "this trend originates from the models of galaxy evolution adopted in this study .",
    "firstly , the stellar mass function of @xcite does not evolve significantly in this period .",
    "secondly , when the sfr is drawn as a function of the stellar mass , the slope in the low - mass range does not depend on the redshift , and the peak mass , @xmath28 , becomes higher at a high redshift ( see the top panel of figure  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite , the galaxy mass - metallicity relation moves toward higher masses but its shape is preserved at a high redshift , which is also described in @xcite . as a result , these two shifts balance out and the fraction of stars formed in a low - metallicity environment is almost constant for @xmath48 .",
    "here , we construct the alternative model for the csfrd of low - metallicity stars following @xcite , which was also adopted in @xcite . it is based on the mean metallicity at the redshift @xmath7 , which is written as @xmath49 with cosmological constants @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",

    ", we emphasize that equation  ( [ eq : solmet ] ) gives the mean metallicity of the universe and does not purely reflect the metallicity of star - forming regions .",
    "since short - lived massive stars are responsible for the formation of bhs and nss , our standard model , in which the csfrd of low - metallicity stars is considered with the stellar mass function and sfr of galaxies , is more reasonable for the purpose of this study .",
    "in this section , we investigate the merger rate of binary bhs formed in a low - metallicity environment . the merger rate is calculated as a function of redshift utilizing the models of metallicity evolution in   [ sec : csfrd ] . for this purpose ,",

    "in other words , we focus on the physics free from these uncertainties .    in figure  [",

    "they are shown as a ratio to the values at the local universe ( @xmath54 ) to be independent of the conversion coefficient @xmath73 , which is not evaluated .",
    "we can see that the evolution of the merger rate depends on the minimum delay time @xmath69 ; the rise time of the merger rate becomes later and the ratio of the peak to local merger rates decreases for the models with a longer delay time . on the other hand ,",
    "the scaled merger rate is insensitive to the critical metallicity , especially for @xmath47 .",
    "this is because , for redshift @xmath48 , the fraction of stars formed below @xmath8 is almost time independent , and hence the evolution of the scaled formation rate of low - metallicity stars is insensitive to @xmath8 .",

    "in particular , for a case with a lower critical metallicity , binary bhs are formed mainly at a high redshift and the evolution of the merger rate follows the delay time distribution .",

    "<S> the cosmological evolution of the binary black hole ( bh ) merger rate and the energy density of the gravitational - wave ( gw ) background are investigated . to evaluate the redshift dependence of the bh formation rate , bhs </S>",
    "<S> are assumed to originate from low - metallicity stars , and the relations between the star formation rate , metallicity and stellar mass of galaxies are combined with the stellar mass function at each redshift . as a result , it is found that when the energy density of the gw background is scaled with the merger rate at the local universe , the scaling factor does not depend on the critical metallicity for the formation of bhs . also taking into account the merger of binary neutron stars , a simple formula to express the energy spectrum of the gw background is constructed for the inspiral phase . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the local merger rate and the energy density of the gw background will be examined by future gw observations . </S>"
