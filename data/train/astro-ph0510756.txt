    "characterized by their faint luminosities ( m@xmath11 ) and low effective surface brightnesses ( @xmath12 ) , dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are numerically the dominant galaxy type in galaxy clusters ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ) .",
    "de galaxies are often subdivided into those with nuclei ( de , n ) and those without ( de , non ) , a division with a broad luminosity dependence in the sense that most des brighter than m@xmath13 have nuclei , while those fainter than m@xmath14 do not ( sandage , binggeli & tamman 1985 ) .",
    "recently it has come to light that a further division may be made ; one of rotating and non - rotating des ( de rijcke et al .  2001 ; pedraz et al .",

    "formation scenarios for des must satisfy the observational constraints that ( conselice 2004 ) : _",
    "( i ) _ des preferentially exist in dense regions ( even though they are spatially diffuse ) , _ ( ii ) _ des exhibit both rotational and pressure support , and _ ( iii ) _ des contain old , metal - poor stars and/or young , metal - rich stars .",
    "the presently favored models of de formation may be roughly distilled as follows : des are primordial objects which formed early on in dense environments ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 ) and possibly `` squelched '' by reionisation ( tully et al .",
    "2002 ) , or that des are objects which had a progenitor population ( spiral or irregular galaxies ) and were morphologically transformed in the cluster environment ( mao & mo 1998 ; moore et al .  1998 ; mastropietro et al .",
    "observations of the velocity and spatial distributions of des in galaxy clusters suggest that they may have infallen quite recently ( conselice et al .",
    "this combined with the fact that the stellar populations of des differ from field dwarfs ( van zee et al .",
    "2004a ) , and occasionally show spiral structures and ( e.g. , jerjen et al .",
    "2000 ; barazza et al .",
    "2002 ; graham et al .  2003 ; de rijcke et al .  2003 ) supports the notion that at least some des were morphologically transformed from late - type galaxies .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) provide a different perspective with which to investigate de galaxy formation .",
    "gcs are among the oldest observable stellar populations .",
    "their high binding energies makes them relatively robust against tidal disruption , and their luminous , compact nature allows for easy separation from the galaxy background . these and other factors make them ideal tracers of the mass aggregation history of galaxies ( e.g. , west et al .",

    "a color range of @xmath35 was adopted for gcs , which encompasses age and metallicity combinations of 1 gyr , [ m / h]=2.25 to 15 gyr , [ m / h]=0.67 ( maraston 1998 ) .",
    "objects with @xmath36 and @xmath37 were deemed too luminous to be true gcs .",
    "these bright limits are roughly two magnitudes brighter than the most luminous milky way gc ( @xmath38 cen ) at the distance of vcc  1087 .",
    "sizes for the gc candidates were measured using ishape ( larsen 1999 ) , and this information was used to expunge objects outside the range of half - light radius ( @xmath39 ) expected for milky way gcs ( @xmath40 ) .",

    "indeed , from our spectroscopy ( see section  [ spectroscopy ] ) , all the gcs identified on the _ hst_/acs images were found to be _ bona fide _ clusters ( the faintest being @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the contamination rate for cluster candidates brighter than this ( approximately the turn - over ( to ) in the gclf ) is consistent with zero . to quantify the contamination from background galaxies at magnitudes fainter than @xmath43 , a master background file was constructed from the acs / virgo survey dwarf galaxy fields at large radii as discussed in strader et al .",

    "this effective wavelength range varied slightly between objects due to the varying slitlet positions on the slitmask . on the red side , a 831 lines / mm grating was used , blazed at 8200  to cover the ca ii triplet region .",

    "the zeropoints of the wavelength calibration were checked against skylines in the background spectra , and were in some cases adjusted by a few tenths of an angstrom .",
    "these wavelength solutions were further adjusted as described below .",
    "the spectra were then combined with cosmic - ray rejection , and flux calibrated using the response function derived from our flux standard .",
    "error spectra were extracted in parallel with the object spectra to facilitate accurate estimation of uncertainties in our analysis .    the velocity dispersion of the vcc  1087 gc system was anticipated to be similar to that of the galaxy itself at @xmath48 km s@xmath49 ( geha et al .",
    "this required that particular care was taken to characterize the uncertainties in our radial velocity measurements in this study .",
    "the theoretical velocity accuracy for our spectral resolution is @xmath50 km s@xmath49 at 4500 .",
    "radial velocities for the gcs were derived using the movel algorithm described in gonzlez  ( 1993 ) .",
    "this is an improvement over the classic fourier quotient method ( sargent et al .  1977 ) which determines radial velocities and velocity dispersions simultaneously .",
    "although our spectral resolution did not allow to us measure velocity dispersions for the gcs themselves , we used this approach since experimentation showed that it provides more robust velocity determinations than classical cross - correlation procedures .",
    "as reference template spectra for this method , we employed a number of lick stars observed during the run . to prevent overestimating the uncertainties in the method , which can appear when velocity dispersion solutions are close to zero , the gc spectra were broadened by convolving them with a gaussian of @xmath51 km s@xmath49 .",
    "uncertainties in the radial velocities were computed from 100 montecarlo simulations using the error spectra .    after measuring velocities ,",
    "small deviations from the linear wavelength scale were corrected by using the miles spectral energy distributions ( vazdekis et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) as rest - frame wavelength calibrators .",
    "each gc spectrum was cross - correlated with an appropriate miles template in @xmath23100 small , overlapping spectral regions in the dispersion direction .",
    "the derived offsets ( around zero but not necessarily null ) were fitted as a function of wavelength , thus providing a low - order , polynomial correction to the prior wavelength calibration that was applied to the deredshifted data . in this way",
    ", all the final gc spectra resulted in having an homogeneous , rest - frame , linear wavelength scale .",
    "these velocities are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , the mean velocity uncertainty is 22 km s@xmath49 , in good agreement with the expected value .",
    "example spectra are shown in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "lick indices were measured from the spectra using the definitions given in trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "index uncertainties were determined from the error spectra .",
    "small additive offsets where applied to the measured indices obtained from our lick standard star observations , and were in general smaller than the index uncertainties .",
    "the spatial distribution of the gc candidates on the @xmath29 image is shown in figure  [ finder ] .",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed gcs are also indicated ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the gcs are concentrated towards the center of the galaxy , and appear spatially elongated in the ne  sw sense .",

    "this is in agreement with the _ hst _ studies of de propris et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and lotz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but is in the opposite sense to the conclusions of ground - based work ( e.g. , rakos & schombert 2004 ; caldwell & bothun 1987 ) .",
    "presumably this disagreement stems from the fact that the ground - based work failed to resolve the de nuclei .    the color - magnitude distribution for the confirmed and candidate gcs is shown in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "the gcs show a blue peak ( metal - poor clusters , henceforth mpcs ) , and a possible tail of red ( metal - rich clusters , henceforth mrcs ) gcs .",
    "a straight mean of the color distribution gives @xmath58 with a dispersion of 0.22 mag .",
    "peak locations for the mpcs and ( putative ) mrcs were determined using the bayesian code nmix ( richardson & green 1997 ) , which implements mixture modeling of heteroscedastic normal distributions with the number of subpopulations a free parameter . for vcc  1087 , the posterior distribution of this parameter peaked at two , suggesting two groups in the color distribution with peaks at @xmath59 and 1.17 for the mpcs and mrcs respectively .",
    "the red objects ( @xmath60 ) near to our 50% completeness limit are possibly background galaxies ( this statement can only be confirmed spectroscopically ) . to check",
    "whether these objects are driving this bimodal signature , we cut the cmd at @xmath61 and re - ran the code .",
    "again , two populations were preferred with peaks at @xmath59 and 1.16 .",
    "similarly , a kmm test ( ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) returned two peaks at @xmath62 and 1.16 , although with a fairly low significance ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "these peak positions are consistent with the galaxy luminosity gc color relations derived by strader et al .",
    "we tentatively identify the objects with @xmath64 and @xmath65 as mrcs , three of which , confirmed by our spectroscopy , are consistent with this interpretation ( e.g. , figure  [ mh ] ) .",
    "note that , in the subsequent analysis , we have not separated out the blue and red subpopulations due to the small number of clusters .",
    "the radial density profile of the gc system is compared to the galaxy surface brightness profile in figure  [ profile ] .",
    "we fitted the gc profile with the functional form @xmath66 . excluding the innermost bin ( see below ) , we find @xmath67 , where the uncertainty comes from a bootstrap of the density profile .",
    "a power - law index of @xmath67 is relatively shallow , more characteristic of the gc systems of cd galaxies than those of low - luminosity ellipticals ( e.g. , harris et al .",
    "similarly shallow density profiles have been suggested for the gc systems of des previously ( durrell et al 1996a ; lotz et al .",
    "the galaxy starlight is well fit by a s@xmath68rsic ( 1968 ) profile with @xmath69 ( geha et al .",
    "2003 ) , where @xmath70 corresponds to an exponential profile , and @xmath71 corresponds to an @xmath72 law .",
    "there is the suggestion of a `` core '' in the gc density profile near the galaxy effective radius , where there is a deficit of clusters compared to the power - law slope .",
    "lotz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discussed the existence of such cores in the context of the formation of de nuclei through the dynamical destruction of gcs at small radii .",
    "could these `` missing '' gcs be the cause of the break in the density profile ? for gcs at the turn - over of the gclf ( see below ) , @xmath73 , i.e. , 40 typical gcs would need to coalesce to give the observed nuclear luminosity .",
    "these additional gcs ( added to the innermost radial bin ) are indicated by the open square in figure  [ profile ] ( for simplicity , we assume that these `` missing '' gcs occupied the same radial distribution as those present in the inner bin . ) the position of these gcs lie on an extrapolation of the power - law fit in figure  [ profile ] .",
    "this would seem to suggest that the existence of a core may indicate dynamical destruction processes .",
    "however , since the timescale for dynamical friction is expected to scale as @xmath74 , one would expect that the most massive gcs decay first ( for a given spatial density profile ) .",
    "drawing clusters from the bright end of the observed gclf ( figure  [ lf ] ) , @xmath44 gcs are required to equal the luminosity of the galaxy nucleus ( the number of luminous gcs required is clearly dependent upon the exact shape of the `` zero - age '' luminosity function , but presumably the bright end has not become brighter with time ) .",
    "this is indicated by the open circle in figure  [ profile ] , whose position is @xmath75 away from the extrapolated profile fit . from these very simplistic arguments ,",
    "unless somehow turn - over mass clusters are preferentially disrupted , the luminosity of the nucleus and the core in the inner parts of gc surface density of vcc  1087 can not both be explained purely due to the action of dynamical friction .",
    "the luminosity functions for the vcc  1087 gcs in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 bands are shown in figure  [ lf ] .",
    "the 50% completeness limits of the photometry suggest that we detect gcs down to the faint limit of the gclf .",
    "we fitted both gaussian and t@xmath76 functions to the unbinned magnitude data using a slightly modified version of the maximum - likelihood code of secker & harris ( 1993 ) . within the uncertainties of the fits , both functions yield indistinguishable means and dispersions ( assuming @xmath77 ) , and we give the more familiar gaussian best - fit parameters . leaving the gaussian means and dispersions as free parameters in the fit , we obtain @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "these fits are shown in figure  [ lf ] .",
    "inspection of the figure suggests that the dispersions of the gclf , particularly in the case of @xmath29 , may be overestimated .",
    "experimentation with the secker & harris ( 1993 ) code suggested that for small @xmath82 , @xmath83 can become artificially large .",
    "the straight standard deviations of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 gclfs ( not accounting for incompleteness ) are 1.1 and 1.0 respectively , and we fixed these in the code to assess the impact on the derived gclf peak positions .",
    "@xmath84 becomes 0.06 mag brighter , while @xmath85 becomes 0.15 mag brighter . both these shifts are within the uncertainties , and therefore we adopt the original maximum - likelihood parameters .    at our adopted distance",
    "to vcc  1087 , the apparent turnover magnitudes we derive correspond to absolute magnitudes of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these turn - over magnitudes are consistent with that found by strader et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who constructed a gclf from 37 individual virgo des .",
    "these authors found @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in which our photometry for vcc  1087 was included .",
    "interestingly , from the mean gclf turnover magnitudes of three giant virgo ellipticals ( ngc  4486 , ngc  4472 & ngc  4649 ) , strader et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found @xmath88 and @xmath89 , i.e. , the virgo des ( including vcc  1087 ) have turnover - magnitudes consistent with luminous virgo ellipticals .",
    "this consistency , particularly in @xmath30 for which color differences in the systems are expected to have little effect on the gclf peak positions , seems to suggest that either dynamical destruction of gcs in des and luminous es operates very similarly , or that it is not a dominant process in shaping the mass function of gc systems .",
    "dynamical friction ( chandrasekhar 1943 ) and disk / bulge shocking ( fall & rees 1977 ) are expected to operate on the high- and low - mass ends of the gc mass function respectively .",
    "these dynamical destruction processes are expected to be functions of the dynamical structure and gravitational potential of the host galaxy ( for a given gc mass function and spatial distribution ) , which makes it unlikely that dwarf and giant galaxies will destroy their gcs similarly .",
    "processes which may act against dynamical friction are discussed in lotz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and include high dark matter halo densities and/or larger halo core radii with respect to the baryons , and kinetic heating mechanisms such as that which may come from gc scattering from black holes or through tidal stirring .",
    "the affects of disk / bulge shocking could be ameliorated by placing the gcs on primarily tangential orbits , thereby avoiding the galaxy centers .",
    "these possibilities would be a fruitful area of exploration through numerical simulation .",
    "we obtain a biweight location ( beers et al .",
    "1990 ) velocity for the gc system of @xmath90 km s@xmath49 .",
    "this compares well with the canonical ned value ( simien & prugniel 2002 ) of @xmath91 km s@xmath49 , and with the velocity derived from our integrated spectrum of the galaxy ( @xmath92 km s@xmath49 ) .",
    "we have looked for rotation in the gc system by performing linear weighted fits to the gc velocities as a function of position angle .",
    "the gcs show a maximal rotation signature about p.a.=127@xmath93 , with @xmath94 km s@xmath49 arcmin@xmath49 . over the radial extent of these data",
    "( i.e. , measured from the center of the galaxy to the outermost gc ) this corresponds to v@xmath95 km s@xmath49 , assuming solid - body rotation .",
    "the linear fit to the gc velocities about p.a.@xmath96 is shown in figure  [ rotation ] . the p.a .",
    "of the rotation axis of the gcs appears to be close to _ parallel _ to the p.a . of the galaxy isophotes ( @xmath97 ) and the p.a . of the gcs ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this alignment of the rotation axis is in a similar sense to that found by puzia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the gc system of the de ngc  3115 dw1 .",
    "the gcs in vcc  1087 appear to rotate _ along _ an axis of @xmath98 , which is close to the minor axis p.a .",
    "of vcc  1087 s isophotes ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the biweight scale of the velocities ( velocity dispersion , @xmath100 ) of the vcc  1087 gcs is @xmath101 km s@xmath49 . to obtain a `` true''velocity dispersion for the gcs ( denoted @xmath102 ) we corrected for our intrinsic velocity uncertainties ( subtracting in quadrature ) and for rotation in the gc system .",
    "this yields @xmath103 km s@xmath49 at a mean galactocentric radius of 35 arcsec ( @xmath10 kpc ) .",
    "similar to such considerations for elliptical galaxies , one may ask whether the rotation in the gc system is dynamically significant by considering an isotropic oblate rotator with ellipticity @xmath104 ( e.g. , binney 1978 ) :    @xmath105^{1/2}}\\ ] ]    for a system with @xmath106 ( approximately the ellipticity of both the galaxy the gc system ) , @xmath107 . for the vcc  1087 gcs",
    "we find : @xmath108 , giving @xmath109 .",
    "this result is suggestive that the gc system is supported by rotation .",
    "we have investigated where the vcc  1087 gc system lies with respect to other gc systems in the ellipticity@xmath110 plane .",
    "there is surprisingly little information on the azimuthal distributions gc systems in the literature , precluding an accurate knowledge of @xmath104 .",
    "we have assumed that the ellipticity of the host galaxy reflects that of the gc system ( and , where they have been separated , that of the both the mpc and mrc subpopulations ) .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the globular cluster ( gc ) system of the nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy vcc  1087 in the virgo cluster , based on keck / lris spectroscopy and archival _ hubble space telescope_/advanced camera for surveys imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate vcc  1087 hosts a total population of @xmath0 gcs , which corresponds to a relatively high @xmath1-band specific frequency of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 color distribution of the gcs shows a blue ( metal - poor ) peak with a tail of redder ( metal - rich ) clusters similar in color to those seen in luminous ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function of the gcs is log - normal and peaks at @xmath4 , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these peak positions are consistent with those found for luminous virgo ellipticals , suggesting either the lack of , or surprisingly similar , dynamical destruction processes of gcs among dwarf and giant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy of a subsample of 12 gcs suggests that the gc system is old and coeval ( @xmath610 gyr ) , with a fairly broad metallicity distribution ( 1.8@xmath7[m / h]@xmath70.8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , an integrated spectrum of the underlying galaxy starlight reveals that its optical luminosity is dominated by metal - rich , intermediate - aged stars . </S>",
    "<S> radial velocities of the gcs suggest rotation close to the major axis of the galaxy , and this rotation is dynamically significant with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> a compilation of the kinematics of the gc systems of 9 early - type galaxies shows surprising diversity in the @xmath9 parameter for gc systems . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the gc system of vcc  1087 exhibits the most significant rotation to velocity dispersion signature . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical mass modeling of the velocity dispersion profile of the gcs and galaxy stars suggest fairly constant mass - to - light ratios of @xmath10 out to 6.5 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the present observations can entertain both baryonic and non - baryonic solutions , and gc velocities at larger radii would be most valuable with regard to this issue . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the evolution of vcc  1087 in terms of the galaxy `` harassment '' scenario , and conclude that this galaxy may well be the remains of a faded , tidally perturbed sc spiral . </S>"
