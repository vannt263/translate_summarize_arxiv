    "massive stars with masses @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the mass of the sun ) end their lives in the most spectacular and violent events in the universe : explosions called supernovae , which are driven by gravitational collapse of the stellar core ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the mechanism for",
    "the collapse - driven supernova explosion has been a central mystery in astrophysics for almost half a century @xcite .",
    "great efforts have been made to unravel the mystery and a qualitative picture has been obtained so far ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "we now know that after supernova explosions the collapsing core becomes a dense compact object , neutron star , for @xmath2 or further collapses to a black hole for @xmath3 . however , no calculations incorporating reasonable physical input succeeded in reproducing an explosion ; in the calculations , shock waves stall on their way out of the collapsing core and the core does not explode but contracts into a black hole .",
    "these earlier studies suggest that interactions between neutrinos from the central region of the star and the shocked matter are important for the success of an explosion .",
    "this will hopefully revive the shock wave , and lead to a successful explosion .    in equilibrium dense matter in supernova cores and neutron stars , the existence of nuclei with rod - like and slab - like shape",
    "is predicted @xcite .",
    "such nuclei with exotic shapes are referred to as nuclear `` pasta . ''",
    "the nuclear pasta itself is an interesting subject from the point of view of materials science of dense stellar matter and it has been studied by nuclear physicists in addition to astrophysicists for more than twenty years .",
    "furthermore , the pasta phases have recently begun to attract the attention of many researchers ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . as has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and elaborated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the existence of the pasta phases modifies the interaction between neutrinos and matter significantly .",
    "our recent work @xcite strongly suggests the possibility of dynamical formation of the pasta phases in collapsing cores from a crystalline lattice of spherical nuclei ; effects of the pasta phases on the supernova explosions should be seriously discussed in the near future .    in the present article",
    ", we provide an overview of the physics and astrophysical background of the pasta phases for researchers in other fields , especially in soft condensed matter physics .",
    "we try to show that the pasta phases can be an interesting system for many researchers in various fields , not only for nuclear astrophysicists .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the remaining part of the present section",
    ", we first give a brief explanation of collapse - driven supernovae , neutron stars and materials in these objects .",
    "we then describe the basic physics and astrophysical consequences of the pasta phases . in section [ sect_soft ]",
    ", we discuss the similarity between the pasta phases and soft condensed matter .",
    "we then explain a theoretical framework used in our studies in section [ sect_md_nucleon ] , and show the results in section [ sect_result ] . in this article",
    ", we generally set the boltzmann constant @xmath4 .",
    "stars evolve by burning light elements into heavier ones ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; here burning means nuclear fusion .",
    "the ultimate fate of the star is basically determined by its mass in the main sequence period , when the star is supported by thermal pressure of burning hydrogen nuclei ( protons ) .",
    "nuclear reactions of heavier nuclei require higher temperatures because of their greater coulomb barrier .",
    "in the core of massive stars with @xmath5 , the temperature reaches a threshold to produce iron .",
    "elements heavier than iron can not be produced by nuclear fusion since the binding energy per nucleon of iron is the greatest among all the elements .",
    "therefore iron nuclei , the major final product of a chain of the thermally driven nuclear reactions , accumulate in the core of massive stars at the end of their evolution .    as the nuclear burning proceeds and the mass of the iron core increases , two processes which tend to make the core unstable to collapse occur  electron capture , and photodissociation of heavy nuclei . in the iron core",
    "the density is so high ( @xmath6 ) that the core is supported mainly by electron degeneracy pressure ; degenerate electrons have extremely large momenta even at zero temperature due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "when the electron fermi energy exceeds 3.7 mev , electron capture on iron nuclei occurs : @xmath7    since this reaction decreases the electron density , the electron degeneracy pressure decreases and can no longer support the iron core .",
    "this instability leads to contraction of the core .",
    "the other instability is triggered by photodissociation of iron nuclei , which occurs when the temperature of the core is @xmath8 k : @xmath9 this is an endothermic reaction ; thus it decreases the gas pressure and accelerates the collapse .    as the collapse of the core proceeds and the central density approaches the nuclear saturation density ( normal nuclear density ) , @xmath10 @xmath11 , the equation of state suddenly becomes hard because of a strong short - range repulsion between nucleons . due to this hardening",
    ", the pressure becomes sufficiently high to halt the collapse , causing the inner region of the core to bounce .",
    "the outer region of the core continues to fall towards the center at supersonic velocities .",
    "consequently , the bouncing inner core drives a shock wave into the infalling outer core .",
    "the initial energy of the shock is @xmath12 erg and is enough to blow off the stellar envelope , which results in an explosion of the star .",
    "however , the shock wave propagating through the outer core is weakened by several processes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which decrease the pressure and dissipate the energy behind the shock front . consequently ,",
    "the shock wave stalls in the outer core .",
    "neutrinos emitted from the inner core will heat the matter behind the shock front ( a process referred to as neutrino heating ) .",
    "if the neutrino heating is efficient enough , the stalled shock can be revived , reach the surface of the outer core , propagate beyond the core , and finally blow off the outer layer of the star ; thereby producing a supernova explosion .",
    "the contracted core remains as a nascent neutron star .",
    "the difference in the gravitational energy between the iron core and a neutron star is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , @xmath15 is the mass of the core , @xmath16 km is the initial radius of the iron core and the neutron star radius @xmath17 is about 10 km",
    ". only one percent of this energy is injected into the gas blown off and 99 % is carried away by neutrinos . in the supernova explosion , neutrinos interact with matter and will inject kinetic energy into it .",
    "therefore detailed investigations of interactions between neutrinos and matter in supernova cores are necessary to understand the explosion mechanism ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    as the density in the core increases during the collapse , the mean free path of neutrinos @xmath18 decreases mainly due to the neutrino coherent scattering from nuclei via the weak neutral current .",
    "the amplitude of the coherent scattering is proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the mass number of the nucleus .",
    "therefore its cross section @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 @xcite , while that of the incoherent scattering is simply proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "when the neutrino wavelength is much longer than the radius of the nucleus , the neutrino is coherently scattered by nucleons in the nucleus . in the collapsing iron core ,",
    "a typical value of the wavelength @xmath22 of a neutrino with energy @xmath23 is @xmath24 and that of the nuclear radius @xmath25 is @xmath26    the neutrino diffusion time scale is estimated by the random - walk relation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radius of the collapsing core and @xmath29 is the speed of light .",
    "the dynamical time scale of the core collapse is comparable to the free - fall time scale : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density of the core .",
    "when @xmath32 is greater than @xmath33 ( the corresponding density region is above @xmath34 ) , neutrinos can not escape from the inner core @xcite ; this phenomenon is called neutrino trapping . while neutrinos produced by electron capture",
    "remain in the inner core for the order of 10 msec , the lepton fraction @xmath35 , the lepton number per nucleon [ @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the number densities of electrons , neutrinos , neutrons and protons ] , stays in a range of about 0.3 - 0.4 .",
    "trapped neutrinos build up a degenerate sea , which suppresses electron capture .",
    "because the time scale of weak interaction processes is much shorter than @xmath41 , matter in the inner core is in @xmath42 equilibrium with trapped neutrinos . at densities @xmath43 ,",
    "matter consists of nuclei , electrons ( to maintain charge neutrality ) and neutrinos , and we shall refer to this simply as supernova matter ( snm ) @xcite .",
    "we show particle number density profiles in supernova matter in fig .",
    "[ wscell]-(b ) . since degenerate electrons are relativistic , screening effects are negligible and the electrons",
    "are uniformly distributed @xcite .",
    "there also exist the uniform neutrino gas and neutron - rich nuclei : clusters of protons and neutrons . in a certain density region below the normal nuclear density ,",
    "supernova matter could consist of nuclei with exotic shapes such as rod - like and slab - like nuclei rather than spherical ones , which are referred to as nuclear `` pasta '' ( a further explanation will be given in section [ sect_what ] ) .",
    "the pasta nuclei affect neutrino opacity of the supernova matter ( see section [ astro conseq ] ) .",
    "let us see further evolution of the bounced core .",
    "after bounce , the core settles into hydrostatic equilibrium on its dynamical time scale and a protoneutron star is formed unless the core is not so heavy that it collapses to a black hole .",
    "the initial radius and temperature of the protoneutron star are @xmath44 km and @xmath45 mev , respectively . just after the bounce of the core , the proton fraction @xmath46 , and the lepton fraction of matter in the core are relatively high ( both are around 0.3 ) .",
    "as neutrinos escape from the protoneutron star , it cools down and electron capture , which is blocked by the degenerate neutrinos , proceeds ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review of cooling of neutron stars ) .",
    "consequently matter gets neutron rich ; the proton fraction @xmath47 at around the normal nuclear density @xmath48 . at the same time",
    ", the radius of the object shrinks to @xmath45 km ; a neutron star is formed .",
    "neutron stars are dense and compact objects supported by neutron degeneracy pressure and nuclear forces",
    ". the mass and the radius of a typical neutron star are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the properties of dense matter and its equation of state are relatively well understood in the density region below @xmath51 .",
    "thus the theoretical picture of neutron star structure is reasonably established in the lower density region ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .    in fig .",
    "[ cross section of ns ] we show a schematic cross section of a typical cold neutron star below @xmath52 k. the outermost part , the envelope , is a layer about several meters thick which consists of liquid @xmath53 ( if there is accretion from its companion star , the envelope is covered by a layer of hydrogen and helium atoms ) . with increasing density ( i.e. , proceeding to the deeper region ) , weak interactions render nuclei neutron - rich via electron captures triggered by a large electron chemical potential .",
    "matter becomes solid at a density @xmath54 , which consists of nuclei forming a bcc coulomb lattice neutralized by a roughly uniform electrons .",
    "then , at a density of about @xmath55 , nuclei become so neutron rich that the last occupied neutron levels are no longer bound ; neutrons begin to drip out of these nuclei .",
    "these `` dripped ''",
    "neutrons form a superfluid amid the neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the crystalline region of the star is referred to as crust , which is divided into inner and outer crust ; in the outer crust there are no neutrons outside nuclei , while in the inner crust there are .",
    "the inner crust extends from the neutron drip point to the boundary with the core at a density @xmath56 , where nuclei disappear and the system becomes uniform nuclear matter .",
    "matter in these regions is called neutron star matter ( nsm ) @xcite . a schematic picture of neutron star matter at subnuclear densities is shown in fig .",
    "[ wscell]-(a ) .",
    "there exist dripped neutrons outside the neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "degenerate electrons are uniformly distributed for the same reason as in the case of supernova matter .",
    "another difference between supernova matter and neutron star matter is the lack of trapped degenerate neutrinos .",
    "this makes neutron star matter more neutron - rich than supernova matter in @xmath42 equilibrium . in the deepest region of the inner crust corresponding to subnuclear densities ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , pasta nuclei could appear ( see section [ sect_what ] for a further explanation ) . although crusts of neutron stars are relatively thin ( @xmath57 km ) , they influence many observed phenomena @xcite .",
    "effects of the pasta phases on these phenomena will be discussed in section [ astro conseq ] .",
    "the physics of the density region above several times normal nuclear density is quite uncertain , and a variety of hadronic phases have been proposed , such as hyperonic matter , pion or kaon condensates , quark - hadron mixed phase and uniform quark matter , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "these are beyond the scope of the present article .      in ordinary matter , atomic nuclei are roughly spherical .",
    "this may be understood in the liquid drop picture of the nucleus as being a result of the forces due to the surface tension of nuclear matter , which favors a spherical nucleus , being greater than those due to the electrical repulsion between protons , which tends to make the nucleus deform .",
    "when the density of matter approaches that of atomic nuclei , i.e. , the normal nuclear density @xmath48 , nuclei are closely packed and the effect of the electrostatic energy becomes comparable to that of the surface energy .",
    "consequently , at subnuclear densities around @xmath58 , the energetically favorable configuration is expected to have remarkable structures as shown in fig .",
    "[ pasta ] ; the nuclear matter region ( i.e. , the liquid phase of mixture of protons and neutrons ) is divided into periodically arranged parts of roughly spherical ( a ) , rod - like ( b ) or slab - like ( c ) shape , embedded in the gas phase and in a roughly uniform electron gas .",
    "besides , there can be phases in which nuclei are turned inside out , with cylindrical ( d ) or spherical ( e ) bubbles of the gas phase in the liquid phase . as mentioned in the previous section , these transformations are expected to occur in the deepest region of neutron star inner crusts and in the inner cores of collapsing stars just before the star rebounds . since slabs and rods look like `` lasagna '' and `` spaghetti '' , the phases with non - spherical nuclei are often referred to as `` pasta '' phases and such non - spherical nuclei as nuclear `` pasta . ''",
    "likewise , spherical nuclei and spherical bubbles are called `` meatballs '' and `` swiss cheese '' , respectively .    more than twenty years ago , ravenhall _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and hashimoto _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite independently pointed out that nuclei with such exotic shapes can be the most energetically stable due to the subtle competition between the nuclear surface and coulomb energies as mentioned above .",
    "let us here show this statement by a simple calculation using an incompressible liquid - drop model ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we consider five phases depicted in fig .",
    "[ pasta ] , which consist of spherical nuclei , cylindrical nuclei , planar nuclei , cylindrical bubbles and spherical bubbles , respectively .",
    "each phase is taken to be composed of a single species of nucleus or bubble at a given nucleon density @xmath59 averaged over the space . the total electrostatic energy including the lattice energy , which is the contribution to the coulomb energy coming from neighbouring nuclei , is estimated by the wigner - seitz approximation .    in the present discussion , we assume that the nuclear matter region is incompressible and the nucleon density there is fixed at the normal nuclear density @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "we further assume that the proton fraction @xmath62 in the nuclear matter region is fixed at @xmath63 and that the dripped neutrons can be ignored for simplicity .",
    "these assumptions correspond to the situation of supernova matter [ see fig .",
    "[ wscell]-(b ) ] . using a liquid - drop model , the total energy density of matter @xmath64 averaged over a single cell can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the volume fraction of the nuclei or bubbles , @xmath67 is the bulk energy density of the nuclear matter region , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are the nuclear surface , total electrostatic , and electron energy densities , respectively . under the assumption of neglecting the dripped neutrons , the volume fraction @xmath66 of nuclei [ bubbles ] is given as @xmath70 @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the electron number density @xmath37 , which is assumed to be uniform here , is @xmath72 @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "as we consider incompressible nuclear matter with fixed proton fraction @xmath62 , in the expression of @xmath64 [ eq .  ( [ total energy density ] ) ] only @xmath74 and @xmath75 depend on the nuclear shape at a given @xmath59 .",
    "thus the energetically most stable nuclear shape can be determined by comparing @xmath76 between each nuclear shape .",
    "the surface energy per unit volume @xmath74 is expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath20 is the surface tension , @xmath78 is the radius ( or the half width ) of nuclei or bubbles and @xmath79 is the dimensionality of the nuclear shape defined as @xmath80 for slabs , @xmath81 for cylinders or cylindrical holes and , @xmath82 for spheres or spherical holes .",

    "( [ surf+coulomb ] ) as a function of the nucleon number density @xmath59 .",
    "the symbols sp , c , s , ch , and sh stand for nuclear shapes , i.e. , sphere , cylinder , slab , cylindrical hole , and spherical hole , respectively .",
    "the transition points locate symmetrically with respect to the point of @xmath91 in the case of neglecting the bulk contribution.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we have plotted in fig .",

    "the point at @xmath93 , where the lines for all shapes and the line of @xmath94 cross each other , corresponds to uniform nuclear matter .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig surf+coulomb ] that the phase with spherical nuclei gives the lowest value of @xmath76 at lower densities below 0.215 @xmath48 , and , with increasing density , the most stable shape of the nuclear matter region changes as @xmath95    even though the pasta phases were favored energetically , whether or not they are actually present in the star depends on occurrence of the dynamical processes leading to their formation .",
    "our recent dynamical simulations @xcite have almost solved this problem ( see section [ sect_result ] ) .",
    "the presence of nuclear pasta would affect some astrophysical phenomena .",
    "it is noted that the pasta phases can occupy half of the total mass of the neutron star crusts @xcite and 10  20% of the mass of supernova cores in the later stage of the collapse @xcite . in this section",
    "we explain effects of the pasta phases on the neutrino trapping and the core dynamics of supernovae , pulsar glitches and cooling of neutron stars .",
    "formation of the pasta phases in collapsing cores would influence neutrino transport in the cores . as mentioned in section [ sn explosion ] ,",
    "this is considered to be crucial for reproduction of supernova explosions by simulation studies .",
    "due to neutrino - nucleus coherent scattering , the pasta phases have a large effect on the neutrino opacity of supernova matter @xcite .",
    "if one takes account of the pasta phases , they replace uniform matter close to a boundary between uniform and non - uniform phases ; the neutrino opacity of the pasta phases is significantly larger than that of uniform nuclear matter .",
    "this enhancement is elaborated with quantum molecular dynamic ( qmd ) simulations in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also section [ sect_md_nucleon ] for the framework of the qmd ) .",
    "the cross section for coherent neutrino scattering is approximated to be proportional to the static structure factor @xmath96 of neutrons , where @xmath97 is the wave number of the momentum transfer .",
    "the static structure factor is obtained by the fourier transform of a radial distribution function which represents two - point correlations . this quantity",
    "is remarkably increased near the wave number corresponding to the reciprocal lattice vector ; in the case of uniform matter this peak can not be seen .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ sq ] the static structure factor @xmath96 calculated for nucleon distributions of @xmath98 , 2 and 3 mev at @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath48 , where the phase with rod - like nuclei appears at low temperatures .",
    "the nucleon distributions are obtained by our qmd simulations , which will be explained in section [ sect_result ] .",
    "a peak around @xmath101  0.3 @xmath102 at each temperature indicates enhancement of the neutrino opacity ; at 1 mev the cross section around the peak exceeds one hundred times that for uniform matter . with increasing temperature , the peak height drops because nuclei start to melt ( see phase diagrams in section [ sect_result ] ) .",
    "the existence of pasta nuclei also affects the hydrodynamics of supernova cores .",
    "phase transition from a bcc lattice to uniform nuclear matter is considerably smoothed by the presence of the pasta phases , which modifies the equation of state used in core collapse simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the equation of state , the pasta phases also have an effect on the other hydrodynamic properties of supernova matter due to their different elastic properties from those of a crystalline lattice of spherical nuclei or uniform nuclear matter .",
    "although the above effects are crucial for supernova explosions , it is not obvious how they affect the explosions in detail ; this should be investigated by simulation studies of supernovae in the future .",
    "pulsars are neutron stars emitting periodic pulses , with a period equal to that of the rotation of the star . in more than 20 pulsars , sudden decreases of pulse periods ,",
    "i.e. , spinups of neutron star crusts , are observed .",
    "these phenomena are called `` glitches . ''",
    "there is not yet a consensus about the mechanism of glitches but a widely accepted theory is the vortex pinning model @xcite .    in neutron star crusts ,",
    "dripped neutrons form a superfluid and neutron - rich nuclei , which may be regarded as a normal fluid , act as a pinning center for vortex lines in the neutron superfluid . in the vortex pinning model glitches represent vorticity jumps following catastrophic unpinning of the vortex lines . since migrations of vortex lines result in transport of angular momentum , this leads to spinups of the crusts .",
    "it is obvious that the existence of the nuclear pasta would have a large influence on pinning .",
    "however , the force needed to pin the vortices and the pinning rate have yet to be clarified completely even for a bcc lattice of spherical nuclei , rather than for non - spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "there is another representative model of pulsar glitches : the starquake model @xcite .",
    "according to this model , a sudden starquake of the neutron star crust decreases the moment of inertia and hence increases the angular velocity .",
    "nuclei in the crust form a solid , coulomb lattice .",
    "the rigidity of the solid crust restores the force against deformation . when the stress in the crust reaches a critical value , the crust cracks .",
    "the existence of the pasta phases instead of the normal bcc lattice reduces the maximum elastic energy that can be stored in the crust because , as will be discussed in section [ sect_soft ] , the pasta phases have directions in which restoring force does not act like liquid crystals @xcite . thus the pasta phases would reduce the strength of each glitch and shorten the time separation between glitches in this scenario .      in the early epoch of the neutron star cooling ,",
    "the main process of energy loss by neutrinos is the so - called urca process : @xmath103 these reactions are dominant in the case that matter in the neutron star is hot and non - degenerate .",
    "however , when the matter becomes cold and degenerate as in a neutron star , the urca process is strongly suppressed by the energy and momentum conservation laws .",
    "the presence of non - spherical nuclei would accelerate the cooling of neutron stars by opening the direct urca reactions which are unlikely to occur for spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "this stems from the fact that , in non - spherical nuclei , protons have a continuous spectrum at the fermi surface in the elongated directions .",
    "the following reactions are generally accepted as the mechanism of generating neutrinos in cold and degenerate neutron stars : @xmath104 which is referred to as the modified urca process , and neutrino pair bremsstrahlung by electrons in the crust : @xmath105 in the modified urca process , a bystander neutron absorbs the momentum and relaxes kinematical constraints .",
    "pasta nuclei suppress the bremsstrahlung rate @xcite .",
    "if we assume that neutrino bremsstrahlung is dominated by the lowest reciprocal lattice vectors for which form factors do not vanish , the number of these vectors for each dimensional lattice leads to the neutrino emission rate of spherical , cylindrical and planar nuclei in the ratio of 6:3:1 .",
    "if the nucleons in the core undergo a transition to a superfluid and/or superconducting state , the modified urca process is suppressed by a factor of @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the superfluid energy gap . in this case",
    "bremsstrahlung is dominant and the neutrino emission is suppressed efficiently as a consequence of the presence of pasta phases .",
    "nuclear systems can be regarded as complex fluids of nucleons .",
    "complex fluids are the systems in which scales of the fluid and their constituents can not be separated clearly ; both scales are strongly connected with each other .",
    "such characteristic can be seen in various soft condensed matter systems .",
    "for example , polymer systems are one of the typical complex fluids ( description of polymer systems in the present section is mainly based on an instructive review @xcite ) .",
    "actually , similar spatial structures to nuclear pasta as shown in fig .",
    "[ pasta ] can be seen in some polymer systems such as domain structures in solutions and melts of block copolymers .",
    "thus it would be interesting to compare the hierarchical structure of nuclear systems with that of polymer systems .",
    "polymers are made up of monomers connected by covalent bondings and their degrees of polymerization are quite large ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "consequently , in polymer systems , the scale of constituents is as large as that of macroscopic phenomena such as phase separation of the domain structures .",
    "thus polymer systems behave as complex fluids . in nuclear systems ,",
    "the nature of a complex fluid is caused by strong and short range nuclear force .    in fig .",
    "[ fig hierarchy ] , we show the hierarchical structures of nuclear systems and of polymer systems . nuclear pasta phases and domain structures of block copolymers can be classified in the semimacroscopic scale .",
    "thus theoretical methods based on the mesoscopic or semimacroscopic scales are practical for studying these systems . in the study of polymer systems , the density functional theory and the ginzburg - landau theory correspond to such approaches . in nuclear physics",
    ", we have the thomas - fermi theory and the liquid - drop model , which are based on the scale of the nucleon density profile and of the nucleus , respectively .",
    "actually , thermodynamic properties of the pasta phases and phase diagrams at zero - temperature have been investigated so far mainly by these approaches .",
    "however , the nature of complex fluids of nuclear systems sets limits on the validity of the above methods . they can not be used for investigating phenomena in which microscopic degrees of freedom are important : formation process of the pasta phases , thermal fluctuations and melting of the pasta structures are typical examples .",
    "however , due to the short range nuclear interaction , characteristic ratio of the macroscopic or semimacroscopic scale in nuclear systems is much smaller than that of polymer systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig hierarchy ] ) .",
    "such a small characteristic ratio enables us to study the pasta phases by microscopic approaches based on the nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "our simulations are performed using one of these methods , which will be explained in the next section .",
    "similarity between the pasta phases and some phases of liquid crystals should be also mentioned here . for the pasta phases with rod - like nuclei and slab - like nuclei ,",
    "there are directions in which the system is translationally invariant .",
    "consequently , any restoring forces do not act along such directions . as noted by pethick and his coworkers",
    "@xcite , this situation is analogous with a liquid crystal rather than with a rigid solid .",
    "elastic properties of the phases with rod - like nuclei and with slab - like ones are thus characterized by elastic constants used for the corresponding liquid crystal phases , i.e. , columnar phases and smectics a , respectively .    for the layered phases such as smectic a liquid crystals and the pasta phase with slab - like nuclei , the energy density @xmath109 due to displacement @xmath110 of layers in their normal direction ( taken to be parallel to the @xmath111-axis ) can be written as @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 shows the derivative on the @xmath114-@xmath115 plane .",
    "the elastic constants @xmath116 and @xmath117 are associated with change of the layer spacing and with bending of the slabs .    for the two - dimensional triangular lattice in the columnar phase of liquid crystals or in the pasta phase with rod - like nuclei ,",
    "the energy density due to a two - dimensional displacement vector @xmath118 of rods running along the @xmath111-axis is given by @xcite @xmath119 + \\frac{k_3}{2}\\left (    \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\epsilon$}}{\\partial z^2}\\right)^2    + o(\\epsilon^3)\\ .\\label{elast_rod}\\ ] ] the elastic constant @xmath116 is associated with uniform translational compression or dilation , @xmath120 with transverse shear and @xmath121 with bending of the rods .",

    "these earlier works have confirmed that , for various nuclear models , the nuclear shape changes in the way of eq .",

    "@xcite .    in these earlier works , however , a liquid drop model or the thomas - fermi approximation is used with an assumption on the nuclear shape ( except for ref .",
    "thus the phase diagram at subnuclear densities and the existence of the pasta phases should be examined without assuming the nuclear shape .",
    "it is also noted that at temperatures of several mev , which are relevant to the collapsing cores , effects of thermal fluctuations on the nucleon distribution are significant .",
    "however , these thermal fluctuations can not be described properly by mean - field theories such as the thomas - fermi approximation used in the previous work @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the equilibrium properties , dynamical or non - equilibrium aspects of the pasta phases had not been studied until recently except for some limited cases @xcite .",
    "thus it had been unclear even whether or not the pasta phases can be formed dynamically within the time scale of the cooling of neutron stars nor whether or not the formation of the pasta phases and the transitions between them can be realized under non - equilibrium conditions in collapsing stellar cores .",
    "especially , the latter problem is highly non - trivial because these processes are accompanied by drastic changes of nuclear shape .    to solve the above problems , molecular dynamic approaches for nucleon many - body systems ( a comprehensive overview is given by ref .",
    "@xcite ) are suitable .",
    "they treat the motion of the nucleonic degrees of freedom and can describe thermal fluctuations and many - body correlations beyond the mean - field level .",
    "molecular dynamics for nucleons were originally developed for studying nuclear reactions , especially the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "nowadays there are various versions including the fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) @xcite , the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite and the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite , etc . , which differ in the form of the trial wave functions .",

    ", qmd is the most practical for studying the pasta phases , which allows us to treat large systems consisting of several nuclei .",
    "the typical length scale @xmath144 of half of the inter - structure is @xmath145 fm and the density region of interest is around half of the normal nuclear density @xmath146 .",
    "the total nucleon number @xmath147 necessary to reproduce @xmath148 structures in the simulation box is @xmath149 ( for slabs ) .",
    "it is thus desirable to use @xmath150 nucleons in order to reduce boundary effects .",
    "such large systems are difficult to be handled by fmd and amd , whose calculation costs increase as @xmath151 , but are tractable for qmd , whose calculation costs increase as @xmath152 like ordinary classical molecular dynamics calculations ( we will see the reason of this difference later ) .",
    "it is also noted that we mainly focus on the nuclear structure from mesoscopic to macroscopic scales ( see section [ sect_soft ] ) , where the exchange effect would be less important .",
    "therefore , it is expected that qmd is a reasonable approximation for studying the pasta phases even though it is less elaborate on the treatment of the exchange effect than fmd and amd . especially , at finite temperatures of several mev , validity of qmd is ensured because the shell structure ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the shell effects in the pasta phases ) caused from the exchange effect is washed out by thermal fluctuations above @xmath153 mev .",
    "a general startpoint of constructing molecular dynamic approaches for nucleons is the time dependent variational principle : @xmath154 where the time integral in the right hand side is the action . if the variation @xmath155 of the state @xmath156 or @xmath157 is unrestricted in the whole hilbert space except for the fixed end points at time @xmath158 and @xmath159 , eq .",

    "thus it is necessary to incorporate effects of the pauli exclusion principle in some way to reproduce fermionic nature : one of the solutions is introducing the pauli potential @xmath177 . the pauli potential , a two - body repulsive potential , which depends on the relative momentum as well as the relative coordinate distance , mimics the pauli principle by reproducing the exchange repulsive force phenomenologically , i.e. , by suppressing the phase space density of identical particles .",

    "therefore , the pauli potential which try to imitate the pauli principle by two - body interaction can not exactly describe quantum correlations and quantum statistical properties . using this framework ,",
    "we thus can not obtain correct results for quantities sensitive to the quantum fluctuations in the many - body system , such as the specific heat at low temperatures @xcite .      in our studies on the pasta phases ,",
    "we have used a qmd model hamiltonian developed by maruyama _",
    "this model hamiltonian consists of four parts : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the kinetic energy ; @xmath177 is the pauli potential of the gaussian form given by eq .",
    "( [ gaussian pauli ] ) ; @xmath185 is the nuclear interaction which contains the skyrme potential ( an effective zero - range nuclear interaction ) , symmetry energy , and momentum dependent potential ; @xmath186 is the coulomb energy between protons .",

    "the above model hamiltonian reproduces the properties of nuclear matter around the normal nuclear density ( i.e. , the saturation density , binding energy , symmetry energy , and incompressibility ) , and of finite nuclei in the ground state , especially of heavier ones relevant to our interest @xcite .",
    "other properties of this hamiltonian , which are important for the pasta phases ( e.g. , the surface tension ) are investigated in ref .",
    "it is also confirmed that a qmd hamiltonian close to this model provides a good description of nuclear reactions including the low energy region ( several mev per nucleon ) @xcite .",
    "using the framework of qmd , we have solved the following two major questions @xcite .",
    "1 ) whether or not the pasta phases are formed by cooling down hot uniform nuclear matter in a finite time scale smaller than that of the neutron star cooling ? 2 ) whether or not transitions between the pasta phases can occur by compression of matter during the collapse of a star ? in the present section , we would like to review our these works .    in our simulations , we treated the system which consists of neutrons , protons , and electrons in a cubic box with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the system is not magnetically polarized , i.e. , it contains equal numbers of protons ( and neutrons ) with spin up and spin down .",
    "relativistic degenerate electrons which ensure charge neutrality can be regarded as a uniform background because electron screening is negligibly small at relevant densities around @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "consequently , one must take account of the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction ( see also a discussion in ref .",
    "we calculate the coulomb interaction by the ewald summation procedure @xcite taking account of the gaussian charge distribution of the proton wave packets ( see appendix a in ref .",

    "when we try to classify the nuclear structure systematically , the integral mean curvature and the euler characteristic ( a brief explanation is provided in appendix [ sect_euler ] ) are useful . here",
    "we introduce their normalized quantities : the area - averaged mean curvature @xmath201 , and the euler characteristic density @xmath202 ( @xmath203 is the volume of the whole space ) . using a combination of these two quantities calculated for nuclear surface , in our simulations . ]",

    "effects of the finite box size on the density regions of the phases with negative @xmath205 should be examined in the future .",
