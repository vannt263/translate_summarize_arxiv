    "figure 10 presents the final planetary systems for each of these simulations .",
    "the planetary statistics ( as described in section 4.1 ) for the final planetary systems are listed in table 4 and labelled cbecc_.2_.5_.5 ( a  e ) .",
    "table 4 also re - states the analogous statistics for the five original runs with @xmath6 = 0.2 au and @xmath7 = 0.5 that we performed , labelled as cb_.2_.5_.5 ( a  e ) .",
    "we used a k - s test to compare planetary systems resulting from the two sets of simulations , and found that the distributions for each of the statistics listed are statistically consistent .",
    "we thus conclude that our choice of initial conditions for our nominal circumbinary disk are sufficient even for the highly eccentric binary star systems examined in this article .",
    "one planetesimal in simulation cbecc_.2_.5_.5_e ended up stranded in a distant orbit , with periapse well beyond the orbits of the giant planets ( figure 11 ) .",
    "this planetesimal was scattered outwards by the giant planets at @xmath40 = 23.6 yr , and became trapped in a 5:2 resonance with the outer giant planet at @xmath40 = 27.8 yr .",
    "this resonance substantially reduced the planetesimal s eccentrity to @xmath39 = 0.4 , raising its periapse distance to above the apoapse of the orbit of the outermost giant planet ( the apoapse of this never exceeded @xmath107 = 10.84 au during the entire integration ) .",
    "the planetesimal broke free of the resonance around @xmath40 = 47.8 yr , but its periapse distance remained high for the remainder of the simulation .",
    "it is clearly in a chaotic orbit , capable of returning to the planetary region and being ejected from the system , but this may well not occur for many millions , if not billions , of years .",
    "similar processes may have operated to remove trans - neptunian objects in our solar system from neptune s immediate control , and if they happened during the migration epoch of the giant planets , such objects could have been permanently stranded away from the planetary region ( gomes et al .",
    "the ensemble of plausible initial conditions for simulations of planetary growth is immense .",
    "fortunately , one single numerical simulation ( or a set thereof ) may be valid for a range of stellar and planetary masses , orbital periods , etc . for simulations to correspond exactly",
    ", the following must apply :    ( 1 ) : :    the ratios of the masses of all of the bodies must be the same , i.e. ,    there is a uniform factor by which all masses must be multiplied ,    @xmath108 . ( 2 ) : :    the ratios of the distances between objects must be multipled by an    equal amount @xmath109 , and the physical sizes of the    objects , as well as other factors involving removal of objects ( inner ,    outer boundaries in semimajor axis ) , must be multiplied by this same    factor @xmath109 .",
    "note that , in general , the densities of    objects will change according to the following formula :    +    @xmath110 ( 3 ) : :    initial ( and thus subsequent ) velocities must be scaled so that    orbital geometries remain the same ( `` orbital elements '' ) .",
    "for this to    hold , the ratio of kinetic to potential energy must remain the same ,    so    +    @xmath111    +    @xmath112    +    therefore ,    +    @xmath113 ( 4 ) : :    time must scale in a manner such that the same processes take the same    number of orbits , so :    +    @xmath114    one example of this scaling is that if the star s mass is increased , and those of the planetesimals / planetary embryos are increased by the same amount , then the simulations would be applicable either if planetesimal densities increase by this amount or if distances grow by the same factor as the physical radii of the planetesimals .",
    "a less trivial example is that a simulation of the growth of rocky planetesimals with @xmath115 = 4 g @xmath24 at 2 au corresponds to rock - ice planetesimals with @xmath115 = 1.5 g @xmath24 at 2.77 au around the same single star or around another binary with the same masses but with a 38% larger semimajor axis .",
    "note that we are free to select any positive values for two parameters ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the above discussion ) , but that these choices specify the values of the other three parameters .",
    "collisional outcomes must also be scaled appropriately , although this is trivially satisfied by the `` perfect accretion '' assumption used herein . additionally , any luminosity - related items , temperature related items , radiation forces , etc .",
    "( none of which were included in our simulations ) must be scaled appropriately .",
