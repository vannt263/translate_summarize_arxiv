    "the interferometry method to measure particle phase space densities averaged over the volume of a system that emits the particles was first proposed by bertsch @xcite .",
    "if systems formed in ultrarelativistic a+a collisions are thermal , then it is possible to compare the experimental value of the average phase - space density ( apsd ) with one associated with the bose - einstein @xcite or fermi - dirac @xcite thermal distributions , @xmath0 and extract in this way a particle chemical potential ( or fugacity ) at the freeze - out temperature .",
    "such a chemical potential could have a positive value even for pions since a hadron gas evolution is chemically frozen rather than chemically equilibrated @xcite .",
    "if it turns out that the particle fugacity is fairly large , then the boson density could be around the critical one and significant multibosonic @xcite , and coherent @xcite effects might be present at low particle momenta .",
    "there are , however , two serious problems which have to be solved to apply the above method .",
    "it is obvious that the apsd @xmath1 can be associated directly with a thermally equilibrated distribution for static homogeneous fireballs , @xmath2 for bosons .",
    "for expanding inhomogeneous systems , characterized by a set of ( local ) equilibrium distributions which are doppler shifted in the vicinities of each space - time point according to the collective velocity field , the phase - space density _ averaged over some hypersurface _ situated at or `` after '' the freeze - out could lose , in general , the direct connection to the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac phase - space distributions . as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , even at a uniform temperature and chemical potential at freeze - out , the intensity and profile of longitudinal and transverse flows influence very essentially the value of @xmath3 , making , thus , the extraction of fugacity by comparison with @xmath2 ambiguous and model dependent .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to study and substantiate the model independent possibility for an analysis of overpopulation of the phase - space in 3d expanding fireballs at freeze - out .",
    "the another problem is resonance contributions to particle spectra and interferometry radii @xcite .",
    "if chemical freeze - out takes place , then about 2/3 of pions comes from decays of resonances in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "only a small part of them are long - lived resonances which give the effect of a halo @xcite - a suppression of correlation functions of identical pions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the others , short - lived , enhance significantly the pion single - particle spectrum , as compare to the thermal pion one , and also modify the interferometry radii .",
    "our analysis of pion production by some _ concrete _ resonance species shows that even for thermal distribution of those resonance species at freeze - out the spectrum of the produced pions is far from the thermal one .",
    "also , an effective region of such a pion emission at small momenta is not associated with the interferometry volume at the corresponding small mean momenta of pion pairs from the resonance decays .",
    "peculiarities of pion production by resonances are important to understand the influence of resonance decays on the average phase - space densities which are currently measured in experiments at cern sps and bnl rhic .",
    "we analyse quantitatively the total effect on spectra and interferometry volume of pion production by huge number of resonances with masses up to 2 gev and dependence of the effect on the intensity of flows . as a result , we propose how to cope with the resonance contributions to study the freeze - out properties of the expanding systems .",
    "one of the most serious challenges to the theoretical understanding of the processes of a+a collisions is multiplicity ( and energy ) dependence of the apsd @xmath4 in central events .",
    "according to the bertsch result @xcite @xmath5 @xmath6 if at different energies of a+a collisions the pion interferometry volume @xmath7 of the created systems is proportional to the pion multiplicity @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , the effective temperature of the transverse spectra of pions , changes only slightly , then approximate constancy of the apsd could be considered a the natural property of the system at freeze - out in high energy a+a collisions .",
    "it was a very likely hypothesis at relatively small energies @xcite , since it had been supported by the observed proportionally between @xmath8 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , this proportionally law starts to be violated already at sps energies and is completely destroyed in experiments at rhic @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the interferometry radii and volume turn out to be essentially smaller than was expected at the corresponding rhic multiplicities ( the hbt puzzle ) @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the apsd at rhic energies is found to be the considerably higher than at the formerly achieved energies @xcite .",
    "does this mean that freeze - out conditions of the system in heavy ion collisions at rhic are essentially different from the ones at sps ?",
    "does this signify that the freeze - out particle densities at rhic come close to the critical value ?",
    "the latter could lead to the multibosonic effects at freeze - out which , in turn , can reduce the observed hbt radii @xcite .",
    "are thus multibosonic effects relevant to the hbt puzzle ?    to understand the above problems we study the apsd and particle density temporal evolution in a few hydrodynamic models .",
    "we observe , in particular , that the phase - space density averaged over the freeze - out volume , @xmath1 , drops rather slowly during the 3d expansion of the system , - much slower than the phase - space density @xmath10 at any fixed @xmath11 and than the particle density .",
    "this difference in the behavior of the two groups of values becomes bigger when the intensity of the transverse flow grows .",
    "the detailed analysis of this effect as well as the model independent estimates of chemical potential for the thermal pions at freeze - out makes it possible to shed light on the reason of the relatively high apsd at rhic and on the hbt puzzle .",
    "let us demonstrate the important features of the apsd evolution versus particle density one by one using hydrodynamic models of a+a collisions . to see the main idea we start from the exact solutions of perfect non - relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "if the initial conditions correspond to the thermal boltzmann distribution with uniform temperature @xmath13 , zero initial flows , @xmath14 , and spherically symmetric gaussian ( with radius @xmath15 ) profile of particle density , then the hydrodynamic evolution of that system is described by the local equilibrium phase - space distribution which is an exact solution of boltzmann equation for any cross - section of particle interactions @xcite and has the form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is total number of particles,@xmath18 are their velocities , and @xmath19 .",
    "one can check directly that the momentum spectrum and the interferometry radii , evaluated at any time @xmath20 ( at any isotherm ) are identical to those calculated at the initial time @xmath21 . the easiest way to see",
    "it is to rewrite expression ( [ hydro ] ) in the form    @xmath22    where the effective temperature of the spectra is a constant in time and _ equal to the initial one _ , @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the maximal phase space density and bertsch s average phase - space density @xcite    @xmath24    is the same at each @xmath25 as it was at the initial time !",
    "the space density of the particles falls down with time as @xmath26 at large @xmath20 .",
    "so , the particles in the system will really stop interacting at some later stage and the system decouples , preserving its maximal psd and average psd values as they were at the moment when the fireball was created .",
    "it is noteworthy that the local phase - space density @xmath27 in the system drops with time at any fixed point @xmath28very rapidly , as @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the perfect constancy of the apsd is caused by the peculiarities of this specific model : in particular , its spherical symmetry , as was discussed in detail in ref",
    ". @xcite . at the same time , as we will demonstrate , the important feature of this simple model , namely , the principal distinction in temporal behaviours of different types of densities , is preserved in realistic models of a+a collisions : the apsd decreases with time essentially slower than the particle density .    to make the next step towards clarifying the effect ,",
    "let us consider one more analytical illustration of it based on the model of a 3d expanding fireball with longitudinally bjorken - like flow @xmath30 .",
    "here is the exact non - relativistic solution of the ideal hydro equations for an initially gaussian transverse density profile which results in the following evolution of the locally equilibriated phase - space density @xcite :    @xmath31    where the initial particle density in the central part of system , @xmath32 , is @xmath33 and @xmath34 at each moment @xmath20 the longitudinal spectrum in this model is @xmath35 @xmath36 , similar to @xmath37 @xmath38 in the relativistic boost - invariant model , and the momentum spectrum is    @xmath39    where the effective temperature , @xmath9 , is @xmath40 the @xmath41 does not change much since the decrease of temperature @xmath42 when the system expands is accompanied by the increase of transverse flows described by @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ hyd - sol2 ] ) .",
    "the typical behavior of the temperature and effective temperature in this model can be seen in fig . 1 .    the interferometry radii , _",
    "out- , side- _ and _ long- _ take the forms @xmath44 and are similar to the ones in the relativistic case at the central rapidity point @xcite , if @xmath45 . the interferometry volume , taking into account ( [ hyd - sol2 ] ) , is @xmath46 and does not change significantly since it depends on @xmath47 only .",
    "so , it is not surprising after all , that the apsd is , at least approximately , preserved with time    @xmath48    the average momentum phase - space density , @xmath49 , as well as the interferometry volume @xmath7 , will be preserved in time if and when , at some stage of the evolution , @xmath50 is constant in time .",
    "practically , the effective temperature , and thus the apsd @xmath51 , could be slightly reduced or even increased with time during the evolution , depending on initial conditions , the evolution stage and particle mass .",
    "behavior of the effective temperature is correlated unambiguously with the behavior of particle transverse energy per unit of rapidity ( or average particle transverse momentum ) . in the idealized case of",
    "the 1d longitudinal expansion of a one - component gas , the particle transverse energy per unit of rapidity can only decrease since the effective temperature of the transverse spectrum in that case is just the system s temperature that falls down permanently .",
    "however , in a realistic case when transverse expansion is switched on , the transformation of a system s heat energy into the transverse and longitudinal kinetic energies of particles becomes much more complicated . in the 3d expansion the diminution of the total energy of the part of the hydrodynamic tube confined within a small rapidity interval",
    "is accompanied by a faster decrease in the particle longitudinal kinetic energy , comparing to the 1d case .",
    "it is caused by faster temperature decrease , while longitudinal collective velocities are the same in that piece of fluid .",
    "as for the transverse energy , it accounts for not only a decrease of the heat energy , associated with temperature , but also an increase with time of transverse flows",
    ". therefore , the particle transverse energy ( in the relativistic case it is better to consider average transverse momentum of particles ) essentially does not change during the evolution .",
    "such a process of transformation of heat into transverse flow is accompanied by an appearance of positive correlations between the absolute value of particle transverse momentum and its distance from the centre of the system .",
    "the degree of that correlation grows with time compensating for the contribution of increasing geometrical radii to the interferometry volume @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "since the transverse momentum spectra do not change much , the apsd @xmath53 becomes about constant at some stage of evolution unlike the local phase - space density @xmath54 and particle density .",
    "the latter is just a fast monotonically decreasing function ( see ( [ f - def ] ) ) :    @xmath55    this is one of our main points - the system can reach small densities and decay with rather high apsd reflecting the high average phase - space density at the moment when the system was formed !",
    "now we pass from general physical ideas to the concrete results within the realistic model of pb+pb collisions at cern energies @xmath56 agev @xcite .",
    "the model describes hydrodynamically the evolution of chemically frozen hadron - resonance gas from the hadronization stage to the thermal , or kinetic , freeze - out .",
    "as was found recently @xcite , if chemical freeze - out is incorporated into hydrodynamics , then the final spectra and fireball lifetimes are insensitive to the temperature at which the switch from hydrodynamics to cascade rqmd is made .",
    "this implies that the local conservation law describing the transformation of heat energy into collective flows for a chemically frozen hydrodynamic evolution results in spectra which correspond approximately to the microscopic cascade calculations .",
    "based on an analysis of the particle number ratios , pion rapidity density at @xmath57 slopes of transverse spectra and values of interferometry radii for pions , kaons and protons , the reconstruction of the hadronization stage was done in ref . @xcite by solving backwards in time the hydrodynamic equations for the chemically frozen composition of mesons and baryons with masses up to 2 gev .",
    "the  initial conditions  for such a solution were defined from an analysis of spectra and correlations at the thermal freeze - out stage .",
    "supposing that the hadronization of bjorken - like expanding quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) happens at a uniform chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath58 with gaussian - like particle density transverse profile of some width @xmath59 and self - similar transverse flow @xmath60 , one can restore from the hydrodynamic solutions the hadronization proper time @xmath61 , transverse radius @xmath62 , transverse velocity @xmath63@xmath64@xmath65 at the gaussian  boundary  of the system , and then the energy and particle number densities in the center of the system , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the temperature @xmath58 and baryonic chemical potential @xmath68 are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of particle number ratios .",
    "the characteristics of the chemical freeze - out in pb+pb sps collisions at 158 agev taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all the values",
    "are related to the negative pions .",
    "the values in square brackets in the last column of table 3 are the critical pion densities ( in the rest frames of the fluid elements ) at the correspondent temperatures for one ( negative ) component of the isospin pion triplet .",
    "as we can conclude , no exotic phenomena associated with the overpopulation of phase - space could be expected at the current energies .",
    "some increase of the apsd takes place at rhic ; the pion chemical potentials are higher than at sps and correspondingly the pion number density at rhic is closer to the critical value for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "however the density values are still too small to expect the critical phenomena , such as serious spreading of multiplicity distributions , significant reduction of the interferometry radii , etc . , which are associated with the bose - einstein condensation of pions in momentum space .",
    "note , as was discussed above , our estimates of the pion densities at the end of the hydrodynamic stage of the evolution are , at the same time , the upper limits for the  emission capacity  density of the source of the direct pions .",
    "the apsds per pion component in the chemically equilibrated neutral pion gas are @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 gev and @xmath72 gev respectively .",
    "as one can see from the table 2 , the estimated apsd for thermal pions are somewhat higher than in the case of chemical equilibrium .",
    "thereby some corrections to observables conditioned by the partial overpopulation of the pion phase - space should be taken into account in advanced models of a+a collisions .",
    "an approach which allows one to estimate the chemical potential and , thus , the overpopulation of particle phase - space at thermal freeze - out in a way that does not depend on the flow profile and form of the freeze - out hypersurface has been developed .",
    "it realizes bertsch s basic idea to find from the interferometry data the phase - space density averaged over both configuration and momentum spaces and compare it with the correspondent value for static source with equilibrium ( homogeneous ) bose - einstein thermal distribution to estimate thereby the overpopulation of the phase - space .",
    "we have proved that under the assumption of uniformity of particle density at the freeze - out hypersurface the flows and form of the hypersurface are absorbed into a factor that is canceled when the apsd is determined .",
    "it is worth to note that such a `` cancellation '' takes place not only for the apsd .",
    "for example , as one can find easily under the same conditions , the thermal pion entropy per particle also does not depend on the form of the hypersurface and flows .",
    "another problem that has been analysed is the resonance contributions to pion phase space densities . because of chemical freeze - out an essential fraction of pions , about half ,",
    "will be produced by short - lived resonances after thermal freeze - out .",
    "it is found that the decays of many heavy resonances correct significantly the interferometry radii of direct pions .",
    "it could result in up to a @xmath73 per cent increase of the correspondent interferometry volume at small transverse momenta .",
    "since the heavy resonances have , typically , large momentum @xmath74 of pions produced , the resonances contribute to the interferometry radii up to @xmath75 gev .",
    "one of the important consequences of this is the ratio of the outward interferometry radius to the sideward one , @xmath76 , that becomes _ less than unity _ due to heavy resonance",
    "decays in contrast to standard results @xmath77 for direct pions in the hydrodynamic models ( except for the so - called  blast - wave ",
    "model @xcite , see footnote 1 ) .",
    "it could be a step towards understanding the hbt puzzle .",
    "the correlation function of two identical pions arising from decays of heavy resonances of fixed species , even if one neglects their life - times , is essentially non - gaussian , especially at small pion transverse momenta .",
    "then , if one gets the interferometry radii from a gaussian fit to the correlation function in the region of the interferometry peak , the longitudinal radii will be larger than the homogeneity lengths of regions where the spectra of  resonance pions \" are formed .",
    "this violates the natural physical correlation @xmath78 that is typical for direct particles .",
    "accounting for the finite life - times of resonances makes the picture even more complicated : the emission is now spread out in time direction and therefore the @xmath7 can not be attributed to the thermal freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "we have argued thereby that resonance contributions should be excluded when the averaged pion phase - space densities at the freeze - out stage are determined .",
    "our estimates of the total and thermal spectra and the ratios of correspondent interferometry volumes at different intensities of transverse flow , including what are typical for sps and rhic energies , gives the possibility of restoring the apsd of thermal pions at thermal freeze - out .",
    "we argue that the values found are the maximal ( total ) pion apsd at and after the decoupling of the hydrodynamic system .",
    "we found that the overpopulation of thermal pions at the thermal freeze - out , @xmath79 mev , is associated with the pion chemical potentials @xmath80 mev for pb+pb(au ) 158 agev collisions at cern sps and @xmath81 mev for au+au @xmath82 gev collisions at bnl rhic .",
    "the estimates of the correspondent values in the recent paper @xcite based on the concrete hydrodynamic parametrization are close to our results for sps energies , while for rhic energies the pions chemical potentials estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite are somewhat higher .",
    "the thermal pion densities turn out to be essentially smaller than the critical ones .",
    "the correspondent values at the sps energies are @xmath83 @xmath84 for @xmath85 mev and @xmath86 @xmath84 for @xmath87 mev . for the rhic energies we found @xmath88 @xmath84 for @xmath85 mev and @xmath89 @xmath84 for @xmath87 mev .",
    "thereby the multibosonic effects at those energies would be considered rather as a correction factor than as an important physical phenomenon .",
    "it looks puzzling that the averaged phase- space densities of thermal pions at rhic are higher than at sps , @xmath90 while the particle freeze - out densities are comparable .",
    "the detailed analysis of the evolution of the apsd could explain such a behaviour .",
    "indeed , if one imagines that at some initial time hadronic system has no significant transverse flow , then the averaged psd is proportional to the psd and particle density , as in a hot , dense gas in a box , and all the densities are high .",
    "however , when the system expands and transverse flow develops , the behaviors of the apsd and particle density are completely different .",
    "while the pion density is reduced dramatically , at the last stage as @xmath91 , the pion apsd changes ( it can even increase ) rather slowly . thereby the systems reach kinetic freeze - out at some typical particle densities that are similar for different collision energies , and , at the same time , their apsd could increase with energy since it `` memorizes '' the higher initial hadronic densities at higher energies .",
    "it is found that such a `` memory '' is conditioned by the conservation of entropy and particle numbers during chemically frozen hydrodynamic evolution of the mixture of hadronic gases .    the main aspect of the hbt puzzle concerns the energy dependence of the interferometry volume that turns out essentially smaller than expected at the rhic energies .",
    "our results could shed light on this phenomenon . since the pion apsd and effective transverse temperature do not change essentially during the evolution , the ",
    "interferometry volume ",
    ", @xmath92 , defined formally at any time during the evolution of hadronic system , also changes rather slowly with time .",
    "the concrete mechanism of the effect is that , if the intensity of the transverse flow grows during the evolution , the contribution of an enlarged geometric radius of the expanding system to the interferometry volume is almost compensated by a stronger reduction of the interferometry radii due to the strengthening of the flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the initial effective volume is , thus , partially frozen in the form of the interferometry volume .",
    "there is a rough similarity between the effective , or `` interferometry '' volumes at higher ( rhic ) and smaller ( sps ) energies because the larger configuration volume at hadronization stage at rhic ( particle densities at the hadronization are approximately the same as at the sps ) is partially compensated by the higher intensities of flow . therefore , the unexpectedly small increase of the interferometry volume at rhic is caused by strengthening of transverse flows at higher energies . during the evolution of hadronic system the apsd",
    "is reduced rather slowly (  frozen  ) while the particle density falls down quickly until it reaches the standard conditions for system decay .",
    "that is the reason why the observed value of the apsd has no direct link to the freeze - out criteria and final thermodynamic parameters , being connected rather to the initial phase - space density of hadronic matter formed in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",

    "<S> the analysis of the evolution of the pion average phase - space density in chemically frozen hadron systems shows that it is almost constant or slightly increases with time while the particle density and phase - space density at each space point drops down rapidly during the system s expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we found that , unlike the particle density , the average phase - space density has no direct link to the freeze - out criterion and final thermodynamic parameters , being connected rather to the initial phase - space density of hadronic matter formed in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .    </S>",
