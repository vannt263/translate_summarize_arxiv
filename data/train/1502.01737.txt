    "t2k is the tokai - to - kamioka long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment @xcite .",
    "the physical motivations behind the t2k experiment are the determination of the value of oscillation parameter @xmath2 , by searching for the @xmath3 oscillation phenomenon , and a precise measurement of oscillation parameter @xmath4 by measuring @xmath5 oscillation .",
    "the t2k experiment utilizes a high - intensity neutrino beam from proton accelerators at the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) @xcite , which have a design beam power of 750 kw , and the super - kamiokande detector @xcite as a far detector , which is at a 295-km distance from j - parc .",
    "an important feature of the t2k neutrino beam is that it is narrow - band and uses an off - axis beam method @xcite .",
    "the beam axis direction is oriented at 2.5@xmath6 with respect to the direction of the super - kamiokande detector . in this case",
    ", the neutrino energy distribution at the super - kamiokande detector has a narrow distribution peaking at 0.6 gev , for which the oscillation probability at the 295-km baseline is at a maximum .",
    "a proton beam with kinetic energy of 30 gev ( design intensity = @xmath7 protons / pulse ) is extracted from the main ring to the t2k neutrino beamline once every 2.1 s , and is exposed to a production target composed of a graphite rod ( 2.6 cm in diameter and 90 cm in length ) .",
    "secondary particles such as pions and kaons are focused in the forward direction by three magnetic horns , where the target is embedded in the magnetic horn located in the furthest upstream .",
    "the secondary particles decay in flight and produce muon neutrinos ( purity @xmath8 99% ) when they travel along a 100-m - long decay volume .",
    "a beam dump , which is composed of segmented graphite blocks , is positioned at the end of the decay volume to absorb all the hadrons .",
    "the target , magnetic horns , decay volume , and beam dump are enclosed in a gigantic iron vessel ( @xmath81,500 m@xmath9 ) , the inner volume of which is filled with 1 atm of helium gas in order to reduce tritium ( @xmath9h ) and nitrogen oxide ( nox ) production .",
    "the helium atmosphere also works to greatly reduce the oxidation of the graphite material of the beam dump . a schematic drawing of the t2k secondary neutrino beamline is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondaryline ] and additional details of the t2k neutrino beamline are given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , details of the t2k magnetic horn system are provided .",
    "introductory information is given in section [ sec : horns ] , electrical properties in section [ sec : electrical ] , cooling performance in section [ sec : cooling ] , mechanical properties in section [ sec : mechanical ] , details of remote maintenance issues in section [ sec : remote ] and , finally , operational experience during beam operation for physics data - taking is reported in section [ sec : operation ] .",
    "the t2k magnetic horn system consists of three horns : horn-1 , horn-2 , and horn-3 , in order from upstream .",
    "secondary particles are emitted from the target with high angles of a few hundred mrad and low momenta of 1 - 4 gev / c .",
    "a field integral of 1.3 t@xmath10 m is required in order to focus those particles efficiently .",
    "the target is inserted inside the inner conductor of horn-1 so as to provide high collection efficiency , and a peak current of 320 ka is adopted for the t2k magnetic horns in order to achieve high magnetic field strength .",
    "the design philosophy and design optimization of the t2k magnetic horns are described in @xcite .",
    "the t2k horns consist of aluminum conductors , current feeding striplines , water and gas plumbing , and support frames .",
    "figure [ fig : horn_drawing ] shows drawings of the t2k magnetic horns .",
    "the aluminum conductors have coaxial conductor structures , with inner and outer conductors that are connected at the downstream end but insulated at the upstream end , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : horn1cross ] .",
    "the current first enters the inner conductor from the upstream end , returns through the outer conductor , and exits from the upstream end .",
    "a toroidal magnetic field is generated in the region between the inner and outer conductors .",
    "drawings of the aluminum conductors of horn-1 , horn-2 , and horn-3 are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : horn - shape ] ,        while typical dimensions are also listed in table [ tab : horndim ] .",
    ".typical dimensions of t2k magnetic horns .",

    "a magnetic horn system to realize a high - intensity neutrino beam was developed for the t2k experiment , and an electrical system for 320-ka operation was constructed .",
    "the heat transfer coefficient at the inner conductor surface following the use of sprayed water as a coolant is as high as 7.9 kw / m@xmath11k .",
    "this is sufficiently high to maintain maximum temperatures of below 50@xmath12c .",
    "however , for the stripline cooling by helium , the required flow rate was not achieved because of a helium leak around the remote clamp , which will be modified in the next version of this device .",
    "the conductor shapes are optimized using fem to ensure that the stress is maintained below an allowed value , and the measured vibrations are consistent with the predictions of the fem analyses .",
    "operation experience acquired during the t2k beam periods is also described .",
    "the t2k magnetic horns have been operated stably at 250 @xmath13 5 ka overall , however , several problems such as hydrogen production and air contamination were observed .",
    "the majority of these issues were solved , but countermeasures against the hydrogen problem are still under development .",
    "the first set of t2k magnetic horns has been operated for over 12 million pulses during four years of operation , from 2010 to 2013 , under a maximum beam power of 230 kw .",
    "no significant damage has been observed during this period .",
    "this successful operation has led to the discovery of the @xmath1 oscillation by the t2k experiment in 2013 @xcite .",
    "the authors thank the japanese ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology ( mext ) for their support of the t2k magnetic horn development .",
    "the t2k magnetic horns have been built and operated using funds provided by mext , japan , and the department of energy , u.s.a .",
    "in addition , the development of the t2k magnetic horns was partly supported by grands - in - aid for scentific research in japan .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge the tremendous support and effort from the j - parc accelerator division , and would also like to thank prof .",
    "yoshioka , prof .",
    "kobayashi , and prof .",
    "matsumoto from kek for their kind support and useful advice .",
    "finally , the authors would like to appreciate many discussions with researchers , who work for neutrino beamlines in the world , and useful information from them ."
