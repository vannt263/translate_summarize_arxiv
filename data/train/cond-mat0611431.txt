    "in this paper new critical behavior in unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors and superfluids is established and described .",
    "this behavior corresponds to an isotropic ferromagnetic order in real systems but does not belong to any known universality class  @xcite and , hence , it could be of considerable experimental and theoretical interest . due to crystal and magnetic anisotropy ,",
    "a new type of fluctuation - driven first order phase transitions occur , as is shown in the present investigation .",
    "the novel fluctuation effects can be observed near finite and zero temperature ( `` quantum '' ) phase transitions  @xcite in wide class of ferromagnetic systems with unconventional ( spin - triplet ) superconductivity or superfluidity .",
    "the present study has been performed on the special example of intermetallic compounds uge@xmath0 and urhge , where the remarkable phenomenon of coexistence of itinerant ferromagnetism and unconventional spin - triplet superconductivity  @xcite has been observed  @xcite .",
    "for example , in uge@xmath0 , the coexistence phase occurs  @xcite at temperatures @xmath1  k and pressures @xmath2  gpa .",
    "a fragment of ( @xmath3 ) phase diagrams of itinerant ferromagnetic compounds  @xcite is sketched in fig .  1 , where the lines @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the paramagnetic(p)-to - ferromagnetic ( f ) and ferromagnetic - to - coexistence phase ( c ) transitions are very close to each other and intersect at very low temperature or terminate at the absolute zero ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "at low temperature , where the phase transition lines are close enough to each other , the interaction between the real magnetization vector @xmath7 and the complex order parameter vector of the spin - triplet cooper pairing  @xcite , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) can not be neglected  @xcite and , as shown here , this interaction produces new fluctuation phenomena .    both thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures ( @xmath10 ) and quantum fluctuations ( correlations ) near the @xmath11driven quantum phase transition at @xmath12 should be considered but at the first stage one may neglect the quantum effects  @xcite as irrelevant to finite temperature phase transitions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the present treatment of recently derived free energy functional  @xcite by the standard wilson - fisher renormalization group ( rg )  @xcite shows that unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors with isotropic magnetic order ( @xmath14 ) exhibit a quite particular multi - critical behavior for any @xmath15 , whereas the magnetic anisotropy ( @xmath16 ) generates fluctuation - driven first order transitions ( see sec .",

    "this leads to a considerable simplification of the rg treatment but on the other side specific symmetry properties of the relevant hamiltonian terms make the same rg treatment quite nontrivial ( sec .",

    "a particular feature of the present theoretical consideration is the breakdown of usual @xmath17-expansion in the one - loop approximation for rg equations @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the latter can not yield conclusive results and one is forced to derive the two - loop rg equations .",
    "the higher order of the theory restores the @xmath17-expansion in a modified form - expansion in non - integer powers ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath17 . in the framework of two - loop rg equations one obtains the above mentioned new critical behavior .",
    "this theoretical scenario looks quite similar to the breakdown of the usual @xmath17-series and the @xmath20-expansions in non - integer powers of @xmath21 , known for the first time from the theory of critical phenomena in anisotropic disordered systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the perturbation integrals are calculated for zero values of the external wave vectors , or , for zero values of certain hamiltonian parameters  @xcite . in such cases",
    "some of the integrals give equal contributions to the respective rg equations , but in other cases , for example , the investigation of the rg stability matrix , one should carefully take into account all the differences in the contributions of the same integrals .",
    "the calculation of elements of the linearized rg stability matrix is made through the exact dependence of the perturbation terms on the parameters of the hamiltonian and for this aim one needs to know the perturbation integrals in their initial general form . in all other aspects",

    "the treatment of spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors with magnetic anisotropies ( @xmath30 ) and/or crystal symmetry lower than the cubic one requires a somewhat different rg analysis .",

    "it is convenient to choose units , in which @xmath48 , and the upper cutoff for the magnitude @xmath49 of the wave vectors in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is equal to unity .",
    "some perturbation expansions within the rg investigation , in particular , those for isotropic systems ( @xmath50 ) can be performed with the help of known representation @xmath51 of the components @xmath52 of the respective vector product in eq .",

    "the simple dimensional analysis shows that the @xmath54term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) corresponds to a scaling factor @xmath55 and , hence , becomes relevant below the upper borderline dimension @xmath56 , whereas fourth order terms are scaled by a factor @xmath57 as in the usual @xmath58theory and are relevant below @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is a scaling number )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should perform the rg investigation in spatial dimensions @xmath61 , where the @xmath62term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) describes the only relevant fluctuation interaction . besides , the total fluctuation hamiltonian  @xcite contains off - diagonal terms of the form @xmath63 ; @xmath64 and/or @xmath65 . using a convenient loop expansion these terms can be completely integrated out from the partition function to show that they modify the parameters ( @xmath66 ) of the theory but they do not affect the structure of the model ( 1 ) .",
    "so , such terms change auxiliary quantities , for example , the coordinates of the rg fixed points ( fps ) but they do not affect the main rg results for the stability of the fps and the values of the critical exponents . here these off - diagonal gradient terms will be ignored .",
    "the mean - field investigation of the total hamiltonian shows that the @xmath62-term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) triggers the spin - triplet superconductivity ( @xmath67-trigger mechanism  @xcite ) .",
    "the fourth order terms , mentioned above , do not play such a crucial role .",
    "they merely stabilize the ordered phases , provide a correct shape of the ( @xmath3 ) phase domains for the specific crystal and magnetic symmetries . neglecting these terms",
    "one looses the opportunity to describe the equilibrium order @xmath68 and @xmath69 , but as shown above , the main fluctuation effects in a close vicinity of the phase transition points can be totally taken into account . here",
    "the attention is focussed on the behavior above the phase transition points where @xmath70 , and hence , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the simplest theory with upper critical dimension @xmath73 is that of a classic scalar field @xmath74 with @xmath75-interaction ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "quite more complex problem , where @xmath56 and an expansions in powers of @xmath76 are used arises in the theory of tricritical lifshitz points  @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the upper critical dimension @xmath77 is determined by a simple dimensional analysis in the so - called _ tree _ approximation  @xcite and/or by a check of singularities of the relevant perturbation integrals ( see sec .",
    "the two mentioned examples are from theories of a single ( vector or scalar ) field whereas the present theory ( 1 ) describes two fields . here",
    "the critical dimension @xmath78 is a result of the simple fact that the total power of fields in interaction ( @xmath62- ) term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is equal to three .",
    "thus one may suppose that some of the results in this paper could be applied to critical phenomena in improper ferroelectrics  @xcite , where interactions of two fields ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) of type @xmath81 also occur and the upper critical dimension is @xmath78 .",
    "the present investigation will demonstrate , however , that for such interaction of two fields and upper critical dimension @xmath56 , the rg analysis can lead to different results depending on the specific symmetry of the interaction term .",
    "the outcomes are two : a lack of stable fps and physical arguments leading to a prediction of first order phase transitions , or , the presence of a stable fp and , hence , a stable critical behavior .",
    "while the particular symmetry of interaction term provides a new stable fp and , hence , a new critical behavior for symmetry indices @xmath50 , one can not be certain that the same prediction can be made for ferroelectrics without a specific investigation .",
    "one may consider several cases : ( i ) isotropic systems , namely , cubic crystal symmetry and isotropic magnetic order , when all field components @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be different zero ( @xmath50 ) , ( ii ) anisotropic systems when the total number @xmath84 of field components is less than six .",
    "note that the case ( i ) is of major interest to real systems , where fluctuations of all field components are possible , despite the presence of crystal and magnetic anisotropy that nullifies some of the equilibrium field components .",
    "the functional integral over the fields @xmath85 in the partition function @xmath86 can be exactly calculated , for example , by the total summation of perturbation series in powers of the interaction parameter @xmath62 . in result ,",
    "one will obtain a new effective hamiltonian @xmath87 , which is a functional of a single field - @xmath23 . in this new @xmath23-theory the effects of the magnetic ( @xmath24- ) subsystem will be `` hidden '' in the vertex parameters of @xmath87 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can also be treated by rg but this task is beyond the scope of the present consideration .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) explicitly describes the fluctuations of the magnetization @xmath24 and this is the advantage with respect to @xmath87 .",

    "this means that the classical - to - quantum dimensional crossover at @xmath25 is given by @xmath344 and , hence , the system exhibits a simple mean field behavior for @xmath345 . just below the upper quantum critical dimension @xmath346 the relevant quantum effects at @xmath12",

    "this picture is confirmed by the analysis of singularities of relevant perturbation integrals .",
    "therefore , the quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath23 have a dominating role for spatial dimensions @xmath350 .",

    "one may try to take into account these quantum fluctuations by quite special approaches from the theory of disordered systems , where additional expansion parameters are used to ensure the marginality of the fluctuating modes at the same borderline dimension @xmath77 .",
    "it may be conjectured that the techniques , known from the theory of disordered systems with extended impurities , can not be straightforwardly applied to the present problem and , perhaps , a completely new approach should be introduced .",
    "for anisotropic systems , mentioned in sec .",
    "ii as case ( ii ) , the rg analysis leads to different results .",
    "the rg equations have no stable fp for dimensions @xmath199 and , therefore , one may conclude , quite reliably , that the @xmath372-interactions in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) induce fluctuation - driven first order phase transitions .",
    "the rg result for a lack of fp is not enough to make conclusions about the order of the phase transition , but in our case there are additional strong heuristic arguments as well as arguments from preceding mean - field investigations  @xcite .",
    "the heuristic argument is that the account of anisotropy effects often leads to change of the phase transition order from second order phase transition , when such effects are ignored to a first order phase transition , when the anisotropy is properly taken into account ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "besides , a recent mean field study shows that first order phase transitions and multi - critical points are likely to occur in both isotropic and anisotropic ferromagnetic superconductors for broad variations of the theory parameters @xmath373 .",
    "these non - rg arguments strongly support the present point of view that the lack of fp of rg equations for anisotropic systems can reliably be interpreted as indication for fluctuation - driven first order phase transitions in dimensions @xmath199 and , in particular , for @xmath374 .",
    "now , one has to prove that rg equations , corresponding to anisotropic systems do not exhibit stable fp for @xmath199 . the case ( ii ) of anisotropic systems , mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , contains several subclasses of systems .",
    "for example , one may have cubic crystal anisotropy with @xmath375 magnetic symmetry ( @xmath376 ) , i.e. , magnetic symmetry index @xmath377 , or , magnetic anisotropy of ising type : @xmath378 , i.e. , @xmath379 .",
    "another example is the tetragonal crystal anisotropy , where the symmetry index for the superconducting order is @xmath380 , i.e. , @xmath381 and the magnetic symmetry can be of two types : xy order symmetry ( @xmath382 ) and ising symmetry ( @xmath383 ) . these and other examples of anisotropic systems with total symmetry index @xmath384 can be considered separately to prove the lack of stable fp in each of the cases .",
    "we shall demonstrate the lack of stable fp for @xmath199 for uniaxial ( ising ) magnetic anisotropy @xmath378 and cubic crystal symmetry ( @xmath385 ) . in this case , the one loop rg equations have the form @xmath386,\\ ] ] @xmath387,\\ ] ] and @xmath388,\\ ] ] where the exponents @xmath389 , @xmath390 and @xmath316 correspond to the fields components @xmath391 , @xmath392 , and @xmath393 , respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath394 and @xmath395 are equal because the equations for them are the same @xmath396 from eq .",

    "( 71 ) , which describes the rg transformations of the two hamiltonian terms of type @xmath398 and @xmath399 , is the same .",
    "this fact ensures a self - consistency of rg transformation for the parameter @xmath181 . the one loop equation for the exponent @xmath316",
    "is given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) , provided the @xmath177-term in the r.h.s .",
    "of this equation is ignored .",
    "thus one finds that @xmath400 as is in isotropic systems .",
    "it should be emphasized that the perturbation series does not give self energy contributions to the @xmath401-term .",
    "that is why the rg transformation is performed after a simple procedure of integration out of this field in the functional integral for the system partition function .",
    "the integration is exact as the respective integral is gaussian .",
    "the effect is an irrelevant contribution to the system free energy .",
    "thus , the field component @xmath402 is redundant in this consideration and does not participate in the rg transformation . on the other hand , if one keeps the field component @xmath23 in this rg transformation and considers it at the same footing as the other fields @xmath403 the resulting rg transformation of the term @xmath404 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) will produce a transformation for the parameter @xmath181 , @xmath405 , which contradicts to the relation ( 71 ) .",
    "hopefully , this is not the right way of rg treatment and here its discussion should be understood only as a note of caution .    using eq .",
    "( 73 ) , eq .",
    "( 27 ) for the integral @xmath188 to zeroth order in @xmath17 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 , as well as the above results for the exponents @xmath216 and @xmath406 , one can easily obtain fps .",
    "the gfp ( @xmath407 ) exists and is stable for @xmath408 .",
    "the second fp is given by @xmath409 , which means that this fp is unphysical for @xmath410 , i.e. , for dimensions @xmath200 .",

    "the result can not be changed in the next orders of the loop expansion .",
    "the rg analysis , performed above , is valid also for systems with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy ( @xmath414 ) and tetragonal crystal symmetry , @xmath415 .",
    "the only difference is that in these systems the redundant field component @xmath402 is equal to zero and one does not need to perform a functional integration over redundant fields .    for tetragonal symmetry and bi - axial ( xy ) magnetic anisotropy @xmath416 , the @xmath54term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is equal to zero and , hence , eq .  ( 1 ) describes a simple gaussian fluctuations . in this case",
    "one must consider the fluctuation effects coming from the fourth order terms in the general effective hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "these terms may lead to the appearance of familiar types of fps , which describe bicritical and tertracritical points of phase transitions ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "imply that the appearance of stable fp in such systems is quite unlikely .",
    "the common difference in the results from one loop rg equations for isotropic and anisotropic unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors is in number factors and scaling exponents of type @xmath418 in the respective rg equations .",

    "iii.e , the satisfactory consideration of the quantum fluctuations of both fields @xmath24 and @xmath23 requires a new rg approach , in which one should either consider the difference @xmath419 as an auxiliary small parameter or invent a completely new theoretical scheme of description .",

    "the present author has not been able to give a comprehensive solution of the problem and , hence , the discussion of quantum effects presented in sec .",

    "systems with isotropic magnetic order are needed for an experimental test of the newly described multicritical behavior .",
