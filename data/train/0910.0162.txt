    "a simple way to describe the polarization state of light , which has been known for many years in optics , is by the stokes vector , which is depicted as a point on the so - called poincar sphere @xcite .",
    "the stokes vector , for instance , is a particularly convenient tool to describe the change of the polarization state of light transmitted through anisotropic optical media @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the stokes vector in a medium with zero polarization dependent loss ( pdl ) has a torque form @xcite .",
    "this fact has been used recently to draw analogies between the motion of the stokes vector and a spin-@xmath0 particle in nuclear magnetic resonance and an optically driven two - state atom in quantum optics , both described by the schrdinger equation @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a technique for controlled robust conversion of the polarization of light transmitted through optically anisotropic media with no pdl .",
    "the technique is analogous to stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) in quantum optics @xcite and hence enjoys the same advantages as stirap in terms of efficiency and robustness .    for any traditional polarization devices the rotary power ( the phase delay between the _ fast _ and _ slow _ eigenpolarizations ) scales in proportion to the frequency of the light and thus such devices are frequency dependent : a half - wave plate is working for exactly one single frequency . on the contrary ,",
    "the adiabatic polarization conversion proposed here is _",
    "frequency independent _ : any input polarization will be transformed to the same output polarization state regardless of the wavelength .",
    "it acts intrinsically as a broadband device limited only by the absorptive characteristics of the device instead of its birefringence bandwidth .",
    "moreover , the proposed technique is robust against variations in the _ length _ of the device , in the same fashion as quantum - optical stirap is robust against variations in the pulse duration .",
    "we first consider a plane electromagnetic wave traveling through a dielectric medium in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "the medium is anisotropic and with no pdl , therefore the polarization evolution is given with the following torque equation for the stokes vector @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the distance along the propagation direction , and @xmath3 $ ] is the stokes polarization vector shown in fig .",
    "[ poinacare sphere ] .",
    "every stokes polarization vector corresponds to a point on the poincar sphere and vice versa .",
    "the right circular polarization is represented by the north pole , the left circular polarization by the south pole , the linear polarizations by points in the equatorial plane , and the elliptical polarization by the points between the poles and the equatorial plane .",
    "@xmath4 $ ] is the birefringence vector of the medium : the direction of @xmath5 is given by the _",
    "eigenpolarization and its length @xmath6 corresponds to the rotary power .",
    "when one of the components of the vector @xmath5 is zero , then eq . is mathematically equivalent to the schrdinger equation for a coherently driven three - state quantum @xmath7 system on exact resonances with the carrier frequencies of the external fields .",
    "this is readily seen by examining the time - dependent schrdinger equation , which in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) reads @xmath8 here @xmath9 is a column vector of the probability amplitudes @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) of the three states @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a @xmath16 hamiltonian matrix @xcite , @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eqn - w}\\]]we have here assumed both two - photon and single - photon resonances .",
    "the two slowly varying rabi frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 parameterize the strengths of each of the two fields ; they are proportional to the dipole transition moments @xmath20 and to the electric - field amplitudes @xmath21 : @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; hence each of them varies as the square root of the corresponding intensity .",
    "the quantum evolution associated with the @xmath24 system is easily understood with the use of adiabatic states , i.e. the three instantaneous eigenstates @xmath25 of the rwa hamiltonian .",
    "the adiabatic state @xmath26 corresponding to a zero eigenvalue is particularly noteworthy , because it has no component of state @xmath13 , @xmath27 this state therefore does not lead to fluorescence and is known as a _ dark _ state @xcite . if the motion is _ adiabatic _",
    "@xcite , and if the state vector @xmath28 is initially aligned with the adiabatic state @xmath26 , then the state vector remains aligned with @xmath26 throughout the evolution .",
    "this occurs if the pulses are ordered counterintuitively , @xmath19 before @xmath18 : then the composition of the dark state @xmath29 will progress from initial alignment with @xmath12 to final alignment with @xmath14 .",
    "hence in the adiabatic regime the complete population will be transferred adiabatically from state @xmath12 to state @xmath14 .",
    "this important feature of complete transfer under full control has made stirap a widespread preparation technique for experiments relying on precise state control @xcite .",
    "the formalism can be applied to other systems , including classical ones @xcite , by making use of the similarity of the respective equations to eqs .   and .",
    "returning to light polarization , two special cases are particularly interesting .    _ * case a : * _ @xmath30 . with the redefinition of variables @xmath31",
    ", the schrdinger equation turns into the form , if we map the time dependance into the coordinate dependance . by using this analogy",
    "we can write down a superposition @xmath32 of the polarization components @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the stokes vector , which corresponds to the _ dark _ state @xmath26 , eq .  :",
    "@xmath35    when @xmath36 precedes @xmath37 the polarization superposition has the following asymptotic values @xmath38 thus if initially the light is linearly polarized in horizontal direction , @xmath39 , we end up with a linearly polarized light rotated by @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ poinacare sphere ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the process is reversible ; hence if we start with a linear polarization rotated by @xmath40 and apply a reverse field order ( @xmath37 preceding @xmath36 ) this will lead to reversal of the direction of motion and we will end up with a linear polarization in a horizontal direction .",
    "following quantum - optical stirap , we can write down the condition for adiabatic evolution as @xcite @xmath42 for example , for adiabatic evolution it suffices to have @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the thickness of the medium and the length of the birefringence vector is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the wavelength of the light , @xmath47 is the difference between the refractive indices for ordinary and extraordinary rays",
    ". then the adiabatic condition reads @xmath48the last condition shows that the process is robust against variation in the parameters , for example , the wavelength @xmath49 and the propagation length @xmath44 .",
    "this condition is readily fulfilled , by orders of magnitude , in many birefringent materials .    _",
    "* case b : * _ @xmath50 . following a similar argumentation as for _",
    "* case a * _ and interchanging the stokes vector components @xmath33 and @xmath51 we can write down a `` dark '' superposition @xmath32 of the polarization components @xmath33 and @xmath51 of the stokes vector , @xmath52 if initially the light is linearly polarized , @xmath39 , then by arranging @xmath36 to precede @xmath53 , we end up with a right circular polarization , @xmath54 , as depicted by the north pole on the poincar sphere in fig .",
    "[ poinacare sphere ] ( b ) , because the polarization superposition has the asymptotic values @xmath55 the process is again reversible : starting with a right circular polarization , and applying @xmath53 before @xmath36 we end up with a linear polarization .",

    "_ @xcite . here",
    "this effect emerges as a special case of our general adiabatic frame of stirap analogy .    the adiabatic polarization conversion could be demonstrated with a single - mode fiber , which exhibits both stress - induced linear birefringence and circular birefringence ( either by the faraday effect or by a torsion of the fiber ) @xcite .",
    "possible implementations are depicted in figs .",
    "[ torsion ] ( for case a ) and [ faraday rotation ] ( for case b ) .",
    "the technique proposed here is not limited to linear - linear or circular - linear conversions , but it is also applicable for _ arbitrary _ transformations of light polarization .",
    "for example the conversion between right circular and left circular polarization is analogous to adiabatic passage via a level crossing @xcite . to this end , we first start up with @xmath53 , then we activate @xmath36 , then let @xmath53 change sign while @xmath36 is having its maximal value , and then gradually make @xmath53 to fade away",
    ".    we can also change the polarization from linear to elliptical if we first begin with @xmath36 , then we activate @xmath53 , and then let @xmath36 and @xmath53 _ simultaneously _ fade away [ cf .",
    "; this sequence is known in quantum optics as fractional stirap @xcite .",
    "as an example of polarization conversion we present here an exact analytic solution to the stokes polarization equation for the slowly varying birefringence components given by trigonometric functions :    @xmath56    [ trigonometric functions ]    we assume that initially the stokes vector is @xmath57 , i.e. the polarization is right circular .",
    "then the solution for the stokes vector components as a function of @xmath1 reads    @xmath58    where @xmath59 .",
    "the adiabatic evolution takes place when @xmath60 ;    for @xmath61 ( quarter period ) we have    @xmath62    this case exemplifies the conversion between circular and linear polarization via stirap - like adiabatic process , as illustrated in fig .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that the powerful technique of stirap , which is well - known in quantum optics , has an analogue in the evolution of light polarization described by the equation for the stokes vector .",
    "the factor that enables this analogy is the equivalence of the schrdinger equation for a resonant three - state @xmath24 system , to the torque equation for the stokes vector .",
