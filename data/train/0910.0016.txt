    "quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in many areas of quantum information science @xcite , including , among others , quantum cryptography and secure quantum key distribution @xcite , and quantum communication @xcite . for this reason",
    ", much work has been dedicated to single out ways to produce useful entanglement for efficient and robust implementation of quantum information tasks . the most natural way to create",
    "entanglement between two or more constituents of a quantum information device appears to be by means of direct interactions because , intuitively , large amounts of entanglement should be associated to the presence of strong quantum correlations .",
    "however , from a general quantum informatic perspective , an even more desirable goal is to envisage ways to produce large amounts of entanglement shared between distant and generally not directly interacting constituents .",
    "along the way to accomplish this task , a first step has been realized by introducing the concept of localizable entanglement @xcite , namely the rate of entanglement that can be concentrated on a pair of arbitrarily distant constituents by performing optimal local measurements onto the remainder of the system .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the ground state of some spin models with finite correlation length defined on one - dimensional chains with open ends can support large values of the end - to - end entanglement between the initial and final points of the chain , insensitive or only very weakly sensitive to the size of the system@xcite .",
    "this type of entanglement has thus been dubbed long - distance entanglement ( lde ) . in this approach ,",
    "the guiding principle is to look for systems whose gs can support _ intrinsically _ large amounts of ( long - distance ) entanglement , even at moderately high temperatures and in the presence of bulk imperfections , without the need for performing operations and measurements or for continuous dynamical controls and adjustments of the couplings . clearly , the property of lde would be very appealing in the quest to design quantum information devices , that perform tasks efficiently and at the same time are sufficiently robust against decoherence , based on ( properly engineered ) many - body systems of condensed matter that could possibly be realized with currently available technologies , or technologies that may be in view in the near future .",
    "the scope of the present work is to investigate various theoretical aspects of the phenomenon of lde in quantum many - body physics , to introduce possible concrete experimental implementations with currently available many - body systems of atomic physics and quantum optics , and to discuss simple schemes of lde - based efficient and robust quantum communication .",
    "concerning the theoretical modeling , here and in the following we will consider as paradigmatic test - beds some very simple isotropic quantum spin models on open chains with @xmath0-type interactions of site - dependent strength .",
    "for suitable choices of the sets of site - dependent couplings , these models can show large values of the entanglement shared by the end spins of the chain @xcite . notwithstanding their apparent simplicity , they are a very powerful and useful tool in order to investigate , identify , classify , and summarize the different possible types of lde , and the properties associated to different patterns of site - dependent interaction strengths .",
    "moreover , these different classes of @xmath0 quantum spin models with site - dependent interaction couplings turn out to be very well suited to assess the experimentally relevant problem of the vanishing of the energy gap as a function of the size of the system , and to identify , unambiguously , the optimal range of parameters compatible with the largest achievable value of lde at fixed values of the temperature and of the length of the chain .    after establishing the general theoretical framework",
    ", we will analyze some possible realizations based on two many - body systems of current experimental interest and that are moreover evolving and being developed at a fast pace , namely systems of ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattices @xcite and arrays of coupled cavities @xcite .",
    "these two systems share some common features .",
    "they can be seen as ensembles of local structures that interact with each other via the exchange of bosonic particles , atoms in the case of optical lattices , and photons in the case of coupled cavities .",
    "both systems allow to simulate quantum spin models by effectively reducing the dimension of the local state space , and by realizing spin - spin interactions via the inter - site hopping amplitudes . however , while the hopping amplitude in an array of coupled optical microcavities can be tuned at will , at least in principle , either by adjusting the inter - cavity overlaps and/or by tuning the cavities fundamental physical parameters ( rabi couplings , quality factors , etc . ) of every single cavity ( single - site addressing ) , this task appears to be much more challenging in optical lattices , for which the inter - site properties are indissolubly woven with the frequency of the external laser potentials , and hence site - dependent interactions between the effective spins can be engineered either by introducing atomic impurities and/or by designing super - lattice structures .",
    "we will discuss merits and disadvantages of both types of systems in the quest for the experimental demonstration of lde and its use in the realization of efficient , robust , and high - fidelity quantum information tasks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the general @xmath0 spin chain hamiltonian with arbitrary site - dependent couplings and review the methods to determine its spectrum , its ground - state properties , and the end - to - end concurrence . in section iii",
    "we investigate the properties of lde for different patterns of site - dependent interaction couplings , singling out two different general situations : patterns that allow for perfect lde , namely such that the end - to - end entanglement remains finite in the limit of diverging size of the system , and quasi - lde ( or imperfect lde ) , i.e. such that the end - to - end entanglement vanishes with a very slow power - law decay as the length of the chain increases . in section",
    "iv we discuss how to realize or , better , how to simulate the models analyzed in section iii with ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms loaded in optical lattices . in the literature there exist several proposals to implement lde - free spin models , either with uniform @xcite or random @xcite spin - spin couplings , using optical lattices in various settings . here",
    "we show how , using either suitably engineered super - lattice structures or exploiting the presence of edge impurities in lattices with single periodicity , it is possible to realize models endowed with nonvanishing lde in the ground state . in section v we investigate how to realize spin models supporting lde by the use of suitable array structures of coupled cavities .",
    "in fact , these systems are being intensively studied in relation to their ability to realize / simulate collective phenomena typical of strongly correlated systems of condensed matter @xcite . concerning the simulation of spin models ,",
    "we show how , at least in principle , this type of system allows to simulate straightforwardly @xmath0 models with arbitrary patterns of site - dependent couplings and different types of lde . in both sections numerical estimates of the end - to - end entanglement in the actual physical systems are thoroughly compared with the results obtained in the simulated spin model systems . in section",
    "vi we discuss the implementation of an lde - based scheme of long - distance quantum teleportation exploiting open linear arrays of coupled cavities .",
    "in particular , we show that this scheme allows for high - fidelity teleportation even at moderately high temperatures and in the presence of noise .",
    "finally , in the conclusions we summarize our findings and discuss some outlooks on possible future developments along this line of research .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , in this section we discuss the properties of @xmath0 quantum spin-@xmath1 models defined on one - dimensional lattices with open ends , with specific patterns of nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "such models are all special instances of the general @xmath0 hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the interaction strength between spins at nearest neighboring sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the spin-@xmath1 operator defined at site @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is the total number of sites ( spins ) or , equivalently , the length of the chain .",
    "the spectrum of this hamiltonian can be determined exactly by a straightforward generalization of the methods first discussed by lieb , schultz , and mattis @xcite .",
    "the first step in the procedure is to perform a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianagenerica ] ) is mapped in the free fermion hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the vector of the @xmath7 fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operators , one for each site of the lattice , and the adjacency matrix @xmath13 reads @xmath14 given the gs of the system , we are interested in the evaluation of the end - to - end entanglement in the reduced two - qubit state between the first spin at site 1 and the last spin at site @xmath7 .",
    "one thus needs to determine the spin - spin concurrence ( entanglement of formation ) between the end points of the chain .",
    "this quantity can be computed exactly for any two - qubit state ( pure or mixed ) , thanks to the celebrated wootters formula @xcite , and the task is left to obtain its explicit expression in the reduced state of the two end - point spins . to this purpose",
    ", we need to calculate explicitly all the possible forms of two - point correlations in the gs .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianagenerica ] ) is symmetric under rotations of the spins around the @xmath15-axis , so that the only nonvanishing correlations are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the absence of external magnetic fields , @xmath19-rotations around the @xmath20 and @xmath21 axes",
    "are symmetries of the model , which additionally implies @xmath22 at every site .",
    "thanks to the aforementioned symmetries , the two - point reduced density matrix @xmath23 , obtained by tracing the ground - state density matrix of the entire system over all spins except the ones at sites @xmath24 , has the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the pauli matrices and @xmath27 is the gs average at temperature @xmath28 , or the thermal one at finite temperature @xmath29 with respect to the gibbs state @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the case in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the two end points of the chain . in this instance",
    ", we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total number operator . applying wick s theorem and taking into account that @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath36 setting @xmath37 we see that the end - to - end reduced density matrix depends uniquely on this parameter . for reduced states of the form ( [ reduceddensity ] ) the end to end concurrence @xmath38",
    "is readily computed @xcite . in our case , we have @xmath39 the concurrence is thus nonvanishing for @xmath40 , and it reaches the maximum value @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "it is natural to expect that the existence of a strong quantum correlation between the two end spins of the chain can be conveniently exploited for performing tasks in quantum information , in particular considering teleportation schemes . in the standard quantum teleportation protocol ,",
    "two parties a and b share a maximally entangled state ( bell state ) .",
    "party a holds also a third qubit , whose unknown state is to be teleported . if the two end points of our @xmath0 chain share a highly entangled state , that in some limit may even be asymptotically close to a bell state , they can be identified as the two parties , sender and receiver , for a long - distance , high - fidelity teleportation protocol .",
    "the efficiency of a quantum channel in teleporting an unknown state is quantified by the fidelity @xmath43 between the output and the input states , averaged over all input realizations .",
    "the fidelity depends on the actual properties of the entangled resource @xmath44 ( cfr .",
    "( [ reduceddensity ] ) ) shared by the end spins of the chain . in fact , it has been demonstrated that the optimal fidelity depends only on the `` fully entangled fraction '' @xmath45 , according to the formula @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "having reviewed the basic definitions and mathematical tools needed to analyze the end - to - end entanglement properties in @xmath0 spin chains with arbitrary site - dependent interaction strengths , we need to look for those sets of couplings that allow for large values of lde , possibly robust against thermal decoherence and bulk imperfections .",
    "the required entanglement properties .",
    "the basic idea for concentrating a large amount of entanglement on the two end spins of the chain is inspired by the observation that for some frustration - free systems , like the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model @xcite , and some @xmath0-type models @xcite , the total energy is minimized by states tending to form a global singlet .",
    "this fact , together with the property of monogamy for bipartite entanglement @xcite , is the primary cause for the phenomenon of lde .",
    "namely , if one selects a set of interaction couplings in the hamiltonian eq.([hamiltonianagenerica ] ) that are such to forbid the end spins to entangle with any other constituents , then , by monogamy , strong quantum correlations will develop between them .      in analogy with the case of the dimerized antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , that was the system in which the phenomenon of lde was first discovered @xcite ,",
    "we begin by reviewing the properties of the @xmath0 spin chain with bonds of alternating strengths , i.e. a model in which each weak bond ( @xmath60 , with @xmath61 ) between neighboring spins at sites is followed by a much stronger one ( @xmath62 ) between the successive pair of neighboring spins .",
    "this model has been introduced and investigated in ref .",
    "if the chain is formed of an even number of sites and the two end points are coupled to their nearest neighbors with a weak bond , this model fulfills exactly the requirements needed in order to establish perfect lde between the end spins of the chain .",
    "namely , any spin in the chain but the end ones is subject to a weak ( left ) interaction and to a strong ( right ) interaction .",
    "hence , every spin in the bulk tends to be maximally entangled with its strongly interacting neighbor .",
    "each of the two end spins is subject only to a weak bond interaction , and is therefore excluded from the arrangement in pairs of nearest - neighbor singlets due to the monogamy property of bipartite entanglement @xcite . furthermore , because the gs of the model tends to be a collection of singlets , the two end spin spins are effectively coupled and develop a nonvanishing lde mediated by the remainder of the chain , notwithstanding the fact that they do not interact directly in any way .    the above qualitative reasoning can be made precise and quantitative .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath0 spin model with alternating weak and strong interactions is @xmath63\\left(s_{i}^{x}s_{i+1}^{x } + s_{i}^{y}s_{i+1}^{y}\\right ) \\ ; . \\label{ldehamiltonian}\\ ] ] following the approach described in the previous section , one can determine the end - to - end concurrence for different values of @xmath64 and different lengths of the chain @xcite , as shown in fig .",

    "the dimers , in turn , are very weakly coupled to each other .",

    "in conclusion , we have introduced some classes of quantum spin models defined on open 1-d lattices that are characterized by non - perturbative gss with nonvanishing lde or qlde . in particular ,",
    "end - to - end qlde is found to be strongly resilient to thermal decoherence and can be efficiently achieved with a minimal set of local actions on the end- and near - end couplings in linear open ccas .",
    "we have showed that qlde - based ccas allow for a simple quasi - deterministic protocol of long - distance , high - fidelity quantum teleportation that yields a high rate of success without direct bell measurements and projections over bell states . in detail , we have studied models of @xmath0 quantum spin chains with nearest - neighbor interactions , discussing two types of spatial patterns of the coupling strengths . in the case of chains with bonds of alternating strengths , we have shown that the exact gs possesses a nonvanishing lde between the end spins of the chain , independently of the size of the system and asymptotically close to unity ( maximal entanglement ) in the limit of exact dimerization .",
    "this system is therefore perfectly suited for _ bona fide _ long - distance quantum teleportation with ideal fidelity at zero temperature .",
    "however , the limiting maximal values of the fidelity are obtained at the cost of introducing an energy gap above the gs that vanishes exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "therefore , this model is _ de facto _",
    "useless for efficient quantum teleportation at finite temperature .",
    "we have then discussed another class of @xmath0 open spin chains with uniform bulk interactions and small end bonds . in this case , we have shown that for sufficiently small values of the end couplings , the gs of the system possesses a sizeable qlde between the end spins of the chain , that at fixed size of the system is asymptotically close to unity ( maximal entanglement ) in the limit of vanishingly small end bonds . however , qlde decreases , albeit slowly , as the size of the system is increased .",
    "models of qlde can be improved further by introducing strong near - end bonds that enhance the value of the end - to - end entanglement ( @xmath64@xmath101 model ) .",
    "an interesting feature of qlde models is that the energy gap above the gs vanishes only algebraically , as the first power of the inverse of the size of the system .",
    "therefore , in principle , spin chains endowed with the qlde property can be exploited as quantum channel for teleportation with nonclassical fidelity at finite temperature .",
    "a relevant issue concerned the behavior of these systems in the presence of disorder .",
    "this question is important especially in view of possible experimental implementations in which the couplings can be engineered only within a certain accuracy . since naturally",
    "the effect of disorder is that of localizing eigenstates , we expected lde to be more robust than qlde against disorder .",
    "in fact , in the lde scenario the states responsible for the end - to - end entanglement is already localized at the borders whereas localization is only approximate in the qlde case .",
    "this conjecture has in fact been confirmed by thorough exact numerical samplings , that also show that the relative weight of imperfections that can be tolerated by the systems , maintaining large and useful values of lde and qlde , is rather high , up to @xmath243 , and more .",
    "moreover , for about always half of the spatial patterns and values of the couplings , disorder can even enhance the end - to - end entanglement .",
    "it is at the moment unclear how this picture extends to finite temperature .",
    "another interesting open problem worth further study is to assess the existence and the possible location of a crossover between perfect lde and _ prima facie _ qlde .    demonstrating experimentally ( q)lde and ( q)lde - based efficient long - distance teleportation and state transfer will be a first crucial preliminary test in order to proceed with integrated devices of quantum information science , combining atom - optical systems such as optical lattices or systems of trapped ions with solid - state based systems , such as those of circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics .",
