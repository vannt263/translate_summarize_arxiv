    "spacetime singularities are one of the most problematic features of general relativity .",
    "physics breaks down there and unpredictability appears to be unavoidable . among all the predictions of general relativity , black holes ( bhs )",
    "are usually considered one of the most fascinating objects which populate our universe , and are frequently used to test different attempts to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics . after the singularity theorems by hawking and penrose @xcite ( an excellent overview of these theorems and subsequent extensions can be found in @xcite ) , bhs are known to have a singularity inside them .    these theorems can be circumvented and regular bhs , that is , solutions of einstein equations that have horizons but are regular everywhere , can be constructed . in particular , charged regular bh solutions",
    "exist in the framework of einstein  nonlinear electrodynamics ( nled ) theory .",
    "the interest in these theories is twofold .",
    "first , quantum corrections to maxwell theory can be described by means of non  linear effective lagrangians that define nleds as , for example , the euler  heisenberg lagrangian @xcite , which is effectively described by born  infeld ( bi ) theory @xcite .",
    "even more , higher order corrections give place to a sequence of effective lagrangians which are polynomials in the field invariants @xcite . and",
    "second , in case of dealing with open bosonic strings , the resulting tree  level effective lagrangian is shown to coincide with the bi lagrangian @xcite .",
    "these nled theories , when coupled to gravity , give place to very interesting phenomena as , for instance , the appereance of generalized reissner ",
    "nordstrm geometries in the form of bi  like solutions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , exact regular bh geometries in the presence of nled were obtained in @xcite . in particular , the ayn  beato and garca solution @xcite , further discussed in @xcite , extended the preliminary attempt of bardeen @xcite to obtain regular bh geometries .",
    "moreover , bhs with the euler  heisenberg effective lagrangian as a source term were examined in @xcite , and a similar type of solutions with lagrangian densities that are powers of maxwell s lagrangian were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the plausibility of these solutions is usually checked with the help of energy conditions .",
    "in fact , if a bh is regular , the strong enery condition is violated somewhere inside the horizon @xcite but the weak or dominant energy conditions could be satisfied everywhere @xcite . moreover , as pointed out in @xcite , regular bhs that satisfy the weak energy condition ( wec ) and their energy ",
    "momentum tensor is such that @xmath0 have a de sitter behaviour at @xmath1 .",
    "regular bh solutions possessing this symmetry , some of them satisfying the wec and with an asymptotically reissner ",
    "nrdstrom behaviour , have been constructed in the framework of einstein  nleds @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "several black hole metrics corresponding to nonlinearly charged black holes which were shown to be consistent with a logarithmic correction to the bekenstein  hawking entropy formula were constructed .",
    "the main drawback of this work was that the wec was shown to be perturbatively violated at order @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , as stated in @xcite , we think that it would be interesting to investigate whether or not is possible to obtain effective regular bh geometries with reproduce the logarithmic correction without violating this energy condition .    in this work",
    "we tackle this problem and construct a new and very simple static and spherically symmetric regular bh solution , obtained within einstein ",
    "nled theory .",
    "our result will be based on a useful formula relating the electric field , which will be imposed to be coulomb  like , with the curvature invariants @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this bh will be shown to be reissner ",
    "nrdstrom  like at infinity . as stated before",
    ", the wec will be shown to be satisfied everywhere . moreover , after a careful analysis of the horizons , the entropy and heat capacity will reveal that our model realizes some quantum gravity predictions which add a logarithmic correction to the bh entropy and which give place to a remnant .",
    "finally , some conclusions are established regarding a possible realization of a quadratic generalized uncertainty principle by nled .",
    "in geometrized units , einstein s equations ( @xmath5 ) read @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy ",
    "momentum tensor .",
    "let us form the following curvature invariants : @xmath8 as pointed out in @xcite in the four dimensional case , the non  weyl part of the curvature determined by the matter content can be separated by showing that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the trace of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor and @xmath11 is the dimension of the spacetime .    for simplicity",
    "let us take spherically symmetric and static solutions given by ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 for the matter content we choose certain nled . assuming that the corresponding lagrangian only depends on one of the two field invariants , a particular choice for an energy ",

    "( [ max ] ) and ( [ electric ] ) , the following ordinary differential equation for @xmath30 can be derived : @xmath31 in the maxwell case ( @xmath32 ) , the solutions are given by @xmath33 . the solution with positive sign coincides with the reissner ",
    "nrdstrom one if @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( we think that this is a simple way of obtaining this well known solution ) .",
    "the negative sign corresponds to the quasicharged einstein ",
    "rosen bridge @xcite , which is usually assumed to be an _ ad hoc _ modification of the theory corresponding to a negative electromagnetic energy density .",
    "this is a clear example of how the einstein equations do not say anything about energy conditions , which have to be imposed apart from the dynamics .",
    "+   + in the general case , taking @xmath36 , we get    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are arbitrary constants .",
    "it can be seen that only the ( first ) positive sign choice gives place to the correct @xmath40 case . within this choice , eq .",
    "( [ long ] ) simplifies to    @xmath41    therefore , if a nled model depending on @xmath42 is given , then eq . ( [ long ] ) can be used to calculate the corresponding geometry , which solves einstein equations .",
    "we note that the opposite way is usually considered when regular bh solutions are looked for .",
    "that is , one starts from certain metric and tries to look for some nled model such that the coupled einstein ",
    "non  linear theory is satisfied .",
    "this underlying nled theory can be obtained using the @xmath43 framework @xcite , which is somehow dual to the @xmath44 framework . after introducing the tensor @xmath45 together with its invariant @xmath46 ,",
    "one considers the hamiltonian  like quantity @xmath47 as a function of @xmath43 , which specifies the theory .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian can be written as a function of @xmath43 as @xmath48 finally , by reformulating the coupled einstein ",
    "nled equations in terms of @xmath43 , @xmath49 is shown to be given by @xcite @xmath50 where the mass function @xmath51 is such that @xmath52 .",
    "let us assume a nled theory such that , when dealing only whith static and spherically symmetric sources , the corresponding electric field is regular everywhere .",
    "let us consider a simple ansatz for the electric field , which we express as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . from this choice it is clear that @xmath56 .",

    "after considering the schwarzschild  de sitter metric , we get that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 and we can write    @xmath70    which is of the form of eq .",

    "we have    @xmath83    a couple of comments are in order here .",
    "first of all , let us note that maxwell s theory , @xmath84 , is recovered for small fields .",
    "in addition , a quadratic bi  like term appears ( fifth term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ ourh ] ) ) .",
    "this quadratic term is easy to interpret in light of the cutoff field which is an essential ingredient of bi  theory .",
    "therefore , the difficulty of interpreting this nled theory can be adscribed to the other terms which appear in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ ourh ] ) . in spite of this ,",
    "let us note that similar terms have appeared since the discovery of the first exact regular bh solution by ayn  beato and garca @xcite .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian function presented in ref .",
    "@xcite can be expanded for weak fields to give    @xmath85    which except for some constants coincide with our eq .",
    "( [ ourh ] ) .    in spite of some drawback related with the interpretation of some terms which appear in eq .",
    "( [ ourh ] ) , the nled we are considering has a nice feature because the wec is satisfied .",
    "in particular , with the help of @xmath51 , this wec can be expressed as @xcite @xmath86 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , using eq .",
    "( [ theeq ] ) whith @xmath87 we get @xmath88 + and , therefore , the wec is satisfied everywhere ( as commented in the introduction , given the regularity of the bh solution , the strong enery condition is violated somewhere inside the horizon @xcite .",
    "however , we left this calculation to the interested reader because we think it does not contribute to the subsequent discussion ) .",
    "note that this agrees with the existence of the de sitter behaviour @xcite for the metric function when @xmath1 , given by eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) .",
    "in order to study the existence of event horizons in this geometry we have to find the values of @xmath77 where @xmath89 - i.e : the set of values of @xmath77 for which @xmath90 .",
    "hereafter , only the case @xmath91 will be considered .",
    "the @xmath92 function appearing in eq .",
    "( [ theeq ] ) can be written as @xmath93 where we have defined the auxiliary function @xmath94 as @xmath95 clearly the horizons are located at @xmath96 . however , in order to have a physically meaningful model , we are interested in the case of three real roots .",
    "this can be achieved by forming the discriminant from the corresponding polynomial equation and then analysing when it is negative @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are certain functions of the mass @xmath76 and charge @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "when solving for small values of @xmath100 and @xmath76 , the previous condition has a graphic solution given by the shaded region of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .     +    however , we note that the linear tendency is maintained for bigger values both of @xmath76 and @xmath100 .    as fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) suggests , there exists a region where the polynomial ( [ p(r ) ] ) has three real roots . from this general case of three real roots we are interested in the particular case of two positive and one negative as it would be desirable to resemble the reissner - nrdstrom case and to avoid degeneracies in the horizons . for this particular case the actual limit for the mass of the bh would be @xmath101 to get a glimpse of what is happening with this new limit it suffices to use the following properties for the roots of a cubic equation @xcite . if @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the roots of an arbitrary cubic equation , then + @xmath104 where in our specific case : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath108 , which is the limit with no pathologies in the sign and existence of the three different roots , then it is straightforward to show that , at first order in @xmath100 , @xmath109 which is a good symptom of our theory since this case would describe a schwarzschild bh with a charge perturbing it . finally , if we use again the relations given by eq .",
    "( [ relations ] ) , this time relaxing the condition to @xmath110 but still having @xmath111 , then the error made to the other roots @xmath112 and @xmath113 is about @xmath114 which is a very small number . from this we conclude that the limit @xmath115 has a solid footing .    to summarize ,",
    "in this discussion we have shown that for any combination of @xmath116 , @xmath94 has two real positive roots which are very close to the horizons of a perturbed schwarzschild bh , i.e : @xmath117 and @xmath118 . the perturbation is performed by the charge @xmath100 and it has the additional and very important feature of regularising the geometry .    therefore , following the previous reasoning , in the next section we are going to work in the regime @xmath108 , which guarantees two horizons and no pathologies since it fulfills the condition given by eq .",
    "( [ secondr ] ) .",
    "we also note that this regime avoids the case of having a naked singularity that would defy the penrose cosmic censorship conjecture , which is believed to be true @xcite . within this limit ,",
    "the two horizons of the regular bh , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are given by @xmath121 + \\mathcal{o } \\left(\\frac{q}{2m}\\right)^3\\nonumber \\\\",

    "given the expressions for the horizons as expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ horizons ] ) , in this section a discussion of the thermodynamics of this regular bh will be presented .    as in the the reissner - nordstrm case ,",
    "the surface gravity is given by @xmath123 therefore , the temperature is readily obtained using the equation @xmath124 .",
    "we obtain @xmath125 and , therefore , using the second principle in the form , @xmath126 , the entropy of the bh takes the form @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the schwarzschild bh area and @xmath129 is a constant .",
    "in addition , an interesting result obtained from this particular solution is the emergence of a remnant mass , which can be obtained by calculating the heat capacity , defined as @xmath130 .",
    "after some calculations we get @xmath131 + therefore , as the bh evaporation stops when @xmath132 , a remnant mass can be obtained . from eq .",
    "( [ hc ] ) , this mass is shown to be given by @xmath133",
    "there is an intriguing similitude between the entropy of the regular bh , given by eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) , and that of a schwarzschild bh with quantum corrections .",
    "specifically , different approaches to quantum gravity predict corrections to the bekenstein  hawking entropy in the form @xcite @xmath134 where the @xmath135 coefficients are parameters which depend on the specific model we are considering .    among all the models employed to extract conclusion from the merging between gravity and the quantum world , a minimal length scale is thought to be a essential ingredient @xcite .",
    "this minimum length can be implemented , for example , as a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , which has been very recently derived from first principles @xcite .",
    "this gup can be implemented using deformed commutation relations which include terms linear ( or quadratic ) in the particle momenta as @xmath136 where @xmath137=i \\hbar \\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "these gup effects have been used to compute the bh entropy @xcite , which is given by @xmath141 therefore , given the similarity between eqs .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) and ( [ gup ] ) , both the charge and the gup parameter can be related by @xmath142 where only a quadratic gup is considered . and , therefore , @xmath143 .",
    "] moreover , the existence of a remnant in the charged case here considered is in complete agreement with similar conclusions obtained within the quadratic gup formalism @xcite .",
    "thus , a quadratic gup can be clearly realized by the nled model here employed which , in this sense , acquires more importance .",
    "in this work , we have managed to derive a regular black hole solution which solves the einstein equations when certain non  linear electrodynamics model is invoked .",
    "this model here considered satisfies the weak energy condition .",
    "moreover , although the matter content is shown to be similar , for small fields , to the ayn  beato and garca solution , the electric field here considered has a very simple mathematical expression , in contrast to other cases .",
    "we have computed the thermodynamic properties of this regular black hole by a careful analysis of the horizons and we have found that the usual bekenstein  hawking entropy gets corrected by a logarithmic term . therefore , in this sense our model realizes some quantum gravity predictions which add a logarithmic correction to the black hole entropy .",
    "in particular , we have established some similitudes between our model and a quadratic generalized uncertainty principle by showing that the charge plays the role of the @xmath140parameter which enters into the later .",
    "this similitude has been confirmed by the existence of a remnant , which prevents complete evaporation , in complete agreement with the quadratic generalized uncertainty principle case .",
    "we note that , although it has been shown that the @xmath64 case represents a regular black hole , other regular solutions with different @xmath99 , together with their energy conditions , remain to be studied .",
