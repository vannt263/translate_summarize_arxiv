    "the main concepts of a wave packet approach to cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) where put forward in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to formulate the model hamiltonian , either the _ jaynes - cummings _ ( jc ) model or the _ rabi _ model @xcite , in terms of the quadrature operators for the field rather than the commonly used boson ladder operators .",
    "the quadrature operators obey the regular conjugate commutator relations like position and momentum of a particle . as such",
    ", the problem can be viewed as a wave packet evolving on two coupled and bound _ potential curves _ ( arising due to the two - level structure of the considered atom ) .",
    "the state of the system is , of course , embedded in the wave packet , where roughly speaking the potential curves determines the internal state of the two - level atom and the vibrational states of the wave packet correspond to the field mode state .",
    "thus , once the wave packet is obtained any quantity is easily calculated .",
    "the jc and rabi models are related through the _ rotating wave approximation _ ( rwa )",
    "in which rapidly oscillating terms are neglected in the rabi model to give the jc one .",
    "correspondingly , the jc model is exactly solvable and the physical quantities of interest are in general represented by infinite sums deriving from the quantized nature of the cavity field .",
    "these analytical results are valid only in the regime where the rwa is justified , and beyond these the rabi model must be considered . in the conjugate variable representation , both models exhibit an _ avoided crossing _ between the two potential curves , crucially affecting their dynamics .",
    "surprisingly , especially around the avoided crossing the solvable jc model shows a non - intuitive wave packet dynamics , while the rabi model display a more expected evolution .    in this paper",
    "we extend some of the results of @xcite and describe how the method can be generalized to multi - level systems .",
    "explicitly , we deepen the analysis about the phenomenon of collapse - revivals and discuss the differences in the evolution between the two models . the approach to collapse - revivals in the jc and rabi models",
    "is somewhat different from the one typically used for wave packets evolution in molecular and chemical physics .",
    "this is thoroughly considered and the relation between the two viewpoints is sorted out . in particular , what is characterized by the _ revival time _",
    "@xmath0 for the jc model is labeled the _ classical period _ in wave packet dynamics .",
    "thus , the time scale set by @xmath0 can become very long compared to what one would expect from the classical period , which comes about due to the internal two - level structure of the model . unlike @xcite , this paper briefly considers multi - level systems , that is when the number of internal states exceeds 2 .",
    "we first consider a simple example of a three - level @xmath1-atom coupled to a single cavity mode , which serves as a prototype of how to extend the theory .",
    "more interesting is the following system of @xmath2 two - level atoms coupled to a quantized field , namely the _ dicke _",
    "model @xcite . here",
    ", the proper basis for the atomic subsystem is a collective one reminiscent of angular momentum states . within this basis , the adiabatic diagonalization is straightforward and the @xmath3 potential curves are regained .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the holstein - primakoff representation @xcite , in which the @xmath3 atomic ( fermionic ) degrees of freedom is replaced by a single bosonic degree of freedom . in such case ,",
    "the coupled potential curves are represented by one potential surface in 2-d .",
    "we proceed as follows . in the next section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the model systems , the relation between the two models [ ssec2a ] is discussed and we give both models in the conjugate variable representation in [ ssec2b ] . in this subsection we also mention how one may derive a semi - classical model that describes the population transfer between the two potential curves as the wave packet traverses the crossing .",
    "a deeper insight of the coupled dynamics is gained from the adiabatic representation , presented in [ ssec2c ] .",
    "the following section [ sec3 ] considers the non - intuitive evolution of the jc model compared to the rabi model , while section [ sec4 ] in detail studies the collapse - revival phenomenon , emphasizing on parallels between these two models and other wave packet systems .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to generalizations of the method to multi - level systems .",
    "firstly , in [ ssec5a ] the idea is sketched using a simple three - level system , and in [ ssec5b ] we consider the dicke model .",
    "finally , section [ sec6 ] gives a summary and outlooks .",
    "in most cavity qed experiments , their characteristics is well described by the jaynes - cummings model , in which single modes and atomic transitions are isolated and coherently coupled .",
    "this is achievable due to the strong atom - field coupling and the use of high-@xmath4 cavities and long - lived atomic states , such that losses can be discarded over typical interaction periods . within the dipole approximation",
    ", a microscopical derivation leads to the _ rabi model _ defined by the hamiltonian @xmath5 here , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the field mode ; @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , the sigma operators are the standard pauli matrices acting on the two - level atom ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) the field ( atomic transition ) frequency and @xmath16 is the effective atom - field coupling . before proceeding ,",
    "we define characteristic time and energy scales by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , and hence introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the interaction in ( [ hrabi ] ) is built up from four terms ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 corresponding to simultaneous excitation / deaxcitation of the atom and the field , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 originating from excitation of the atom by absorption of one photon and vice versa while the first terms are appropriately called _ non - energy conserving terms _ , the latter are termed _ energy conserving terms_. in a rotating frame with respect to the first two terms of ( [ hrabi ] ) , the interaction constitutes precess with either the frequency @xmath26 or @xmath27 , and provided @xmath28 the applicability of the rwa is not solely determined by the requirement ( [ rwacon ] ) , but also on the ratio @xmath29 . for large values of @xmath29 , the typical time scale of the interaction",
    "exceeds the one of free atomic evolution and the time - accumulated error arising from neglecting the non - energy conserving terms becomes important .",
    "thus , apart from the condition ( [ rwacon ] ) between the atomic transition and field frequencies , the validity of the rwa necessitates that @xmath30 @xcite .    given within the rwa , the number of excitations @xmath31 is a conserved quantity , and taking this symmetry into account the jc model is readily solvable with eigenstates @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues read @xmath35 together with the uncoupled ground state @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the algebraic approach applied to the models presented in the previous section is , in many cases , preferable to other methods . in terms of the rabi hamiltonian ,",
    "no exact analytical solutions exist and approximate concepts are developed to find the required quantities in certain parameter regimes @xcite .",
    "for example , this enables for perturbation expansions or truncation of continued fraction solutions .",
    "non the less , the validity of the results are restricted to specific parameters , and to go beyond these one must consider numerical approaches .",

    "both models are identified as two displaced coupled harmonic oscillators , in which , however , the amount of displacement and the character of the couplings are emphatically different . for @xmath49",
    "the two potential curves possess an avoided crossing and the dynamics around such degenrate points have been thoroughly analyzed in the studies of excited diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "typically , the crucial part of the evolution occurs when the wave packet transverses an avoided crossing . to a good approximation",
    "the potentials can be linearized in the vicinity of the crossing .",
    "considering the wave packet as a classical point particle following the classical equations of motion , the population transfer between the two levels while passing the crossing in the rabi model can be estimated by the _ landau - zener formula _",
    "@xcite @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the classical velocity of the wave packet at the crossing , which , of course , depends on the initial state . equation ( [ lzform ] ) directly gives some indicatives of the system behaviours ; for a large velocity @xmath51 only a small fraction is transferred to the opposite state , and the same holds for a modest parameter @xmath15 which couples the two levels . in order for the wave packet to bisect the crossing region , its initial mean position",
    "@xmath52 must satisfy @xmath53 or @xmath54 for an initial state starting out `` on '' the right shifted oscillator or @xmath55 or @xmath56 for the left oscillator .",
    "for such a state , starting out on a single potential curve , a classical estimate of the velocity at the crossing gives @xmath57 .",
    "the evolutions is said to be _ adiabatic _ if @xmath58 , _ diabatic _ in the opposite limit and _ mesobatic _ in the intermediate regime . the same arguments applied to the jc model is considerably less direct as the two potential curves are coupled by a `` momentum '' dependent term .",
    "this term is the background to the aberrance between the two models in a most unexpected way . for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the average number of photons ( directly related to the velocity @xmath51 )",
    ", it follows that the equations can be decoupled , which corresponds to adiabatic elimination of the two atomic internal states .",
    "this will be confirmed in the next subsection .",
    "the previous section introduced the idea of potential curves associated with the rabi and jc models , and the concept of adiabaticity became somewhat clear in this picture . here",
    "we will stress this even further in order to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics . as the jc model is exactly solvable",
    "we only carry out the analysis for the rabi model .",
    "the basis in which the hamiltonian ( [ conrabi ] ) is written might not be the most `` optimal '' one in the sense of decoupling the internal states . in most cases ,",
    "the _ potential matrix _ describing the coupled dynamics has a smooth @xmath38-dependence , such that the characteristic length of derivative terms of the coupling elements decrease with the order of derivatives .",
    "a systematic way to remove the low - derivative terms from the off diagonals is by the _",
    "adiabatic diagonalization_. the unitary matrix @xmath61 that diagonalizates a the potential matrix for the rabi model is given in ( [ eigs ] ) by replacing the angle ; @xmath62 . from the identity @xmath63 where @xmath64 it is clear that the transformed hamiltonian is not diagonal .",
    "explicitly we derive @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 the sizes of @xmath68 and @xmath69 measure the amount of adiabaticity @xcite . from these",
    "we can draw several conclusions ; a large @xmath15 favors an adiabatic evolution , so does a large @xmath38 .",
    "the first is the regular adiabatic dispersive limit .",
    "the latter , however , is noticeably different from typical adiabaticicity in the jc model , but non the less it is intuitive since only close to the curve crossing is the adiabaticity assumed to break down .",
    "it seems that also @xmath70 would give adiabatic evolution , which , however , is false since this limit describes the diabatic evolution .",
    "we recognize the _",
    "adiabatic potentials _ @xmath71 and the internal _",
    "adiabatic basis states _ as @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the internal _",
    "diabatic basis states _ are termed @xmath74 and @xmath75 , with corresponding _",
    "diabatic potentials _ @xmath76 .",
    "thus , a general _ adiabatic _ or _",
    "diabatic state _ is is given by @xmath77 or @xmath78 respectively .",
    "examples of the adibataic ( solid ) and diabatic ( dotted ) potentials are presented in figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "we further note that the rather general form of the adiabatic hamiltonian ( [ adham ] ) shares great similarities to the jc one ( [ conjc ] ) expressed in conjugate variables .",
    "the presence of the @xmath85-dependent term in the potential matrix of the jc model ( [ conjc ] ) , makes its evolution , in some sense , more complex ( or less intuitive ) than for its companion the rabi model . on the one hand , we know that the jc model is analytically solvable and any physical quantity can in principle be obtained from certain infinite sums .",
    "non the less , the fact remains that the wave packet dynamics is still more involved due to this term .",
    "the analysis will be restricted to either initial fock number , or coherent states , which in @xmath38-representations read respectively @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the @xmath88th order hermite polynomial and @xmath89 is the amplitude of the coherent state ; @xmath90 .",
    "thus , in the case of a coherent state , the classical velocity @xmath91 at the crossing . for an initial gaussian ( [ instate ] ) centered at @xmath92",
    ", corresponding to field vacuum , one expects that the wave packet will split up and accelerate down towards the two potential minima @xcite .",
    "this is indeed what we find for the rabi model , while after all , this can not be the case for the jc model since we know that for an initial fock state , the model exhibits rabi oscillations .",
    "thus , for the jc model the field wave packet will either rabi oscillate between the two states @xmath93 and @xmath94 or remain in @xmath93 throughout , whether the initial atomic state is @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "this constrain of the wave packet to the origin is a direct effect of the @xmath85-dependent coupling , and holds for any fock state @xmath97 and therefore also for fock states extending over large ranges @xmath38 .",
    "the wave packet must be considered in its entirety as a single object , or in other words the coherence extending over the whole wave packet must be taken into account and one can not incoherently split up the wave packet in separate individual pieces . from this fact , understanding the influence of the @xmath85-dependent coupling becomes more challenging .",
    "none the less , we have that for a @xmath88 photon fock state @xmath98 and it is reasonable to expect that the `` momentum '' coupling will affect the dynamics due to the large spread in @xmath85 .",
    "these conclusions are visualized in figure [ fig2 ] , which displays the squared absolute amplitude of the wave packet in the two models , together with the atomic inversion @xmath99 .",

    "collapses of physical variables are caused by dephasing between the constitute terms making up the quantum state .",
    "while the collapses are expected , more surprising is the phenomenon of revivals , occurring when the terms return back in phase .",
    "hence , the evolution must be sufficiently coherent in order to be able to complentate the rephasing .",
    "it is clear that revivals in the models considered in this paper is a direct outcome of the quantized grainyness of the field and thus a novel quantum effect @xcite . in other fields ,",
    "the existence of collapse - revivals has been greatly studied , and probably the most significant contribution owes the one of wave packet dynamics describing the vibrations in molecules @xcite . here",
    "the wave packet evolves in a bound electronic potential , where the discreteness derives from the vibrational eigen - modes in the particular electronic molecular state . for a harmonic potential",
    ", a wave packet bouncing back and forth in the potential , will reshape after one period of oscillation , which defines the classical period of motion .",
    "if the potential , however , is anharmonic the wave packet will not fully reshape after one classical period , bringing about the collapse .",
    "depending on the degree of anharmonicity , the wave packet may reshape at later times characterizing the revivals .",
    "for a fairly localized excited wave packet , with average quantum number @xmath106 , we assume @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the spread of quantum numbers . in this case",
    "we expand the eigenenergies accordingly , @xmath109 where @xmath110 and so on .",
    "the various terms define different time scales according to @xmath111 characterizing _ classical _ , _ revival _ and _ superrevival _ times respectively . for a harmonic oscillator only the first of these term",
    "is non - zero and identifies the classical period @xmath112 .",
    "we note that , assuming zero detuning , @xmath113 , the jc energies expand as @xmath114 .",
    "this is not , however , the standard way of deriving the revival times in the jc model .",
    "normally one solves for the time it takes for consecutive rabi frequencies to differ by a multiple of @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 . the derived revival time is not identified with the previously defined @xmath0 of equation ( [ timescales ] ) , but rather associates with the classical time @xmath118 . in other words",
    ", @xmath118 does _ not _ correspond to the time for the constitute wave packets to bounce back and forth in the potential .",
    "however , in the jc model , as well as in the rabi model , one has two internal degrees of freedom , and the dynamics is obtained from both the internal wave packets and their coupled motion .",
    "in particular , reshaping of the wave packet means that both internal wave packets must reform simultaneously .",
    "thus , using the definitions ( [ timescales ] ) , @xmath118 is typically orders of magnitude larger in a multi - level system than for an internal structure - less wave packet evolution .",
    "another way of picturing the phenomenon is that the constitute wave packets must overlap in phase space in order to give rise to interference , manifesting itself in the form of revivals . by introducing @xmath119 as the mean position of the two wave packets @xmath120 , and similarly for the momentum @xmath121",
