    "filaments are possibly the most prominent visible feature in galaxy redshift surveys . the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; @xcite ) has been analyzed showing the observed filamentarity to be statistically significant on length - scales upto @xmath5 and not beyond @xcite , establishing the filaments to be the",
    "largest known statistically significant coherent structures in the galaxy distribution .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite is currently the largest galaxy redshift survey .",
    "studies using two nearly two - dimensional ( 2d ) sections from the sloan digital sky survey data release one ( sdss dr1 ; @xcite ) confirm the earlier result @xcite .",
    "this analysis also shows the filamentarity to be luminosity dependent with the brighter galaxies having a more compact and less filamentary distribution as compared to the faint ones .",
    "a more recent study @xcite using a larger data - set from the sloan digital sky survey data release four ( sdss dr4 ; @xcite ) confirms the luminosity dependence and shows this effect to be considerably enhanced for galaxies brighter than @xmath6 .",
    "this study also shows the filamentarity to be dependent on the colour and morphology of the galaxies .    the possibility that the galaxies are a biased tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution is now",
    "quite widely accepted .",
    "a study comparing the filamentarity observed in the lcrs with the prediction of dark matter n - body simulations finds the n - body predictions to be very sensitive to the bias parameter @xcite . increasing",
    "the bias causes the simulated galaxies to get concentrated into smaller regions which correspond to the peaks in the dark matter distribution .",
    "the large - scale filamentarity of the simulated galaxy distribution is found to decrease with increasing bias .",
    "the filamentarity of the simulated galaxy distribution and the lcrs galaxies in the absolute magnitudes range @xmath7 are found to be consistent for a bias @xmath8 .",
    "an unbiased model @xmath9 and a large bias parameter @xmath10 are both ruled out . comparing the filamentarity in biased n - body simulations with the actual galaxy distribution",
    "provides a novel technique to determine the galaxy bias .",
    "the large coverage and high galaxy number density of the sdss permits us to study the filamentarity as a function of galaxy luminosity . in this _",
    "letter _ we compare the filamentarity of galaxy samples in different luminosity bins drawn from the sdss dr4 against the predictions of biased n - body simulations and use this to determine the bias as a function of luminosity _ ie . _ a luminosity bias relation .",
    "the luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering is an important issue with considerable implications for theories of galaxy formation .",
    "observations show that the luminous galaxies exhibit a stronger clustering than their fainter counterparts ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has remained difficult to quantify this effect through a luminosity bias relation because of the limited dynamical range of even the largest redshift surveys .",
    "traditionally the luminosity bias relation has been determined by comparing observations of the two - point statistics , namely the correlation function or the power spectrum in different luminosity bins .",
    "this allows the relative bias @xmath0 to be studied as a function of the luminosity ratio @xmath1 where @xmath11 is the bias corresponding to the galaxies with the characteristic luminosity @xmath6 or equivalently the characteristic magnitude @xmath12 . to our knowledge",
    "there are three earlier results . @xcite",
    "have analyzed the luminosity dependence of the bias in the ssrs2 @xcite which has been found to be well fitted by a luminosity bias relation @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the 2dfgrs @xcite by @xcite yields a more modest luminosity dependence @xmath14 . @xcite have analyzed the sdss @xcite to obtain a relation @xmath15 .",
    "unlike these estimates , the present analysis uses a global property namely the filamentarity , to determine the luminosity bias relation .",
    "there currently exist several ways to directly determine the bias . measuring the redshift space distortion parameter @xmath16 ( e.g. 2dfgrs , @xcite ; sdss , @xcite ) in combination with an independent determination of @xmath17 allows @xmath18 to be determined .",
    "the bispectrum ( 2dfgrs , @xcite ) provides a technique to determine the bias from redshift surveys without the need of inputs from other observations . a combination of weak lensing and the sdss galaxy survey has been used by @xcite to determine the bias .",
    "we note that most of these methods require large galaxy samples with a high number density .",
    "it has not been possible to apply these techniques to subsamples with different luminosities and determine a luminosity bias relation .",
    "for the present analysis we use seven non - overlapping strips each with sky coverage @xmath19 which lie entirely within the survey area of sdss dr4 .",
    "these strips are identical in sky coverage as the ones used in @xcite and are shown in figure 1 of that paper . for each strip",
    "we have extracted five different volume limited subsamples , bin 1 ... bin 5 , applying the absolute magnitude and redshift limits listed in table  1 .",
    "the thickness of the resulting subsamples increases with redshift . for our analysis",
    "we have considered a smaller region of uniform thickness corresponding to the value at the lowest redshift . for each bin",
    "the area and thickness are listed in table  1 .",
    "for all the subsamples , the thickness is much smaller than the other two dimensions and hence it is collapsed along the thickness resulting in a 2d distribution ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) . for each luminosity bin",
    "the galaxy number density varies slightly across the seven strips and the average density along with the @xmath20 variation is shown in table  1 .",
    "it may be noted that the bins span @xmath21 in absolute magnitude and are in order of increasing luminosity .",
    "the characteristic magnitude @xmath12 has a value @xmath22 for the sdss @xcite and the @xmath12 galaxies appear in bin 3 of our sub - samples .",
    "the galaxy number density falls considerably in the bins containing galaxies brighter than @xmath12 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we show results for the average filamentarity @xmath23 as a function of the filling factor @xmath24 in figure [ fig:2 ] . increasing the coarse - graining causes adjacent clusters to connect up into progressively longer interconnected filaments and as a consequence @xmath23 increases with @xmath24 in the simulations as well as the actual data . at @xmath24 in the range",
    "@xmath25 there is a percolation transition where a large fraction of the clusters get interconnected into a single cluster which spans across nearly the entire survey region @xcite . continuing the coarse - graining considerably beyond",
    "this causes the clusters to thicken and the filamentary patterns are washed away .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the range @xmath26 which is slightly beyond the percolation threshold .",
    "a point to note here is that the @xmath23 curves are sensitive to the area , thickness and number density of the sample @xcite which varies considerably across the luminosity bins ( table  1 ) , and in the present analysis it is not meaningful to compare the @xmath23 values across the luminosity bins . considering any one of the luminosity bins in figure [ fig:3 ] ,",
    "we find that increasing the bias causes @xmath23 to go up at low @xmath24 whereas the trend is reversed at large @xmath24 .",
    "this can possibly be attributed to the fact that with increasing bias the galaxies get concentrated into more compact regions at the expense of some of the large - scale coherent structures .",
    "we also note that the bias dependence of the @xmath23 curves is somewhat different from the luminosity dependence @xcite which shows a monotonic decrease with increasing luminosity . for each luminosity bin",
    "we find that the simulated data - set is consistent with the actual data for only a small range of the bias parameter .",
    "the results of the quantitative comparison of each luminosity bin against the biased simulations are shown in table  2 .",
    "it is customary to use @xmath27 to quantify the luminosity of each bin , where @xmath28 is the median magnitude of the bin and @xmath12 has a value @xmath22 @xcite for the sdss .",
    "the @xmath12 galaxies lie in bin 3 which has a bias value @xmath29 .",
    "the luminosity dependence ( @xmath1 dependence ) of the relative bias @xmath0 is shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "fitting a straight line @xmath30 by minimizing @xmath31 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_{\\rm data}}\\ ] ]    we obtain the best fit values @xmath32 and @xmath33 which gives an acceptable fit with @xmath34 . here",
    "we have assumed that at each luminosity bin @xmath35 is half the corresponding @xmath36 confidence interval .",
    "note that such a low value of @xmath37 is unlikely ( probability @xmath38 ) if the errors in the different luminosity bin are uncorrelated and have a normal distribution .",
    "it is possible that these assumptions do not hold , and a further possibility is that using half the @xmath36 confidence interval overestimates @xmath35 .",
    "we find that our best fit luminosity bias relation is very close to those proposed by @xcite and @xcite , both of which provide acceptable fits to our data with @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the luminosity bias relation obtained by @xcite through fitting the @xcite data is considerably steeper .",
    "their luminosity bias relation shows considerable deviations from our data at both the low and high luminosity ends and is ruled out with @xmath41 .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite who find considerable deviations between their data and the @xcite data at high luminosities .",
    "the observed luminosity bias relation is an useful input for models of galaxy formation .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ) generally assume the brighter galaxies to be associated with the more massive dark matter halos which have a stronger clustering . the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation of @xcite is consistent with the observed luminosity bias relation @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the halo model with suitably chosen parameters can correctly predict the observed luminosity dependence .",
    "we note that the focus of much of these works has been on the luminosity dependence of the two - point statistics .",
    "the largest currently available implementation of a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation ( the millennium run , @xcite ) fails to correctly predict the luminosity dependence of the filamentarity for the brightest galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , it is interesting that our analysis which uses a global property of the galaxy distribution , namely its morphology , predicts the same luminosity bias relation as determined from the two point statistics .",
