    "the shape of the spectrum of an astronomical source is highly informative as to the physical processes at the source .",
    "but often detailed spectral fitting is not feasible due to various constraints , such as the need to analyze a large and homogeneous sample for population studies , or there being insufficient counts to carry out a useful fit , etc . in such cases , a hardness ratio , which requires the measurement of accumulated counts in two or more broad passbands , becomes a useful measure to quantify and characterize the source spectrum .",
    "a hardness ratio is defined as either the ratio of the counts in two bands called the _ soft _ and _ hard _ bands , or a monotonic function of this ratio .",
    "we consider three types of hardness ratios , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the source counts in the two bands , called the _ soft _ and _ hard _ passbands .",
    "the simple formulae above are modified for the existence of background counts and instrumental effective areas .",
    "spectral colors in optical astronomy , defined by the standard optical filters ( e.g. , ubvrijk , u - b , r - i , etc ) , are well known and constitute the main observables in astronomy .",
    "they have been widely applied to characterize populations of sources and their evolution .",
    "the hardness ratio concept was adopted in x - ray astronomy for early x - ray detectors ( mainly proportional counter detectors ) which had only a limited energy resolution .",
    "the first application of the x - ray hardness ratio was presented in the x - ray variability studies with sas-3 observations by bradt et al .",
    "zamorani et al .",
    "( 1981 ) investigated the x - ray hardness ratio for a sample of quasars observed with the _ einstein _ x - ray observatory .",
    "they calculated each source intensity in two energy bands ( 1.2 - 3  kev and 0.5 - 1.2  kev ) and discussed a possible evolution of the hardness ratio ( the ratio of both intensities ) with redshift for their x - ray sample of 27 quasars .",
    "similar ratios have been used in surveys of stars ( vaiana et al .  1981 ) , galaxies ( e.g. , kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ) and x - ray binaries ( tuohy et al .  1978 ) studied with the _ einstein _ and earlier observatories . in the case of x - ray binaries in particular ,",
    "they were used to define two different classes of sources ( z - track and atoll sources ; hasinger & van der klis , 1989 ) depending on their time evolution on @xmath3 v / s @xmath3 diagrams . since",
    "then the concept of x - ray hardness ratio has been developed and broadly applied in a number of cases , most recently in the analysis of large data samples from the _ chandra_x - ray observatory ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2000 ) and xmm-_newton _ ( jansen et al .  2001 ) .",
    "advanced x - ray missions such as _ chandra _  and xmm-_newton _ allow for the detection of many very faint sources in deep x - ray surveys ( see review by brandt & hasinger 2005 ) .",
    "for example , in a typical observation of a galaxy , several tens and in some cases even hundreds of sources are detected , most of which have fewer than 50 counts , and many have only a few counts .",
    "similar types of sources are detected in the champ serendipitous survey ( kim et al .",
    "they provide the best quality data to date for studying source populations and their evolution .",
    "the most interesting sources are the sources with the smallest number of detected counts , because they have never been observed before .",
    "further , the number of faint sources increases with improved sensitivity limits , i.e. , there are more faint sources in deeper observations . because these faint sources have only a few counts , hardness ratios are commonly used to study properties of their x - ray emission and absorption ( e.g. , alexander et al .",

    "2005 ) . with long observations the background counts increase ,",
    "so the background contribution becomes significant and background subtraction fails to work .",
    "still the background contribution must be taken into account to evaluate the source counts .",
    "the sensitivity of x - ray telescopes is usually energy dependent , and thus the classical hardness ratio method can only be applied to observations made with the same instrument .",
    "usually the measurements carry both detection errors and background contamination . in a typical hardness ratio calculation",
    "the background is subtracted from the data and only net counts are used .",
    "this background subtraction is not a good solution , especially in the low counts regime ( see van dyk et al.2001 ) . in general",
    "the gaussian assumption present in the classical method ( see    [ park : sec : classic ]  and  [ park : sec : verify ] ) is not appropriate for faint sources in the presence of a significant background .",
    "therefore , the classical approach to calculating the hardness ratio and the errors is inappropriate for low counts . instead , adopting a poisson distribution as we do here ( see below ) , hardness ratios can be reliably computed for both low and high counts cases .",
    "the bayesian approach allows us to include the information about the background , difference in collecting area , effective areas and exposure times between the source and background regions .",
    "our bayesian model - based approach follows a pattern of ever more sophisticated statistical methods that are being developed and applied to solve outstanding quantitative challenges in empirical astronomy and astrophysics .",

    "we discuss the classical method and present the fully bayesian method for calculating the hardness ratio for counts data . ]",
    "a conventional hardness ratio is calculated as set out in equations  [ e : rchr ] , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the `` soft '' and `` hard '' counts accumulated in two non - overlapping passbands . in general , an observation will be contaminated by background counts , and this must be accounted for in the estimate of the hardness ratios . the background is usually estimated from an annular region surrounding the source of interest , or from a suitable representative region on the detector that is reliably devoid of sources . the difference in the exposure time and aperture area of source and",
    "background observations are summarized by a known constant @xmath4 for which the expected background counts in the source exposure area are adjusted . with the background counts in the soft band ( @xmath5 ) and the hard band ( @xmath6 ) collected in an area of @xmath4 times the source region ,",
    "the hardness ratio is generalized to @xmath7 the adjusted counts in the background exposure area are directly subtracted from those in the source exposure area .",
    "the above equations can be further modified to account for variations of the detector effective areas by including them in the constant @xmath4 , in which case the constants for the two bands will be different . ) .",

    ", classical error - propagation also fails on a fundamental level to properly describe the variance in the hardness ratios . because @xmath18 is strictly positive",
    ", its probability distribution is skewed and its width can not be described simply by @xmath19 .",
    "the fractional difference @xmath3 is better behaved , but the range limits of @xmath20 $ ] cause the coverage rates ( see  [ park : sec : verify ] ) to be incorrect .",
    "the color @xmath21 is the best behaved , but the error range will be asymmetrical when the errors are large .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated ( van dyk et al .",
    "2001 ) that using background subtracted source counts ( which is the case in the method outlined above ) gives a biased estimate of the source intensity , especially for very faint sources .",
    "furthermore , although we can account for gross differences in the detector sensitivity between observations , this is not done in a statistically correct manner , but instead simply by rescaling the background - subtracted counts in each band using additional pre - computed correction factors .",
    "finally , the classical hardness ratio method can not be applied when a source is not detected in one of the two bands ( which is quite common since ccd detectors are more sensitive in the soft band ) .",
    "an alternative method based on the median ( or some quantile ) of the distribution of the energies of the detected counts in a source was suggested by hong et al .",
    "this method can be very powerful for classifying faint sources , but is not suited for comparisons of spectral properties between observations with different instruments . in this method , because the spectral parameter grids are highly non - linear and multi - valued in quantile - quantile space , it is also necessary that the spectral shape of the source being analyzed be known in order to interpret the numerical values .",
    "we have therefore developed fully bayesian approaches to appropriately compute hardness ratios and their errors , by properly accounting for the poissonian nature of the observations .",
    "the value of our method is heightened in several astrophysically meaningful cases . in  [ park : sec : model ] , we describe the model structure we adopt . in  [ park : sec : verify ] , we carry out simulations to compare our method with the classical method . in  [ park : sec : apply ] , we outline various applications of our method ; we demonstrate its use in identifying candidate quiescent low - mass x - ray binary sources in a globular cluster and in studying the evolution of a stellar x - ray flare . in  [ park : sec : discuss ] , we discuss some nuances of our method such as the adopted prior distributions , as well as the advantages and limitations .",
    "a summary of the method and its advantages is presented in ",
    "[ park : sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a detailed mathematical derivation of the posterior probability distributions of the hardness ratios and the computational methods we use to calculate them are described in appendix  [ sec : appa ] , and a detailed comparison of the effects of priors is described in appendix  [ sec : appb ] .",
    "hardness ratios are often used to describe faint sources with very few counts ; it is not uncommon for either or both of the soft and hard counts to be small enough that the source is undetected in that band . the classical method (  [ park : sec : classic ] ) generally fails to produce reliable estimates ( or upper and lower limits ) in such cases , and indeed , it is sometimes not even possible to apply it , such as when the background is large and simple subtraction results in a negative estimate for the source counts .",
    "thus , instead of the gaussian assumptions on the detected counts , we directly model them as an inhomogeneous poisson process",
    ".    since the observed counts are the sum of counts due to the source and the background , and because the sum of two independent poisson random variables is a poisson random variable with the sum of two poisson intensities , we may write , @xmath21 , and @xmath3 , which are used to represent the hardness ratio model parameters in the poisson case ) . ]",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent data points , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the expected soft and hard source counts intensities , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the expected soft and hard background counts intensities , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are correction factors that take into account variations in effective areas , exposure times , and other instrumental effects .",
    "the observed background counts are also modeled as independent poisson random variables , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is scaled by a known correction factor @xmath4 , to account for differences in source and background areas and sensitivities .",
    "we implicitly assume throughout that the observed data are discrete photon events , or counts .",
    "the intensities @xmath31 and @xmath30 may have other units , determined by how the instrument efficiency is supplied .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 is given in [ ct  s  @xmath32  ph@xmath33 , then @xmath23 will have units [ ph  s@xmath34  @xmath35 .",
    "alternately , @xmath27 could describe the exposure time in [ s ] , in which case @xmath23 will have units of [ ct s@xmath33 . in the case where @xmath23 and @xmath24 themselves have the units [ ct ] ,",
    "then @xmath27 and @xmath28 are dimensionless , and usually taken to be unity .",
    "this allows us to compute hardness ratios of fluxes and count rates as well as counts .",
    "we place no restriction on the units of the model intensities ( other than that @xmath31 and @xmath30 have the same units ) ; they are entirely determined by the problem at hand .",
    "thus , our analysis is valid for any instrumental configuration or combination , and the only requirement is that the observed data be described by a poisson distribution .    given the expected source counts intensities ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , it is legitimate for the hardness ratio to be rewritten as @xmath36 these quantities are characteristics of the spectrum in question , rather than of the observed data , like the quantities in equation  [ e : bgrchr ] . as such , the rewritten hardness ratio is of more direct scientific interest .",
    "note also that while these quantities are defined entirely in terms of expected source intensities in the different passbands , the background is implicitly taken into account via direct modeling , as in equations  [ park : eq : sh ]  and  [ park : eq : b ] .      as a new method of evaluating hardness ratios",
    ", we adopt a bayesian approach .",
    "bayesian analysis is explained in detail in numerous articles in the astronomical literature ( e.g. , gregory & loredo 1992 , kashyap & drake 1998 , van dyk et al .",
    "2001 , kashyap et al .",
    "2002 , protassov et al .",

    ", e.g. , @xmath37 ) is combined with the information in the observed data ( the _ likelihood _ , e.g. , @xmath38 ) to derive the probability distribution of the model parameters ( the _ posterior distribution _",
    ", e.g. , @xmath39 ) via bayes theorem , is to be read as `` the probability that @xmath40 is true _ given _ that @xmath41 is true . ''",
    "thus , except for prior distributions , all the probability distributions that we use are conditional distributions . ]",
    "i.e. , @xmath42 and similarly for @xmath43 .",
    "because the posterior distribution in equation  [ park : eq : bayes ] needs only be computed up to a normalizing constant , we often deal with an unnormalized posterior density , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "bayesian statistical inferences for a parameter are based on the posterior distribution , so that we consider its various summary statistics ; see  [ park : sec : stats ] for details .",
    "because the underlying likelihood functions are poisson distributions , we assign so - called conjugate @xmath45-prior distributions for both source and background intensities ( van dyk et al .",
    "2001 ) ; a conjugate prior distribution ensures that a posterior distribution follows the same parametric form as the prior distribution , e.g. , a @xmath45-distribution is a conjugate prior for a poisson likelihood .- prior distribution on @xmath23 is conjugate to the poisson distribution of the source counts among the observed soft counts , denoted @xmath46 in appendix  [ park : eq : eta ] .",
    "the @xmath47 distribution is a continuous distribution on the positive real line with probability density function @xmath48 and has a mean of @xmath49 , and a variance of @xmath50 for @xmath51 . ]",
    "that is , we assign independent @xmath45-prior distributions for the source and background counts @xmath52 and @xmath30 , @xmath53 where the values of @xmath54 are calibrated according to our prior knowledge , or lack thereof , about the parameters ; see  [ park : sec : priors ] for our discussion on choosing a prior distribution .",
    "we describe the application of bayes theorem and the derivation of the posterior probability distribution functions for the interesting parameters in appendix  [ sec : appa ] . here",
    ", we note that since @xmath23 and @xmath24 are independent of each other , their joint posterior probability distribution is the product of the individual marginal posterior distributions , . ] written as ( see equation  [ park : eq : joint ] ) : @xmath55 then the posterior distribution of each type of hardness ratio can be computed by transforming @xmath23 and @xmath24 to the appropriate variables and marginalizing over the resulting nuisance variable , as follows : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the integrals can be computed using either monte carlo integration or gaussian quadrature ( throughout this paper , we use the term `` quadrature '' to refer exclusively to the latter ) .",
    "we use both methods of integration because neither has the clear advantage over the other in our case ; see  [ park : sec : limit ] and appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "bayesian statistical inferences are made in terms of probability statements , and thus we consider various summary statistics for a posterior distribution . here",
    "we briefly describe the standard summaries of location and methods of computing error bars ; a fuller description along with detailed examples can be found in park et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) . commonly used summaries of location are the mean , median , and mode(s ) of the distribution : the posterior mean is the posterior expectation of the parameter , the posterior median is the point that divides the posterior probability evenly such that 50% of the probability resides below and above its value , and the posterior mode is the most likely value of the parameter given the data .    when a posterior simulation of size @xmath60 is obtained with a monte carlo sampler ( see  [ park : sec : gibbs ] ) , the posterior mean is the simple average of the sample draws and the posterior median is the @xmath61^{\\rm th}$ ] draw after sorting the draws in increasing order . to compute the posterior mode , we repeatedly bisect the monte carlo draws and choose the half with more draws until the range of the chosen half is sufficiently narrow .",
    "the midpoint of the resulting narrow bin approximates the posterior mode .    with quadrature ( see  [ park : sec : quad ] ) , we can obtain equally spaced abscissas and the corresponding posterior probabilities .",
    "thus , the posterior mean is computed as the sum of the product of an abscissa with their probabilities ( i.e. , the dot product of the vector of abscissa with the corresponding probability vector ) .",
    "the posterior median is computed by summing the probabilities corresponding to the ordered abscissa one - by - one until a cumulative probability of 50% is reached .",
    "the posterior mode is simply the point among the abscissa with the largest probability .",
    "unlike with point estimates above , there is no unique or preferred way to summarize the variation of a parameter .",
    "any interval that encompasses a suitable fraction @xmath62 of the area under the probability distribution qualifies as an estimate of the variation . of these , two provide useful measures of the uncertainty : the equal - tail posterior interval , which is the central interval that corresponds to the range of values above and below which lies a fraction of exactly @xmath63 of the posterior probability , is a good measure of the width of the posterior distribution ; and the highest posterior density ( hpd ) interval , which is the range of values that contain a fraction @xmath64 of the posterior probability , and within which the probability density is never lower than that outside the interval .",
    "the hpd - interval always contains the mode , and thus serves as an error bar on it .    for a symmetric , unimodal posterior distribution , these two posterior intervals are identical .",
    "the equal - tail interval is invariant to one - to - one transformations and is usually easier to compute .",
    "however , the hpd - interval always guarantees the interval with the smallest length among the intervals with the same posterior probability .",
    "neither of these intervals is necessarily symmetric around the point estimate , i.e. , the upper and lower bounds may be of different lengths . for consistency",
    ", we refer to such intervals as _ posterior intervals _ ; others also refer to them as confidence intervals or credible intervals .    for a monte carlo simulation of size @xmath60",
    ", we compute either the equal - tail interval or an interval that approximates the hpd interval .",
    "( unless otherwise stated , here we always quote the equal - tail interval for the monte carlo method and the hpd - interval for the quadrature . )",
    "the equal - tail posterior interval in this case is computed by choosing the @xmath65^{\\rm th}$ ] and the @xmath66^{\\rm th}$ ] draws as the boundaries .",
    "an approximate hpd - interval is derived by comparing all intervals that consist of the @xmath67^{\\rm th}$ ] and the @xmath68^{\\rm th}$ ] draws and choosing that @xmath14 which gives the shortest length among them .",
    "when the posterior density is computed by the quadrature , we split parameter space into a number of bins and evaluate the posterior probability at the midpoint of each bin . in this case , a @xmath69 hpd - interval can be computed by beginning with the bin with the largest posterior probability and adding additional bins down to a given value of the probability density until the resulting region contains at least a fraction @xmath64 of the posterior probability .",
    "in order to compare the classical method with our bayesian method , we carried out a simulation study to calculate coverage rates of the classical and posterior intervals . given pre - specified values of the parameters , source and background counts",
    "were generated and then used to construct 95% classical and posterior intervals of each hardness ratio using the methods discussed in this article . from the simulated data we calculated the proportion of the computed intervals that contain the true value of the corresponding hardness ratio .",
    "( this is the coverage rate of the classical and probability intervals . ) in the ideal case , 95% of the simulated intervals would contain the true value of each hardness ratio . besides the coverage rate ,",
    "the average length of the intervals and the mean square error of point estimates were also computed and compared .",
    "the mean square error of the point estimate @xmath70 of @xmath71 is defined as the sum of the variance and squared bias for an estimator , i.e. , @xmath72={{\\rm var}}(\\hat{{\\theta}})+[{{\\rm e}}(\\hat{{\\theta}})-{\\theta}]^2 $ ] a method that constructs shorter intervals with the same coverage rate and produces a point estimate with a lower mean square error is generally preferred .",
    "the entire simulation was repeated with different magnitudes of the source intensities , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "intrinsically , we are interested in the following two prototypical cases :      in both cases we adopt a background - area  to  source - area ratio of @xmath75 ( see equation  [ park : eq : b ] ) , i.e. , we take the observed counts in the background region to be 10 .",
    "note that these are written with reference to the counts observed in the `` source region '' , i.e. , the units of @xmath76 are all [ ct  ( source area)@xmath33 , and that we have set @xmath77 here .",
    "the actual extent of the source area is irrelevant to this calculation .",
    "this simulation study illustrates two typical cases , i.e. , high counts and low counts sources : case  i represents high counts sources for which poisson assumptions tend to agree with gaussian assumptions ; case  ii represents low counts sources where the gaussian assumptions are inappropriate . in case  i , the posterior distributions of the hardness ratios agree with the corresponding gaussian approximation of the classical method , but in case  ii , the gaussian assumptions made in the classical method fail .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ park : fig : comp ] , where we compare the two methods for a specific and particular simulation : we assume @xmath78 in case  i and @xmath79 in case  ii , compute the resulting posterior distributions of hardness ratios using the bayesian method , and compare it to a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to the classical estimates .",
    "the right panels in figure  [ park : fig : comp ] show that there is a clear discrepancy between the two methods .    ,",

    "the solid lines represent the posterior distributions of the hardness ratios and the dashed lines a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to the classical estimates .",
    "a prior distribution that is flat on the real line ( @xmath80 , see  [ park : sec : priors ] ) is adopted for the bayesian calculations .",
    "note that as the number of counts increase , the two distributions approach each other . at low counts",
    "the two distributions differ radically , with the classical distributions exhibiting generally undesirable properties ( broad , and extending into unphysical regimes ) .",
    "[ park : fig : comp],width=432 ]        in these simulations , we theoretically expect that the computed 95% posterior intervals contain the actual value with a probability of 95% .",
    "due to the monte carlo simulation errors , we expect most coverage rates to be between 0.93 and 0.97 which are three standard deviations away from 0.95 ; a standard deviation of the coverage probability for 95% posterior intervals is given by @xmath81 under a binomial model for the monte carlo simulation .    table  [ park : tbl : idxes1 ] presents the coverage rate and average length of posterior intervals for small and large magnitudes of source intensities .",

    "note that for small values of @xmath87 , which correspond to a prior expectation of a large dynamic range in the source colors , the intervals are large when the counts are small ( i.e. , the choice of prior distribution has a large effect ) , and decrease to values similar to those at larger @xmath87 when there are more counts .",

    "<S> a commonly used measure to summarize the nature of a photon spectrum is the so - called hardness ratio , which compares the number of counts observed in different passbands . </S>",
    "<S> the hardness ratio is especially useful to distinguish between and categorize weak sources as a proxy for detailed spectral fitting . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this regime classical methods of error propagation fail , and the estimates of spectral hardness become unreliable . here </S>",
    "<S> we develop a rigorous statistical treatment of hardness ratios that properly deals with detected photons as independent poisson random variables and correctly deals with the non - gaussian nature of the error propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the method is bayesian in nature , and thus can be generalized to carry out a multitude of source - population  based analyses . </S>",
    "<S> we verify our method with simulation studies , and compare it with the classical method . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this method to real world examples , such as the identification of candidate quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries in globular clusters , and tracking the time evolution of a flare on a low - mass star .    </S>",
