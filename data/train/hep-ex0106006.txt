    "the spectroscopic studies to determine form factors of the @xmath15 semi - leptonic decays , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , are of importance both in studying low energy properties of the strong interaction in terms of effective theories  @xcite , and also in studying fundamental interactions . in our previous work  @xcite , we reported a result testing the exotic couplings in @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) decay , showing the non existence of scalar and tensor interactions , contradicting the current world average adopted by particle data group  @xcite . in the present work , the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) events , which were collected simultaneously , were analyzed to determine the ratio of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 decay widths @xmath6 .",
    "this quantity is one of the most important observables to evaluate the @xmath13 form factors .",
    "assuming that only the v@xmath18a interaction contributes to the @xmath19 decay , the decay amplitude can be described by two dimensionless form factors , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are functions of the momentum transfered to the leptons @xmath22=@xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the four momenta of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "they are given as , @xmath28 , \\nonumber \\\\ f_{0}(q^{2})&=&f_{0}(0)[1+\\lambda_{0}(q / m_{\\pi})^{2 } ] .",

    "however , if the @xmath32 value derived from @xmath30 data analyses is assumed , the @xmath10 parameter can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ kihon1 ] ) . in this analysis ,",
    "our @xmath30 result for the @xmath32 parameter , @xmath33 , was employed  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath10 parameter can be also determined by studying the dalitz plot distribution of @xmath29 decay or the muon polarization in @xmath29 decay  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the @xmath10 parameter from the @xmath4 ratio is based on the assumption of @xmath11-@xmath12 universality .",
    "this is not the case for the other two methods .",
    "thus , @xmath11-@xmath12 universality in @xmath19 decay can be tested by comparing the @xmath10 parameter obtained from a branching ratio measurement @xmath34 with that obtained from a dalitz plot measurement @xmath35 and/or @xmath36 polarization measurement @xmath37 . in this case , however , a precise acceptance function has to be carefully determined over the whole dalitz space for the @xmath29 dalitz plot analysis .    in this letter",
    ", we present a new precise measurement of the @xmath4 branching ratio and the @xmath10 parameter .",
    "the experiment used a stopped @xmath15 beam in conjunction with a 12-sector iron - core superconducting toroidal spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 was obtained by measuring the ratio of the number of accepted @xmath38 and @xmath30 events corrected for detector acceptance .",
    "the experiment was performed at the kek 12 gev proton synchrotron .",
    "the experimental apparatus was constructed for a t - violation search in @xmath38 decay  @xcite . a schematic cross sectional side view of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : side ] .",
    "we detected both of the @xmath39 decay gammas which enabled us to reconstruct the complete kinematics of a @xmath19 event in contrast to the previous experiment  @xcite ; this increased the reliability of the event selection . because of the rotational symmetry of the 12 identical gaps in the spectrometer and the large directional acceptance of the @xmath39 detector  @xcite , distortions due to detector acceptance were drastically reduced .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the @xmath29 and @xmath40 kinematics reduced the systematic error due to the imperfect reproducibility of the experimental conditions in the simulation of the ratio of the calculated acceptance for the @xmath29 and @xmath40 decays .",
    "the measurement was carried out for two values of the central magnetic field strength , b=0.65 and 0.90 t , yielding a consistency check with regard to the spectrometer acceptance and energy loss estimation in the target .",
    "@xmath29 ( @xmath40 ) events were identified by analyzing the @xmath36 ( @xmath41 ) momentum with the spectrometer and detecting the two photons in the csi(tl ) calorimeter .",
    "charged particles from the target were tracked and momentum - analyzed using multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpcs ) at the entrance ( c2 ) and exit ( c3 and c4 ) of the magnet gap , as well as by the active target and an array of ring counters  @xcite surrounding the target .",
    "particle identification between the @xmath42s and @xmath41s was carried out by time - of - flight ( tof ) between tof1 and tof2 scintillation counters .",
    "tof1 surrounds the active target and tof2 is located at the exit of the spectrometer .",
    "the @xmath39 detector , an assembly of 768 csi(tl ) crystals , covers 75% of the total solid angle .",
    "since photons produce electromagnetic showers , their energy was shared among several crystals .",
    "the photon energy and hit position were obtained by summing the energy deposits and energy - weighted centroid , respectively .",
    "timing information from each module was used to identify a photon cluster and to suppress accidental backgrounds due to beam particles .",
    "the two - photon invariant mass ( @xmath43 ) and the @xmath39 energy and direction were obtained from the photon momentum vectors .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath30 decays at rest were selected by the following procedure , which is similar to our @xmath30 study .",
    "the @xmath15 decay time , defined as the charged lepton signal at the tof1 counter , was required to be more than 5 ns later than the @xmath15 arrival time measured by the @xmath44erenkov counter to remove in - flight @xmath15 decays .",
    "events with @xmath45 decays in - flight and scattering of charged particles from the magnet pole faces were eliminated by a track consistency cut in the ring counters .",
    "events with two clusters in the csi(tl ) calorimeter were selected as @xmath39 decays and events with other cluster numbers were rejected .",
    "the acceptance cut on the invariant mass was 50@xmath46140 mev/_c_@xmath47 .",
    "requirements for the charged particle momentum corrected for the energy loss in the target ( @xmath48 175 mev/@xmath49 ) plus opening angle between a charged particle and the @xmath39 ( @xmath50 154@xmath51 ) removed the @xmath52 events .",

    "the @xmath36 and @xmath41 selection regions are also indicated in the figure .",
    "the timing resolution of @xmath54270 ps provides a good separation between the @xmath29 and @xmath40 events .",
    "it should be emphasized that only these requirements were imposed for the @xmath38 and @xmath40 event extraction .",
    "the numbers of good events after those cuts mentioned above are 12882(10704 ) and 23122(16850 ) at 0.65(0.90 ) t for @xmath29 and @xmath30 decays , respectively , where small fractions due to the background events are still included . fig .",

    "in order to obtain the detector acceptance and estimate the background fraction , the monte carlo simulation was carried out for both the charged particle measurement by the spectrometer and the @xmath39 measurement by the csi(tl ) detector .",
    "the initial dalitz distributions were generated with the values of @xmath56 and the current world average @xmath57 , while the dalitz distribution of @xmath30 decay is insensitive to the @xmath58 parameter .",

    "these spectra are normalized so that the total number of events is the same as the experimental one . here , it is to be noted that much higher statistical accuracy for the monte carlo simulation is necessary to determine the form factors from the @xmath38 dalitz plot analysis .    by using the simulation data , the detector acceptance ( @xmath59 )",
