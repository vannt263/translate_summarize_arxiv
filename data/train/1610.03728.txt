    "the design and modeling of inertial fusion capsules rely on hydrodynamic codes . in the hydrodynamic ( or fluid ) limit ,",
    "the mean - free path of particles is assumed small compared to gradient length scales and the particle velocity distribution is nearly maxwellian .",
    "these conditions are not always satisfied in experiments , and a kinetic description that tracks the particle distribution in phase space is more appropriate .",
    "ion kinetic effects outside the scope of single - component hydrodynamics have been proposed to explain fusion yield anomalies in recent experiments using glass capsules filled with a mix of deuterium , tritium , and helium-3 fuel at the omega laser facility of the laboratory for laser energetics ( lle ) and at the national ignition facility ( nif ) @xcite .",
    "while theoretical investigations @xcite and multi - fluid numerical studies @xcite may guide our understanding of kinetic effects in fusion experiments , they fall short of offering a self - consistent model applicable over a broad range of regimes .",
    "meanwhile , kinetic treatment via vlasov - fokker - planck methods @xcite has quantified ion species separation , non - maxwellian particle distributions , and other kinetic effects .",
    "it was not possible , however , to include the capsule shell dynamics in these previous kinetic studies , leaving large uncertainties compared to experimental observations .    here",
    ", we use particle - in - cell ( pic ) kinetic techniques to model a pair of direct - drive capsule implosion experiments performed at the omega facility @xcite .",
    "these capsules were in an early stage of compression at the end of the laser pulse .",
    "single - component fluid codes such as hydra @xcite can adequately model the ablation process that accelerates the pusher . in order to simulate the remaining convergence and stagnation phase of the implosion with a kinetic treatment of the ions , the conditions from the hydra simulation at the end of the laser pulse",
    "are linked to the pic code lsp @xcite .",
    "our pic simulations include a kinetic treatment of both the fuel and shell ions , are in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental fusion burn measurements , and allow an assessment of the importance of various kinetic and multi - species effects in fusion burn performance .    the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "we describe the simulation set - up and the experiments modeled in the next section .",
    "this is followed by a description of the kinetic simulation results including an assessment of the importance of kinetic effects for fusion burn , and a summary discussion concludes .",
    "in the considered experiments , glass ( sio@xmath0 ) shells of thickness @xmath1 @xmath2 m and a diameter of 1098 @xmath2 m were filled to a pressure of 5.1 atm with a 50/50 equimolar mix of deuterium / tritium ( d / t ) gas .",
    "three such capsules were used in the first set of experiments . in the second set ,",
    "three capsules were filled with an additional 5.6 atm of @xmath3he gas , yielding a molar mix of 32/32/36 d / t/@xmath3he .",
    "note that these implosions are not `` hydro - equivalent '' @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the target implosion was driven directly with 16.3 kj total laser energy in a 0.6 ns square pulse from 60 beams of 351 nm uv light .",
    "ion kinetic effects are modeled using lsp , a pic code with fluid or kinetic options for each plasma species @xcite . because we focus on ion time scales ,",
    "the electrons are treated as a fluid .",
    "an electron heat flux limiter of @xmath4 is chosen to match the corresponding radiation - hydrodynamic simulations , although it minimally effects the lsp results .",
    "the kinetic ion equations of motion are solved by standard pic methods .",
    "each ion species is treated separately , except that the sio@xmath0 glass shell is modeled by a mean ion with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the proton mass ) .",
    "this is appropriate because the shell material is much more highly collisional than the gas , and minimal separation of the si and o ions is expected .",
    "the inter- and intra - species ion collision operators are computed with the nanbu @xcite formulation of the takizuka - abe @xcite particle - pairing algorithm .",
    "we use a direct implicit algorithm @xcite to relax electric field evolution time - step constraints and allow a reasonable turnaround time .",
    "the simulations are performed in one - dimensional spherical geometry with reflecting boundary conditions at both ends and 2000 cells covering the range from @xmath8 cm to @xmath9 cm .",
    "the origin is excluded to avoid numerical instability , and the outside boundary is located sufficiently far to have negligible influence on the capsule .",
    "at least a few thousand particles per cell are necessary for numerical convergence and to reduce noise near the origin , and we initialize our runs with 5000 numerical particles per ion species per cell . exact energy conservation is not maintained by this algorithm , and numerical cooling results in a loss of @xmath10 of the total energy by bang time .",

    "based on the bulk density , velocity , and temperature profiles , the kinetic ion species are initialized with drifting maxwellian velocity distributions . the remaining `` coasting '' phase is simulated in lsp out to @xmath15 ns , which includes shock convergence and the compression phase of fusion burn .",
    "these experiments were selected in part because the coasting phase is relatively long , which allows the incoming shock solution to relax to the kinetic pic physics and leaves time for fuel species stratification to develop .",
    "a series of hydra simulations were carried out with varying input laser energy , which was scaled by factors of 0.76 to 0.9 to account for backscatter ( not measured at the time of this experiment ) and 1d laser propagation effects . the total dt yield from each run",

    ", we do not observe deviations from maxwellian distributions as large as predicted by tail depletion models @xcite , possibly because the boundary conditions and other assumptions required to obtain analytic estimates are not well - satisfied in our calculations .    because the integrated burn in lsp is close to that inferred from a maxwellian distribution , the discrepancy between lsp and hydra is mainly caused by differences in the density and temperature profiles .",
    "the burn - weighted ion temperatures @xmath31 inferred from neutron spectra @xcite in lsp , hydra , and experiment are nevertheless similar .",
