    "in this paper , in the context of the grothendieck theory of `` dessins denfants '' , we describe necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for an @xmath0-edged plane tree @xmath1 to cover a @xmath2-edged tree from the classes of  chains \" or `` stars '' ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . since for a @xmath2-edged chain ( resp . for a @xmath2-edged star )",
    "the corresponding shabat polynomial is equivalent to the @xmath2-th chebyshev polynomial @xmath3 ( resp . to the polynomial @xmath4 ) these conditions correspond to the requirement that , after an appropriate normalisation , the shabat polynomial @xmath5 corresponding to @xmath1 admits a compositional factorisation of the form @xmath6 ( resp . of the form @xmath7 ) .",
    "our main result was announced with a sketched proof in the note @xcite .",
    "here we give a detailed proof and discuss some applications .",

    ". this construction associates to an @xmath0-edged tree @xmath1 a hyperelliptic curve @xmath8 , defined over the field of modules of @xmath1 , such that the divisor @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the points of @xmath8 over infinity , is principal .",
    "the order of the divisor @xmath11 in the picard group of @xmath8 is equal to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a maximal number such that @xmath1 covers a @xmath13-edged chain .",
    "this order is an invariant with respect to the action of the absolut galois group @xmath14 on plane trees and the calculation of this invariant in purely combinatorial terms was the principal motivation for investigations of this paper .    for a tree @xmath1 define its _ branch _ growing from its vertex @xmath15 as a maximal subgraph of @xmath1 for which @xmath15 is a vertex of valency one .",
    "the orientation of the sphere induces in a natural way a cyclic ordering of branches of @xmath1 growing from a common vertex .",
    "say that two branches of a tree @xmath1 are _ adjacent _ if they grow from a common vertex and one of them follows the other with respect to this ordering .",
    "the number of edges of a branch @xmath16 is called its _ weight _ and is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following theorem .",
    "mt let @xmath1 be an @xmath0-edged tree and @xmath18",
    ". then @xmath1 covers a @xmath2-edged chain ( resp . a @xmath2-edged star ) if and only if the sum ( resp .",
    "the difference ) of weights of any two adjacent branches of @xmath1 is divisible by @xmath2 .",
    "it is not hard to see that for an @xmath0-edged tree @xmath1 a number @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "a number @xmath19 ) such that @xmath1 covers a @xmath13-edged chain ( resp . a @xmath19-edged star ) is an invariant with respect to the action of the group @xmath14 on trees .",
    "theorem [ mt ] provides a purely combinatorial description of these invariants .",
    "co for a tree @xmath1 the invariant @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) is equal to the greatest common divisor of all sums @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "differences @xmath21 ) such that @xmath16 and @xmath22 are adjacent branches of @xmath23    the paper has the following structure . at",
    "first we recall a construction from @xcite which explains an algebro - geometric meaning of the invariant @xmath13 and discuss some situations in which theorem [ mt ] and corollary [ co ] may be useful .",
    "then we give conditions for a unicellular dessin @xmath1 to cover an other unicellular dessin , or to be a chain or a star , in terms of arithmetical properties of the canonical involution of oriented edges of @xmath23 finally we prove theorem [ mt ] and discuss some of its particular cases .    throughout this paper",
    "we will freely use the standard definitions and results of the `` dessins denfants '' theory ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . notice that in contrast to the paper @xcite we will assume that all dessins and belyi functions considered below are clean .",
    "in this subsection we recall a construction from the paper @xcite which associates to an @xmath0-edged tree @xmath1 with the field of modules @xmath24 a hyperelliptic curve @xmath8 defined over @xmath24 such that the divisor @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the points of @xmath8 over infinity , is principal .",
    "let @xmath1 be a tree and let @xmath25 be a polynomial from the corresponding equivalence class of belyi functions .",
    "set @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a monic polynomial whose ( simple ) roots are zeroes of odd multiplicity of the polynomial @xmath28 in other words , if we identify @xmath1 with the preimage of the segment @xmath29 $ ] under the map @xmath30 then roots of @xmath27 coincide with vertices of odd valency of @xmath23    prop for an @xmath0-edged tree @xmath1 the curve @xmath8 is defined over @xmath24 and the divisor @xmath31 is principal . furthermore , the order of the divisor @xmath11 in the picard group of @xmath8 is equal to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a maximal number such that @xmath1 covers a @xmath13-edged chain . in order to make proposition [ prop ] useful it is important to have an expression for the order of the divisor @xmath11 in the picard group of @xmath8 in purely combinatorial terms and corollary [ co ] provides such an expression .",
    "below we briefly discuss some applications of proposition [ prop ] .    for any tree",
    "@xmath1 a total number of vertices of odd valency @xmath32 is even and @xmath33 if and only if @xmath1 is a chain .",
    "furthermore , for the genus @xmath34 of @xmath8 the formula @xmath35 holds .",
    "so , the first interesting examples to which the construction above is applicable are the trees with 4 vertices of odd valency .",
    "this class consists of trees homeomorphic either to the letter @xmath36 or to the letter @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and leads to elliptic curves . note that after a passage to the weierstrass canonical form the divisor @xmath38 transforms to a point @xmath39 of finite order on @xmath8 such that @xmath40    for instance ( @xcite ) , the @xmath41-edged @xmath37-tree @xmath42 shown on the fig .",
    "2 leads to the point @xmath43 of order @xmath41 on the curve @xmath44 on the other hand , the @xmath45-edged @xmath36-tree @xmath46 leads to the point @xmath47 on the curve @xmath48 . in the last case",
    "the order of the corresponding point is equal to @xmath49 since theorem [ mt ] implies that @xmath50 0.4 cm = 8truecm    figure 2 .",
    "proposition [ prop ] permits to use for the study of @xmath36- and @xmath37-trees the well developed arithmetical theory of elliptic curves .",
    "for example , in the paper @xcite , as a corollary of a description of groups @xmath51 for elliptic curves over @xmath52 given by mazur @xcite , _ a complete list of @xmath37-trees defined over @xmath52 _ was obtained .",
    "more general , using the result of merel @xcite one can provide a _ lower _",
    "bound for the degree of the field of modules of an @xmath36- or a @xmath37-tree which depends only on the invariant @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting application of proposition [ prop ] is a method for the finding of examples of rational divisors of finite order on curves defined over @xmath52 ( or more generally over number fields ) with @xmath53 . since for",
    "the curves with @xmath53 the results similar to the ones of mazur and merel do not exist , it is interesting how big such an order can be with respect to @xmath54 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . using proposition [ prop ] and certain series of trees one can obtain for instance the following result ( @xcite ) : _ for any @xmath55 from the interval @xmath56 there exists a hyperelliptic curve of genus @xmath54 defined over @xmath52 with a rational divisor of order @xmath55 .",
    "_ note that in order to establish this result we do not have to calculate belyi functions , all the information needed can be obtained from the combinatorial analysis of corresponding trees .",
    "recall that _ an edge rotation group _ @xmath57 of a dessin @xmath1 is a permutation group of oriented edges of @xmath1 generated by two permutations @xmath58 @xmath59 the permutation @xmath60",
    "cyclically permutes oriented edges of @xmath1 around vertices from which they go out in the order induced by the orientation of the ambient surface , and the permutation @xmath61 reverses the orientation of edges .",
    "clearly , @xmath57 can be identified with the monodromy group of a belyi function corresponding to @xmath23    let @xmath1 be an @xmath0-edged unicellular dessin .",
    "then the permutation @xmath62 is a cycle of length @xmath63 .",
    "we associate with @xmath1 a permutation @xmath64 according to the following rule : enumerate oriented edges of @xmath1 by the symbols @xmath65 in such a way that the cycle @xmath62 coincides with the cycle @xmath66 and set @xmath67 so , @xmath68 coincides with @xmath61 but we use a special notation to stress the fact that oriented edges of @xmath1 are numerated in a specific way .",
    "note that @xmath68 is a fix points free involution defined up to a conjugation by some power of the cycle @xmath66 .",
    "conversely , starting from a fix points free involution @xmath68 defined on the set @xmath69 we can construct an @xmath0-edged unicellular dessin as follows : enumerate in the counter - clockwise direction the edges of a @xmath63-gon by the numbers @xmath65 and glue them along @xmath70 two such involutions correspond to the same dessin if and only if they are conjugated by some power of the cycle @xmath66 .",
    "it is convenient to define the involution @xmath68 on the whole set @xmath71 setting the value of @xmath72 , for @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75",
    "equal to @xmath76    mp let @xmath1 be an @xmath0-edged unicellular dessin and @xmath18 . then @xmath1 covers a @xmath2-edged dessin @xmath77 if and only if _ ( i+2d)_(i )  ( mod  2d )  _ and _  _ ( i)i  ( mod  2d ) for any @xmath78 furthermore , if conditions above are satisfied then @xmath77 is also unicellular and is defined uniquely by the condition @xmath79 .    indeed , an @xmath0-edged dessin @xmath1 covers a @xmath2-edged dessin @xmath77 if and only if @xmath57 has an imprimitivity system @xmath80 with @xmath81 blocks such that a permutation induced by @xmath68 on the set of blocks of @xmath80 has no fix points . since @xmath57 contains the cycle @xmath82 such an imprimitivity system should be a collection of the sets @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 consists of numbers congruent to @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 moreover , since the permutations @xmath82 and @xmath89 generate @xmath90 the collection @xmath83 @xmath84 is an imprimitivity system if and only if @xmath91 for all @xmath92 @xmath93 this condition is equivalent to the first condition of the proposition .",
    "the second condition of the proposition is equivalent to the requirement that the permutation of the set of blocks of @xmath80 induced by @xmath68 has no fix points .",
