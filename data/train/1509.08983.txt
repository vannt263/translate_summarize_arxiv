    "one of the most peculiar consequences of inflation is the possibility of leading to a self - reproduction regime ( srr ) of inflating hubble regions ( h regions ) , a phenomenon that became known as eternal inflation ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in eternal inflation",
    "the dynamics of the universe during the inflationary phase is considered in a global perspective and refers to a semi - infinity ( past finite , future infinity ) mechanism of self - reproduction of causally disconnected h regions  @xcite .",
    "looking at the spacetime structure as a whole , the distribution of h regions resembles much like that of a bubble foam .",
    "this scenario seems to be a generic feature present in several models of inflation . in recent years ,",
    "eternal inflation attracted renewed attention due to several factors .",
    "one of them is the seemingly intrinsic connection between eternal inflation and extra dimensions theories , like string theory , and its multitude of possible solutions describing different false vacua , each one yielding its own low - energy constants  @xcite , leading to what has been known by the `` multiverse '' , when combined with eternal inflation .",
    "collisions between pocket universes could upset in some level the homogeneity and isotropy of the bubble we live in and , therefore , lead to some detectable signature in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "this has then led to different proposals to test eternal inflation  @xcite .",
    "eternal inflation has also been recently studied in experiments involving analogue systems in condensed matter .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analogue model using magnetic particles in a cobalt - based ferrofluid system has been used to show that thermal fluctuations are capable of generating @xmath0-dimensional minkowski - like regions inside a larger metamaterial that plays the role of the background of the multiverse . from the model building point of view ,",
    "a relatively recent trend is to look for new models , or specific regimes in known models , where srr may be suppressed .",
    "if eternal inflation does not take place , then its typical conceptual and predictive problems could be avoided , thus allowing the return of a more simple picture of universe evolution .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is discussed as an extension of a cold inflationary scenario where some requirements are established such that a srr could be suppressed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors discuss the possibility of preventing a srr given a negative running of the scalar spectral index on superhorizon scales , motivated by earlier results from planck  @xcite and by the bicep2 experiment  @xcite . in a more recent work",
    "@xcite , it is discussed how backreaction effects impact on the stochastic growth of the inflaton field . the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite have concluded that for a power - law and starobinsky inflation , the strength of the backreaction is too weak to avoid eternal inflation , while in cyclic ekpyrotic scenarios , the srr could be prevented .    in this work ,",
    "we want to study and then establish the conditions for the presence of a srr under the framework of the warm inflation picture  @xcite . in the standard inflationary picture , usually known as _ cold inflation _ , it is typically assumed that the couplings of the inflaton field to other field degrees of freedom are negligible during inflation , becoming only relevant later on in order to produce a successful preheating / reheating phase , leading to a thermal radiation bath when the decay products of the inflaton field thermalize . in cold inflation , density fluctuations",
    "are mostly sourced by _",
    "quantum fluctuations _ of the inflaton field @xcite . on the other case",
    ", in the warm inflation picture , it may happen that the couplings among the various fields are sufficiently strong to effectively generate and keep a quasiequilibrium thermal radiation bath throughout the inflationary phase .",
    "in this situation , the inflationary phase can be smoothly connected to the radiation dominated epoch , without the need , _ a priori _ , of a separate reheating period ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in warm inflation ,",
    "the primary source of density fluctuations comes from _ thermal fluctuations _ , which originate in the radiation bath and are transferred to the inflaton in the form of adiabatic curvature perturbations  @xcite .    we know from many recent studies  @xcite that dissipation and stochastic noise effects are able to strongly modify the inflationary dynamics .",
    "this in turn can lead to very different predictions for observational quantities , like for the tensor - to - scalar ratio , the spectral index , and nongaussianities , when compared to the cold inflation case .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that those intrinsic dynamic changes in warm inflation due to dissipation and the presence of the thermal radiation bath can and should potentially affect the predictions concerning eternal inflation as well .",
    "warm inflation has been studied only from the `` local '' perspective , where only the space - time region causally accessible from one worldline is described . on the other hand ,",
    "the insertion of a warm inflation features in the context of a `` global '' picture , where the eternal inflation description becomes relevant , has been neglected so far .",
    "the different predictions of cold and warm inflation concerning the conditions for the establishment of a srr regime could result in one more tool to select the most realistic model given appropriate observational constraints .",
    "the main question we aim to address in this paper is how the presence of dissipation , stochastic noise , and a thermal bath generated through dissipative effects during warm inflation will affect the global structure of the inflationary universe . for this",
    ", we develop a generalized eternal inflation model of random walk type in the context of warm inflation and use standard tools like the sturm - liouville analysis ( sla ) of the fokker - planck equation associated with the random process and the analysis of the presence of eternal points , which allow us to verify the presence of a fluctuation - dominated range ( fdr ) .",
    "in addition , we introduce the analysis of the threshold value of the inflaton field and the threshold number of _",
    "e_-folds for the existence of a fdr and the counting of hubble regions produced during the global ( warm ) inflationary evolution in order to assess how warm inflation modifies typical measures of eternal inflation . in this work",
    ", we do not intend to address the known conceptual and prediction issues usually associated with eternal inflation ( for a recent discussion of these issues and for the different point of views on these matters , see , e.g. , refs .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly review the basics of random walk eternal inflation in the cold inflation context .",
    "the different ways of characterizing eternal inflation , and those we will be using in this work are also reviewed . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the ideas of warm and eternal inflation are combined and a generalized model is described .",
    "the relevant results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] and , finally , our concluding remarks are given in sec .",

    "eternal inflation refers to the property of the inflationary regime having no end when we look at the spacetime structure as a whole .",
    "this scenario is a generic feature present in several inflation models , provided that certain conditions are met , as we will discuss below .",
    "mathematically , the formulation that allow us to model eternal inflation is mostly conveniently expressed in terms of the starobinsky stochastic inflation program , which describes the backreaction of the short wavelength modes , which get frozen at the horizon crossing , into the dynamics of the long wavelength inflaton modes  @xcite . in this context , the standard equation of motion for the inflaton field @xmath1 can be written as a langevin - like equation of the form  @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , the drift and diffusion coefficients , and @xmath5 is a gaussian noise term that accounts for the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field , whose correlation function is given by @xmath6 . in de sitter spacetime , we can show that the inflaton fluctuations grow linearly as a function of time  @xcite ,    @xmath7    it is assumed that when subhorizon modes cross the horizon ( @xmath8 ) , they become classical quantities in a sufficiently small time interval .",
    "consequently , the large - scale dynamics for the inflaton can be seen as a random walk with a typical stepsize @xmath9 in a time interval @xmath10 .",
    "defining @xmath11 as the deterministic dynamics for the inflaton field , we can distinguish between two typical regimes : i ) if @xmath12 dominates over the fluctuations , the slow - roll evolution of the inflaton field is essentially deterministic ; ii ) in the opposite case , when the fluctuations dominate over the @xmath12 term , then the inflaton dynamics can be treated as a random walk and we have a fdr . in the fdr , random fluctuations of the inflaton field may advance or delay the onset of the reheating phase in different regions , avoiding global reheating .",
    "given a value of @xmath1 that is nearly homogeneous in a region of the order of magnitude of the horizon size ( known as _",
    "hubble region _ or _",
    "h region _ ) and has a value that satisfies the fdr , this h region will expand , generating seeds for new h regions , and this process goes on indefinitely towards future . in a sense , one can say that a requirement for the presence of a srr is that the inflationary dynamics goes through a fdr .",
    "the fluctuations of the inflaton field are represented in eq .",
    "( [ eomei ] ) by the noise term @xmath13 , whereas the term @xmath14 represents the deterministic evolution .",
    "therefore , a fdr occurs when the following condition is satisfied  @xcite :    @xmath15    more precisely , the time evolution of the inflaton field is strongly nondeterministic while the diffusion term dominates over the drift one .",
    "we call eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) the fdr condition .",
    "the fdr condition provides the values of the inflaton field for which a fdr is set , serving as a sufficient tool to look for the presence of eternal inflation .",
    "however , we will see in the following sections that as we leave the cold inflation context and generalize the fdr condition to warm inflaton , it acquires a nontrivial dependence in the thermal bath variables , and we need to introduce additional tools in order to appreciate the presence of eternal inflation . for the sake of comparison , we perform these approaches for both cold and warm inflation .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we introduce the sla of the fokker - planck equation and the analysis of the presence of eternal points , which are generic for both cold and warm inflation cases .",

    "this is a function that describes the probability of finding the inflaton field at a value @xmath1 at time @xmath17 , where the values of @xmath1 are measured in a worldline randomly chosen at constant @xmath18 coordinates in a single h region .",

    "<S> eternal inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on different tools to analyze the effects of dissipation and the presence of a thermal radiation bath on the fluctuation - dominated regime , for which the self - reproduction of hubble regions can take place . </S>",
    "<S> the tools we explore are the _ threshold inflaton field _ and _ threshold number of _ e_-folds _ necessary to establish a self - reproduction regime and the _ counting of hubble regions _ , using generalized conditions for the occurrence of a fluctuation - dominated regime . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the functional dependence of these quantities on the dissipation and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a sturm - liouville analysis of the fokker - planck equation for the probability of having eternal inflation and an analysis for the probability of having eternal points are performed . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the representative cases of inflation models with monomial potentials of the form of chaotic and hilltop ones . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that warm inflation tends to initially favor the onset of a self - reproduction regime for smaller values of the dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> as the dissipation increases , it becomes harder than in cold inflation ( i.e. , in the absence of dissipation ) to achieve a self - reproduction regime for both types of models analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the results are interpreted and explicit analytical expressions are given whenever that is possible . </S>"
