    "as the lhc prepares to uncover the physics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking , third - generation fermions present especially interesting possibilities as their large yukawa couplings make them uniquely sensitive to details of chiral physics at the electroweak scale .",

    "the enhanced yukawa couplings of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 contribute negatively to the running of the sbottom and stau soft masses , so that sbottoms , staus , and stops all tend to be lighter than the other sfermions .",
    "large yukawas also enhance the coupling of sfermions to higgsinos , thereby increasing the sensitivity of sparticle decays to gaugino - higgsino mixing .",
    "in addition , large @xmath6 can lead to large left - right sbottom and stau mixing , further lowering sbottom and stau masses @xcite .",
    "light stops and large sfermion mixing are also motivated by the desire to minimize the tuning in the quantum corrections to the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "light third - generation sfermions lead to a significant enrichment of third - generation final states in the signal @xcite .",
    "third - generation fermions have complicated in - detector decays which require more effort to identify and understand . on the other hand ,",
    "these complicated decays allow for measurement of interesting properties such as polarization ( tops , taus ) and charge ( bottoms ) which are inaccessible for the lighter fermions . exploiting these properties",
    "allows for detailed measurement of various aspects of the lorentz and chiral structure of new physics .",
    "in this paper we consider susy cascade decays which produce third - generation fermions in the final state .",

    "section [ sec : tau - nomixing ] discusses the possible ditau and lepton - tau distributions in the limit of no mixing . in section [ sec : tau - mixing ] we turn on mixing , and discuss fitting algorithms in subsection [ sec : rescaling ] .",

    "@xmath10-quarks are useful tools to study susy cascade decays .",

    "we will study the invariant mass distributions of @xmath10-@xmath7 pairs which arise from adjacent steps in a cascade decay .",
    "susy decay chains which yield adjacent @xmath10-quarks and leptons are the decay of sbottoms through a neutralino or stops through a chargino .",

    "_ this allows one to distinguish between the scenario where the slepton and the stau have the same handedness , and the scenario where the slepton and the stau have opposite handedness . _ to proceed further one would like to identify the handedness of the stau and therefore of the slepton .",

    "the discriminatory power is enhanced by the existence of two channels which must both have the same polarization . with enough statistics we expect that the identity of the stau and therefore of the slepton can be discerned .",
    "in many realistic susy models , mixing in the tau sector is nonnegligible . as left- and right - handed @xmath5 s have different daughter energy spectra , the observable invariant mass distributions will be a weighted sum of the distributions for purely left- and purely right - handed @xmath9s , with weights determined by the mixing parameters .",
    "in addition , as we saw with @xmath10-@xmath8 distributions in section  [ sec : bl ] , reducing the chirality of the fermion - sfermion - neutralino vertices serves to wash out angular correlations from intermediate fermions",

    "the yukawa interactions between the two stau mass eigenstates , the @xmath25 neutralino , and the right and left - handed taus are _ int = _ 1 ( _ r 0 y_1,i ^r + ( 0 ) ^_l ^ y^l_1,i ) + _ 2 ( _ r 0 y_2,i ^r + ( 0 ) ^_l ^ y^l_2,i ) + .",

    "we take this to be our estimate of the total branching fraction of @xmath92 .",
    "these three decay modes contribute a branching fraction of @xmath93 to all tau decays , leaving a total branching fraction of @xmath94 into one - prong taus from other modes , e.g. modes including kaons and continuum modes with no identifiable intermediate hadronic resonance .",
    "we model the hadronic one - prong @xmath5s as the sum of the contributions from the three decay modes listed above .",
    "this incorporates @xmath95 of the contributions to the one - prong mode , and provides a good approximation to the full hadronic one - prong @xmath9s . incorporating the intermediate vector mesons @xmath96",
    "is important as the thresholds associated with the masses and widths of these particles lead to notable features in the visible hadronic energy spectra of polarized @xmath9s .",

    "they are given by ( we drop overall constants ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the angle between the pion and the @xmath9 axis of polarization in the @xmath5 rest frame .",
    "squaring the matrix element and integrating over final state phase space , we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the polarization of the @xmath9 .",
    "these angular distributions can be simply understood by appealing to angular momentum conservation : the left - handed neutrino must carry off the total angular momentum of the @xmath9 , and is therefore emitted forward for initial left - handed @xmath9s , and backward for initial right - handed @xmath5s .",
    "the @xmath5s produced at colliders are typically highly boosted , and the variable of interest is not @xmath100 but rather @xmath103 , the fraction of the @xmath9 ( lab frame ) energy which is carried by the hadronic daughters , @xmath104 in the collinear approximation this quantity is invariant under boosts along the @xmath9 s direction of motion . in terms of the ( unknown ) boost @xmath105 between the @xmath5 rest frame and the lab frame , [ eq : costoz ] = .",

    "these matrix elements are ( we again drop overall constants independent of @xmath114 ) @xmath115 where @xmath100 is the angle between the vector meson and the @xmath9 axis of polarization in the @xmath5 rest frame .",
    "note the longitudinal polarization @xmath116 , which carries zero angular momentum along the tau polarization axis in the tau rest frame , contributes like the scalar pion , while the transverse polarization @xmath117 contributes oppositely .",
    "( note also that angular momentum conservation allows only one of the two transverse polarizations to contribute to the decay . ) in the narrow width approximation , the net distribution of events in @xmath118 is then of the form @xcite @xmath119 in other words , the two different vector meson polarizations make contributions to the @xmath9 helicity - dependent portion of the amplitude which tend to cancel .",
    "the factor @xmath120 is approximately @xmath121 for the @xmath122 , and only @xmath123 for the @xmath77 .",
    "thus , with no discrimination between the separate contributions of longitudinal and transverse @xmath77s , the @xmath77s do not yield much sensitivity to @xmath9 polarization .",
    "in order to obtain a realistic spectrum of hadronic daughter energies , the finite widths of the intermediate vector mesons @xmath122 , @xmath77 must be taken into account .",
    "following @xcite , we use a breit - wigner distribution for the vector mesons , incorporating a running width @xmath124 , as we now detail .",
    "in general the contribution to the decay distribution from the intermediate vector meson @xmath125 takes the form @xmath126 here @xmath127 is the vector meson propagator .",
    "it is convenient to write the total matrix element for this process as a sum of contributions from the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the intermediate vector meson @xmath128 . after integrating over the @xmath129-pion phase space ,",
    "the interference between the vector meson polarizations vanishes and the decay rate given above greatly simplifies .",
    "it is natural to define the lineshape ( or vector meson decay rate ) @xmath130 which does not depend on polarization . by the optical theorem",
    "the lineshape is proportional to the running width of the vector meson , @xmath131 the decay distribution can now be written @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the breit - wigner with a running width , d_v ( m ^ 2_v ) & = & ^-1 + & = & ^-1 .",

    "the parameterization of @xmath77 decay , which proceeds dominantly through @xmath141 , is more involved due to the multiple possible parameterizations of intermediate hadronic resonances in the chiral lagrangian describing @xmath77 dynamics . again following @xcite",

    "this particular parameterization follows from a model of @xmath77 decay which goes through intermediate finite - width @xmath143 alone , with no contribution from other resonances such as the radial excitations @xmath144 .",
    "the coefficients are obtained from a fit to experimental data @xcite .    plugging in the matrix elements ( [ eq : mv ] ) for the initial decay @xmath145 and doing some simplification , we have @xmath146      d_v ( m ^ 2_v)\\ , g_v(m ^ 2_v).\\ ] ] to change variables from @xmath147 to @xmath148 , use ( [ eq : costoz ] ) , with @xmath114 in place of @xmath149 . with this substitution ,",
