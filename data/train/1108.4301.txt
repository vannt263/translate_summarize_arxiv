    "the possibility of high energy @xmath0-ray production within the massive binary systems containing energetic pulsars has been suspected since early 80-ties ( see e.g. maraschi & treves  1981 , arons & tavani  1993 , kirk et al .  1999 ,",

    "@xmath0-ray observations suggest that there are two components in the broad band @xmath0-ray spectra from these sources .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra of ls 5039 and ls i + 61 303 show the cut - offs at a few to several gev .",
    "these cut - offs do not fit nicely to the higher level of the tev emission observed from these two sources . with the discovery of the binary system ss2883/psr 1259 - 63 and evidences of characteristic radio tail within the binary system ls i + 61 303 ( dhawan et al .",
    "2006 ) , the general scenario involving energetic pulsar has been considered in detail for the @xmath0-ray binary systems ( e.g. dubus 2006 , romero et al .",
    "2007 , sierpowska - bartosik & torres 2007 , 2009 , zdziarski et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the level of gev @xmath0-ray emission from these binary systems might be consistent with the contribution from the inner pulsar magnetosphere assuming that the pulsar has the parameters comparable to those observed in the case of the vela type pulsars ( see e.g. abdo et al .",
    "however , such emission should be steady , without any evidences of strong variability with the phase of the binary system ( clearly observed in the case of ls 5039 and ls i + 61 303 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath0-ray emission should be also detected far away from the periastron passage which is not the case of the binary system psr 1259 - 63/ss 2883 ( see tam et al .  2011 , abdo et al .  2011 ) .",
    "therefore , this interpretion seems to be inconsistent with the basic observational facts .",
    "here we consider another scenario which has been recently proposed as a possible explanation of the @xmath0-ray emission from the binary system of two massive stars eta carinae ( farnier et al .",
    "2010 , bednarek & pabich  2011 ) .",
    "we assume that two populations of relativistic electrons appear within the binary systems containing pulsars as a result of their acceleration on a double shock structure created as a result of collisions of the pulsar wind and the stellar wind ( see also arons & tavani  1993 , bednarek & pabich  2011 ) .",
    "these shocks are able to accelerate particles to different energies due to different plasma proprieties .",
    "note that possibility of acceleration of particles on both shocks has been already considered as a possible explanation of the non - thermal x - ray emission from the binary systems containing a millisecond pulsars ( e.g. psr 1957 + 20 , ( arons & tavani  1993 ) and a classical pulsar ( ss2883/psr1259 - 63 , tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "we consider a classical scenario in which an energetic pulsar ( of the vela type ) orbits the massive companion star of the o or b type .",
    "both stars create strong winds which collide within the binary system .",
    "the shock geometry is determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 ( e.g. ball & dodd , 2000 ) defined as follows : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 cm s@xmath5 is the stellar wind velocity , @xmath6 is the mass loss rate , @xmath7 is the velocity of light , and @xmath8 is the rotational energy loss rate of the pulsar estimated from @xmath9 where @xmath10 ms is the rotational period of the pulsar and @xmath11 g is its surface magnetic field strength .",
    "the closest radial distance of the shock from the pulsar ( measured in the plane of the binary system ) is then equal to , @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the massive star , where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 semimajor axis and @xmath16 eccentricity ) is the separation of the stars at the apastron and periastron passages , respectively .    as a result of the collision between the winds ,",
    "a double shock structure appears separated by a contact discontinuity ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the conditions at the shocks created at the sides from the pulsar and the massive star differ significantly .",
    "the shock from the pulsar is relativistic and contains @xmath1 plasma from the inner pulsar magnetosphere which arrives to the shock with large lorentz factor ( of the order of @xmath17 , kennel & coroniti  1984 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the shock from the side of the massive star is non - relativistic and contains electrons with low initial energies .",
    "it is expected that the acceleration of particles on both shocks occurs differently due to differences in the magnetic field strengths and the acceleration efficiencies defined by the so called acceleration parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the value of this parameter is often related to the velocity of the plasma through the shock by @xmath19 .",
    "below we estimate the maximum energies of electrons accelerated in both shocks ( see also recent paper by bednarek & pabich  2011 ) .",
    "5.6truecm    the acceleration rate of particles at the shock can be parametrised by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy of particles ( in gev ) , and @xmath22 is the larmor radius of particles in the magnetic field @xmath23 ( in gauss ) .",
    "we estimate the characteristic acceleration time scale of particles from @xmath24 the acceleration process is limited by the energy losses of electrons through different radiation processes .",
    "we estimate the energy loss time scales for electrons and their maximum allowed energies at the shocks from the sides of the pulsar and the companion star .",
    "the magnetic field at the shock region from the pulsar side is estimated by assuming that it has a dipole structure in the inner pulsar magnetosphere ( below the light cylinder radius , @xmath25 ) and has a toroidal structure in the pulsar wind region ( above the light cylinder , @xmath26 ) .",
    "then , the magnetic field strength at the shock region is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the pulsar wind magnetization parameter ( see e.g. kennel & coroniti  1984 ) , and the distance of the shock from the pulsar is @xmath29 cm . the magnetization parameter is estimated in the case of the crab nebula on @xmath30 .",
    "however , in the case of the shocks which are either closer to the pulsar , or the pulsar of the vela type , the value of @xmath31 can be larger . in our calculations",
    "we assume @xmath31 of the order of @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic field strength at the shock from the massive star has dominating radial structure ( we neglect inner dipolar structure since it extends only close to the stellar surface ) .",
    "then , the magnetic field from the side of the massive star can be estimated from @xmath33 where the surface magnetic field of the massive star is @xmath34 g , and the distance of the shock from the center of the star is expressed in stellar radius ( @xmath35 ) , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "note that for the expected values of the magnetic fields on the surface of the pulsar and the star the value of the magnetic field strength on both sides of the double shock structure and the efficiency of acceleration of particles , @xmath18 , can differ significantly . in the case of the shock in the pulsar wind",
    "the plasma still moves relativistically after the shock with the velocity of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "so then , for this shock we estimate @xmath38 . on then other hand , the plasma in the wind of the massive star moves much slower with a characteristic velocity of the order of @xmath39 km s@xmath5 .",
    "in such a case the acceleration parameter is of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "these different conditions at the shocks from the pulsar and the stellar sides should result in very different acceleration time scales of particles .",
    "the cooling time scales of electrons on the synchrotron and the ic ( in the thomson regime ) processes can be estimated from , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the electron energy and @xmath43 are the energy loss rates of electrons on both processes .",
    "these time scales are estimated as , @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the thomson ( t ) cross section , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the energy densities of the magnetic and radiation fields , @xmath49 is the electron mass , and @xmath50k is the surface temperature of the massive star .",
    "the cooling time scale in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime can be roughly estimated by introducing the value of energy of electrons , into the above formula for the ic losses , corresponding to the transition between the t and the kn regimes , @xmath51 gev .",
    "then , the cooling time scale of electrons in the kn regime in the radiation field of both stars is approximately given by @xmath52 the maximum energies of accelerated electrons should be determined by balancing the energy gains from the acceleration process with the energy losses on the synchrotron and ic processes .",
    "the synchrotron losses dominates over the ic losses even in the t regime for the magnetic field strength at the shock , @xmath53 .",
    "when the acceleration energy gains overcome the ic energy loss rate in the kn regime , then the saturation of acceleration process is due to the synchrotron energy losses .",
    "this occurs for the magnetic field strength fulfilling the condition , @xmath54 .",
    "so then , depending on the parameters of the massive star , its distance from the shock , and the acceleration efficiency , we can distinguish following situations ,    1 .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 : acceleration of electrons is always saturated by synchrotron energy losses at energies above @xmath57 .",
    "this likely happen at the shock from the pulsar side . in this case electrons",
    "lose efficiently energy on the ic and synchrotron processes .",
    "the maximum energies of electrons are obtained by balancing acceleration time scale with the cooling time scale on synchrotron process .",
    "they are equal to @xmath58 note that the maximum energies of electrons accelerated at the shock from the pulsar side increase with the distance of the shock from the massive star as @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 : acceleration of electrons is saturated by ic energy losses in the t regime .",
    "this likely happens for electrons accelerated at the shock from the side of the massive star .",
    "then , their maximum energies are equal to @xmath61 note that in this case the maximum energies of accelerated electrons does not depend directly on the distance of the shock from the massive star .",
    "they are constant for different parts of extended shock structure or the shocks at different phases of the binary system .",
    "@xmath55 : acceleration of electrons is saturated by the synchrotron energy losses ( as in the case ( i ) ) at energies below @xmath57 .",
    "however , these electrons lose most of their energy on synchrotron radiation producing low energy photons .    in summary",
    ", electrons should be accelerated to tev energies at the shock from the pulsar side and to several gev energies at the shock from the massive star side .",
    "we assume that in both cases electrons obtain the power law spectra up to the maximum energies estimated from the above formulae . however , their acceleration rate may be also different on both sides of the contact discontinuity .",
    "note that leptons injected into the acceleration mechanism from the pulsar side already have large lorentz factors due to the confinement in the relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "the maximum power in relativistic electrons is limited by the power of the pulsar and stellar winds . in the case of the pulsars in these binaries",
    "we applied the parameters ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) which result in the total energy of the pulsar wind @xmath64@xmath65 erg s@xmath5 , i.e. between those observed from the vela and crab pulsars . on the other hand",
    ", the power of the stellar wind can be estimated from @xmath66 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "this seems to be marginally enough to supply the @xmath0-ray luminosity of these binary systems specially when we take into account that the @xmath0-ray emission from these systems is expected to be highly aspherical as suggested by the observed @xmath0-ray light curves ( abdo et al .",

    "the aim of these example calculations is to show that the features of the @xmath0-ray spectra expected in such a model are generally consistent with the @xmath0-ray observations of the binary system ls i + 61 303 .",
    "we realize that the details of the spectrum may depend on many not well known parameters , e.g. the exact shape of the double shock structure , dependence of the injection efficiency and the spectrum of electrons on the location in different parts of the shock and at different phases , possible existence of the aspherical wind and its geometry ( expected in the case of ls i + 61 303 ) , the unknown parameters of the pulsar and the acceleration process ( e.g. dependence of acceleration efficiency on the location at the shock ) .",
    "these parameters are impossible to fix precisely enough at the present stage of our knowledge .",
    "therefore , any detailed fitting of the @xmath0-ray spectra of these sources are premature . in our calculations",
    "we have fixed the surface magnetic field strength of the massive star on 100 g which seems to be typical for the the o and b type stars .",
    "the lorenz factor of the pulsar wind at the distance of the shock has been fixed on @xmath101 .",
    "it is assumed that leptons injected into the shock acceleration process have such minimum energies , i.e. @xmath102 gev .",
    "the maximum energies of leptons accelerated at the shock from the pulsar side can be in principle even significantly larger ( than estimated in tab .",
    "2 ) , in the case of faster rotating pulsar with weaker surface magnetic field or if the significant reconnection of the magnetic field occurs in the pulsar wind resulting in the lower value of the magnetization parameter ( see e.g. sierpowska & bednarek 2005 ) .",
    "the results of these example calculations are shown in fig .  2 for the injection region located at the closest part of the shock to the massive star , i.e. @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and assuming this same spectral index for both populations of electrons equal to -2 .",
    "we do not have at present enough knowledge to conclude what is the injection rate of relativistic electrons at different parts of the shock structure and at different phases of the system .",
    "therefore , it is rather difficult to predict the exact shape of the @xmath0-ray spectrum producted by electrons accelerated at the extended shock region .",
    "the calculations are performed for the inclination angle of the binary system equal to @xmath105 and the longitude of the periastron @xmath106 ( grundstrom et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "as expected , two populations of electrons produce two distinct components in the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the gev flux can change by a factor of a few even in the case of this same injection rate of electrons at the shock from the side of the massive star . on the other hand ,",
    "the tev flux does not show similar variability between periastron and apastron passages .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the considered ic @xmath1 pair cascade model which produce more anisotropic emission at gev energies ( more concentrated on the directions close to the massive star ) than at tev energies ( see e.g. bednarek  2000 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath0-ray spectra produced by electrons accelerated at the shock from the side of the massive star fits reasonably well to the synchrotron spectrum produced by primary leptons accelerated at the shock from the side of the pulsar . for the considered parameters , the magnetic field strength at the shocks from the side of the pulsar and the massive star are comparable in the case of ls i + 61 303 ( of the order of @xmath107 g at the periastron and @xmath108 g at the apastron ) .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron emission from the secondary cascade @xmath1 pairs should not completely dominate the synchrotron emission from the primary electrons .",
    "the relative importance of the synchrotron emission from secondary cascade @xmath1 pairs should be even lower for electrons accelerated at the parts of the shock which are farther from the massive star due to lower average magnetic field strength in the massive star wind .",
    "4.9truecm    the spectra presented in fig .  2 are obtained by assuming that relativistic electrons can cool locally on the ic and synchrotron processes to energies @xmath64100 mev , i.e. close to the acceleration place in the shock .",
    "in fact , the cooling time scale of electrons in the radiation field of the star is much shorter than the dynamical time scale of the pulsar on its orbit around the star , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the velocity of the pulsar on its orbit .",
    "also the advection time scale of electrons along the shock , @xmath111 , is much longer than the ic cooling time scale .",
    "as we already noted , important complication to the considered scenario can be introduced by the aspherical wind of the massive star , as expected in the case of ls i + 61 303 or ss2883/psr1259 - 63 ( see sierpowska - bartosik & bednarek  2008 ) .",
    "the aspherical winds can significantly change the localization of the shock structure for different phases of the pulsar resulting in different parameters at the shock and consequently different maximum energies of electrons and possibly also their injection rates .",
    "this effects can influence the observed @xmath0-ray light curves from these binary systems at gev and tev energy ranges .",
    "note that also ions can be accelerated at the shock from the side of the massive star .",
    "however they are not able to lose efficicently energy in hadronic collisions with the matter of the stellar wind during their advection time along the shock surface for the parameters of ls + 61 303 .",
    "we propose a simple model for the explanation of the two - component @xmath0-ray spectra observed from @xmath0-ray binaries ( ls 5039 and ls i + 61 303 ) , presumably containing energetic pulsars , in which electrons are accelerated to different maximum energies at the shocks in the pulsar and stellar winds .",
    "we show that for the maximum energies of electrons , accelerated at the shock from the side of the massive star , should not depend on the distance from the star ( and so on the phase of the binary system ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the cut - off in the gev part of the spectra should be independent on the phase of the binary .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum energies of leptons accelerated at the shock from the pulsar side depend on the distance as @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the tev @xmath0-ray spectra should extend to larger energies at the apastron passage . in the case of injection rate of electrons",
    "independent of the phase , the model predicts strong variability at gev energies at much lower variability at tev energies for the parameters of the binary system ls i + 61 303 .",
    "we comment that the detailed modelling of the @xmath0-ray light curves and spectra from these @xmath0-ray binary systems is at present very difficult since it depends on many parameters which are not known with enough precision .",
