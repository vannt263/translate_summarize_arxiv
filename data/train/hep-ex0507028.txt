    "a talk of this length does not allow even a representative survey of open - charm and charmonium analyses at belle , so i ve made a selection favoring the most interesting recent developments  concerning the exotic @xmath0 state  and topics of interest to the deep inelastic scattering community .",
    "due to length limitations , the writeup is even more cursory than the talk .",
    "interested readers should consult the references .",
    "the aim of the belle collaboration is to study violation of the cp symmetry , using the time - dependence of decays of @xmath3 pairs .",
    "open - charm and charmonium studies are an active sideline .",
    "the kekb collider  @xcite produces @xmath4 and @xmath5 continuum events with unprecedented luminosity : both @xmath6-decays and the continuum are copious sources of charmed and charmonium states .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite , at the kekb interaction point , is a general - purpose detector with good particle i d capabilities .",
    "the @xmath0 , a narrow state decaying to @xmath7 , was discovered in @xmath8 decays by belle  @xcite , and confirmed by three other groups  @xcite . in subsequent analysis ,",
    "it has not been possible to match the properties of the @xmath9 with those of an expected @xmath10 state  @xcite .",
    "belle has recently reported the observation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays  @xcite , confirming that the c - parity of the @xmath9 must be even .",
    "an angular analysis of @xmath0 decays has also been performed  @xcite , exploting zeroes in predicted distributions  @xcite to test various @xmath13 hypotheses .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - x3872 - 0 + - ] .",
    "the @xmath14 dipion mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - x3872-mpipi ] .",
    "the rate near the kinematic boundary is sensitive to the parity of the @xmath9 : for @xmath15 and even parity , @xmath16 dependence is expected ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 in s - wave , ignoring d - wave admixture ) ; for odd parity , @xmath19 ( p - wave ; ignoring f - wave ) .",
    "fits to the two cases find @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for 39 degrees of freedom , favoring @xmath22 hypotheses .",
    "@xmath23 is disfavored by angular distributions , and @xmath24 by preliminary evidence for decays to @xmath25  @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath26 hypothesis is consistent with available data ; all other assignments are disfavored by at least one test . however , the identification of the @xmath0 with the @xmath27 charmonium state @xmath28 is unlikely : potential model predictions for the @xmath28 mass are 3953@xmath29 , and shift upward when coupling to open charm is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the isospin - violating @xmath30 decay would presumably have a small partial width , similar to @xmath31  @xcite , to be compared with a total width @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this contradicts babar s 90% confidence limit @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the low ratio of radiative and hadronic partial widths",
    "@xmath34  @xcite also disfavors @xmath28 .",
    "distribution for events in the @xmath0 signal region ( points ) and sideband ( shaded ) .",
    "fits to @xmath22 ( solid ) and @xmath35 ( dashed ) hypotheses are also shown : see the text.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    by contrast , the observed properties of the @xmath0 are consistent with those of a @xmath36 bound state  @xcite : the mass is within errors of @xmath37@xmath38  threshold , @xmath39 ; as the mass difference @xmath40 is large by comparison , isospin violation is natural for such a state , explaining the observation of @xmath41 _ and _ @xmath42 decays .",
    "these decays are natural within the model of swanson  @xcite , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 appear as admixtures to the @xmath45 wavefunction . a small branching ratio @xmath46 is also expected for such a state .",
    "the process @xmath48 was discovered by belle in both double charmonium ( @xmath49 ) and associated charm ( @xmath50 ) production ; both processes have unexpectedly large rates  @xcite .",
    "various proposed alternative explanations of the data have been contradicted by further tests , including angular analysis and full reconstruction of @xmath51 events  @xcite .",
    "the principal results have recently been confirmed by babar  @xcite .",
    "evidence for a new state , @xmath47 , seen in the recoil mass ( @xmath52 ) spectrum in @xmath53 events , was presented in 2004 at the beijing conference  @xcite .",
    "decays of this state favor @xmath54 , based on a study of events with reconstructed @xmath18 and @xmath55 mesons .",
    "an updated analysis confirming these results is being prepared for publication this summer  @xcite .",
    "an enhancement at @xmath12 threshold has been seen in @xmath56  @xcite . interpreted as a particle ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , this `` @xmath59",
    "'' would be exotic : a @xmath10 state at this mass would be expected to decay to @xmath60 , with very small branching fractions for @xmath12 and other hadronic charmonium transitions .",
    "belle observed the @xmath61 and @xmath62 in both continuum production  @xcite and @xmath6 decays  @xcite , confirming the observations by babar and cleo  @xcite , establishing the @xmath63 decay , and favoring @xmath64 , based on the @xmath65 helicity angle distribution .",
    "study of @xmath66  @xcite likewise favors @xmath67 .",
    "searches for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 state of selex  @xcite find no evidence of production in @xmath6 decays or the continuum at belle  @xcite .    amongst other charmed baryon results , a new isospin triplet @xmath70 decaying to @xmath71 has been observed in the continuum  @xcite .",
    "it is tentatively identified as the @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , with some admixture of the @xmath74 ( with the same quantum numbers ) .    of the belle pentaquark searches reported in 2004  @xcite , the most important uses interactions of kaons ( from @xmath75 annihilation ) with the material of the detector .",
    "this study placed a limit on production of the @xmath76 relative to the @xmath77 : an updated analysis , to be published in the summer of 2005  @xcite , also bounds the rate of exclusive production @xmath78 , with similar sensitivity to that of diana  @xcite .    a major study of charm fragmentation in @xmath79 at @xmath80 will also be submitted for publication this summer  @xcite .",
    "fractional momentum distributions for @xmath55 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 mesons , and the @xmath83 , are measured with much greater precision than in previous studies ; a comparison of fragmentation functions is also presented .",
    "recent belle analyses include a study of @xmath0 decays and properties , favouring @xmath26 and the @xmath36 molecular model .",
    "other contributions to spectroscopy include the @xmath59 , double charmonium production ( including @xmath84 ) , and pentaquark searches",
    ". a study of charm fragmentation has also been performed .",
    "many other results in charm and charmonium studies lie outside the scope of this talk .",
    "i d like to thank my colleagues at belle for their help in preparing this talk , and the organisers of the deep inelastic scattering workshop .",
    "the work of madison s fine local breweries was also greatly appreciated ."
