    "in the case of most pulsars , their observed radio spectra can be described using a power law with a negative spectral index of @xmath01.8 or ( for a small fraction of sources ) two power laws with spectral indices of @xmath00.9 and @xmath02.2 with a break frequency @xmath1 on average of 1.5 ghz @xcite .",
    "some pulsars also exhibit a low - frequency turnover in their spectra  @xcite .",
    "a spectrum of that kind is characterized by a positive spectral index below a peak frequency @xmath2 of about 100 mhz ( with a few exceptions when the spectrum peaks at frequencies up to several hundred mhz ) .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out a small sample of pulsars that peak around 1 ghz and above .",
    "such an object , called the gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) pulsar , is described as a relatively young source that has a high dispersion measure ( dm ) and usually adjoins a dense , sometimes extreme vicinity .",
    "this suggests that the gps in pulsars might be caused by either the conditions around neutron stars or the physical properties of the interstellar medium .",
    "the strongest argument for environmental origin of the high - frequency turnover in radio pulsars spectra is the evolution of psr  b1259@xmath063 spectrum .",
    "@xcite showed that the spectrum of the pulsar at the various orbital phases exhibits both a shape and a peak frequency evolution due to the orbital motion of the pulsar around its companion be star ls 2883 on a very elliptical orbit .",
    "the psr  b1259@xmath063 spectrum demonstrates a strong similarity with the gigahertz - peaked spectra , especially when the pulsar in its motion gets closer to its companion star .",
    "@xcite proposed two effects which can be responsible for the observed variations , the free - free absorption in the stellar wind and the cyclotron resonance in the magnetic field associated with the disk of be star .",
    "both these processes assume the absorption to be caused by external factors , like in the cases of the isolated gps pulsars  @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the radio spectra of two magnetars psrs j1550@xmath05418 and j1622@xmath04950 and in both cases their radio spectra clearly peak at the frequencies of a few ghz .",
    "both these magnetars are associated with supernova remnants and hence surrounded by ionized gas which can be responsible for the free - free absorption of the radio waves .",
    "the authors concluded that the gps feature in radio magnetars spectra can be of environmental origin , in the same way as it occurs in the vicinity of gps pulsars .",
    "pulsars with a high - frequency turnover in their spectra have represented the smallest group of the radio pulsar spectra types .",
    "however , @xcite estimated that the number of such sources may constitute up to 10% of the whole pulsar population .",
    "the sample of gps pulsars was extended to include psr j2007 + 2722 , whose flux density measurements were presented by  @xcite . recently ,  @xcite reported two newly - identified gps pulsars .",
    "one of them , psr b1740 + 1000 , is the first low - dm pulsar that exhibits the gigahertz - peaked spectrum .",
    "this case , along with the gps phenomenon in radio magnetars , led the authors to conclude that the gps candidate selection criteria need to be revisited .",
    "in future searches for new gps pulsars , the presence of interesting ( or extreme ) environments , instead of the high dm , could play a crucial role in the source selection process .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the small number of the currently known gps pulsars may be the result of our limited knowledge of pulsar spectra in general , especially below 1 ghz .",
    "the authors outlined the need for a more extensive sample of gps sources to establish a plausible statistics about those objects .",
    "however , in the cases of some gps candidate pulsars the standard pulsar flux measurement methods are affected by strong scattering at low frequencies .",
    "the phenomenon causes the pulse profiles to become broader , i.e. pulses attain roughly exponentially decaying scattering tail .",
    "it has been shown that the characteristic broadening of the pulse , @xmath3 , depends on both the observing frequency , as well as dm ( the empirical relation was given by  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "recent results on scattering were discussed by  @xcite in their analysis of 45 pulsars , based on the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and the effelsberg radio telescope observations .",
    "since the scattering becomes stronger at lower frequencies , for a given pulsar the flux becomes increasingly underestimated then . for high - dm pulsars at low frequencies ,",
    "when the scattering time is greater than the pulsar period by a significant factor , one will see no pulsed emission .",
    "thus , the flux density measurements required to construct radio pulsar spectra using  traditional \" methods can be difficult or sometimes impossible to conduct .",
    "for these cases the only way to determine the pulsar flux is using the interferometric imaging techniques ( see for example @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the interferometric measurements of pulsar fluxes at both 325 mhz and 610 mhz using the gmrt have been demonstrated in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the imaging techniques provide a superior alternative to the standard flux measurements , especially in our studies since the sources we selected for observations are high - dm pulsars .",
    "for some of them the imaging techniques are the only secure means to estimate their flux .",
    "there is at least two reasons for employing imaging techniques .",
    "firstly , flux calibration in an interferometer is more robust due to the baseline lying at zero level thereby reducing errors made during the baseline subtraction of a normal pulsar observation .",
    "secondly , the instrumental and atmospheric gain fluctuations on very short time scales can be corrected using self - calibration of the interferometric data .",
    "the corrections are determined by flux densities of constant and bright background sources in the field and hence would not be affected by the pulse variation of the relatively weak pulsar at a field center .    in this paper we present flux measurements of six pulsars observed at the 610 mhz frequency band of the gmrt using interferometric imaging technique .",
    "the sources selected for our studies are gps pulsars or gps candidates .",
    "we chose the 610 mhz band for these studies , firstly , because the frequency is low enough to estimate whether a given object is indeed a gps pulsar , secondly , due to the higher probability of detecting gps pulsars at 610 mhz than at lower frequencies as a result of their inverted spectra at sub - ghz frequencies and finally , to avoid the rfi and other systematic effects that are prominent at lower frequencies .",
    "this analysis allowed us to inspect flux densities of some objects and select a strong gps candidate pulsar .",
    "we were able to confirm that the the interferometric imaging technique can be successfully applied to estimate flux density of pulsars .",
    "24 and b1849 + 00 at the field centers were identified and their average flux across the three sessions were calculated .",
    "the ratio of the flux of each source with respect to the average flux and as a function of the average flux is plotted in the figure , with each session marked with different symbols .",
    "the ratios are scattered around unity with the noise in the scatter decreasing with the increasing flux levels .",
    "this demonstrates the analysis process to be correct and consistent for all the three observing sessions.,width=321 ]    we recorded the interferometric data on six pulsars using the gmrt that is located near pune , india and consists of an array of 30 distinct dishes , each with a diameter of 45 meters , and a total of 435 baselines .",
    "the dishes are spread out over a region of @xmath4 27 km and roughly resemble a y - shaped array .",
    "the data were recorded at the 610 mhz frequency band with a bandwidth of 33 mhz spread over 256 frequency channels .",
    "all the six sources were observed on three separate dates : 30 december 2012 , 6 january 2013 and 13 january 2013 , each observation separated by a week , to account for variations in the pulsar flux over long time scales .",
    "the observations were carried out using standard schemes where strategically placed calibrators were interspersed with the sources .",
    "we recorded flux calibrators 3c48 and 3c286 before and after each observing run for 10 min .",
    "the antenna gain variations were determined using a phase calibrator observed every half hour .",
    "the sources in our sample are nearby in terms of their position in the sky and the phase calibrator 1822@xmath0096 was used for all the sources to carry out amplitude and phase calibrations as well as bandpass calibration to correct for variation across frequency band .",
    "each of the pulsars was observed for 10 minutes at a time and six such observations on each source were well spaced out during each of the observing sessions which lasted for about eight hours .",
    "we recorded one hour of data on each pulsar during each observing run with all the sources having a wide coverage in the u - v plane due to our strategy of spacing out their pointings .",
    "the data reduction was done using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) where we used standard techniques of rfi flagging , calibration and imaging .",
    "the flux scales were determined using the measurements of @xcite with latest corrections by perley et al .",
    "2010 ( in aips ) .",
    "all the pulsar fields during each observing run was passed through multiple rounds of self - calibration and imaging to improve noise characteristics in the maps .",
    "the following checks were performed to test the fidelity of the images : + 1 .",
    "the flux of the source 1822@xmath0096 ( phase calibrator ) was determined for each of the three observing sessions using both the flux calibrators 3c48 and 3c286 .",
    "the flux value for each of the sessions were 6.3@xmath50.5 on 30 december 2012 , 6.2@xmath50.5 on 6 january 2013 and 6.3@xmath50.5 on 13 january 2013 .",
    "this shows that the various independent calibrations applied during each separate observations and also different flux calibrators gave identical results demonstrating the technique to be correct .",
    "in addition the correctness of the flux scale was demonstrated by comparing the flux value of the phase calibrator to the expected value ( between 325 mhz and 1.4 ghz ) which yielded consistent results .",
    "we performed an additional test for determining the correctness of the analysis techniques .",
    "the same fields were observed on multiple days with independent calibrations for the system .",
    "each of the pulsar fields imaged , with the pulsar at a field center , had a half power radius of @xmath4 40 arcmin with a large number of sources in each field of view .",
    "if an analysis is correct then the flux of all these sources , in an ideal scenario , should be identical for all the observations .",
    "however , under realistic conditions one expects some noise across the different observing runs . to demonstrate this we used two ( out of six ) pulsar fields and determined the flux values of all the strong sources ( flux greater than 10 times the rms noise in a map ) for all the three observing runs .",
    "an average flux for each source across the three observing runs was calculated and the ratio of the flux to average flux was plotted as a function of the source flux value ( see figure  [ flux_ratio ] ) . as is clear from the figure the flux ratios are concentrated around unity with the noise increasing with decreasing flux level of a source .",
    "this is exactly as per our expectations and clearly demonstrates the correctness of our calibration and analysis techniques across the three observing sessions .",
    "table  [ tabgmrt1 ] gives the list of sources with some of their basic parameters ( dm , age and period ) .",
    "all these objects are either confirmed or candidate gps sources .",
    "as it is clear from the table , the sample was subdivided into two categories .",
    "we have made rough estimates of the scattering timescales using either observational data  @xcite or the predictions derived from a single thin screen model ( using the scatter time frequency scaling index @xmath6 ) .",
    "for the first group of pulsars , psrs b1750@xmath024 , b1815@xmath014 and b1849 + 00 , the pulse broadening at 610 mhz is large , hence the interferometric imaging provides the only mean to estimate flux for these sources .",
    "the flux density of the remaining pulsars , psrs b1800@xmath021 , b1822@xmath014 and b1823@xmath013 , was measured at low frequencies by conventional pulsar observations @xcite , however since the predicted ( or measured ) scatter time estimates are a significant fraction of the pulsar periods , there is a possibility for the flux densities measured that way to be underestimated . additionally , these three sources have counterparts in the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) observations with indications of pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) around them . @xcite and",

    "for the purpose of constructing pulsar spectra we are using an average of values obtained from these measurements .",
    "we have to note however , that in this regard the interferometrically measured flux density values are not affected any more than the ones resulting from the standard observing procedure .",
    "pulsar flux measurements regardless of the method used will be affected by the scintillation - driven flux variation in exactly the same way .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , for high - dm pulsars , and especially when the observations are conducted at low observing frequencies , the pulsar profiles can be affected by interstellar scattering to such an extent that it is difficult , or even impossible to perform flux measurement using the standard profile - based method .",
    "strong scattering causes the profiles to attain scattering tails , what may significantly affect the observed profile background level so that the proper baseline required for the standard flux measurement can not be found . especially prone to such errors will be the cases where the scatter time is comparable to the pulse period , as one will still be able to see a prominent pulse , while the scattering tail will hide the proper baseline level .",
    "one has to remember that even a `` moderate '' length of the scattering tail may still affect the profile baseline and cause erroneous results , especially when the observations are affected by a high noise level @xcite . in some circumstances the influence of scattering may even change the appearance of the spectrum by mimicking a turnover feature , which may lead to an erroneous identification of a pulsar as a gps source , like in the case of psr b1815@xmath014 .    since there is no simple way to account for the scattering - induced baseline level change one should refrain from using the standard method in such cases .",
    "practically , however , it can be hard to judge if we are dealing with a profile where scattering led to an erroneous flux density estimation .",
    "we believe that at least some of the past flux measurements performed for the pulsars from our sample might have been affected by the scattering , which is discussed below .",
    "regardless , to avoid the scattering - induced issues one needs a reliable method of pulsar flux density measurement that will not be affected by scattering .",
    "interferometric imaging techniques at low radio frequencies have been used to determine flux density of a wide class of astronomical sources and can be easily extended to determine pulsar flux values .",
    "the estimated flux of the phase calibrator 1822@xmath0096 at 610 mhz was identical over the three widely separated observing sessions and using two different flux calibrators 3c48 and 3c286 .",
    "in addition its flux estimates are in the expected range when compared with the flux densities at 325 mhz and 1.4 ghz ( from the very large array calibrator manual ) .",
    "the consistency of our calibrations over the different observing sessions was also demonstrated by the flux ratios of the surrounding background sources in the field of view , which hovered around unity ( see figure  [ flux_ratio ] ) .",
    "additional vindication of our results is provided by the flux density measurements of the three pulsars b1750@xmath024 , b1815@xmath014 and b1849 + 00 which could not be determined at 610 mhz using conventional pulsar flux measurement techniques due to their highly scattered profiles .",
    "our flux estimates at 610 mhz for all the three cases are consistent with the pulsar spectra determined from higher frequencies , where interstellar scattering should not affect the measurement ( see figure  [ highdm ] ) .",
    "we now examine the cases of the three other pulsars b1800@xmath021 , b1822@xmath014 and b1823@xmath013 where traditional pulsar flux measurements have been carried out in the past .",
    "all of these sources adjoin interesting environments which may cause an additional absorption at frequencies below 1 ghz .",

    "two of the pulsars , psrs b1822@xmath014 and b1823@xmath013 , were classified by @xcite and @xcite as gps pulsars .",

    "all these objects , together with a number of discrete ultracompact hii regions , compose the w30 complex of peculiar morphology  @xcite , which emits over frequencies ranging from radio to @xmath17-rays .",
    "thus , it is possible that during our interferometric observations the observed psr b1800@xmath021 flux was affected by an additional absorption , which manifested itself at lower frequencies .",
    "such transient absorption may appear due to relative motion of the components of the w30 complex .",
    "one should note that the two standard measurements which yielded higher flux values were separated in time ( by more than 10 years ) and conducted independently using different observing facilities .",
