    "the fe@xmath1(te , se ) series is a quite unique superconducting system : its end member , fese is a superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 k , @xcite which can be increased up to @xmath9 k with the partial substitution of se for te , @xcite or increased all the way up to 36.7 k by the application of hydrostatic pressure.@xcite the other end member of this series fe@xmath1te is not superconducting and instead exhibits a simultaneous structural and magnetic phase transition from tetragonal to monoclinic lattice accompanied by antiferromagnetism ( afm ) near @xmath10 to @xmath11 k ( refs . ) .",
    "this afm structure is distinct from those seen in the undoped feas based compounds.@xcite the afm order in fe@xmath1te propagates along the diagonal direction of the original undistorted fe square lattice @xcite , while in feas the wave - vector of the spin density wave ( sdw ) propagates along the nearest neighbor direction of the original fe square lattice .",
    "@xcite    density functional theory ( dft ) calculations indicate that the fermi surfaces ( fs ) of both fese and fete are similar to those of the other feas based compounds , consequently they should satisfy the nesting condition for the wavevector @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite this apparent lack of universality would seem to question the exclusive role of the interband pairing via @xmath13 magnetic fluctuations in the pairing mechanism for all the iron - based superconductors .",
    "however , the observation of a spin resonance below @xmath14 together with an enhancement of the spin fluctuations near it , indeed suggests a spin - fluctuations mediated superconducting pairing mechanism for this system.@xcite initial angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) measurements in the fe@xmath1te revealed a pair of nearly compensated electron - hole fs pockets , with no evidence for the fs nesting instability associated with @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite this could suggest the possibility of a distinct mechanism for the superconductivity and the magnetic - order in the fe chalcogenides when compared to the fe arsenides .",
    "but a recent arpes study on superconducting fe@xmath15te@xmath16se@xmath17 reveals a holelike and an electronlike fs located at the center and the corner of the brillouin zone , respectively .",
    "these fss are nearly nested for @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite the same study reports an isotropic superconducting gap along the holelike fs with a gap @xmath18 of @xmath19 mev @xmath20 , thus providing evidence for strong - coupling superconductivity .",
    "but , this is in contrast with a recent angle - dependent heat capacity study in fe@xmath1se@xmath21te@xmath22 which finds evidence for a significant gap anisotropy on the electron pockets .",
    "@xcite superconductivity in fe@xmath1se was shown to be extremely sensitive to stoichiometry .",
    "@xcite in the fe@xmath1(te , se ) series , the crystal structure resembles that of the iron arsenides @xcite with the fe square planar sheets forming from the edge - sharing iron chalcogen tetrahedral network .",
    "but it also allows the partial occupation of iron in the interstitial sites of the ( te , se ) layers , resulting in a _ nonstoichiometric _",
    "composition for the fe@xmath1(te , se ) series , where @xmath23 represents the excess fe at the interstitial sites .",
    "@xcite it remains unclear how the geometry of the fs evolves with the incorporation of interstitial fe , but it is claimed to suppress superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    one remarkable feature of these compounds is their extremely large upper critical fields @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , according to ref .",
    "for a fe@xmath25te@xmath26se@xmath27 single - crystal with a middle point @xmath14 of just 11 k , one observes an @xmath28 of @xmath29 t. or for a single - crystal of fe@xmath30te@xmath3se@xmath2 with a @xmath14 close to its optimum value of 14 k one obtains @xmath31 of @xmath32 to 45 t. @xcite compare these values with those of , for instance , mgb@xmath33 single crystals : @xmath34 k with @xmath35 t and @xmath36 t , for fields along the c - axis and along a planar direction , respectively .",
    "@xcite in fact , to achieve in mgb@xmath33 upper - critical fields as large as those observed in the fe@xmath1(te , se ) series , strong impurity scattering is introduced to optimize the relative strengths of intraband scattering in @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands of mgb@xmath33 .",
    "@xcite the significant differences between these two multi - band superconducting families are attributable to the fact that the fe@xmath1(te , se ) superconductors are mostly pauli limited @xcite while the @xmath24s in mgb@xmath33 are mostly determined by the orbital pair - breaking effect . however , the shape of the @xmath6 curves for fe@xmath1(te , se ) series measured in refs . and are quite distinct , with the former presenting a nearly linear dependence of @xmath6 for @xmath39 and the second displaying a pronounced concave down curvature followed by saturation at lower temperatures ( as expected for the pauli limiting effect ) .",
    "such a curvature has also been reported in ref . .",
    "the pauli - limited behavior of @xmath6 for fe - chalcogenides results from the fact that they are semi - metals with rather low carrier density and low fermi energies @xmath40 mev for different fs pockets @xcite , unlike the conventional metallic superconductor mgb@xmath33 . as a result ,",
    "chalcogenides have very short coherence lengths @xmath41 1 nm and thus extremely high orbitally - limited @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fermi velocity in the ab plane , and @xmath44 is the flux quantum .",
    "this in turn greatly enhances the pauli effects quantified by the maki parameter @xmath45 where @xmath46=1.84t_c [ k]$ ] is the clogston paramagnetic limit @xcite .",
    "chalcogenides typically have @xmath47 above the critical value at which the fflo instability develops .",
    "moreover , because of their very short values of @xmath48 , chalcogenides are naturally in the clean limit @xmath49 which is one of the conditions of the fflo instability , where @xmath50 is the mean free path due to elastic impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "these features of chalcogenides make them good candidates to study exotic effects at high magnetic fields , in particular , the interplay of orbital and paramagnetic pairbreaking for multiband pairing and the fflo state at low temperatures .",
    "the small fermi energies also make superconducting properties very sensitive to the doping level , allowing one to tune @xmath24 by small shifts of the chemical potential .",
    "in contrast to other reports emphasizing on the details concerning the synthesis of single crystals @xcite , in this work we compare the high - field phase - diagram of the fe@xmath1(te , se ) series , particularly the diagram for the optimally doped compound fe@xmath1te@xmath51se@xmath52 synthesized by two methods . the first one is based on a traveling - solvent floating zone growth technique ( tsfz ) , which leads to crystals of acceptable crystallinity displaying  non - metallic \" resistivity , optimal @xmath14s , and transition widths @xmath53 to 3 k. we compare their behavior with crystals resulting from the bridgman - stockbarger ( brst ) technique which in our case leads to crystals of poorer crystallinity ( i.e. larger mosaicity ) , wider transitions and frequently to non - optimal @xmath14s in as grown crystals , as previously reported by other groups .",
    "@xcite these last single - crystals were subjected to an annealing procedure which lead to metallic resistivity , considerably sharper resistive transitions @xmath54 k , and to superconducting transitions comparable to those reported in the literature for high quality brst - grown single crystals as measured by squid magnetometry .",
    "@xcite the annealed crystals having a clear metallic behavior preceding superconductivity , display considerably higher upper - critical fields when compared to those showing a poor metallicity , particularly for magnetic - fields applied along the inter - layer direction .",
    "this increase leads to a distinct shape of the @xmath55 , i.e. from a approximately linear in @xmath7 behavior as reported in ref .",
    ", to the marked concave - down curvature followed by saturation at lower temperatures as seen in ref .",
    ".the analysis of our experimental data using a multiband theory of @xmath6 @xcite shows that @xmath6 is indeed strongly pauli limited @xmath56 , predicting the fflo state below @xmath57 k. a detailed single crystal x - ray analysis reveals that the annealing process does not affect the crystallinity or the degree of mosaicity of our single crystals .",
    "nevertheless , our dispersive x - ray analysis indicates that the annealing process leads to a more uniform distribution of interstitial fe .",
    "annealing yields a considerably more isotropic phase diagram which combined with the enhancement in @xmath58 , suggests that the variations in the content of interstitial fe contributes to the suppression of superconductivity .",
    "finally , we show , through a scaling analysis of the fluctuation conductivity in the neighborhood of the superconducting transition , that the superconducting fluctuations in this system are two - dimensional in character .",
    "single crystals of fe@xmath59te@xmath60se@xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 were grown by using the traveling - solvent floating - zone growth technique ( tsfz ) and the bridgman - stockbarger ( brst ) techniques . starting materials with nominal purities of 4n for fe and 5n for te and se were used .",
    "these were handled in an argon - filled glove box which kept the oxygen content below 1ppm .",
    "mixtures of fe , te , and se were ground and pelletized and sealed in quartz ampoules under vacuum and heated at 400 @xmath64c for 24 h. the reacted material was reground and doubly sealed in two quartz ampoules . for samples grown through the tsfz technique ,",
    "the doubly sealed quartz ampoules were loaded into an optical floating - zone furnace ( nec nichiden machinery 15hd ) , equipped with two 1500 w halogen lamps .",
    "the ampoule was rotated at 20 rpm , and translated at a rate of 1 to 2 mm / h .",
    "the as - grown samples were annealed by heating to 800 @xmath64c for 48 h , and then cooled at a rate of 100 @xmath64c / h to 420 @xmath64c and held at this temperature for additional 30 h , followed by the cooling of the furnace to room temperature .",
    "a double wall quartz ampoule was also used in the case of crystals grown by the brst technique .",
    "the inner ampoule was narrowly tipped at its bottom and sealed at the top .",
    "this bridgman ampoule was inserting into a three - zone temperature gradient vertical furnace and lowered at a speed of 4 mm / h .",
    "the growth temperature was decreased at a rate of 3 @xmath64c / h down to 440 @xmath64c and subsequently quenched to room temperature .",
    "some of the crystals as well as se powder were placed into two different quartz crucibles , and both placed inside an evacuated quartz ampoule which was sealed under vacuum and heated slowly to 400 @xmath64c and then annealed for ten days .",
    "the so - obtained crystals were checked by both single - crystal and powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) techniques . from as - grown single crystals ,",
    "shards were cleaved to obtain suitable samples of approximately 0.3 mm @xmath65 0.3 mm @xmath65 0.03 mm .",
    "an oxford - diffraction xcalibur-2 ccd diffractometer with mo k@xmath66 source was used to collect reflections .",
    "crysalis pro 171.33.55 software ( oxford diffraction ) was used for the unit cell refinement and analytical absorption correction .",
    "final structure refinements were conducted using shelxtl . for the powder diffraction runs ,",
    "the single - crystals were ground by hand for approximately 1 minute using an agate mortar and pestle .",
    "patterns were detected by a huber - guinier 620 camera with a rigaku ultrax cu k@xmath66 direct drive rotating anode source .",
    "winpow software was used for unit cell parameter least - squares calculations and peak fitting .",
    "further details are provided in ref . .",
    "scanning electron - microscope energy - dispersive x - ray analysis ( sem - edx ) was performed by using a jeol 5900 scanning electron microscope ( 30 kv accelerating voltage ) equipped with ixrf energy dispersion spectroscopy software ( ixrf systems , inc . ) in order to determine the elemental compositions of the single crystals .",
    "we found that this edx set - up would show a tendency to underestimate by nearly 3 % the overall fraction of fe when comparing with detailed single - crystal x - ray refinements .",
    "we must clarify that the edx set - up was not calibrated against an absolute standard .",
    "longitudinal resistivity was measured using a conventional four - contact method in continuous magnetic fields up to 45 t by using either a ppms or the hybrid magnet of the national high magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical trace of resistivity @xmath67 as a function of the temperature for a single crystal grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone method described above , whose stoichiometry was extracted by a detailed single crystal x - ray analysis refinement .",
    "although the width @xmath68 k of the superconducting transition ( see inset ) is relatively narrow when compared with the width of the transitions shown for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of the metallic state shows the typical negative slope @xmath69 or logarithmic divergence of the resistivity , which was attributed to the high content of interstitial fe and which leads to weak localization .",
    "@xcite the same characteristic temperature dependent resistive behavior is observed also in as - grown samples synthesized by the bridgman - stockbarger method ( red line ) , as seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "2 . as seen",
    ", the as - grown samples tend to exhibit lower superconducting transition temperatures and broader transitions .",
    "the annealing procedure described above leads to a slightly smaller resistivity at room temperature ( black line ) but most importantly to a quite distinct temperature dependence for the resistivity , which below @xmath70 k exhibits a clear metallic dependence with @xmath71 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility on the other hand , shows a very clear diamagnetic signal ( black markers ) below the onset of @xmath14 at @xmath72 k , as seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is virtually temperature independent , as reported in ref . , and",
    "only at low temperatures one observes a very mild upturn in the susceptibility suggesting the presence of a small amount of localized magnetic moments .",
    "although none of the susceptibility traces in ref . show a clear diamagnetic signal below @xmath73 k but below @xmath74 k.    we also characterized our single crystals through single - crystal and powder x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "figure 3 shows two typical powder x - ray spectrum for one _ as - grown _",
    "brst crystal ( black line ) with a nominal stoichiometry fe@xmath30se@xmath2te@xmath3 , and for one _ annealed _ brst single crystal ( red line ) from the same batch .",
    "these  powder \" patterns were produced from integrating the intensities from single - crystal x - ray diffraction measurements using an area detector .",
    "this powder like pattern was obtained on the same single crystals used for the magnetic and transport measurements shown throughout this manuscript , by superimposing several of the @xmath75 to @xmath76 scans along the different crystallographic orientations .",
    "as clearly seen , for both crystals we observe the same set of well - defined bragg peaks , where all peaks can be indexed within the tetragonal unit cell having the space group symmetry _ _",
    "p__4/_nmm_. most importantly , we do not detect the presence of any impurity phase in either crystal , concluding that the annealing process preserves the original crystallographic structure and therefore the stoichiometry of the crystals . from this first analysis",
    "it would seem that both crystals are equivalent in structural quality despite their marked differences in physical behavior as seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "2 .    to clarify if disorder and mosaicity is at the origin of these differences in physical behavior , we performed a detailed x - ray rocking curve analysis in both single crystals around specific bragg peaks .",
    "figure 4 ( a ) shows the ( 200 ) bragg reflection . by fitting the intensity as a function of @xmath76 to a gaussian distribution , one obtains a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath77 , suggesting at first glance a modest but sizeable mosaic spread among crystallites .",
    "however , an exploration of the width of this peak along an arc @xmath78 whose orientation is nearly perpendicular to @xmath79 reveals a very broad feature as seen in fig . 4 ( b )",
    ". this broad maximum can be adjusted ( red line ) to 3 gaussian distributions ( blue lines ) , with one of them showing a fwhm as large as @xmath80 .",
    "each gaussian would represent an ensemble or distribution of crystallites having a similar relative orientation .",
    "the observation of several distributions with varying widths indicates a large degree of mosaicity around the ( 200 ) position , or within the planes . a similar study around the ( 002 ) position shown respectively in figs . 4 ( c ) and 4 ( d ) , reveals seemingly a smaller degree of mosaicity among crystallites within distinct planes .",
    "to clarify if the annealing process affects the structural degrees of freedom , for instance , by releasing strain induced in the single - crystals by the synthesis process , we have attempted a similar detailed structural analysis in an annealed single crystal of fe@xmath1te@xmath3se@xmath2 .",
    "figure 5 ( a ) shows the intensity of the bragg peak located along the ( 200 ) direction as a function of the angle @xmath76 , while fig .",
    "5 ( b ) shows the intensity of the same peak as function of the angle @xmath78 .",
    "the first measurement leads to a gaussian peak ( red line ) having a fwhm of @xmath81 while the second one can be adjusted to two gaussian distributions ( blue lines ) with the widest distribution having a fwhm of @xmath82 .",
    "5 ( c ) shows the intensity of the bragg peak observed as the angle @xmath76 is scanned around the ( 002 ) direction .",
    "one extracts a fwhm of @xmath83 by fitting its intensity to a gaussian distribution ( red line ) . finally , fig . 5 ( d ) shows the intensity of the bragg peak observed at the ( 002 ) position as a function of the angle @xmath78 .",
    "as shown in the figure , to reproduce the observed broad feature one would need to fit it to at least three gaussian distributions with the widest one having a fwhm of @xmath84 .    from this detailed comparison between the as - grown and the annealed brst fe@xmath1te@xmath3se@xmath2 single crystals",
    ", we can firmly conclude that the annealing process has no or perhaps just a marginal effect on the degree of crystallinity of the brst grown samples .",
    "although as seen in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , the behavior of the metallic state , and even the width of the superconducting transition is affected by this treatment and as we shall see below , it also affects @xmath6 . in figs .",
    "6 ( a ) through ( d ) we show a similar rocking curve analysis for a typical tsfz fe@xmath1te@xmath22se@xmath21 single - crystal , and as can clearly be seen in figs . 6 ( b ) and ( c )",
    "the degree of mosaicity in this single crystal , is higher ( spans over @xmath85 ) than what we found for the brst crystals .",
    "nevertheless , the width of the superconducting transition ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is considerably sharper than the width of the transition in as grown brst crystals ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) therefore , from our study we can state that the mosaicity , or the relative orientation between stacked planes in a single - crystal , has virtually no effect on the superconducting properties ( such as the width of the transition ) of the 11 series",
    ".    nevertheless , by comparing the edx data taken on several annealed and non - annealed brst - grown single - crystals , on approximately a dozen of collection sites in each crystal , one notices marked differences between annealed and non - annealed crystals : in average the non - annealed crystals displayed a variability @xmath86 of @xmath87 % in the fraction @xmath23 of interstitial fe and a @xmath88 % in the fraction @xmath89 of se , when compared respectively to @xmath90 % and @xmath91 % for the annealed samples ( @xmath86 is the average of the fluctuations with respect to the average value of @xmath23 ) .",
    "edx indicates that the annealing process has virtually no effect on the average value of either @xmath89 or @xmath23 , so it just homogenizes both values ( specially @xmath23 ) throughout the sample .",
    "however , this observation does not address the origin of for instance , the  non - metallic \" like resistivity observed in the tsfz - grown crystals when compared to the metallic response seen in annealed brst - grown crystals .",
    "for the first ones , we were able to observe clear bragg peaks and proceed with single - crystal x - ray refinements in shards taken from them , indicating relatively large values for @xmath23 ranging from 0.07 to 0.12 .",
    "the crystallographic information file for one of our single - crystals is available as supplemental material @xcite .",
    "we also performed edx analysis on the tsfz single crystals , finding similar amounts of excess interstitial fe , and typical values for @xmath92 % .",
    "remarkably , for the second ones and despite the physical characterization shown above suggesting relatively high - quality single - crystals , we were unable to extract well - defined integrated intensities to proceed with single - crystal x - ray refinements .",
    "for these crystals , edx indicates nearly stoichiometric values for @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath93 although , as previously mentioned , it tends to underestimate the content of fe when compared to single - crystal x - ray refinements .",
    "these observations indicate that the physical properties of the 11 fe - chalcogenides are nearly oblivious to their degree of mosaicity but depend on the amount of interstitial fe and on how evenly distributed it is throughout the sample .",
    "in this section we compare the high - field superconducting phase - diagrams of several crystals synthesized by either the floating zone or the bridgman - stockbarger technique . in each case , only the crystals displaying the sharpest superconducting transitions @xmath94 k ( where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the values of the resistivity at respectively , the onset of the resistive transition or 90 % of @xmath67 , and the foot or 10 % of @xmath67 at the transition ) were chosen for the electrical transport measurements under high fields . as indicated by fig .",
    "2 , for the crystals grown by brst the method , only the annealed samples showed the optimum @xmath14 and the sharpest superconducting transitions among all of the measured samples .",
    "figures 7 ( a ) and ( b ) show the resistance as a function of temperature for an annealed fe@xmath1te@xmath3se@xmath2 single crystal for different fields @xmath97 and @xmath39 , respectively . clearly , fields along the _ c_-axis produce broader transitions as a function of temperature .",
    "figures 7 ( c ) and ( d ) show the resistance as a function of magnetic fields @xmath98 and @xmath39 ( up to @xmath0 t ) for the same single crystal for different temperatures .",
    "the transitions become progressively sharper in field as the temperature decreases , consistent with the reduction of vortex fluctuations at lower @xmath7 .",
    "we have also collected similar data - sets for several single - crystals grown by the tsfz - method with different se and fe contents but the corresponding raw data is not shown here .",
    "the stoichiometric fractions of fe and se were determined through a detailed single - crystal x - ray diffraction refinement of small shards cleaved off from each single - crystal . for these tsfz samples the measured superconducting transition temperatures ranged from @xmath99 k ( @xmath100 , @xmath89 or fraction of se = 0.16 ) to the optimal @xmath14 value @xmath101 k ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) .    in fig .",
    "8 ( a ) we compare the superconducting phase - diagram at high - fields for our annealed brst fe@xmath1te@xmath3se@xmath2 single - crystal ( circles ) with the results of ref .",
    "( squares ) , and in fig .",
    "8 ( b ) with the phase - diagram obtained for several tsfz single - crystals ( various markers excluding circles ) . here , all points correspond to the middle point of the resistive transition . in either graph , both the field- and the temperature - axis",
    "are re - scaled with the zero - field @xmath14 of each sample ( corresponding to the middle point of the zero - field resistive transition ) .",
    "here , we use this scaling for comparative purposes only , and not to indicate that these compounds are placed within the dirty limit . the plot in fig . 7 ( a )",
    "leads to a similar scaling quality when compared with a @xmath104 as a function of @xmath105 plot , previously observed in some of the fe arsenide compounds @xcite and which was deemed to be consistent with an effective clean limit scenario due to the small superconducting coherence lengths of the fe - pnictide compounds .",
    "as clearly seen in both figures , the annealed brst - grown crystal has considerably larger upper - critical fields than all the other crystals , particularly for fields along the @xmath106-axis and at intermediary reduced temperatures , i.e. from @xmath29 to @xmath107 % larger @xmath24s for @xmath108 . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the upper - critical field still is @xmath110 % larger than the value reported in ref . .",

    "another intriguing observation is that the superconducting phase - diagram for the more fe stoichiometric samples shows a pronounced downward curvature as @xmath7 is lowered which was attributed by several authors to the pauli limiting effect @xcite , in contrast with for example , the linear dependence seen in ref . ) for @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , all @xmath120 ratios shown in fig . 7 are above the bcs paramagnetic limit , @xmath121 , indicating that the pauli pairbreaking is very essential .      in order to evaluate the contributions of both orbital and pauli pairbreaking effects for either field orientation , and to compare the results with those extracted from heat capacity measurements ,",

    "if the quasiparticles are confined within the lowest landau level , the transport of charge carriers becomes nearly one - dimensional along the direction of the applied field .",
    "fluctuation effects close to the superconducting transition are expected to be enhanced by the lower effective dimensionality of the system . in the critical regime",
    "the fluctuation conductivity was calculated in ref . by including a quartic term in the free energy within the hartree approximation , and obtained a scaling law for the fluctuation conductivity @xmath242 in magnetic fields , in terms of unspecified scaling functions @xmath243 and @xmath244 , valid for two - dimensional and three - dimensional superconductors , @xcite respectively : @xmath245 @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 are characteristic constants of a specific material .",

    ", this two - dimensional scaling clearly succeeds in collapsing all the curves over an extended temperature range particularly above @xmath14 .",
    "we checked that this statement is still valid if the onset of the resistive transition ( 90 % of the resistance of the normal state ) is used as the criteria to define @xmath14 .",
    "given that the high field resistive transitions shown in fig .",
    "7 are remarkably broad , it is not possible to unambiguously define the functional form of @xmath256 in order to also collapse those curves in fig .",
    "11 . to compare this two - dimensional scaling relation with the three - dimensional one , in the right panel of fig .",
    "11 , we plot @xmath257 versus @xmath255 /(th)^{2/3}$ ] as expected for the three - dimensional case described by eq .",
    "( [ 3d ] ) .",
    "clearly , the two - dimensional relationship provides a better scaling of the data both above and below @xmath14 . indeed , in the three - dimensional case",
    ", the curves at different fields open like a fan above @xmath14 and also tend to separate from each other below this critical temperature . on the other hand , in the 2d case , the curves above 4 t basically overlap over the entire range .",
    "the 2d behavior of fluctuation conductivity , already observed in the fe arsenides , @xcite implies that the inter - plane coherence length @xmath258 is smaller or in the order of the inter - plane spacing as found above , or , equivalently , that the coupling between adjacent superconducting planes is smaller than the intra - plane condensation energy .",
    "notice , that our scaling analysis is consistent with the report of very anisotropic superconducting fluctuations according to heat capacity measurements @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional scaling also suggests that such fluctuations contribute to the broad transitions seen in fig .",
    "7 , which become considerably sharper at lower temperatures .",
    "there are several puzzling aspects in the fe@xmath1te@xmath116se@xmath259 family that have yet to be understood and/or conciliated .",
    "for instance , optical spectroscopy measurements in fe@xmath260te@xmath261s@xmath262 indicates the absence of a drude peak in optical conductivity , suggesting the absence of well - defined coherent quasi - particles in this material @xcite .",
    "although , for fese@xmath263te@xmath264 the in - plane optical conductivity is found to be indeed describable within a drude - lorentz model @xcite but with an incoherent response along the inter - planar direction @xcite .",
    "therefore , one could even ask if the concept of fermi surface would be applicable to these compounds . in sharp contrast , a recent angle resolved photoemission study on fese@xmath263te@xmath264 @xcite reveals a fermi surface which is in relative good qualitative agreement with the generic fermi surface proposed for the family of fe pnictides .",
    "namely , composed by two concentric hole - like cylindrical surfaces at the @xmath265 point and two electron - like cylinders at the _ m _ point of the brillouin zone , which are characterized by a large , fs - sheet dependent , effective - mass enhancement .",
    "this indicates that correlations are particularly relevant for these materials which is consistent with the size of the anomaly observed in the heat capacity at the superconducting transition @xcite or the large @xmath24 reported here and by other groups @xcite",
    ". this geometry would be consistent with the observation of a resonance mode characterized by a wave - vector connecting both types of cylindrical fermi surfaces @xcite pointing towards an itinerant , nesting - like mechanism for the origin of the spin - fluctuations in these systems .",
    "although , this scenario seems difficult to conciliate with the rather large magnetic moment of 1.6 to 1.8 @xmath266 for the non - interstitial fe(i ) ion as extracted from careful magnetic susceptibility measurements in _ superconducting _ samples @xcite , and does not explain the observation of short - range magnetic - order in ( superconducting samples ) for the same wave - vector as the one extracted for the magnetically ordered state of fe@xmath1te @xcite .",
    "the interstitial fe(ii ) is presumably characterized by an even larger moment of @xmath267 2.5 @xmath266 @xcite and from the superconducting perspective it should act as a magnetic impurity .",
    "a recent dft + dmft study suggests that a combination of hund s rule and structural degrees of freedom , such as the pnictogen height and the bond angle between fe and the pnictide element , are the key parameters defining the role of correlations , i.e. the degree of localization and therefore the concomitant size of the magnetic moment of fe in iron pnictide compounds @xcite .",
    "for instance ,",
    "the larger the size of the pnictogen atom or equivalently the larger the distance between fe and this element , or the greater the deviation with respect to the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5@xmath64 , the larger the degree of localization in the fe site . or equivalently , the stronger the correlations on those fermi surface sheets having a marked @xmath268 character which would favor the development of a magnetic instability .",
    "it is therefore easy to speculate on the role played by the interstitial fe(ii ) : it should favor local lattice distortions that are likely to further distort the fe - pnictogen angle away from 109.5@xmath64 favoring local magnetism in detriment of superconductivity .",
    "the larger the content in fe(ii ) the stronger this detrimental effect , while larger fluctuations in @xmath23 could create randomly distributed nearly magnetic patches having a stronger fe(ii ) content which could lead to pair - breaking effects .",
    "this rather simple scenario would explain why the annealed brst - grown samples display clearer and sharper superconducting transitions when compared to the non - annealed ones despite a similarly poor crystallinity .",
    "as for the presence of the fflo state @xcite , it is presumably sensitive to impurities being difficult to conciliate with the presence of magnetic fe(ii ) atoms .",
    "however , our results suggest that our brst - grown samples ( annealed as well as non - annealed ) are closer to having a nearly stoichiometric fe content .",
    "furthermore , the low-@xmath7 upturn in @xmath55 indicative of the fflo instability as observed in this work , was also observed by other groups , see for example , ref . . finally ,",
    "the interplay between magnetism and the fflo - state is still poorly understood @xcite , so its existence in the fe@xmath1te@xmath116se@xmath259 will only be clarified by future calorimetric , magnetic torque or nmr measurements at high fields .    finally , given that the inter - plane coherence length @xmath258 is in the order of the inter - planar distance it is relatively easy to understand why the mosaic spread associated with relative orientation among fe[se , te ] planes has little effect on the superconducting properties of these materials .",
    "although the superconducting anisotropy is small , the size of @xmath258 implies that the cooper pairs are virtually localized within the planes thus remaining almost oblivious to the potential pair - breaking effects imposed by the grain boundaries located between the planes .",
    "in conclusion , we find that the fe[te , se ] planes are well stacked along the c - axis , forming domains with well aligned planes spanning a certain coherence length along the c - axis .",
    "these domains display a small twist to each other , in the order of a degree or less relative , defining grain boundaries .",
    "our study strongly indicates that these domain boundaries have little or no effect on the superconducting properties of the fe@xmath1te@xmath116se@xmath117 series .",
    "however , a relatively weak disorder in the distribution of interstitial fe is found to be detrimental to the superconducting properties of the fe@xmath1te@xmath116se@xmath259 series , broadening the width of the superconducting transition and suppressing the diamagnetic response .",
    "we attribute this to local lattice distortions associated with the interstitial fe(ii ) which are likely to locally increase the electronic correlations leading to a higher degree of carrier localization favoring magnetism in detriment of superconductivity . in samples displaying the sharpest superconducting transitions and a very clear diamagnetic signal , we observe a mild upturn in the upper critical field at lower temperatures consistent with the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov instability .",
    "these samples display metallic resistivity suggesting also the formation of coherent quasi - particles at lower temperatures in contrast to previous reports @xcite , and implying that a relatively mild excess of randomly distributed fe(ii ) atoms may be enough to suppress the phase coherence .",
    "finally , our estimates of the inter - plane coherence length @xmath269  where @xmath270 6  is the inter - planar lattice constant , is consistent with the quasi - two - dimensional superconducting fluctuations in the critical region ( also observed by other groups@xcite ) .",

    "<S> we compare the superconducting phase - diagram under high magnetic fields ( up to @xmath0 t ) of fe@xmath1se@xmath2te@xmath3 single crystals originally grown by the bridgman - stockbarger ( brst ) technique , which were annealed to display narrow superconducting transitions and the optimal transition temperature @xmath4 k , with the diagram for samples of similar stoichiometry grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone technique as well as with the phase - diagram reported for crystals grown by a self - flux method . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the so - annealed samples tend to display higher ratios @xmath5 , particularly for fields applied along the inter - planar direction , where the upper critical field @xmath6 exhibits a pronounced downward curvature followed by saturation at lower temperatures @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this last observation is consistent with previous studies indicating that this system is pauli limited . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of our @xmath6 data using a multiband theory suggests the emergence of the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchnikov state at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed structural x - ray analysis , reveals no impurity phases but an appreciable degree of mosaicity in as - grown brst single - crystals which remains unaffected by the annealing process . </S>",
    "<S> energy - dispersive x - ray analysis showed that the annealed samples have a more homogeneous stoichiometric distribution of both fe and se with virtually the same content of interstitial fe as the non - annealed ones . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the excess of fe , in contrast to structural disorder , contributes to decrease the superconducting upper - critical fields of this series . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a scaling analysis of the fluctuation conductivity in the superconducting critical regime , suggests that the superconducting fluctuations have a two - dimensional character in this system . </S>"
