    "precise measurements of matter power spectrum in the large - scale structure are a powerful tool not only to investigate the details of the structure formation , but also to estimate the cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , the precise measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum observed by the sloan digital sky survey has emerged as a powerful tool to estimate cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "also the observation of cosmic shear in the near future is expected to give a useful constraint on the nature of dark energy .",
    "obviously , proper understanding of the observed power spectrum becomes possible only if an accurate theoretical prediction is available which requires a good understanding of the non - linear evolution of dark matter perturbation , the relation between dark matter and baryonic matter ( bias effect ) and the redshift distortion effect .",
    "there have been various studies and much progress on the theoretical calculations of the power spectrum , but it is still useful and required to have more accurate theoretical treatment . in this paper , we give a new approach to describe the non - linear evolution of dark matter .",
    "it is called the `` wiener hermite ( wh ) expansion method '' , where the stochastic nature of the cosmological density perturbation is manifestly used and the stochastic variables are expanded in terms of an orthonormal basis in the space of stochastic functions .",
    "the method was developed in the 1970s for application to turbulent theory in fluid dynamics and applied to cosmological turbulent theory by one of the authors of this paper .",
    "the method gives us a coupled equation at each perturbative order , even at the first order in such a way that the lower order quantities are modified by higher order quantities .",
    "this is totally different from the usual perturbation theory where lower order quantities are never influenced by higher order quantities .",
    "thus , it gives us a prescription for the renormalization of higher order effects , and the precise meaning is described below .",
    "each expansion coefficient has a clear statistical meaning ; namely , the coefficients of the first , second and third terms in the expansion express the amplitude of gaussianity , the skewness and kurtosis , respectively .",
    "thus each term corresponds directly to an appropriate @xmath8-point correlation function .",
    "we mention here some details on the previous approaches relation to ours .",
    "it has been known for some time that the standard perturbation theory ( spt ) of cosmological perturbation can be analytically solved in the einstein - de sitter universe in integral forms @xcite . when it is considered up to the third order in spt ( 1-loop level ) ,",
    "the analytical predictions describe the nonlinearity well at sufficiently high redshifts @xcite",
    ". however , the predictions are still insufficient at the observable low redshifts ( @xmath9 0  3 ) , and we need to consider further non - linear effects .",
    "furthermore , it is computationally expensive to deal with the higher order corrections in spt .",
    "therefore , various modification of spt have been proposed in the past .",
    "one of the main approach is the `` renormalized perturbation theory '' ( rpt ; @xcite ) , where the basic equations for fluid describing matter perturbation are rewritten in a convenient compact form in order to use a diagrammatic technique developed in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "further modification have been considered , such as , e.g. , the `` closure theory '' @xcite , the `` time renormalization group '' approach @xcite , and the `` @xmath0-expansion approach '' using multi - point propagators @xcite .",
    "many other new methods have also been studied @xcite . on the other hand , there is also an approach to the large - scale structure in the framework of the lagrangian picture , called `` lagrangian resummation theory '' ( lrt ; @xcite ) .",
    "it will be shown that our approach is mathematically equivalent to the @xmath0-expansion approach , but it still has the features described above and gives us a very convenient expression for the matter power spectrum described below . in almost all modified perturbation theories ,",
    "the resummation of nonlinear effects , which means the partial summation of the infinite order in spt , is considered .",
    "this implies that any modified perturbative expansion methods should be described in the context of spt . in this paper",
    ", we use only spt , and prove again various properties of cosmological perturbations , e.g. , their behavior in the small - scale limit ( high-@xmath1 limit ) proved in the context of rpt @xcite .",
    "since low-@xmath1 solutions can be safely computed using spt , the derivation of more precise solutions of cosmological perturbations by interpolating between the 1-loop results and the high-@xmath1 behavior @xcite has been attempted .",
    "however , some arbitrariness have remained for this prescription . to resolve this problem",
    ", we propose a unique interpolation between the low-@xmath1 solutions and the high-@xmath1 ones by assuming that the higher order solutions in perturbation theory are well approximated by the ones in the high-@xmath1 limit .",
    "then , we precisely compute only up to 1-loop level corrections in spt and replace the higher order corrections with the ones calculated in the high-@xmath1 limit . in this way we obtain an approximate full power spectrum , and",
    "the power spectrum shows a very good agreement with @xmath2-body results up to rather high-@xmath1 ( about @xmath10 0.20.4 @xmath11mpc@xmath12 ) within 1 % or 2 % accuracy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first explain the stochastic properties which should be satisfied by the density and velocity perturbations of dark matter . in section 3 , we briefly review spt , which will be used later",
    ". then the wh expansion technique is explained in our context in section 4 .",
    "the relationship between spt and the wh expansion method is established there , and we also show the mathematical equivalence between the wh expansion and the @xmath0-expansion . in section 5 , we prove again the high-@xmath1 limit behavior of the cosmological perturbations in the context of spt and propose an approximate full power spectrum , where the lower order corrections are calculated only up to 1-loop levels in spt and the higher order corrections are replaced with the high-@xmath1 solutions . in section 6 ,",
    "we compare our result with some other analytic predictions and @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "we compute the two - point correlation function in section 7 .",
    "we summarize our work and discuss future works in section 8 .",
    "after decoupling , baryon and dark matter fluctuations are tightly coupled by the gravitational force , and the evolution can then be described by pressureless fluid equations ( continuity equation and euler equation ) with the poisson equation for the newton gravity .",
    "thus our basic equations are as follows @xcite : @xmath13 = 0 , \\notag \\\\       & \\frac{\\partial { \\mathbf{v}}}{\\partial t } + { \\mathbf{v}}\\cdot \\nabla { \\mathbf{v}}= -\\nabla \\phi , \\notag \\\\       & \\nabla^2 \\phi + \\lambda c^2 = 4 \\pi g \\rho ,          \\label{ori}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote the mass density , velocity and gravitational potential , respectively , and @xmath17 is the cosmological constant .    when we transform the spatial coordinates as @xmath18 and redefine the velocity as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the scale factor and @xmath21 is the peculiar velocity , we can express eq .",

    "the peculiar velocity @xmath21 has no background part because of rotation symmetry in the average sense .",
    "therefore , the perturbative part of the mass density and the peculiar velocity has the property that their ensemble average are zero by definition : @xmath34    averaging the above set of equations , we obtain the following background equations . @xmath35 @xmath36 integrating eq .",

    "we neglected the vorticity @xmath44 because the vorticity is zero if its initial value is zero , and even if its initial value is non - zero , it decays due to the expansion of the universe . the functions @xmath45 @xmath46 encode the nonlinearity of the evolution and satisfy the conditions @xmath47    note that this decomposition between background and perturbation is exact in newtonian gravity , namely there are no backreaction terms generated from the ensemble average in newtonian gravity , and the perturbative parts @xmath48 and @xmath49 obeying eqs .",

    "( [ stochastic ] ) : @xmath50 . more specifically , when the solutions for nonlinear equations are expanded perturbatively , the property that their ensemble averages are zero is not guaranteed in general , and thus a redefinition of the perturbation variables such as @xmath51 is necessary .",
    "in the case of cosmological spt , the average , such as @xmath52 being proportional to @xmath53 , is interpreted as the vacuum bubble diagram in the diagrammatical picture and contributes only in infinitely large scales .",

    "<S> we apply the wiener hermite ( wh ) expansion to the non - linear evolution of the large - scale structure , and obtain an approximate expression for the matter power spectrum in the full order of the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows us to expand any random function in terms of an orthonormal basis in the space of random functions in such a way that the first order of the expansion expresses gaussian distribution , and others are the deviation from the gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that the wh expansion is mathematically equivalent to the @xmath0-expansion approach in the renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> while exponential behavior in the high-@xmath1 limit has been proved for the mass density and velocity fluctuations of dark matter in the rpt , we prove the behavior again in the context of the wh expansion using the result of the standard perturbation theory ( spt ) . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new approximate expression for the matter power spectrum which interpolates the low-@xmath1 expression corresponding to the 1-loop level in spt and the high-@xmath1 expression obtained by taking a high-@xmath1 limit of the wh expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of our prescription is specifically verified by comparing with the 2-loop solutions of spt . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed power spectrum agrees with the result of @xmath2-body simulation with accuracy better than @xmath3 or @xmath4 in a range of the baryon acoustic oscillation scales , where the wave number is about @xmath1 = 0.20.4 @xmath5 at @xmath6@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this accuracy is comparable to or slightly less than the ones in the closure theory , the fractional difference of which from the @xmath2-body result is within @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> one merit of our method is that the computational time is very short because only single and double integrals are involved in our solution . </S>"
