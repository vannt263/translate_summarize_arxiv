    "the hanbury - brown twiss ( hbt ) effect is a staple of multi - particle interferometry , with broad applications in experimental physics @xcite .",
    "it is generally considered that indistinguishability of particles is a central requirement for multi - particle interference , but recently two of us proposed a generalization of hbt that allows for the interference of distinguishable particles @xcite .",
    "interference between potentially distinguishable particles can be observed by a using detection apparatus that does not , at a fundamental quantum mechanical level , distinguish the particles : a procedure we have called  entanglement enabled intensity interferometry \" ( e@xmath0i@xmath0 ) @xcite .    to enable interference between photons of different wavelength ,",
    "it is not enough that the detector fail to read out the wavelength of an incoming photon .",
    "rather , the detector must reach the same final quantum state in response to photons of either wavelength . to achieve that goal",
    ", one must exploit appropriate projections and/or entanglement between the incoming particles and the detector . in this paper",
    ", we explore several methods involving nonlinear crystals , coherent pumps , and filters to demonstrate intensity interferometry with photons of different wavelengths .",
    "our methods potentially have applications in several fields , notably including astronomy and fluorescence microscopy , in which one might profit from improved resolution among sources with different spectral characteristics .",
    "nonlinear optical properties of crystals figure centrally in our practical proposals .",
    "frequency upconversion and downconversion are forms of three - wave mixing in which the frequency of a photon is changed while its other quantum properties ( including phase information ) are preserved @xcite . in these processes ,",
    "an input photon as well as a coherent state ( referred to as the pump ) interact in the nonlinear crystal in such a way that the frequency of the input photon is altered while a pump photon is created or annihilated , conserving energy .",
    "quantum frequency upconversion has been used to bring the wavelength of a photon into a region where detectors are very efficient @xcite , while quantum frequency downconversion may be used to convert photons from a wavelength convenient for information processing to a wavelength that is convenient for transmission @xcite .    the possibility to perform frequency conversion on sources of different wavelength , thus producing indistinguishable photons which subsequently interfere , has been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "this was achieved in the context of the hong - ou - mandel dip , where two photons of different wavelength were both upconverted before arriving simultaneously at a beamsplitter @xcite .",
    "the quality of the resulting interference quantifies the success of the upconversion and its ability to preserve phase information .",
    "it is even possible to combine frequency conversion and beamsplitting into a single step @xcite . in hbt",
    ", two detectors can receive photons from either of two distinct sources .",
    "the inability of the detectors to determine which photons come from which source is a necessary condition for two - photon interference .",
    "if the sources emit distinguishable photons , it becomes possible to determine which photons were emitted from which source .",
    "if our detectors are capable of making that determination , then interference becomes impossible .",
    "in many applications of interferometry , one only has access to light from a particular source after it has been spatially mixed with light from other sources . to address such applications",

    "consider the setup displayed in fig . [ fig : hbtgeometry ] .",
    "we have two sources , labeled @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which emit red and blue photons , respectively . at the other end of the setup , we have two detectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the propagator ( i.e. , transition amplitude ) from 1 to @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath5 , and the other propagators for source - detector combinations are defined similarly . temporarily neglecting the possible difference in arrival times for simplicity ,",
    "suppose that each source emits a photon that propagates towards the detectors .",
    "then the probability of coincidence between the two detectors is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the state of the system when a red photon is absorbed by detector a and a blue photon is absorbed by detector b , with @xmath8 defined similarly .",

    "this corresponds to computing @xmath14 and then renormalizing the state to obtain @xmath15 in this situation the probability of coincidence , given that the blue photons have successfully passed through the filter , becomes @xmath16 which contains the interference term @xmath17 .",
    "from this toy model , it becomes clear that if we want to recover the interference term , our task is to design a detection apparatus which implements the unitary @xmath12 on incoming light and then applies the applies the appropriate filter . in particular , we would like @xmath12 to allow for the possibility that each of two different wavelengths can be converted to a common wavelength without changing the other properties of the light . in the next section , we provide a description of how to implement such a unitary .",
