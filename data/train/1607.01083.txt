    "a successful formulation of a quantum theory of gravity , and its possible unification with the other fundamental interactions of nature , remains as one of the foremost challenges of theoretical physics . while various promising approaches for a quantum gravity ( qg ) theory have been proposed , such as superstring theory , loop quantum gravity etc .",
    ", there has not been a single experiment or observation to our knowledge , which clearly supports or refutes any theory . on the other hand ,",
    "no experiment or observation has shown any deviation from the present theory of gravity .",
    "although this is normally attributed to the immensity of , and the related difficulty of directly accessing the planck energy scale ( e@xmath0 tev ) , there are indications that current experimental accuracies and those in the near future may be sufficient to detect such experimental signatures in at least some laboratory based experiments .    in the last couple of decades , it has been shown that most theories of qg predict momentum dependent modifications of the position - momentum commutation relation , and the consequent modifications of the heisenberg s uncertainty principle ( hup ) and existence of a minimum measurable length near the planck scale @xcite . studies of the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) showed modifications in several areas of quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "for example , modifications are expected for the hamiltonian describing a minimal coupling with an electromagnetic field , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this result was then used to show modification of the landau levels @xcite .",
    "it is possible to show that gup affects also lamb shift , the case of a potential step and of a potential barrier , a quantum configuration used in scanning tunnelling microscopes @xcite , the case of a particle in a box @xcite , showing that the length of the box is quantized when a gup is considered , and the energy levels for a simple harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "it has also been showed that gup can also be detected considering its effects on quantum optical system @xcite .",
    "carrying forward this program , in this article , we compute qg corrections to an important theoretical as well as experimental area of quantum mechanics , namely the angular momentum of elementary quantum systems , and their experimental applications .",
    "we indeed show that there are potential measurable planck scale effects to well - understood phenomena such as line spectra from the hydrogen - atom , the stern - gerlach experiment , larmor frequency and clebsh - gordan coefficients .",
    "several models were proposed in the past years to account for this modification of the heisenberg principle . a quadratic model , for example , proposed in @xcite , can account for this feature by adding a term quadratic in the momentum in the position - momentum commutation relation . in what follows , we will consider the most general commutation relation correct up to second order in momentum @xcite",

    "we see now that the gup - corrected spectrum depends not only on the principal quantum number , but also on the expectation values of the electron s momentum , as well as its angular momentum quantum numbers ( the latter as we know also happens for the relativistic hydrogen atom ) .",
    "since a magnetic field interacts with the angular momentum of an atom via its magnetic moment , we expect that gup modifications of the angular momentum theory will result in a modification of this interaction and have observable consequences . in what follows we will consider atoms with only one electron in an s shell ( @xmath106 ) and all other levels being filled .",
    "examples for these kind of atoms are those of the first group of the periodic table and the elements in the group of copper .",
    "this may allow us to test the direct consequences of gup on angular momenta studying its effects on the electronic spin .",
    "we assume the spin operators to satisfy the same modified algebra for the angular momentum , ( [ eqn : generalized_commutator_ang_mom ] ) and the same `` low energy '' expansion ( [ eqn : ang_mom_henergy_lenergy ] ) .",
    "the magnetic moment of an electron is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the bohr magneton , @xmath109 is the electron g - factor and @xmath110 is the spin operator",

    "less than @xmath113 t @xcite , the quadrupole term appearing in the hamiltonian for the magnetic interaction on an atomic system is negligible with respect the dipole term .",
    "therefore , we can write the hamiltonian considering only a term involving the scalar product between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field itself @xmath114 using ( [ eqn : henergy_lenergy ] ) and ( [ eqn : mag_mom_henergy_lenergy ] ) , we can rewrite this relation in terms of low - energy quantities @xmath115 looking at the second term , _",

    "we replace @xmath22 and @xmath100 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . in this way",

    "first we consider a uniform magnetic field along the @xmath124-axis , with the atom moving along the @xmath127-axis .",
    "( [ eqn : se_spin ] ) for each component of the spinor can therefore be written as    @xmath128    from which one can find the modified larmor frequency of the system @xmath129 furthermore , since the magnitude of the linear momentum is not changed by the magnetic field , we can obtain the same form for the equations of motion as found in the standard theory @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
