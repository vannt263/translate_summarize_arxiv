    "the realization of ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices has made a large range of fundamental equilibrium and dynamical phenomena of degenerate quantum gases experimentally accessible .",
    "the success of this approach stems from the fact that , in contrast to analogous condensed matter systems , optical lattices form a defect free lattice potential which can trap a dense cloud of atoms with long decoherence times and can be controlled rapidly with a great deal of flexibility .",
    "this has already enabled a seminal demonstration of the superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi ) transition by greiner _",
    "et al _ @xcite that was predicted to occur for a clean realization of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , other themes of ultracold - atom research have been explored experimentally such as the purely one - dimensional ( 1d ) tonks - girardeau limit @xcite , the characterization of the sf - mi transition via the excitation spectrum through 1d - 3d dimensionality crossover @xcite , and impurity effects caused by bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "here we focus on features of the excitation spectrum from reference @xcite which were revealed for a 1d bhm by periodic modulation of the lattice depth .",
    "the experimental accessibility of the excitation spectrum provides a rich source of additional information that can be compared with well studied quantities such as the dynamic structure factor @xcite .",
    "in addition to this the experiment demonstrates the transition through the evolution of the spectrum from discrete sharp resonances in the mi regime to a broad continuum of excitations in the sf regime .",
    "changes in the structure of the excitation spectrum provide important evidence for the transition beyond the loss and revival of phase coherence when ramping the lattice @xcite , and can also be used to diagnose the temperature of the system @xcite .",
    "the 1d system is of particular interest for several reasons .",
    "firstly , quantum fluctuations are expected to play a strong role there @xcite , and this is indeed found to be the case with the critical ratio of the on - site interaction to kinetic energy @xmath1 , identified by the appearance of the discrete structure in the spectrum , being lower than that predicted by mean field theory @xcite .",
    "secondly , the behavior found in the 1d experiment for the sf regime , specifically a large and broad non - zero response , most strikingly departs from standard theoretical predictions .",
    "specifically , linear response using bogoliubov theory for a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a shallow 1d optical lattice predicts that lattice modulation can not excite the gas in the sf regime due to the phonon nature of the excitation spectrum @xcite .",
    "since the quantum depletion of the sf in the experiment was significant ( @xmath2% ) , it has been suggested that this was responsible for the response @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that only a small amount of seed depletion is required for non - linear effects like the parametric amplification of bogoliubov modes to reproduce the sf response @xcite .",
    "more recently still , the use of the sine - gordon model and bosonization method has demonstrated that linear response is non - zero at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "lastly , the study of the 1d system permits the use of quasi - exact numerical methods , such as the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm , where the fully time - dependent dynamical evolution of the system can be computed efficiently for systems of equivalent size to those in the experiment .",
    "in addition to the many - body physics perspective , understanding the excitation spectrum revealed in @xcite is important for potential applications of the mi state .",
    "the zero particle number fluctuations for an ideal commensurate mi state make them attractive candidates for several applications , most notably as a quantum memory , a basis for quantum computing  @xcite , and quantum simulations of many - body quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "a well understood excitation spectrum can give valuable information about the nature and stability of the experimental approximation of the ideal mi state to external perturbations .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of the 1d bhm under lattice modulation and generate excitation spectra for box and harmonic trapping of a large system over numerous lattice depths ranging from the sf to mi regime .",
    "we find that much of the features of the box system can be understood from a small exact calculation .",
    "however , the large system calculations were crucial for the investigation of signatures in the spectrum which indicate the transition from mi to sf regime in both trappings .",
    "we find that for a harmonically trapped system with less than unit filling the spectrum is similar to the commensurately filled box , but with the transition producing less pronounced signatures .",
    "additional calculations progressing from the mi regime for a harmonically trapped system with a central filling greater than unity produces a spectra that has very good qualitatively agreement with the experiment . in this way",
    "our results are different but complementary to a very recent study of the same experiment by kollath _",
    "et al _ @xcite where they discovered that excitation spectra can reveal information about the commensurateness of the system .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : we give an overview of the physical setup for the 1d system in section [ model ] followed by a description of the excitation scheme in section [ excite ] .",
    "we then introduce the linear response formalism for this scheme in section [ lineartheory ] , and in section [ numerics ] we give an overview of the literature describing the tebd simulation method used here for the larger systems .",
    "the results are then presented in section [ results ] , firstly for a small box system computed exactly in section [ small ] , then for larger systems computed with the tebd algorithm for box and harmonic trapping in section [ large ] and [ trapped ] respectively .",
    "we then end with the conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "in the experiment @xcite effective 1d systems were formed from an anisotropic 3d optical lattice loaded with ultra - cold bosonic atoms @xcite .",
    "this is done by adiabatically exposing a bec to far - off resonance standing wave laser fields in three orthogonal directions forming a 3d optical lattice potential @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the wavelength of the laser light yielding a lattice period @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the height of the potential @xmath7 is proportional to the intensity of the @xmath8-th pair of laser beams , and is conveniently expressed in terms of the recoil energy @xmath9 for atoms of mass @xmath10 ( taking @xmath11 throughout ) .",
    "effective 1d systems are then formed by making laser intensities in two of the directions @xmath12 and @xmath13 very large ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the confinement is then sufficiently strong to inhibit any tunnelling or excitations in those directions on the energy scales we are concerned with .",
    "the result is an array of many isolated effective 1d systems in the @xmath15 direction  @xcite . for the remaining lattice intensity @xmath16",
    "we consider much shallower depths , but always remain deep enough ( @xmath17 ) to ensure that there is an appreciable band - gap between the lowest and first excited bloch band , given in the harmonic approximation by @xmath18 .",
    "combined with the ultra - low temperatures of the atoms this is sufficient to ensure that the dynamics can be described by the lowest bloch band of the lattice , and that the tight - binding approximation is applicable @xcite .    with the centre of lattice site @xmath19 in one such 1d system given by @xmath20 we can construct a complete and orthonormal set of localized mode functions @xmath21 factorized as the product of wannier functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the lowest bloch band for the shallow and deeply confined directions respectively .",
    "after expanding the bosonic field operator @xmath24 into these modes and restricting our consideration to one 1d system , the resulting hamiltonian @xmath25 reduces to the 1d bhm @xcite composed of @xmath26 sites @xmath27 where the operators @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are bosonic destruction ( creation ) operators for an atom in site @xmath19 .",
    "the parameters of the bhm are functions of the lattice depth @xmath30 with the matrix elements for hopping between adjacent sites @xmath19 and @xmath31 and on - site interaction strength given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34-wave scattering length , and a gaussian ansatz has been used for the tightly confined wannier states @xmath23 .",
    "the trapping offset is well approximated as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 describes an additional slowly varying trapping potential which could be due to magnetic trapping . in the case of @xcite the axial potential of the 1d system was dominated by the gaussian beam envelopes ( with @xmath37 waists @xmath38 ) of the lasers for the strongly confined directions characterized by the trapping frequency @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the physics of the bhm is governed by the ratio @xmath40 .",
    "competition between these two terms results in a transition at temperature @xmath41 for a critical ratio @xmath1 from the sf to the mi regime @xcite .",
    "mean - field theory for an infinite unit commensurately filled 1d system predicts that @xmath42 .",
    "however , if the strong quantum fluctuations present in 1d are taken into account , the appearance of the sf regime is not predicted to occur until the critical ratio drops to @xmath43 @xcite",
    ". the presence of trapping and the finite size of a system modifies the nature of the transition , prohibiting it from being sharp and so in line with the experiment @xcite we expect the transition to occur gradually somewhere in between these limits @xcite .      in the experiment @xcite the 1d system",
    "was initially prepared in the groundstate for some depth @xmath30 , ranging from the sf to mi regime . the axial lattice depth",
    "was then subjected to a modulation of the form @xmath44\\sin^2(q_bx ) , \\label{modulate}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the modulation amplitude as a fraction of the initial lattice depth , and @xmath0 is the modulation frequency  @xcite . the modulation was applied for a fixed time @xmath46  ms after which the energy deposited into the system was measured by time - of - flight imaging of central momentum width averaged over the many 1d systems realized .",
    "the applied modulation frequency was taken to a maximum of @xmath47  khz which defines the relevant energy scale for the system and was well below the band - gap .    to compare with the experiment we take the wavelength of the light used to form the optical lattice as @xmath48  nm , and the atomic species trapped as @xmath49rb , where @xmath50  nm , in all numerical values quoted . for our calculations we initially computed the groundstate of the system over depths @xmath51 for the large systems and slightly shallower depths @xmath52 for the small system @xcite , all with fixed particle number @xmath53 .",
    "we study a small and large system with box boundaries which are commensurately filled as @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "we also consider a harmonically trapped system where @xmath56 for a slightly smaller system with @xmath57 using @xmath58 hz and @xmath59 , as well as @xmath60 hz and @xmath61 .",
    "these trapping frequencies are close to that in the experiment @xcite where @xmath62 hz , and where sufficient to eliminate any occupation at the box boundaries of the system .",
    "the modulation given in equation  ( [ modulate ] ) was then applied to the system by computing time - dependent bhm parameters via equation  ( [ ujparams ] ) .",
    "this includes an implicit assumption that the wannier states describing atoms in the lattice adiabatically follow the variations in the lattice potential induced by the modulation .",
    "given that the timescale of atomic motion in a lattice site is @xmath63 and that this is typically an order of magnitude greater than the modulation frequencies applied , the adiabatic assumption is reasonable .",
    "the response of the system was then measured via the total energy @xmath64 , with respects to the unperturbed bhm , for different @xmath0 . to demonstrate the evolution of the spectra at different depths we use the same fixed range for @xmath65 at all depths .",
    "this range is identical to the experiment and is likewise quoted in khz while the energy absorbed is expressed in units of @xmath66 .",
    "we consider a straightforward linear response treatment of this excitation scheme which follows under the same assumption used for the numerical calculation that the system is described by the bhm with time - varying parameters @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 $ ] . for perturbative calculations we make an additional assumption that the modulations are weak and approximate the variation of these functions about the initial depth @xmath30 linearly resulting in a harmonic perturbation @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "the perturbation is split into a part that is proportional to the unperturbed bhm hamiltonian @xmath75 and a part proportional to the hopping operator @xmath76 under the proviso that @xmath77 .",
    "the first part can not induce excitations and instead gives a small time - dependent shift to the unperturbed energies which can be ignored . as a result",
    "the excitation operator of this perturbation is just the hopping operator @xcite with coupling @xmath78 . by acting over the whole system",
    "uniformly it creates excitations with zero quasimomentum as expected .",
    "let us label the eigenstates of the unperturbed bhm @xmath75 as @xmath79 with energy @xmath80 .",
    "the principle quantities of interest are the excitation probabilities @xmath81 for the transitions to the excited states @xmath79 from the groundstate @xmath82 due to this perturbation being applied for a time @xmath83 with a frequency @xmath0 . in first - order time - dependent perturbation theory",
    "these are given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this result reduces under the rotating wave approximation and the limit @xmath87 to the familiar golden rule result .",
    "we also make use of the second - order result @xmath88 where @xmath89 . the total energy absorbed by the system , relative to @xmath75 , is then @xmath90 .",
    "for the large systems investigated later in sections [ large ] and [ trapped ] exact integration of the many - body schrdinger equation is not feasible . to compute these results we employed the tebd algorithm @xcite which is a quasi - exact numerical method that allows the dynamical evolution of 1d quantum lattice systems with nearest - neighbor interactions to be computed efficiently and accurately .",
    "the algorithm has been successfully applied to numerous physical systems including the bhm @xcite .",
    "not long after being proposed by vidal it was recognized @xcite that tebd shares some conceptual and formal similarities with the well established density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite method enabling the development of a new adaptive time - dependent - dmrg algorithm which incorporates optimizations from both .",
    "a detailed analysis of the accuracy and error propagation of this method was given by gobert _",
    "et al _ @xcite and applies quite generally to tebd also .",
    "we do not describe the tebd algorithm here , except to mention some specific issues , and instead refer the reader to the relevant articles above for more details .",
    "the objective of the simulations in this paper were to map out the response of the system with the modulation frequency @xmath0 and depths @xmath40 which cross the sf - mi transition .",
    "for sufficient sampling this required in excess of 1000 simulations for both the box and harmonically trapped systems presented here .",
    "consequently we were limited for practical reasons to using a truncation parameter @xmath91 ( see @xcite for an explanation of @xmath92 ) for all simulations which was lower than that strictly necessary in order to achieve full convergence .",
    "thus we can not claim that our calculations are quasi - exact and would not expect the many - body state given by the simulation at the end to have a high fidelity with the true state of the system .",
    "instead we treat our calculation as an approximation in the same spirit as the gutzwiller ansatz @xcite ( where @xmath93 ) , but with the important difference that since @xmath94 we are permitting a non - negligible amount of quantum correlations . given that we are only interested in the total energy , which is an observable composed of one- and two - particle correlations",
    ", we expect that this approximation should yield quantitative agreement for the system sizes and regimes considered here .",
    "indeed , we have carried out more accurate calculations at specific points which reveal that the total energy is a robust observable with respects to truncation @xcite .",
    "consequently , the features of the energy spectrum do emerge , even with this relatively low @xmath92 , and the approximations made do not invalidate the results presented here . for simulations of the lattice modulation problem at some specific lattice depths with larger @xmath92 see the recent work by kollath _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "we begin by studying the exact dynamical evolution of the bhm under the lattice modulation for a small system composed of @xmath95 sites and @xmath96 atoms with box boundary conditions .",
    "this system is large enough to produce many of the essential physical features while still permitting the exact eigenstates to be computed  @xcite .",
    "in fact we find that much of what is learnt from the small system can be directly applied to the larger systems .",
    "we make use of this by computing the energy spectrum @xmath80 and perturbation matrix elements @xmath97 for two lattice depths with @xmath98 and @xmath99 representing the sf and mi regimes respectively . in figure",
    "[ exactspec](a ) the mi spectrum is shown with its characteristic gapped structure composed of hubbard bands located around multiplies of the dominant interaction energy @xmath100 and spread by finite hopping @xmath101 .",
    "in addition to the spectrum , the perturbation matrix elements @xmath97 which are of order @xmath102 or above are shown as the vertical lines . for the mi the most numerous ( and strongest ) contributions are to the @xmath100-hubbard band which is described by 1-particle - hole ( 1-ph ) excitations like those depicted in figure  [ exactspec](c)(i ) . the matrix elements to the @xmath103-hubbard band , which is composed of two 1-ph excitations shown in figure  [ exactspec](c)(ii ) ,",
    "cancel to first order explaining the absence of lines for this manifold . however , there are a small number of matrix elements to first order connecting the groundstate to the @xmath104-hubbard band via two 1-ph excitations with both particles on the same site as in figure  [ exactspec](c)(iii ) , but not to three 1-ph excitations as in figure  [ exactspec](c)(iv ) . in figure",
    "[ exactspec](b ) the ` gapless ' sf spectrum is shown . here in contrast to the mi",
    "there are significant contributions to @xmath97 stretching from below an energy of @xmath100 to below @xmath104 . separated from this",
    "there are contributions tightly distributed around @xmath105 .",
    "given the comparatively equal strengths of the hopping and interaction terms for the sf regime at @xmath98 there is no simple picture of either the groundstate or the excitations related to these contributions as there was for the mi regime . despite this the exact eigenstates for",
    "this small system do reveal two important details : firstly two 1-ph configurations like those in figure  [ exactspec](c)(iii ) have an average energy relative to the @xmath98 groundstate which exceeds @xmath105 ; and secondly these types of configurations are the dominant contributions in the relevant eigenstates around @xmath105 .",
    "this overlap in the nature of the excitations points to the possibility , which we shall shortly confirm , that a resonance to @xmath104 excitations in the mi regime will evolve into a @xmath105 resonance as the sf regime is entered .     for ( a ) @xmath99 mi regime , and ( b ) @xmath98 sf regime . in both cases",

    "the total energy of the system @xmath108 is shown after the modulation as a function of @xmath0 for the mi regime with @xmath99 . as expected from the matrix elements @xmath97 in figure  [ exactspec](a )",
    "there is strong response centred around @xmath100 spread by the width of the @xmath100-hubbard band which is approximately @xmath109  [ khz ] , and a smaller ( barely visible ) response at @xmath104 .",
    "the linear response predictions based on equation  ( [ first ] ) are shown also and agree well .",
    "for the largest peak the growth of energy over the modulation time is shown in figure  [ linearresp](b ) and the slight overestimation of the energy by linear - response is evident at later times . the same calculation for the sf regime with @xmath98",
    "is shown in figure  [ linearresp](b ) .",
    "again the results of linear - response agree well and the structure follows that of perturbation matrix elements with a broader response between @xmath100 and @xmath104 and an equivalent strength resonance at @xmath105 .     absorbed in the mi regime with @xmath99 as a function of @xmath0 , ( b ) @xmath108 over time for the largest mi peak at @xmath110  [ khz ] for the exact ( e ) and linear - response ( l ) calculations , and ( c ) @xmath108 against @xmath0 for the sf regime with @xmath98 . in ( a ) and ( c )",
    "the markers ( o ) and ( * ) denote the exact and linear response results respectively , while the lines are drawn to guide the eye.,width=529 ]    in line with the experiment  @xcite from this point on we consider much stronger modulations with @xmath111 .",
    "the result of these for the mi and sf regimes is given in figure  [ smallspec ] .",
    "for the mi in figure  [ smallspec](a ) we see that the discrete resonances around @xmath100 have now filled out into a single peak centred on @xmath100 that is about 25% wider than the @xmath100-hubbard band at @xmath112 [ khz ] , and that the stronger modulation has now increased height of the @xmath104 peak relative to the @xmath100 peak . in figure  [ smallspec](a )",
    "we have also included both first- and second - order perturbation theory results .",
    "for such strong modulations the applicability of perturbation theory is highly questionable , especially for the long times considered here .",
    "this is exemplified by the gross overestimation of the central peak at @xmath100 by both linear- and quadratic - response . in figure",
    "[ smallspec](b ) curve ( i ) shows the saturation of energy absorption for the central peak at @xmath100 and departure from linear response after a short time .",
    "in contrast for the peak at @xmath104 figure  [ smallspec](b ) curve ( ii ) shows that linear - response underestimates the energy absorbed due to its neglect of the role these eigenstates play in the indirect processes to higher energies .",
    "however , the use of quadratic - response given by equation  ( [ second ] ) provides some useful insight into the additional structure seen for the strong modulation which do not appear for weak modulations and is not predicted by linear - response .",
    "specifically , the small satellite peaks either side of the dominant peak at @xmath100 , which are located at @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively , only appear at second and higher order leading to their natural identification as the absorption of two quanta of energy @xmath0 from the perturbation to reach to @xmath100- and @xmath104-hubbard bands .",

    "firstly , as with the weak modulations , the mi peak at @xmath100 is seen to broaden and shift upwards in energy into the sf response , and this change is most prominent after the depth is lower than @xmath116 .",
    "secondly , it is now clear that the resonance at @xmath104 for deep in the mi regime reduces only slightly in energy and ends up as the @xmath105 resonance in the sf regime .",
    "additionally , in line with weaker modulations in figure  [ linearresp ] , the @xmath105 peak is stronger than the @xmath104 peak it evolves from , and signatures of this change are already visible in figure  [ smallfull ]  ( a ) .",
    "finally , by progressing to slightly shallower depths ( @xmath117 ) in figure  [ smallfull ] we see the broadening of the sf spectrum over the entire frequency range considered caused by the eventual merging of the @xmath100 to @xmath104 response with the @xmath105 peak .     absorbed by a small box system over a sequence of depths , ranging from the mi to sf regimes , as a function of @xmath0 for strong modulations .",

    "as might be expected the increase in the size of the system reduces finite size effects resulting in much smoother excitation profiles .",
    "however , the essential features of these plots still follow directly from our analysis of a small system in terms of both the position and width of the resonances . specifically , the width of the @xmath100 peak in figure  [ boxspec](c ) is again slightly larger than the width of the @xmath100-hubbard band for this system given approximately by first order perturbation theory as @xmath123 [ khz ] .",
    "the effects of saturation also appear to follow similarly with the maximum energy absorbed per particle being nearly identical for the two system sizes .     of the groundstate for ( a )",

    "the increased size of the system permits us to investigate more conclusively some of the observations made earlier regarding the evolution of the absorption spectra with decreasing depth .",

    "the plot shows that the strength of this peak displays a distinct alteration in its behavior close to @xmath125 where it jumps from an increasing to a decreasing curve .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with what was seen earlier for the small system and can be attributed to the increasing sf character with a strong @xmath105 peak becoming dominant over the weaker @xmath104 mi peak .     absorbed by a large box system over a sequence of depths , ranging from the mi to sf regimes , as a function of @xmath0 for strong modulations .",

    "the centre @xmath127 and the full - width - half - maximum @xmath128 extracted from this fitting then characterizes quantitatively the behaviour which is evident in figure  [ boxfull ]  ( b ) .    in figure  [ boxanalysis ]  ( b )",
    "we see that the centre @xmath127 of the @xmath100 peak remains relatively stationary until @xmath131 where it then shifts more dramatically to higher energies .",
    "this is again a signature of increasing sf character consistent with the disappearance of the gap between the @xmath100- and @xmath103-hubbard bands and the shifting of the strongest contributions to @xmath97 to higher frequency seen for the small system .",
    "the width @xmath128 in figure  [ boxanalysis ]  ( c ) instead displays a gradual increase without any pronounced changes .",
    "it is clear from the structure of both the mi and sf spectra shown in figure  [ boxspec](c ) and ( d ) that the box system has some differences compared to the 1d spectra obtained in the experiment .",
    "these differences are not surprising given that the sf state of the box system at @xmath122 exhibits significant quantum depletion of @xmath132 , which is much larger than that in the experiment . also , at all depths considered here the groundstate of the box has a near homogeneous density of 1 atom per site , as can be seen in figure  [ boxspec](a ) and ( b ) , which is different from the harmonically trapped system in the experiment .      to approach a setup closer to that of the experiment",
    "we now consider a system with @xmath57 and @xmath59 superimposed with harmonic trapping using @xmath133 hz .",
    "a significant difference is that at @xmath122 the depletion of the sf state is reduced to @xmath134 in line with the experiment for this setup .",
    "the one - particle density matrices for the mi and sf groundstates in this case are shown in figure  [ harmonicspec](a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "we now see that the mi state is composed of a central core with unit filling along with small sf lobes at the edges .",
    "this change in structure compared to figure  [ boxspec](a ) introduces additional types of excitations such as those caused by particles hopping into the vacuum surrounding the mi core . for the sf state",
    "there are now significantly greater off - diagonal correlations in @xmath135 compared to the box system . despite these differences",
    ", however , the form of the spectrum shown in figure  [ harmonicspec](c ) and ( d ) remains very close to the box system displaying the same characteristic peaks as before .",
    "the effects of trapping manifest themselves in this case by flattening of the @xmath100 peak , along with the broadening and shifting of the @xmath105 peak . the maximum energy per particle",
    "again remains approximately equal to the previous cases considered , showing that the saturation effects are not significantly altered by the trapping .     of the groundstate for a trapped system with @xmath133 hz for ( a ) the mi regime with @xmath99 and ( b ) the sf regime with @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding excitation spectra of the total energy @xmath108 against the modulation frequency @xmath0 for these groundstate are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) respectively.,width=529 ]    in figure  [ harmonicfull ] we report the spectra for the system ranging over sf to mi regimes as before . again , the essential features of this plot follow from our earlier discussion . performing",
    "the same analysis on the evolution of the spectrum demonstrates that maximum strength of the @xmath124 peak has a maximum at @xmath136 as shown in figure  [ harmonicanalysis](a ) .",
    "the trapping is also seen to introduce peaks and troughs to this curve compared to the smooth behaviour of the box system .",
    "also , in contrast to the box both the centre @xmath127 and width @xmath128 of the @xmath100 resonance show a gradual change from the mi to sf character in figure  [ harmonicanalysis](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this reflects a difference in the evolution of @xmath100 resonance , which for the box develops a visible two - peaked structure in figure  [ boxfull](a ) , whereas in the harmonic trap this is washed out into a broader and flatter response in figure  [ harmonicfull](a ) .",
    "absorbed by a @xmath57 and @xmath59 harmonically trapped system over a sequence of depths , ranging from the mi to sf regimes , as a function of @xmath0 for strong modulations .",
    "( b ) a colour - map of plot ( a).,width=529 ]     absorbed for the @xmath126 peak with the lattice depth @xmath40 .",
    "( b ) the centre position @xmath127 , and ( c ) width @xmath128 of the @xmath100 resonance with the lattice depth @xmath40 .",
    "the dotted lines in all cases is drawn to guide the eye.,width=529 ]    we have seen that the introduction of harmonic trapping for the case considered above has not lead to any new features in the spectrum beyond a small amount of shifting and broadening .",
    "one such feature which might be expected is the emergence of a resonance at @xmath103 .",
    "however , it is known that the relevant excitation processes for a @xmath103 resonance require either excitations to already be present in the system due to finite temperature @xcite , or significant inhomogeneity in the density caused by a trap @xcite .",
    "since the system above is at @xmath41 and has virtually no incommensurability in the mi , beyond the small sf lobes at the edges , the lack of a @xmath103 resonance is consistent . in the experiment",
    "both finite - temperature and inhomogeneity are expected to make important contributions to the spectrum .",
    "presently there are still open questions as to which is the most dominant and what interplay there might be between these effects .",
    "future studies with the tebd algorithm , exploiting recent developments which permit the simulation of master equation evolution of 1d finite - temperature and dissipative systems @xcite , could allow both these effects to be treated on an equal footing .    to demonstrate the contribution of inhomogeneity we have performed additional calculations again using @xmath57 but with a larger occupancy of @xmath61 and larger trapping frequency @xmath137 hz . in figure  [ bigharmonicspec](a ) the one - particle density matrix of the mi groundstate at @xmath99 is shown and displays the coexistence of significant mi and sf regions characteristic of trapped systems . despite using a larger lattice site dimension @xmath138 for this setup we found that truncation in on - site occupancy limited the smallest @xmath40 from which we could reliably compute the spectrum to @xmath139 . the one - particle density matrix for the @xmath139 groundstate is shown in figure  [ bigharmonicspec](b ) and appears to be dominated by a central sf region .",
    "the excitation spectra for these two groundstates are shown in figure  [ bigharmonicspec](c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "for the mi in figure  [ bigharmonicspec](c ) a pronounced @xmath103 resonance is seen in addition to the peaks seen in previous mi spectra .",
    "the appearance of a @xmath103 peak in the @xmath41 case examined here arises predominantly from particles in the unit filled mi shell hopping into the doubly occupied region at the centre @xcite which is evident in the one - particle density matrix shown in figure  [ bigharmonicspec](a ) .",
    "for the shallower depth @xmath139 the spectrum in figure  [ bigharmonicspec](d ) exhibits the initial merging of the @xmath100 and @xmath105 peaks with this @xmath103 peak . in figure  [ bigharmonicfull ] the evolution of the spectrum between these limits",
    "the form of these spectra is very reminiscent of that shown in the experiment @xcite and it is likely that a more detailed analysis of this setup to shallower lattice depths would reveal the broad sf resonance seen experimentally .     of the groundstate for a trapped system with @xmath137 hz for ( a ) the mi regime with @xmath99 and ( b ) an intermediate regime with @xmath139 .",

    "we have examined in detail the dynamical response at @xmath41 of the ultracold atoms in an optical lattice subjected to lattice modulations .",
    "we have reported the evolution of the excitation spectrum with the lattice depth from the sf to mi regime for small and large box systems , and for large harmonically trapped systems . for the box system we identified two pronounced signatures of the transition from the mi to sf regime , specifically the strength of the @xmath124 peak and the centre of the @xmath100 resonance .",
    "the introduction of trapping for the case considered here , where the occupancy remains less than or equal to unity , does not significantly alter the evolution of the spectrum compared to a box system .",
    "while we find that it does wash out any pronounced changes in the structure of the @xmath100 resonance with depth , the strength of the @xmath124 peak still exhibits a signature of increasing sf character .",
    "we also presented calculations showing spectra progressing from the mi regime for a harmonically trapped system which has a central region with greater than unit filling .",
    "we found that this changes the structure of the spectrum by introducing a @xmath103 resonance and brings our results closer with the experiment .",
    "direct comparison to the experiment @xcite , however , is difficult due to the 3d rethermalization performed prior to measurement , which can not be simulated with tebd , and the fact that the measurement itself was an averaged result over many 1d systems in parallel with differing total particle number . despite this our results point to that fact that the bhm is sufficient to explain all the features discovered in the experiment and that the experiment was a clean realization of this model as expected .",
