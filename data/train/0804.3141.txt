    "the discovery of bright quasars at redshifts @xmath5 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) implies that bhs as massive as several @xmath10 were already assembled when the age of the universe was less than @xmath11 gyr ( see the recent review by fan 2006 ) .",
    "the bh masses are inferred from the quasars luminosities , assuming these sources shine near their eddington limit .",
    "strong gravitational lensing or beaming could , in principle , mean that the inferred bh masses are overestimated ; however , there is no obvious sign of either effect in the images and spectra of these quasars ( willott et al .",
    "2003 ; richards et al . 2004 ) .",
    "indeed , their relatively `` normal '' line  to  continuum ratio , consistent with those in lower  redshift quasars , makes it unlikely that the apparent flux of these sources was significantly boosted by beaming ( haiman & cen 2002 ) .",
    "likewise , the lack of a second detectable image on _ hubble space telescope _ images ( richards et al . 2004 ) essentially rules out the hypothesis that most of the sources experienced strong magnification by lensing ( comerford et al . 2002 ; keeton et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "relatively little time is available for the growth of several@xmath12 smbhs prior to @xmath13 , and their seed bhs must be present as early as @xmath14 ( e.g. haiman & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "as the smbhs grow from high  redshift seed bhs by accretion , they are expected to encounter frequent mergers . a coalescing bh binary experiences a strong recoil due to gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted during the final stages of their merger .",
    "the typical recoil speed is expected to be @xmath15 ( and may be as large as @xmath16 for special bh spin configurations ; see , e.g. campanelli et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) , significantly exceeding the escape velocity ( @xmath17 ) from typical dm halos that exist at @xmath14 . as a result",
    ", smbhs are often ejected from their host halos at high redshift .",
    "the repeated loss of the growing seeds makes it especially challenging to account for the several@xmath12 smbhs at @xmath5 without at least a brief phase of super  eddington accretion , or some equivalent `` head  start '' ( haiman 2004 ; yoo & miralda - escud 2005 ; shapiro 2005 ; volonteri & rees 2006 ) .",
    "there have been several recent proposals that such a `` head  start '' may occur in metal ",
    "free gas in high  redshift dm halos with virial temperatures exceeding @xmath0k , leading to the rapid formation of smbhs with a mass of @xmath3 . as",
    "primordial gas falls into these halos , it initially cools via the emission of hydrogen ly@xmath18 photons .",
    "provided the gas is free of @xmath1 molecules , its temperature will remain near @xmath19k .",
    "bromm & loeb ( 2003 , hereafter bl03 ) performed hydrodynamical simulations of a metal and @xmath1free halo , with a mass of @xmath20 collapsing at @xmath21 , corresponding to a 2@xmath22 gaussian overdensity and to @xmath23  k. under these conditions , which may apply to some dwarf galaxies collapsing close to the epoch of reionization , the primordial gas is marginally able to collapse and remains nearly isothermal .",
    "bl03 found that during the evolution , fragmentation of the gas cloud is very inefficient , leading at most to binary formation even with some degree of rotation .",
    "thus , a super  massive star is expected to form , and evolve into a smbh with a mass as high as @xmath3 .",
    "oh & haiman ( 2002 ) and lodato & natarajan ( 2006 ) have also showed that if h@xmath24 formation is inhibited , a primordial - gas disk is stable to fragmentation and a single massive object is formed in accordance with bl03 s conclusion .",
    "volonteri & rees ( 2005 ) arrived at similar conclusions , by considering bondi accretion onto a stellar seed bh , which can significantly exceed the eddington rate at the gas density and temperature in a similar halo .",
    "finally , begelman et al . ( 2006 ) and spaans & silk ( 2006 ) proposed different mechanisms to form similarly massive bhs by the direct collapse of primordial , atomic gas . for reference , we note that the total ( dm+gas ) mass of halos with @xmath25k at @xmath26 is @xmath27 , so that such smbhs would represent @xmath28 of the gas mass in these halos .",
    "we also note that in the wmap5 cosmology , the age of the universe at @xmath26 and @xmath29 is @xmath30gyr and @xmath31 gyr , respectively . at the e  folding time  scale of @xmath32 years ( assuming eddington accretion , and a radiative efficiency of 10% ; see , e.g. , haiman & loeb 2001 ) , a seed bh of @xmath33 at @xmath14 _ could _ easily grow to a super massive bh of @xmath34 at @xmath35 , if fed uninterruptedly .    _",
    "a crucial assumption in all of the above proposals is that @xmath36 molecules can not form as the gas cools and condenses in the dm halo_. this assumption can be justified in the presence of a sufficiently strong far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation , so that molecular hydrogen ( or the intermediary @xmath37 necessary to form @xmath1 ) is photodissociated .",
    "the relevant criterion is that the photodissociation timescale is shorter than the @xmath1formation timescale ; since generically , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the condition @xmath40 yields a critical flux @xmath41 . in dm halos with @xmath42k",
    ", whose gas can not cool in the absence of @xmath1 , the densities remain low and @xmath1 can be dissociated even when background flux is as low as @xmath43 ( e.g. haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ; mesinger et al .",
    "2006 ; here @xmath44 is the flux just below @xmath45ev , in the usual units of @xmath46 ) .",
    "however , if a gas cloud is massive enough and has a virial temperature higher than @xmath47  k , it is able to cool and start its collapse via atomic hydrogen ly-@xmath18 cooling .",
    "even if the fuv field is initially above the critical value , molecular hydrogen can form , and dominate the gas cooling at a later stage during the collapse ( oh & haiman 2002 ) ; the @xmath1formation rate is furthermore strongly boosted by the large out  of  equilibrium abundance of free electrons in the collisionally ionized gas in these halos ( shapiro & kang 1987 ; susa et al .",
    "1998 ; oh & haiman 2002 ) .",
    "the critical flux required to keep the gas @xmath1free as it collapses by several orders of magnitude therefore increases significantly ; for halos with @xmath2k the value has been found to be @xmath48 , depending on the assumed spectral shape ( omukai 2001 , hereafter o2001 ; bl03 ) . in halos exposed to such extremely intense uv fields ,",
    "the gas cloud is still able to collapse only via atomic hydrogen line cooling , namely ly @xmath18 and h@xmath49 free  bound ( f - b ) emission ( o2001 ) .",
    "one possible source of such an intense uv field is the intergalactic uv background just before the epoch of cosmic reionization ( bl03 ) .",
    "the ionizing photon flux @xmath50 can be evaluated from the number density of hydrogen atoms in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the average number of photons needed to ionize a hydrogen atom @xmath51 , which , in general , is @xmath52 , owing to recombinations in an inhomogeneous igm . using the escape fraction of ionizing radiation @xmath53 , the flux @xmath44 just below the lyman limit is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass fraction of hydrogen , @xmath56 is the proton mass , and @xmath57 is the baryon density ( assumed here to correspond to @xmath58 ; dunkley et al .",
    "equation  [ eq : jreion ] shows that @xmath44 can approach the critical value at @xmath59 , provided @xmath53 is small , and @xmath60 is large ; @xmath61 .",
    "although the value of @xmath53 is quite uncertain , in low ",
    "mass minihalos , the expectation is @xmath62 , as these halos are easily self  ionized , and most of their ionizing radiation escapes into the intergalactic medium ( kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ; whalen , abel & norman 2004 ) .",
    "observations of nearby star forming galaxies indicate lower values @xmath63 ( leitherer et al . 1995 , inoue et al . 2005 ) ; nevertheless , it appears unlikely that the mean cosmic background will reach the critical values .",
    "a few halos that have close and bright neighbors may still see a sufficiently increased flux ( dijkstra et al .",
    "alternatively , the critical value could be established by sources internal to the halo , e.g. by a vigorous phase of starburst ( omukai & yoshii 2003 ) or by the accreting seed bh itself ( volonteri & rees 2005 ) .",
    "so far , the process of supermassive star ( and smbh ) formation in dwarf galaxies in the presence of a strong uv background has been investigated only under the hypothesis that the gas is metal  free . however , the @xmath2k , @xmath64 halos forming close to the epoch of reionization are built from lower  mass progenitors that had collapsed earlier .",
    "many , and perhaps all of these halos should therefore be enriched with at least some trace amount of metals .",
    "furthermore , is it unlikely that the strong critical fuv flux could be generated and maintained without efficient star formation at higher redshifts ( if @xmath65 was produced by accreting bhs , this would significantly overpredict the present  day soft x  ray background ; dijkstra et al .",
    "it is well  known that adding metals and dust into a primordial gas , even at trace amounts as low as @xmath66 , can significantly affect its cooling properties ( schneider et al .",
    "2003 ; omukai et al . 2005",
    "; schneider et al .",
    "two independent hydrodynamic simulations ( tsuribe & omukai 2006 ; clark , glover , & klessen 2008 ) recently studied the fragmentation of metal  enriched collapsing protogalactic clouds , in the absence of an external fuv field , and found efficient fragmentation for @xmath67 .    in the present paper ,",
    "our goal is to answer the following question : _ can cooling and fragmentation be avoided in metal  enriched @xmath0k halos , irradiated by a strong fuv flux ? _",
    "if so , this would suggest that supermassive black holes may form , similar to the metal  free case , in the more likely case of metal  enriched high ",
    "redshift protogalaxies . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we here study the thermal and chemical evolution of low  metallicity gas , exposed to extremely strong uv radiation fields .",
    "we will evaluate the critical metallicity , above which fragmentation becomes unavoidable in the presence of a strong fuv flux .    in   [ sec : model ] , we describe our one  zone modeling procedure .",
    "our results are presented and discussed in   [ sec : results ] , first for the metal  free (   [ sec : metal - free ] ) , and then for the metal  enriched case (   [ sec : metal ] ) . the fragmentation and subsequent evolution of the metal ",
    "enriched clouds are then discussed in   [ sec : fragmentation ] and [ sec : corecollapse ] , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our results and offer our conclusions .",
    "we use the one  zone model described in omukai ( 2001 ) to follow the gravitational collapse of gas clouds .",
    "the model includes a detailed description of gas  phase chemistry and radiative processes , and the effect of dark matter on the dynamics in a simplified fashion .",
    "in addition , in the present version of the model we have implemented the contribution of metal lines and dust to gas cooling .    in",
    "what follows , all physical quantities are evaluated at the center of the cloud .",
    "the gas density increases as @xmath68 where the collapse timescale , @xmath69 , is taken to be equal to the free - fall time , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the sum of the gas and dark matter density .",
    "the dark matter density follows the evolution of a top  hat overdensity , @xmath72 with @xmath73 ( e.g. , chapter 8.2 of padmanabhan 1993 ) , where the turn - around and the virialization correspond to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "although , strictly speaking , this is correct only in the einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath76 ) , it does not cause a significant error in the high-@xmath77 universe ( @xmath78 ) we consider .",
    "the initial epoch of calculation is taken at the turn  around at redshift @xmath79 . from equation [ eq : zta ] ,",
    "the virialization and turn - around redshifts have the relation @xmath80 ; thus @xmath81 . in our calculation , the dark matter density is kept constant after reaching its virialization value @xmath82 .",
    "the initial values of the gas number density , temperature , ionization degree , and h@xmath24 fraction have been assumed to be @xmath83 , @xmath84  k , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , to reflect conditions at the turn  around at @xmath79 . some runs with initial temperature ten",
    "times higher ( 210k ) are also performed to confirm independence of our main results from the initial temperature .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89",
    ".    our calculation does not include the virialization shock .",
    "owing to fast cooling by ly@xmath18 emission , the central region whose evolution we intend to follow does not experience the virialization shock in the spherically symmetric case ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ) . in more realistic calculations , the outer regions can experience shocks and the temperature and electron fraction become higher than in our case .",
    "in addition , recent numerical calculations ( e.g. kere@xmath90 et al . 2005 ) show that low - mass galaxies , especially at high - redshifts , obtain their gas through accretion predominantly along the large - scale filaments .",
    "three - dimensional effects such as asymmetric accretion might affect the evolution at low densities .",
    "however , since we are considering halos with @xmath91k , which can marginally collapse by ly@xmath18 cooling , the shock is not strong : the temperature increase is modest and the electron fraction reaches at most @xmath92 ( see figures 5a and 5c in bl03 ) .",
    "this additional electrons alter the early evolution for the @xmath93 case . however , in the irradiated clouds , where h@xmath24 formation is suppressed , during the collapse by the ly@xmath18 cooling recombination proceeds until the free electron fraction reaches @xmath94 , the value set by the balance between the recombination and the collapse time @xmath95 at 8000k .",
    "thus , our results for molecule formation and cooling are hardly affected .",
    "we adopt @xmath96 as the collapse time scale just because it has been widely used in other studies ( e.g. , palla et al .",
    "note that the free  fall time ( [ eq : tff ] ) is the time for density of an initially static cloud to reach infinity , while the dynamical timescale @xmath97 in the free  fall collapse is @xmath98 in the limit where the density has become sufficiently larger than the initial value .",
    "thus the rate we adopted ( [ eq : tff ] ) is @xmath99 times slower collapse than the genuine free ",
    "in fact , pressure gradients oppose gravity and the collapse becomes slower than the free  fall one within a factor of a few ( e.g. , foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "adoption of @xmath96 as the e  folding time for density increase mimics the pressure effect .",
    "the assumption of nearly free - fall collapse is invalidated , and the collapse is slowed down , once the cloud becomes optically thick to continuum radiation . however , our result on the thermal evolution is not altered : with little radiative cooling , the temperature is now determined by the adiabatic compression and the chemical cooling by dissociation and ionization , both of which are independent of the collapse timescale .",
    "moreover , the evolution after the cloud becomes optically thick is not relevant to our argument on fragmentation , which occurs at much lower density , in the optically thin regime .",
    "the overall size of the collapsing gas cloud ( or of the roughly uniform density central region ) determines its optical depth , and is therefore important for its thermal evolution .",
    "here we assume the size equals the jeans length , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the gas temperature , @xmath102 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "similarly , its mass is given by the jeans mass @xmath103 specifically , we assume that the radius of the cloud is @xmath104 and the optical depth is @xmath105 in addition to dust absorption ( see   [ sec : dust ] ) , we include the following primordial - gas processes as sources of the opacity @xmath106 ( table 1 of o2001 ) : the bound - free absorption of h , he , h@xmath49 , h@xmath107 , free - free absorption of h@xmath49 , h , collision - induced absorption of h@xmath108-h@xmath108 and h@xmath108-he , rayleigh scattering of h , and thomson scattering of electrons .    the temperature evolution is followed by solving the energy equation : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the internal energy per unit mass @xmath111 @xmath112 is the pressure , @xmath113 is the adiabatic exponent , and @xmath114 is the net cooling rate per unit volume .",
    "in addition to cooling and heating processes for the primordial gas , which include continuum emission , as well as emission by h and h@xmath24 lines , and chemical heating / cooling , the net cooling rate includes emission by c and o fine  structure lines @xmath115 , by dust grains @xmath116 , and heating by photoelectric emission of dust grains @xmath117 .",
    "cooling by fine ",
    "structure lines of [ cii ] and [ oi ] is included as in omukai ( 2000 ) .",
    "dust processes are described below in   [ sec : dust ] .",
    "gas chemical reactions are solved for the nine species of h , h@xmath108 , @xmath110 , h@xmath118 , h@xmath107 , h@xmath49 , he , he@xmath118 , and he@xmath119 .",
    "we do not explicitly include the chemical reactions involving metals . instead , all the carbon and oxygen",
    "is assumed to be in the form of cii and oi , respectively . having a lower ionization energy ( 11.26  ev ) than hydrogen ,",
    "carbon remains in the form of cii in the atomic medium owing to photoionization by the background radiation .",
    "we maintained this assumption even in @xmath93 runs , although carbon is expected to recombine and become neutral in these cases .",
    "the cooling rates by cii and ci fine  structure lines are within a factor of @xmath120 difference for @xmath121k , and therefore this assumption does not significantly affect the results . on the other hand , the ionization potential of oxygen ( 13.61  ev ) is very similar to that of hydrogen ( 13.60  ev ) and the charge exchange reaction @xmath122 keeps its ionization degree equal to that of hydrogen . in fact , the coefficient of the rightward reaction being @xmath123 , these reactions reach equilibrium only in @xmath124yr .    in a cold ( @xmath125 a few 100k ) and dense ( @xmath126 ) environment ,",
    "molecular coolants such as co and h@xmath24o may become important ( omukai et al . 2005 ) .",
    "since we are interested here in metal effects on warm ( @xmath127 a few 1000k ) atomic clouds , we neglect the contribution to cooling of metals in molecules",
    ". this simplification does not affect the early evolution of gas clouds , when the effects of metals induce a deviation from the primordial evolutionary track at several 1000k .",
    "it is true that it may alter the predicted thermal behavior at later stages , when the gas has cooled significantly ( @xmath125 1000k ) .",
    "however , even in such cold environments , the error in the temperature caused by neglect of metal molecular coolants is very small ( see figure 10 of omukai et al . 2005 ) and the thermal evolution is well reproduced when only dust processes and fine  structure line cooling of c and o are considered .",
    "dust in the local interstellar medium ( ism ) originates mainly from the asymptotic giant ",
    "branch ( agb ) stars , whose age is @xmath127 1 gyr , longer than the hubble time at @xmath128 . at higher redshifts , supernovae ( sne )",
    "are considered to be the major dust factories .",
    "indeed , the observed extinction law of high@xmath77 quasars and gamma ",
    "ray bursts can be well reproduced by this scenario ( maiolino et al .",
    "2004 , stratta et al .",
    "dust grains produced in sn ejecta are more effective in cooling and h@xmath24 formation because of their smaller size and larger area per unit mass ( schneider et al .",
    "however , their composition and size distribution are still affected by many uncertainties , such as the degree of mixing in the ejecta and the efficiency of grain condensation and their destruction by the reverse shock ( nozawa et al .",
    "2007 , bianchi & schneider 2007 ) .    to be conservative , in this work the properties of dust , such as grain composition and size distribution , are assumed to be similar to those in the solar neighborhood and its amount is reduced in proportion to the assumed metallicity of the gas clouds .",
    "specifically , we adopt the dust opacity model developed by semenov et al .",
    "this model partly follows the scheme proposed by pollack et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which was used in omukai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , assuming the same dust composition , size distribution and evaporation temperatures , but uses a new set of dust optical constants .",

    "the thermal evolution of metal ",

    "the models with a radiation temperature of @xmath140  k ( @xmath141  k ) are shown in figure [ fig : nt.t14 ] ( [ fig : nt.t15 ] , respectively ) for different values of intensity @xmath136 .    initially , i.e. at low densities , the temperature increases adiabatically , because there is not enough h@xmath24 to activate cooling . in the no radiation case ,",
    "when the density is @xmath156 and the temperature is @xmath157  k , sufficient h@xmath24 is formed and , as a result , the temperature decreases .",
    "it is to be noted that the relatively low temperature where this condition is met does not contradict previous results ( bl03 ) .",
    "in fact , the predicted temperature of each fluid element in the simulation of bl03 shows a large scatter at low densities .",
    "this scatter reflects the radial temperature gradient , and the central value , which we calculate here , corresponds to the lower boundary of the scattered points and it is in agreement with our result .",
    "we expect that the central temperature of the gas cloud does not reach the virial temperature of the host dark matter halo since the innermost region starts to cool and collapse during the adiabatic compression and does not experience the virialization shock .",
    "as the external radiation intensity @xmath136 increases , the onset of h@xmath108 cooling is delayed because higher densities and temperatures are required for h@xmath24 formation to compensate for the photodissociation .",
    "if the uv intensity is below a threshold value , @xmath158 , which we find to be in the range @xmath159 for @xmath140  k and @xmath160 for @xmath161  k , there is always a density at which h@xmath24 cooling starts to become effective .",

    "[ fig : nt.t14 ] and [ fig : nt.t15 ] , we find that the threshold value , @xmath158 , is lower for a radiation temperature of @xmath140  k than for @xmath161  k. thus , for comparable radiation intensities , @xmath136 , the lower @xmath138 radiation has a stronger impact on the cloud evolution . to understand why this is the case , in figure [ fig : radparam ] we show the h@xmath24 and h@xmath49 photodissociation rates , for the same intensity @xmath164 .",
    "the dilution factor @xmath165 , defined by @xmath166 , which was used in omukai & yoshii ( 2003 ) , is also shown for reference .",
    "as the figure shows , the h@xmath49 photodissociation rate decreases steeply with @xmath138 , while the h@xmath24 photodissociation rate remains nearly constant .",

    "h@xmath24 formation proceeds via a two step process ( h@xmath49 channel ) , @xmath171 and @xmath172 if h@xmath49 is photodissociated , it can not activate the second step ( [ eq : reaction2 ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why a lower @xmath138 radiation field leads to a less efficient h@xmath24 formation rate and to a lower h@xmath24 fractional abundance than a higher @xmath138 radiation field .",
    "cooling via h@xmath49 f - b emission occurs through the radiative association reaction ( [ eq : reaction1 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , h@xmath49 is collisionally dissociated through the reaction @xmath173 and the whole process results in a net cooling by the emitted photon .",
    "thus , as long as the collisional dissociation rate exceeds the photodissociation rate , the h@xmath49 f - b emission is hardly quenched , even in the presence of a strong fuv radiation field .",
    "due to the small opacity , h@xmath49 f - b cooling becomes important only at high densities ( @xmath174 ) and temperatures ( @xmath175 several @xmath176  k ) , where the above condition is always satisfied .",
    "then , h@xmath49 f - b cooling is not affected by photodissociation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : cool.t14j13d00m00 ] , radiative cooling and compressional heating rates almost balances for a wide range of densities .",

    "thus , the temperature increases with density for @xmath184 .",
    "the existence of a threshold uv background and the discontinuity of thermal evolution at this value are due to the presence of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) to lte transition of h@xmath24 ro  vibrational level population at @xmath185 . when the gas density is higher than this value , the cooling rate saturates and more h@xmath24 is needed to compensate for compressional heating .",
    "in addition , after the lte is reached , collisional dissociation rate is enhanced owing to a large h@xmath24 level population in the excited levels . thus ,",
    "if a strong fuv radiation delays h@xmath24 formation and cooling until the critical density for lte is reached , a fraction of the remaining h@xmath24 is collisionally dissociated .",
    "thus the gas cloud is no longer able to cool by h@xmath24 even at a later phase of the evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the uv background is slightly smaller than the threshold , the cloud begins to cool by h@xmath24 and the temperature begins to fall before the collisional dissociation effect becomes significant ( see figure 5b in omukai 2001 for cooling rates by each process in such a case ) .",
    "the lower temperature allows further h@xmath24 formation and resultant cooling .",
    "the cooling proceeds in this accerelated fashion and the temperature eventually reaches the molecular cooling track .",
    "this is the origin of the dichotomy between the atomic and molecular cooling tracks . to summarize , the main effect of the fuv radiation is to photodissociate h@xmath24 directly and to decrease the h@xmath24 formation rate through photodissociating h@xmath49 .",
    "if these two processes inhibit h@xmath24 formation and cooling until the critical density for lte is reached , the gas remains warm ( @xmath127 several thousands k ) and h@xmath24 is collisionally dissociated at higher densities . thus the high density evolution is not affected by the presence of the fuv field and depends only on the temperature at the h@xmath24 critical density .      in this section ,",

    "it is important to stress that the presence of a temperature dip in the thermal evolution , and the softening of the equation of state @xmath232 , imply only the possibility of fragmentation .",

    "in contrast , the numerical simulations by bl03 show that down to the highest density reached by the simulations ( @xmath241 ) fragmentation is very inefficient . even with some degree of rotation , the cloud fragments at most into two pieces , resulting in a binary system .",

    "thus , the mass of the central object resulting from this process can be estimated as , @xmath308    as can be seen in figures [ fig : nt.jz ] and [ fig : gamma ] , dust  induced fragmentation in clouds with a metallicity @xmath187}\\la -4 $ ] , starts at @xmath309  k , @xmath310 and the corresponding proto ",
    "cluster mass is @xmath311 .",
    "that is , @xmath312 and the entire cluster satisfies the condition ( [ eq : mergcond ] ) . in this case , the mass of the central object is limited by the mass of the cluster rather than by @xmath313 and its final mass can be estimated as , @xmath314 . on the other hand ,",
    "dust  induced fragmentation of clouds with metallicity , @xmath315 } \\la -3 $ ] , leads to proto  stellar clusters with masses @xmath316 and the mass of the central object is given by equation ( [ eq : mcen ] ) .",
    "thus , in this case a very massive star can form with @xmath317 . in either case",
    ", we note that the metal ",
    "poor , massive star ultimately forming at the center of the halo is likely to leave behind a seed bh remnant  except in a narrow range of metallicity , where they produce a pair instability supernova  either by direct collapse or by fallback ( heger et al .",
    "2003 ) . for higher metallicity , there are two episodes of fragmentation ; a metal",
    " induced one at low  density and a dust  induced one at high  density . in this case , the mass scale of the star cluster is relatively low and a massive bh seed is not formed .    as pointed out above , the critical metallicity levels we find in the case of strong fuv irradiation , at which the cloud behavior is modified from the metal  free case , is very similar to the critical metallicity found in earlier work for @xmath93 .",
    "it is therefore important to ask whether the presence of the flux will , in fact , make any difference to the ultimate fate of the cloud . at metallicities above @xmath187}\\simeq -3 $ ] , the flux has essentially no impact on the evolutionary track of clouds at high densities .",
    "for example , comparing the thin and thick solid curves of figure [ fig : nt.jz ] ( a ) it is clear that when @xmath187}= -3 $ ] , the flux has no effect at @xmath318 . at lower densities",
    ", we expect that the first fragmentation phase will occur as the jeans mass drops from @xmath319 to @xmath320 at @xmath321 in the @xmath93 case , and to @xmath322 at @xmath219 in the strong uv background case .",
    "therefore , the size of the molecular clumps that form is larger in the @xmath93 case .",
    "however , the thermal evolution thereafter is the same : the molecular clumps will experience a second phase of fragmentation when the jeans mass falls further , from @xmath323 to @xmath324 .",
    "thus , for protostellar gas clouds with @xmath187 } \\simeq -3 $ ] , the presence of an external uv field determines only the amount of gas in the envelope in which the @xmath325 star cluster is embedded .",
    "in contrast , the presence of a fuv background significantly affects the evolution of protostellar clouds with lower values of metallicity , @xmath187 } < -3 $ ] . in these models , the atomic gas experiences only the second phase of fragmentation induced by dust cooling , and therefore more massive star clusters ( @xmath326 , increasing with metallicity ) are formed compared to those in the @xmath327 limit ( a few - @xmath328 , depending weakly on metallicity ) .",
    "in addition to the size of the star clusters , the mass and physical conditions of the corresponding envelopes are different : when @xmath327 , the star cluster is embedded in a molecular envelope of @xmath329 with temperature of a few 100  k , while , in the presence of an external uv field , the surrounding envelope is more massive ( @xmath330 ) and it is made by atomic gas at several 1000  k. as a consequence , the presence of a strong uv background case favors the formation of a more massive central star by stellar merger ( larger stellar cluster mass and higher @xmath303 in eq .",
    "[ eq : mcen ] ) .    finally , our results and the discussion above suggest that the direct formation of a supermassive star or smbh as massive as @xmath331 , as envisioned in the metal  free case , is not possible when the metallicity is above a critical value , and the gas fragments into smaller pieces",
    ". however , we note that if fragmentation of the inner regions of the collapsing protogalaxy is not fully efficient , and if radiative and mechanical feedback from the stars does not expel the leftover gas from the nucleus , then the star cluster at the center of the halo , and its coalesced massive remnant star , can be embedded within a thick residual gaseous envelope with temperature @xmath332 several thousand k. since this gas envelope is self  gravitating , with a temperature below the virial temperature , it can undergo dynamical collapse , and may still produce a smbh either directly or by accretion onto the central stellar  mass bh at the bondi rate ( see , e.g. begelman et al .",
    "2006 and discussion therein ) .",
    "in particular , in the uv irradiated case , the accretion rate onto the star cluster , and possibly to the central coalesced star , is high  this is because of the high temperature in the envelope , and since the accretion rate of the self  gravitating gas is given by ( shu 1977 ) : @xmath333 in conclusion , higher initial mass , higher accretion rate , and larger amount of reservoir gas are more favorable for bh growth in the strong uv case than the case without radiation .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the thermal evolution and fate of proto ",
    "stellar gas clouds in @xmath334  k halos irradiated by a strong fuv background . under these conditions , which may apply to some dwarf galaxies collapsing close to the epoch of reionization",
    ", we find that :    * the effect of an external uv background is to photodissociate h@xmath24 directly and to decrease the h@xmath24 formation rate through photodissociation of h@xmath49 .",
    "when the uv background reaches a critical threshold value , @xmath158 , these two processes inhibit h@xmath24 formation and cooling until the critical density for lte is reached .",
    "thereafter , the gas cloud can cool only via atomic hydrogen transitions . * for gas clouds of primordial composition , an external uv background with intensity @xmath335",
    "only delays the onset of h@xmath24 formation and h@xmath24 cooling becomes important at some ( higher ) density : fragmentation occurs at densities @xmath336 leading to average fragment masses in the range @xmath337 , similarly to the case with @xmath338 . * for @xmath210 ,",
    "not enough h@xmath24 is formed to activate cooling and the evolution of primordial clouds is controlled by atomic ( h and h@xmath49 ) cooling .",
    "the clouds collapse nearly isothermally with a temperature of several thousands k ( `` atomic track '' ) up to very high densities @xmath339 . according to previous numerical calculation by bl03",
    ", the clouds collapse directly into a single @xmath340 object , leading to super massive star and smbh formation . a core ",
    "envelope structure inevitably develops under these circumstances , and the star grows by accretion onto an initially small inner core . during the accretion phase , radiative and mechanical feedback effects might become important and eventually halt the accretion at some phase ( e.g. , omukai & palla 2003 ; mckee & tan 2007 ) .",
    "if so , the mass of the central object can remain far below @xmath341 .",
    "* independently of the values and properties of the external fuv field ( as long as it is @xmath342 ) , deviations from the metal",
    " free `` atomic track '' start to appear when the gas is enriched by even trace amounts of metals and dust .",
    "when @xmath343 , dust cooling induces fragmentation at @xmath344 and a proto  stellar cluster is expected to form with average proto  stellar ( fragment ) mass of @xmath345 .",
    "if only gas  phase metals are present , a two orders of magnitude larger value of metallicity is needed , @xmath346 , before cii and oi line  cooling induce a deviation from the  atomic track  , leading to fragmentation at @xmath347 and to proto ",
    "stellar clusters with average proto  stellar ( fragment ) mass of @xmath348 . *",
    "the physical processes responsible for the origin of a critical metallicity and of its numerical value are the same as those found in the absence of an external fuv field . however , due to the higher gas temperature , the final outcome of the proto ",
    "stellar cloud collapse can be significantly affected .",
    "namely , if we assume that the size of the proto  stellar cluster formed by dust  induced fragmentation is set by the jeans mass at the onset of the rapid temperature drop , it depends on the intensity of the fuv background field : when @xmath349 , relatively small clusters are formed ( a few - 10@xmath350 ) whereas when @xmath351 , very dense star clusters with masses @xmath352 are formed , at the center of which stellar coalescences are expected to occur .",
    "the central merger object might grow to a very massive star of a few 100 @xmath350 . * in addition , the presence of an external fuv background affects the physical conditions of the envelope surrounding the proto - stellar clusters : when @xmath335 the envelope is fully molecular , with a mass of @xmath353 and a temperature of a few @xmath354  k. conversely , when @xmath351 the envelope is made of atomic gas and reaches a mass of @xmath355 and temperature of several @xmath356  k. the higher temperature and larger gas reservoir favors bh growth by accretion , which can be as high as @xmath357 .",
    "according to the above , the conditions that would allow the formation of the direct formation of a smbh are ( i ) to be hosted within a @xmath358  k halo , which is ii ) irradiated by a strong uv field with @xmath359 , and ( iii ) still metal and dust free , with @xmath360 .",
    "the main new result of the present paper is that if the metalicity is too high , so that condition ( iii ) does not hold , then instead of a smbh , a dense cluster of low ",
    "mass star forms at the halo nucleus .",
    "the stars in such a cluster may still rapidly coalesce into a single massive star , which may produce an intermediate  mass bh remnant , but with a smaller mass of @xmath9 .    while the above conclusion that even trace amounts of dust enable cooling and fragmentation of the proto ",
    "stellar clouds appear to be robust , the exact value of the threshold metallicity is vulnerable to the uncertain nature of dust in early protogalaxies ( see also schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , it is interesting to note that when @xmath361 the characteristic fragment mass  which is related to the characteristic stellar mass  is highly insensitive to environmental conditions , such as the presence of an external fuv radiation field , as also recently discussed by elmegreen , klessen & wilson ( 2008 ) .",
    "we warn the reader that our discussion on the nature and evolution of the resulting proto ",
    "stellar cluster is still speculative as it is based on a few numerical experiments which apply to dense stellar systems in present  day star forming regions ( see the discussion and references in section [ sec : corecollapse ] ) .",
    "for example , we assume that the size of the cluster is set at the onset of the efficient cooling phase , which appears plausible but has not yet been confirmed .",
    "in particular , in models with @xmath342 and @xmath362 ( when both dust grains and gas - phase metals are present ) , the thermal evolution curves appear to have two separate temperature minima , which correspond to metal and dust induced cooling and fragmentation .",
    "the fate of these collapsing clouds is at present unknown , and dedicated numerical simulations would be highly desirable .",
    "if proto - stellar clusters are indeed formed under the conditions that we suggest , the formation and the nature of a central object by repeated collisions and accretion is highly uncertain .",
    "for example , the fraction of stars on the massive side of the spectrum which falls to the cluster center ( i.e. , @xmath363 in eq . [",
    "eq : mcen ] ) by dynamical friction is unknown and may vary significantly depending on the imf .    despite the above uncertainties , our results suggest that even trace amount of metals preclude the rapid formation of smbhs as massive as @xmath364 in protogalactic halos . while such promptly appearing smbhs would help solving the puzzle of the @xmath365 quasar black holes at @xmath5",
    ", our results suggest that the low ",
    "metallicity halos may instead produce dense stellar clusters  the cluster may coalesce to produce an imbh , but still with a much lower mass of @xmath366 .",
