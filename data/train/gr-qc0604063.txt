    "the situation in brans - dicke cosmology has also been investigated @xcite , as have the cases of two arbitrary interacting fluids @xcite and more than two interacting fluids @xcite . in some cases , as in the example of accreting and evaporating black holes",
    ", there will be a two - way transfer of energy occurring as , say , a spectrum of radiation inhomogeneities collapse under their self - gravity in the early universe to form a population of primordial black holes but the products of the hawking evaporation of the black holes adds to the cosmological population of interacting relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "the different studies of these particular situations have often identified the existence of special power - law scaling solutions . in this paper",
    "we consider a general problem of this sort , describe its general behaviour , relate it to the existence of special power - law solutions , and describe its general solution succinctly in terms of the parameters defining the energy exchanges .",
    "the examples in the literature can then be shown to be particular examples of these solutions and the conditions for their stability are made clear .",
    "we will consider the mutual exchange of energy between two fluids at rates that are proportional to a linear combination of their individual densities and the expansion rate of the universe . in the absence of any interaction the fluids reduce to two separate perfect fluids .",
    "consider a flat friedmann robertson walker ( frw ) universe with expansion scale factor @xmath0 containing two fluids with equations of state @xmath1where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants , and the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath4 is governed by the friedmann equation @xmath5where @xmath6 .",

    "generalisations of this simple cosmology to spatially curved or anisotropic universes can be made in an obvious way if required @xcite . in an expanding universe ( @xmath10 )",

    "we can see this by defining @xmath34so that @xmath31 iff @xmath35 .",
    "we see that the denominator in equation ( [ delta ] ) is always positive , so @xmath36 is always non - singular and positive for finite and semi - definite positive values of @xmath37 and @xmath3 .",
    "it can also be seen that @xmath38 as either @xmath8 or @xmath39 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath36 must therefore occur at finite values of @xmath40 and @xmath9 .",
    "if this maximum exists when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are both non - zero then there must exist a point at which @xmath41using ( [ delta ] ) we can see that this condition is never met , so the maximum value of @xmath36 must exist when @xmath42 , when @xmath43 or when @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath42 we will have a maximum at non - zero @xmath45 when @xmath46which occurs iff @xmath47 , for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "similarly , the maximum can occur at non - zero @xmath8 when @xmath51 iff @xmath52 .",

    "we can show explicitly the existence of the above power - law attractors , and the smooth evolution of @xmath64 between them .",
    "it is possible to integrate ( [ ha ] ) to get a solution in terms of @xmath65 and the hypergeometric function @xmath66 .",
    "an expression in terms of more transparent functions can be found by defining a new time coordinate @xmath67 and integrating in terms of @xmath68 .",
    "this gives the solution @xmath69 this is the same form for the evolution of @xmath64 that was found by chimento and lazkoz in their investigation of phantom fluids in k - essence @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from this expression that @xmath70 as @xmath71 when @xmath72 . in terms of the coordinate @xmath73 this corresponds to the solution @xmath74 above . as @xmath59",
    "the solution smoothly approaches @xmath75 as @xmath76 , which corresponds to the solution @xmath77 .",
    "we have now shown that the two power - law solutions ( [ power2 ] ) exist and for all @xmath78 and are the attractors of the smoothly evolving general solution at late and early times when @xmath79 .",
    "it remains to investigate the limiting case @xmath80 .",
    "the exact solution to equation ( [ h ] ) when @xmath80 is @xcite @xmath81where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants . for @xmath84",
    "this solution corresponds to power - law expansion described by the degenerate case where @xmath85 . for @xmath86",
    "this solution is more complicated and is bounded by @xmath87 whilst approaching @xmath88 as @xmath70 or @xmath89 , which does not describe a power - law behaviour .",
    "an illustrative special exact solution to equation ( [ h ] ) exists when @xmath90 , as was shown by chimento @xcite . in this case",
    "( [ h ] ) can be linearised to @xmath91 by the substitution @xmath92 . hence , for this special value of @xmath93 @xmath94where @xmath95 are constants of integration .",
    "this expression can be integrated to @xmath96where @xmath97 is a constant and the early and late time behaviour is clear and has the same form as the power - law solutions ( [ power ] ) when @xmath90 .",
    "the conservation equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) can be used to construct the second - order differential equation @xmath98where @xmath99 and @xmath93 are defined as before and primes denote differentiation with respect to the variable @xmath100 .",
    "this equation can be solved for @xmath101 and the corresponding solution for @xmath12 can then be found from ( [ 3 ] ) . substituting these solutions into the friedmann equation ( [ 1 ] )",
    "gives , for @xmath102 , the solution ( [ ha ] ) that was previously found by solving the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "the advantage of considering the evolution of @xmath11 directly is that a particularly interesting behaviour can be observed in the evolution of the ratio @xmath103 for the self - similar solutions ( [ h ] ) . to find this behaviour we first note that a solution to equation ( [ rho ] ) is given by @xmath104where @xmath105 is a constant and @xmath106 . substituting this into equation ( [ 3 ] ) gives the corresponding solution for @xmath12 @xmath107where @xmath108 is constant .",
    "these solutions for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , when substituted into the friedmann equation ( [ 1 ] ) , correspond to the self - similar solutions for @xmath109 given by ( [ h ] ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that @xmath11 and @xmath12 evolve at the same rate and so the ratio @xmath103 is a constant quantity @xmath110during a period described by the power - law evolution ( [ power2 ] ) .",
    "it is this constant ratio in the energy density of two fluids with different barotropic indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 that has been used by a number of authors in an attempt to alleviate the coincidence problem concerning the the present - day values of the vacuum and matter energy - densities scal , free .",
    "the exact solutions found in the last sections provide us with extensions of the analysis of several cosmological problems that have been studied in the past , which can be defined by particular choices of the two parameters @xmath99 and @xmath93 .",
    "as we have seen , the overall dynamical behaviour is determined by the behaviour of the combination @xmath111      consider the problem of the long - term evolution of a universe containing equal numbers of electron - positron pairs @xcite .",
    "if these particles are assumed to be the lightest massive charged leptons then they can not decay , and can only disappear by means of the mutual annihilations @xmath112 .",
    "page and mckee set up a model for the @xmath113 annihilation into radiation that corresponds to taking the special case @xmath114 in equations ( 2 ) and ( [ 3 ] ) and the definition of @xmath115by page and mckee is given in terms of our @xmath9 by @xmath116 they find the power - law solution with @xmath117 which reduces to the usual dust frw model when @xmath118 and there is no annihilation into radiation .",
    "the effect of the annihilations is to push the expansion away from the dust - dominated form with @xmath119 towards the radiation dominated evolution with @xmath120 .",
    "the other power - law solution corresponds to the pure radiation case with @xmath121 we can verify that this power - law solution is an attractor by evaluating @xmath36 , since for the @xmath122 annihilation @xmath123 so @xmath124      a more complicated energy exchange problem was formulated by barrow , copeland and liddle @xcite who consider the problem of a power - law mass spectrum of primordial black holes forming in the early universe and then evolving under the effects of hawking evaporation of the part of the mass spectrum with hawking lifetimes less than the expansion age .",
    "this has two effects .",
    "the radiation background is supplemented by input from the black - hole evaporation products and the fall in the total black - hole density goes faster than the adiabatic @xmath125 that occurs in the absence of decays because the black hole population is a pressureless gas to a very good approximation , since @xmath126 for masses less than the planck mass @xmath127 at times greater than the planck time @xmath128 .",
    "accretion of background radiation in the radiation era of the universe by the black holes could be included , but is negligible .",
    "this corresponds to our model in the special case @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131where the initial number density spectrum of black holes with masses between @xmath132 and @xmath133 at time @xmath65 is given by @xmath134 and @xmath135    a power - law solution was found in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath136 , so long as @xmath137 , and the black hole evaporations have a significant effect on the expansion rate of the universe during the radiation era .",
    "we have @xmath138and so @xmath139we see that the allowed range of @xmath140 @xmath141 corresponds to @xmath142 and the expansion scale factor evolves as @xmath143 the @xmath144 limit corresponds to a pure dust - dominated expansion , with @xmath145 , while the @xmath146 limit corresponds to a pure radiation - dominated evolution , with @xmath147 .",
    "again we see that the power - law solution is an attractor for the general solution with @xmath140 in this range .",
    "when the expansion of the universe becomes dominated by cold dark matter , with @xmath148 , a power - law scaling solution no longer exists because the radiation products from the black - hole evaporations now make a negligible contribution to the total density of the universe , which is dominated by @xmath149 , and @xmath145 becomes the attractor for the evolution of the expansion scale factor .",
    "the cosmological evolution created by the decay of a vacuum stress ( @xmath150 into equilibrium radiation was considered by freese et .",
    "al . and many other authors @xcite .",
    "it is described by a special case of our equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it represents the decay of a scalar field stress with @xmath153 into radiation . in this case",
    "we have    @xmath154    with @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "we see that the first of these corresponds to the degenerate situation with pure radiation .",
    "the second solution has @xmath157 and requires @xmath158 if the evolution of the universe is to have a matter - dominated era following a radiation era . as the value @xmath9 increases , the dominance of the vacuum contribution slows the expansion whereas in the limit @xmath159 the expansion rate increases without bound and the dynamics approach the usual vacuum - energy dominated de sitter expansion with @xmath160 again we see that this simple solution can be generalised by using the full analysis provided above .",
    "we see from ( [ v2 ] ) that we always have @xmath35 with the maximum of @xmath36 achieved when @xmath161 .",
    "the solution ( [ sol3 ] ) - ( [ sol4 ] ) arises for @xmath162 which occurs when @xmath163 or @xmath164",
    "it was shown in section [ decaysec ] that for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath165 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 the maximum value that @xmath166 can take is @xmath167 . if we relax these assumptions , then @xmath36 can take values greater than @xmath167 and the qualitative character of the solutions to ( [ h ] ) is significantly altered",
    ". we will begin by investigating the conditions required for @xmath168 .    in the previous section",
    "it was shown that for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath2 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 the only point at which @xmath169 is at @xmath170 and @xmath43 and at all other points in this parameter range we have @xmath171 .",
    "it can be seen from ( [ delta ] ) that @xmath172 when @xmath173and that the first derivatives of @xmath36 are non - zero at any point where this condition is satisfied .",
    "these values of @xmath8 therefore separate regions where @xmath171 from those where @xmath168 .",
    "it can also be seen that @xmath168 only if @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "these conditions correspond to the fluid @xmath11 decaying and the fluid @xmath12 anti - decaying .",
    "( by ` anti - decaying ' we mean gaining energy in proportion to its energy density , instead of losing it ) .",
    "an example of an anti - decaying fluid is a ghost field which radiates away energy ; here the energy density of the ghost is negative , so a negative value of @xmath176 is required for the radiation to carry away energy .",
    "for @xmath168 the exact solution to equation ( [ ha ] ) is @xmath177where integration constants have been rescaled into @xmath64 and @xmath109 .",
    "again , this equation is difficult to solve in term of the coordinate @xmath65 . by introducing the new coordinate @xmath178 we get @xmath179which can be integrated to obtain a closed form for the expansion scale factor : @xmath180where @xmath181 is constant and",
    "am@xmath182 is the jacobi amplitude , shown in figure [ jacobi ] .",
    "the form of @xmath183 in ( sol5 ) is an always - positive oscillatory function of the time @xmath68 , with constant amplitude .",
    "the corresponding solution in terms of the coordinate @xmath65 will therefore also be oscillatory with constant amplitude .    ]",
    "whilst in the previous section we found that , for @xmath184 the scale factor evolves as a smooth function with early and late - time power - law behaviour , we have found for @xmath168 a substantially different behaviour .",
    "the scale factor now oscillates in time and does not display the simple power - law behaviour found in the @xmath35 situations .",
    "we have so far only discussed the cases where @xmath2 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this assumption is useful as it means that @xmath166 is non - singular in the parameter range @xmath8 , @xmath185 , for which it was shown in section [ decaysec ] that the maximum value of @xmath36 is @xmath167 .",
    "this result was subsequently used in section antidecay to show that there exists a parameter range with @xmath174 and @xmath175 for which @xmath168 . in this section",
    "we will relax the positive semi - definite assumption on the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , extending the analysis we have so far performed to the case of so called ` phantom ' fluids .",
    "we begin by showing that in the parameter range @xmath8 , @xmath152 there exist no points at which @xmath186 . for this to occur we would require the simultaneous satisfaction of the conditions @xmath187using the second of these conditions , we can eliminate @xmath8 in the first to find @xmath188where we still assume @xmath189 , without loss of generality .",
    "similarly , we can obtain for @xmath8 the expression @xmath190these two inequalities show that @xmath186 can only occur in the parameter space @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , in the range @xmath8 , @xmath152 the only singularities in @xmath36 that can occur are those in which @xmath191 . in this case we can again show , using the arguments in section [ decaysec ] , that the maximum value of @xmath36 when @xmath8 , @xmath192 is @xmath167 .",
    "the argument showing the existence of a region where @xmath168 in the range @xmath193 and @xmath175 now follows in exactly the same way as for the @xmath48 , @xmath49 case , given in section [ antidecay ] .",
    "the form of the solutions in the regions where @xmath171 and @xmath194 are the same as in the non - phantom case , and are given by equations ( [ ha ] ) and ( [ ha2 ] ) .",
    "we have determined the general solution of a simple model with the exchange of energy between two fluids in an expanding friedmann universe of zero spatial curvature .",
    "the total energy of the exchange is conserved and the model allows energy inputs and outflows proportional to the densities of the two fluids .",
    "a number of simple examples of this sort already exist , such as particle decays or particle - antiparticle annihilations into radiation , particle production , the evaporation of a population of primordial black holes , the decay of a cosmological vacuum or cosmological ` constant ' , and energy exchanges between quintessence and ordinary matter or radiation .",
    "however , these examples are restricted to one - way energy exchange and do not prove that the scaling solutions that they employ are attractors for the general solution .",
    "we have established the existence and form of simple power - law solutions for the expansion scale factor in the case of two - way energy exchange between fluids and determined that they are attractors for the late - time evolution in situations that are usually regarded as generic .",
    "if we allow one fluid to be anti - decaying then we can move into a domain where these power - law solutions are no longer attractors .",
    "again , we find the general behaviour for these cosmologies .",
    "these solutions provide a simple model for the study of a wide range of energy exchange problems in cosmology and also reveal the conditions under which power - law solutions previously used to solve some of these problems are stable attractors .",
    "they provide a simple model for many future studies of a variety of interacting fluid cosmologies .",

    "<S> we provide a simple mathematical description of the exchange of energy between two fluids in an expanding friedmann universe with zero spatial curvature . the evolution can be reduced to a single non - linear differential equation which we solve in physically relevant cases and provide an analysis of all the possible evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> particular power - law solutions exist for the expansion scale factor and are attractors at late times under particular conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we show how a number of problems studied in the literature , such as cosmological vacuum energy decay , particle annihilation , and the evolution of a population of evaporating black holes , correspond to simple particular cases of our model . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> we can determine the effects of the energy transfer on the expansion scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the situation in the presence of ` anti - decaying ' fluids and so called ` phantom ' fluids which violate the dominant energy conditions . </S>"
