    ", we have established these singular limits with weak assumptions @xcite .",
    "a main new concept arises in this limit , the _ constrained hamilton - jacobi _ equation introduced in @xcite which occurs by some kind of real phase wkb ansatz ( as for fronts propagations in @xcite ) @xmath16 here we have in mind the simple example of dirac masses approximated by gaussians @xmath17 it is much easier to describe the limit of @xmath18 !",

    "it follows from regularity that we can establish a form of the so - called _ canonical equation _ in the language of adaptive dynamics @xcite .",

    "the canonical equation enforces constraints on the dynamics which give the explanation .",
    "+ @xmath24 what is the long time behaviour of the concentration points @xmath25 ?",
    "a simple route is that the canonical equation comes with the structure of a gradient flow .",

    "also , we give a formal analysis , that shows the main ideas and avoids writing a list of assumptions ; those of the section [ sec : gca ] and [ sec : localcompetition ] are enough for our purpose .    in both cases",
    "one can easily see the situation of interest for us .",
    "the models admit a continuous family of singular , dirac masses , steady states parametrized by @xmath31 and the question is to study their stability and , when unstable , how the dynamics can generate a moving dirac mass .",
    "the dirac steady states are given by @xmath32 the total population size @xmath33 is defined in both models by the constraint @xmath34 with respectively for and @xmath35 a monotonicity assumption in @xmath36 for model , namely @xmath37 shows uniqueness of @xmath38 for a given @xmath39 . in case of it",

    "+ apart from this stable one dimensional manifold , the dirac steady states are usually unstable by perturbation in the weak topology .",
    "a way to quantify this instability is to follow the lines of @xcite and consider at @xmath47 an exponentially concentrated initial data @xmath48 it is convenient to restrict our attention to @xmath49 uniformly concave , having in mind the gaussian case mentioned in the introduction .",
    "then , @xmath50 measures the deviation from the initial dirac state and to see motion it is necessary to consider long times as @xmath51 or , equivalently , rescale the equation as @xmath52 and our goal is to prove that @xmath53    also the deviation to a dirac state turns out to stay at the same size for all times and we can better analyze this phenomena using the wkb ansatz .",
    "indeed , @xmath54 satisfies the equation @xmath55 as used by @xcite , because @xmath56 is concave , assuming @xmath57 is also concave ( this only relies on assumptions on the data ) , we conclude that @xmath58 is also concave and thus has a _",
    "unique _ maximum point @xmath59 .",
    "the laplace formula shows that , with @xmath25 the strong limit of @xmath59 , @xmath60    with some functional analysis , we are able to pass to the strong limit in @xmath61 and @xmath54 . despite its nonlinearity , we find the same limiting equation , @xmath62 still following the idea introduced in @xcite , we may see @xmath63 or @xmath64 as a lagrange multiplier for the constraint @xmath65 which follows from the a priori bound @xmath66 .",
    "the mathematical justification of these developments is rather easy here . for model",

    "has to justify persistence ( that is @xmath68 stays uniformly positive ) and strong convergence of @xmath69 .",
    "all this work is detailed below with the additional laplace terms .",
    "the constraint allows us to recover the fast dynamics of @xmath70 and @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , combined with , it yields @xmath71 assuming regularity on the data , @xmath72 is three times differentiable and the constraint also gives @xmath73 differentiating in @xmath74 , we establish the analogue of the canonical equations in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath75 ( in the case of model , this means the derivative with respect to @xmath0 in both places ) .",
    "inverting @xmath36 from the identities gives an autonomous equation .",
    "+ this differential equation has the structure of a gradient flow and this makes easy to analyze its long time behaviour , that is equivalent to know what are the stable dirac states for the weak topology ; the so - called evolutionary attractor or convergence stable strategy in the language of adaptive dynamics @xcite .",
    "eventhough this is less visible , it also carries regularity on the lagrange multiplier @xmath64 which helps for the functional analytic work in the case with mutations .",
    "another use of is to explain why , generically , only one pointwise dirac mass can be sustained ; as we explained earlier , the equation on @xmath76 also gives the global unknown @xmath70 by coupling with and this constraint is very strong . see section [ sec : numerics ] for an example .",
    "+ to conclude this quick presentation , we notice that the time scale ( in @xmath50 here ) has to be precisely adapted to the specific initial state under consideration .",
    "the initial state itself also has to be exponentially concentrated along with our construction ; this is the only way to observe the regular motion of the dirac concentration point .",
    "this is certainly implicitly used in several works where such a behaviour is displayed , at least numerically .",
    "of course , there are many other ways to concentrate the initial state with a tail covering the full space so as to allow that any trait @xmath0 can emerge ; these are not covered by the present analysis .",
