    "this spectroscopic region contains strong absorption features due to water , and weaker features due to methane , carbon - monoxide , and carbon dioxide .",
    "furthermore , swain et al . (",
    "2013 ) suggest the possibility of absorption due to metal oxides at shorter wavelengths",
    ". determining the relative amplitudes of absorption features in this window can constrain the atmospheric mean molecular weight , allowing us to infer the atmospheric metallicity and the dominant atmospheric constituents .",
    "additionally , observations indicating a lack of absorption features over this spectral region may suggest the presence of high altitude clouds or hazes .",
    "hazes and clouds can be due to either equilibrium condensates or photochemically produced titan - like hazes .    to date , wfc3 transmission observations have been reported for several planets including wasp 12b , gj 1214b , hd 209458b , wasp-19 and xo-1b . in this investigation",
    "we examine the wfc3 transmission spectrum of the warm saturn hat-12b .",
    "hat - p-12b was discovered with the hatnet ( bakos et al .",
    "2006 ) survey and found to be a low density ( 0.295 g @xmath1 ) sub - saturn mass planet orbiting a metal poor , 4650 k , 0.701@xmath2 star ( hartman et al .",
    "the planet is in a 3.2 day ( 0.084 au ) orbit and has a radius of 0.96@xmath3 and mass of 0.21@xmath4 .",
    "the equilibrium temperature is 965 k assuming full redistribution and zero albedo .",
    "miller & fortney et al . (",
    "2011 ) demonstrated that the mass and radius of this planet are consistent with an h / he ( 76% by mass ) planet with a core mass of 17 m@xmath5 .",
    "hat - p-12b s low density and relatively bright primary make it a favorable target for transmission spectroscopy , allowing us to explore the properties of exoplanetary atmospheres in this low - temperature regime . in this paper",
    "we present the first measurements of this planet s transmission spectrum .",
    "we first describe the observations followed by a discussion of the data reduction approach and a simple modeling analysis of plausible scenarios for the planet s atmospheric composition .",
    "hat - p-12b was observed on may 29th 2011 4:08:48 - 9:42:56 ut using the g141 grism of wfc3 in one visit as part as hst program 12181 ( pi d. deming ) .",
    "we obtained 111 images over the course of 4 orbits .",
    "each exposure spans 12.79 seconds .",
    "these observations were made before the implementation of the spatial scan mode ( deming et al .",
    "2013 ) , and therefore use a fixed pointing on the array .",
    "our data reduction approach is similar to that of berta et al .",
    "2012 , deming et al .",
    "2013 , and wilkins et al . 2013 .",
    "we first use the direct image of the star to set the reference point on the image by fitting the point spread function with a 2-d gaussian .",
    "the x - position is needed for the wavelength calibration and the y - position sets the center of the point spread function ( psf ) for the extraction box .",
    "the extraction box is fixed in the y - direction for the remaining images . for each image",
    "we use an extraction box size of 25 pixels ( roughly 7 spatial full - widths at half max of the psf ) in the spatial direction and 150 pixels in the wavelength direction centered about the 1st order spectrum .",
    "the images are subject to standard processing techniques .",
    "we use a 5@xmath0 median filter in time to remove cosmic rays in each pixel ( 0.007@xmath6 of all pixels ) . the pixels affected by cosmic rays",
    "are replaced with the median value from all other images in the time series .",
    "we also flat field and subtract the wavelength dependent sky background .",
    "the sky background is estimated using a box that is the same size as the first order spectral extraction box but offset by 100 pixels in the y ( cross - disperse ) direction .",
    "the sky image is also flat fielded before extracting the sky background .    in order to construct the white light transit curve we sum all the pixel values in electrons within each of the extracted images . upon computing the number of counts for each image",
    "we can construct the raw light curve ( figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) . the julian date ( jd ) given in the header",
    "is converted to barycentric julian date ( bjd ) using the idl routines of eastman , siverd & gaudi ( 2010 ) .",
    "we do not include the first orbit in our analysis because of unrepeatable systematics due to the thermal variations in the telescope that occur after a new target acquisition . some basic features to notice in figure [ fig : figure1 ] are , first , the 4 separate orbits and second , within each orbit there are 5 batches due to the buffer dump , each of which contain either 5 or 6 individual exposures . in each batch",

    "buffer dump the residual charge is automatically reset .",
    "we also find an outlier in our white - light curve near the center of the transit .",
    "this outlier also has a consistently low value in the light curves for our individual bands .",
    "we exclude this point from our subsequent analysis . neglecting this outlier",
    "does not affect the shape of the transmission spectrum .",

    "the total flux for each image is given in electrons .",
    "there are 4 orbits each of which contain 5 buffer dumps .",
    "after each buffer dump there is a residual charge build up that produces hook - like features .",
    "these features are reset after each buffer dump , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      we estimate the wavelength - dependent transit depth by subdividing the first order spectrum image into wavelength bins .",
    "the pixel values within each bin are summed to obtain the total number of counts within that bin .",
    "we choose a bin size of 5 pixels corresponding to a spectral resolution of 23 nm ( berta et al .",
    "this produces 30 spectral channels across the first order spectrum .",
    "the slope of the first order spectrum on the ccd does not change by more than one pixel across all 150 pixels , hence we can sum the pixels column - by - column . from tracking stellar features from image to image",
    "we find that horizontal jitter in the first order spectrum is virtually non existent .",
    "a wavelength calibration , or a mapping of the horizontal pixel number onto wavelength is preformed using the wavelength calibration function from the stsci pipeline ( kuntschner et al .",
    "2009 ) with updated calibration coefficients from wilkins et al . 2013 .",
    "the resulting spectrum spans from 1.037 @xmath7 m to 1.721 @xmath7 m .",
    "we model the eclipse with the mandel & agol ( 2002 ) idl routines .",
    "this parameterization is governed by four free parameters : the ratio of the semi - major axis to the stellar radius ( @xmath8 ) , the inclination ( @xmath9 ) , the center - of - transit time ( @xmath10 ) , and the planet radius to stellar radius ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we also include non - linear limb darkening parametrized with four coefficients . the limb darkening coefficients are determined by fitting a non - linear limb darkening parameterization ( equation 6 in claret 2000 ) to an intensity weighted atlas stellar spectrum ( t@xmath12=4650 k , log@xmath13=4.6 , [ m / h]=-0.3 ) over the appropriate wavelength range .",
    "we derive both the white - light limb darkening coefficients and the coefficients for each separate wavelength bin .",
    "in addition to modeling the eclipse depth , we also model the detector systematics .",
    "we use the  model - ramp \" parameterization described in berta et al .",
    "2012 given by @xmath14    this model adds an additional 5 free parameters ( @xmath15 ) to our total set of parameters .",
    "this  model - ramp \" parameterization accounts for a visit long slope ( @xmath16 ) , slope with - in each orbit ( @xmath17 ) , vertical offset ( @xmath18 ) , and an exponential model for hook ( @xmath19 ) . the resulting array from this equation is multiplied by the model light curve from the mandel & agol 2002 routine .",
    "we have chosen the  model - ramp \" approach rather than the divide - out - of - transit approach ( berta et al . 2012 ) to account for systematics that are not consistent from orbit to orbit ( wilkins et al .",
    "additionally , the  model - ramp \" procedure allows us to include one orbit of out - of - transit data ( the second orbit in figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) , whereas the divide - out - of - transit approach utilizes this orbit to correct the in - transit orbits . including this out - of - transit orbit provides a better constrained base - line for the light curve model .",
    "we use the idl mpfit ( markwardt 2009 ) levenbergh - markquardt curve fitting routine to find the optimal set of parameter values for the white light curve and each wavelength bin .",
    "the wavelength independent parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) are determined from the best - fit white - light curve ( table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "they are fixed at the best - fit values when fitting the light curves for each wavelength bin .",
    "we first fit the light curves without error bars .",
    "we then compute the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the residuals between the data and the best fit determined by mpfit .",
    "this rms value is then used as the actual uncertainty on each point .",
    "this is done for both the white - light eclipse and the eclipses in each spectral channel . upon deriving these rms error bars ,",
    "the fit is performed again to obtain the nominal set of model parameters and uncertainties .",
    "the final uncertainties on all parameters are the gaussian uncertainties derived from the mpfit covariance matrix .",
    "it has been shown in berta et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that the mpfit covariance derived parameter uncertainties are in good agreement with those derived from markov - chain monte carlo approaches for this type of data .",
    "we also performed a prayer - bead ( gillon 2009 ; carter et al .",
    "2009 ) analysis to explore the effects of time - correlated noise on the parameter uncertainties and generally find that they are also in good agreement with the mpfit uncertainties .",
    "we do not use our prayer - bead analysis for the final errors because of the sparsity in the number of data points sampling the light curve which leads to large uncertainties in the estimated errors .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2 ] shows the resultant fit to the white light transit curve with the systematics ( equation [ eq : equation1 ] ) divided out .",
    "in addition to fitting for the systematics within each wavelength bin we also fit each wavelength bin using the  divide - white \" approach which uses fixed detector systematics derived from the white - light transit ( stevenson et al .",
    "2012 ; sing et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we first fit the white light curve as above with the systematics included .",
    "we then subtract the best fit transit light curve from the data leaving a residual vector consisting only of the white - light instrument effects . when fitting the light curves in each wavelength channel we then take this residual systematics vector , multiply it by a scale factor and add an offset .",
    "this new vector is then added to the transit light curve model for that bandpass .",
    "the free parameters when fitting each spectral bin are the eclipse depth , the residual systematics scale factor , and a constant offset for the systematics vector .",
    "this method offers an advantage over the parameterized approach by reducing the number of free parameters required to fit the individual bandpasses .",
    "it also avoids the need to assume a functional form for the systmatic noise , and is therefore more general than the previous approach .",
    "its primary limitation is the assumption that the visit - long linear trend , the ramp timescale , and the orbit - long linear trends are all independent of wavelength .",
    "figure [ fig : figure3 ] shows the eclipses in each wavelength channel with the systmatics removed .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4 ] compares the resultant transmission spectrum from each approach .",
    "the two approaches produce consistent results , but the  divide - white \" fit has modestly reduce the uncertainties on the wavelength - dependent transit depth . for the remainder of the analysis we focus on the transmission spectrum ( table [ tab : table2 ] ) derived from the  divide - white \" approach .",
    "the noise per channel is on average , 1.3 times the photon noise .",
    "the effective resolving power of the spectrum is 60 at 1.4 @xmath7 m and the effective signal - to - noise per wavelength channel is approximately 50 .",
    "we also explored the effects that the uncertainties in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 derived from the white light curve have on the spectrum .",
    "we find that they simply result in a wavelength independent vertical shift , similar to those results found by berta et al .",

    "we consider three scenarios : a solar composition clear atmosphere , a solar composition atmosphere with an opaque gray cloud at 1 mbar , and an atmosphere devoid molecular absorption other than continuum .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume the presence of clouds given the likely possibility of several equilibrium condensates ( e.g. , morley et al .",

    "<S> we present a hst wfc3 transmission spectrum for the transiting exoplanet hat - p-12b . </S>",
    "<S> this warm ( 1000 k ) sub - saturn - mass planet has a smaller mass and a lower temperature than the hot - jupiters that have been studied so far . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the planet s measured transmission spectrum lacks the expected water absorption feature for a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere , and is instead best - described by a model with high - altitude clouds . using a frequentist hypothesis testing procedure , we can rule out a hydrogen - dominated cloud free atmosphere to 4.9@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> when combined with other recent wfc3 studies , our observations suggest that clouds may be common in exo - planetary atmospheres . </S>"
