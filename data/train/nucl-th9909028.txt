    "the description of particle production in hadron - nucleus collision can be considered relatively to an energy scale given by the binding energy of the target  @xcite .",

    "now the reaction mechanism can no longer be considered as an interaction of the projectile with a quasi - free nucleon , but instead as an interaction with the whole nucleus , which might be approximated by the sum over the interactions with one nucleon ( single scattering approximation ) , two nucleons ( two - nucleon current ) and further many - body collisions  @xcite .    in momentum space these many - body effects can be interpreted in terms of high momentum components of the nuclear wave function . as found in ref .",

    "first , the elementary production amplitude is reasonably fixed by recent experimental results from elsa  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the photon illuminates the whole nucleus , so the reaction also occurs deep inside the nuclear interior , while mesonic and baryonic projectiles confine the reaction to the nuclear periphery  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0-mesons only weakly interact with the nuclear medium due to the strangeness conservation and thus the information about the production mechanism does not get distorted significantly .",
    "this is essential , for example , for the study of in - medium self - energies of kaons that are presently being discussed in the framework of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "historically  @xcite , strangeness photoproduction from nuclei is considered as one of the optimal ways to study the formation of hypernuclei  @xcite .",

    "it is the purpose of the present work to provide cross sections for the photoproduction of kaons close to threshold to support later experimental and theoretical studies of in - medium selfenergies of kaons .",
    "since we work close to threshold we are sensitive to details of the energy - momentum distribution in nuclei .",
    "we , therefore , use as in our earlier studies for proton induced reactions  @xcite state of the art nuclear dispersion relations  @xcite . as a byproduct of our calculations",
    "we find that the spectral functions of nucleons can also be obtained from the four - momenta of the produced hyperon and kaon if their final state interactions are small .",

    "@xcite the resonance model reproduces the data well up to @xmath37 invariant masses of @xmath162  gev .",
    "here we do not account for multi - pion production in @xmath140 reactions , which might slightly enhance the contribution from the secondary processes .",
    "since the @xmath131-meson spectra from multi - pion production at @xmath1411  gev are soft  @xcite and have their main strengh essentially below the @xmath142 threshold , we consider our estimate for the contribution from secondary processes as a lower limit .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ gaka2a ] shows the ratio of the @xmath37 production cross section from secondary processes to the contribution from the direct production calculated within the thomas - fermi approximation . at @xmath143",
    "gev the contribution from the two - step reaction mechanism amounts to less than 1% . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ gaka2a ] shows the calculations with the spectral function for comparison .",
    "we thus conclude that the contribution from the two - step process to the @xmath103 reaction is almost negligible at photon energies below 1.2  gev .",
    "in our study on subtreshold meson production from @xmath144 collisions  @xcite it was found that the contribution from secondary pion induced reactions dominates the direct production mechanism .",
    "this finding is different from our present result obtained for the @xmath1 reactions and needs further explanation .",
    "[ gaka2bc]a ) shows the rate of the pion production in @xmath145 and @xmath146 interactions as a function of the projectile momentum .",
    "this rate is defined as a ratio of the @xmath131-meson production cross section to the total reaction cross section .",
    "let us now consider the role of the secondary reaction mechanism at energies below the direct @xmath147 and @xmath148 production thresholds , which are indicated in fig .",
    "[ gaka2bc]a ) by the arrows .",
    "it is clear that near the direct production threshold the @xmath131-meson production rate is almost the same for the @xmath149 and @xmath150 induced reaction .",
    "we thus conclude that the strength of the secondary process at a given projectile momentum is also almost the same for the photon and proton induced reactions on nuclei .",
    "[ gaka2bc]b ) shows the rates of direct @xmath37 production from @xmath145 and @xmath146 reactions as a function of the excess energy @xmath151 . here",
    "@xmath151 is given as the difference between the invariant collision energy and the total mass of the final particle .",
    "both the experimental data and our calculations indicate that the rate of the @xmath4 reaction is substantially ( by about two orders of magnitude ) larger than the @xmath148 rate at energies close to the threshold in free space .",
    "thus the direct @xmath37 production dominates in photon induced reactions on nuclei and the cross section is thus directly sensitive to the spectral function of the nucleon in the target nucleus .",
    "this is an important finding indicating the advantage of @xmath1 reactions in styding the production at energies below the reaction threshold on a free nucleon .",
    "it is presently an open question if the production of heavy mesons such as @xmath52 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 show the same tendency .",
    "we also refer to ref .",
    "@xcite , where a dominance of the direct production mechanism was found for subthreshold @xmath154-meson production in @xmath1 reactions .",
    "we have studied @xmath0-meson production in @xmath24 interactions at energies below the free @xmath155 reaction threshold . the thomas - fermi and spectral function approximation were used in the calculation of the production process .",
    "it was found that these two models result in quite different total and differential cross sections for kaon photoproduction .",
    "the difference between the two models for the target nucleon distribution can be detected in kaon photoproduction not only in the absolute scale , but also in the different shape of the spectra .",
    "the shapes of the transverse momentum spectra calculated with the two models seem to be identical at low transverse momenta @xmath123170  mev / c , but differ substantially at larger @xmath122 .",
    "the large @xmath122 region is sensitive to the details of the spectral function although the contribution from @xmath124170  mev / c to the total @xmath103 cross section is very small .",
    "moreover , we have found that the evaluation of the nuclear spectral function from the @xmath43 data by the @xmath0-meson transverse spectra or the reconstruction of the squared four momentum @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "[ gaka12]b ) ) of the bound nucleon might be possible if the final state interactions of the produced particles are small . as can be seen from fig .",
