    "hydrodynamic surface plasmons above the plasma frequency have also been found theoretically for a planar metal - dielectric interface , for a thin metal slab , and for planar metamaterials.@xcite    it is fruitful to pursue further the analogy between the lsps of our nanospheres and of planar structures .",
    "the analogy is well - known for local response , but the hydrodynamic version holds a surprise . the large-@xmath44 lsp resonances below and above the plasma frequency can both be characterized by wave propagation along the surface of the nanosphere .",
    "the @xmath107 surface mode accommodates exactly @xmath44 oscillation periods along the periphery of the sphere .",
    "one can therefore ascribe an effective surface wavelength @xmath131 and an effective surface wavenumber @xmath132 to the @xmath107 mode . for larger @xmath44 ,",
    "the effective wavelength becomes shorter and the modes perceive the curving surface of the sphere as increasingly flat .",
    "for that reason the dispersion would mimic that of a planar metal - dielectric interface for large @xmath44 .    to test this prediction from the analogy",

    "panel ( c ) depicts contour plots of the absolute value of the hydrodynamic charge density of selected lsp modes in the same nanosphere and in the same plane ( contours separated by factors of 10 with separate , logarithmic color scales ) . ]    for local response , figure  [ fig : pseudodispersion ] indeed shows the well - known result that for larger @xmath44 the dispersion of the nanosphere lsps approaches more and more that of a flat interface .",
    "for nonlocal response , also shown in figure  [ fig : pseudodispersion ] , we first note that the lsp dispersion indeed does not show a transition at the plasma frequency , as we already guessed from figure  [ fig : miecoefs_bulkvsvolume ] .",
    "secondly , there is satisfactory agreement of the hydrodynamic dispersion of lsps for a nanosphere and for the flat interface , so the analogy is also meaningful for hydrodynamic response .",
    "however , and this is the surprising third point , unlike for local response , the agreement does _ not _ converge towards a complete agreement as @xmath44 increases : a discrepancy develops for large @xmath44 .",
    "the discrepancy is larger in figure  [ fig : pseudodispersion](a ) for @xmath137 spheres than for the twice larger spheres in figure  [ fig : pseudodispersion](b ) .",
    "this can be explained by noting that in the lra all the induced free charge resides only _ on _ the surface of the sphere , whereas it is distributed _ close to _ this surface in the hydrodynamic description .",
    "the latter is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pseudodispersion](c ) .",
    "note the surficial standing - wave quantization of the lsps in figure  [ fig : pseudodispersion ] , and also the absence of radial quantization , being associated only with the bulk plasmons as shown in figure  [ fig : miecoefs_bulkfocus_insets ] . for large @xmath44 ,",
    "the neighboring hydrodynamic charge patterns in figure  [ fig : pseudodispersion ] get squeezed into each other due to the finite curvature , producing the discrepancy with the planar interface .",
    "an alternative explanation of the discrepancy as due to interaction across antipodal surface points can be ruled out , since the insets of figures  [ fig : pseudodispersion](a , b ) show that the electric fields corresponding to high-@xmath44 modes are well localized near the surface of the nanosphere , even those above the plasma frequency ( in contrast to predictions of ref .  ) , so that fields on opposite angular regions of the sphere are spatially well separated .",
    "this agrees with recent findings for hydrodynamic lsp modes in a planar thin metal slab , which do not show finite - size effects either for sufficiently large wavevectors .",
    "rather , since the slab has no curvature , the large-@xmath24 dispersion of its lsp modes does indeed agree with that of the single interface.@xcite    [ [ extinction - eels - and - ldos . ] ] extinction , eels , and ldos .",

    "most conspicuous in figure  [ fig : eelsldosext](a ) is perhaps that many new resonances appear in the nonlocal eels and ldos spectra , many more than in extinction , and that drastic changes occur when we vary @xmath155 from the contact scenario @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",

    "we emphasize that one should not view the results in figures  [ fig : eelsldosext](b ) and  [ fig : exteelsldos_1dplot](b ) as being fully representative of experiments : the semi - classical plasma - in - a - box hydrodynamic model necessarily can not contain all relevant physics .",
    "in particular , it is known that the nonlocal blueshift of the _ dipolar _ spp for aluminum spheres in vacuum will be more than fully compensated by a redshift due to electronic spill - out.@xcite    however , for higher - order multipoles we expect that the centroid of the induced charge will be pushed inwards at larger multipole orders , and that nonlocality will come to dominate the effects of spill - out .",
    "these considerations are supported by calculations in ref .",
    "on planar simple - metal surfaces , which show that the induced charge recedes to the interior of the metal at large momentum transfers , equivalent to high multipole order .",
    "this indicates that spill - out does not undo our prediction that higher - order spp resonances will be well - separated due to nonlocal response , and thus suggests a novel direction for identification of hydrodynamic behavior in nanospheres .",
    "the key features of our theoretical near - field spectra for aluminum are encouraging in this respect .",
    "accordingly , experimental investigation and further theoretical study with more microscopic models is highly desirable .    additionally , we note that electronic spill - out is not a property of the metal nanoparticle alone but also of its surrounding dielectric , in a similar way that the atomic spontaneous - emission rate is not a property of the atom alone but also of its electromagnetic environment .",
    "this gives additional experimental freedom : by embedding metal spheres into a solid matrix , electronic spill - out can be controlled and the associated redshift suppressed.@xcite a high - index dielectric surrounding can significantly reduce the electronic spill - out , even in simple metals .",
    "thus with high - index background dielectrics , our plasma - in - a - box model is expected to be more accurate .",
    "the key effects of a non - unity background dielectric function on the spp and bulk - plasmon resonances of figures  [ fig : eelsldosext ] and  [ fig : exteelsldos_1dplot ] can be readily discerned from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : localresonances])([eq : bulkplasmonapproximation ] ) .    as further promising experiments",
    ", we propose to use the same materials as in ref .  , namely potassium ( or na or rb )",
    "nanospheres in an mgo matrix , but now for doing eels on an individual nanosphere , so that inhomogeneous broadening would no longer obscure individual multipolar peaks .",
    "similarly , rather than utilizing a continuous embedding matrix , it may be feasible to suppress the electronic spill - out just by coating the nanospheres with a suitable dielectric , thereby also providing protection from oxidization .",
    "the higher - order lsps that we propose to observe were not seen in the recent eels measurements on silver nanospheres of refs .   and .",
    "this agrees with calculations performed by us for silver , which are detailed in the si : due to strong interband effects , higher - order multipole lsp resonances are obscured even in individual ag nanospheres .    above the plasma frequency",
    ", two hydrodynamic peaks can be seen in the ( identical ) extinction spectra of figures  [ fig : eelsldosext](a ) and  [ fig : exteelsldos_1dplot](a ) .",
    "they clearly have no analogue in the lra , and correspond to the first two dipolar confined bulk plasmon resonances , with labels @xmath116=[1,1]$ ] and @xmath163 $ ] , that we also identified in the hydrodynamic mie ",
    "lorenz coefficients in figure  [ fig : miecoefs_bulkfocus_insets ] .",
    "they have first been predicted by ruppin to exist in the extinction spectrum.@xcite interestingly , in the eels and ldos spectra of figures  [ fig : eelsldosext ] and [ fig : exteelsldos_1dplot ] , we see more resonances above the plasma frequency than the two dipolar bulk plasmons of the extinction spectrum . according to our investigations of the mie ",
    "lorenz coefficients in figures  [ fig : miecoefs_bulkfocus_insets ] and  [ fig : pseudodispersion ] , these additional resonances in principle could be either high-@xmath44 lsp resonances or quadrupolar and higher - order bulk plasmon resonances .",
    "they all turn out to be bulk plasmons , and are therefore labeled accordingly ; the high-@xmath44 lsp resonances are much weaker and absent in the spectrum .",
    "better than observing shifts in lsp peaks , observing the confined bulk plasmon peaks would constitute a unique identification of hydrodynamic pressure waves in nanospheres .",
    "however , since we find them to be three orders of magnitude weaker than the dipolar lsp resonance , actually the same order of magnitude weaker as found in recent density - functional calculations,@xcite they are difficult to measure in nanospheres . to our knowledge",
    "they have not yet been observed ( unlike their counterparts in thin films ) , so to date bulk plasmons are `` non - smoking guns '' of hydrodynamic pressure waves in nanospheres .",
    "overall , figures  [ fig : eelsldosext ] and  [ fig : exteelsldos_1dplot ] illustrate the importance of the dimensionality of the excitation source .",
    "as is well known , the plane wave used in extinction measurements only excites dipole resonances in deeply subwavelength spheres . as to the eels",
    "spectra , the one - dimensional source of a travelling electron excites a cylinder - like field , which for short probe - to - surface separations is sufficiently inhomogeneous to excite higher - order ( @xmath164 ) plasmons as well .",
    "lastly , the ldos spectra illustrate the largest sensitivity to the multipole modes , with all lsps discernible and significant response from several bulk plasmon orders .",
    "the spherical - like field of the zero - dimensional dipole induces locally a more inhomogeneous excitation field than the traveling electron , thus accounting for the increased multipole - sensitivity in ldos compared to eels . at large probe - surface separations shown in figure  [ fig : eelsldosext ] , the exciting fields in both eels and ldos are almost homogeneous near the sphere , and the response due to higher - order multipoles is diminished . as a consequence , for large probe - to - surface separations",
    "the spectral response in extinction , eels , and ldos is qualitatively the same .",
    "see si for analytical considerations of this latter point , regarding the asymptotics of the ldos and eels spectra .",
    "_ distance - dependence of ldos .",
    "_ in the preceding sections we established that the response of high - order plasmons is significantly enhanced with probes of low - dimensionality when examined in the near - field , where the observability of multipolar lsps is enhanced by hydrodynamics itself .",
    "let us therefore finally focus solely on the ldos spectra , where the response of these high - order multipoles is most pronounced . in figure",
    "[ fig : ldos_bvar ]    ( a ) , for a @xmath165 sphere . ]",
    "we display the variation of the ldos spectra as a function of the probe - to - surface separation , varying from @xmath156 ( _ i.e. _ , source on surface ) to @xmath166 ( @xmath167 separation ) .",
    "for the panels with @xmath168 , contributions from high - order multipoles are increasingly important , as the excitation of multiple lsp orders contribute to the spectrum@xcite .",
    "consequently , in the lra the largest ldos occurs at @xmath118 , the limiting frequency of the high - order lsps , coinciding with the pile - up of lra multipoles .",
    "by contrast , the hydrodynamically blueshifted lsps do not have a finite limiting frequency or an associated similar pile - up of modes , but instead exhibit distinguishable peaks associated with excitation of different multipoles . the qualitative discrepancy between local and nonlocal spectra is even substantial . for larger spheres ,",
    "the multipole peaks merge and instead give rise to a broadband enhancement above @xmath11 , even extending beyond the plasma frequency , see si for supporting calculations on an @xmath169 sphere .",
    "this suggests an hitherto largely unexplored regime of studying nonlocal response in comparatively large nanostructures but at short surface - to - probe separations .",
    "as is well known , in the extreme limit @xmath170 the lra ldos diverges ( hence not shown ) due to the @xmath171 scaling of the nonradiative decay rate . for the @xmath156 panel of figure  [ fig : ldos_bvar ]",
    "we obtain convergent results for the hydrodynamic response , and associated finite ldos spectra .",
    "the convergence , however , hinges upon the choice of a simple drude - metal with real - valued @xmath172 , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "as such , hydrodynamic response does not fully regularize the divergence of the ldos for real metals with dissipative bound response .",
    "complete regularization in real metals would likely necessitate an appropriate nonlocal treatment of not only the free response , but also the bound response .",
    "in addition , for these very close proximities between source and nanosphere , the effect of high - order moments - beyond the dipole  of the source itself , due to the finite size of the source , would certainly modify the decay rates as well.@xcite for emitters at the larger separations , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the panel with @xmath173 , the dipole mode of the nanosphere is again the primary feature , but with the quadrupolar lsp still imposing a significant spectral feature .",
    "in this paper we have aimed to identify indisputable signatures of hydrodynamic response in plasmonic nanospheres .",
    "the corresponding evidence for layered systems is the observation , found both with light@xcite and with electrons,@xcite of confined bulk plasmons in thin films . employing the hydrodynamic drude model we predict the existence of confined bulk plasmons also in nanospheres .",
    "an important question then , is whether such excitations would be observable .",
    "a series of confined bulk plasmons of dipolar character has been predicted before to show up in extinction spectra.@xcite here we additionally found that besides the dipole series , also series of quadrupolar and higher - order bulk plasmons emerge in near - field eels and ldos spectra .",
    "however , we find the strength of these bulk plasmon resonances in nanospheres to be about three orders of magnitude weaker than the dominant lsp peak . their experimental observation in nanospheres , for example with eels or ldos , remains an open challenge .",
    "another promising technique is core - level photoemission.@xcite    of a more immediate , accessible nature experimentally , is our prediction that in the near - field eels and ldos spectra also quadrupolar and higher - order lsps appear , besides the well - known dominant dipolar lsps . in itself",
    "it is no surprise that higher - order lsps show up in near - field spectra , since already the lra predicts them@xcite .",
    "the salient point here is that lra lsps exhibit the surface plasmon @xmath11 of a planar interface as a limiting upper frequency , while we predict hydrodynamic lsps to be observable also above @xmath11 .",
    "this follows from our prediction that higher-@xmath44 plasmons exhibit a larger nonlocal blueshift .",
    "indeed , we found that high-@xmath44 lsps in principle can occur above the plasma frequency in few - nanometer spheres , with their mode profiles still well bound to the surface .",
    "an upper limiting frequency for lsps actually does not exist in the hydrodynamic model",
    ".    not all multipolar lsps will be observable , though . for silver",
    ", we predict all lsps besides the dipolar one to be suppressed due to interband effects .",
    "on the other hand , we predict that for aluminum nanospheres several higher - order lsps should be observable in near - field eels and ldos spectra . in ensembles of alkali metal ( na , k , rb ) nanospheres in an mgo matrix ,",
    "resonances above the lra limit @xmath11 have actually already been observed , but individual resonance peaks could not be resolved due to ensemble averaging.@xcite we propose to do these measurements on individual alkali metal nanospheres , something that has already been achieved with silver nanospheres.@xcite    would such measurements constitute the unequivocal evidence , the `` smoking gun '' , of hydrodynamic nonlocal response in nanospheres that we set out to identify ?",
    "we can only suggest ` perhaps ' at this stage , because alternative explanations for resonances above @xmath11 do exist .",
    "in particular , vom felde _",
    "invoke quantum confinement ( cluster physics ) rather than hydrodynamics ( nanoplasmonics ) to explain their intriguing observation of resonances above the lra limit.@xcite it is safe to assume , however , that fitting the two distinct models to a measured series of lsp resonances will be more conclusive than fitting only the dominant dipolar lsp , which remains state of the art.@xcite we therefore suggest to measure near - field eels and ldos spectra of nanospheres of aluminum and alkali metals embedded in a solid dielectric environment .",
    "the plasmonic resonances emerge with strikingly different weights in the three types of spectra that we calculated , so that for example the state - of - the - art comparison of eels experiments with theoretical absorption cross sections@xcite or extinction cross sections@xcite can be of limited use .",
    "the comparison happened to be useful for silver nanospheres,@xcite where interband effects suppress the beyond - dipole lsp resonances that otherwise would show up in near - field eels and ldos experiments .",
    "even for the relatively simple hydrodynamic theory that we used here , the near - field spectra of nanospheres become rather elaborate and rich  but they can be understood rigorously .",

    "<S> inspired by recent measurements on individual metallic nanospheres that can not be explained with traditional classical electrodynamics , we theoretically investigate the effects of nonlocal response by metallic nanospheres in three distinct settings : atomic spontaneous emission , electron energy loss spectroscopy , and light scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these constitute two near - field and one far - field measurements , with zero- , one- , and two - dimensional excitation sources , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we search for the clearest signatures of hydrodynamic pressure waves in nanospheres . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a linearized hydrodynamic model and mie  lorenz theory is applied for each case . </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal response shows its mark in all three configurations , but for the two near - field measurements we predict especially pronounced nonlocal effects that are not exhibited in far - field measurements . </S>",
    "<S> associated with every multipole order is not only a single blueshifted surface plasmon , but also an infinite series of bulk plasmons that has no counterpart in a local - response approximation . we show that these increasingly blueshifted multipole plasmons become spectrally more prominent at shorter probe - to - surface separations and for decreasing nanosphere radii . for selected metals we predict hydrodynamic multipolar plasmons to be measurable on single nanospheres .    </S>",
    "<S> * keywords : * nonlocal response , nanoplasmonics , eels , extinction , ldos , spontaneous emission , multipole plasmons . 1em    ' '' ''    1em a plethora of effects arises in structured metals due to collective excitations of conduction electrons and their interaction with the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes plasmonics , a research field with mature roots@xcite that is continuing to develop strongly.@xcite notably , applications for plasmonics are found in the biochemistry and biomedical fields , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers),@xcite biosensing@xcite and biomedical imaging,@xcite drug delivery,@xcite and phototherapy of cancer - cells.@xcite purely photonic applications are also emerging , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in plasmonic waveguiding,@xcite optical nanoantennas@xcite , and photovoltaics.@xcite    recent years advances in fabrication , synthesis , and characterization techniques have allowed well - controlled experimental investigations of plasmonics even at the nanoscale . yet in this growing field of nanoplasmonics,@xcite the commonly employed theory for light - matter interaction is still traditional classical electrodynamics , where the response of the material constituents to light is described collectively in terms of local , bulk - material response - functions . indeed , this approach usually remains very accurate , even for sub - wavelength phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , recent measurements on individual few - nanometer plasmonic particles have shown phenomena that are clearly beyond classical electrodynamics . electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) of ag spheres resting on dielectric substrates showed surface plasmon resonance blueshifts up to @xmath0 as compared to classical theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> earlier similar measurements were performed on ensembles of nanoparticles.@xcite classical electrodynamics was also shown to fail in experiments involving ( sub-)nanometer - sized gaps between dimers,@xcite or between nanoparticles and a substrate.@xcite    to explain these features arising beyond the validity of classical electrodynamics , various physical mechanisms are invoked . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , classical electrodynamics assumes a step - function profile of the free - electron density at a metal - dielectric interface . </S>",
    "<S> the finite quantum mechanical spill - out@xcite of the electron density redshifts the surface plasmon resonance,@xcite may give rise to nonresonant field enhancement,@xcite and may enable charge transfer between non - touching plasmonic dimers.@xcite secondly , a stronger confinement of the free electrons gives rise to blueshifts . in cluster physics , it is single - particle excitations that are blueshifted due to quantum confinement,@xcite while confinement in nanoplasmonics blueshifts collective resonances and gives rise to friedel oscillations in the electron density.@xcite a third , semi - classical physical mechanism beyond classical electrodynamics is nonlocal response , discussed in more detail below , which becomes important when reducing the particle size or gap size of a dimer down to the range of the nonlocality@xcite ( @xmath1 , denoting the spatial extent of significant nonlocal interaction , to be introduced shortly ) , and blueshifts surface plasmon resonance frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> large experimental blueshifts of the localized surface plasmon ( lsp ) dipole resonance seem to indicate that several physical mechanisms add up.@xcite certainly , in experiments all these physical mechanisms beyond traditional classical electrodynamics are at work simultaneously , thus emphasizing the importance of microscopic theories@xcite ( _ e.g. _ , density - functional theory , dft ) or effective models@xcite that incorporate multiple mechanisms . yet at the same time it is important to ascertain the relative strength and compatibility of the various mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is paramount to know - and to measure - the unique characteristics of each mechanism , that is to say , find their individual `` smoking guns '' , in order to appreciate the dominant physical mechanisms under different nonstandard circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> we foresee an increasing number of such decisive experiments on individual nanoparticles in the near future .    </S>",
    "<S> the boundary between cluster physics and nanoplasmonics is an interesting one . </S>",
    "<S> metal clusters require a quantum description of interacting electron states , often studied with dft . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , nanoplasmonics could be defined to start for nanoparticle sizes that allow an effective quantum description in terms of non - interacting plasmons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a current interesting issue is where to place the origin of the observed blueshift of the surface plasmon resonance of individual nanospheres : is it primarily due to quantum confinement of single - particle states,@xcite or due to confinement of collective modes?@xcite in this article we assume the latter and identify new observable consequences . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on nanoparticles that are considered large enough ( @xmath2 nm ) that so - called core plasmons , although collective in nature , can be neglected according to dft calculations.@xcite    nonlocal response is a semi - classical effect which emerges in nanoplasmonics at few - nanometer length scales . </S>",
    "<S> the general nonlocal relation between the displacement and electric fields , @xmath3 becomes simpler and more familiar in the local - response approximation ( lra ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in many cases this approximation provides an excellent effective description due to the short - range nature of the nonlocal interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the lra is not justifiable when the nonlocal interaction length , @xmath1 , becomes comparable with characteristic feature sizes of structural or optical kind.@xcite    here we consider inclusion of the classically neglected fermi  dirac pressure of the electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> its associated pressure waves give rise to a nonlocal optical response . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest way to study the effects of fermi pressure in nanoplasmonics is by assuming a hydrodynamic model,@xcite which neglects the aforementioned spill - out and confinement effects on the static electron density . in hydrodynamics </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal interaction length becomes @xmath5 , with @xmath6{3\\pi^2n_0}/m$ ] denoting the fermi velocity , defined through the effective mass @xmath7 and free - electron density @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to @xmath1-values in the range @xmath9 for typical plasmonic metals at optical frequencies , see table s1 in the supporting information ( si ) </S>",
    "<S> . we will focus on the linearized hydrodynamic model here , but would like to emphasize that the full hydrodynamic model involves both nonlocality and nonlinearity , predicting nonlinear effects such as second - harmonic generation at the surface of metal nanoparticles for larger field - strengths@xcite .    the strongest evidence of hydrodynamic behavior in metals originate from experiments on thin metal films , where resonances due to standing waves of confined bulk plasmons have been identified , in silver by lindau and nilsson@xcite , in potassium by anderegg _ </S>",
    "<S> _ et al.__@xcite , in magnesium by chen@xcite , and very recently by \" ozer _ _ et al.__@xcite rather surprisingly , \" ozer _ _ et al.__@xcite could measure confined bulk plasmon resonances ( _ i.e. _ , standing fermi pressure waves ) even for ultrathin magnesium films of only three atomic monolayers , and found qualitative agreement with theory even when neglecting electronic spill - out . for nanospheres on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the observations of blueshifted dipole - resonances of localized surface plasmons ( lsps ) in individual nanospheres@xcite and of broad resonance - features above the plasma frequency in ensembles,@xcite tentatively suggested as associated with confined bulk plasmons,@xcite are perhaps less conclusive evidence of hydrodynamic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this may in part be due to a line of reasoning which addresses just a single resonance , namely the dipole .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim in this article is then to examine theoretically which phenomena constitute the clearest evidence of hydrodynamic pressure waves in plasmonic nanospheres , and how best to observe them . </S>",
    "<S> powerful measurement techniques include scattering measurements , as realized _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in the infrared regime by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) , scanning near - field optical microscopy ( snom)@xcite , eels@xcite , and fluorescence microscopy techniques , utilizing decay enhancement of emitters near plasmonic resonances@xcite . in this theoretical article , we systematically explore three prominent measurement techniques , each with different excitation sources , namely the extinction cross - section , the eels probability , and the electric local density of states ( ldos ) . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation sources are , respectively , a linearly polarized plane wave , a traveling electron with kinetic energy in the @xmath10-range , and an electric dipole emitter , corresponding to a two- , one- , and zero - dimensional source . </S>",
    "<S> the three measurement principles represent both far- and near - field types , and we show their spectra to be qualitatively different .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate not only the strongest ( dipolar ) lsp resonance of nanospheres , but also higher - order multipole lsps , as well as bulk plasmons , for all three measurements considered . </S>",
    "<S> we show that hydrodynamic response leads to a significant spectral separation of the sphere s multipole plasmons at small radii , allowing them to extend above the lra asymptotic limit at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> resonance - features above this limit have already been observed in polydisperse ensembles of nanospheres , and previously been interpreted instead in terms of single - particle confinement.@xcite we find significant qualitative disparity between properties measurable in the far - field , _ i.e. _ , _ via _ extinction , and in the near - field , _ i.e. _ , _ via _ eels or ldos . </S>",
    "<S> our findings result in concrete suggestions to experimentally observe hydrodynamic nonlocal phenomena in the near - field , by identifying the multipolar plasmon resonances of individual nanospheres of selected metals . </S>"
