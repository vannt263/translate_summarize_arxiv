    "this high - luminosity tail can be approximated by a power - law , @xmath3 , which gives a space density for the most luminous infrared sources well in excess of predictions based on the optical lf .",

    "this implies that the millimeter cib is not due to the millimeter emission of the galaxies that account for the peak of the cib ( @xmath14 m ) .",

    "+ the stacking anlysis also allows for the first time to obtain average seds of galaxies from z=0 to z  2 by stacking the 24 @xmath10 m galaxies per redshift bin in the chandra deep field south , using the redshifts derived by caputi et al .",
    "the derived seds confirm the strong luminosity evolution from z=0 to 2 ( as shown in the next section ) .",
    "the observed colors can be qualitatively explained by dusty ir luminous galaxies with an important dust component .",
    "comparison with models is provided in dole et al .",
    "another remarkable property of the ir sources is their extremely high rates of evolution with redshift exceeding those measured for galaxies at other wavelengths and comparable to or larger than the evolution rates observed for quasars . as an example , number counts at 15 @xmath15 m show a prominent bump peaking at about 0.4  mjy . at the peak of the bump ,",
    "the counts are one order of magnitude above the non - evolution models .",
    "in fact , data require a combination of a ( 1+z)@xmath61 luminosity evolution and ( 1+z)@xmath61 density evolution for the starburst component at redshift lower than 0.9 to fit the strong evolution . although it has not been possible with isocam to probe in detail the evolution of the infrared luminosity function , _ spitzer _ data at 24  @xmath15 m give for the first time tight constraints up to redshift 1.2 ( le floch et al .",
    "2005 ; prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "a strong evolution is noticeable and requires a shift of the characteristic luminosity l@xmath62 by a factor ( 1+z)@xmath63 .",
    "le floch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that the lirgs and ulirgs become the dominant population contributing to the comoving infrared energy density beyond @xmath360.5 - 0.6 and represent 70% of the star - forming activity at @xmath361 .",
    "the comoving luminosity density produced by luminous infrared galaxies was more than 10 times larger at @xmath361 than in the local universe . for comparison ,",
    "the b - band luminosity density was only three times larger at @xmath40 than today .",
    "such a large number density of lirgs in the distant universe could be caused by episodic and violent star - formation events , superimposed on relatively small levels of star formation activity .",
    "these events can be associated to major changes in the galaxy morphologies .",
    "the rapid decline of the luminosity density from @xmath40 is only partially due to the decreasing frequency of major merger events .",
    "bell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the sfr density at @xmath360.7 is dominated by morphologically normal spiral , e / s0 and irregular galaxies ( @xmath2170% ) , while clearly interacting galaxies account for @xmath430% .",
    "the dominent driver of the decline is a strong decrease in sfr in morphologically undisturbed galaxies .",
    "this could be due , for example , to gas consumption or to the decrease of weak interactions with small satellites that could trigger the star formation through bars and spiral arms .",
    "+ at still higher redshifts , the infrared luminosity of the sources that dominate the background is larger than @xmath64 .",
    "this is a population with a very different infrared luminosity function than the local or even the @xmath40 luminosity function .",
    "the global evolution of the ir energy output with redshift is illustrated on figure [ fig : iroutput ] .",
    "a number of conclusions are now clear from the analysis of the identified sources in the cib :    @xmath11 the comoving energy produced in the past that makes up the cib at different wavelengths is more uniform that what is suggested by its spectral energy distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cib at long wavelengths ( @xmath65 m ) is dominated by emission from the peak of the sed of galaxies at high @xmath9 .",
    "more quantitatively , the isocam surveys reveal that about two - thirds of the cib emission at @xmath66150 @xmath10 m is generated by lirgs at @xmath67 . at 850  @xmath10 m",
    ", more than half of the submillimeter cib is generated by smgs .",
    "the brightest smgs ( @xmath683 mjy , @xmath830% of the cib ) are ulirgs at a median redshift of 2.2 . the energy density at 150  @xmath10 m , which is @xmath820 - 25 times larger than the energy density at 850  @xmath10 m requires a comoving energy production rate at @xmath69 roughly 10 times the energy production rate at @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath11 the evolution exhibited by lirgs and ulirgs is much faster than for optically selected galaxies .",
    "the ratio of infrared to optical , volume - averaged output of galaxies increases rapidly with increasing redshift .",
    "@xmath11 agn activity is very common in the most luminous of these galaxies even though this activity does not dominate the energy output . the rate and fraction of the energy produced increase with the luminosity .",
    "@xmath11 lirgs at @xmath71 are dominated by interacting massive late - type galaxies .",
    "they seem to be starburst phases of already - built massive , late - type field galaxies accreting gas or gas - rich companions forming the disks .",
    "we see today a rapid decrease of this activity probably associated with a dry out of the gas reservoir in their vicinity .",
    "the larger redshift ir galaxies ( @xmath72 ) , which are also more luminous , seem to belong to more massive complex systems involving major merging .",
    "these systems could be located in the rare larger amplitude peaks of the large - scale structures leading to massive elliptical galaxies at the center of rich clusters .",
    "@xmath11 lirgs and ulirgs can not be identified with any of the distant populations found by rest - frame ultraviolet and optical surveys .",
    "+ although these findings are answering the basic questions about the sources that make up the cib , there are still observational difficulties to be overcome to complete these answers .",
    "the seds of lirgs and ulirgs are quite variable and often not very well constrained in their ratio of far - infrared to mid - infrared or to submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the far - infrared , where most of the energy is radiated , requires cryogenically cooled telescopes .",
    "these have small diameters and , hence , poor angular resolution and severe confusion limits for blind surveys .",
    "establishing proper seds for the different classes of infrared galaxies detected either in mid - infrared ( with isocam at 15  @xmath10 m or mips at 24  @xmath10 m ) or in millimeter - submillimeter surveys is one of the challenges of the coming decade . making sure that no class of sources that contribute significantly to the cib at any wavelength has been missed is an other observational challenge .",
    "the submillimeter galaxies not found through the radio - selected sources and the question of the warm submillimeter galaxies are also two of those challenges .",
