    "in recent years , a lot of work has been devoted to the understanding of the parton distributions inside highly energetic hadrons or nuclei ( see @xcite for a pedagogical introduction ) .",
    "a central question in this field is the issue of parton saturation at small values of the momentum fraction @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the bfkl equation @xcite , when applied to extremely small values of @xmath0 , leads to cross - sections that are too large to be compatible with unitarity constrains .",
    "it has been argued that this description becomes inadequate when non - linear effects in qcd become important , which happens when the phase - space density reaches the order of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a theoretical description of saturation is provided by the model introduced by mclerran and venugopalan @xcite , in which small-@xmath0 gluons inside a fast moving nucleus are described by a classical color field , which is motivated by the large occupation number of the corresponding modes .",
    "the color field is determined by the classical yang - mills equation with a current induced by the partons at large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of hard color sources inside the nucleus is determined by a functional density which is assumed to be gaussian in the original form of the model .",
    "this physical picture has been named `` colored glass condensate '' . when quantum corrections are taken into account",
    ", the density distribution evolves according to a functional evolution equation @xcite which reduces in special cases to the bfkl equation .",
    "it is interesting to note that this evolution equation was recently reobtained in the dipole picture @xcite , which is the natural description in the frame where the nucleus is at rest .",
    "the classical version of the color glass condensate model contains only one parameter , called `` saturation scale '' @xmath2 , and defined as the transverse momentum scale below which saturation effects start being important .",
    "this scale increases with energy and with the size of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "therefore , at energies high enough so that @xmath3 , the coupling constant at the saturation scale is small , which makes perturbative approaches feasible .",
    "note that another model inspired by saturation has also been developed by golec - biernat and wusthoff in order to fit the hera data @xcite .",
    "there , saturation is included via a phenomenological formula for the dipole cross - section @xmath4 that saturates for large dipole sizes .",
    "the radius @xmath5 is the dipole size above which the saturation occurs , and is taken to be of the form @xmath6gev@xmath7 .",
    "a fit to inclusive data at small @xmath0 gave @xmath8 mb , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . this phenomenological model has also been successfully applied to the description of diffractive hera data @xcite .",
    "the main differences between this model and the colored glass condensate model are two - fold : in the model by golec - biernat and wusthoff , saturation is introduced by hand , and the @xmath0 evolution of the saturation scale is also ad hoc . in the colored glass condensate , saturation emerges explicitly as a consequence of solving the fully non - linear classical yang - mills equations , and the quantum evolution is described by an evolution equation that may lead in principle to an @xmath0 dependence much more complicated than a power law .",
    "one may also note the attempts @xcite to fill the gap between the phenomenological approach of golec - biernat and wusthoff and perturbative qcd , by using perturbative qcd as a starting point and adding shadowing corrections _ a la _ glauber - mueller .",
    "saturation effects , and in particular the color glass condensate model can be tested in deep inelastic scattering experiments by measuring structure functions like @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it also leads to potentially observable effects in the field of heavy ion collisions .",
    "for central collisions , the colored glass condensate model has been used to compute the distribution of the gluons produced initially , both analytically @xcite and numerically on a 2-dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "this initial gluon multiplicity is expected to control directly the observed final multiplicity .",
    "recently , we have shown @xcite that the parton saturation leads to interesting effects also in peripheral collisions , where it can be probed via the photoproduction of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "in particular , the saturation scale @xmath2 controls directly the position of the maximum in the transverse momentum spectrum of the pairs .",
    "the present paper is an extension of this previous work , where we study the _ diffractive _ photoproduction of quark - antiquark pairs in peripheral heavy ion collisions . by diffractive production ,",
    "we mean events in which the nuclei remain intact , and with a rapidity gap between the nuclei and the produced objects characterizing the topology of the final state .",
    "this implies that the exchange between the color field and the quark pair is color singlet , and carries a vanishing total transverse momentum . the simplest diagram for this process",
    "is represented in figure [ fig : proto ] .",
    "we consider large ultra - relativistic nuclei , and we take into account the electromagnetic interaction to lowest order in the coupling ( or , equivalently , in the leading logarithmic approximation ) , and the interactions with the strong color background field to all orders . we find that the cross - section of this process is very sensitive to the value of the saturation scale in the colored glass condensate .",
    "note that we use a gaussian distribution in order to describe the hard color sources that are generating the classical color fields .",
    "this means that no quantum evolution has been included in this calculation .",
    "it is known that in the colored glass condensate model , the quantum corrections lead to a modification of the distribution function of hard sources when the energy increases @xcite ( a similar evolution equation has been derived by kovchegov and levin in the dipole language @xcite , and has been recently shown to be equivalent to the evolution equation in the colored glass condensate by mueller @xcite ) . in general , this distribution will not keep a gaussian form due to these corrections .",
    "however , in order to assess very simply saturation effects in diffractive ultra - peripheral collisions , we do not include this refinement here .",
    "note that in principle , extending our calculation to include quantum evolution is just a matter of changing the correlator @xmath12 that appears in our results ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - c ] ) for instance ) and contains all the information about the properties of the colored glass condensate by one that has been calculated with the evolved distribution of `` hard sources '' .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : p1 ] , we summarize results relevant for the calculation of particle production in a classical background field .",
    "we also recall how to calculate diffractive quantities in the mclerran - venugopalan model . in section [ sec : lowest - order ]",
    ", we compute the pair production amplitude to lowest order in the electromagnetic coupling constant . in section [ sec",
    ": kt - spectrum ] , an expression for the transverse momentum spectrum of the components of the pair is derived , and in section [ sec : cross - section ] results for the integrated diffractive cross - section are presented .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we remind the reader of reduction formulas one can use to compute various physical quantities in a classical background field .",
    "the formalism was derived in @xcite , and here we are only going to recall the results , using similar notations .",
    "different from the situation studied in @xcite , the relevant classical background field is now a superposition of an electromagnetic field and a color field .",
    "the color field is associated to the covariant gauge distribution of hard sources @xmath13 ( see section 2 of @xcite ) . in order to calculate physical quantities",
    ", one has to average over an ensemble distribution of these sources .",
    "quantities obtained before averaging over the sources will be denoted by an index @xmath13 .",
    "certain quantities of interest for the problem of quark - antiquark production in a background field can be related to quark propagators with different boundary conditions in this background field @xcite .",
    "the main results are the following .",
    "the probability to produce _ exactly one _ @xmath16 pair in a background field can be related to the _ feynman _ ( or time - ordered ) propagator of a quark via @xmath17=|\\left<0_{\\rm out}|0_{\\rm in}\\right>_{[\\widetilde{\\rho}]}|^2\\ , \\int { { d^3{\\imb q}}\\over{(2\\pi)^3 2\\omega_{\\imb q } } } { { d^3{\\imb p}}\\over{(2\\pi)^3 2\\omega_{\\imb p } } } \\left| \\overline{u}({\\imb q } ) { \\cal t}_f^{[\\widetilde{\\rho}]}(q ,-",

    "conversely , the _ average number _ of @xmath16 pairs produced in a background field , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the production probabilities , can be expressed in terms of the interacting part of the _ retarded _ propagator of a quark in this background : @xmath25= \\int { { d^3{\\imb q}}\\over{(2\\pi)^3 2\\omega_{\\imb q } } } { { d^3{\\imb p}}\\over{(2\\pi)^3 2\\omega_{\\imb p } } } \\left| \\overline{u}({\\imb q } ) { \\cal t}_r^{[\\widetilde{\\rho}]}(q ,-",

    "\\label{eq : nbar - def}\\ ] ] another difference to eq .",
    "( [ eq : p1-def ] ) is the absence of the vacuum - to - vacuum factor .    for the background field of two nuclei in peripheral collisions ,",
    "an interesting aspect is that in the ultra - relativistic limit the retarded propagator has a much simpler structure than the feynman propagator @xcite .",
    "this enables one to write the retarded propagator of a quark explicitly , while this is not possible for the time - ordered one .",
    "so far , we have given the expression for quantities that would be observed for the background field configuration associated to a specific source @xmath13 .",
    "however , this is not what is measured in experiments where quantities are usually averaged over many collisions . in the colored glass condensate model , this translates into an average over the sources , which are assumed to have a gaussian distribution in the classical version of the model .",

    "it means that the process under consideration is : @xmath28 ( the nucleus interacting electromagnetically , denoted by @xmath29 , remains intact , while the other nucleus may fragment ) .",
    "it was also noted that one can obtain a diffractive quantity ( i.e.  for events where the nucleus @xmath30 does not break up ) by averaging the _ amplitude _ over the sources @xmath13 before squaring it in order to get a probability .",
    "this procedure has been outlined in @xcite and justified in @xcite . the difference between the two ways of performing the average",
    "is illustrated in figure [ fig : diffrac ] , where the shaded blob indicates an average over the color sources .",
    "this average has the property that the gluons attached to one such blob carry a zero total transverse momentum and no net color .",
    "given this , it is intuitive that the nucleus remains intact in the final state ( i.e.  on the cut represented by a dashed line ) for the right diagram .",
    "in addition , this condition leads to a rapidity gap between the nucleus and the @xmath16 pair .",

( [ eq : nbar - def ] ) , therefore , only the average number of pairs produced in a collision , regardless of what happens to the nucleus , can be calculated @xcite . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we focus on the calculation of @xmath33 .",
    "the results of the previous section are valid to all orders in the coupling constants occurring in the problem , in particular the electromagnetic coupling @xmath35 of a quark with charge @xmath36 ( in units of the positron charge ) to the nucleus with atomic number @xmath29 . however , the feynman propagator and the vacuum - to - vacuum amplitude are not known to all orders in @xmath37 , even in the ultra - relativistic limit ( see @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "we show that results can be obtained in closed form if one works at the lowest non - trivial order in @xmath37 , but to all orders in the interactions with the strong color field of the other nucleus .",
    "although the value of @xmath37 might seem too large ( @xmath38 for a gold nucleus ) as a useful expansion parameter , it turns out that at leading order the production probabilities contain large logarithms whose argument is the center of mass energy of the collision . it can be shown that higher order terms in @xmath37 are suppressed by at least one power of this large logarithm , which justifies the approximation for large enough collision energies .",

    "this is indeed the case if the transition of @xmath84 from 0 to 1 is sharp , i.e.  if we can neglect surface effects in the description of the nucleus .",

    "i.e.  for photons with a transverse momentum @xmath123 smaller than @xmath98 , we can perform a taylor expansion of the factor @xmath124 around the point where @xmath125 . up to terms of higher order , this gives @xmath126 with @xmath127 thanks to the sum rule ] ] @xmath128 the term of order zero in the expansion ( [ eq : m lin ] ) does not contribute . integrating over the photon momentum @xmath129 , while keeping @xmath100 fixed , leads to @xmath130}({\\imb p},{\\imb q})\\right>_{\\widetilde{\\rho}}=2iz\\alpha e_q \\widetilde{\\cal p}({\\imb",

    "the next step is to perform the integration over the transverse momentum of the produced quarks , in order to obtain total cross - sections or production probabilities .",
    "this can be done numerically , and the results are plotted in figure [ fig : dsdy ] as a function of @xmath150 , for strange , charm , and bottom quarks .",
    "again , the lorentz factor is taken to be @xmath149 .",
    "we can see that the cross - section for the production of @xmath151 and @xmath152 pairs is very sensitive to the value of the saturation scale @xmath2 , especially in the range @xmath153 $ ] .",
    "therefore , this process could be used as a way to measure the saturation scale for ultra - relativistic heavy nuclei .",
    "it is interesting to investigate explicitly the inequality ( [ eq : inequal ] ) between the diffractive @xmath16 production probability @xmath33 and the inclusive probability @xmath154 ( which at leading order in @xmath37 is equal to @xmath14 calculated in @xcite ) .",
    "the probability can easily be obtained from the expression for the respective cross - section by integrating over the rapidity , but without performing the integration over the impact parameter .",
    "note that assuming @xmath155 in our present approach leads to a flat rapidity distribution , and a cutoff in rapidity must be introduced by hand . for the numerical calculation ,",
    "we assume and @xmath156 , it has only an influence on the size of the unitarization corrections . ] a rapidity range of @xmath157 , which leads to the relation @xmath158^{-1 }   \\frac{d\\sigma_1^{\\rm diff}}{dy}\\ ] ] between the probability at the smallest possible impact parameter and the cross - section . in figure",
    "[ fig : upper - limit - check ] , we have displayed @xmath14 , @xmath159 and @xmath33 , at @xmath160 and for a lorentz factor @xmath149 , as functions of @xmath150 for strange and charm quarks .",
    "as expected , we always find @xmath161 .",
    "we also observe that the two quantities tend to a common value as @xmath2 becomes large . indeed , in the mclerran - venugopalan model the black - disc limit corresponds to an infinitely large value of the saturation scale .",
    "we have already emphasized the importance of the prefactor @xmath162 , to ensure that the obtained probabilities are smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "however , in the present calculation , in which we have kept only the terms of lowest order in @xmath37 , this factor is approximated by @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , it is expected that this approximation violates unitarity , and that unitarity is restored by terms of higher order in the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "these corrections are rather difficult to calculate exactly . for a rough estimate of their size",
    ", we suppose that the diffractive multiplicities have a poissonian distribution , and that the unitarized probability to create one pair diffractively is given by @xmath163 .",
    "this expression is also plotted in figure [ fig : upper - limit - check ] .",
    "we see that the unitarization effects ( i.e.  the higher order corrections in @xmath37 ) are not important as long as the average multiplicity is much smaller than one .",
    "in particular , we estimate that the unitarity corrections remain small in the range of values of @xmath2 expected to be relevant at rhic or at lhc ( between @xmath40 and @xmath164gev ) .",
    "we also emphasize the fact that this estimate has been done for the probabilities at the smallest allowed impact parameter @xmath160 , where the non - unitarized probabilities are the largest .",
    "integrating the unitarized probability over the impact parameter for an estimate of the unitarization corrections in the diffractive cross - section , they are found to be smaller by a relative factor of @xmath165 .",
    "hence , they can be neglected here .      to close this section ,",
    "let us provide a table of the values of the cross - section per unit of rapidity , for charm and bottom quark pairs , and for inclusive for the electric charges of the quarks , which were not included in @xcite . ] and diffractive production :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     those numbers are obtained for a lorentz factor @xmath149 , a nuclear radius @xmath166fm and a saturation scale @xmath167 .",
    "in this paper , we have evaluated the cross - section for the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath16 pairs in peripheral collisions of heavy nuclei .",
    "diffractive events are particularly interesting because they could provide a cleaner final state due a rapidity gap between the nuclei and the pair",
    ". this process can be used as a way to test saturation models , and to measure the value of the saturation scale in heavy ion experiments .",
    "indeed , the yield of @xmath16 pairs has been found to be very sensitive to the value of the saturation scale , especially for @xmath168 and @xmath169 quarks and for values of the saturation scale between @xmath40 and @xmath164gev .",
    "we have also checked that our result is consistent with the one obtained in @xcite for the photoproduction of pairs in inclusive events . in particular ,",
    "the inequality @xmath170 is satisfied by our calculation , and the black - disc limit is recovered when the saturation scale becomes infinite .    * acknowledgments : * this work is supported by doe under grant de - ac02 - 98ch10886 .",
