    "leptogenesis@xcite is perhaps the most appealing mechanism to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe .",
    "one of its remarkable features is the possibility of establishing a bridge between neutrino physics at high and low energies , through the well - known seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation .",
    "several scenarios are conceivable in this context .",
    "namely , the canonical ones are the type i@xcite , type ii@xcite and type iii@xcite seesaws , in which neutrino masses are mediated by the three - level exchange of heavy singlet fermions , @xmath0-triplet scalars and @xmath0-triplet fermions , respectively . particularly economical",
    "is the type ii seesaw scenario with one triplet , where the flavour pattern of the yukawa couplings between the scalar triplets and the standard model ( sm ) doublets uniquely determines the flavour structure of the low - energy effective neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this feature is particularly interesting when the type ii seesaw is embedded in a beyond - the - sm framework , where those yukawa couplings trigger new sources of lepton flavour violation that may be relevant for processes like radiative charged - lepton decays@xcite .",
    "this is indeed what happens in the supersymmetric type ii seesaw where model - independent predictions can be made for the rates of lepton flavour violating decays in terms of the low - energy neutrino parameters@xcite .    to successfully implement leptogenesis in a minimal type ii seesaw framework ( without introducing heavy singlet fermions ) ,",
    "at least two scalar triplets are needed@xcite .",
    "the complex yukawa couplings of the higgs triplets to leptons , as well as their complex couplings to the standard model higgs doublet , provide the necessary sources of cp violation for leptogenesis .",
    "in particular , the cp asymmetry in the decay of the scalar triplet into two leptons arises from the interference of the corresponding tree - level and one - loop amplitudes . a nonvanishing lepton asymmetry",
    "is then generated via the out - of - equilibrium decays of the triplet scalars in the early universe , which is afterwards partially converted into a baryon asymmetry by nonperturbative sphaleron processes@xcite .",
    "departure from thermal equilibrium crucially depends on the expansion rate of the universe . since at very high temperatures ( @xmath1  gev )",
    "all charged lepton flavours are out of thermal equilibrium , their states are indistinguishable .",
    "interactions involving the @xmath2 and @xmath3 yukawa couplings enter in equilibrium at @xmath4  gev and @xmath5  gev , respectively .",
    "the corresponding lepton doublets are distinguishable mass eigenstates below these temperature scales and , therefore , their flavour effects should be properly taken into account in the leptogenesis dynamics .",
    "such effects turn out to be relevant in type i seesaw leptogenesis scenarios@xcite . in particular , in the flavoured regime the washout processes can be less significant than in the unflavoured one , and the low - energy leptonic phases affect directly the final asymmetry so that it is possible to have successful leptogenesis just from low - energy leptonic cp violation@xcite . also , the upper bound on each individual flavoured asymmetry is not suppressed when the absolute neutrino mass scale increases .    so far , flavour effects in type ii seesaw leptogenesis have been only partially addressed@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the importance of these effects on the leptonic cp asymmetries generated in minimal type ii seesaw scenarios where leptogenesis is implemented through the out - of - equilibrium decays of scalar triplets into two leptons .",
    "the required cp asymmetries in those decays are guaranteed by the interference of the tree - level and one - loop decay amplitudes , in the presence of complex couplings of the triplets with the sm higgs and the leptons .",
    "it turns out that there is a novel contribution to the flavoured leptogenesis asymmetries coming from the wave - function renormalization correction .",
    "we briefly discuss some cases in which this contribution may be dominant .",
    "in the type ii seesaw mechanism , neutrino masses are generated through the tree - level exchange of hypercharge @xmath6 scalar su(2)@xmath7 triplets . as already pointed out ,",
    "a single triplet is enough to explain the low - energy neutrino spectrum .",
    "however , in this case it is not possible to generate a leptonic cp asymmetry for leptogenesis , since all the interference terms vanish at one loop .",
    "thus , we need to add at least another triplet to allow for the generation of a non - zero cp asymmetry@xcite . here",
    ", we will consider an extension of the sm in which @xmath8 scalar triplets @xmath9 are added .",
    "following the usual su(2 ) representation , each @xmath9 can be written in terms of the corresponding charge eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath11 as     tree - level and one - loop feynman diagrams contributing to the cp asymmetry in a type ii seesaw framework.,width=453 ]    @xmath12    the relevant lagrangian is given by    @xmath13- \\left(\\mathbf{y}^{t_a}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\overline{\\ell_{l\\alpha}}t^\\dagger_a \\ell^{c}_{l\\beta}+\\text{h.c.}\\right)-v_{t}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 contains the sm terms and @xmath15 accounts for the scalar potential terms involving the triplets , @xmath16 in the above equations , @xmath17 stands for the usual covariant derivative , @xmath18 is the sm higgs doublet ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 is a sm lepton doublet .",

    "therefore , at tree level @xmath28 .",

    "the only diagrams contributing to the cp asymmetries are those coming from wave function renormalization , shown in figs .",

    "the class of scenarios where the total unflavoured lepton asymmetry is zero ( @xmath141 ) , while its individual flavour contributions are not , is known as purely flavoured leptogenesis ( pfl)@xcite .",
    "these scenarios have been studied in type - i seesaw leptogenesis , and it has been shown that , in order to get a sizable contribution from the boltzmann equations , the various flavour projections have to be different . in the case where these projections are of the same order for each flavour , known as lepton flavour equilibration , pfl may become ineffective@xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) is by imposing some symmetry that forbids the trilinear terms @xmath142 .",
    "clearly , in this case , no effective neutrino mass term can be generated . to implement the type ii seesaw mechanism the symmetry should be softly broken .",
    "a well - known example is the soft breaking of lepton number @xmath143 .",
    "for instance , considering a lagrangian invariant under @xmath144 with the symmetry transformations @xmath145 , only the lepton - number conserving loop diagram  ( c ) is allowed .",
    "neutrino masses can then be generated by an explicit soft breaking of the lepton number , or by the spontaneous breaking induced by the vacuum expectation values of additional scalar fields , @xmath146 .",
    "a drawback in the latter scenario is the appearance of pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons ( majorons ) after the spontaneous breaking of the global lepton number , which are tightly constrained by experimental searches .",
    "this problem can be avoided by replacing the continuous symmetry by a discrete one ; for example , by requiring the lagrangian to be invariant under the @xmath147 transformations @xmath148 .    to conclude , in this work we have studied the relevance of flavoured effects on the leptonic cp asymmetries generated in purely type ii seesaw scenarios , where leptogenesis is implemented through the out - of - equilibrium decays of scalar triplets .",

    "<S> a novel contribution to the leptonic cp asymmetries in type ii seesaw leptogenesis scenarios is obtained for the cases in which flavour effects are relevant for the dynamics of leptogenesis . in the so - called flavoured leptogenesis regime </S>",
    "<S> , the interference between the tree - level amplitude of the scalar triplet decaying into two leptons and the one - loop wave - function correction with leptons in the loop , leads to a new nonvanishing cp asymmetry contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the latter conserves total lepton number but violates lepton flavour </S>",
    "<S> . cases in which this novel contribution may be dominant in the generation of the baryon asymmetry are briefly discussed . </S>"
