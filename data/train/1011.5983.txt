    "a large number of empirical studies has shown that financial time series exhibit statistical features strongly departing from the gaussian behavior .",
    "this finding dates back to the work of mandelbrot @xcite , whose attention was mainly focused in recognizing realizations of stable processes , and to the analysis of fama  @xcite concerning the long tailed nature of the dow jones industrial average single components . since these fundamental contributions the modeling of financial returns has considerably grown , and very heterogeneous models , able to reproduce the degree of asymmetry and the excess of kurtosis of the measured distributions , have been proposed .",
    "a non exhaustive list includes approaches developing from specific distributional assumptions , as it is the case of the lvy flights  @xcite , the generalized student-@xmath0 or tsallis distributions  @xcite and the exponential one  @xcite .",
    "past empirical analysis have also proved the existence of non trivial scalings of higher order correlations between returns at different times , pointing toward the existence of a secondary stochastic process , as fundamental as that of the price , governing the volatility of returns .",
    "many effective mechanisms allowing to reproduce the observed correlation structures , where the stochastic nature of the volatility plays a central role , were proposed .",
    "discrete time models include arch - garch processes  @xcite , and multifractal models  @xcite , inspired by the cascades originally introduced by kolmogorov in the context of turbulent flows . as far as continuous time approaches are concerned , fractional brownian motion and stochastic volatility models have been extensively analyzed . for a review of the latter approach we suggest  @xcite and remind the reader to the discussion in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "focusing on the continuous time stochastic volatility framework , in this work we aim at reproducing many of the above mentioned facts which are generally accepted as universal evidences , shared among different markets in different times .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . after introducing a general class of stochastic models driving the evolution of the volatility , in section  [ sec : model ] we concentrate on a linear one able to reproduce an inverse gamma distribution in the long run . in section",
    "[ sec : fattails ] we detail the derivation of the moments of the probability density function @xmath1 of the returns over the time lag @xmath0 , taking into account explicitly the time at which the @xmath2 process has started and deriving rigorously the stationary limit of the volatility .",
    "we describe the mechanism through which the power law distribution of @xmath3 induces fat tails on @xmath1 for all the finite time lags . in sections  [ sec :",
    "lev ] and  [ sec : autoc ] we derive the analytical expressions of the leverage correlation and the volatility autocorrelation functions respectively . in section  [ sec :",
    "estimation ] we propose a systematic methodology for estimating the model parameters , and we apply it to the time series of the daily returns of the standard & poor 500 index . the relevant conclusions , along with possible perspectives , will be summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider a model where the asset price @xmath4 is a function of the stochastic centred log - return @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a constant drift coefficient .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 can be modeled with the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the instantaneous volatility of the price and @xmath9 is the increment of a standard wiener process . since @xmath10 , from the above assumption we have that @xmath11 and @xmath12 for all @xmath0 . in the context of stochastic volatility models ( svms )",
    "the instantaneous volatility is assumed to be a function of an underlying driving process @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "typically , the dynamics chosen for @xmath13 corresponds to a particular case of the following general multiplicative diffusion process @xmath15 with suitable constraints on the parameters , in order to ensure the well definiteness of the process .",
    "moreover , the two standard wiener processes @xmath16 are possibly correlated @xmath17 with @xmath18 $ ] , which is necessary to account for skewness effects and for the return - volatility correlation . for instance , in the stein - stein model  @xcite the volatility is linear , @xmath19 , and @xmath13 follows a mean reverting ornstein - uhlenbeck dynamics corresponding to @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 . under the same @xmath2 dynamics but with @xmath23",
    "we obtain the exponential ornstein - uhlenbeck model  @xcite . in the heston model",
    "@xcite @xmath24 and @xmath13 evolves according to a cox - ingersoll - ross dynamics , stemming from   by taking @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath25 .",
    "finally , in the hull - white model the volatility has the same functional dependence as in heston , but @xmath13 has a log - normal ( non mean reverting ) dynamics corresponding to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in the econophysics literature",
    "several studies have been devoted to asses the statistical properties of the volatility ( see for instance chapter 7 in  @xcite and  @xcite ) , especially its distribution , and it has been recognized that the instantaneous volatiliy , measured by suitable proxies , distributes in good agreement with a log - normal or an inverse gamma law , the best fit being obtained with the latter  @xcite which is able to better capture the heavy tail of the empirical distribution .",
    "none of the previously cited models feature an inverse gamma probability density function ( pdf ) for @xmath8 , even though this distribution has been considered previously in different contexts .",
    "for instance , the inverse gamma was introduced in the context of an arch - like evolution of the variance in  @xcite , and in the statistical modeling of financial data the marginalization of normally distributed returns conditionally on inverse gamma variance was widely exploited since it generates generalized student-@xmath0 distributions ( see  @xcite ) . however , as clarified by the empirical analysis performed in  @xcite , where intra - day returns are used to estimate a proxy for the daily volatility , an inverse gamma pdf for @xmath28 leads to an overweighting of the tail region .    here",
    "we afford the statistical characterization of the simplest linear svm able to account for this stylized fact about the volatility .",
    "the process   has been extensively studied and characterized in  @xcite where exact solutions for the moments of the associated pdf have been obtained allowing to study its relaxation modes toward a stationary distribution , if any . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath20 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , the process   has indeed an inverse gamma stationary distribution , whose support is @xmath31 as long as @xmath21 .",
    "thereby we consider the following svm @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 may be a fixed constant or randomly sampled , and the constant factor in the expression of the instantaneous volatility @xmath35 has been added for later convenience . as explained in  @xcite the stationary pdf of @xmath8 is @xmath36 where the shape parameter @xmath37 and the scale parameter @xmath38 are given by @xmath39",
    "a major point to be discussed before presenting a detailed derivation of our results is the different role played by the initial time conditions for the @xmath40 and @xmath2 processes .",
    "since @xmath5 represents the detrended logarithmic increment of the price over the time lag @xmath0 , it can be directly measured from real time series , and in a natural way we can assume as starting point for this process the spot time @xmath41 . on the other hand , the secondary process can not be observed directly but some of its statistical properties have been measured by means of suitable proxies . in particular , for intra - day frequencies there is no clear evidence of mean reversion , that is the high frequency volatility is very close to its asymptotic value  @xcite . in order to capture this evidence ,",
    "we assume that the process @xmath2 , driving the returns from @xmath42 to @xmath0 , started in the past at @xmath43 and we will perform the limit @xmath44 at the end .",
    "the assumption of stationarity for the @xmath8 process in   allows also to consider the returns @xmath45 as identically distributed and uncorrelated , even though not independent variables , by virtue of the _ i.i.d . _",

    "the previous equation is a linear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for every @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which can be solved recursively starting from the lowest order of @xmath53 and @xmath54  . ] , and whose solution involves integration of the moments @xmath55 of the @xmath2 process . for every @xmath56 and every time @xmath0 the latter can be expressed as a linear superposition of exponential functions @xmath57 } \\ , .",
