    "@xcite proposed an unorthodox explanation for luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs / s dor variables ) . in their scenario",
    "all lbvs have gained mass from companion stars , with various consequences .",
    "far more complex than the standard view , this idea was motivated by a statistical allegation that lbvs tend to be spatially `` isolated '' from young objects such as o - type stars . according to smith and tombleson",
    ", each pre - lbv star has an extended lifetime due to the mass that it has gained , and an extra velocity due to the `` kick '' ( i.e. , recoil ) when its companion becomes a supernova .",
    "these two effects are said to explain the alleged isolation .",
    "but we noted later @xcite that four facts together invalidate the isolation argument .",
    "*   smith and tombleson s sample of magellanic `` lbvs '' included a substantial fraction of stars that show no relation to the lbv / s dor phenomena , and others that are doubtful . moreover , they employed a statistical test that responds poorly to mixed samples .",
    "*   there are good reasons to separate bona fide lbvs into two classes with different evolutionary histories .",
    "this probable fact has been recognized for more than two decades , and separating the classes is not difficult . nevertheless , smith and tombleson mixed them indiscriminately in their statistical sample .",
    "they offered no justification . *",
    "it turns out that the luminous classical lbv s _ are _ statistically associated with the set of late o - type stars that smith and tombleson used in their test .",
    "this result is expected in the standard view but not in their model . *   in the traditional view , lower - luminosity lbvs should be too old to be associated with o - type stars ; and this prediction turns out to be correct .",
    "the two classes do indeed differ in the statistical tests , although smith and tombleson assumed that they are equivalent .",
    "these results support the standard view of lbvs , while smith and tombleson s `` kicked mass '' scenario fails the test that was cited as its motivation .",
    "we ( humphreys et al . ) examined only the spatial - distribution question , ignoring other concerns about physical processes .",
    "@xcite has recently objected , at great length , to these conclusions .",
    "the best of his counter - arguments depend on doubtful assumptions , while the others are false :    * text and results in @xcite are misquoted or misrepresented . * the hypothesis in question  smith and tombleson s scenario  is modified or supplemented with additional complications and assumptions . *",
    "test criteria are likewise altered .",
    "smith suggests that the standard view of lbvs  not the proposed new model  must pass new tests .",
    "the most important of these tests depend on some doubtful implicit assumptions . in effect",
    ", he attempts to transfer the burden of proof away from the smith and tombleson hypotheses .",
    "* some fairly well known observational facts are ignored without explanation . *",
    "smith continues to emphasize a particular type of formal statistical test , which , however , is known to perform poorly if a sample set contains some inappropriate members .",
    "since most of these flaws are evident if one consults @xcite , normally there should be no need for us to respond .",
    "unfortunately , though , smith s lengthy critique may discourage readers from checking the actual content in humphreys et al .",
    "that is why the following account is necessary . to assess smith s objections accurately , _",
    "one must carefully read the paper that he criticizes , _ with a considerable amount of background material in mind .",
    "below `` st15 '' refers to @xcite , `` hwdg '' is @xcite , and `` smith '' is @xcite .",
    "`` hd94 '' signifies @xcite , which remains essential for this discussion despite its age .",
    "( smith often cites his own much later papers for concepts that were explained in hd94 . )",
    "a parameter @xmath0 is the projected distance to the nearest o - type star ; it statistically correlates with stellar age . for other details , see st15 and hdwg and other references therein .",
    "in his  2 , smith identifies `` factual errors and misconceptions '' in hwdg , but each example is either demonstrably false , or trivial , or requires alterations of the st15 model . hence we must review his list . since full explanations",
    "would be extremely tedious here , see the original papers for details .",
    "the first two points are most crucial .",
    "\\(1 ) lbvs have higher @xmath1 ratios than other stars in the same parts of the hr diagram .",
    "smith is simply wrong in calling this fact `` an assertion that has no empirical verification '' and `` a conjecture from single - star evolutionary models , not observations , '' see @xcite .",
    "high @xmath1 makes sense in the standard view of lbvs , for reasons outlined by hd94 and @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) near the end of his  2 , smith asserts , as though it were well established , that `` statistically lbvs appear to receive an extra velocity spread ( or longer lifetimes ) beyond that given to the rest of massive stars . '' but _",
    "st15 failed to prove that assertion , _ see hwdg .",
    "then he demands formal tests `` rather than picking a few stars out of a sample . ''",
    "this view has two obvious faults .",
    "first , hwdg did not merely `` pick a few stars . ''",
    "they reviewed all 19 members of st15 s magellanic lbv sample and showed that seven of them definitely should not have been included , while five of the others are unconfirmed `` candidates . ''",
    "hwdg further reviewed the spatial locations of all known lbvs in m31 and m33 .",
    "secondly , the ks statistical test that he advocates is _ quite vulnerable to mixed samples and false sample members . _",
    "it produces erroneous results if either extreme of the distribution includes a separate class of objects .",
    "that is why it failed badly for st15 s sample in the magellanic clouds , see  4.2 of hwdg .",
    "\\(3 ) `` @xcite originally defined lbvs ... ''",
    "conti originated the acronym lbv but he did not define the class ; see @xcite ; and references therein .",
    "criteria to make lbvs a coherent species developed in the 1980s , e.g. @xcite .",
    "they led to the definition expressed in hd94 .",
    "\\(4 ) smith asserts that hwdg wrongfully omitted a star in the triple system hd 5980 from a list of classical lbvs .",
    "in fact , as clearly stated , that star s outburst did not match a normal lbv eruption .",
    "it should be considered a giant eruption candidate , possibly due to non - lbv causes .",
    "suppose we speculate , however , that the hd 5980 event was a real lbv eruption truncated by the presence of companion stars .",
    "then , instead of having the largest @xmath0 in a particular set as smith states , it would arguably have the smallest !  because one of its companions is an o - type star .",
    "that would strengthen hwdg s conclusions , not weaken them .",
    "even smith s choice of @xmath0 for hd 5980 is smaller than those of the lower - luminosity lbvs .",
    "one can debate the reasoning , but each additional counter - argument tends to reveal more unstated assumptions in the st15 analysis .",
    "\\(5 ) he next affirms at length that mwc 112 is different from sk  @xmath2 142a ; but hwdg do not say otherwise .",
    "\\(6 ) according to smith , `` another misconception expressed by hwdg '' concerns lbv velocities .",
    "first he criticizes hwdg s omission of a quantitative velocity discussion , though st15 offered none either .",
    "hwdg merely noted that confirmed lbvs show no sign of the enhanced velocities that one expects in the scenario that st15 originally described . in order to transfer a significant fraction of material",
    ", their assumed type of binary has to be close , with individual orbital speeds of the order of 200 km s@xmath3 . allowing for complications",
    ", one might reasonably expect runaway speeds well above 50 km s@xmath3 in at least a few cases  contrary to observations .",
    "but smith now explains how the velocities can always be less .",
    "after lengthy preliminaries , he suggests that the required supernova occurs after its star has been reduced to only about 4 @xmath4 , so the other ( future lbv ) star s orbital speed is only 20 km s@xmath3 or so .",
    "maybe ; but st15 did not say this , @xmath5 seems unusually small for a core - collapse supernova , and no clear reason is given .",
    "smith says `` a key point is that the relatively low velocity acts together with a longer lifetime ... to make the stars appear more isolated . ''",
    "but hwdg showed that the lower - luminosity lbvs probably have sufficient lifetimes anyway , while the classical lbvs are no more isolated than one would expect .",
    "\\(7 ) smith notes that the st15 model allows lbvs in binary or multiple systems , a possibility not clearly stated in their original paper .",
    "( their stated topic was the alleged `` isolation '' of lbvs . ) since most of his comments about binaries apply as well to the standard view of lbvs , they provide no support for st15 .",
    "\\(8 ) in his @xmath63 , he attempts to show that `` candidate lbvs '' should be included in the statistical sample .",
    "his test , however , is analogous to proving that grapes can be allowed in a sample of cherries because both classes have similar size distributions relative to oranges . by quoting p - values , dispersions , and other formal parameters",
    ", one can make this fruity conclusion seem plausible  unless we examine the objects . in the lbv case , a particular set of `` candidate '' stars with circumstellar ejecta have moderately advanced ages like some lbvs , hence smith deems them to be lbvs for statistical purposes .",
    "this is a more relaxed attitude than statisticians usually prefer .",
    "much worse , about 35% of st15 s sample members are almost certainly not lbvs ( see hwdg )  but smith still includes them in his figure 1 without explaining why .",
    "this is unacceptable statistical procedure .",
    "as mentioned above , the original st15 sample of `` lbvs '' included a mixed set of objects .",
    "hwdg explained why the mixture led to false results . but smith s  4 is titled `` cherry - picking the sample , '' with an implication that subdividing it would amount to fudging the statistics .",
    "we note , however , that this activity is traditionally called stellar classification , not cherry - picking .",
    "the stars physical differences are real .",
    "\\(1 ) smith protests the identification of classical lbvs in the magellanic clouds . referring to hwdg s set lbv1 of three classical lbvs",
    ", he says : `` one may question the validity of selecting the tail end of a distribution ... , '' and , in his next paragraph , a warning `` if one extracts the tail end ... ''",
    "he means that these stars have the smallest values of the distribution parameter @xmath0 . but this criticism makes no sense , because @xmath0 played no part in selecting the set ! see below . in the st15 scenario",
    "there was no reason why the three brightest lbvs should have the smallest @xmath0 s .",
    "but in the standard view it s obvious : classical lbvs are younger than the less - luminous lbvs .",
    "what he calls `` the tail end '' is a physically distinct set , recognized long ago without any reference to spatial distributions or @xmath0 .",
    "\\(2 ) he alleges an `` unquantified selection bias '' in set lbv1 . but _ those three stars were identified more than two decades ago as the classical lbvs in the magellanic clouds , _ see hd94 .",
    "no more have been found since . above . even with the larger @xmath0 value that smith prefers , adding this object to the sample would slightly strengthen hwdg s conclusions in a formalistic sense .",
    "but there is a substantial likelihood that it is not really an lbv . ]",
    "every member of the less - luminous set lbv2 is definitely below the luminosity criterion .",
    "hence the membership of set lbv1 is well established , and it is hard to see what smith means by `` selection bias '' for such a tiny set with no borderline members .",
    "\\(3 ) his next objection appears to arise from a fundamental misunderstanding of one important result .",
    "he asserts that hwdg `` found that [ set lbv1 has ] a similar distribution ... to late o - type dwarfs . ''",
    "he claims that this similarity reveals a contradiction in the standard model , because classical lbvs should not have the same distribution as o8o9 dwarfs which are much less massive .",
    "in fact , however , his argument is based entirely on the term `` similar distribution '' which hwdg did not use .",
    "the largest @xmath0 in set lbv1 is only 12 pc , but the alleged discrepancy refers to values larger than that ! according to st15 s figure 4 , the o8o9 distribution differs seriously from other o stars only for @xmath7 pc .",
    "the following details may be clearer if one views hwdg s figure 5 , which is copied here , see next page .",
    "first , a set of only three objects obviously can not be `` similar '' to a broad distribution in the sense that smith implies .",
    "hwdg s actual result was that _",
    "one can not prove that the three members of set lbv1 have a distribution different from the o - type stars .",
    "_ this was a much weaker conclusion , but it was important because it would not be true in the st15 model .",
    "hdwg did not dwell on the formal meaning of their term `` statistically indistinguishable , '' because it seemed obvious in the figure .",
    "no one viewing that plot would imagine that set lbv1 gives any information for @xmath7 pc .",
    "all three stars in lbv1 have @xmath0 s in the range 412 pc .",
    "these values fall near the distribution medians for subtypes o8o9 and also o6o7 ",
    "i.e. , for _ the entire range of o stars that can be 3 to 4 myr old .",
    "_ in the standard model , most classical lbvs should have roughly that age ( see item 5 below ) .",
    "\\(4 ) smith continues by saying that the lowest - mass rsg s should now be deleted from st15 s original rsg comparison sample ; evidently cherry - picking is sometimes good . in principle",
    "he is right about the sample , but he does not present a revised distribution . he _ conjectures _ that it would alter hwdg s results .",
    "the low - mass rsgs were under - represented in simbad anyway , so the original st15 comparison set may be more suitable than smith supposes .",
    "( a survey for lower - luminosity rsgs appeared after st15 : @xcite . )    instead of arguing about rsg comparison samples , we can simply review the four stars in hwdg s less - luminous set lbv2 .",
    "two of them , r71 and r110 , are located more than 200 pc from their nearest known o - type stars .",
    "does this fact imply greatly extended lifetimes ?",
    "probably not , since the expected ages can very likely account for large @xmath0 s without mass - gaining or other exotic effects .",
    "conventionally these two lbvs should be more than 5 myr old , making them older than almost all o - type stars ( see @xcite , @xcite , hwdg s figure 1 , and the 5-myr isochrone in fig .",
    "12 of @xcite ) . ,",
    "but they evolve beyond o - type in half that time .",
    "see , e.g. , the isochrones in fig .",
    "12 of @xcite . ]",
    "therefore , we can reasonably surmise that all the massive stars which formed along with r71 and r110 have had enough time to evolve beyond o9 . in that case",
    "there is no strong reason to expect nearby o stars .",
    "moreover , this assessment can be enhanced with rotation , extra mass loss , etc . , and",
    "in principle both of these lbvs might be extreme examples . in order to argue that some less - luminous lbvs @xmath0 values are too large for the standard model",
    ", one would need to concretely disprove ( not merely doubt ) this possible explanation and its variants .",
    "contrary assumptions and ks tests with altered rsg sets would not suffice .",
    "the chief point , again , is that hwdg s analysis established that low - luminosity lbvs are older than classical lbvs , irrespective of rsg comparison details .",
    "none of smith s objections contradicts this result .",
    "\\(5 ) next he asserts that the standard view requires classical lbvs to be associated with o2o5 stars , not merely o stars in general .",
    "this is a serious misrepresentation , because there is no strong reason to expect stars less than 1.5 myr old  about half of the o2o5 sample  to associate with lbvs .",
    "( see next paragraph below . ) in smith s figure 2 , the o2o5 distribution greatly differs from o6o9 because 40% of its members have separation parameters less than 3 pc .",
    "such small values indicate average ages less than 1 myr .",
    "the entire o2o5 sample includes stellar ages throughout the range 0 to 2.5 myr , while classical lbvs are thought to be roughly 3.5 myr old .",
    "may be less than 3 myr old , but no such lbv is currently known in the magellanic clouds .",
    "] many o6o9 stars have about the same ages as classical lbvs , but nearly all o2o5 stars are younger than lbvs .",
    "half of them are much younger .",
    "therefore smith s comparison of lbvs vs. o2o5 stars is unjustified .",
    "consider the star formation timescales .",
    "since stars with @xmath8 are seen in fairly compact groups ( @xcite and dozens of authors since ) , very likely they form in localized bursts . presumably these require special circumstances that are not needed for most stars below @xmath9 .",
    "( this is a long - known empirical statement , not theoretical . )",
    "suppose that each burst persists for about 1 myr , a reasonable possibility which can even explain the o2o5 distribution in smith s figure 2 .",
    "in that case , practically all of the new stars evolve beyond o5 before any of them reaches its lbv stage .",
    "more subtle considerations may also apply , because very - massive - star formation is so poorly understood .",
    "hence the situation is complicated but the main point is simple : smith s figure 2 relates more to star formation history than to lbv physics .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov  or preferably anderson - darling  test would be more appropriate for questions that are defined better .",
    "smith also mentions wnh stars , but in his figure 2 they appear more closely related to the early - o stars , than to lbvs . but",
    "there is no reason to suppose that quantitative ages can safely be deduced from that figure .",
    "smith s  5 concerns observed velocities , already mentioned in item 6 of  [ sec : misconcepts ] above .",
    "as noted there , st15 s scenario can be modified so that recoil speeds are too low to be identifiable . in his figure 3",
    "he recounts more ks tests , now referring to velocities in m31 and m33 .",
    "they require some unstated assumptions  e.g. , that the measurement errors are equal for lbvs and rsgs  and they produce no significant results apart from the obvious lack of high - speed runaways .",
    "he adjusts a model of recoil speeds to optimize its ks p - value , and notes that it differs from the zero - extra - velocity case ; but that is merely an indirect way of saying that there are statistical errors .",
    "( abbreviated explanation : the model parameter is non - negative , @xmath10 . if its true value is @xmath11 , the average best - fit value will probably not be zero , since that is the limit of the allowed range . ) no statistically significant result is explicitly claimed in smith s long discussion .",
    "if the st15 scenario is not required to have large recoil speeds (  [ sec : misconcepts ] above ) , then the observational data are obviously not precise enough to give an answer one way or the other .",
    "for the magellanic clouds , smith informally hints that a velocity range of `` 10 s of km s@xmath3 ... appears at first glance to be consistent with ... the mass gainer scenario in st15 . '' but this remark could be applied equally well to various other classes of objects .",
    "one misconception should be noted here to forestall it from propagating in the literature .",
    "smith says that r71 `` has a radial velocity that is offset by @xmath12 km s@xmath3 relative to the systemic velocity of the lmc . ''",
    "but that is irrelevant , because the star s velocity agrees well with the rotation curve _ at its particular location .",
    "_ hwdg carefully and correctly stated that the lmc lbv velocities are consistent `` with their position based on the h i rotation curve available at ned . ''",
    "this debate has some value as an illustration of traditional standards for scientific reasoning .",
    "it features two competing scenarios or sets of hypotheses :    *   the conventional view of lbvs has been familiar since about 1990 .",
    "it has not strictly been proven yet , but it is conceptually straightforward , it is consistent with existing data , it suggests a credible reason for the lbv high mass loss events , and no one has identified any major errors .",
    "the mass - loss events are said to be caused by one or more of the instabilities that arise when @xmath1 exceeds about half the the eddington limit ( hd94 , @xcite ) .",
    "the chief defects are that no one has yet identified exactly which instability dominates , and no one has yet calculated a realistic lbv outburst . *",
    "@xcite propose a different scenario motivated by statistical arguments .",
    "it is indisputably more complicated , it has multiple free parameters , and it employs a number of assumptions that the authors did not clearly acknowledge . despite the extra complexity , it does not account for some crucial facts that the standard model does explain .",
    "it offers no physical rationale for the lbv instability .    in these circumstances , according to normal standards the larger burden of proof rests on smith and tombleson .",
    "they appear to argue that their model is true because statistical tests disprove the standard view .",
    "this is illogical even if one discards the standard model , because other unorthodox models are also available .",
    "for example , we can extend the lifetime of an lbv progenitor simply by assuming that it has rapid rotation .",
    "@xcite showed that the standard view _",
    "does not _ fail the statistical tests that st15 proposed .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite repeatedly attempts to shift the burden of proof onto the long - standing conventional model (  [ sec : cherryp ] above ) .",
    "this case also highlights the dangers of uncritical formalism and sampling . as we noted several times above",
    ", the kolmogorov - smirnov test can produce false results if the sample set is a mixture of disparate classes .",
    "hwdg showed that st15 s set of magellanic `` lbvs '' contained at least three different types of stars  and so , as a result , the p - values in their table 2 are meaningless . the reasons can easily be understood by reading hwdg s  4.2 and then comparing hwdg figures 4 and 5 . again",
    "this case involves a fundamental principle : if there is a cogent objection to a member of a statistical sample , then it should be removed .",
    "@xcite in effect denies this , emphasizing statistical formalism instead of careful sampling .",
    "he repeatedly invokes the ks test with flawed samples ",
    "e.g. , st15 s original `` magellanic lbv '' and rsg lists , and the o2o5 stars in point 5 of  [ sec : cherryp ] above .      *   confirmed lbvs lie along a locus in the hr diagram , often called the lbv instability strip .",
    "*   they have abnormally high @xmath1 ratios .",
    "*   they occasionally produce high mass loss episodes with a particular set of characteristics .",
    "indeed these are the",
    "_ main requirements _ for a viable theory .",
    "the standard view accounts for them as described in hd94 and @xcite .",
    "smith and tombleson , however , did not give any reasons why the above facts should be true .",
    "their scenario is sufficiently flexible that we can adapt it to fit , adopting the same instabilities as the standard model .",
    "then the hypothesis becomes essentially this : a star gains mass from its companion , _ and then it evolves in the same way as the conventional view of lbvs . _ but why is the mass exchange necessary ?",
    "if lbv progenitors need extended lifetimes , rapid rotation is arguably a simpler alternative .",
    "anyway , as explained above and in hwdg , there is no clear reason to postulate extended lifetimes .",
    "we suspect that the mass - gainer hypothesis will eventually refer to `` maybe some lbvs '' instead of `` certainly all of them . ''",
    "the two lbv classes merit new work , because they have never been explored in much detail . strictly speaking",
    ", the two - classes concept rests on just two empirical statements : ( 1 ) stars with @xmath13 can not evolve all the way across the hr diagram but those below @xmath14 can ; and ( 2 ) the less - luminous lbvs have surprisingly small masses . these two items together imply that lower - luminosity lbvs are substantially older than the classical lbvs , see hwdg s figure 1 .",
    "perhaps all lbvs form a continuous mass - dependent set , and in every case the instability arises at the time when @xmath1 first exceeds some critical value . for the less luminous stars ,",
    "that time occurs quite late in the evolution . but these details have little effect on hwdg s clearly distinct sets lbv1 and lbv2 , which invalidated st15 s statistical assertions .",
    "there is nothing wrong with hoping that binary interactions play some interesting role for lbvs , but it is wrong to _ assume _ that they do . in order to replace the long - standing model with something very different",
    ", one needs to satisfy the classic hume - laplace - truzzi - sagan rule : extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof .",
