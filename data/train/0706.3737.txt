    "recent experiments @xcite have unravelled a fascinating set of phenomena in atomically thin layer of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms known as graphene .",
    "@xcite the quasiparticles of graphene are @xmath0-dimensional massless weyl fermions .",
    "@xcite in the context of condensed matter physics their properties are strikingly different from non - relativistic fermions .",
    "and phenomena that are hard to realize for the relativistic case , such as the klein paradox or the _ zitterbewegung _ are accessible in graphene .",
    "@xcite it is perhaps not an exaggeration to remark that many subtleties and a rich set of phenomenology are waiting to be discovered .",
    "a highlight has been the observation of an unconventional quantum hall effect @xcite and the corresponding theoretical development.@xcite in graphene the filling fractions are @xmath1 for magnetic field @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an integer.@xcite the factor of @xmath4 comes from the two fold spin degeneracy and the two fold nodal degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "the zeeman splitting is negligible compared to the cyclotron frequency and the disorder broadening of the landau levels .",
    "the factor of half is due to a zero mode in the landau level spectrum of dirac fermions.@xcite    for stronger magnetic fields , @xmath5 , plateaus appear at @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an integer.@xcite the plateaus at @xmath8 can be explained by the lifting of both the spin and the nodal degeneracies in the lowest landau level ( lll ) , but those at @xmath9 reflect only the removal of spin degeneracy in higher landau levels .",
    "the removal of nodal degeneracy requires electron - electron interaction .",
    "mechanisms suggested include @xmath10 ferromagnetism@xcite , sublattice symmetry breaking due to short range interactions@xcite and the generation of a mass gap by magnetic catalysis .",
    "@xcite @xmath10 quantum hall ferromagnetism predicts plateaus at all odd integer filling fractions .",
    "however , apart from @xmath11 , the plateaus at @xmath12 have not yet been observed .",
    "the special quantization rules in graphene are explained by the relativistic landau levels , modified perhaps by interactions , but for the existence of hall plateaus the laughlin argument is necessary.@xcite according to this argument the extended states at the center of a landau band are separated by the localized states elsewhere .",
    "if the fermi energy falls in the mobility gap , the plateaus are explained by a gauge invariance argument that is remarkably robust .",
    "the underlying phenomenon , therefore , is a localization - delocalization ( ld ) transition at the band center.@xcite the conventional integer quantum hall ( iqh ) plateau transition has been widely studied , and it is known that the localization length exponent @xmath13.@xcite can we prove that the same argument applies to graphene , and , if so , does the ld transition belong to the same universality class ?      in the absence of a magnetic field , dirac fermions in the presence of disorder have been widely studied in systems as varied as gapless semiconductors ,  @xcite gapless superconductors ,  @xcite and iqh plateau transitions .",
    "@xcite as compared to nonrelativistic fermions , the localization problem of dirac fermions is richer because of a number of discrete symmetries .",
    "more specifically , if the disorder is particle - hole symmetric , for example a random gauge field , the ld transition takes place at zero energy and is reflected in the single particle density of states ( dos ) , in contrast to the conventional metal - insulator transition where the dos is smooth through the ld transition .",
    "surprisingly , there is a line of fixed points with continuously varying exponents depending on the disorder coupling constant .",
    "@xcite some of the unusual behavior of disordered dirac fermions may be expected to realize in graphene .",
    "one such effect that has received considerable attention is the weak ( anti)-localization phenomenon.@xcite however , relativistic landau levels in the presence of disorder have not yet received much attention .",
    "@xcite here we provide a reasonably complete study of the possible effects .",
    "there is another important reason why ld transitions in the relativistic landau level should be carefully analyzed . in the conventional iqh effect",
    ", the spin - degenerate plateau transition corresponds to @xmath14 when it is assumed that the ld transition takes place at a single energy at the band center.@xcite this has led to intense theoretical investigation of the ld transition in the spin - degenerate landau band .",
    "@xcite when spin - orbit scattering is included , the ld transition is found to occur at two distinct energies , away from the band center .",
    "scaling analysis about these distinct energies provide , once again , that @xmath15 , as in the spin - polarized system .",
    "the scaling about a single energy at the band center leads to the effective exponent @xmath16 .",
    "one should anticipate a similar discrepancy between the spin and the nodal polarized iqh effect and the fourfold degenerate iqh effect in graphene .      for simplicity we shall concentrate on the spin polarized lowest landau level ( lll ) of graphene and analyze the ld transition both in the presence and in the absence of nodal degeneracy .",
    "an interesting example of a controlled analytic calculation in the disordered landau level problem is the dos in the lll .",
    "this was first computed exactly by wegner  @xcite by examining the euler trails of the impurity diagrams for the white noise disorder and was subsequently extended by brezin _",
    "_  @xcite by using a supersymmetric ( susy ) technique . here",
    "we also obtain some exact results for the dos in the disordered relativistic lll using susy techniques .",
    "the most general model of disorder consists of a random potential , a random mass , a random gauge field and a random internode scattering ; however , the random gauge field leaves the lll unperturbed .",
    "after projection to the spin - polarized lll , we study the following hamiltonian : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 represent potential and mass disorders respectively and @xmath20 and @xmath21 describe internode scattering effects .",

    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the dirac fermion model . in sec .",
    "iii we describe various possible disorders and their forms when projected to the lll . in sec",
    "iv we calculate the averaged density of states using supersymmetry .",
    "in the sections v , vi , and vii we describe the numerical studies of the ld transition projected to the lowest landau level .",
    "section viii is a brief concluding section . in the appendix [ appendixa ] we provide some mathematical details of the density of states calculation . in appendix [ appendixb ]",
    "we describe the recursive green function technique used for numerical calculations and finally in appendix [ appendixc ] we outline the procedure of data collapse involved in the finite size scaling of the localization length .",
    "the low energy quasiparticles in graphene are well described by the lorentz invariant form as the sum over two inequivalent nodes ( the fermi velocity @xmath71 ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 and the summation over spin @xmath74 is understood .",
    "the four component dirac spinor @xmath75 , where the component @xmath76 is constructed by superposing bloch functions close to one of the two inequivalent nodes @xmath77 of the brillouin zone , corresponding to one of the two sublattices @xmath78 of the hexagonal graphene lattice .",
    "the notation @xmath79 stands for the covariant derivative , @xmath80 being the vector potential .",
    "the @xmath81-matrices are defined by @xmath82 ; the pauli matrix @xmath83 operates on the two components corresponding to the sublattice indices , and the pauli matrix @xmath84 operates on the components corresponding to the nodal indices . to be explicit : @xmath85 to include a zeeman term , we add @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the zeeman energy and @xmath88 is a pauli matrix operating on the spin indices .",
    "the zeeman term breaks the @xmath89 symmetry of the spin space down to @xmath90 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator @xmath91 are well known : @xmath92 where @xmath93 refer to the particle and the hole branches . in the presence of disorder landau levels",
    "get broadened into a band , and the amount of broadening depends on the strength of the disorder .",
    "when the disorder is very strong , the half - width of the broadened band can be larger than @xmath94 , and experimentally this corresponds to the spin degeneracy of the landau bands . in the spin degenerate situation , the observed filling factors is given by @xmath95.@xcite    the lll wave function in the absence of the disorder in the symmetric gauge @xmath96 can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "the functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 are holomorphic functions of the complex coordinates @xmath101 ; @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the magnetic length .",
    "hence , in the zero mode , the first and the second node have nonzero amplitudes coming only from the sublattices a and b respectively .",
    "two distinct onsite energies on the two sublattices correspond to a charge density modulation at the lattice scale . as a result ,",
    "the particle and the hole branches acquire an energy gap .",
    "when linearized about the inequivalent nodes , this energy gap appears as a parity preserving mass of the dirac fermions . to be explicit , the linearized hamiltonian will have two new terms : the chemical potential term @xmath104\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{0}\\psi$ ] and the mass term @xmath105\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ ] , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the site energies at the sublattices @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "although the non - interacting quasiparticles are massless in the absence of site modulation , they can acquire a parity conserving mass due to interaction effects .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking is facilitated by the presence of the magnetic field , a phenomenon known as `` magnetic catalysis '' of chiral symmetry breaking.@xcite the effect has been argued to be the reason behind the quantum hall plateaus at @xmath110 observed in strong magnetic fields.@xcite though it is beyond the scope of the present paper to consider electronic interactions , we will pay some attention to the noninteracting problem with a finite mass .",
    "our philosophy is to analyze the consequences of having a mass ( possible in an interacting theory ) on the ld transition .",
    "so , we shall include the term @xmath111 in the effective hamiltonian to examine the effect of mass . in the presence of such a mass term",
    ", the nodal degeneracy of @xmath112 is removed and it splits into four levels @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "the introduction of the mass term does not , however , lift the nodal degeneracy of the higher landau levels , and the energy levels @xmath122 has the degeneracy @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , when a mass is included , quantized plateaus appear at @xmath124 , where @xmath7 is an integer .",
    "there are many sources of disorder in graphene : vacancies , interstitials , substrate disorder and lattice distortions due to dislocations . in principle there",
    "could also be random spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , due to the small atomic mass of carbon , spin - orbit coupling is very weak compared to other energy scales . for simplicity",
    ", we shall primarily be interested in the spin polarized limit and ignore the random spin - orbit coupling .",
    "point defects and substrate disorder can be described by introducing random site energies in the tight binding model . in the presence of substrate disorder there",
    "can also be a random modulation of the charge densities between the two sublattices .",
    "these effects can be described by a random chemical potential @xmath125 and a random mass @xmath126 in the continuum limit .",
    "because true long range crystalline order is not possible in two dimensions at any finite temperature , topological defects , dislocations and disclinations will be present .",
    "effects of these topological defects will result in random hopping amplitudes @xmath127 and hence intranode as well as internode scattering .",
    "however , these scattering processes will take place between states on different sublattices .",
    "the follwing two bilinears , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , describe the internode scattering terms arising from random hopping .",
