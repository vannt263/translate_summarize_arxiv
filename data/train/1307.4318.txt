    "most of the us national power grid has ultimately been shaped and built during the quick urbanization period of the beginning of 20@xmath0 century .",
    "increasing power demand continues to put enormous strain on the infrastructure of the aging grid , forcing utilities to maximally utilize its existing resources . as a consequence ,",
    "many parts of the grid often operate in nearly critical regimes with significantly increased probability of large scale failures @xcite . in the modern world",
    "it becomes crucially important to be able to read the state of the pre - critical smart grid in a timely and precise manner , to effectively control parameters of smart grids operating in pre - critical regimes minimizing the probability of their large scale failures .",
    "unfortunately , commonly used used power system state estimation and control algorithms , working extremely well for stable operating regimes , become less efficient ( see for example @xcite ) when the operating point of the grid is close to the threshold of instability .    as we shall discuss below",
    ", a partial reason for the decrease of efficiency of state estimation procedures is related to a strong amplification of fluctuations of the power system state vector closer to the threshold of instability .",
    "the present contribution addresses the problem of stochastic fluctuations of power system state vector close to voltage or phase - angle instabilities .",
    "the amplification of stochastic fluctuations of the system state vector in pre - critical operating regimes is also directly related to the phenomenon of critical slowing - down often observed in power grids on the brink of failure @xcite .",
    "naturally , detecting the onset of critical slowing - down by itself can provide an efficient way for early detection of approach to a large - scale instability @xcite .",
    "as will be explained below , the onset of critical slowing - down is naturally associated with a strong growth of fluctuations of the system state vector .",
    "this growth can in turn be locally identified well befiore the event of collapse from local synchrophasor measurements of voltage phase and magnitude on a given node of the smart grid .",
    "the contributions of our work can be summarized as follows .",
    "we provide a formal mathematical description of critical slowing - down phenomenon , and characterize it in terms of power flow jacobian as well as generator inertia and damping matrices .",
    "second , we derive a closed form equation for the autocorrelation and autostructure functions as well as power spectral density of state vector that completely characterizes the probabilities of arbitrary system trajectories . remarkably , the autocorrelation and autostructure functions are expressed in terms of steady - state power flow jacobian and its eigenvectors . finally , we validate all our results with numerical simulation of ieee 39 and ieee 57 test systems .",
    "to describe dynamics of system variables close to the threshold of instability , we use the structure - preserving model @xcite which reduces to the system of coupled swing equations on @xmath1 ( generator ) nodes of the power grid @xmath2 and power flow equations on @xmath3 ( consumer ) nodes of the grid @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 here @xmath8 is a voltage phase on a bus @xmath9 , @xmath10 is inertia constant of a generator on the node @xmath9 , parameters @xmath11 describe droop controls of generators and/or load dependence on frequency fluctuations @xmath12 on the @xmath3 nodes , @xmath13 is a voltage magnitude on a bus @xmath9 ( for the @xmath1 nodes , @xmath14 ) , parameters @xmath15 encode dependence of the power load on the voltage magnitude @xmath13 .",
    "finally , coefficients @xmath16 describe a ( weak ) dependence of the power load on the rate @xmath17 of the voltage change with time .",
    "the power losses are important for the dynamics of system state variables , thus generally @xmath18 .",
    "we consider the load model ( [ eq : p ] ) , ( [ eq : q ] ) with such parameters chosen that @xmath19 for simplicity , the choice of @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath20% change of the load per @xmath21% change in system frequency @xmath22 and @xmath23% change in power generation per @xmath21% change in @xmath22 @xcite , while parameters @xmath16  to @xmath24 change in power load per @xmath25 change in @xmath26 . for simplicity we assume , that all the loads have fixed power factors @xmath27 , and all fluctuate with time in the vicinity of the average ( base ) load @xmath28 , constantly deviating from the base value and returning back , so that @xmath29 @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the same applies to generated power , especially if the grid is exposed to intermittence of renewable energy sources .",
    "thus , @xmath31 generally behave as stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "the base load value @xmath32 itself changes with time but relatively slowly , with significant changes only noticeable at time scales of several hours . in principle , a given , aggregated load @xmath33 can be thought of as an aggregation of a huge number of power - consuming devices connected to the node @xmath9 of the grid , which get online and offline , connected and disconnected from the grid .",
    "a resulting overall time profile of the aggregated active load @xmath33 is represented on the fig .",
    "[ fig : load - time - profile ] .",
    "the characteristic time scale @xmath34 of step - like changes depicted there is @xmath35 sec .",
    "and the absolute value of its fourier transform .",
    "[ fig : load - time - profile ] ]    these relatively fast power load fluctuations on different nodes of the grid are statistically independent from each other , and their correlation properties of the vectors @xmath36 , @xmath37 can be considered gaussian @xcite .",
    "the latter have mean zero and are thus completely characterized by the expectation values @xmath38 while @xmath39 and @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a diagonal covariance matrix .",
    "note that generally @xmath42 alternatively , the fluctuations can be represented with the power spectral density @xmath43 , which is simply a fourier transform of the autocorrelation function ( [ eq : pcorr ] ) , see for example @xcite . here and in the forthcoming paragraphs the averaging corresponds to summation over possible realization of the load fluctuations . for stationary stochastic processes , the same results could be recovered by averaging over long time periods @xmath44 .    whenever the random load profile is composed of a continuing sequence of independent individual `` jumps '' , the power spectral density @xmath45 behaves like @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the characteristic time of power load correlations .",
    "we assume that this time is much longer than the typical timescales of @xmath48 that are considered in this work , but smaller than the scale of several hours . on the time",
    "scales correspoding to large enough frequencies , such that @xmath49 , one approximately has @xmath50 .",
    "the same approximation has been also proposed and justified in @xcite .",
    "importantly , this model is different from the ones considered in a number of other studies that rely on a more traditional `` white noise '' model @xcite .",
    "the latter implies that the correlation properties of the fluctuating power loads are described by @xmath51 , independent of @xmath22 .",
    "the power of such fluctuations of @xmath36 does not diminish with frequency , which is not realistic .",
    "close to the equilibrium operating point , the nonlinear system of equations ( [ eq : swing ] ) , ( [ eq : p ] ) , ( [ eq : q ] ) can be linearized : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the system state vector respreseting the deviations of voltage phases and magnitudes from the equilibrium value , @xmath54 is the power flow jacobian , the diagonal matrix @xmath55 encodes inertia of the turbines , while the diagonal matrix @xmath56 corresponds to the frequency damping",
    ". the system ( [ eq : swinglinearized ] ) of stochastic differential equations ( sde in what follows ) will be the main subject of our study .",
    "we discuss the general case of a power grid with a large number of @xmath1 nodes ( generators ) and @xmath3 nodes ( loads ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that the graph of the grid under consideration does not have any specific translational / rotational symmetries , in which case the saddle - node bifurcation , corresponding to the global collapse of the power system , has a co - dimension 1 .",
    "the autocorrelation function @xmath57 of the system state vector @xmath53 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and the system matrix is @xmath60 the value of the integral ( [ eq : corrfourier ] ) is determined by the singularities of the integrand in the complex plane of @xmath22 , which in particular include zeros of the determinants @xmath61 and @xmath62 as well as poles of @xmath63 at @xmath64 .",
    "when the autocorrelation function of the system state vector in the frequency domain is analyzed , the contribution of the the poles of @xmath63 can be filtered out by a high - pass filter . in time domain",
    "one can study the autostructure function @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 , where the large contribution of the pole of @xmath63 is cancelled out .",
    "naturally , among the remaining singularities , the one closest to the real @xmath22 axis undermines behavior of the autostructure function ( [ eq : corrfourier ] ) at large @xmath67 . to identify this singularity",
    ", we recall that near a co - dimension 1 saddle node bifurcation one ( and only one ) of the eigenvalues of the power flow jacobian @xmath54 vanishes @xcite .",
    "close to the bifurcation , the inverse of the power flow jacobian can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the eigenvalue of @xmath54 vanishing at the bifurcation , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the corresponding left and right eigenvectors .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the leading singularity of the integrand in ( [ eq : corrfourier ] ) coincides with a zero of @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 depending on the sign of the difference @xmath72 ) .",
    "such singularity is a simple pole by assumption that the center manifold of the power system is one - dimensional .",
    "constructing perturbation theory in powers of small @xmath69 and assuming the overdamped operating regime , one finds that the dominating mode determining behavior of the expectation value ( [ eq : corrfourier ] ) at @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 to the leading order in @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath75 contribution can be neglected as long as @xmath76 .",
    "note that the dependence of the leading mode on the matrix @xmath55 of inertia constants appears only in the second order in @xmath69 and is negligible in the vicinity of the bifurcation point , as @xmath77 .",
    "the frequency of the leading mode is purely imaginary to the order @xmath78 unless @xmath79 , i.e. , when the system is underdamped .",
    "estimating the integral ( [ eq : corrfourier ] ) near the leading singularity @xmath80 , one finally finds to the leading order in @xmath69 @xmath81 @xmath82 note that the matrix elements @xmath83 and @xmath84 are simple numerical factors , so that the dominating direction in the phase space of the system where the fluctuations of the system vector @xmath53 grow coincides with the direction of the right eigenvector @xmath71 corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue @xmath69 of the power flow jacobian @xmath54 , @xcite .",
    "according to the expression ( [ eq : corrffinal ] ) , as @xmath77 and the operating regime of the grid approaches the bifurcation , amplitude of the fluctuations of the system state vector @xmath53 grows as @xmath85 .",
    "depends on the load model , in particular , on the dependence of the expectation value of fluctuating loads on frequency @xmath22 ( @xmath86 in our case ) . ]",
    "simultaneously , the characteristic correlation time of these fluctuations @xmath87 grows as @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "these two effects explain the phenomenon of critical slowing - down often observed during large - scale failures of power grids @xcite .",
    "the growth of both the amplitude of fluctuations and the correlation time imply that close to collapse dynamics of the system vector @xmath53 can be represented as a sequence of relatively long time intervals with weakly changing values of system variables @xmath53 .",
    "however , these values significantly deviate from the equilibrium ones , @xmath90 , determined by the stationarity condition @xmath91 .",
    "this in turn ( at least partially ) explains why it is technically hard to correctly and rapidly identify the state of the power system close to an unstable regime using the standard power flow estimated procedures @xcite : away from the threshold of instability stochastic fluctuations of the system state vector @xmath53 are suppressed , while close to this threshold they are strongly amplified .",
    "the same applies to numerical errors of power flow estimators in operating regimes near bifurcation and prevents effective convergence of numerical schemes .",
    "it is very tempting to use the very signatures of critical slowing - down as markers of approach to stability loss @xcite . in this section",
    "we shall consider how the critical slowing - down affects behavior of the autocorrelation function in the frequency domain and then compare our conclusions to results of numerical simulations .",
    "the complete dominance of a single mode close to collapse implies that in the frequency domain expression ( [ eq : autocorrfrequency ] ) reduces to @xmath92 thus , at very small angular frequencies @xmath93 one finds a quadratic behavior of the fourier - transformed autocorrelation function ( [ eq : autocorrfrequency ] ) with @xmath94 : @xmath95 , while in the intermediate range of frequencies this behavior is quartic instead : @xmath96 .",
    "these two types of behavior are rather universal and can be seen even if the dynamics of the power system does not yet exhibit critical slowing - down .",
    "closer to the threshold of instability , as @xmath77 , the quadratic behavior of ( [ eq : autocorrfrequencysinglemode ] ) is realized in a smaller and smaller range of frequencies @xmath97 .",
    "this in turn leads to a stronger @xmath98 amplification of the amplitude of fluctuations at small @xmath22 : the matching point @xmath99 between @xmath100 and @xmath101 regimes is reached at smaller and smaller @xmath22 , while @xmath77",
    ". corresponding amplification of the amplitude of fluctuations of @xmath53 particularly noticeable at small frequencies is a very good marker of approach to stability loss .    in order to check these predictions ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the stochastic behavior of ieee 39 and ieee 57 test power systems close to the threshold of instability in both frequency and time domains .",
    "bifurcation points for both power systems discussed here were first localized using continuation power flow procedure @xcite implemented in psat toolbox for matlab @xcite and then identified more precisely using matpower library for matlab @xcite .    for the case of the ieee 39 test power system two chosen values of the continuation power flow parameter corresponded to the smallest eigenvalue of the power flow jacobian @xmath102 p.u .",
    "( operating regime relatively far from the threshold of instability ) and @xmath103 p.u .",
    "( pre - critical operating regime).the loads were allowed to fluctuate only on the buses 3 , 10 and 21 in order to check the difference in correlations of the state vector between the nodes with and without fluctuating power loads . on each of these nodes , a single realization of the active power load fluctuations was considered ( although realizations of @xmath104 of course differed between the nodes ) .",
    "other parameters of the model were chosen similarly to @xcite , which brings the system into an overdamped operating regime .",
    "for the case of the ieee 57 test power system the operational regimes chosen for simulations corresponded to @xmath105 p.u .",
    "( pre - critical regime ) and @xmath106 p.u .",
    "( normal stable operating regime ) .",
    "parameters @xmath11 were chosen as described in the section 2 .",
    "inertia constants @xmath10 of generators were chosen according to the relation @xmath107 , which , as explained in @xcite , effectively holds for many test power system models .",
    "as usual , the bus @xmath21 was the slack bus .",
    "the active power loads were allowed to fluctuate only on the nodes @xmath108 with characteristic amplitude of fluctuations @xmath109 p.u .",
    "the results of frequency domain simulations for the ieee 39 model are presented on the figs.[fig : ieee39-freq ] , [ fig : ieee39freq2 ] .",
    "the @xmath98 behavior along the relevant interval of frequencies is clearly seen for both cases of @xmath102 p.u . and @xmath110 p.u . , as well as an amplification of the fluctuations at small frequencies by more than an order of magnitude in the pre - critical operating regime .",
    "the prediction of the theory for the value of the auto - correlation function at @xmath111hz is @xmath112 for the case @xmath103 p.u . and @xmath113 for the case @xmath102 p.u . , in a good agreement with the results of simulation .",
    "as expected , we have found that the low - frequency behavior of different inter - node / single - node structure functions of the system state vector @xmath53 is rather similar irrespective whether the power load is fluctuating or fixed on the given node .",
    "this implies that a single - node autocorrelation function of the system state vector , in particular , its behavior at small @xmath22 , can be a good indicator of the approach to the loss of stability .",
    "the behavior at large frequencies differed noticeably , with inter - node correlations decaying more rapidly with @xmath22 for nodes with fixed power loads .",
    "the results of simulations of the ieee 57 test power system are essentially similar .    the results of simulations of the autostructure function @xmath114 in time domain demonstate its amplification at @xmath115 sec .    ,",
    "the load on both nodes @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the regime @xmath103 p.u .",
    "is close to the threshold of instability , while the regime with @xmath102 p.u .",
    "is relatively far from the threshold .",
    "amplification of the amplitude of fluctuations at small frequencies @xmath22 by more than an order of magnitude is clearly seen .",
    "the main plot uses the log - log scale .",
    "the inset represents behavior of the correlation function at small @xmath22 using the normal scale .",
    "[ fig : ieee39-freq ] ]     using the normal scale . the difference in amplitude of correlation functions at very small @xmath22",
    "is fully explained by the difference in magnitudes of the corresponding components of the vector @xmath71 .",
    "[ fig : ieee39freq2 ] ]    the singular value decomposition of the system state vector @xmath118 shows that there exists a dominating mode for the pre - critical regime @xmath105 p.u . , while this is not the case for the stable operating regime @xmath106 p.u .",
    ", where the contributions of many different modes to @xmath53 provide a contribution of the same order of magnitude into ( [ eq : corrfourier ] ) , see fig .",

    "@xmath119 smallest eigenvalues of the power flow jacobian for the same regimes .",
    "[ fig : eigsvd ] ]    finally , we would like to emphasize that the contribution of different nodes into the right eigenvector @xmath71 of the leading mode relatively weakly depends on the operating regime .",
    "thus , the dominant nodes of the grid contributing the most to this mode can be identified well before the threshold of instability is approached .",
    "in the present contribution we have studied the phenomenon of critical slowing - down often observed in power grids close to the threshold of a large - scale failure such as voltage collapse or a loss of synchrony @xcite . as we have argued ,",
    "this phenomenon is directly related to ( and can be explained by ) a strong amplification of fluctuations of the system state variables - voltage phases and magnitudes on individual nodes of the grid - for operating regimes close to collapse .",
    "we have explained how the phenomenon of critical slowing - down can be used to effectively detect approach to the threshold of instability .",
    "a technically simple method of detection is based on analysis of single - node ( or inter - node ) autostructure functions of the system state vector in the frequency domain , where approach to the threshold of instability is characterized by a strong amplification of low frequency part of the correlation function .",
    "it is very important to note that the onset of critical slowing - down can be detected using limited measurements of state variables , such as in the situation of incomplete observability of the smart grid , when effective and precise measurement of inter - area modes is impossible .",
