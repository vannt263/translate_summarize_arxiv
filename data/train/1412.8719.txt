    "the skyrme model is a nonlinear field theory model of atomic nuclei @xcite . as a classical field theory ,",
    "this model has soliton solutions , known as skyrmions , which are stabilised by a conserved topological charge .",
    "skyrmions have been calculated for various charges , see e.g. @xcite for a comprehensive summary , and @xcite for more recent results when it became apparent that massive pions play an important role .",
    "when these skyrmions are quantised , as fermions , they model protons and neutrons @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient in the quantisation are the so - called finkelstein - rubinstein constraints @xcite , which guarantee that skyrmions can be consistently quantised as fermions . using the symmetries of classical skyrmions",
    ", these constraints also allow the quantum numbers of the ground and excited states to be calculated @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite included massive pions and found that the energies of quantum ground and excited states of skyrmions had good qualitative and reasonable quantitive agreement with experimental results , for even topological charges .",
    "however , the approach does not produce good results for odd values of the topological charge greater than three .",
    "this may be related to the fact that skyrmions deform when they are spinning @xcite or isospinning @xcite .",
    "more recently , properties of carbon-12 have been successfully modelled using the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "these calculations helped to understand the structure of carbon-12 and the so - called hoyle state .    in nuclear physics ,",
    "scattering experiments are very important . however",
    ", relatively little progress has been made with skyrmion - skyrmion scattering , and its applications to nuclear physics .",
    "classical skyrmion scattering was first discussed using an axially - symmetric approximation in @xcite .",
    "the first numerical full field simulation of skyrmion scattering for two @xmath0 skyrmions was performed in @xcite .",
    "skrymion scattering for different charges with symmetric initial conditions was discussed in @xcite . the similarity with monopole scattering led to various important developments @xcite including the rational map ansatz @xcite . from a more analytical point of view",
    ", manton discussed low energy skyrmion scattering using the idea of an unstable manifold @xcite and the geodesic approximation @xcite .",
    "this unstable manifold can be mapped out exactly for well - separated skyrmions @xcite and has been calculated numerically in @xcite .",
    "schroers discussed the interaction of well - separated moving and spinning skyrmions in @xcite .",
    "braaten discussed in @xcite how to calculate scattering cross sections from the skyrme model .    in this paper , we focus on classical scattering of two charge one skyrmions with variable impact parameter . the paper is organised as follows . in section [ skyrmemodel ]",
    "we review the skyrme model with a particular emphasis on the dipol interaction . in section [ skyrmionscattering ]",
    "we present a numerical study of skyrmion scattering .",
    "we then describe skyrmion - skyrmion scattering in the attractive channel using the classical dipol approximation .",
    "we also derive the dynamics in the relativistic case and discuss the modifications for nonzero pion mass .",
    "we observe the interesting effect of `` rotation without rotating '' . in section [ visualisation ]",

    "we end with a conclusion and discuss open problems .",
    "the skyrme model is a three dimensional non - linear theory of pions where the field @xmath1 is an @xmath2-valued scalar .",
    "it is a low energy effective theory of qcd and is defined by the lagrangian @xcite , @xmath3[r^\\mu , r^\\nu ] ) - { m_\\pi}^2 \\mbox{tr } ( 1_2-u ) \\right\\}\\mbox{d}^3x,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 @xmath5 is the unit matrix in two dimensions and @xmath6 parametrizes the pion mass .",
    "here we have expressed the model in so - called skyrme units , where we have chosen an energy unit @xmath7 and a length unit @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the pion decay constant and @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "field configurations can only have finite energy provided that the field @xmath11 as @xmath12 hence , finite - energy fields are defined on the one - point compactification of @xmath13 , namely @xmath14 furthermore , the target space @xmath15 is homeomorphic to @xmath16 therefore , finite - energy configurations belong to an element of the third homotopy group @xmath17 and are indexed by an integer .",
    "this integer is the topological charge , @xmath18 , and is interpreted as the baryon number . in atomic nuclei",
    ", @xmath18 corresponds to the sum of the number protons and neutrons .",
    "the topological charge can be calculated as an integral over the baryon density @xmath19 namely , @xmath20 it is often more convenient to reparameterise the skyrme field with three pion fields @xmath21 and a constrained field @xmath22 as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the triplet of pauli matrices .",
    "we shall be making use of this later .",
    "numerical evidence suggests that the @xmath0 skyrmion is spherically symmetric .",
    "this is best described with the so - called hedgehog ansatz , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 for minimum - energy solutions the shape function @xmath29 has to be calculated numerically subject to the boundary conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31    for massless pions , @xmath32 the interaction of two well - separated @xmath0 skyrmions can be approximated by the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dipol strength , @xmath35 is the separation between the two skyrmions and @xmath36 for a @xmath0 skyrmion the constant @xmath34 is given by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath34 corresponds to the leading order term in the large @xmath39 expansion of the shape function @xmath40 .",
    "this can be shown by linearising the equations of motion for @xmath29 . in this paper",
    "we are only interested in when the interaction energy is minimal , namely when @xmath41 and @xmath42 we define this as the attractive channel , and the interaction energy simplifies to @xmath43    as a point of notation we define the skyrmionlocations as the points in @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "this is the antipodal point of the vacuum and is hence a region of large energy density .",
    "in this article we are investigating skyrmionscattering .",
    "there has been some analytical progress using the instanton ansatz @xcite , but so far the most productive method is to use numerical simulations .    to achieve this",
    "we first need an initial configuration to evolve .",
    "we create a suitable configuration by numerically solving the equations of motion for the hedgehog ansatz , for the value of @xmath6 which we are interested in .",
    "this gives us a shapefunction @xmath29 for the single skyrmion .",
    "we use this with the hedgehog ansatz and the product ansatz , @xmath46 to give a two - skyrmioninitial configuration . here",
    ", @xmath47 is the hedgehog solution @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the hedgehog solution @xmath50 , which has been rotated by @xmath51 about the @xmath52-axis in target space by the @xmath15 matrix @xmath53 this isorotation ensures that the skyrmionsare in the attractive channel . here , @xmath54 is the usual lorentz factor .    throughout this paper",
    "we consistently chose the hedgehog ansatz to be orientated such that under @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we then evolved this initial configuration using a finite difference leap - frog method on a discretised regular lattice .",
    "we chose a lattice spacing of @xmath57 with either @xmath58 lattice points or @xmath59 lattice points for large @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 and @xmath52 had the ranges @xmath62 or @xmath63 , depending on the number of lattice points .",
    "to minimise the effects of radiation , and to replicate the infinite plane , we damped the boundary of the box by smoothly introducing an extra @xmath64 term in the equations of motion at the boundary .",
    "this term damped the radiation and reduced the reflection off the boundary .",
    "we chose to use leap - frog as it is a symplectic integrator , and we argue that preserving momentum is very important during a scattering process .      in figures",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] we display snapshots of the scattering of two @xmath0 skyrmions . throughout the text we colour the skyrmionbaryon - densitylevel - set plots to show the angle the pion fields have from the @xmath65-axis on the @xmath66 plane .",
    "it is coloured such that when the field lies slightly above the @xmath65-axis the colour is orange and when it is slightly below the colour is red .",
    "there is a detailed discussion of this colouring scheme and its physical interpretation in @xcite . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "the top row shows skyrmion scattering for @xmath38 and zero impact parameter , @xmath67 , with initial speed @xmath68 the initial configuration is on the left . with the colouring scheme it is easy to see that the second skyrmion is rotated by @xmath51 around the @xmath52-axis .",
    "the skyrmions keep their orientation even as they merge and form the torus .",
    "however , when they reemerge as individual skyrmions after passing through the torus configuration their orientation has changed .",
    "this is a rather intriguing effect of changing orientation without actually rotating .",
    "we discuss this phenomenon further in section [ preimages ] .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the same set of snapshots but for @xmath69 in the initial configuration the skyrmions are more spherical , since the interaction force is weaker , leading to less deformation .",
    "the torus in the intermediate configuration is more compact with a smaller hole as expected for massive skyrmions , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .     and @xmath68 each row displays the initial , intermediate and final configuration . in the first row",

    "0.5        0.5        these images show how the pion mass , @xmath6 , affects the scattering process .",
    "for example it can be seen that for large separation the skyrmionwith @xmath72 is deflected less .",
    "as discussed earlier , for @xmath38 , the attractive channel has the interaction energy @xmath73 for simplicity , we firstly describe the non - relativistic dynamics .",
    "two @xmath0 skyrmions can be approximated as point particles of mass @xmath74 , which is the rest mass of a single @xmath0 skyrmion .",
    "we can then separate off the centre of mass motion , and the equations of motion can be written in terms of the relative coordinate @xmath35 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the reduced mass . note that in the attractive channel the force between the skyrmions is a central force , hence the relative angular momentum @xmath77 is conserved , and the dynamics takes place in a plane orthogonal to @xmath78 this two dimensional plane contains the non - trivial dynamics in the attractive channel and is known as the scattering plane . in the following we choose",
    "coordinates such that the scattering plane is given by @xmath79    we can generalise this approach in two ways .",
    "firstly , we can introduce the pion mass @xmath80 then the interaction energy can be written as @xmath81 in the attractive channel , @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath82 is now a function of the pion mass @xmath83 which is plotted in figure [ cm ] .",
    "this figure agrees with the results in @xcite .",
    "a point worth noting is that we find @xmath84 for @xmath38 as in @xcite .",
    "we also calculated @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath72 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "these are the values of @xmath6 which will be important later .     as a function of the pion mass @xmath88 [ cm],width=377 ]    as a second generalisation",
    "we also include relativistic corrections since we are interested in describing high velocities .",
    "the relativistic lagrangian for point particles interacting via a radial potential @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are position and velocity of the @xmath93th particle .",
    "can be treated as a function of separation only  ignoring retarded potentials . ]",
    "note that the relativistic momentum is given by @xmath94 the euler - lagrange equations then result in the usual force law @xmath95 in the following , we work in the center of momentum frame @xmath96 and we restrict our consideration to the nontrivial part of the attractive channel , namely , @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 then we can use the identity @xmath100 to show that if ( [ lag12eq ] ) is satisfied for @xmath101 it is also satisfied for @xmath102 the relativistic particle equations of motion become @xmath103 where , for simplicity , we have suppressed the superscripts and @xmath104 the relativistic particle equations of motion ( [ eomrel ] ) can now be solved for the dipol approximation @xmath105 in ( [ eint0a ] ) , or the interaction potential for massive pions @xmath106 in ( [ eintma ] ) . since we are interested in scattering processes our initial conditions are that the skyrmions are located at @xmath107 with initial velocities @xmath108 this gives the initial conditions for @xmath35 as @xmath109 and @xmath110 hence the relative angular momentum ( [ lrel ] ) is @xmath111 scattering is defined in the limit @xmath112 for finite @xmath113 not all velocities @xmath114 correspond to scattering solutions .",
    "for example for @xmath38 in the dipole approximation , starting with @xmath67 and @xmath115 at infinity ( @xmath116 ) gives rise to @xmath117 at @xmath118 by energy conservation .",
    "if @xmath114 is chosen lower than @xmath119 at @xmath118 then the trajectories can not escape to infinity .",

    "the skyrmions attract each other for small impact parameter @xmath60 and collide at the origin when the particle equation of motion is no longer well defined .",
    "once the impact parameter @xmath60 is larger than a critical value @xmath128 we observe scattering behaviour .",
    "the collision at the origin is an artefact of our approximation which does not include any short range repulsive force .",
    "therefore the trajectories are only physical for @xmath129 we plot both relativisitic and non - relativistic dynamics and can see that there is reasonable agreement for most trajectories .",
    "the error becomes particularly noticable for trajectories close to the critical impact parameter @xmath130     as a function of the initial velocity @xmath131 the solid red line corresponds to @xmath32 the dashed blue line to @xmath132 and the dashed - dotted green line to @xmath69[fig3],width=377 ]    figure [ fig3 ] shows the critical impact parameter @xmath128 as a function of @xmath114 for @xmath133 as can be expected @xmath128 decreases as @xmath114 increases , and @xmath128 tends to zero in the limit @xmath134 in figure [ fig4 ] we show how the scattering changes when the pion mass is increased to @xmath135 the scattering becomes less pronounced and @xmath128 is smaller than in the massless case .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] also shows the critical impact parameter @xmath128 as a function of @xmath114 for @xmath72 and @xmath136     the solid blue lines are the position of one skyrmion for impact parameters @xmath120 the dashed red line is the trajectory for the critical value of the impact parameter @xmath121 the dashed - dotted green lines are the non - relativistic approximation . in the left figure",

    "for example in figure [ trajs ] , it can be seen that , for large separation , the skyrmionwith @xmath72 is deflected less .",
    "figure[m0pt5-v0pt2-trajectories - one - side ] also shows the two distinct scattering processes .",
    "one scattering process is for small @xmath60 where the skyrmionscombine and then repel .",
    "this repulsion is a consequence of the geometry of the skyrmionmoduli space and is analogous to monopole scattering . only the scattering regime for large @xmath60 where the skyrmionsare deflected towards each other can be approximated by dipole scattering . in fact ,",
    "for @xmath38 in figure [ m0-v0pt2-trajectories - one - side ] all scattering trajectories have @xmath139 and , therefore , can not be described by the dipole approximation . for @xmath140",
    "the critical impact parameter is @xmath125 therefore , the outer three trajectories satisfy @xmath129 the outer two show a qualitatively similar behaviour to the trajectories in figure [ fig2]b while the third trajectories clearly experiences an additional repulsive force . for intermediate impact parameters , @xmath141",
    "the geometric effect and the dipole attraction compete .",
    "a point worth noting is that this competitive effect might effectively cancel for a scattering with impact parameter between @xmath142 and @xmath143 , for both @xmath38 and @xmath72 .",
    "this is the range of trajectories for which the @xmath144 value at @xmath145 swaps from being below the corresponding impact parameter to above it .",
    "this cancelation would not give a flat trajectory , but it would have the same @xmath146 values at @xmath147 as at @xmath148 .",
    "figure[m0-v0pt2-trajectories - one - side ] shows that the trajectories for @xmath149 and @xmath150 crossover for @xmath38 .",
    "it can be seen from figure[m0pt5-v0pt2-trajectories - one - side ] that does not happen for the same trajectories when @xmath72 .",
    "this is can be understood because both the geometric repulsive and dipole attraction effects are less for the increasingly localised @xmath72 skyrmion .",
    "for a long time skyrmions have been visualised as level sets of baryon density , and recently it has become standard practice to colour the level sets in order to show the value of the pion fields .",
    "this is a good method to visualise skyrmions , especially as it uses an invariant of the model .",
    "it clearly displays the symmetry of skyrmionsand shows how the skyrmionscan potentially be combined to make larger skyrmions .",
    "it is also a good method to visualise skyrmionscattering as shown in the previous images .",
    "but level sets of baryon density do not show how the skyrmionsrecombine during a scattering process .",
    "for example , as previously shown , when two skyrmionsare in the attractive channel and collide head - on then they scatter perpendicularly . from the simulations it seems as though half of each skyrmionis exchanged , and",
    "the corresponding two halves recombine to make two new skyrmionstravelling perpendicularly to the original velocities .",
    "our aim is to quantify this exchange and to visualise it in a new way which could shine light onto skyrmiondynamics .",
    "our construction is to track the preimages , @xmath151 , of a range of points @xmath152 throughout a collision .",
    "so far we have defined the location of skyrmionsas the points @xmath153 in @xmath44 .",
    "we shall now describe how we chose the preimages to track .",
    "our aim is to visualise a skyrmionscattering using preimages .",
    "our initial configuration and initial velocities are symmetric under the combined reflections @xmath154 where @xmath155 corresponds to the scattering plane .",
    "the reflection symmetry implies that @xmath156 in the scattering plane , namely @xmath157 hence we can define the equatorial two - sphere as @xmath158 .",
    "then , for a single @xmath0 hedgehog all of the points @xmath151 in @xmath44 for @xmath159 will lie on the scattering plane .",
    "this gives a two - dimensional way to visualise the three - dimensional skyrmionusing preimages which lie in the scattering plane , namely , we track the preimages of points in @xmath160 to visualise a scattering process .    as much as we would like to , numerically we can not track all of the preimages of @xmath160 .",
    "as we know , skyrmionsin this model are not discrete objects , but they are actually extended objects . when visualising a two - skyrmionsolution , with large separation , as a level set of baryon densitywe have to arbitrarily choose a value of baryon densitywhich shows two distinct skyrmions . as our aim is to use preimages to represent a two - skyrmionsystem , where we can identify single skyrmions , we choose a cut - off and do not sample points on @xmath160 where @xmath161 this is an arbitrary aesthetic choice .",
    "a cut - off is needed , so that we do not track points too near to the vacuum , @xmath162 .",
    "these points can move very rapidly due to radiation propagating around the system since perturbations about the vacuum have very little mass .",
    "therefore , tracking points near the vacuum would give an unrealistic representation of the collision .",
    "we chose to track the points , @xmath163 where @xmath93 and @xmath164 are integers , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "this range is appropriate because if @xmath167 then there would be @xmath168 points where @xmath169 hence this value of @xmath93 is excluded .",
    "the preimage of @xmath170 is also the location which we have already tracked .",
    "this defines @xmath171 points on @xmath160 .",
    "figure[single - palm ] shows , for a single @xmath0 skyrmion , the preimages of @xmath172 points given by , and compares it with the standard baryon - densitylevel - set image in figure[single - skyrmion - colored ] .",
    "note that for a two - skyrmionconfiguration there are @xmath173 points .    0.4 , and the preimage plot , [ single - palm ] , of a sinlge skyrmion.,title=\"fig : \" ]       0.4 , and the preimage plot , [ single - palm ] , of a sinlge skyrmion.,title=\"fig : \" ]       for each time slice we tracked the movement of each preimage using a search algorithm to find the point in @xmath44 which has the required field value and is the closest to the same point of the previous time step .",
    "we are only interested in tracking how the preimages in the initial configuration move",
    ". it should be noted that the algorithm interpolated the field values in between the lattice sites to increase accuracy .",
    "this gives us a new insight into scattering .",
    "we can now see how the preimages move during a scattering process .",
    "for example , for @xmath67 the preimages scatter perpendicularly giving figure[gap-0-palm ] .",
    "0.49     0.49     0.49     this new way of visualising skyrmionsimmediately shows that half of each skyrmionis used to form two new skyrmions , and the new recombined skyrmionsare now rotated .",
    "this is the cause of the rotationless rotation observed previously .",
    "this is implied by the baryon - densityplots , and it clearly shown in the preimage plots .",
    "what is not obvious from the baryon - densityplots is that this preimage exchange also occurs for large impact parameters .",
    "an example of two skyrmionsscattering with impact parameter @xmath150 is displayed in figure[gap-2-palm ] .",
    "figure[gap-2-palm - scattering0 ] shows the preimages of two skyrmions . in figure[gap-2-palm - scattering1 ] the two skyrmionsexchange four preimages as they pass each other .",
    "figure[gap-2-palm - scattering2 ] shows the preimages of the final scattered skyrmions .",
    "hence , skyrmionsdo exchange preimages .",
    "also , figure[gap-2-palm - scattering3 ] shows the initial preimages ( red circles ) and the final preimages ( green crosses ) of a single skyrmion . in figure[gap-2-palm - scattering3 ] we have also included the trajectory of a preimage .",
    "this shows that the skyrmionhas rotated even for a large impact parameter .",

    "this is shown in figure[points_ex ] . as the skyrmionspass each other they exchange preimages , and the number of exchanged preimages reduces with separation .",
    "this reduction in exchange is intuitive because skyrmionsare localized objects .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath174 ( dashed line).,width=377 ]    by carefully tracking these preimages we can measure the rotation angle of one skyrmionduring a scattering process . we achieved this by tracking the relative orientation between the location point and the set of preimages which are constant @xmath175   this is one ` arm ' of the preimage plot in figure[single - palm ] .",
    "care must be taken not to choose points which are exchanged . by tracking the relative average orientation between the location and the set of points of constant @xmath176 and not just one point ,",
    "reduces the effect of radiation .",
    "the rotation angle is shown as a function of time in figure[m0-rot ] .",
    "the oscillations in the rotation angle at large times are due to radiation propagating around the numerical lattice .",
    "figure[m0-rot ] shows that the skyrmionsmaximally rotate for @xmath67 when the rotation angle is approximately @xmath177 the rotation angle decreases as @xmath60 increases .",
    "this is can be understood because skyrmionsare localized objects .",
    "hence as @xmath60 increases they exchange less preimages as they overlap less , and therefore the skyrmionsexperience less rotation .",
    ".,width=377 ]    another way of gaining an understanding of this phenomenon is to consider the attractive channel approximation in @xcite .",
    "since the initial configurations are not spinning or isospinning , the total isospin ( @xmath178 in @xcite ) is zero .",
    "since the total isospin is conserved , this sets the rotation angular frequency @xmath179 equal to the isorotation angular frequency @xmath180 using the attractive lagrangian in @xcite .",
    "since both rotation and isorotation angles are zero , initially , they remain equal during the scattering process .",
    "if there was right - angle scattering , then the position of one skyrmion would be rotated by @xmath181 and the phase would also be rotated by @xmath182 as observed in figure[m0-rot ] . however , in this approximation , head - on collision does not lead to right angle scattering as the approximation breaks down for small separation .      instead of simply colliding skyrmions , we also investigated colliding spinning skyrmions .",
    "we achieved this by numerically evolving an initial condition of two rotating hedgehog skyrmionsboosted towards each other .",
    "we chose the skyrmionsto be orientated in the attractive channel , and rotate in the same direction and angular frequency .",
    "this is similar to a constant global isorotation , and the skyrmions remain in the attractive channel .",
    "this is similar to a constant global isorotation .",
    "it is known that for @xmath38 spinning skyrmionsare not stable as they radiate pions @xcite .",
    "this is not a problem when we considered @xmath38 as the scattering takes place well before the skyrmionsstop spinning .",
    "there has been some recent interest in spinning skyrmions , namely @xcite and @xcite , which investigate an extension of the collective coordinate quantisation procedure .",
    "the related question of isospin was examined in @xcite where the authors considered the deformation introduced by isospinning skyrmions .",

    "also , the skyrmionsno longer scatter perpendicularly .",
    "this is obvious by the trajectories of the location , shown in figure[trajectories - spinning ] .",
    "as the skyrmionsspin faster they deflect more .",
    "these spinning scattering results could help gain a better understanding of the spin - orbit coupling of nuclei @xcite .",
    "in the following , we compare skyrmion scattering in the attractive channel with monopole scattering . two - monopole scattering for low velocities can be calculated from geodesic motion in the atiyah - hitchin manifold @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "this four dimensional manifold can be parametrized by a radial coordinate @xmath184 and three angular coordinates @xmath185 @xmath186 and @xmath187 the radial coordinate is basically the separation of the two monopoles , and @xmath188 corresponds to the torus configuration .",
    "the angles @xmath189 and @xmath190 parametrize how the monopoles are positioned in @xmath13 whereas the angle @xmath191 gives the orientation of the monopoles along the axis of separation .",
    "the moduli space of monopoles has two important geodesic submanifolds , namely the `` trumpet '' which describes head on collision of monopoles with time - dependent @xmath191 , and the `` cone '' which describes monopole scattering in the plane ( with @xmath191 constant ) .",
    "we are interested whether there is an analogy of `` rotation without rotating '' in the monopole picture .",
    "skyrmion scattering without rotation in the plane corresponds to monopole scattering along the cone . as we have seen in section [ preimages ] the effect of `` rotation without rotating ''",
    "is related to how much the two skyrmions overlap . on the monopole",
    "moduli space there is a quantity which measures this overlap : the sen - form @xcite which is exponentially localised at the centre of the monopole moduli space , known as the bolt .",
    "the hyperkhler @xmath192 invariant metric on @xmath183 can be written as @xmath193 where @xmath194 are left - invariant one - forms and the coefficient functions satisfy the following differential equations @xmath195 where @xmath196 @xmath197 and @xmath198 here , we follow the conventions in @xcite and set @xmath199 then , the sen form is the unique normalisable anti - self dual harmonic two - form given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 the sen form is exact as we can write @xmath202 where @xmath203 note that @xmath204 at the bolt .",
    "now , consider a geodesic @xmath205 in the moduli space @xmath206 then the path integral @xmath207 is equivalent to the loop integral @xmath208 where we closed the loop via a circle segment at infinity .",
    "this does not contribute to the integral due to the asymptotics of @xmath209 namely , @xmath210 is exponentially localised . using stokes theorem , @xmath211 where @xmath113 is the surface bounded by @xmath212",
    "this can be interpreted as a holonomy on @xmath183 with respect to the sen form .",
    "this holonomy is conjectured to show a very similar behaviour to the `` rotation without rotating '' angle .",
    "in this paper we discuss skyrmion - skyrmion scattering for non - zero impact parameter . here",
    "we focus on the attractive channel where the two skyrmions are orientated in such a way that the attraction between them is maximal . for large separation",
    ", the scattering can be described in the dipol approximation which ignores the short - range repulsive interaction .",
    "we also discussed the necessary modifications needed to include non - zero pion mass and relativistic corrections .",
    "this approximation clearly breaks down at the critical value @xmath128 when the two dipoles no longer escape to infinity but collide with each other . for small velocities ,",
    "skyrmion scattering in the attractive channel is similar to monopole scattering which in turn can be described as geodesic motion on the atiyah - hitchin manifold .",
    "we have calculated skyrmion trajectories numerically for different velocities and impact parameters , and find good qualitative agreement with the dipol approximation for large impact parameters .",
    "when two non - rotating skyrmions scatter head on , namely with zero impact parameter , in the attractive channel then they scatter by 90 degrees . using our colouring scheme we observed the following .",
    "initially , the skyrmions have a relative phase of @xmath213 during scattering , the skyrmions move towards each other but do not rotate",
    ". then they form a torus and emerge again from the torus but in a different orientation .",
    "while both skrymions still have a relative phase of @xmath51 there overall phase has changed by @xmath177 what seemed to have happened is that half of the left skyrmion has gone up and half of the left skyrmion has gone down , and similar for the skyrmion coming from the right . hence the skyrmions have rearranged each other , and this leads to a `` rotation without rotating . ''",
    "this effect can be explored further by looking at preimages . in a skyrmion configurations of degree",
    "each point in target space generically has at least two preimages .",
    "when there are more than two preimages there has to be negative baryon density , see @xcite for further details . in our simulations , we did not find significants amounts of negative baryon density .",
    "since for large separations , two skyrmions are well approximated as hedgehog , we choose the position of the skyrmions to be @xmath215 during the scattering process we can generically track the preimages of any point on the sphere and calculate to which final state it belongs .",
    "this gives a way of quantifying rotation without rotating , also for non - zero impact parameter .",
    "by plotting preimages rather than baryon density we have created a novel way of visualizing skyrmions .",
    "we also briefly discussed the scattering of spinning skyrmions .",
    "spinning skyrmion solutions are not stable for massless pions due to pion radiation .",
    "however , we observed pion radiation before the skyrmions stopped spinning . spinning skyrmions no longer scatter at right angles during head - on collision .",
    "the configuration of closest approach is also no longer the torus but a configuration which is similar to the stationary solution of isorotation @xmath214 skyrmions found in @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the dynamics of spinning skyrmions with the attractive channel approximation in @xcite .",
    "there are still many open problems in classical skyrmion - skyrmion scattering .",
    "for example , how do skyrmions behave for more general initial conditions ?",
    "to what extend can the attractive channel be used to approximate more general scattering events ?",
    "scattering for higher charges is also an interesting topic .",
    "our preimage technique could provide novel insights into what happens to an individual skyrmion during scattering .    while we are currently studying classical scattering ,",
    "our long - term goal is to understand scattering of nucleons or even the scattering of nuclei .",
    "braaten has outlined how to calculate scattering cross sections in the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "we intend to combine this approach with our scattering results to model experimental results .",
