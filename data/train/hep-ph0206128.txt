    "our results are summarized in figures [ fig:1 ] - [ fig:12 ] , where the spikes in the distributions are because of the charm resonances as given in eqn.([sec2:eq:1a]).for @xmath87 , in figure([fig:1 ] ) we have plotted the variation of branching ratio with the scaled cm energy of the dileptons . as we can see from the graphs the deviation from the respective sm values is fairly large for almost the whole region of invariant dilepton mass .",
    "the deviation is more profound for sugra model then msugra model . in figure([fig:2 ] ) we have plotted the fb asymmetry for the transition . as has already been noted in earlier works @xcite that in sm the fb asymmetry vanishes .",
    "but if we consider susy then one can have a finite value of fb asymmetry .",
    "so any observation of fb asymmetry in this decay mode ( @xmath87 ) should be a clear signal of new physics . in figure([fig:3 ] ) we have given the estimates of the cp violating partial width asymmetry . as expected from the result of eqn([section3:eq:15 ] ) the new wilson coefficients does nt give any contributions to the numerator of the asymmetry but the denominator ( which essentially is the decay rate ) gets contributions from nhbs and hence the results that nhb effects actually lowers the sm estimates of the cp violating partial width asymmetry . the reduction is more for sugra model where all the scalar masses are not unified , in this case one can take higgs mass to be also a parameter .",
    "the new wilson coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 crucially depends on higgs mass and if higgs mass is low their value is high . in sugra model",
    "one can have relatively lower higgs mass and hence high value of new wilsons and hence high partial decay rate which effectively reduces the cp violating partial width asymmetry .",
    "but there exists another measure of cp violation which is the sum of the fb asymmetries of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is a sort of measurement which can be done in a environment having equal numbers of @xmath47 and @xmath60 pairs and as argued earlier @xcite does nt require any tagging .",
    "the important point over here is that fb asymmetry in this decay is zero in sm and hence the sum of the fb asymmetries of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "so the parameter @xmath68 ( which we have introduced in eqn([section3:eq:17 ] ) is zero .",
    "but if we consider susy then this parameter can have a finite value .",
    "in fact as we have shown in figure([fig:4 ] ) @xmath68 is more for sugra model then msugra model ( which is contrary to the partial width cp asymmetry ) .",
    "so this quantity could also turn out to be important probe for new physics . in figure([fig:5 ] ) we have plotted the normal polarization asymmetry of the final state lepton @xmath46 . as we can see from the expression of eqn([section3:eq:21 ] ) the value of @xmath77 is zero in sm .",
    "so the observation of non - zero @xmath77 could also be interpreted as signal of some new physics .",
    "is a t - odd observable which comes because of the non - hermiticity of the effective hamiltonian , associated with the real @xmath26 intermediate states , so it ca nt be taken as a measure of cp violation ] rest two polarization asymmetries the longitudinal ( @xmath76 ) and transverse ( @xmath78 ) vanishes with or without nhbs .    in figure([fig:6 ] ) we have plotted the branching ratio of @xmath90 with scaled invariant mass of dileptons . as we can see there is a fairly large deviation from the sm value . in figure([fig:7 ] ) we have plotted the variation of fb asymmetry with @xmath91 again one can observe the variation of msugra and sugra results from sm values .",
    "both the partial decay rate and fb asymmetry increase as compared to sm values in both msugra and sugra models . in figure([fig:8 ] ) we have plotted the cp violating partial width asymmetry . as we can see that here the predictions of msugra and sugra model gets decreased as compared to the sm value .",
    "the reason is the same as explained for @xmath87 transition . but",
    "again here if we look at the cp violation through fb asymmetry ( figure([fig:9 ] ) and we have the same effect as there in @xmath87 the sugra models increases values of as compared to sm values .",
    "although here the sm values of fb asymmetry as well as @xmath68 is not zero but still sugra models gives a enhancement of more than a order ( about a factor of 10 ) for almost whole region of the invariant dileptonic mass . in figures([fig:10]),([fig:11]),([fig:12",
    "] ) we have plotted the longitudinal ( @xmath76 ) , normal ( @xmath77 ) and transverse ( @xmath78 ) polarization respectively respectively .",
    "all the three shows variation from sm values but the general tend is that all these polarization asymmetries tends to decrease in sugra models as compared to sm values for almost whole region of invariant mass .",
    "for all the plots we have taken the variation of all the kinematical variables with the dileptonic invariant mass because the variation with respect to ( wrt ) invariant mass has more information than the result which we get after integrating over the invariant mass and also the variation of kinematical variables wrt invariant mass are in principle accessible experimentally . in future b - factories ( like tevatron and lhcb ) more than @xmath92 , @xmath93 pairs are expected to be produced @xcite ; this is many orders more than the projected yeild at the @xmath94 b factories , so these processes can be observed and some of the measurable quantities in these processes can be estimated .",
    "these processes ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are useful because they are relatively clean ( both theoretically and experimentally ) .",
    "also if there is no new source of cp violation ( except ckm phase ) then dileptonic decays @xmath2 and @xmath3 should be the first one where cp violation would be observed . as we can see from the tables [ table:1 ] , [ table:2 ] that the kinematical variables of @xmath95 looks to be more promising because of their magnitude .",
    "but in @xmath87 there are some distributions like fb - asymmetry , @xmath68 and @xmath77 which vanishes in sm but gives finite ( although small ) values with susy .",
