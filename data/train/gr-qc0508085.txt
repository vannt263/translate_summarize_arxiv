    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is a canonical quantization of general relativity , which relies on a 3 + 1 decomposition of space - time ( for reviews , check @xcite ) .",
    "it describes the states of 3d geometry and their evolution in time ( through the implementation of a hamiltonian constraint ) .",
    "the states of the canonical hypersurface are the well - known _ spin networks _ , which represent polymeric excitations of the gravitational field .",
    "the main and first achievement of the lqg framework is the implementation of quantum area operators and the derivation of their discrete spectrum .",
    "a surface is now made of elementary patches of finite quantized area .",
    "based on this discrete structure of the 3d space , one can study in details the entropy associated to a surface and the entanglement between the patches making the surface .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study analytically the relation between entropy and entanglement of the horizon state and discuss their physical / geometrical interpretations .",
    "let us discuss more precisely the concepts that were mentioned above .",
    "_ entanglement _ can be loosely defined as an exhibition of stronger - than - classical correlations between the subsystems . for a long time",
    ", it stood up among the apparent  paradoxes \" of quantum mechanics for its nonlocal connotations @xcite .",
    "recently it became one of the main resources of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "we discuss its relevant properties in sec .",
    "iib . in our work",
    "we are not concerned with its role in quantum information processing .",
    "instead we are interested in its relations to the entropy of black holes and the role of entanglement as a pointer to their physical properties , similarly to the recent discussion of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "a spin network is a graph , a network of points with links representing the relations between points .",
    "each link or edge is labeled by a half - integer , which defines the area of a surface intersecting the link .",
    "more generally , a surface is defined through its intersections with the edges of the spin network described the underlying quantum 3d space : the surface can be thought as made from elementary patches , each corresponding to a single intersection with a link and whose area is given by the label of that link .",
    "these labels actually stand for @xmath2 representations i.e _ spins _ , and are conventionally noted @xmath3 . due to regularization ambiguities ,",
    "there is not a definitive consensus on the precise area associated to a given spin @xmath3 .",
    "the original and conventional prescription is of an elementary area @xmath4 , but other reasonable choices are @xmath5 or @xmath6 ( although one would like to keep @xmath7 in the end for both physical intuitive reasons and also mathematical consistency @xcite ) .",
    "now , points , or vertices , of a spin network represents chunks of volume .",
    "mathematically , they are attached a @xmath2 intertwiner - a @xmath2 invariant tensor between the representations attached to all the edges linked to the considered vertex .",
    "a generic surface on a spin network background is thus described as a set of patches , each punctured by a unique link of the spin network . a @xmath2 representation @xmath3 is attached to each patch .",
    "we denote its hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "intuitively , a ( quantum ) vector @xmath9 in the hilbert space corresponds to the geometrical normal vector to the surface defined by the elementary patch .",
    "now the spin network defines how the patches , and therefore the whole surface , is embedded in the surrounding 3d space and describes how the surface folds . for a closed surface",
    ", the region of the spin network which is inside the surface exactly defines an intertwiner , invariant under @xmath2 , between the patches of the surface .",
    "this intertwiner contains the rotation - invariant information on the way the patches organize themselves to form the surface e.g the angle between two patches .",
    "an important remark is that any spin @xmath3 representation @xmath10 can be decomposed as a symmetrized tensor product of @xmath11 spin- representations @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , one can interpret that a fundamental patch or elementary surface is a spin- representation .",
    "all higher spin patches can be constructed from such elementary patches .",
    "for example , considering two spin- patches , they can form a spin 0 representation or a spin 1 representation : in one case , the two patches are folded on one another and cancel each other , while in the later case they add coherently to form a bigger patch of spin 1 .",
    "considering an arbitrary surface , one can then look at it at the elementary ( fundamental ) level decomposing it into spin- patches , or one can look at it at a coarse - grained level decomposing the same surface into bigger patches of spin @xmath13 . from this point of view , the size of the patches used to study a surface is like the choice of a ruler of fixed size used by the observer to analyze the properties of the object . when studying the entropy and entanglement on a given surface",
    ", we will therefore consider it made of a certain number of patches @xmath14 at the elementary level ( and not allow the size of the patches to vary when performing entropy computations ) . then one can study the coarse - graining or renormalisation of these quantities when one observes the surface at a bigger scale , using bigger patches to characterize the surface .    in the present work , we would like to study some basic properties of _ black holes _ in the framework of loop quantum gravity .",
    "black holes are actually the main object studied in quantum gravity . indeed , on one hand , they are especially simple objects from the point of view of theoretical general relativity , and on the other hand we expect a consistent theory of quantum gravity to shed light on the origin of the entropy of a black hole and on the so - called  information - loss paradox \" @xcite . here",
    "we propose to analyze the basic features attached to the horizon of a black hole through a simple model inspired from loop quantum gravity .",
    "we deal with the simplest case of a schwarzschild ( non - rotating ) black hole at the kinematical level .",
    "actually , studying black holes at the dynamical level in quantum gravity should be very interesting , and should allow to understand the evaporation process at the level of space - time .",
    "we will later comment on the dynamics as induced by lqg , but this will not be the main point of our study ; instead we have decided to focus on the black hole kinematics . considering a static black hole",
    ", our main assumption is that the only information accessible to the observer outside the black hole can be seen on its ( event ) horizon . considering the horizon as a closed surface , lqg describes it as made of patches of quantized area and describes the interior of the black hole in terms of ( a superposition of ) spin networks whose boundary puncturing the horizon defines the patches of the horizon surface . from the point of the external observer ,",
    "it does not matter what is inside the black hole , but only the information which could be read off the horizon is relevant .",
    "more mathematically , the horizon surface is defined as a set of elementary patches to each of which is attached a given @xmath2 representation .",
    "let us label the patches with an index @xmath15 and note the corresponding spins @xmath16 .",
    "the space geometry within the horizon , i.e. the black hole , is fully described by a spin network , which can possibly have support on a complicated graph within the horizon . from the point of view of the horizon",
    ", the details of the spin network inside the black hole do not matter : what actually matters is which intertwiner between the @xmath2 representations on the horizon does the spin network induce .",
    "indeed the observer outside the black hole is only interested by the state of the patches on the boundary , which lives in the tensor product @xmath17 .",
    "the only constraint on the state is that it should be globally gauge invariant , i.e. @xmath2 invariant , such that the horizon state is exactly described by an intertwiner between the representations @xmath18 . from this point of view",
    ", horizon states are described by a spin network having support on a graph with a single vertex inside the horizon , i.e. a fully coarse - grained spin network .",
    "actually , we would like to stress that our analysis applies to generic closed surface states as soon as we decide to ignore the details of the geometry of the enclosed spatial region .",
    "the basic model for a quantum black hole that we propose to study is not new .",
    "we assume that the model describe the black hole horizon at the fundamental level .",
    "in other words , we assume that the observer describing the black hole have the maximal possible resolution and probes space(time ) with a ruler of minimal area i.e. corresponding to a spin 1/2 surface . the resulting model for the horizon is to consider it made of a number @xmath19 of spin 1/2 patches : a horizon state will live in the tensor product @xmath20 .",
    "more exactly , we want a @xmath2 invariant state , i.e. an intertwiner between these @xmath19 representations . at this point ,",
    "let us point out that a spin 1/2 system is usually called a _",
    "( in the language of quantum information @xcite ) , so that one can say that the horizon is made of @xmath19 qubits and that a horizon state is a singlet state for these @xmath19 qubits . finally , the area of the horizon surface will by definition be @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the area associated to an elementary spin @xmath14 patch .    in this model , we will present the calculation of the entropy of the black hole and recover the entropy law , in an asymptotic limit , with a first term proportional to the horizon area and a logarithmic correction with a factor @xmath23 . for these purpose ,",
    "we develop a method to compute the number of intertwiners as a random walk modified with a mirror at the origin .",
    "then the point that we would like to particularly stress is that the @xmath19 qubits on the horizon are correlated , and more precisely entangled : the horizon is _ not _ made of @xmath19 uncorrelated qubits and the @xmath23 factor is actually a reflection of the fact that these qubits are entangled .",
    "then one can renormalize , or equivalently coarse - grain , this fundamental model , now assuming that the observer probes the space(time ) with a spin @xmath24 elementary surface .",
    "a coarse - grained model of the black hole is then to consider horizon states to be given by intertwiners between @xmath19 representations of a fixed spin @xmath0 .",
    "one can repeat the entropy calculation and check how the entropy law gets renormalized . the first term proportional to the area should simply get scaled by the ratio of the area @xmath25 corresponding to a spin @xmath0 surface to the @xmath22 .",
    "then we will prove using the random walk analogy that the logarithmic correction factor is universally @xmath23 and does not get renormalized .",
    "our approach is different from the standard loop quantum gravity approach , which studies the classically induced boundary theory on the black hole horizon ( or generically any isolated horizon ) .",
    "it is shown that one gets a @xmath26 chern - simons theory @xcite , which one can quantize and count the quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , some ways of computing the black hole entropy in such a context also involve parallels with random walk calculations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one would ultimately like to start with the full quantum gravity theory , identify horizons within the quantum states of geometry and study the quantum induced boundary theory on the identified quantum horizon .",
    "however , searching for horizons in a spin network states requires either introducing a well - defined notion of observer at the quantum level and/or being able to extract the ( semi - classical ) metric from the quantum state of geometry .",
    "we do not tackle these issues in the present work .",
    "we decide to model the black hole as a region of the quantum space with a well - defined boundary ( the horizon ) such that the only information about the geometry of the internal region accessible to the external observer is information which can be measured on the boundary .",
    "our results can therefore be applied to any closed surface in loop quantum gravity .",
    "issues about actually identifying this closed surface as a horizon at the semi - classical level is left for future investigation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section will detail the fundamental spin- black hole model .",
    "we will compute the entropy of the black hole and entanglement between qubits on the horizon . this will lead us to relate the entanglement of a pair of qubits ( or more generally a small part of the horizon ) with the rest of the horizon with its probability to evaporate from the black hole .",
    "we remark that the evaporation process can not work on a single qubit so that minimally only pairs of spins @xmath14 can evaporate .",
    "also , introducing a time scale canonically associated to a black hole , like the ( minimal ) time of flight of a particle on a circular orbit around the black hole , we derive the rate of evaporation from the probability computed previously .",
    "section iii deals with the generalized spin @xmath0 models . using the random walk analogy",
    ", we derive the entropy law and show the universality of the 3/2 factor for the logarithmic correction .",
    "section iv tackles the issue of the renormalisation of surface areas in the framework of lqg .",
    "consider a surface defined microscopically on a spin network .",
    "the spin network describes how the surface is folded and embedded in space .",
    "a natural issue is what will be the coarse - grained area that an observer will assign macroscopically to that surface .",
    "we use the calculations of intertwiners to deduce the most probable area seen macroscopically assuming no knowledge of the underlying spin network .",
    "we then propose to refine this by defining a ( background independent ) state of a surface in ( loop ) quantum gravity through the probability amplitude assigned to intertwiners between the elementary patches making the surface .",
    "this information can be equally thought as data on the surrounding spin network or as data on how the surface geometry gets coarse - grained ( how its geometry looks at different scales ) .",
    "we describe the horizon of the black hole as a two - sphere punctured by the underlying spin network by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , edges labeled by spins @xmath29 .",
    "the number of punctures defines the area of the horizon : @xmath30 , where @xmath22 is the area corresponding to a spin-@xmath29 elementary patch .",
    "the geometry of the interior of the black hole is described by the potentially complex graph inside the two - sphere .",
    "however , this information is not available to an observer living outside the horizon .",
    "this external observer has only access to the information on the horizon , i.e. , to the horizon state .",
    "it is given by the intertwiner between the @xmath27 punctures on the horizon , which corresponds to completely coarse - graining the internal spin network into a single vertex .",
    "the state lives in @xmath31 and is @xmath2-gauge invariant .",
    "the tensor product of @xmath27 spins @xmath29 simply reads : ^2nv^1/2 = _ j=0^nv^j_n , j , [ schur1 ] where @xmath32 is the irreducible representation of the permutation group of @xmath27 elements corresponding to the partition @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "more details of the representation theory of the permutation group can be found in appendix  d. the dimensions @xmath34 count the degeneracy of each spin @xmath3 in the tensor product @xmath31 .",
    "the intertwiner space @xmath35 is defined as the @xmath2-invariant subspace of the tensor product i.e. the spin @xmath36 subspace .",
    "it is obviously isomorphic to @xmath37 .",
    "we note its dimension @xmath38 .",
    "let us remind that we are considering an even number of spins since there does not exist any intertwiner between an odd number of @xmath14-spins .",
    "it is known that the degeneracy factors are given in terms of the binomial coefficients : d_j^(n)=c_2n^n+j - c_2n^n+j+1=c_2n^n+j .",
    "in particular the dimension of the intertwiner space is n = c_2n^n .",
    "below we give a derivation of these formulas in terms of random walks , which will be straightforwardly generalizable to higher spin models when we replace the fundamental @xmath14-spin by an arbitrary @xmath0-spin . using the stirling formula : @xmath39 ] to compute the asymptotics of the catalan number @xmath40",
    ", we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the entropy of the quantum black hole : sn ~ ( 2n)2 -(n)- .",
    "[ statentr ] the first term is linear in @xmath19 and thus in the area , and is the usual term that one expects to appear in any black hole entropy calculation . the precise factor in front of the area @xmath41 actually depends on the unit used to define areas .",
    "the next term is the logarithmic correction in @xmath42 .",
    "it is independent of the unit used to measure areas and thus the @xmath23 factor should be universal ( invariant under coarse - graining ) .",
    "we will not discuss the other terms , which can be considered as negligible in the large area case .",
    "in the next section , we will show that we get the same factor in any @xmath0-spin black hole model .    under the assumption that the external observer has no knowledge of the internal geometry of the black hole ,",
    "the density matrix ascribed to the black hole horizon is the totally mixed state on the intertwiner space : = _ i=1^n|_i_i|,[rho ] where @xmath43 form an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the intertwiner space .",
    "it is obvious that the von neumann entropy of this state reproduces the ( micro - canonical ) entropy : @xmath44 .",
    "below we study the entanglement properties of this state and show how the logarithmic correction to the entropy formula reflects the correlations between the @xmath27 patches making the black hole horizon .",
    "let us end this introduction by discussing the generality of this @xmath14-spin model .",
    "thinking about rotating black holes , some might be tempted to only require invariance of the state under @xmath26 rotations around a particular axis -say @xmath45- and thus count all states with vanishing angular momentum @xmath46 instead of the stronger constraint of vanishing spin @xmath36 .",
    "then the dimension of the horizon state would be @xmath47 and we would have only a @xmath48 factor in front of the logarithmic correction .",
    "however the @xmath2 invariance which we require is the gauge invariance present in loop quantum gravity and has nothing to do the physical @xmath49 isometry group of the two - sphere .",
    "a more serious criticism would be that in loop quantum gravity one must allow spin network labeled by arbitrary spins and thus we should more generally allow punctures of arbitrary spin and not restricting them to @xmath14-spins in order to have the true picture of a quantum black hole .",
    "our counter - argument is that any spin @xmath50 can be decomposed into @xmath14-spins and thus allowing higher spin punctures would lead to an overcounting of the intertwiners and horizon states .",
    "more precisely , for example , an intertwiner between one 1-spin and @xmath51 @xmath14-spins automatically defines a unique intertwiner between @xmath52 @xmath14-spins ( through the unique intertwiner @xmath53 ) . from this perspective",
    ", one can consider the @xmath14-spin black hole model as the universal black hole description in loop quantum gravity .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more details in the later sec .",
    "[ renormalisation ] on area renormalisation in loop quantum gravity .",
    "let us nevertheless point out that the interested reader can find details on the structure of the intertwiner space when allowing arbitrary spins labeling the punctures in @xcite .",
    "another argument in favor of the @xmath14-spin black hole model is given in @xcite as a symmetry argument in the semi - classical limit .",
    "this is related to the fact that the intertwiner space provides a representation of the permutation group , which can be interpreted as the discrete diffeomorphisms of the black hole horizon as made as @xmath27 elementary patches .",
    "we will tackle this issue later in sec .",
    "iii.2 .      in this section ,",
    "we show how one can compute the degeneracies of the tensor product decomposition and thus the entropy as a random walk calculation . indeed , describing the decomposition of @xmath31 iteratively",
    ", the analogy with the random walk is clear .",
    "if we are at the @xmath50-spin representation @xmath54 , tensoring it with @xmath12 , we obtain the representations of spin @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "only if we are at the trivial representation @xmath57 , then @xmath58 is simply @xmath12 .",
    "this way , it appears that the degeneracy of the @xmath50-spin in the tensor product @xmath31 can be computed as the number of returns to the spot @xmath50 after @xmath27 iterations of the random walk with a mirror ( or a wall ) at the origin 0 .",
    "more precisely :    the degeneracy coefficients @xmath59 in the decomposition of the tensor product @xmath31 into the irreducible spin-@xmath3 representations equal the number of returns @xmath60 to the spot @xmath3 after @xmath27 iterations of the random walk of step @xmath14 with a mirror in @xmath36 and starting at the origin .",
    "moreover the random walk with a mirror is given in terms of the standard walk by the simple relation : _",
    "n(j)=_n(j)-_n(j+1 ) , where @xmath61 is the number of returns to the spot @xmath3 after @xmath27 iterations of the random walk .    to prove this result , it is more convenient to deal with integer steps instead of switching between half - integers and integers after each step",
    ". then we actually consider the tensor product as @xmath62 : at each step , we are tensoring with @xmath63 i.e. moving either one step up or one step down or staying at the same spot .",
    "then it is straightforward to check that @xmath64 satisfies the same iteration law as the number of returns @xmath65 of the standard walk without mirror at the origin .",
    "then as @xmath66 , we recover the previous formula @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , this shows the simple identity : _ j d^(n)_j=_n(0)=c_2n^n . having these exact formulas , it is straightforward to derive the asymptotics of @xmath68 and @xmath69 when @xmath19 grows large , and the result is @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to directly extract these asymptotics without computing the exact expression . indeed , working on the unit circle @xmath26 and using the orthogonality of the modes @xmath72 , one has : _",
    "n(j)=_-^+d e^-i(2j)(e^i+e^-i)^2n = 2 ^ 2n_-^+d e^-i(2j)()^2n . for @xmath36",
    ", we evaluate this integral in the asymptotic limit @xmath73 using the saddle point approximation .",
    "first , we write _",
    "n(0 ) = 2 ^ 2n_-^+d ( ) ^2n = 2 ^ 2n_-^+d e^2n ( ) . then the exponent @xmath74 is always negative and has a unique fixed point ( which is actually a maximum ) at @xmath75 with the second derivative @xmath76 .",
    "therefore we can approximate the integral by : _",
    "n(0 ) 2 ^ 2n_-^+d e^-n^2 ~_-^+dx e^-x^2 , and derive the right asymptotic behavior . following the same line of thought , starting from _",
    "n(j=0)=_n(0)-_n(1)= 2 ^ 2n_-^+d ( 1-e^-i2)()^2n , and using that this expression is real , we get : @xmath77 now we have an integral of the type @xmath78 .",
    "the exponent @xmath79 has only one fixed point at @xmath75 . then since @xmath80 vanishes at @xmath75 , the leading order in the asymptotics",
    "is given by the first non - vanishing derivative of @xmath81 : _",
    "n(0 ) 2 ^ 2n_-2^+2d ^2 e^-n^2 ~_-^+dx x^2 e^-x^2 .",
    "this shows the @xmath82 asymptotic behavior of the dimension of the intertwiner space and thus of the horizon state space .",
    "the same analysis will be generalized in the next section to any @xmath0-spin horizon model .",
    "the factor @xmath23 of the logarithmic correction to the area - entropy law will appear to be universal and , as shown above , has a simple explanation in terms of random walks .",
    "although the asymptotics in @xmath83 and @xmath84 have a natural interpretation from the random walk perspective , a simpler way to obtain integral formulas for the degeneracies is to use the orthogonality of the @xmath2 characters .",
    "indeed , we have : d^(n)_j = dg_j(g)(_12(g))^2n = _ 0^^2d _ j()(_12())^2n , where @xmath85 is the normalized haar measure on @xmath2 .",
    "the character @xmath86 is the trace of the group element @xmath87 in the @xmath3-spin representation and is a function of only the rotation angle @xmath88 : @xmath89      the black hole model we analyze allows to deal with entanglement in a finite - dimensional setting .",
    "in addition , we consider only a bipartite entanglement , i.e. , entanglement between two distinguishable parts of this system .",
    "this is the best understood part of the entanglement theory @xcite . in this section and in the appendices we present only the most essential elements of the analysis .",
    "the missing proofs and the generalizations to other families of states can be found in @xcite .",
    "pure state entanglement is easily identified .",
    "pure states that can not be written as a direct product of two states are entangled .",
    "for example , the singlet state of two qubits , |^-=(|+--|-+),[singlet ] is an entangled state .",
    "the definition is more involved for mixed states .",
    "it can be expressed as a part of the threefold hierarchy . at the lowest level",

    "i w_i^i_1^i_2 , _",
    "i w_i=1 , w_i>0 . which are mixtures ( convex combinations ) of the direct product states .",
    "finally , entangled states are those can not be represented as separable .",
    "they have their own hierarchy which does not concern us here .",
    "apart from two - qubit systems , no single universal criterion that allows to tell whether a mixed state is entangled or not is known .    for pure states there is a natural way to quantify entanglement .",
    "the degree of entanglement of a pure state @xmath91 is the von neumann entropy of either of its reduced density matrices , e(|    @xmath92 are the maximally mixed spin-@xmath93 states @xmath94 , so its degree of entanglement is @xmath95 bit . in general , a pure state whose degree of entanglement is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the dimension of the hilbert space of one of the subsystems , is called maximally entangled",
    ".    there are various measures of entanglement of mixed states that reflect different aspects of their preparation .",
