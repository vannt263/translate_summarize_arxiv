    "so far the origin of the heavy fermion quasiparticle formation observed in this compound for @xmath6k remains to be a controversial subject , however , effects of electronic correlations and the geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore lattice are supposed to be key aspects of the problem .",
    "the quasiparticle mass enhancement is expected when a metallic system is driven by strong electron correlations to a vicinity of a charge and/or spin phase transition at low @xmath3 . in that case , the charge / spin disordered ground state on the metallic side of the transition in the strongly correlated system liv@xmath1o@xmath2 is sustained because a long - range order with a particular ordering ( critical ) wave vector @xmath7 is prevented by the geometrical frustration",
    ". expressed differently , the system can not choose a unique wave vector of an ordered structure which minimizes the free energy . instead",
    ", it is frustrated between different structures with different critical wave vectors @xmath7 s and equally low free energy .",
    "for instance , low energy spin fluctuations are expected to be present in a very large region of momentum space which is the signature of frustrated itinerant magnetism .",
    "this is in contrast to non - frustrated systems where the fluctuations are confined to the immediate vicinity of a unique incipient ordering vector .",
    "this scenario for frustrated itinerant magnetism was recently investigated in detail for liv@xmath1o@xmath2 by present authors.@xcite .",
    "an analysis of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements@xcite and calculations of the dynamic spin susceptibility allowed us to suggest the location of the paramagnetic spinel liv@xmath1o@xmath2 close to a magnetic instability .",
    "this was achieved by developing the rpa theory of spin fluctuations based on _ ab - initio _ band structure calculations and an on - site coulomb interaction of 3@xmath0 electrons .",
    "close to the critical value of the interaction strength , low energy spin fluctuations develop throughout a large shell in momentum space . they may be mapped to an effective low energy paramagnon model which describe low - temperature ins results@xcite accurately . from the comparison at @xmath8 0 ,",

    "we will use the effective low energy paramagnon model for spin fluctuations whose parameters are completely fixed by the comparison with ins .",

    "the observed complicated phase transformation display properties different from those expected from a first - order phase transition or a conventional metal - insulator transition . we note that",
    "because of quarter - filling of the electronic @xmath13 bands in liv@xmath1o@xmath2 , electron correlations due to inter - site coulomb repulsion have to play an essential role in the observed transition.@xcite under such conditions , a microscopic mechanism for the heavy quasiparticle formation on the metallic side of the transition has to be clarified .",
    "however , in the present analysis which is concerned with resistivity under ambient pressure the effect of inter - site coulomb interaction and a slowing - down of charge fluctuations will not be included .",
    "it was realized some time ago that the calculation of low-@xmath3 transport properties in nearly afm metals is a rather subtle issue .",
    "@xcite in clean systems with a peculiar afm ordering vector @xmath14 the quasiparticle scattering by quantum - critical spin fluctuations is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the strongest scattering occurs near the `` hot spots '' of the fermi surface ( fs ) connected by @xmath14 and the main contribution to the electrical conductivity is due to quasiparticles from the `` cold region '' of the fs . in that case , if the system is at some distance from the afm quantum critical point , the low-@xmath3 scattering rates are proportional to @xmath15 and the fermi - behavior @xmath16 is realized .",

    "a general strategy in describing the physical resistivity @xmath4 as a solution of the variational equation ( [ a5 ] ) in most of the metallic systems , including those with complicated electronic band structure , is to truncate the expansion ( [ a6 ] ) by keeping in it only a few of fsh s . following the common practice",
