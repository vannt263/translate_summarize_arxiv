    "the josephson effect ( je ) is a fundamental quantum phenomenon which reflects the coherent occupation of two or a few single - particle states by a macroscopic number of bosons .",

    "we report on a new type of je which involves the macroscopic coherent occupation of floquet states in ac - driven becs .",
    "orbital josephson effect _ is properly neither external nor internal , since the connected floquet states occupy the same region of space with the same internal atom structure , their sole difference residing in their orbital state .",
    "the josephson effect requires interactions in order to display truly collective behavior associated with the macroscopic occupation of two states  @xcite . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "the resulting rabi dynamics is merely an amplification of the dynamics undergone by a single atom  @xcite .",
    "the role of interactions in ac - driven many - body systems is difficult to treat , and frequently simplifications are made such as the two - mode approximation  @xcite , mean field theory  @xcite , and its first  @xcite and second  @xcite order corrections , or the use of an effective description  @xcite in terms of a static many - body hamiltonian with renormalized parameters .",
    "this latter approach is valid when the driving frequency is the dominant energy scale .",

    "we develop a description of the coarse - grained dynamics of the quantum field operator in an ac - driven many - boson system , thus going beyond a mean - field treatment and its first corrections .",
    "we find that , in the case of resonantly connected floquet states , the long - time evolution can be described by conventional quantum dynamics , by which we mean one deriving from an effective interacting hamiltonian . if the driving provides the only external potential , we find that a repulsive interaction in real space translates into an attractive interaction in the truncated hilbert space of a discrete number of resonantly connected floquet states .",

    "in this appendix we present details on the calculation of the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath128 given in fig .  [",
    "fig : detuning and sections]b .",
    "the lyapunov exponent reflects how fast the distance between two neighboring trajectories grows over time .",
    "we quantify the distance between two hilbert space vectors via the euclidean norm : @xmath153 with @xmath154 .",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent for the trajectory @xmath155 is defined over the double limit @xmath156\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath155 and @xmath157 are both solutions of the gp equation .",
    "because of the hamiltonian structure of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , it is convenient to allow only perturbations that yield states with the same value of the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "note that in our effective description the hamiltonian reflects the system s quasi - energy instead of its energy .",
    "within 3gp , the system s dynamics is given by the @xmath102-tuple @xmath158 , reflecting the expansion coefficients of the condensate orbital with respect to the three modes @xmath78 . in order to extract the lyapunov exponent from the system s dynamics",
    ", we consider the time evolution of the two initial states @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the normalization factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath161 parameterizes the initial distance , @xmath162 , between the trajectories @xmath163 .",
    "the hamiltonian of both the states  @xmath164 has the same value , and for  @xmath165 , we recover the initial state considered by us .",
    "we denote their time - dependent separation by @xmath166 , and use this quantity to estimate the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the limit  @xmath167 in the definition  ( [ eqn : def : lyapunov exponent ] ) translates into the limit  @xmath168 .",
    "( vertical line ) , the time propagation is inverted to check the accuracy . in ( a ) ,",
    "a linear ( on a log - scale ) fit is included for both values of @xmath161 , given by the straight gray lines .",
    "the parameters are the same as in figs .",
    "[ fig : detuning and sections]c ( b ) and  [ fig : detuning and sections]e ( a).,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    figure  [ fig : divergence examples ] shows the time evolution of @xmath169 on a logarithmic scale for chaotic  ( a ) , and regular dynamics  ( b ) .",
    "two different values of @xmath161 are considered . for chaotic dynamics",
    "the distance between the two trajectories @xmath169 grows over several orders of magnitude , until it saturates at a value around unity .",
    "this saturation occurs because the distance @xmath170 is bounded from above by the value @xmath143 , since both states  @xmath164 are normalized to unity .",
    "the value of @xmath128 is estimated by fitting an exponential to the rising slope of @xmath170 before saturation is reached . for the case",
    "shown we obtain @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) for @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "the estimated values thus have a relative difference of about @xmath175 , which implies a high relative uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , the obtained value for @xmath128 is clearly positive , indicating chaotic dynamics .    in the regular regime @xmath169",
    "deviates by less than @xmath99 of its initial value during the depicted time range , for both values of @xmath161 .",
    "chaos can be precluded when the global maximum of @xmath170 can be decreased by choosing smaller values for @xmath161 .    in all cases ,",
    "the accuracy of the simulation was checked by propagating both the states  @xmath164 backward in time after @xmath176 .",
    "the simulation is reliable , when  @xmath170 comes back to its starting value after @xmath177 .",
    "this check is necessary to ensure that the observed separation of trajectories is not due merely to numerical errors .",
    "we additionally calculated the maximal lyapunov exponent by a different method described e.g. in ref .",
    "the results obtained by that approach confirm the results presented here , by identifying the same parameter regions as chaotic ( and regular ) and yielding values  @xmath128 of similar magnitude .",
