    "structure and evolution of stars born in metal - poor environments or when heavy elements were siginificantly deficient in the universe are considerably different than for stars born much later with higher heavy - element abundances .",

    "opacity decreases with metallicity because of lack of absorption by heavy elements .",
    "hence it makes luminosity of the star higher . to maintain energy equilibrium in this situation , the stars with low metallicity need to be compact compared with the metal - rich stars . as a result , the main - sequence of metal - poor stars on the hr diagram moves toward the bluer and higher luminosity side . with this , the convective envelope of stars with @xmath4 becomes thiner and limited to the very outer layer close to the surface ( * ? ? ?",

    "the decrease in metallicity also makes cno - cycle energy generation less efficient . in the population i case , the pp - chain is dominant for @xmath5 , while the cno - cycle is influential for the more massive stars .",
    "but as the metallicity and the cno abundance decreases , the cno - cycle becomes replaced by the pp - chain for more massive stars . in the population iii case , the nuclear energy source is only the pp - chain at the zams stage for stars with @xmath6 ( * ? ? ?",

    "such instability and the resultant material mixing was once proposed as a possible solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , and the detailed numerical calculations of linear stability analyses demonstrated that such instability is likely to occur in a certain early evolutionary stage of the sun and the solar - like stars @xcite .",
    "the presence of a convective envelope , which occupies the outer 2030% of the stellar radius , however , has made it hard to reach a definite conclusion on the vibrational stability because of uncertainty in treatment of the convective envelope .    however , the situation is different in metal - poor stars .",
    "as described above , with decreased metallicity , convective envelopes of the solar - like stars become thin enough that the uncertainty in treatment of convection does not significantly affect results of the vibrational stability analyses .",

    "energy generated by the pp - chain occupies more than 80% for @xmath24 with @xmath25 at the zams stage , while for @xmath26 with @xmath22 .",
    "we performed a linear fully nonadiabatic analysis for the above equilibrium models by using a henyey - type code developed in paper ii . by following @xcite , we linearized the equations of continuity , motion , energy conservation and radiative diffusion , and the poisson s equation , while any perturbation terms are expressed in terms of a combination of a spatial function and a time varying function .",
    "the latter is expressed by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the eigenfrequency .",
    "the former , the spatial part , is decomposed into a spherical harmonic function , which is a function of the colatitude and the azimuthal angle , and a radial function .",

    "we adopted the `` frozen - in convection '' approximation , that is , simply neglected convective flux perturbation .",
    "this approximation is acceptable to this study since outer convection zones of the chosen models are very thin and the result of the stability analysis may not depend significantly on treatment of convection .    for a stability analysis relevant to the @xmath0-mechanism , we should adopt temperature and density dependences of nuclear reactions through the perturabation , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are different from those for evolutionary time - scale .",
    "for example , as for the pp - i branch in the pp - chain , the tempearture dependence of energy generation all through the branch in equilibrium is governed by the slowest reaction , @xmath33h(@xmath33h,@xmath34)@xmath35h , and @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",

    "we evaluate such effective dependences of the pp - chain and the cn - cycle through the perturbation , separately , and then average them with their contribution to the total nuclear energy generation to get the net values .",

    "in such a situation , it is plausible that convective flux does not react to pulsation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . as the convective core shrinks with stellar evolution ,",

    "collisional reactions belonging to them have high temperature dependence comparable with that of the @xmath38he-@xmath38he reaction , and contribute to the g mode instability . in the later stage , however , the g mode becomes to have a p mode - like behaviour in the envelope .",
    "then , flux dissipation there exceeds the excitation by the @xmath0-mechanism , and the g mode becomes stable again .",
    "we found that the above instability appears for stars , for example , with @xmath52 in the @xmath25 case .",

    "the g modes have relatively substantial amplitude at the surface as shown in figure [ fig:5 ] , although a nonlinear analysis is necessary to obtain the absolute value of the amplitude .",
    "@xcite estimated the dipole g@xmath1-mode amplitude in the solar photosphere to be about 20 cm s@xmath66 by adopting the three mode coupling theory .",
    "in particular , @xcite considered the special cases of parametric resonance , in which a parent linearly unstable mode is coupled with two dauther linearly stable modes . the oscillation energy of the parent mode is converted into that of the two daughter modes at a rate proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the three modes .",
    "the most effective for low - degree low - order parent g modes appears to be a coupling with a pair of similar high - degree daughter g modes to a state in which the amplitudes of all the three modes are steady .    the value 20 cm s@xmath66 is too small that the g mode oscillations are detectable for stars other than the sun .",
    "on the other hand , spb stars and @xmath49 doradus stars exhibit g mode oscillations with much higher amplitude .",
    "@xcite suggested that such stars have only shallow convection zones , and therefore daughter g modes propagate much higher in the envelope and dissipate much more strongly , thus being limited themselves to much lower amplitudes and thereby being less able to extract energy from their parent .",
    "such a situation also might be valid for the g modes in the metal - poor low - mass main - sequence stars analyzed in this study , although the linear growth rate is much smaller than in the spb and @xmath49 doradus cases .",

    "recently , higher number of faint variables are found in large magellanic cloud through the ogle project @xcite .",

    "young metal - poor stars may exist and are expected to be candidates for the @xmath0-mechanism pulsators .",
    "we also state a possibility that growth of the amplitude due to the vibrational instability might induce material mixing and have a significant influence on the later evolution of the star , as was expected concerning the solar neutrino problem by @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the mixing occurred in the core , the surrounding cooler and hydrogen riched matter would be incorpolated into the core .",
    "this phenomenon might induce rejuvenation of the star and prolong the lifetime . to obtain a solution to this problem",
    ", we have to persue the nonlinear evolution .",
    "we performed a linear nonadiabatic stability analysis of metal - poor low - mass main - sequence stars .",

    "the mass range of this instability extends toward higher mass with decreasing metallicity .",
    "one of reasons for this is that for metal - poorer stars density contrast between the inner and outer regions is lower , and that the g mode amplitude is relatively larger in the nuclear burning core .",
    "another reason is that as the metallicity decreases the cno - cycle burning becomes replaced by the pp - chain burning , which is favorable for the @xmath0-mechanism instability . as a result of the instability , stellar pulsation or material mixing",
