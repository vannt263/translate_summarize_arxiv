    "the first efficient approach for computing volumes of the strata in the moduli spaces of abelian differentials was found by a.  eskin and a.  okounkov  @xcite about fifteen years ago . the algorithm was implemented by a.  eskin in a rather efficient computer code which already at this time allowed to compute volumes of all strata up to genus 10 , and volumes of some strata , like the principal one , up to genus 60 ( or more ) .    about the same time together with h.  masur we expressed the siegel ",
    "veech constant @xmath0 of any stratum of abelian differentials in terms of an explicit polynomial in volumes of the `` principal boundary '' strata devided by the volume of the the original stratum , see  @xcite .",
    "the sum of the lyapunov exponents of the hodge bundle over the teichmller geodesic flow can be expressed by a simple formula in terms of the siegel  veech constant @xmath0 ( this formula , is recently proved by m.  kontsevich and the authors in  @xcite ) .    direct computations of volumes of the strata in genera accessible at this time combined with numerical experiments with the lyapunov exponents providing an approximate value of @xmath0 inspired two conjectures on asymptotic behavior of volumes of the strata and of the corresponding siegel  veech constant @xmath0 ; these conjectures were stated at the end of 2003 .    during the last decade",
    "we have shared this conjecture with colleagues who were interested in it , but the fact that it was never published lead to some misinterpretations due to misundersting in conventions on normalization .",
    "now , when the formula@xcite for the sum of the lyapunov exponents is finally proved , the conjectures become much more important .",
    "besides , there are recent encouraging advances with these conjectures , so it is an occasion to state the conjectures and describe the state of the art .",
    "holomorphic @xmath1-forms on a given riemann surface @xmath2 of genus @xmath3 form a complex @xmath3-dimensional vector space , so the moduli space @xmath4 of pairs ( riemann surface @xmath2 , holomorphic @xmath1-form @xmath5 on @xmath2 ) is a total space of complex @xmath3-dimensional _ hodge bundle _ over the moduli space of complex curves @xmath6 . the moduli space @xmath4 is called _ the moduli space of abelian differentials_. a holomorphic @xmath1-form @xmath5 on a riemann surface of genus @xmath3 has @xmath7 zeroes counting multiplicities .",
    "for example , a holomorphic 1-form on a riemann surface of genus two might have either two simple zeroes or a single zero of order @xmath8 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath4 gets naturally stratified by the strata @xmath9 of pairs ( riemann surface @xmath2 , holomorphic @xmath1-form @xmath5 on @xmath2 with zeroes of orders @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 . for example , in genus two there are only two such strata , namely , the _ principal _ stratum @xmath12 and the stratum @xmath13 .    note that , in general , individual strata do not carry any bundle structure over @xmath6 .",
    "the dimension of the stratum is computed as @xmath14 in particular , the dimension of the minimal stratum @xmath15 is @xmath16 while the dimension of the moduli space of curves @xmath6 is @xmath17 .",
    "the strata are not necessarily connected : they might have up to three connected components .",
    "in genera greater than or equal to four the classifying invariants are the _ parity of the spin structure _ applicable to strata @xmath18 for which all entries @xmath19 are even , and _ hyperellipticity _",
    "applicable to two special strata , namely , to @xmath20 and to @xmath15 , see  @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath21 the points of the riemann surface @xmath2 , where the holomorphic 1-form has zeroes . the vector space @xmath22 provides canonical local _",
    "period coordinates _ in the stratum @xmath9 .",
    "the lattice @xmath23 defines a canonical volume element @xmath24 in the stratum .",
    "this volume element induces a natural volume element on the real hypersurface @xmath25 given by the equation @xmath26    the group @xmath27 acts naturally on every stratum : in period coordinates @xmath28 @xmath27 acts on the second term in the tensor product . the subgroup @xmath29 preserves the volume element @xmath30 . by the fundamental theorem of h.  masur  @xcite and w.  veech  @xcite",
    "the total volume @xmath31 of any stratum is finite , and the action of @xmath29 is ergodic on every connected component of the stratum with respect to the invariant measure @xmath30 .",
    "a holomorphic 1-form @xmath5 defines a flat metric on a riemann surface @xmath2 with conical singularities at the zeroes of @xmath5 .",
    "such flat metrics appear , for example , by unfolding rational billiard tables .",
    "it is very useful to apply the following technology in the study of behavior of geodesics on flat surfaces of this kind .",
    "consider the @xmath27-orbit of the point @xmath32 in the ambient stratum of abelian differentials and find the orbit closure @xmath33 .",
    "the geometry of the orbit closure provides you with important information on geometry and dynamics of the original flat surface .",
    "the theorem of h.  masur and of w.  veech tells that for almost all flat surfaces in each stratum , such orbit closure is the entire ambient connected component of the stratum .",
    "in particular , several important characteristics of individual flat surfaces ( such as siegel  veech constants discussed in section  [ s : siegel : veech ] ) are expressed in terms of the volumes of the connected components of the strata .    for a deeper presentation of these ideas",
    "we recommend a short and extremely accessible introductory article  @xcite and more detailed survey papers  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we use the normalization of volumes from  @xcite .",
    "in particular , all the zeroes are `` named '' . in notations of  @xcite the formula for the volume",

    "we could also consider the asymptotics with respect to the dimension of the stratum .",
    "since the complex dimensions of the strata in a given genus @xmath3 vary from @xmath16 to @xmath53 the corresponding asymptotics are , basically , equivalent .",
    "note that some strata of abelian differentials contain several connected components  @xcite .",
    "the conjecture on the asymptotics of the volumes is stated for the total volume of such strata .",
