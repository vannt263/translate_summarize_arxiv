    "in quantum computation , one and two - qubit logic gates play a crucial role , since they are allow us to perform arbitrary quantum logic operation @xcite . recently ,",
    "a practical realization of these gates is a challenge for many physical laboratories . among several propositions of constructing the systems performing the two - qubit gates , the most promising are these based on the mechanism of controlled switching on / off the exchange interaction between spin qubits .",
    "tuning the exchange interaction between electrons in coupled quantum subsystems can lead to the interchange of qubits and the performance of a designed quantum logic operation .",
    "a physical implementation of the controlled exchange interaction is itself a difficult task .",

    "the spin swapping can also be obtained when irradiating the electron system by the electromagnetic wave with the frequency adjusted to the zeeman splitting in the external magnetic field @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we study the process of swapping the electron spins , which results from the controlled switching of the exchange interaction between the electrons in coupled qds .",
    "the tuned exchange interaction should lead to the rotation of electron spin @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model proposed takes into account all the three space dimensions and the electron spins .",
    "we apply the adiabatic approximation in order to decouple the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom and perform the integration over the transverse spatial coordinates .",
    "this leads to the effectively one - dimensional two - electron problem @xcite , which can be solved by the numerical method with an arbitrary precision @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we explicitly take into account the spin states of electrons .",
    "for sake of completeness , we repeat below the major steps of the approach @xcite .",
    "we study the two electrons localized in the double qd nanostructure .",
    "we assume the cylindrical symmetry of the system with symmetry axis ( @xmath0 axis ) going through the geometrical centers of the qds .",
    "the potential confining the electrons in the @xmath1 plane is taken to be so sufficiently strong that the differences between the energy levels resulting from the @xmath1 space quantization are much larger than the energy of spin swapping .",
    "this potential is usually called the lateral confinement potential .",
    "we approximate the lateral potential by the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential and assume that both the electrons occupy the ground state in the @xmath1 motion .",
    "in other words , we assume that the lateral electron degrees of freedom are frozen .",
    "the above assumptions allow us to reduce the starting three - dimensional problem to the effectively one - dimensional problem @xcite with the electron - electron interaction being the following function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 coordinates of both the electrons : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the vacuum electric permittivity , @xmath6 is the static electric permittivity , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the electron effective conduction band mass , and @xmath9 is the excitation energy levels of the electron transverse motion .",

    "the energy is measured with respect to the conduction band bottom of the quantum well material . in the calculations , we take on the parameters , which correspond to nanostructure based on gaas : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the free electron rest mass , and the static electric permittivity @xmath16 .    in the two - electron system",
    ", we are dealing with four independent spin states ; therefore , the total wave function of the system can be represented by the following four - component vector : @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are the spin coordinates of the electrons , @xmath20 are the basis wave functions with the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 = @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which correspond to the @xmath0-spin component eigenvalues @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "basis wave functions @xmath27 do not possess a well defined symmetry .",
    "however , total wave function ( [ psivec ] ) has to be antisymmetric with respect to simultaneous exchange of the space and spin coordinates .",
    "this property imposes the following conditions on the basis wave functions :    [ psi_cond ] @xmath28    in representation ( [ psivec ] ) , the operators of the total spin are expressed by the following @xmath29 matrices : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the unit 2@xmath322 matrix and @xmath33 are the spin pauli matrices .",

    "however , we can distinguish the two quantum dots , determined by the corresponding potential wells .",
    "we shall call them the left ( l ) and right ( r ) quantum dot ( potential well ) .",
    "if both the qds are separated by the potential barrier , which prohibits a tunneling of electrons , then in the ground state of the system , each electron is localized in a single qd . owing to this , we can determine the spins of electrons in the left and right qd .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce the auxiliary wave function @xmath39 , which will be called the reference wave function .",
    "this wave function is a solution of the schringer equation , for the two distinguishable particles , which  with an exception of indistinguishability ",
    "possess all the properties of the electrons .",
    "for the distinguishable particles we do no perform a symmetrization of the two - particle wave function . instead the solutions found for @xmath39 correspond to the configurations , in which one electron ( described by coordinate @xmath2 ) is localized in the left qd and",

    "the process studied , the spin of each electron localized in the left or right qd is flipped .",
    "the spins are swapped as a result of the controlled switching of the exchange interaction between the electrons .",
    "we discuss two methods to control the exchange interaction . according to the first method ,",
    "the exchange interaction is switched on ( off ) by lowering ( rising ) the potential barrier .",
    "the second method is based on the changes of the depth of one of the potential wells , which leads to the flow of electrons and their localization in the same qd . in the qd - based nanodevices , both",
    "the methods can be implemented by changing the external voltages , which are the source of the electrostatic field forming the coupled qds @xcite , or by locating the qd system in the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "based on the analogy with rabi oscillations in a two - level quantum system , the process of switching on / off the exchange interaction that leads to the change of the initial spin orientation to the opposite one , will be called the @xmath49 pulse .",

    "namely , we can directly determine the temporal evolution of the second ( @xmath70 ) and third ( @xmath71 ) component of the total wave function ( [ psivec ] ) , whereas  due to the symmetry ",

    "4(a ) correspond to the @xmath49 pulses with duration time @xmath92 , where index @xmath21 numerates the extrema .",
    "if we increase process duration time @xmath64 , we simultaneously increase the time interval during which both the electrons are localized in the same region of space . as a consequence , for the sufficiently long time",

    "these processes will lead to the decreasing amplitude of @xmath65 for increasing time interval @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , in order to perform successful quantum logic operation the spin swapping process should last for possibly short time .",
    "however , there exists the lower limit on time interval @xmath64 , during which the barrier is changed .",
    "this limit results from the requirement of the adiabaticity of the process : the barrier has to be changed sufficiently slowly , i.e. , in an adiabatic manner , in order to leave the system in the ground state . if time interval @xmath64 is too short , the system can be excited to higher - energy excited states , which leads to the increase of its energy and the non - adiabaticity of the process .",
    "the non - adiabaticity of the spin interchange process can be also observed in the behaviour of @xmath94 [ fig .",
    "a closer look at the present computational results has led us to the observation that the first maximum is slightly lower than the other maxima .",
    "for the first maximum the exact spin expectation value reaches @xmath37 with accuracy 98.7% .",

    "the extrema , which correspond to the second @xmath49 pulse , reach @xmath96 with accuracy 99.4% .",

    "the present results show that several processes of incomplete spin swapping can occur before we achieve the full interchange of spins , which leads to an elongation of the spin exchange time .",
