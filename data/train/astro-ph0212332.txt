    "_ chandra _ satellite observations have revealed a wealth of x - ray structures in the cores of galaxy clusters , including x - ray plumes ( e.g. sanders & fabian 2002 ) , cavities ( e.g. mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ) , and `` cold fronts '' ( e.g.   markevitch et al .  2000 ;",
    "vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 ; mazzotta et al .",
    "cold fronts ( hereafter cf ) are sharp surface brightness discontinuities ( widths are typically smaller than the electron mean free path ) characterized by a jump in gas temperature , accompanied by a fall in x - ray surface brightness such that the gas pressure remains continuous across the front .",
    "thus , these structures differ from bow shocks ( e.g. markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ) and are often attributed to subsonic ( transonic ) motions of accreted substructures ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 )    the incidence of gaseous substructures at the centers of clusters suggests that cluster cores are very dynamic , even when there are no obvious signs of merging ( such as in cooling flow clusters with regular isophotes ) . in this _",
    "letter _ we show that this is the case for a496 .",
    "this cluster is a typical , bright , nearby ( z@xmath20.032 ) , apparently well - behaved cooling flow cluster . in a joint _ ginga _ and _ einstein _ analysis of a496 , white et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found evidence for a central metal abundance enhancement .",
    "this was corroborated by _",
    "( e.g. dupke & white 2000a ) , _ sax _",
    "( irwin & bregman 2001 ) and _ xmm _ ( tamura et al .  2001 ) with greater statistical significance .",
    "furthermore , dupke & white ( 2000a ) also discovered radial gradients in various abundance @xmath3 , indicating that the gas in the central 2 - 3@xmath4 has a higher proportion of sn ia ejecta ( @xmath070% ) than the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "spectral analysis of radially averaged annuli with _ xmm _ is roughly consistent with _ asca",
    "_ results ( tamura et al .",
    "the spatial resolution achieved by the instruments on - board _ xmm _ are very limited in establishing fine correlations between spatial substructures , such as cfs , and spectral parameters such as metal abundances and temperatures . however , this analysis is important since it provides clues about the nature of such structures .",
    "for example , if cfs are caused by the passage of a high velocity gas clump through the intracluster gas , the sharp surface discontinuity should be accompanied by chemical discontinuities as well , representing the enrichment history of the two different systems .",
    "this kind of analysis can be performed best with _",
    ", given its high angular resolution . in this",
    "we describe the discovery of cfs in a496 and search for chemical discontinuities across them .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the gas mass distribution will be published elsewhere .",
    "all distances shown are calculated assuming a h@xmath5 km  s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 . at the distance of this cluster @xmath8 0.95 kpc .",
    "a496 was observed by _ chandra _",
    "acis - s3 in july 2000 and october 2001 , for 20 and 10 ksec , respectively . in both cases",
    "the cluster was centered on the s3 chip .",
    "the first observation was largely contaminated by flares . and will not be analyzed here .",
    "we used ciao 2.2.1 with caldb 2.9 to screen the data .",
    "two short flare - like periods were extracted and the resulting exposure time is 8.7 ksec .",
    "a gain map correction was applied together with pha and pixel randomization .",
    "the acis particle background was cleaned as prescribed for vfaint mode .",
    "point sources were extracted and the background used in spectral fits was generated from blank - sky observations using the acis_bkgrnd_lookup script .",
    "here we show the results of spectral fits with xspec v11.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) using the mekal and vmekal thermal emission models .",
    "an isobaric cooling flow model cflow , was used for the spectral fittings of the inner regions , where the minimum cooling flow temperature ( @xmath9 ) was allowed to vary .",
    "metal abundances are measured relative to the solar photospheric values of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "galactic photoelectric absorption was incorporated using the wabs model ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "spectral channels were grouped ( @xmath1025 cnt / chan ) .",
    "energy ranges were restricted to 0.58.5 kev .",
    "errors are 1-@xmath11 unless stated otherwise .    in order to compensate for the recently detected degradation of acis low energy quantum efficiency ( qe ) , we used the most recent corrarf routine , which applies the absorption model acisabs ( chartas & getman ( 2002 ) ) to the effective area file generated by the ciao tool mkarf .",
    "the resulting spectral fits have significantly reduced column densities ( compared to the prior , artificially inflated values ) , but they have a mild dependence on the low energy cut - off used in the data .",
    "low - energy metal abundances are also affected by the low energy cut - off value .",
    "since we are looking for _ relative _ changes of spectral parameters through different directions inside the cluster , this problem does not affect our conclusions .",
    "however , the absolute values of some abundances and of the hydrogen column density should not be considered definitive since the low energy calibration is still evolving .",
    "figs .  1a and b show the x - ray image of a496 .",
    "one can clearly see the sharp edge in surface brightness ( sb ) towards the north .",
    "1a shows the directions towards _",
    "sb_sharp _ and _ sb_smooth _ used to extract sb profiles .",
    "we also extracted sb profiles for the perpendicular directions ( labeled _ sb_east _ and _ sb_west _ ) for comparison .",
    "1b shows the extraction regions used for spectral analysis , which are separated in semi - annuli with opening angles close to 180@xmath12 towards the _ sharp _ direction and towards the opposite direction ( hereafter called _ smooth _ ) .",
    "the semi - annuli were chosen to maximize photon statistics at several radii along the direction of interest ( perpendicular to the sb edge ) .",
    "2 shows a comparison between the sb and temperature profiles .",
    "the temperatures were typically obtained through spectral fits using an absorbed mekal model , where the hydrogen column density was a free parameter . despite the apparent smoothness of the average sb profile ( in black )",
    "it is clear that the density profiles towards different directions are irregular , especially along the _ sb_sharp__sb_smooth _ axis .",
    "the position of the sharp edge is shown by a red vertical red line ( at @xmath13 82 kpc ) , where there is a strong decline in sb : a factor of @xmath02 within @xmath010 kpc , accompanied by a temperature rise from @xmath14 kev to 5.20@xmath15 kev .",
    "the gas pressure is roughly constant ( within the errors ) throughout the discontinuity , which is consistent with the cf phenomenon ( markevitch et al .",
    "the temperature profile within 82 kpc also exhibit strong anisotropies . towards the _ sharp _ direction",
    "the temperature rises more or less steadily from 1.66@xmath16 to 4.06@xmath17 kev .",
    "the addition of a cooling flow model in the inner 10@xmath18 does not change significantly the best - fit parameters and does not improve the @xmath19 .",
    "the minimum cooling flow temperature found is @xmath200.96 kev , with an associated mass deposition rate of @xmath05 @xmath21 yr@xmath6 . towards",
    "the _ smooth _ side the temperature rises steadily outward to a radial distance of 25 kpc and then rises steeply from 2.73 @xmath22 kev to 4.30 @xmath23 kev within a span of 15 kpc .",
    "the temperature profile suggests the presence of a secondary cf at @xmath0 25 kpc , although there is no clear association with a sb drop within the same region .",
    "this may be due to the azimuthally symmetric binning geometry being a poor match to the oblique front structure to the south . at r @xmath24 25",
    "kpc the gas temperature has a flat profile throughout .",
    "spectral fittings of the central region on the _ smooth _ side are significantly improved with the addition of a cooling flow component .",
    "the resulting best fit temperature is 3.2@xmath25 0.7 kev with a mass deposition rate of 4.6@xmath251.3 @xmath21 yr@xmath6 and @xmath9 = 0.57@xmath26 kev .",
    "the spectral fittings when individual abundances were allowed to vary independently ( vmekal ) were slightly better than those where the abundances were tied to their solar ratios , as previously found in _ asca _",
    "data by dupke & white ( 2000a ) .",
    "3 shows temperature and abundance profiles of the best constrained elements ( fe , si , o and s ) in radial slices through the whole region analyzed in this work .",
    "temperature and iron abundance ( @xmath27 ) anisotropies are clearly seen .",
    "the radial binning in fig .  3 is larger than that in fig .",
    "this choice of binning increased the significance and magnitude of the temperature jump across the cf .",
    "the temperature jumps from 3.57@xmath28 kev to 5.60@xmath29 kev across the cf .",
    "note that @xmath27 does not change across the cf .",
    "the @xmath27 profile is remarkably flat towards the _ sharp _ direction , with an average value of @xmath00.75 solar . towards",
    "the _ smooth _ direction @xmath27 has a marginal rise from 0.59@xmath30 solar at the center to 0.87@xmath31 solar at @xmath0 70 kpc .",
    "it then declines again to a minimum value of 0.49@xmath32 solar towards the outer regions .",
    "we used the f - test to estimate the significance of the fe abundance gradient towards the _ smooth _ side .",
    "we verified that the abundance gradient in the fourth and fifth radial bins is significant at @xmath24 98% confidence .",
    "this off - center abundance peak is similar to that found by sanders & fabian ( 2002 ) in a3526 and by johnstone et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in a2199 .",
    "however , the addition of a cooling flow component to the innermost spatial bin ( @xmath3322@xmath18 ) improves the spectral fits significantly , increasing the best fit @xmath27 to 1.52@xmath34 solar , eliminating the central depression . adding the same cooling flow component to the _ sharp _ central region does not change significantly @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution of the silicon abundance ( @xmath35 ) shows a negative gradient towards both _",
    "sharp _ and _ smooth _ sides .",
    "the gradient is steeper but consistent with that measured in full ( 0 - 2@xmath36 ) annular regions with _",
    "xmm _ data ( tamura et al .  2001 ) .",
    "the oxygen abundance ( @xmath37 ) tends to rise radially towards both _",
    "sharp _ and _ smooth _ directions . by simultaneously fitting the spectra of the inner bins from the _ sharp _ and _ smooth _ sides",
    ", we measured a best fit central @xmath37 of 0.60@xmath38 solar , which is significantly lower than in the outermost bin of the _ smooth _ side ( @xmath39 solar ) .",
    "this trend is consistent with _",
    "_ sis measurements ( dupke & white 2000a ) but was not observed by tamura et al .",
    "however , the sizes of the extraction regions used in their work are not directly comparable to ours . furthermore , as it can be seen from fig .  3",
    ", their choice of region configuration can smooth out the @xmath37 gradient due to the asymmetries in the abundance profile .",
    "the central absolute @xmath37 values are higher than those found in a preliminary _ chandra _ analysis of dupke & white ( 2001 ) , who used the least flare - contaminated period of a previous observation of a496 without any correction for qe degradation .",
    "the sulfur abundance is not well constrained and is consistent with being flat .",
    "overall , @xmath35 and @xmath37 distributions are consistent with radial gradients , but there are no discontinuities across the cfs .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the abundance ratio profiles . since different types of sne have characteristic mass yields for different elements , their relative pollution rate can be measured , in principle , via abundance ratios ( cf .",
    "loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) , which in turn help us to determine the enrichment history of the gas .",
    "it can be seen that both o / fe and si / fe are consistent with a central ( @xmath40 80 kpc ) dominance of sn ia ejecta .",
    "however , both ratios show radial gradients and their outer values do not agree on a single proportion of sn ia / ii ejecta at a given exterior radius .",
    "the low si / fe ratios between 100200 kpc are driven mainly by the low values of @xmath35 in that region .",
    "a positive gradient in the o / fe was also detected in dupke & white ( 2001 ) and it is unlikely that further calibration improvements will affect significantly the o / fe profile , although the absolute values of the individual abundances are more uncertain . the poor photon statistics of our observation do not allow us to constrain other ratios well enough to check for the self - consistency of abundance ratios using different theoretical sn models , as in dupke & white ( 2000b ) .",
    "however , independently of absolute normalizations , it is clear that there is no significant change in abundance ratio distribution across the sharp boundaries of the cfs .",
    "two recently proposed hypotheses for generating cfs in clusters involve the infall of galaxy groups into the larger clusters . in some cases the substructures are sub(/trans)sonic remnants of mergers ( e.g. markevitch et al .",
    "2000 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "in other cases , such as a1795 ( markevitch et al .  2001 ) , it is proposed that the infall of a small gravitational substructure disturbs the central gravitational potential of the main cluster , causing low - entropy gas in the center to oscillate around some equilibrium position ( the `` sloshing '' hypothesis ) . in both cases",
    "one expects the cf to be a surface discontinuity between a cold core moving through hotter , diffuse intracluster gas , with inefficient mixing between the different gas phases across the surface discontinuity . if this were true for a496 one should expect to see different metal enrichment histories across the cf .",
    "we find instead that abundances and abundance ratios are continuous across cfs , a result that is independent of calibration uncertainties in determining the absolute abundances of individual elements .",
    "the data is roughly consistent with a model where the cd is oscillating around the clusters potential well .",
    "this model is similar to that suggested for a1795 ( fabian et al .",
    "2001 ) . in both clusters",
    "the cfs are aligned with the most likely projected axis of motion of the cd .",
    "this axis is inferred by analysis of the direction of the main extension of optical filaments ( see fabian et al .  1981 ) , x - ray and optical isophotal elongation .",
    "the cds in both systems have similar peculiar velocities after correcting for substructure ( bird 1994 ) . in this model",
    "the cd would be dragging / smearing sn ia fe enriched cold gas within the spatial oscillation length ( @xmath0 80 kpc ) , which defines the distance to farthest cf observed . the most likely evolutionary time frame for this model would place the cd in a496 moving south beginning to generate a second cf .",
    "the motion of the cd may add to other competing core heating mechanisms , which may keep @xmath9 @xmath41 kev .",
    "a detailed analysis of this model and other alternates is beyond the scope of this _ letter _ and will be published elsewhere .",
    "the investigation of the behavior of abundances and their ratios across sb discontinuities in the cores of other clusters will allow us to determine whether such structures are typically induced externally , via subcluster mergers , or internally , perhaps through sloshing associated with cd motion .",
