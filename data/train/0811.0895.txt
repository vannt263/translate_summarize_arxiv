    "elastic hadron - hadron scattering , the simplest type of hadronic collision process , remains one of the topical theoretical problems in fundamental interaction physics at present . in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic scattering , although many experiments have been made over an extended range of initial energies and momentum transfer , these reactions are still not well understood .",
    "the nuclear slope @xmath2 for elastic scattering is of interest in its own right .",
    "this quantity defined according to the following equation : @xmath3\\right|_{t=0 } , \\label{slope - def}\\ ] ] is determined experimentally . on the other hand",
    "the study of @xmath2 parameter is important , in particular , for reconstruction procedure of full set of helicity amplitudes for elastic nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "the present status of slope for elastic @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering is discussed over the full energy domain .",
    "we have attempted to describe the energy behaviour of the elastic nuclear slopes for @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions .",
    "specifically , we have focused on the low @xmath4 domain .",
    "the ensemble of experimental data on slopes for elastic nucleon collisions can be fitted successfully by many phenomenological models , at least for @xmath5 gev .",
    "the new `` expanded '' logarithmic parameterizations have been suggested in @xcite for description of the elastic slope at all available energies . thus taking into account standard regge parameterization and quadratic function of logarithm from @xcite the following analytic equations are under study here : @xmath6^{a_{3 } } , & ( 2b ) \\label{fit-2}\\\\ \\hspace*{3.0 cm } b\\left(s\\right)= & b_{0}+2a_{1}\\ln\\left(s / s_{0}\\right)+a_{2}\\left(s / s_{0}\\right)^{a_{3 } } , & ( 2c ) \\label{fit-3}\\\\ \\hspace*{3.0 cm } b\\left(s\\right)= & b_{0}+2a_{1}\\ln\\left(s / s_{0}\\right)+a_{2}\\left [ \\ln\\left(s / s_{0}\\right)\\right]^{2 } , & ( 2d ) \\label{fit-4 } \\end{array}\\vspace*{-0.25cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 gev@xmath8 , in general case parameters @xmath9 depend on range of @xmath4 which is used for approximation .",
    "experimental data are from @xcite .",
    "total number of experimental points is equal 133 / 129 for @xmath10 scattering at low @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "thus the experimental sample is significantly larger than that for some early investigations @xcite .",
    "as known the measurements of nuclear slope , especially at intermediate @xmath4 do not form a smooth set in energy , in contrast to the situation for global scattering parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where there is a good agreement between various group data @xcite .",
    "thus the data samples for approximations are somewhat smaller because of exclusion of points which differ significantly from the other experimental points at close energies .",
    "the maximum fraction of excluded points is equal 3.1% for low @xmath4 domain .    the energy dependence for experimental slopes and corresponding fits by ( 2a)(2d )",
    "are shown at fig.1a and fig.1b for @xmath0 and @xmath1 correspondingly .",
    "the fitting parameter values are indicated in table 1 .",
    "the available systematic errors were added in quadrature to the statistical errors at calculation of resulting errors for fitted data points .",
    "one can see that the fitting functions ( 2a ) , ( 2d ) describe the @xmath0 ( fig.1a ) and @xmath1 ( fig.1b ) experimental data statistically acceptable only for @xmath13 gev .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 for function ( 2a ) agree with estimate for pomeron intercept @xmath15 gev@xmath16 for @xmath1 data but this parameter is some larger than @xmath17 for proton - proton data .",
    "one can see the @xmath18 parameter is equal zero within errors for approximation of @xmath1 data by ( 2d ) .",
    "thus the function ( 2d ) can be excluded from the set of approximation functions for @xmath1 at low @xmath4 values . the rhic point for proton - proton collisions",
    "has a large error and ca nt discriminates the approximations .",
    "the parameterizations ( 2b ) , ( 2c ) allow to describe experimental data at all energies with reasonable fit quality for @xmath0 .",
    "the functions ( 2a)(2c ) are close to each other at @xmath13 gev , especially , the regge model approximation and ( 2c ) fit .",
    "it seems the ultra - high energy domain is suitable for separation of various parameterizations .",
    "the qualities of ( 2b ) , ( 2c ) approximations for @xmath1 elastic scattering data are much poorer because of very sharp behaviour of experimental data near the low energy boundary .",
    "but one can see that the functions ( 2b ) , ( 2c ) agree with experimental points at qualitative level and ( very ) close to each other for all energy range .    [",
