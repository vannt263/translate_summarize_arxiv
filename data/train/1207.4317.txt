    "recently , electronic - structure calculations have become an important tool for investigating the physics and chemistry of nanoscale systems with the miniaturization of electronic devices .",
    "the electron - transport properties of nanoscale systems have been studied actively because they are of significant importance from both fundamental and practical points of view .",
    "owing to the complexity of the problem , such studies are strongly dependent on the existence of reliable numerical treatments based on first - principles approaches .",
    "a number of first - principles calculation methods for the electron - transport properties of nanoscale systems have been proposed so far .",
    "they are roughly categorized into two approaches .",
    "one approach uses the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) .",
    "the relation between conductance and green s function has been derived within the nonequilibrium keldysh formalism.@xcite this approach has been used extensively in connection with tight - binding models and first - principles methods employing localized basis sets consisting of either atomic orbitals@xcite or gaussians.@xcite in this formalism , by making use of green s functions with energies of nonreal numbers , the electronic structures of the isolated states in the transition region , which are not easily treated only by the energies of real numbers , can be included into the total charge density of the system .",
    "on the other hand , the negf method has not been employed with the real - space@xcite and plane - wave formalisms so far because the large numbers of grid points or plane waves prevent the direct inversion of @xmath0-dimensional matrices to obtain the surface green s functions and self - energy terms of electrodes , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the numbers of grid points along the @xmath4- , @xmath5- , and @xmath6-directions in the unit cell of the left or right electrode and electrons flow along the @xmath6-direction [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ] .",
    "the other approach is to compute the scattering wave functions from which transmission coefficients can be obtained .",
    "in addition , the scattering wave functions provide a direct real - space picture of the scattering process .",
    "this approach has been employed by combining it with techniques where real - space grids and/or plane wave basis sets@xcite are used to describe wave functions and potentials .",
    "the easiest way to obtain scattering wave functions is to solve the lippman - schwinger equation where the semi - infinite electrode is replaced with a uniformly distributed charge background , i.e. , `` jellium.''@xcite the scattering wave function can alternatively be calculated by the wave - function - matching approach proposed by fujimoto and hirose , i.e. , the overbridging boundary - matching ( obm ) method.@xcite in the obm method , several parts of green s functions of the transition region are computed to set up the wave - function - matching formula and there is no limitation of the usage of jellium , i.e. , more realistic atomic and electronic structures of the electrode can be taken into account . moreover ,",
    "the effect of electrodes is included in the matching formula as @xmath7-dimensional ratio matrices , where @xmath8 is the order of the finite - difference approximation@xcite for the kinetic energy operator in the kohn - sham equation and is much smaller than @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the real - space finite - difference ( rsfd ) negf scheme and demonstrate that the surface green s functions and self - energy terms of the electrodes required in the negf method can be obtained from the ratio matrices in the obm method .",
    "the dimension of the matrices for the surface green s functions and self - energy terms that are directly inverted is reduced from @xmath0 to @xmath7 in the present scheme while keeping the rigorousness of the mathematical formulation .",
    "this advantage also saves computational effort to calculate green s functions in the transition region because the number of elements of the greens - function matrix required for the transport calculation is proportional to the dimension of the matrices of the self - energy terms .",
    "in addition , we prove that scattering wave functions , which help us to interpret the scattering process and are usually calculated by wave function matching methods , can be obtained within the framework of the rsfd negf method .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we relate the important quantities of the negf method to those of the obm scheme , and introduce the rsfd negf method . in sec .",
    "iii , we present an example showing that scattering wave functions help us to interpret the scattering process by computing the transport properties of a bn ring sandwiched between carbon nanotube electrodes ( c / bnnt ) . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize our procedures . finally , a mathematical proof is given in appendix .",
    "let us consider green s function of a system composed of the transition region sandwiched between two semi - infinite crystalline electrodes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , within the framework of the rsfd scheme .",
    "two - dimensional periodicity in the @xmath4- and @xmath5-directions is assumed and a generalized @xmath6-coordinate @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 is used , because a couple of grid planes are involved in wave - function and greens - function matching when higher - order finite - difference approximation is employed ( see fig .",

    "<S> we demonstrate an efficient nonequilibrium green s function transport calculation procedure based on the real - space finite - difference method . </S>",
    "<S> the direct inversion of matrices for obtaining the self - energy terms of electrodes is computationally demanding in the real - space method because the matrix dimension corresponds to the number of grid points in the unit cell of electrodes , which is much larger than that of sites in the tight - binding approach . </S>",

    "<S> b * 67 * , 195315 ( 2003 ) ] , which is related to the wave functions of a couple of grid planes in the matching regions , greatly reduces the computational effort to calculate self - energy terms without losing mathematical strictness . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the present procedure saves computational time to obtain green s function of the semi - infinite system required in the landauer - bttiker formula . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the compact expression to relate green s functions and scattering wave functions , which provide a real - space picture of the scattering process , is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> an example of the calculated results is given for the transport property of the bn ring connected to ( 9,0 ) carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function matching at the interface reveals that the rotational symmetry of wave functions with respect to the tube axis plays an important role in electron transport . </S>",
    "<S> since the states coming from and going to electrodes show threefold rotational symmetry , the states in the vicinity of the fermi level , whose wave function exhibits fivefold symmetry , do not contribute to the electron transport through the bn ring . </S>"
