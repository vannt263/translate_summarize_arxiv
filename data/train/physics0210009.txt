    "two shear - driven flows bear the name of couette : the flow between differentially rotating concentric cylinders is called cylindrical couette flow , or more commonly , taylor - couette flow , while the flow between infinite parallel plates translating at different velocities while maintaining a constant separation is called plane couette flow . exact solutions , both called couette solutions , to the navier - stokes equations for each of these configurations are easily calculated and serve as illustrations in most textbooks .",
    "each of these two flows has become a paradigm of hydrodynamic stability theory .",
    "taylor - couette flow can be considered to be a paradigm of understanding . in 1923",
    ", taylor @xcite carried out calculations of the linear instability of couette flow to the onset of axisymmetric vortices and compared these with experiment , obtaining agreement which remains remarkable even by today s standards .",
    "in later research , increasingly ornate and beautiful experimental patterns were discovered , e.g. @xcite , and correspondingly elaborate numerical , asymptotic , and theoretical calculations , e.g. @xcite , reproduced and explained these patterns , again with remarkable accuracy ; see @xcite .",
    "plane couette flow , on the other hand , can be considered to be a paradigm of mystery . for plane",
    "parallel flows , squire s theorem @xcite firmly establishes that the linear instability with the lowest critical reynolds number is spanwise invariant .",
    "armed with this theorem , researchers have long known , and more recently proved @xcite , that plane couette flow is linearly stable at all reynolds numbers . yet , in laboratory experiments @xcite and in numerical simulations @xcite , plane couette flow undergoes sudden transition to three - dimensional turbulence . since at least the 1960 s researchers have explored various mechanisms for transition in plane couette flow which bypass linear instability and squire s theorem .",
    "an element shared by all of these approaches , independent of the theoretical mechanism proposed for instability , is the presence of streamwise vortices @xcite , i.e. perturbations which , unlike those deemed critical by squire s theorem , are not spanwise invariant , but are instead invariant or almost invariant in the streamwise direction .",
    "these are analogous to the taylor vortices which , in taylor - couette flow , are the eigenvectors responsible for the linear instability and are realized in experiments and in nonlinear numerical simulations .",
    "one major line of research has focused on the effect of the non - normality of the operator governing the linear stability of plane couette flow @xcite .",
    "such operators may lead to transient growth dynamics , even in the absence of linear instability , allowing nonlinear effects to take over before the final exponential decay exhibited by the linear evolution .",
    "plane couette flow can exhibit transient growth of several orders of magnitude ; the initial conditions which maximize the transient growth , called optimal perturbations , contain streamwise vortices .",
    "transient growth is closely associated with the sensitivity of the spectrum to small perturbations of the operator , quantified by the pseudospectra @xcite .",
    "the concepts of pseudospectra , non - normality , transient growth , and optimal perturbations , have been rarely applied to taylor - couette flow @xcite , probably because conventional linear stability analysis is so successful in explaining the transitions observed .",
    "however , the large parameter space of taylor - couette flow offers the possibility of tuning the system from a normal operator , which does not support any transient growth , to a highly non - normal operator .",
    "because of translational and galilean invariance , plane couette flow depends only on the distance @xmath11 between the plates , the relative velocity @xmath12 of the plates , and the kinematic viscosity @xmath13 , which are combined into a single nondimensional parameter , the reynolds number defined conventionally as @xmath14 . in contrast , because of curvature effects in taylor - couette flow , both the inner and outer radii @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( or gapwidth @xmath17 and average radius @xmath18 ) play a role . because transformation to a rotating reference frame would introduce a coriolis term into the equations , the flow depends on the angular velocities of both the inner and the outer cylinders , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the five dimensional parameters can be combined into three non - dimensional parameters in various ways .",
    "our choice is @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the idea of trying to approach the stability of plane couette flow via taylor - couette flow is an appealing one and has inspired a number of investigations .",
    "the axisymmetric taylor - vortex solution undergoes a secondary bifurcation to a non - axisymmetric wavy - vortex solution @xcite . in a search for states intermediate in complexity between the couette solution and turbulent plane couette flow ,",
    "nagata @xcite took the limits of a narrow gap and almost corotating cylinders and discovered that , while the taylor - vortex solution ceases to exist as the coriolis term ( i.e. the average angular velocity ) is decreased , the wavy - vortex solution could be continued to the plane couette limit .",
    "faisst & eckhardt @xcite showed that these wavy solutions also exist for counter - rotating cylinders and that the lowest reynolds number at which they first appear ( via a saddle - node bifurcation ) becomes independent of the rotation ratio as @xmath24 . finally , prigent and dauchot @xcite have discovered that an analog of the spiral turbulence state of taylor - couette flow also exists for plane couette flow .",
    "our investigation goes somewhat in the opposite direction .",
    "while the investigations cited above considered steady or traveling states known to exist in taylor - couette flow and continued them to the plane couette limit , we take the ideas of pseudospectra , non - normality , transient growth , and optimal perturbations , apply them to taylor - couette flow and investigate the limit as taylor - couette flow approaches plane couette flow .",
    "we focus on a given representative azimuthal and axial wavenumber and explore the stability characteristics of counter - rotating taylor - couette flow for a range of reynolds numbers and radius ratios . in a related study ,",
    "meseguer @xcite studied transient effects ",
    "optimized over azimuthal and axial wavenumbers  for a specified radius ratio and varying reynolds number and angular velocity ratio .",
    "since taylor - couette flow is linearly stable for @xmath25 , meseguer suggests that transient growth plays an important role in the transition to turbulence observed experimentally @xcite for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , a theory contested by gebhardt & grossman @xcite .",
    "why calculate transient growth in taylor - couette flow , one of the major success stories of linear stability theory ?",
    "transient growth is a new tool in linear stability theory , whose worth and longevity have yet to be proved .",
    "it has up to now been applied to flows in which transition from the basic laminar state is not understood .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to calculate transient growth in taylor - couette flow , in which transition is believed to be completely understood by hydrodynamicists .",
    "this could provide information about the value and significance of transient growth calculations .",
    "the other side of the coin is that the paradigmatic status of taylor - couette flow should be maintained .",
    "as new tools or measurements become available , they should be brought to bear on this basic flow in order for hydrodynamicists to extract additional knowledge about taylor - couette flow .",
    "the couette solution is the unique solution of the form @xmath27 to the incompressible navier - stokes equations :    @xmath28    [ ns ]    distances have been nondimensionalized by @xmath29 and velocities by @xmath30 .",
    "we recall that @xmath31 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the inner and outer cylindrical radii and angular velocities , respectively , and @xmath13 is the kinematic viscosity . definition ( [ redef ] ) of @xmath32 , chosen for compatibility with the plane couette convention for the case @xmath33 , differs by a factor of two from the conventional definition employed in taylor - couette flow .",
    "the average radius is @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the limit @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath35 ; we refer to either of these limits as convenient .",
    "the couette solution is :    @xmath36    [ couette ]    the expressions for @xmath37 and @xmath38 again differ from the standard ones by factors of two due to our use of @xmath29 as unit of length .",
    "expression ( [ couette ] ) can be viewed as a superposition of solid body rotation , @xmath39 , and the flow due to a point vortex , @xmath40 . as @xmath24 ,",
    "the leading terms of these two contributions become equal and opposite : @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , we therefore rewrite ( [ couette ] ) in the following equivalent form not subject to this cancellation error : @xmath43 \\label{nocancel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44    the equations we consider are the navier - stokes equations ( [ ns ] ) linearized about the couette solution ( [ couette ] ) or ( [ nocancel ] ) :    @xmath45    subject to the boundary conditions @xmath46 [ navierstokescyl ]    with @xmath47    the taylor - couette geometry and the couette solution are homogeneous in the azimuthal ( @xmath48 ) and axial ( @xmath49 ) direction , which are analogous to the streamwise ( @xmath50 ) and spanwise ( @xmath49 ) directions in plane couette flow .",
    "table  [ tableequiv ] summarizes the equivalence of the coordinate systems for plane couette and taylor - couette flow .",
    "solutions to ( [ navierstokescyl ] ) which are spatially bounded are therefore trigonometric in each of these directions , with wavenumbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53    the parameter space is too vast to permit full exploration . in this study , we limit ourselves to @xmath33 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we choose @xmath33 so that the average angular velocity vanishes .",
    "the choice @xmath54 of axisymmetric perturbations is made for simplicity . in plane couette flow ,",
    "the transient growth achieved by streamwise - independent perturbations is , while not maximal , very close to the optimal value .",
    "although the study of transient growth in taylor - couette flow is relatively unexplored , its linear instability has been extensively studied , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the linear instability undergone by taylor - couette flow with counter - rotating cylinders is usually non - axisymmetric and leads to spirals rather than vortices .",
    "however , the threshold associated with axisymmetric perturbations is very close to the actual non - axisymmetric threshold .",
    "indeed , the thresholds are so close that the instability was thought to be axisymmetric until 1966 , when calculations by krueger , gross and diprima @xcite confirmed experimentally by coles @xcite showed the first instability to be non - axisymmetric for @xmath56 sufficiently negative , more precisely @xmath57 in the narrow - gap limit .",
    "note that the correspondence between the streamwise wavenumber @xmath58 of plane couette flow and the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath51 of taylor - couette flow is @xmath59 , since @xmath60 . setting @xmath51 to correspond to a fixed non - zero value of @xmath58 would thus require increasing @xmath51 through integer values as @xmath24 or @xmath35 .",
    "the choice @xmath61 corresponds to an axial wavelength of 4 .",
    "since our choice of length scales dictates that the radial gap is of width 2 , this means that a single vortex has the same axial as radial extent , i.e. is approximately circular .",
    "the axial wavelength corresponding to linear instability is somewhat smaller than this for counter - rotating cylinders by as much as 20% , but is nonetheless close .",
    "we eliminate @xmath62 and @xmath63 by using ( [ nscylz ] ) and the condition of incompressibility ( [ incomp ] ) , obtaining evolution equations in @xmath64 .",
    "the perturbations @xmath65 are represented as series of chebyshev polynomials in @xmath66 , which are evaluated at the gauss - lobatto points @xcite .",
    "the evolution equation is written symbolically for the state vector @xmath67 as @xmath68 the axial velocity component @xmath62 is calculated from @xmath65 via incompressibility .",

    "we tested our taylor - couette code in a number of ways .",
    "first , we took the limit @xmath24 while maintaining a fixed reynolds number and verified that we obtained the same asymptotic growth rates as in plane couette flow .",
    "we then took @xmath24 and verified that the critical reynolds numbers were those obtained by krueger et al .",

    ", we use the energy norm defined by : @xmath69 with @xmath70 the energy norm is particularly significant in hydrodynamics , because the nonlinear terms of the navier - stokes equations conserve energy .",
    "this lends significance to the study of the linearized equations ( [ navierstokescyl ] ) , since any energy growth that takes place must occur via linear mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the maximal energy growth at time @xmath71 for @xmath72 evolving according to ( [ evolnumer ] ) is defined by : @xmath73 thus the maximal energy growth is given by the energy norm of the operator @xmath74 .",
    "the norm of a normal operator is its dominant eigenvalue @xmath75 ; this is the largest factor by which matrix multiplication can increase the norm of a vector . for a non - normal operator , cross - terms between non - orthogonal eigenvectors typically contribute to the norm of a vector . instead , it is the singular vectors which are orthogonal ; the norm of the operator is given by the largest singular value @xmath76 .",
    "the singular value @xmath76 and its corresponding normalized right and left singular vectors @xmath77 , @xmath78 satisfy : @xmath79 i.e. linear evolution from initial condition @xmath80 leads to the state @xmath81 .",
    "the statements above are all inner - product dependent : an operator is normal or not and vectors are orthogonal or not with respect to a particular inner product .",
    "the singular value decomposition is inner - product dependent as well .",
    "since we investigate growth in the energy norm , we seek the largest singular value and its corresponding left and right singular vectors in the energy norm as well .",
    "standard software , however , provides singular value decompositions with respect to the 2-norm .",
    "additionally , each of the values on the gauss - lobatto grid points must be multiplied by a weight appropriate for calculating the energy ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we compute the elements @xmath82 of an @xmath83 hermitian matrix @xmath84 by taking the inner products , derived from ( [ energy ] ) , between two eigenfunctions @xmath85 and @xmath86 of @xmath87 the cholesky factorization of @xmath88 is then used to convert the energy norm of the operator exponential to an @xmath89-norm of the weighted matrix exponential according to    @xmath90    with @xmath91 as an @xmath83 diagonal matrix consisting of the eigenvalues of @xmath92 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",

    "the optimal growth is defined as @xmath94 if @xmath95 has an eigenvalue with positive imaginary part , then @xmath96 grows exponentially in time ( for any norm ) and so @xmath97 .",
    "thus calculations of optimal growth are meaningful only for operators which are linearly stable .",
    "we also wish to keep track of the quantities responsible for achieving the maxima in ( [ gt ] ) and ( [ gmax ] ) .",

    "as shown in figure [ tcoptgr ] , for @xmath179 , the optimal transient growth for fixed @xmath32 occurs at an intermediate value of @xmath0 ranging from @xmath180 at @xmath118 to @xmath181 at @xmath182 . for @xmath183 , the optimal transient growth for",
    "fixed @xmath32 increases as @xmath0 is decreased from the plane couette limit @xmath178 to the linear stability boundary @xmath127 , as shown in figure [ closeup ] .",
    "if transient growth on the order of @xmath184 is suspected to initiate transition in plane couette flow near @xmath185 , then transition should also occur near @xmath185 outside the linear instability domain in taylor - couette flow , albeit in very narrow gaps ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "if these predictions fail to hold , then theories concerning transition initiated by transient growth must be modified or even abandoned . another possible direction for future studies concerns regions of @xmath187 in which transient growth competes with linear instability ;",
    "such situations should be included in a comprehensive theory of transition initiated by non - normal effects .",
    "two cases have been considered in detail : @xmath10 , @xmath132 and @xmath9 , @xmath129 .",
    "both show transient growth .",
    "as could be expected , the case @xmath10 , @xmath132 , shows much higher transient growth , both because of its greater resemblance to plane couette flow and also because of its higher reynolds number .",
    "as shown in figure [ timeseries ] , for @xmath10 , @xmath132 , energy grows from the optimal input by a factor of @xmath188 , while for @xmath9 , @xmath129 , we have @xmath189 .    as is the case for plane couette flow , the physical mechanism accompanying transient growth consists of the conversion of vortices ( here , termed azimuthal rather than streamwise ) into streaks , i.e. perturbations of the basic couette profile .",
    "this is seen in the ratio of azimuthal to meridional energy in figure [ timeseries ] of the optimal inputs @xmath100 and outputs @xmath102 .",
    "the optimal outputs , depicted in figures [ tcpert50 ] and [ tcpert99 ] , are of higher amplitude near the inner cylinder , especially in the case @xmath9 , @xmath129 , as indicated by rayleigh s criterion for centrifugal instability illustrated in figure [ tcangmom ] .",
    "our study is restricted to the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath111 , axial wavenumber @xmath61 and angular velocity ratio @xmath33 .",
    "previous results on couette flows lead us to believe that these values of @xmath190 may be representative of a fairly large portion of parameter space , since both the maximal optimal growth rate in plane couette flow and the maximal linear growth rate in taylor couette flow are close to those achieved for @xmath191 , @xmath61 .",
    "varying @xmath56 , however , leads to major qualitative changes , as it does in other aspects of taylor - couette flow .",
    "studies encompassing a wide range of parameter values @xcite are clearly desirable .    in the words of faisst & eckhardt @xcite",
    ", taylor - couette flow provides an `` embedding '' of plane couette flow .",
    "numerical simulations and laboratory experiments have extensively documented the way in which plane couette flow changes as its single non - dimensional parameter , the reynolds number , is increased .",
    "taylor - couette flow provides an ensemble of other parameter paths along which to approach or to step back from plane couette flow .",
    "our hope is that this preliminary study and that of @xcite of transient growth and pseudospectra in taylor - couette flow , will help to increase understanding of both taylor - couette flow and of the effects of non - normality .",
