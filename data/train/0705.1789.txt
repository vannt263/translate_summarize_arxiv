    "under the classical networking paradigm , in which intermediate nodes are only allowed to store and forward packets , information security is usually viewed as an independent feature with little or no relation to other communication tasks .",
    "in fact , since intermediate nodes receive exact copies of the sent packets , data confidentiality is commonly ensured by cryptographic means at higher layers of the protocol stack . breaking with the ruling paradigm ,",
    "network coding allows intermediate nodes to mix information from different data flows  @xcite and thus provides an intrinsic level of data security  arguably one of the least well understood benefits of network coding .",
    "previous work on this issue has been mostly concerned with constructing codes capable of spliting the data among different links , such that reconstruction by a wiretapper is either very difficult or impossible . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present a secure linear network code that achieves perfect secrecy against an attacker with access to a limited number of links .",
    "a similar problem is considered in @xcite , featuring a random coding approach in which only the input vector is modified .",
    "@xcite introduces a different information - theoretic security model , in which a system is deemed to be secure if an eavesdropper is unable to get any decoded or decodable ( also called _ meaningful _ ) source data . still focusing on wiretapping attacks",
    ", @xcite provides a simple security protocol exploiting the network topology : an attacker is shown to be unable to get any meaningful information unless it can access those links that are necessary for the communication between the legitimate sender and the receiver , who are assumed to be using network coding . as a distributed capacity - achieving approach for the multicast case ,",
    "randomized network coding @xcite has been shown to extend naturally to packet networks with losses @xcite and byzantine modifications ( both detection and correction @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite adds a cost criterion to the secure network coding problem , providing heuristic solutions for a coding scheme that minimizes both the network cost and the probability that the wiretapper is able to retrieve all the messages of interest .        in this work ,",
    "we approach network coding security from a different angle : our focus is _ not _ on the threat posed by external wiretappers but on the more general threat posed by intermediate nodes .",
    "we assume that the network consists entirely of  nice but curious \" nodes , i.e. they comply with the communication protocols ( in that sense , they are well - behaved ) but may try to acquire as much information as possible from the data that passes through them ( in which case , they are potentially malicious ) .",
    "this notion is highlighted in the following example .",
    "consider the canonical network coding example with @xmath0 nodes , shown in  _ figure  [ fig : bu]_. node @xmath1 sends a flow to sinks @xmath2 and @xmath0 through intermediate nodes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . from the point of security , we can distinguish between three types of intermediate nodes in this setting : ( 1 ) those that only get a non - meaningful part of the information , such as node @xmath6 ; ( 2 ) those that obtain all of the information , such as node @xmath5 ; and ( 3 ) those that get partial yet meaningful information , such as nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 . although this network code could be considered _ secure _ against single - edge external wiretapping  i.e.  , the wiretapper is not able to retrieve the whole data simply by eavesdropping on a single edge  it is clearly insecure against internal eavesdropping by an intermediate node .",
    "motivated by this example , we set out to investigate the security potential of network coding .",
    "our main contributions are as follows :    * _ problem formulation _ : we formulate a secure network coding problem , in which all intermediate nodes are viewed as potential eavesdroppers and the goal is to characterize the intrinsic level of security provided by random linear network coding . *",
    "_ algebraic security criterion _ : based on the notion that the number of decodable bits available to each intermediate node is limited by the degrees of freedom it receives , we are able to provide a natural secrecy constraint for network coding and to prove some of its most fundamental properties . * _ security analysis for complete directed acyclic graphs _ : as a preliminary step towards understanding the interplay between network topology and security against eavesdropping nodes , we present a rigorous characterization of the achievable level of algebraic security for this class of complete graphs .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , a formal problem statement is in _",
    "section  [ sect : problemformulation ] _ , followed by a detailed analysis of the algebraic security of randomized linear network coding in _",
    "section  [ sect : secrlnc]_. in _ section  [ sect : dag ] _ , this analysis is carried out specifically for complete directed acyclic graphs .",
    "the paper concludes with _ section  [ sect : concludingremarks]_.",
    "we adopt the network model of  @xcite : we represent the network as an acyclic directed graph @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the set of nodes and @xmath9 is the set of edges .",
    "edges are denoted by round brackets @xmath10 , in which @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the set of edges that end at a vertex @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath14 , and the in - degree of the vertex is @xmath15 ; similarly , the set of edges originating at a vertex @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath16 , the out - degree being represented by @xmath17 .",
    "discrete random processes @xmath18 are observable at one or more source nodes . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we shall consider that each network link is free of delays and that there are no losses .",
    "moreover , the capacity of each link is one bit per unit time , and the random processes @xmath19 have a constant entropy rate of one bit per unit time . edges with larger capacities are modelled as parallel edges and sources of larger entropy rate are modelled as multiple sources at the same node",
    ". we shall consider multicast connections as it is the most general type of single connection ; there are @xmath20 receiver nodes .",
    "the objective is to transmit all the source processes to each of the receiver nodes .    in linear network coding ,",
    "edge @xmath21 carries the process @xmath22 , which is defined below :    @xmath23    the _ transfer matrix @xmath24 _ describes the relationship between an input vector @xmath25 and an output vector @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent , respectively , the linear mixings of the input vector and of the output vector , and have sizes @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the adjacency matrix of the directed labelled line graph corresponding to the graph @xmath34 . in this paper",
    "we shall not consider matrix @xmath30 , which only refers to the decoding at the receivers .",
    "thus , we shall mainly analyse parts of the matrix @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote column @xmath39 of @xmath29 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we define the _ partial transfer matrix _ @xmath40 ( also called _ auxiliary encoding vector _",
    "@xcite ) as the observable matrix at a given node @xmath41 , i.e.  the observed matrix formed by the symbols received at a node @xmath41 .",
    "this is equivalent to the fraction of the data that an intermediate node has access to in a multicast transmission .    regarding the coding scheme , we consider the random linear network coding scheme introduced in  @xcite : and thus each coefficient of the matrices described above",
    "is chosen independently and uniformly over all elements of a finite field @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the _",
    "intrinsic security _ of random linear network coding , in multicast scenarios where all the intermediate nodes in the network are potentially malicious eavesdroppers .",
    "specifically our threat model assumes that intermediate nodes perform the coding operations as outlined above , and will try to decode as much data as possible .",
    "the shannon criterion for information - theoretic security  @xcite corresponds in general terms to a zero mutual information between the cypher - text ( @xmath44 ) and the original message ( @xmath24 ) ,  i.e.  @xmath45 .",
    "this condition implies that an attacker must guess @xmath46 symbols to be able to compromise the data . with network coding , on the other hand",
    ", if the attacker is capable of guessing @xmath24 symbols , @xmath47 additional observed symbols are required for decoding  by noting that each received symbol is a linear combination of the @xmath48 message symbols from the source , we can see that a receiver must receive @xmath48 coded symbols in order to recover one message symbol .",
    "thus , as will be shown later , restricted rank sets of individual symbols do not translate into immediately decodable data with high probability .",
    "this notion is illustrated in _",
    "figure  [ fig : sc1]_. in the scheme shown on top , each intermediate node can recover half of the transmitted symbols , whereas in the bottom scheme none of the nodes can recover any portion of the sent data .",
    "notice that the previous definition is equivalent to computing the difference between the global rank of the code and the local rank in each intermediate node @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , as more and more symbols become compromised of security criteria , the level of security tends to @xmath49 , since as we shall show in this section , with high probability the number of individually decodable symbols @xmath50 goes to zero as the size of the field goes to infinity .",
    "we are now ready to solve the problem of characterizing the algebraic security of random linear network coding .",
    "the key to our proofs is to analyze the properties of the partial transfer matrix at each intermediate node .",
    "recall that there are two cases in which the intermediate node can gain access to relevant information : ( 1 ) when the partial transfer matrix has full rank and ( 2 ) when the partial transfer matrix has diagonalizable parts .",
    "thus , we shall carry out independent analyzes in terms of rank and in terms of partially diagonalizable matrices",
    ".    the following lemmas will be useful .",
    "[ prop : rank ]    see the _",
    "appendix_.    it follows from this lemma that it is only necessary to consider the case in which @xmath51 .",
    "the probability that a linear combination of independent and uniformly distributed values in @xmath42 yields the zero result is bounded by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a function such that @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 tends to @xmath49 when @xmath56 .",
    "[ prop : lincombfq ]    see the _ appendix_.    [ prop : linetransfermatrix ]    see the _ appendix_.    [ theorem : diag ]    let @xmath57 be the transpose of the partial transfer matrix at some vertex @xmath41 , @xmath58 .",
    "we consider the process of gaussian elimination of @xmath57 .",
    "it is unnecessary to consider rank @xmath48 , since in that case the matrix , w.h.p , is invertible and hence diagonalizable  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath57 is a @xmath59 matrix , @xmath60 .",
    "we prove the theorem constructively by analysing the probability of having @xmath61 zeros in one or more lines of @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the probability of having @xmath61 zeros in a line of @xmath57 , and let @xmath63 be a random variable representing the recoverable number of symbols when an intermediate node has @xmath64 degrees of freedom .",
    "it follows from _",
    "lemma  [ prop : linetransfermatrix ] _ that    @xmath65    in the base case with @xmath66 , at most @xmath67 symbols can be recovered , since there are not enough degrees of freedom to perform gaussian elimination and the only chance for recovering a symbol is that the line of the matrix @xmath24 already has @xmath61 zeros .",
    "the probability for this is @xmath62 .    in the case",
    "that @xmath68 , we can obtain directly a number @xmath69 of lines with @xmath61 zeros , and a number @xmath70 of lines in the opposite situation .",
    "since we have @xmath64 degrees of freedom to perform gaussian elimination , we can obtain at most @xmath64 symbols by successive elimination . at each step the probability of obtaining a line with @xmath61 zeros is bounded by @xmath62 .    by analysing the different possibilities of combinations for the lines that already have @xmath61 zeros and the ones that can be obtained by gaussian elimination , we get @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents @xmath74 .    approximating the binomial distribution by a normal distribution yields @xmath75 where @xmath76 since @xmath77 , we can state that , when @xmath78 and @xmath79 is @xmath80 .",
    "when @xmath48 goes to @xmath81 , so does @xmath82 , and hence @xmath83 and @xmath84 since @xmath85 and @xmath86 decreases exponentially , and @xmath87 only increases linearly , @xmath88 the probability of obtaining @xmath89 symbols is bounded by @xmath90 ; it follows that the probability of decoding @xmath63 symbols with any @xmath91 goes to zero as @xmath92 and @xmath48 tend to infinity .",
    "notice that , in consequence of the property outlined in lemma  [ prop : rank ] , the algebraic security of a graph is topology dependent .",
    "a node with @xmath93 will not necessarily receive a full - rank partial transfer matrix .",
    "the rank depends on the available paths between sources and each intermediate node .",
    "more specifically , depending on the topology of the graph , some nodes may receive only combinations of symbols derived from matrices with restricted rank , i.e.  less than @xmath48 .",
    "this includes , for example , trees , where a node connected directly to the source by a link of capacity @xmath44 can only have children that receive at most rank @xmath44 .    as a first step towards general network models , we consider the case of complete",
    "acyclic directed graphs @xmath94 , @xmath95 , which can be generated as follows .",
    "* generate random labels for the @xmath96 vertices .",
    "these have some ordering @xmath97 associated to them ; * make an outgoing ( directed ) edge from the vertex with the minimum label to every vertex with a higher label ; * continue until we reach a vertex where there are no more possibilities for connections .",
    "this algorithm generates a complete acyclic directed graph with one source , one sink and @xmath98 edges , since the total degree of each vertex is @xmath99 .",
    "the source and the sink are naturally determined as those nodes that have only outgoing edges or only incoming edges , respectively .",
    "the ordering ensures that this algorithm always generates an acyclic directed graph , conferring the graphs generated in this way specific properties such as the distribution of the in and out - degrees .",
    "these properties can be determined directly from the order of the vertex using @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    before proving our next theorem",
    ", we introduce the following lemmas .",
    "[ prop : deltadag2 ]    see the _",
    "[ prop : deltadag1 ]    see the _",
    "appendix_.    suppose , by contradiction , that @xmath102 is the max - flow min - cut capacity of the complete directed acyclic graph .",
    "the maximum order of an intermediate node @xmath41 is @xmath103 , thus by _ lemma  [ prop : deltadag1 ] _ we have @xmath104 .",
    "it follows that the secure max - flow of the complete acyclic directed graph equals the capacity of the graph .    by contradiction , let the minimum number of required symbols for secured transmission be @xmath105 .",
    "there exists an intermediate node @xmath41 such that @xmath106 , and consequently , @xmath107 . then the minimum number of required symbols for secure transmission is @xmath108 .",
    "it follows that the way to secure this class of complete graphs is to transmit at the max - flow min - cut capacity , if necessary by adding `` dummy '' symbols .",
    "intrigued by the security potential inherent to random linear network coding , we developed a specific algebraic security criterion , for which we proved a set of key properties .",
    "perhaps one of the most striking conclusions of our analysis is that algebraic security with network coding is very dependent on the topology of the network . as an example , we focused on complete acyclic directed graphs , and determined the secure max - flow , as well as the minimum number of symbols required for algebraic security . as part of our ongoing work , we are extending this analysis to other more general network models .",
    "ultimately , we would like to develop secure communication protocols capable of exploiting random linear network coding as an _ almost free _ cypher .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge insightful discussions with rui a. costa ( univ . of porto ) .                                      we will prove this constructively in terms of the ranks of parts of the transfer matrix .",
    "the auxiliary encoding vector in each intermediate node @xmath41 is given by @xmath109 where @xmath40 denotes the columns of the matrix corresponding to the incoming edges of @xmath41 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath40 is @xmath110 , with @xmath111 .    to determine the rank of the partial transfer matrix",
    ", we note that the transfer matrix @xmath112 for the network must be invertible , and hence , @xmath113 . on the other hand , to determine the rank of @xmath114 we use the fact that @xmath115 is invertible and thus @xmath116 .",
    "we also have @xmath117 because the dimension of @xmath118 is @xmath31 .",
    "but , since @xmath119 holds and @xmath120 ( true because @xmath48 must be less than the minimum cut in the network ) we conclude that @xmath121    we now consider @xmath122 at some vertex @xmath41 . for that",
    ", we can consider two distinct cases : the first one is if @xmath123 . in this case",
    ", we can not assume anything about @xmath122 , since the rank of the matrix @xmath40 will be dependent on the topology of the network . as for the second case , @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125      contrary to the sum , the product of independent and uniformly distributed values in @xmath42 is _ not _ independent and uniformly distributed . in fact , there are two ways to obtain a zero in a multiplication in @xmath42 : ( 1 ) by multiplication between an element @xmath126 and @xmath49 , and ( 2 ) by multiplication over two elements @xmath127 and @xmath128 , such that @xmath129 and @xmath130 , but @xmath131 .",
    "now , the total number of entries of the multiplicative table between @xmath92 elements of @xmath42 is @xmath132 , and there are at most @xmath133 instances of the first case : q instances of @xmath131 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and @xmath92 instances of @xmath131 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "as for the second case , it is possible to prove by contradiction that the number of zeros obtained this way is strictly less than @xmath132 : if this was not the case , all products of elements of @xmath42 would be zero , and that is absurd .",
    "since this is true for any @xmath92 , the number of zeros grows @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath136 since for large enough @xmath92 we have @xmath137 , it follows that @xmath138 @xmath125      each position of a line of the transfer matrix @xmath24 is a linear combination of independently and uniformly chosen values in @xmath42 , and thus , the probability of obtaining a zero in a position is given by _",
    "lemma  [ prop : lincombfq]_. the result follows by considering all the combinations of the possible positions in which the @xmath139 zeros may occur .",
    "suppose that a given intermediate node receives @xmath140 symbols , @xmath141 .",
    "it is clear that the maximum possible rank is @xmath48 and thus there is a way to remove @xmath142 columns s.t .",
    "the rank of the resulting set will still be at maximum @xmath48 .",
