    "the cosmic ray spectrum spans roughly eleven decades of energy , @xmath2 and has three major features : the steepening of the spectrum dubbed the `` knee '' at @xmath3@xmath4  @xcite , a pronounced hardening of the spectrum at @xmath5 , the so - called `` ankle '' feature  @xcite , and finally a cutoff around @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "three additional more subtle features have been reported between the knee and the ankle : a hardening of the spectrum at around @xmath7  @xcite followed by two softenings at @xmath8  @xcite and and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the latter is traditionally referred to as the `` second knee '' .",
    "the variations of the spectral index reflect various aspects of cosmic ray production , source distribution and propagation .",
    "the first and second knee have straightforward explanations , as reflecting the maximum energy of galactic magnetic confinement or acceleration capability of the sources , both of which grow linearly in the charge @xmath9 of the nucleus ; the first knee being where protons drop out and the second knee where the highest-@xmath9 galactic cosmic rays drop out . as the energy increases above the second knee to the ankle , the composition evolves from heavy to light  @xcite while the cosmic ray arrival directions are isotropic to high accuracy throughout the range  @xcite . finally , as the energy increases above the ankle , not only does the spectrum harden significantly , but the composition gradually becomes heavier ( interpreting the data using conventional extrapolations of accelerator - constrained particle physics models )  @xcite .",
    "this observed evolution in the extragalactic cosmic ray composition and spectral index presents a major conundrum .",
    "a pure proton composition might be compatible with the observed spectrum of extragalactic cosmic rays  @xcite when allowance is made for experimental uncertainties in the energy scale and the fact that the real local source distribution is not homogeneous and continuous  @xcite ( although the sharpness of the ankle is difficult to accommodate ) , but a pure proton composition is incompatible with the depth - of - shower - maximum ( @xmath10 ) distributions observed by auger  @xcite unless current extrapolations of particle physics are incorrect .",
    "moreover , a fit of the spectrum with a pure proton composition seems to require a very strong source evolution  @xcite which leads to a predicted neutrino flux in excess of experimental limits  @xcite . on the other hand , models which fit the spectrum and composition at highest energies ,",
    "predict a deep gap between the end of the galactic cosmic rays and the onset of the extragalactic cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "models can be devised to fill this gap , but fine - tuning is required to position this new population so as to just fit and fill the gap  @xcite .        here",
    "we offer a resolution to this conundrum , by showing that `` post - processing '' of uhecrs via photo - disintegration in the environment surrounding the source , can naturally explain the entire spectrum and composition .",
    "in our model , extragalactic cosmic rays below the ankle are predominantly protons from nucleons knocked off higher energy nuclei in the region surrounding the accelerator , and the spectrum and composition above the ankle are predominantly dictated by the accelerator and propagation to earth .",
    "the model makes distinctive predictions about the spectrum and flavor ratios of neutrinos , which should enable it to be tested .",
    "if the ankle and the protons below it arise on account of our mechanism , we obtain a new constraint on uhecr sources beyond the hillas criterion and total - energy - injection requirements , namely that the environment around the source has the conditions giving rise to the required amount of photo - disintegration .    up until now ,",
    "photo - disintegration ( pd ) has been mainly considered as a danger inside the accelerator , as it would cut off the cosmic ray spectrum at energies such that the pd interaction length and the acceleration length are comparable . since the acceleration length increases with energy , whereas the pd interaction length generally decreases with energy , photo - dissociation acts as a _ low - pass filter_. the insight underlying the mechanism we propose , is that if the primary locus of pd is _ outside _ the accelerator , pd generally acts as a _ high - pass filter _ , permitting the highest energy cosmic rays to escape unscathed while the lower energy ones are disintegrated inside the source region , generating nucleons with energy @xmath11 of the original nucleus of mass @xmath12 . as we shall see , these spallated nucleons naturally produce the ankle feature , explain why extragalactic cosmic rays below the ankle are protonic , and account for the spectral index below the ankle .",
    "examples of systems in which the accelerator is embedded in a photon field and the cosmic rays are trapped by magnetic fields in that environment could be the dusty torus surrounding an active galactic nucleus or the interstellar medium of the star - forming region surrounding most young pulsars ; see also  @xcite .",
    "the basic setup of our phenomenological model is illustrated in fig.[fig : illustration ] .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec.[sec : ankle ] we introduce our model and in sec.[sec : datacomparison ] we compare its predictions with experimental data .",
    "details about particle propagation and the calculation of multi - messenger signatures are given in the appendices .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "to illustrate the mechanism we have identified to create the ankle and generate protons below , consider a system in which the accelerator ( also referred to as the source ) is embedded in an environment in which the cosmic rays are confined for some time by magnetic fields while interacting with the ambient radiation field .",
    "our essential simplifications are : _",
    "( i ) _ a fast acceleration mechanism and/or a low photon density inside the accelerator , _",
    "no energy is lost except through an interaction , and whenever a nucleus interacts it loses one or more nucleons by photo - disintegration or photo - pion production ( in this case the nucleus loses a fraction of its energy corresponding to the reduction in its nuclear mass ) ; _ ( iii ) _  a cosmic ray either escapes without changing energy , with a rate @xmath13 , or the cosmic ray interacts one or more times before escaping ; _ ( iv ) _",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent of position in the source environment and depend only on @xmath15 of the nucleus . in this approximation the number of nuclei in a given energy range and with a specified @xmath16 decreases exponentially with time , with    @xmath17    a fraction @xmath18 of the particles escape without interaction and the rest interact before escaping , so @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath20 and @xmath21 depend only on the ratio of the escape and interaction times , but not on the absolute value of either of them .",
    "a simple analytic treatment is instructive . to illustrate the low / high - pass filter mechanism ,",
    "consider the case that the escape and interaction times are both power laws in energy , @xmath22 then @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ratio of the escape and interaction time at reference energy @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath26 , the source environment acts as a _ low - pass filter _ on the particles injected from the accelerator , leading to a cutoff in the escaping spectrum at high energies .",
    "this situation is typical of leaky box models of diffuse acceleration at time - independent shocks  @xcite where @xmath27 because the higher the energy of the particle , the longer it needs to stay in the accelerator to reach its energy .",
    "by contrast , if the escape time decreases with energy , as in the case of diffusion in turbulent magnetic fields outside the accelerator , then it is possible to have @xmath28 leading to a _ high - pass filter _ on the energy spectrum of injected nuclei : the lower the energy , the more time the nuclei have to interact before escaping , leading to a hardening of the spectrum and lightening of the composition of nuclei escaping the region surrounding the source .",
    "the spallated nucleons have energies of @xmath29 ; these nucleons are most abundant at low energies and have a steeper spectrum @xmath30 .",
    "thus the high - pass scenario leads naturally to an ankle - like feature separating the nucleonic fragments from the remaining nuclei .",
    "the normalization and slope of the spectrum of spallated nucleons relative to that of the primary nuclei is determined by how thoroughly the primary nuclei are disintegrated , which is governed by the ratio of escape and interaction lengths of the most abundant primaries .    to obtain a more realistic treatment of the interaction time",
    ", we must specify the shape of the spectrum of the target photons . in our work to date",
    "we have considered : _",
    "( i ) _  a broken power - law ( bpl ) , characterized by its peak energy @xmath31 and lower and upper spectral indices @xmath32 ( this is a simplified representative of non - thermal emission that allows for analytic calculation as discussed below and in appendix  [ app : appendixb ] ) ; _ ( ii ) _ a black - body spectrum ; _ ( iii ) _ two types of modified black - body spectrum , which result from a reprocessed black - body in a dusty environment  @xcite .",
    "details are given in appendix  [ app : appendixa ] .",
    "for such peaky photon spectra the interaction time does not have the simple representation of ( [ taus ] ) but it does have a rather universal structure . in our actual calculations",
    "we adopt a numerical integration of talys  @xcite and sophia  @xcite cross sections using  @xcite , but the analytic expression for @xmath33 derived in appendix  [ app : appendixb ] for the bpl in the narrow - width approximation for the interaction cross sections , is qualitatively similar and useful for understanding . as can be seen in fig.[fig : vwl ] the folding of a single resonance with a broken power - law spectrum leads to a `` v '' shape curve for @xmath33 in a log - log plot for both photo - disintegration ( top panel ) and photopion production ( middle panel ) .",
    "combining both processes in narrow - resonance approximation yields an interaction time with a `` w '' shape , while numerical integration including the plateau for multi - pion production softens the `` w '' to what we shall refer to as an `` l '' shape for brevity , a shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : vwl ] . as evident from fig.[fig : vwl ] , below the inflection point for photodisintegration @xmath34 , the narrow - resonance approximation is good , while from the full numerical integration in the high - energy region @xmath33 is roughly constant , so using the bpl spectrum , we have the approximate representation : @xmath35 where formulae for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given in appendix  [ app : appendixb ] , and the parameter values for photodisintegration are to be used .",
    "returning to the discussion of @xmath38 in ( [ taus ] ) with ( [ tautau ] ) yields the fraction of nuclei which escape without interaction in a peaky photon spectrum .",
    "it is straightforward to see that if @xmath39 and the interaction time is described by an l - shaped curve , then @xmath40 has the properties of a high - pass filter .",
    "these conclusions do not depend on the exact shape of the photon spectrum .",
    "as can be seen in fig.[app : photon - spectra ] of appendix  [ app : appendixa ] , the interaction times flatten to an l - curve as well if the photon density is assumed to follow a ( modified ) black body spectrum .",
    "as our fiducial example , we adopt a broken power - law photon spectrum as a simplified representative of non - thermal emission given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the photon energy , the maximum photon number density is at an energy of @xmath43 and following  @xcite we take the slope parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as we shall see later , any peaky spectrum gives similar results , with the position of the peak , @xmath43 , being the most important parameter besides the peak photon density .",
    "inspired by the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient for propagation in a turbulent magnetic field , we model @xmath46 as a power law in rigidity @xmath47 , @xmath48 since only the ratio of escape and interaction times matters , and the @xmath15 dependence of this ratio is entirely determined once the spectral index of the escape time @xmath49 is specified , the remaining freedom in characterizing the source environment can be encoded by specifying the ratio of escape to interaction time for a particular choice of @xmath15 , which we take at @xmath50 for iron nuclei , denoted @xmath51 . in application to a particular source candidate ,",
    "@xmath51 depends on the density of photons and the properties of the turbulent magnetic field that delays the escape of the uhecrs from the environment of their source .",
    "figure  [ fig : tau&escspec ] , upper panel , shows the escape and interaction times in the fiducial source environment , as a function of the cosmic ray energy , for proton , he , n , si and fe ; the interaction times are calculated including both photo - disintegration and photo - pion production .",
    "the gross features of the energy dependence of the interaction times can be understood in the approximation of resonant interactions in the nucleus rest frame @xmath52 . at low cosmic - ray energies ,",
    "reaching @xmath52 requires high photon energy ( @xmath53 ) , so that the interaction time decreases with increasing cosmic - ray energy as @xmath54 .",
    "however for high enough cosmic ray energy , the resonance can be reached in collisions with photons of @xmath55 . from here , as the cosmic ray energy increases , the photon density at the resonant energy decreases as @xmath56 , and correspondingly the interaction times increase .",
    "the laboratory energy of the inflection point of the interaction times for a cosmic ray nucleus of mass @xmath57 is at @xmath58 .",
    "the inflection point of the photo - dissociation times can be seen as a dip in the plot in the upper panel of fig.[fig : tau&escspec ] , e.g. , at around @xmath59 for iron nuclei . at slightly higher energy ,",
    "photo - pion production becomes important , with the result that the energy dependence of the interaction time is roughly speaking an l - shaped curve in a log - log presentation .",
    "using these energy - dependent interaction and escape times , we propagate nuclei through the source environment with the procedure described in appendix  [ app : appendixc ]",
    ". cosmic rays of some given composition are injected from the accelerator into the source environment with a power law spectrum and an exponential cutoff at some maximum rigidity . to keep the complexity of the fiducial model to a minimum",
    ", we inject only a single nuclear species and fix the injection spectral index @xmath60 , as expected for acceleration in young neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the particles escaping the source environment are then propagated through the intergalactic medium using the procedure explained in appendix  [ app : appendixd ] .",
    "in total the fiducial model has 14 parameters , with 8 parameters allowed to float freely in the fit , as indicated in table  [ table : fiducial ] .",
    "the spectral index and normalization of the galactic spectrum are free `` nuisance '' parameters with the best fit giving a spectral index of @xmath61 .",
    "this should be understood as an effective spectral index describing the cutoff of the galactic cosmic ray population , and hence can not be directly compared with the parameter reported by the kascade - grande collaboration  @xcite , because their single - power law fit is driven by the `` low - energy '' data .",
    "the fraction of galactic cosmic rays at @xmath1 is 55% .",
    "the best description of the data is obtained with @xmath62si of maximum energy @xmath63  ; the impact of allowing other parameters to vary is discussed in following sections .",
    "normalizing this model to the observed flux at earth , we infer a comoving volumetric energy injection rate in crs at @xmath64 , above @xmath1 , of @xmath65 .",
    "the unmodified injection spectrum and the spectrum of escaping nuclei for this fiducial model are shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig : tau&escspec ] . at low energies ,",
    "the nuclei are depleted relative to the injected flux because @xmath66 , but the escaping nuclei follow the original spectral index because in this example the interaction and escape times are parallel , as to be expected for @xmath67 .",
    "once the corner of the l - shape is reached , the fraction of escaping nuclei grows , leading to an apparent hardening of the spectral index .    even for the simple case in which a single nuclear species is injected into the source environment ,",
    "we obtain a complex evolution of the mass composition with energy . at low energies",
    "the composition is dominated by knock - off nucleons whereas at high energies the composition becomes heavier as the ratio of escape to interaction time drops and more heavy nuclei can escape before interacting .",
    "this fiducial model of interactions in the source environment is a very simple one , yet even so it offers a remarkably good accounting for the flux and composition at earth as determined by the pierre auger observatory .",
    "( data from the telescope array ( ta ) are consistent with the auger results within systematic and statistical uncertainties  @xcite and also can be well - fit ; we come to ta separately below . ) in fig.[fig : fit ] we compare the fiducial model prediction to the auger measured flux , from @xmath1 to above @xmath68  @xcite and to the mean and variance of the distribution of the logarithm of mass on top of the atmosphere , @xmath69 and @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "there is a good overall agreement between the model and the data .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is described well , including the ankle and the flux suppression .",
    "the model also qualitatively reproduces the increase of the average logarithmic mass with energy and the decrease of its variance .",
    "the neutrino signals of the fiducial model are shown in fig.[fig : neutrinos ] ; details of the calculation are given in appendix  [ app : appendixe ] .",
    "an exciting aspect of our model for the ankle is the presence of a detectable anti - electron - neutrino flux from neutron @xmath71-decay , with a rate consistent with the nave estimate of  @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : neutrinos ] shows the number of events as a function of energy predicted in ten years of ic86 , using the icecube acceptance for different neutrino flavors given in  @xcite . in total",
    ", the fiducial model predicts 3.5 events in the range @xmath72  after 10 years of operation of icecube ( corresponding to about one year of operation for an upgraded icecube - gen2 detector  @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize the distinctive @xmath73 enrichment due to beta decay of spallated neutrons .",
    "the associated photon flux from nuclear de - excitation in our model is well below the fermi - lat data ( see appendix  [ app : appendixe ] for more detail ) .",
    "photo - pion interactions at the source and during propagation produce an additional flux of photons via @xmath74-decay ; this is consistent with fermi - lat data , as follows : if the origin of the photons measured by fermi - lat is exclusively from these interactions , then from  @xcite the associated diffuse neutrino flux saturates the icecube upper limit  @xcite .",
    "since the neutrino flux in the fiducial model is below the icecube limit , it follows that also the associated photon flux is consistent with fermi - lat data .",
    "a more sophisticated realization of our mechanism than in the fiducial model must also respect the icecube limits , and therefore the fermi - lat data as well .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section we discuss the impact of theoretical and experimental uncertainties on our model , as well as different choices for the fiducial parameters .      to study the influence of the experimental systematic uncertainties on our fit , we have repeated the fit for all combinations of altering the measurements by @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the quoted uncertainties on the energy and composition scale .",
    "we find that the best fit is obtained within the experimental systematics when shifting the energy scale up by @xmath78 and by shifting @xmath69 and @xmath79 corresponding to a shift of the shower maximum by @xmath80 .",
    "the best - fit values after the application of these shifts are shown in brackets in table  [ table : fiducial ] .",
    "most notably , the peak energy of the photon spectrum decreases from 110 to 70  and the best - fit value of the spectral index of the escape time decreases from @xmath81 to almost @xmath82 .",
    "the neutrino flux at earth obtained for this fit is about 30% smaller than in case of the fiducial model .",
    "this is mainly due to the difference in the best - fit peak energy of the photon field in the source environment .",
    "the sensitivity of the neutrino flux to @xmath43 will be further discussed in sec.[sec : modelvarphotonspec ] .    the overall description of the spectrum and composition",
    "is considerably improved , as can be seen in fig.[fig : fitsys ] .",
    "the model variations discussed below will therefore be performed based on shifted data .",
    "the interpretation of experimental air shower data in terms of mass composition relies on the validity of extrapolations of the properties of hadronic interactions to ultrahigh energies . using alternative models for this interpretation (  @xcite or  @xcite instead of",
    "@xcite ) , decreases the value of the @xmath83 data points by about @xmath84 and leads to a worse fit of the data .",
    "if this difference between models gives a fair estimate of the uncertainties of the mass determination in both directions , @xmath85 , then a hadronic interaction model that leads to a heavier interpretation of auger data than would make the fit with the fiducial model even better , similar to the systematic shift in the composition scale discussed in the previous section .",
    "+      it is remarkable that a good description of both the spectrum and mass composition at earth is possible by assuming only a single injected species at the source as assumed for simplicity in the fiducial model .",
    "however , depending on the astrophysical scenario , this might be an unrealistic assumption .    in fig.[fig :",
    "massscan ] we explore the capability of our model to incorporate additional flux components of mass @xmath86 below and above the mass @xmath87 that gives the best fit for the fiducial single - mass model .",
    "as can be seen , our calculation allows for an additional proton or helium component as large as 80% and up to 70% for nitrogen .    for an additional flux component with a heavy mass ,",
    "the model is more restrictive as illustrated in the lower left panel of fig.[fig : massscan ] using @xmath88 . in this case",
    ", the description of the data considerably deteriorates for fractions above 10% .",
    "the reason for this behavior is twofold .",
    "firstly , the injection of too much iron at the source leads to a too heavy composition at earth as compared to the estimates from the pierre auger observatory .",
    "secondly , if the end of the cosmic ray spectrum is to be described by the maximum rigidity of iron nuclei , then the energy of secondary nucleons needed to populate the flux at and below the ankle is too small to describe the data ( the maximum energy of secondary nucleons is @xmath11 of the maximum energy of nuclei ) .",
    "if the cut - off of the flux is at higher energies , as suggested by the measurement of ta  @xcite , then a larger fraction of iron primaries at the source can be incorporated , as shown in the lower right panel of fig.[fig : massscan ] .",
    "when using the ta data in the fit , as shown in fig.[fig : fitta ] , the spectrum can be described reasonably well even for an injected flux consisting of 100% iron nuclei .",
    "but in this scenario the composition at earth at ultrahigh energies is heavier than suggested by the interpretation of the @xmath89 data of auger .    as an illustration of a more complex composition model",
    ", we use the abundances of galactic nuclei at a nucleus energy of 1  , which we read from fig.28.1 in  @xcite .",
    "the flux fractions are 0.365 , 0.309 , 0.044 , 0.077 , 0.019 , 0.039 , 0.039 , 0.0096 , 0.014 , 0.084 for h , he , c , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar+ca , fe , respectively . the resulting fit is shown in fig.[fig : fitgalactic ] ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "this example demonstrates that our mechanism for producing the ankle is working even when considering a complicated mix of primaries .",
    "+      to have a concrete fiducial model , we needed to specify how the production of uhecrs varied over cosmological time scales .",
    "this is known as the source evolution , which we took to be in direct proportion to the star - formation - rate  as would be expected in a source scenario such as young magnetars .",
    "in this section , we consider alternative evolutions of the source luminosity density described by the simple one - parameter functional form @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 ranging from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 yields a uniform source luminosity distribution , @xmath98 corresponds to a strong evolution similar to the one of active galactic nuclei , and negative values result in sources that are most abundant or most luminous within the low - redshift universe as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are displayed in fig.[fig : gammafits ] for three choices of the spectral index @xmath99 of the injected flux : @xmath82 , as in the fiducial model , @xmath100 as expected for stochastic shock acceleration and for letting @xmath99 float freely in the fit . as can be seen in fig.[fig : gamma0 ] , @xmath101 gives a poor description of the data for @xmath102 , but is a viable choice for closeby sources , in accordance to the findings of  @xcite .",
    "for positive values of @xmath94 , a fixed value of @xmath103 gives a similar fit quality as the freely floating @xmath99 , but the latter converges to values larger than @xmath82 for source evolutions with @xmath104 ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : gamma2 ] ) .    for the `` traditional '' source evolutions with @xmath105 and the fit with @xmath103",
    "we find that most of the parameters exhibit only a minor variation with @xmath94 , with the exception of the power - law index of the escape time @xmath49 ( fig.[fig : gamma4 ] ) and the power density @xmath106 ( fig.[fig : gamma4 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that our model for the ankle does not critically depend on the choice of the source evolution , but that for a given choice of @xmath94 we can constrain the allowed values of @xmath99 , @xmath49 and @xmath106 .",
    "+      we repeated the model fits using alternative energy distributions of the photon density instead of the broken power law used in the fiducial model : a black body spectrum and two modified black body spectra .",
    "all four spectra are normalized to the same integral photon density and depend only on one parameter , the peak energy @xmath43 ( see appendix  [ app : appendixa ] ) .",
    "the resulting fit results are shown in fig.[fig : photonfits ] for a freely floating spectral index @xmath99 and for source evolutions with @xmath107 .",
    "as can be seen , all four photon spectra describe the data equally well ( fig.[fig : photon0 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit values of the free model parameters are very similar and in particular the obtained peak values are within @xmath108  .",
    "we conclude that as long as the photon spectrum is `` peaky '' , the particular details of its shape do not influence the parameters of our model .",
    "the sensitivity of the fit to the peak energy is shown in the left panel of fig.[fig : chi2andnu ] . as can be seen",
    ", the @xmath109 deteriorates very quickly at low values of @xmath43 , but it is almost flat above the minimum .",
    "this feature can be easily understood recalling @xmath43 in the `` l - curve '' approximation introduced in sec.[sec : ankle ] : the smaller @xmath43 , the larger is the energy of inflection of the interaction length , @xmath37 . for too - small values of @xmath43 ,",
    "the interaction and escape times are parallel over the full energy range and thus no high - pass filter is created . on the other hand , once @xmath37 is small enough , a further decrease changes only the flux at low energy , where the escaping spectrum is dominated by low - mass nuclei from spallation ( see e.g.  fig.[fig : tau&escspec ] ) which can be compensated by adjusting other parameters such as @xmath51 .",
    "+    to first order , our model can therefore only give a lower limit on the peak energy of the photon flux in the source environment .",
    "however , future limits or observations of neutrinos in the 10 - 100  range will help to constrain this important source property , because the number of predicted neutrinos strongly depends on @xmath43 , as shown in the left panel of fig.[fig : chi2andnu ] by the superimposed open symbols .",
    "a larger peak energy of the ambient photon environment increases neutrino production at the source in two ways .",
    "firstly , shifting @xmath37 to lower energies ( and compensating as necessary by adjustment of @xmath110 ) moves the interaction times of protons closer to the escape time and correspondingly additional neutrinos are produced via photo - pion production of protons ( compare e.g. the red curves at around @xmath111 in the upper panel of fig.[fig : tau&escspec ] ( @xmath112  ) to the ones in fig.[fig : tausys ] ( @xmath113  ) ) .",
    "secondly , increasing @xmath43 moves the minimum of the interaction time for photo - pion production of nuclei to lower energies .",
    "since the neutrinos from photo - pion production carry a larger fraction of the nucleon energy than the neutrinos from neutron decay after photo - dissociation , this increases the neutrino flux as well .",
    "it is tempting to give a quantitative interpretation of the @xmath114-curve of fig.[fig : chi2andnu ] in terms of a lower limit on @xmath43 and the number of neutrinos .",
    "however , the minimum of @xmath114 is far away from @xmath115 which  assuming this model is correct  is indicative of experimental systematics or an under - estimation of the experimental uncertainties or of deficiencies in the modeling of hadronic interactions in the atmosphere needed to interpret the data in terms of mass composition ( see above ) . in the absence of a concrete explanation",
    "we follow the pdg  @xcite and rescale the uncertainties by a common factor @xmath116 to bring the rescaled @xmath117 to 1 .",
    "this rescales the @xmath114 value of any given model so that the number of standard - deviations it is from the minimum is given by @xmath118 .",
    "this yields an approximate lower limit on @xmath43 at @xmath119 of @xmath120  and @xmath121 assuming the validity of the fixed fiducial parameters given in table  [ table : fiducial ] .",
    "the corresponding lower temperature limits are 180  k , 125  k and 100  k for the black body spectra with @xmath122 , 1 and 2 respectively",
    ". the lower limit on the neutrino spectrum is shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : chi2andnu ] .",
    "in addition to interactions with the background photon field , nucleons and nuclei can also scatter off hadrons in the source environment . in this paper",
    "we assume that the density of hadronic matter in the source environment is low enough that such hadronic interactions can be neglected . for any concrete astrophysical realization of our scenario",
    ", one must check and if necessary include hadronic interactions in the source environment .",
    "production of @xmath123 s and @xmath74 s in hadronic collisions could significantly increase the fluxes of neutrinos and photons emitted in the eev energy range .",
    "fast - spinning newborn neutron stars provide a particular example  @xcite .",
    "precise estimates of the impact of hadronic collisions on the predictions of our model will be presented in a separate publication .",
    "the results presented here are valid for all astrophysical systems in which the interactions are dominated by photo - nuclear processes .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new explanation for the ankle in the cosmic ray spectrum , and for the evolution with energy of the composition of extragalactic cosmic rays : from light below the ankle to increasingly heavy above .",
    "when nuclei are trapped in the turbulent magnetic field of the source environment , their escape time can decrease faster with increasing energy than does their interaction time . under these conditions",

    "the superposition of this steeply falling nucleon spectrum with the harder spectrum of the surviving nuclear fragments creates an ankle - like feature in the total source emission spectrum . above the ankle ,",
    "the spectrum emerging from the source environment exhibits a progressive transition to heavier nuclei , as the escape of non - interacting nuclei becomes efficient .",
    "abundant production of @xmath125 s is a signature of this mechanism .",
    "we illustrated the high quality of the fit which can be obtained to the auger data , with a fiducial model in which nuclei are accelerated up to a maximum rigidity found to be @xmath126 v , with spectrum @xmath127 , and are then subject to photo - disintegration in the vicinity of the accelerator before escaping for their journey to earth .",
    "we showed that the details of the photon spectrum around the accelerator are unimportant , except for its peak energy .",
    "the other important characteristic of the environment is the photon density relative to the magnetic diffusivity , which we characterized in a very simplistic way ( through a single parameter ) in this initial study .",
    "we studied the sensitivity of the mechanism to the energy - scale uncertainty and hadronic - interaction - modeling uncertainty , which affects the composition inferred from the atmospheric shower observations , and also used the ta spectrum instead of the auger spectrum .",
    "the conclusion of these studies is that a good quality fit can be obtained in most cases , but details of the fit parameters such as the composition and maximum energy characterizing the accelerator change .",
    "a corollary is that until these systematic uncertainties in the observations and their interpretation are reduced , such details of the accelerator can not be reliably inferred from the data .",
    "the fiducial model parameters needed in the fits are such that the scenario can be reasonably achieved in at least one type of proposed astrophysical source , as will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "our mechanism has two predictions beyond fitting the shape of the spectrum and composition evolution , which are independent of many environmental variables and can be used to test the validity of this scenario for production of the ankle .",
    "i ) the spectral cutoff of spallated nucleons emerging from the source environment is @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the rigidity cutoff of the accelerator , because @xmath130 while @xmath131 , and finally @xmath132 , largely independent of composition .",
    "this relation holds prior to the extragalactic propagation from the source , thus giving complementary information on the accelerator to that obtained from the spectrum and composition above the ankle alone .",
    "ii ) there is a one - to - one relation between the spectrum of spallated nucleons and the anti - electron - neutrinos produced by beta decay of neutrons , unless the spallated nucleons lose energy by interacting with hadronic material in the source environment .",
    "independent of other properties of the environment or the source evolution , @xmath125 s will have an identical spectral shape , shifted down by a factor @xmath133 from the kinematics of @xmath134 and reduced by a factor-2 in normalization because only half the nucleons are neutrons .",
    "this follows because propagation energy losses are small for nucleons of such low energy , and redshift impacts both nucleons and neutrinos identically .",
    "thus , detailed comparison of the @xmath125 and spallated nucleon spectra will reveal if hadronic interactions in the source environment are important , which would imply a correlated production of photo - pion produced neutrinos .",

    "this approach has been successfully applied to the photo - disintegration ( pd ) during the extra - galactic propagation of nuclei ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it can also serve as a good approximation for the losses due to photo - pion production ( pp ) if nuclei are treated as the superposition of @xmath12 individual nucleons ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction time is therefore the combination of the two processes , i.e. @xmath190    in this simplified propagation scheme , secondaries with mass @xmath12 and energy @xmath191 originate from nuclei with energy @xmath192 and mass @xmath193 .",

    "the propagation scheme described in the last section can be easily extended to take into account the emission of several nucleons or light nuclei in photo - nuclear reactions .",

    "the rest of the calculation proceeds as in the case of single - nucleon emission .",
    "once nucleons are generated in photo - disintegration they are assumed to either escape immediately in the case of neutrons , or to interact further via photo - pion production .",
    "the average elasticity of this process is @xmath204 and corresponds to a shift in energy of @xmath217 .",
