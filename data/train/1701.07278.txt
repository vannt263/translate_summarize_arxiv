    "he considered the zariski open subset @xmath45 of @xmath30 where no projective coordinate vanishes . for the number @xmath46 of all points in @xmath45 that are counted by @xmath37 he obtained the asymptotic formula @xmath47 with some positive @xmath48 .",

    "in particular , we see that spencer s @xmath48 coincides with the leading constant in theorem [ thm2 ] .",

    "one can express the height zeta function in terms of more general eisenstein series associated to non - trivial @xmath68-types ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but this leads to delicate convergence issues .",
    "it should be noted that the relation to the theory of eisenstein series plays a similar role , in much broader generality , in the important work of franke , manin and tschinkel @xcite .    despite its apparently more limited scope for the problem at hand ,",

    "this was carried out in our forthcoming article @xcite . in the present paper , variations of this circle of ideas",
    "are developed that provide more control on the error term featured in theorem [ thm2 ] .",
