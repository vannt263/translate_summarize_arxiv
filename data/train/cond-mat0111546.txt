    "in recent years much studies have been made for the stochastic resonance ( sr ) , in which weak input signals are enhanced by background noises @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this paradoxical sr phenomenon was first discovered in the context of climate dynamics , and it is now reported in many non - linear systems such as electric circuits , ring lasers , semiconductor devices and neurons .    for single neurons , sr has been studied by using various theoretical models such as the integrate - and - fire ( if ) model @xcite-@xcite , the fitzhough - nagumo ( fn ) model @xcite-@xcite and the hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) model @xcite . in these studies , a weak periodic",
    "( sinusoidal ) signal is applied to the neuron , and it has been reported that the peak height of the interspike - interval ( isi ) distribution @xcite-@xcite or the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of output signals @xcite-@xcite shows the maximum when the noise intensity is changed",
    ".    sr in coupled or ensemble neurons has been also investigated by using the if model @xcite-@xcite , fn model @xcite-@xcite and hh model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the transmission fidelity is examined by calculating various quantities : the peak - to - width ratio of output signals @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , the cross - correlation between input and output signals @xcite@xcite , snr @xcite@xcite@xcite , and the mutual information @xcite .",
    "one or some of these quantities has been shown to take a maximum as functions of the noise intensity and the coupling strength .",
    "collins , chow and imhoff @xcite have pointed out that sr of ensemble neurons is improved as the size of an ensemble is increased .",
    "some physiological experiments support sr in real , biological systems of crayfish @xcite@xcite , cricket @xcite and rat @xcite@xcite .",
    "sr studies mentioned above are motivated from the fact that peripheral sensory neurons play a role of transducers , receiving analog stimula and emitting spikes . in central neural systems , however , cortical neurons play a role of data - processors , receiving and transmitting spike trains . the possibility of sr in the spike transmission has been reported @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the response to periodic coherent spike - train inputs has been shown to be enhanced by an addition of weak spike - train noises whose interspike intervals ( isis ) have the poison or gamma distribution .",
    "it should be stressed that these theoretical studies on sr in neural systems have been performed mostly for stationary analog ( or spike - train ) signals although they are periodic or aperiodic @xcite .",
    "there has been few theoretical studies on sr for non - stationary signals .",
    "fakir @xcite has discussed sr for non - stationary analog inputs with finite duration by calculating the cross - correlation . by applying a single impulse , pei , wilkinson and moss @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that the spike - timing precision is improved by noises in an ensemble of 1000 hh neurons .",
    "one of the reason why sr study for stationary signals is dominant , is mainly due to the fact that the stationary signals can be easily analyzed by the fourier transformation ( ft ) with which , for example , the snr is evaluated from ft spectra of output signals .",
    "the ft requires that a signal to be examined is stationary , not giving the time evolution of the frequency pattern .",
    "actual biological signals are , however , not necessarily stationary .",
    "it has been reported that spike signals in cortical neurons are generally not stationary , rather they are transient signals or bursts @xcite , whereas periodic spikes are found in systems such as auditory systems of owl @xcite and the electrosensory system of electric fish @xcite .",
    "the limitation of the ft analysis can be partly resolved by using the short - time fourier transformation ( stft ) .",
    "assuming that the signal is quasi - stationary in the narrow time period , the ft is applied with time - evolving narrow windows .",
    "then stft yields the time evolution of the frequency spectrum .",
    "the stft , however , has a critical limitation violating the _ uncertainty principle _ , which asserts that if the window is too narrow , the frequency resolution will be poor",
    "whereas if the window is too wide , the time resolution will be less precise .",
    "this limitation becomes serious for signals with much transient components , like spike signals .",
    "the disadvantage of the stft is overcome in the wavelet transformation ( wt ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ft , the wt offers the two - dimensional expansion for a time - dependent signal with the scale and translation parameters which are interpreted physically as the inverse of frequency and time , respectively .",
    "as a basis of the wt , we employ the _ mother wavelet _ which is localized in both frequency and time domains .",
    "the wt expansion is carried out in terms of a family of wavelets which is made by dilation and translation of the mother wavelet .",
    "the time evolution of frequency pattern can be followed with an optimal time - frequency resolution .",
    "the wt appears to be an ideal tool for analyzing signals of a non - stationary nature . in recent years",
    "the wt has been applied to an analysis of biological signals @xcite , such as electoencephalographic ( eeg ) waves @xcite-@xcite , and spikes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "eeg is a reflection of the activity of ensembles of neurons producing oscillations . by using the wt",
    ", we can obtain the time - dependent decomposition of eeg signals to @xmath4 ( 0.3 - 3.5 hz ) , @xmath5 ( 3.5 - 7.5 hz ) , @xmath6 ( 7.5 - 12.5 hz ) , @xmath7 ( 12.5 - 30.0 hz ) and @xmath8 ( 30 - 70 hz ) components @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the wt is a powerful tool to the spike sorting in which coherent signals of a single target neuron are extracted from mixture of response signals @xcite-@xcite . quite recently",
    "hasegawa @xcite has made an analysis of transient spike - train signals of a hh neuron with the use of wt , calculating the energy distribution and shanon entropy .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the response of ensemble neurons to _ transient _ spike inputs in noisy environment by using the wt .",
    "there are several sources of noises : ( i ) cells in sensory neurons are exposed to noises arising from the outer world , ( ii ) ion channels of the membrane of neurons are known to be stochastic @xcite , ( iii ) the synaptic transmission yields noises originating from random fluctuations of the synaptic vesicle release rate @xcite , and ( iv ) synaptic inputs include leaked currents from neighboring neurons @xcite .",
    "most of existing studies on sr adopt the gaussian noises , taking account of the items ( i)-(iii ) . simulating the noise of the item ( iv ) ,",
    "refs.@xcite-@xcite include spike - train noises whose isis have the poisson or gamma distribution . in this study",
    "we take into account gaussian noises ; sr for spike - train inputs with added spike - train noises will be discussed in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "we assume an ensemble of hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) neurons to receive transient spike trains with independent gaussian noises .",
    "the hh neurons model is adopted because it is known to be the most realistic among theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the signal transmission is assessed by the cross - correlation between input and output signals and snr , which are expressed in terms of wt expansion coefficients . in calculating the snr",
    ", we adopt the denoising technique within the wt method @xcite-@xcite , by which the noise contribution is extracted from output signals .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "iia , an adopted model for an ensemble of @xmath0-unit hh neurons is described , and in sec .",
    "iib the wt is briefly discussed .",
    "we present the calculated results for @xmath9 pulse train in sec .",
    "iiia , and the results for spike trains with @xmath10 and 3 are discussed in sec.iib .",
    "the final sec .",
    "iv is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "we assume a network consisting of @xmath0-unit hh neurons which receive the same spike trains but independent gaussian white noises through excitatory synapses .",
    "spikes emitted by the ensemble neurons are collected by a summing neuron .",
    "a similar model was previously adopted by several authors studying sr for analog signals @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "an input signal in this paper is a transient spike train consisting of @xmath1 impulses ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "dynamics of the membrane potential @xmath11 of the hh neuron _",
    "i _ is described by the non - linear differential equations given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the capacity of the membrane . the first term @xmath14 of eq.(1 )",
    "denotes the ion current given by @xmath15 where the maximum values of conductivities of na and k channels and leakage are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ; the respective reversal potentials are @xmath19 mv , @xmath20 mv and @xmath21 mv .",
    "dynamics of the gating variables of na and k channels , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are described by the ordinary differential equations , whose details have been given elsewhere @xcite@xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath24 in eq.(1 ) denotes the postsynaptic current given by @xmath25 which is induced by an input spike with the magnitude @xmath26 given by @xmath27 with the alpha function @xmath28 : @xmath29 in eqs.(3)-(5 ) @xmath30 is the @xmath31-th firing time of the input , the heaviside function is defined by @xmath32 for @xmath33 and 0 for @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 stand for the conductance , reversal potential and time constant , respectively , of the synapse .",
    "the third term @xmath38 in eq.(1 ) denotes the gaussian noise given by @xmath39 @xmath40 where the overline @xmath41 and the bracket @xmath42 denote the temporal and spatial averages , respectively , and @xmath43 the intensity of white noises .",
    "the output spike of the neuron @xmath44 in an ensemble is given by @xmath45 in a similar form as an input spike [ eq.(4 ) ] , where @xmath46 is the @xmath47-th firing time when @xmath48 crosses @xmath49 mv from below .",
    "we should remark that our model given by eqs.(1)-(7 ) does not include couplings among ensemble neurons .",
    "this is in contrast with some works on ensemble neurons @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite where introduced couplings among neurons play an important role in sr besides noises , related discussion being given in sec .",
    "differential equations given by eqs.(1)-(7 ) are solved by the forth - order runge - kutta method by the integration time step of 0.01 ms with double precision .",
    "some results are examined by using the exponential method .",
    "the initial conditions for the variables are given by @xmath48= -65 mv , @xmath50=0.0526 , @xmath51=0.600 , @xmath52=0.313 at @xmath53 , which are the rest - state solution of a single hh neuron .",
    "hereafter time , voltage , conductance , current , and @xmath43 are expressed in units of ms , mv , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "we have adopted parameters of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "adopted values of @xmath35 , @xmath43 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 will be described shortly .",
    "there are two types of wts : one is the continuous wavelet transformation ( cwt ) and the other the discrete wavelet transformation ( dwt ) . in the former the parameters denoting the scale and trasnlation are continuous variables while in the latter they are discrete variables .",
    "the cwt for a given regular function @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 with a family of wavelets @xmath62 generated by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the _ mother wavelet _ , the star denotes the complex conjugate , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 express the scale change and translation , respectively , and they physically stand for the inverse of the frequency and the time .",
    "then the cwt transforms the time - dependent function @xmath60 into the frequency- and time - dependent function @xmath67 .",
    "the mother wavelet is a smooth function with good localization in both frequency and time spaces .",
    "a wavelet family given by eq.(10 ) plays a role of elementary function , representing the function @xmath60 as a superposition of wavelets @xmath62 .",
    "the _ inverse _ of the wavelet transformation may be given by @xmath68 when the mother wavelet satisfies the following two conditions :    \\(i ) the admissibility condition given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the fourier transformation of @xmath64 , and    \\(ii ) the zero mean of the mother wavelet : @xmath72    on the contrary , the dwt is defined for _ discrete _ values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 : integers ) as @xmath76 with @xmath77 the ortho - normal condition for the wavelet functions is given by @xmath78 which leads to the inverse dwt : @xmath79    in the multiresolution analysis ( mra ) of the dwt , we introduce a scaling function @xmath80 , which satisfies the recurrent relation with @xmath81 masking coefficients , @xmath82 , given by @xmath83 with the normalization condition for @xmath80 given by @xmath84 a family of wavelet functions is generated by @xmath85 the scaling and wavelet functions satisfy the ortho - normal relations : @xmath86 a set of masking coefficients @xmath87 is chosen so as to satisfy the conditions shown above .",
    "the simplest wavelet function for @xmath88 is the harr wavelet for which we get @xmath89 , and @xmath90 in the more sophisticated wavelets like the daubechies wavelet , an additional condition given by @xmath91 is imposed for the smoothness of the wavelet function .",
    "furthermore , in the coiflet wavelet , for example , a similar smoothing condition is imposed also for the scaling function as @xmath92    once wt coefficients are obtained , we can calculate various quantities such as auto- and cross - correlations and snr , as will be discussed shortly . in principle",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath93 in dwt may be calculated by using eqs.(15 ) and ( 16 ) for a given function @xmath60 and an adopted mother wavelet @xmath64 .",
    "this integration is , however , inconvenient , and in an actual fast wavelet transformation , the expansion coefficients are obtained by a matrix multiplication with the use of the iterative formulae given by the masking coefficients and expansion coefficients of the neighboring levels of indices , @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the wt over ft is that we can choose a proper mother wavelet among many mother wavelets , depending on a signal to be analyzed . among many candidates of mother wavelets ,",
    "we have adopted the coiflet with level 3 , compromising the accuracy and the computational effort .",
    "the wt has been performed by using the matlab wavelet tool box .",
    "firstly we discuss the case in which ensemble hh neurons receive a common single ( @xmath9 ) impulse . when input synaptic strength is small : @xmath96 , no neurons fire in the noise - free case , while it is sufficiently large ( @xmath97 ) neurons fire , where @xmath98 is the threshold value . for a while",

    "the @xmath9 input pulse is applied at @xmath101 ms , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . figure 1(b ) shows the time dependence of the postsynaptic current @xmath102 of the neuron @xmath103 with added noises of @xmath104 . because neurons receive noises for @xmath105 ms , the states of neurons when they receive input pulse are randomized @xcite .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows the time dependence of the membrane potential @xmath106 of the neuron 1 , which fires with a delay of about 6 ms .",
    "this delay is much larger than the conventional value of 2 - 3 ms for the supra - threshold inputs because the integration of marginal inputs at synapses needs a fairly a long period before firing @xcite .",
    "firings in ensemble 500 neurons for @xmath104 are depicted by raster in fig .",
    "we note that neurons fire not only by input pulses plus noises but also spuriously by noises only . when the noise intensity is increased to @xmath107 , spurious firings are much increased , as fig .",

    "both @xmath8 and snr show typical sr behavior irrespective of the value of @xmath1 , although a slight difference exists between the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath8 and snr : for larger @xmath1 , the former is larger but the latter is smaller at the moderate noise intensity of @xmath190 .",
    "when similar simulations are performed for different isi values of @xmath191 15 and 35 ms , we obtain results which are almost the same as that for @xmath191 25 ( not shown ) .",
    "this is because the output spikes for inputs with @xmath189 2 and 3 are superposition of an output spike for a @xmath9 input when the isi is larger than the refractory period of neurons .",
    "it has been controversial how neurons communicate information by action potentials or spikes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the one issue is whether information is encoded in the average firing rate of neurons ( _ rate code _ ) or in the precise firing times ( _ temporal code _ ) .",
    "since andrian @xcite first noted the relationship between neural firing rate and stimulus intensity , the rate - code model has been supported in many experiments of motor and sensory neurons . in the last several years , however , experimental evidences have been accumulated , indicating a use of the temporal code in neural systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "human visual systems , for example , have shown to classify patterns within 250 ms despite the fact that at least ten synaptic stages are involved from retina to the temporal brain @xcite .",
    "the transmission times between two successive stages of synaptic transmission are suggested to be no more than 10 ms on the average .",
    "this period is too short to allow rates to be determined accurately .",
    "although much of debates on the nature of the neural code has focused on the rate versus temporal codes , there is the other important issue to consider : information is encoded in the activity of single ( or very few ) neurons or that of a large number of neurons ( _ population _ or _",
    "ensemble code _ ) .",
    "the population rate code model assumes that information is coded in the relative firing rates of ensemble neurons , and has been adopted in the most of the theoretical analysis . on the contrary , in the population temporal code model",
    ", it is assumed that relative timings between spikes in ensemble neurons may be used as an encoding mechanism for perceptional processing @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a number of experimental data supporting this code have been reported in recent years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , data have demonstrated that temporally coordinated spikes can systematically signal sensory object feature , even in the absence of changes in firing rate of the spikes @xcite .",
    "our simulations based on the temporal - code model has shown that a population of neurons plays a very important role for the transmission of sub - threshold transient spike signals [ figs .",
    "8(a ) and 18(b ) ] .",
    "in particular for single neurons the transmission is quite unreliable and the appreciable sr effect is not realized .",
    "when the size of ensemble neurons is increased , the transmission fidelity is much improved in a fairly wide - range of parameters @xmath176 including both the sub- and supra - threshold cases ( fig .",
    "we note in figs .",
    "8(a ) and 8(b ) that @xmath8 ( or snr ) for @xmath192 is different from and larger than that for @xmath3 with 100 trials .",
    "this seems strange because a simulation for an ensemble of @xmath0 neurons is expected to be equivalent to simulations for a single neuron with @xmath0 trials , if there is no couplings among neurons as in our model .",
    "this is , however , not true , and it will be understood as follows .",
    "we consider a quantity of @xmath193 which is @xmath8 ( or snr ) averaged over @xmath194 trials for an ensemble of @xmath0 neurons .",
    "we implicitly express @xmath193 as @xmath195 with @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 stand for averages over trials and an ensemble neurons , respectively , defined by eq.(47 ) , @xmath199 is the @xmath47-th firing time of the neuron @xmath44 in the @xmath200-th trial , @xmath201 is its output signal of the neuron @xmath44 within a time bin of @xmath108 [ _ cf . _",
    "eq.(29 ) ] , and @xmath202 is a functional of a given function of @xmath203 relevant to a calculation of @xmath8 ( or snr )",
    ". figures 8(a ) and 8(b ) show that the relation : @xmath204 , namely @xmath205 holds for our @xmath8 and snr .",
    "note that if @xmath206 is linear , we get @xmath207 .",
    "this implies that the inequality given by eq .",
    "( 49 ) is expected to arise from a _ non - linear _ character of @xmath206 .",
    "this reminds us of the algebraic inequality : @xmath208 valid for a convex function @xmath209 , where the bracket @xmath198 stands for an average over a distribution of a variable @xmath210 .",
    "it should be again noted that there is no couplings among our neurons in the adopted model .",
    "then the enhancement of snr with increasing @xmath0 is only due to a population of neurons .",
    "this is quite different from the result of some papers @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite in which the transmission fidelity is enhanced not only by noises but also by introduced couplings among neurons in an ensemble .    in our simulations reported in sec .",
    "iii , independent noises are applied to ensemble neurons . if instead we try to apply the same or _",
    "completely correlated _ noise to them , it is equivalent to applying noises to a single neuron , and then appreciable sr effect is not realized as discussed above",
    ". then sr for transient spikes requires independent noises to be applied to a large - scale ensemble of neurons .",
    "this is consistent with the result of liu , hu and wang @xcite who discussed the effect of correlated noises on sr for stationary analog inputs .",
    "although spike trains with small values of @xmath2 have been examined in sec .",
    "iii , we can make an analysis of spikes with larger @xmath1 or bursts , by using our method . in order to demonstrate its feasibility",

    "the @xmath123 and @xmath126 components are dominant .",
    "after the denoising , we get @xmath212 and @xmath213=18.6 db , which are comparable to those for @xmath107 with @xmath2 shown in figs . 15(a ) and 15(b ) . in our denosiging method given by eqs.(39 ) and ( 45 ) , we extract noises outside the @xmath66 region relevant to a cluster of spikes , but do not take account of noises between pulses . when a number of pulses @xmath1 and/or the isi @xmath183 become larger , a contribution from noises between pulses become considerable , and it is necessary to modify the denoising method such as to extract noises between pulses , for example , as given by @xmath214 in eq .

    "however , the general behavior of the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath235 and @xmath236 is not changed .",
