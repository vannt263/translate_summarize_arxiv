    "many theoretical approaches beyond the standard model involve enhanced symmetries that introduce new charged vector currents carried by new heavy gauge bosons , usually called @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 boson can appear as kaluza - klein excitations of the @xmath4 boson in extra - spacetime dimension models @xcite , as massive right - handed counterpart of the @xmath4 boson in left - right symmetric models @xcite in order to restore the parity symmetry at high energy , or in little higgs models @xcite which provide mechanisms to cancel the quadratic divergences that appear in the higgs - boson mass calculation .",
    "in many of these theories , the @xmath0 boson is expected to couple more strongly to the 3@xmath5 generation of quarks than to the two first ones , opening channels potentially inaccessible to leptonic searches . a search for @xmath6 '' to describe both @xmath7 and @xmath8 processes .",

    "this search is performed in the semi - leptonic final state @xmath10 ( figure [ fig : signal_feynman_diagram ] ) , by requiring the presence of a prompt lepton ( electron or muon ) for a cleaner experimental signature and two @xmath1-jets in order to reduce the background .        in this context ,",
    "top - quark pairs ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath4+jets events are the main backgrounds .",
    "other smaller background processes consist of single top - quark production , diboson and @xmath12+jets events .",
    "an additional instrumental background stems from multijet production with a jet misidentified as a lepton .",
    "the multijet and @xmath4+jets backgrounds are determined with data - driven methods and all of the remaining background processes are modelled using simulation and scaled to their theoretical predictions . the @xmath0 boson is searched for in events with two or three jets , two of which are identified as @xmath1-jets ( 2-tag ) .",
    "the signal region used for the search is defined by selecting events where the reconstructed invariant - mass of the @xmath13 system `` @xmath14 '' is higher than 330 gev . after the event selection , a bdt algorithm is used to separate a potential @xmath0-boson signal from the background .",
    "four bdts are trained in the 2-jet 2-tag and 3-jet 2-tag channels using right - handed and left - handed @xmath0 bosons of mass 1.75 tev as signal and all of the background processes are weighted to their relative abundance .",
    "a set of a dozen of discriminating kinematical variables is used to build the bdts for each channel where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the two most discriminating variables . only variables which are well modelled in control regions",
