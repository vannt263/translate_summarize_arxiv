    "astrophysical reaction rates describe the change in abundances of nuclei due to nuclear processes in an astrophysical environment , such as a hot plasma composed of free electrons and atomic nuclei .",
    "the reaction rate per particle pair ( or reactivity ) is found by folding interaction cross sections @xmath3 with the appropriate energy distribution of the interacting particles in the plasma . for nucleons and nuclei interacting with each other in stars ,",
    "the latter is the maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution , leading to the definition of the reactivity @xmath4 with @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the boltzmann constant , @xmath7 the plasma temperature , and @xmath8 the reduced mass @xmath9 .",
    "although the integration limits run from zero to infinity , the largest contributions to the integral @xmath10 stem from a narrowly confined energy range , depending on the energy - dependence of the cross sections and the mb distribution .",
    "this relevant energy range has been termed the gamow window for charged particle reactions and is important for both nuclear experimentalists and theoreticians as it defines the energy window within which the reaction cross sections have to be known .",
    "due to their importance , simple approximation formulas ( see eqs.[eq : e0approx ] , [ eq : deltaapprox ] , [ eq : effneutron ] , [ eq : deltaneutron ] ) have been derived to estimate the effective energy windows for reactions ( see next sections ) and are frequently used .",
    "however , the derivations of these formulae make implicit assumptions which are not always valid and therefore they can not be applied to a number of important cases .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out @xcite that resonances below the conventionally computed gamow window may contribute significantly to the reaction rate for narrow - resonance capture of charged particles on light targets .",
    "it will be shown in the following that this can be understood by a more appropriate treatment of the gamow window calculation .",
    "the applicability of the approximation will be discussed in more detail and the appropriate energy windows derived quantitatively for charged - particle induced reactions ( sec .",

    "[ sec : reactions - with - neutrons ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes with a discussion of the validity of the present approach and a brief summary .",
    "the standard approximation of the gamow window assumes that the energy - dependence of the cross section @xmath3 is mainly determined by the projectile s penetration of the coulomb barrier .",
    "the integral @xmath10 can then be rewritten as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the astrophysical @xmath12 factor@xmath13 which is assumed to be only weakly dependent on the energy @xmath14 for non - resonant reactions .",
    "the second exponential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : penet ] ) contains an approximation of the coulomb penetration through the sommerfeld parameter @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the charges of projectile and target , respectively , and @xmath8 is the reduced mass . while the first exponential decreases with increasing energy , this second one increases , leading to a confined peak of the integrand , the so - called gamow peak . the location of the peak @xmath18 is shifted to higher energies with respect to the maximum of the mb distribution at @xmath19 . assuming a constant @xmath12 factor , @xmath18 can be determined analytically to be @xcite@xmath20 the peak is not symmetrical around @xmath18 but nevertheless is often approximated by a gaussian function@xmath21 where @xmath22 is the maximal value of the product of the two exponentials in eq .",

    "( [ eq : gamowenergy ] )  and hence of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e0approx ] ) , ( [ eq : deltaapprox ] )  implicitly assumes that the energy - dependence of the cross section @xmath3 is dominated by the coulomb barrier penetration of the projectile . in other words , the energy - dependence of the entrance channel width dominates .",
    "resonant cross sections can be written as a sum of breit - wigner terms .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that for a sufficiently high nuclear level density at the compound nucleus formation energy the sum of overlapping resonances can be replaced by a sum over averaged widths ( or averaged strength functions ) , leading to the well - established statistical model of compound reactions ( hauser - feshbach model ) .",
    "thus , both resonant and hauser - feshbach cross sections can be expressed as @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 being either breit - wigner widths or averaged hauser - feshbach widths , depending on the context .",
    "the width of the entrance channel is given by @xmath37 , the one of the exit channel by @xmath38 , and the total width including all possible emission channels from a given resonance or compound state with spin @xmath39 by @xmath40 even in the case of the statistical model only few summands in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) contribute although the sum runs over all values of @xmath41 .",
    "it has become common knowledge that a cross section of the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) is determined by the properties of the smaller width in the numerator if no other channels than the entrance and exit channel contribute significantly to @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath42 cancels with the larger width in the numerator and the smaller width remains .",
    "( the effect is less pronounced and requires more detailed investigation when other channels are non - negligible in @xmath42 . ) in consequence , the energy - dependence of the cross section will then be governed by the energy dependence of this smallest @xmath43 . only if this happens to be a charged - particle ( averaged ) width in the entrance channel , the use of the standard formula for the gamow window ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : e0approx ] , [ eq : deltaapprox ] ) will be justified .",
    "since @xmath44 and @xmath45 have different energy dependences , it will depend on the specific energy ( weighted by the mb distribution ) which of the widths is smaller .",
    "higher plasma temperature will select an energy range at higher energy .",
    "therefore , the relative sizes of the @xmath43 and thus the energy dependence of the cross sections in the relevant energy range will depend on the plasma temperature .",
    "this determines the gamow windows .",
    "it can be seen immediately that the prerequisite for applying the standard formula may not be met when studying reactions like ( p,@xmath1 ) at moderate reaction @xmath46 values where one would expect the @xmath1 width to be smaller than the proton width . also for charged particle",
    "capture the standard formula will be problematic as long as the @xmath0 width is smaller than the width in the entrance channel .",
    "although astrophysically relevant interaction energies are so small that charged particle widths often become smaller than the radiation widths due to the coulomb barrier , reactions in high temperature environments  such as explosive nucleosynthesis  may still exhibit the opposite relation .",
    "because of the sensitivity of the gamow window to the relative sizes of the widths and the complicated dependence of the widths on the interaction energy , gamow windows should be extracted from numerical inspection of the integrand in eq .  ( [ eq : integrand ] ) and not from the standard formula which is only applicable for a limited number of cases .",
    "this is performed in the following sections .",
    "the function @xmath47 was computed for all targets and reactions given in @xcite .",
    "the energies of the maxima @xmath30 and the widths @xmath48 of the peaks of @xmath49 were determined for each case .",
    "a full table of the results is available as a machine - readable file from epaps @xcite or at the author s website @xcite . with the exception of captures ,",
    "only reactions with positive reaction @xmath46 value are shown .",
    "the effective energy window of the reverse reaction can be found by shifting the energy window by the @xmath46 value . for captures also reactions with @xmath50",
    "are shown , similar to what is given in @xcite because to minimize stellar plasma effects due to thermal population of the target states it is always preferable to measure captures instead of photodisintegrations @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : truepeaks ] , shown here , is only an abbreviated table to illustrate the kind of information contained in the full table for a few selected examples .",
    "the full table contains the gamow windows of 20540 charged - particle reactions for temperatures @xmath51 gk , involving targets from proton- to neutron - dripline and with charge numbers @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that the definition of the width @xmath48 of the `` true '' gamow window used here differs from the definition of the width @xmath25 as used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaapprox ] ) .",
    "the width from the standard approximation is the @xmath52 width of the gaussian function .",
    "however , caution is advised whenever using the energy range defined in such a manner for , e.g. , deriving the energies at which experimental cross sections are to be determined . for the numerically derived `` true '' gamow windows of this work i found that the area of the peak limited by the @xmath52 width contains only @xmath53% of the total contribution to the integral , which would lead to a similar uncertainty in the reaction rate even when",
    "the cross sections within the window were experimentally completely determined . to obtain a better measure for the relevant energy range , for each case ( of given reaction on specific target at given temperature ) an energy range was numerically determined contributing 90% of the total integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : integrand ] ) .",
    "this is the width @xmath48 quoted in table [ tab : truepeaks ] and in the epaps table @xcite .",
    "the energy of the maximum at @xmath30 determines where the cross sections have the largest weight in the integral . in most cases , however , the relevant energy window is not symmetric around this energy . for a more accurate specification of the energy window ,",
    "i also give the energy @xmath54 of the upper end of the window in the tables .",
    "thus , the range of relevant energies is defined as @xmath55    in the following i present general observations and discuss selected cases of interest . for comparison to the standard approximation formula ,",
    "i define a shift @xmath32 relative to the location of the gamow peak energy @xmath18 as given by the standard approach .",
    "in general , at higher temperature and for increasing charge number the shifts @xmath56 will be larger .",
    "these main effects are moderated , however , by the involved interplay of different coulomb barriers in different channels and different reaction @xmath46 values leading to a more complicated energy dependence of the widths and thus also of the cross sections .",
    "since neutrons do not experience a coulomb barrier and neutron widths are larger than charged particle widths at low energies in most cases , the charge and temperature effects can be most clearly seen in ( p , n ) and ( @xmath1,n ) reactions ( figs.@xmath57[fig : pn ] , [ fig : an ] ) . in both types of reactions there are no or only small shifts at @xmath58 but large shifts at @xmath59 .",
    "the magnitude of the shifts is generally larger for the ( @xmath1,n ) reactions ( note the different scale of the figures ) due to the higher charge of the @xmath1 particle .",
    "the @xmath56 also increase with increasing target charge @xmath60 in both cases .",
    "the shifts are always to smaller energy because the energy dependence of the neutron widths selects an effective energy close to @xmath34 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : reactions - with - neutrons ] ) which is always below @xmath18 .",
    "charged - particle capture is important in a variety of astrophysical processes . as mentioned in sec.@xmath57[sub : criticism ] , for capture reactions the applicability of the standard approximation depends on the size of the @xmath0 width @xmath61 relative to the projectile width @xmath44 . when @xmath62 , one would assume that there is no gamow window as the energy dependence of the @xmath0 width does not show as strong an increase with increasing energy as a charged - particle width @xcite .",
    "however , effectively the gamow window is shifted only to much lower energy .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the integration limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integrand ] ) starts at zero energy and thus will always either include a region where @xmath63 and the coulomb penetration is competing with the decay of the mb distribution at larger energies , or the low - energy region of the mb distribution suppressing a weakly energy - dependent radiation width .",
    "both cases lead to a peak in the integrand @xmath49 although the `` peak '' may be located so that it closely approaches zero energy .",
    "figure [ fig : ag - vs - z ] shows a similar temperature dependence of the shifts for @xmath1 captures as for ( @xmath1,n ) , although the magnitude of the shifts is larger .",
    "these shifts are caused by the fact that at higher @xmath7 energy regions with @xmath64 receive a larger weight by the mb distribution .",
    "positive shifts appear for cases with @xmath50 , simply because the gamow energy @xmath18 derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0approx ] ) is below the ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) threshold and the actual energy window opens at higher energy .",
    "the situation is similar for ( p,@xmath0 ) reactions but the temperature dependence is not as pronounced .",
    "the positive shifts occur for proton - rich targets at the proton dripline , as can be seen in fig.@xmath57[fig : pg - vs - n ] , plotting the shifts versus the neutron number @xmath65 .",
    "the astrophysical importance of capture reactions warrants study for a few cases in more detail .",
    "as already pointed out @xcite , it was experimentally found that resonances below the gamow window , as defined by the standard approximation formulae , significantly contribute to the reaction rate for certain capture reactions , e.g. , @xmath66mg(@xmath1,@xmath0)@xmath67si and @xmath68al(p,@xmath0)@xmath67si .",
    "the results for these reactions are given in table [ tab : truepeaks ] .",
    "figure [ fig : comparison - mg - al ] shows a comparison of the actual integrands @xmath49 and the gaussian functions obtained by application of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e0approx ] ) , ( [ eq : deltaapprox ] ) .",
    "this can be directly compared to figure 3.24 of @xcite where the relative contributions of resonances are compared to the gamow window derived from the standard approximation ( for a brief discussion of the relevance of the gamow window for narrow resonances , see sec.@xmath57[sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "the present results show that the approximation is not valid and the actual gamow window is shifted to lower energy in agreement with what was found in @xcite but quantifying the relevant energy window .",
    "a similar case is @xmath69ca(@xmath1,@xmath0)@xmath70ti , where the effective energy window is also considerably shifted to lower energy .",
    "a plot comparing the actual integrand of the reaction rate with the gaussian approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "a further example is the reaction @xmath71tm(@xmath1,@xmath0)@xmath72lu , shown in fig.@xmath57[fig : tm169ag ] .",
    "again , the shift is considerable at a temperature reached in explosive nucleosynthesis . it is larger than the shifts for lighter targets because of the larger coulomb barrier .",
    "the increasing asymmetry of the peak with increasing temperature can also clearly be seen .",
    "finally , we might expect that reactions with charged particles in both channels show the most complicated dependence on temperature and charge .",
    "however , it is found that the obtained shifts are negligible at low temperature , which can be explained by the fact that the energy dependence of the entrance width dominates at low interaction energies .",
    "figure [ fig : ap ] shows that at @xmath73 similar values of the shifts are obtained in ( @xmath1,p ) reactions as in ( @xmath1,n ) reactions , smaller than for ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) .",
    "the shifts are also negligible at low temperature for ( p,@xmath1 ) reactions but larger and _ positive _ ( @xmath74 shifts are found at high temperature ( see fig.@xmath75 ) .",
    "this is because the proton widths quickly become larger than the @xmath1 widths at higher energies and this leads to a dominance of the @xmath1 width energy dependence .",
    "due to the higher coulomb barrier , the effective energy window is then found at higher energy as compared to the gamow window calculated for protons .",
    "this effect is shown in more detail in fig.@xmath57[fig : sn112pa ] for @xmath76sn(p,@xmath1)@xmath77 in at @xmath59 .",
    "neutrons are not subject to a coulomb barrier and therefore a gamow peak can not be defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : penet ] ) . nevertheless , an effective energy range can be found because @xmath78 usually is a slowly varying function which can be parameterized depending on the dominant partial wave , i.e. , @xmath79 for s - waves , @xmath80 for p - waves , and @xmath81 for d - waves .",
    "then the integrand @xmath49 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : integrand ] ) will exhibit a peak mainly determined by the peak of the mb distribution @xmath19 , only slightly shifted for partial waves @xmath82 due to the angular momentum barrier .",
    "an often used approximation is @xcite@xmath83 giving the effective energy window @xmath84 in mev for neutrons with energies less than the centrifugal barrier .",
    "this expression is not as handy as the one for the charged - particle gamow peak because the dominant partial wave is not known a priori .",
    "nevertheless , the shifts with partial wave are comparatively small and the assumption of s - waves is sufficient to define a useful energy window",
    ".    a straightforward application of eqs .  ( [ eq : effneutron ] ) , ( [ eq : deltaneutron ] ) will not be valid in all cases . just as it was the case with the approximation for charged projectiles in sec .",
    "[ sec : charged - particle - reactions ] , the derivation of the formula implicitly assumes that the energy dependence of the cross section is determined by the neutron projectile .",
    "this is justified for low - energy direct capture or reactions through wings of broad resonances . in the general resonant case ( and the case of averaging over a large number of resonances as performed in statistical model calculations ) , however , the energy dependence of the exit channel width can become important and strongly modify the effective energy window .",
    "similar to the reactions with charged projectiles discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : charged - particle - reactions ] , the actual effective energy windows were derived by calculating @xmath85 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : integrandfunction ] ) and numerically determining its maximum and the range of the main contributions to the rate integral ( eq .",
    "[ eq : integrand ] ) .",
    "neutron capture as well as ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath1 ) reactions are also included in the epaps table @xcite .",
    "just as for charged particle reactions only reactions with positive @xmath46 value are listed , except for ( n,@xmath0 ) reactions which also include a number of endothermic neutron captures at the dripline .",
    "this amounts to a total of 8862 neutron - induced reactions .",
    "table [ tab : truepeaks ] shows a few selected examples .",
    "the shifts @xmath31 given for neutron - induced reactions are relative to the peak of the mb distribution as this defines the location of the peak for neutron s - waves : @xmath33 .",
    "the effective energy window is again given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : defwindow ] ) .",
    "the shifts are zero or small for most neutron captures , except for those close to the neutron dripline .",
    "one would assume that this confirms the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : effneutron ] ) , ( [ eq : deltaneutron ] ) for ( n,@xmath0 ) reactions . however , it is rather due to the fact that the total @xmath0 widths , being smaller than the neutron widths in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) , have a comparatively weak energy dependence and do not move the maximum of the integrand @xmath49 from the one given by the mb distribution .",
    "this explains why all of the maxima @xmath30 are more or less identical to @xmath34 and thus also @xmath86 , with the @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "a different behavior is found only at low neutron separation energies where either @xmath0 widths show a stronger energy dependence or neutron widths become the smallest widths in the reaction channels . only in the latter case",
    "will different neutron partial waves be important in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effneutron ] ) .    despite the small absolute shifts for neutron captures ,",
    "it becomes apparent that the relevant energy window as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : defwindow ] ) reaches down to the reaction threshold if one desires to determine the reaction rate with high integration accuracy , even at high plasma temperature ( see also the examples in table [ tab : truepeaks ] ) .",
    "larger shifts are found for reactions with charged particles in the exit channel .",
    "contrary to most cases discussed in sec.@xmath57[sec : charged - particle - reactions ] , the shifts are positive for the majority of the neutron - induced reactions because the coulomb barrier penetration in the exit channel moves the energy window to higher energy .",
    "as expected , the shifts are larger for increased temperature , increased charge of the compound nucleus , and increased charge of the ejectile . figures [ fig : np ] and [ fig : na ] illustrate these dependences for ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath1 ) reactions .",
    "for @xmath89 the shifts are close to zero whereas they can reach several mev at @xmath90 the behavior within an isotopic chain is shown in fig.@xmath57[fig : sn - chain - na ] for ( n,@xmath1 ) on sn isotopes .",
    "again , for low temperature the effective energy window is barely shifted from the one predicted by the standard formula . with increasing temperature",
    "the shift becomes larger .",
    "the shifts for the neutron - rich nuclei are larger as the energy dependence of the @xmath1 width becomes stronger with decreasing @xmath46 value .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the preceding discussion made implicit assumptions which have to be scrutinized in any application of the results .",
    "an obvious assumption is that the cross sections used are correct .",
    "the results shown here were obtained with the frdm set given in @xcite .",
    "although transmission coefficients ( and thus widths ) are affected by low - lying nuclear states which can be populated in a reaction , the derived energy _",
    "windows _ should be robust because the gross energy dependence of the cross section is the relevant quantity and not its absolute value . at astrophysical temperatures",
    "the mb distribution always favors energies below the coulomb barrier .",
    "therefore , the energy dependence of charged - particle widths is dominated by the coulomb barrier penetration .",
    "since the energy dependences of widths in all channels may contribute , the energy windows are also sensitive to the reaction @xmath46 values .",
    "accordingly , updates to masses may affect the conclusions close to the driplines .",
    "this also holds for neutron capture reactions .",
    "although the selection of contributing partial waves strongly depends on the spectroscopy of a nucleus , the shape of the mb distribution is not strongly modified when folded with the energy dependence of any relevant partial wave , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : reactions - with - neutrons ] .",
    "therefore the relevant energy window for neutron capture is defined by the peak of the mb distribution .",
    "another source of concern may be the use of statistical model hauser - feshbach cross sections for nuclei with low level density close to the driplines , especially for rates at low plasma temperature .",
    "as explained above , the energy windows are mostly determined by the coulomb barrier penetration in the different channels or by the mb distribution .",
    "this will also hold for direct reactions . as explained below",
    ", the derived effective energy windows remain valid even when narrow resonances contribute and therefore this is not a limitation of the method .",
    "a final assumption seems to be that the cross sections are smooth without isolated resonance features .",
    "the notion of a single gamow peak loses its validity when narrow , isolated resonances are dominating the reaction rate . in this case , the gamow window would be fragmented into several gamow peaks of different importance , depending on the resonance strengths .",
    "it can be shown , nevertheless , that the notion of an effective energy window remains valid and that only resonances within the energy window contribute significantly to the reaction rate ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this applies provided the energy windows are derived as shown above .",
    "it does not make a statement about the relative importance of resonances because this depends on the actual resonance strengths , not just on the energy dependence of the widths .    summarizing , a complete numerical study of the effective energy windows for nuclear reaction rates has been performed for reactions induced by nucleons and @xmath1 particles .",
    "it has been shown that the actual energy range of relevant cross sections differs considerably from the ranges obtained by application of the standard formulae .",
    "the origin of this difference was explained and extensive tables of the actual energy windows were given .",
