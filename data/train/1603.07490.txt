    "regularization of inverse problems has been considered extensively and significant progress has been made ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "due to the demand of capturing special features of the reconstructed objects and the demand of dealing with general noise , regularization in banach spaces has emerged as a highly active research field and many new regularization methods have been proposed and investigated in recent years ; one may refer to @xcite and the references therein for recent developments .",
    "because of its simplicity and relatively small complexity per iteration , landweber iteration and its kaczmarz version have received extensive attention in inverse problem community @xcite . in recent years",

    "when solving ill - posed system of the form @xmath1 consisting of @xmath2 equations , a kaczmarz version of landweber iteration in banach spaces with general uniformly convex penalty functions has been proposed in @xcite which cyclically considers each equation in ( [ sys0 ] ) in a gauss - seidel manner . for these modern versions of landweber method , each iteration step essentially requires the computation of next iterate @xmath3 from current iterate @xmath4 via @xmath5 x_+ = \\arg \\displaystyle{\\min_x\\left\\ { \\theta(x ) -",

    "the existing convergence theory on landweber(-kaczmarz ) method in banach spaces requires the exact resolution of the minimization problem ( [ min0 ] ) .",
    "for some special @xmath12 its exact resolution is possible .",

    "furthermore , numerical simulations indicate that solving ( [ min0 ] ) very accurately in every step does not improve the final reconstruction result but wastes a huge amount of computational time .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to formulate a landweber - kaczmarz method with inexact inner solver in each iteration step and to develop the corresponding convergence theory .",
    "the inequality ( [ min1 ] ) suggests that the @xmath0-subdifferential calculus might be a useful tool for this purpose .",
