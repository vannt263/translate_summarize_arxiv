    "the prediction of a firm upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson is one of the most striking predictions of supersymmetric ( susy ) theories whose couplings stay in the perturbative regime up to a high energy scale .",
    "disentangling the structure of the higgs sector and establishing possible deviations from the standard model ( sm ) will be one of the main goals at the next generation of colliders .    in order to implement electroweak symmetry breaking consistently into the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "two higgs doublets are needed .",
    "this results in eight degrees of freedom , three of which are absorbed via the higgs mechanism to give masses to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bosons .",
    "the remaining five physical states are the neutral cp - even higgs bosons @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the neutral cp - odd state @xmath15 , and the two charged higgs bosons @xmath16 . at the lowest order , the higgs sector of the mssm",
    "is described by only two parameters in addition to the gauge couplings , conventionally chosen as @xmath1 and @xmath17 , where the latter is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the higgs - boson sector of the mssm is affected , however , by large radiative corrections which arise in particular from the top and scalar top sector and for large values of @xmath17 also from the bottom and scalar bottom sector .",
    "thus , the tree - level upper bound on the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs boson , @xmath18 in the mssm , arising from the gauge structure of the theory , receives large radiative corrections from the yukawa sector of the theory  @xcite . taking corrections up to two - loop order into account ,",
    "the mass is shifted by about 50% , establishing an upper bound of @xmath19  gev  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath20 linear collider ( lc ) will provide precision measurements of the properties of all higgs bosons that are within its kinematic reach  @xcite . provided that a higgs boson couples to the @xmath12  boson , the lc will observe it independently of its decay characteristics . at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , higgs boson detection can occur in various channels , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite . in many cases complementary information from more than one channel will be accessible at the lhc .",
    "in particular , the lhc has a high potential for detecting heavy higgs states which might be beyond the kinematic reach of the lc .",

    "this refers in particular to a precise knowledge of the top - quark mass , @xmath21 , from the lc  @xcite and information about the susy spectrum from both lhc and lc  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", two examples of a possible interplay between lhc and lc results in susy higgs physics  @xcite are investigated .",

    "in principle the phenomenology of the light cp - even higgs boson can be predicted on the basis of the experimental information on @xmath1 and @xmath17 .",
    "the lc , on the other hand , provides precise information on the branching ratios of the light higgs boson , which can be compared with the theory prediction . a realistic analysis",
    ", however , requires to take into account radiative corrections . in this way additional parameters become relevant for predicting the properties of the light cp - even higgs boson . comparing these predictions with experimental results on the light cp - even higgs boson provides a sensitive consistency test of the mssm at the quantum level .",
    "this allows in particular to obtain indirect information on the mixing in the scalar top sector , which is very important for fits of the susy lagrangian to ( prospective ) experimental data  @xcite .",
    "deviations between the indirect predictions and the experimental results may reveal physics beyond the mssm .    in section  [ sec : sps1a ]",
    "another scenario is analyzed where no heavy higgs bosons can be detected at lhc and lc . the combined information about the susy spectrum from the lhc and lc and of higgs - boson branching ratio measurements at the lc is used to obtain bounds on the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson , @xmath1 , in the unconstrained mssm ( for such analyses within msugra - like scenarios , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . since",
    "a realistic analysis requires the inclusion of radiative corrections , the achievable sensitivity to @xmath1 depends on the experimental precision of the additional input parameters and the theoretical uncertainties from unknown higher - order corrections .",
    "this means in particular that observed deviations in the properties of the light cp - even higgs boson compared to the sm case can not be attributed to the single parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we analyze in detail the impact of the experimental and theory errors on the precision of the @xmath1 determination .",
    "our analysis considerably differs from existing studies of higgs boson branching ratios in the literature  @xcite . in these previous analyses ,",
    "all parameters except for the one under investigation ( i.e.  @xmath1 ) have been kept fixed and the effect of an assumed deviation between the mssm and the sm has solely been attributed to this single free parameter .",
    "this would correspond to a situation with a complete knowledge of all susy parameters without any experimental or theoretical uncertainty , which obviously leads to an unrealistic enhancement of the sensitivity to the investigated parameter .",
    "section  4 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we analyze a scenario where experimental results at the lhc are used as input for confronting the predictions for the branching ratios of the light cp - even higgs boson with precision measurements at the lc .",
    "we consider the sps  1b benchmark scenario  @xcite , which is a ` typical ' msugra scenario with a relatively large value of @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , this scenario yields an @xmath1 value of about 550  gev , @xmath22 , and stop and sbottom masses in the range of 600800  gev .",
    "more details about the mass spectrum can be found in the appendix and in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume the following experimental information from the lhc and the lc :    * @xmath23 + this prospective accuracy on @xmath1 is rather conservative .",
    "the assumption about the experimental accuracy on @xmath1 is not crucial in the context of our analysis , however , since for @xmath24 the phenomenology of the light cp - even higgs boson depends only weakly on @xmath1 .",
    "* @xmath25 + the observation of heavy higgs states at the lhc in channels like @xmath26 will be possible in the mssm if @xmath17 is relatively large  @xcite .",
    "an attempted determination of @xmath17 from the comparison of the measured cross section with the theoretical prediction will suffer from sizable qcd uncertainties , from the experimental errors of the susy parameters entering the theoretical prediction , and from the experimental error of the measured cross section .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of heavy higgs states at the lhc will at least allow to establish a lower bound on @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath27 the lc will provide a precise determination from measurements in the chargino and neutralino sector .",
    "thus , assuming a lower bound of @xmath25 seems to be reasonable in the scenario we are analyzing .",
    "* @xmath28 + we assume that the lhc will measure the masses of the scalar top and bottom quarks with @xmath29 accuracy",
    ". this could be possible if precise measurements of parameters in the neutralino and chargino sector are available from the lc , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the measurements at the lhc ( combined with lc input ) will only loosely constrain the mixing angles in the scalar top and bottom sectors .",
    "therefore we have not made any assumption about their values , but have scanned over the whole possible parameter space ( taking into account the @xmath30  relation that connects the scalar top and bottom sector ) .",
    "it should be noted that for the prospective accuracy on the scalar top and bottom reconstruction at the lhc we have taken the results of studies at lower values of @xmath17 ( @xmath31 ) . while the stop reconstruction should not suffer from the higher @xmath17 value assumed in the present study , sbottom reconstruction is more involved , see ref .",
    "we assume that the reconstruction of hadronic @xmath32 s from the decay @xmath33 will be possible and the di - tau mass spectrum can be used for a mass measurement of the scalar bottom quarks at the 5% level .",
    "this still has to be verified by experimental simulation .",

    "@xmath34  gev + the top - quark mass ( according to an appropriate short - distance mass definition ) can be determined from lc measurements at the @xmath35 threshold with an accuracy of @xmath36  gev  @xcite .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the experimental error at the lhc , @xmath3712  gev , would induce a parametric uncertainty in the @xmath38 prediction of @xmath3912  gev . * @xmath40  gev + at the lc the mass of the light higgs boson can be measured with an accuracy of 50  mev ( whereas at the lhc a precision of 200300  mev seems to be feasible ) . in order to account for theoretical uncertainties from unknown higher - order corrections we assume an accuracy of @xmath40  gev in this study ( which dominates over the experimental resolution at the lhc and/or lc ) .",
    "this assumes that a considerable reduction of the present uncertainty of about 3  gev  @xcite will be achieved until the lc goes into operation .",
    "the experimental information from the heavy higgs and scalar quark sectors that we have assumed above can be used to predict the branching ratios of the light higgs boson . within the mssm",
    ", the knowledge of these experimental input quantities will significantly narrow down the possible values of the light higgs branching ratios .",
    "comparing this prediction with the precise measurements of the branching ratios carried out at the lc will provide a very sensitive consistency test of the mssm .",

    "the dark shaded ( dark blue ) region arises if furthermore a measurement of the light cp - even higgs mass of @xmath43  gev , including a theory uncertainty of @xmath40  gev , is assumed .",
    "the predictions are compared with the prospective experimental accuracies for br(@xmath44 ) and br(@xmath42 ) at the lc of about 2.5% and 5% , respectively  @xcite .",
    "agreement between the branching ratios measured at the lc and the theoretical prediction would constitute a highly non - trivial confirmation of the mssm at the quantum level . in order to understand the physical significance of the two dark - shaded regions in fig .",

    "on the other hand , is less critical in this respect , since the kinematic effect of the higgs mass in the prediction for the branching ratios is not affected by the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "[ fig : sec221plot ] shows that the lc measurements of the branching ratios of the light cp - even higgs boson allow to discriminate between the two dark - shaded regions . from the discussion above",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
