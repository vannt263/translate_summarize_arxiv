    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) are consisted of a set of cheap and usually battery - powered devices , called sensors .",
    "sensor limited power usually necessitates a compromise between lifetime and other parameters such as the data rate or the quality of the received signal in the sink .",
    "it is usually impracticable to replace the sensors batteries after their operation period .",
    "hence , estimating the network lifetime according to the initial energy in sensors is essential for network design . according to such lifetime estimation , one can choose the network parameters such as node density , data rate and initial energy of the sensors to achieve the desired lifetime .",
    "lifetime analysis has been studied in the literature based on different definitions such as the number of dead nodes in the network , network coverage and network connectivity@xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite derive an upper bound on the network lifetime considering the spatial behavior of the data source . to achieve this goal",
    ", they first consider a simplified version where the data source is a specific point , and the source is connected to the sink with a straight line consisting of relaying sensors .",
    "they derive the optimum length of a hop and consequently the number of hops in the path to minimize the total energy consumed for the data delivery .",
    "then , they remove the assumption of a source concentrated on a point and assume that the source is distributed over an area .    in @xcite ,",
    "the results of @xcite are extended to the networks whose nodes may perform different tasks of sensing , relaying and aggregating . the results of @xcite are also extended to multiple - sink networks in @xcite .",
    "work reported in @xcite studies the network lifetime for a cell based network .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath0 nodes are deployed over a hypercube .",
    "for the aim of energy conserving , the area is divided to @xmath1 hypercubes ( cells ) .",
    "using occupancy theory @xcite , the distribution of the minimum number of sensors within each cell is investigated when @xmath2 .",
    "then , authors study the lifetime for the case when network remains almost surely connected . using the number of sensors in each cell ,",
    "the network lifetime is lower bounded based on the given lifetime of each sensor .",
    "a lifetime study based on the area coverage is presented in @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the nodes have a circular sensing region and are distributed over a squared area . using the stochastic geometry , theory of coverage process , and assuming the size of the area goes to infinity , an expression for the node density is derived to guarantee a @xmath3-coverage in the area .",
    "it is shown that using the proposed density , the network lifetime is upper bounded by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the given lifetime of each sensor .",
    "although the upper bound is derived for an asymptotic situation when the area goes to infinity , it is shown through simulation that the derived bound is also reasonable for networks over a finite area .",
    "authors in @xcite divide linear or circular networks to some bins where each bin contains a deterministically assigned number of nodes .",
    "the nodes within each bin , however , are deployed randomly . also , the lifetime is defined as the time when a hole occurs in the routing scheme ( i.e. death of a bin ) . assuming a fixed transmission power for each packet and using the theory of stochastic processes , authors have found the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the network lifetime .",
    "in addition , they propose a method to assign the number of nodes within each bin in order to maximize the network lifetime .",
    "it is worthy to note that other studies in the literature are performed on the lifetime , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the most related ones to this work are those that we discussed earlier .    in this paper",
    ", we find the probability of reaching a certain lifetime for randomly distributed networks based on the power dissipation model of the sensors .",
    "more specifically , unlike @xcite , we do not assume that the lifetime of a sensor is given in order to find the network lifetime .",
    "instead , we find the lifetime of a sensor ( as a random variable ) based on its power dissipation and packet generation model .",
    "also , our analysis does not assume an infinite area and infinite number of sensors .",
    "in comparison to @xcite , we consider totally randomly deployed networks over more variant area shapes .",
    "in addition , both fixed and adjustable transmission power are studied in this work .",
    "also , the definition of lifetime in our work is more general and can include the case studied in @xcite ( to be discussed in section [ section lifetime pdf multi - hop ] ) .",
    "considering the randomness in packet generation and sensor deployment in the area , the lifetime of a network is a random variable . for a lifetime analysis of the network",
    ", it is needed to have a knowledge of the lifetime of each individual sensor . in this work , instead of assuming that the lifetime of each sensor is given beforehand , we first perform a lifetime analysis at the sensor level . to this end",
    ", we model the lifetime of a sensor as a random variable and find its distribution based on the traffic model and the power dissipation model in the sensor . using this probabilistic model of a sensor lifetime and the distribution of the sensors over the area ,",
    "the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) of the lifetime of a single - hop network is derived . from this ccdf , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the lifetime",
    "is also obtained",
    ". the single - hop analysis will be the base of our further extensions .    in the proposed analysis ,",
    "no asymptotic assumption is made on the number of nodes .",
    "nevertheless , an asymptotic analysis is provided , which  with an error exponentially decaying with the number of sensors  predicts whether or not a desired lifetime can be achieved .",
    "the above analysis is then extended to multi - hop networks . since the lifetime of the multi - hop networks is dependent on the routing scheme ,",
    "we study the lifetime ccdf under the _ maximum - lifetime _",
    "@xcite routing .",
    "the methodologies of this work are applicable to more general scenarios , some of them are discussed in this paper .",
    "for example , we extend the results to different traffic models ; to the case where different sensors may have different initial energy or traffic load ; and to various area shapes .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ section model ]",
    "we introduce the system model and provide the required definitions and assumptions . the lifetime analysis for single - hop networks",
    "is studied in section [ section prob model single hop ] .",
    "section [ section lifetime pdf multi - hop ] discuses the lifetime analysis of multi - hop networks .",
    "extensions to other scenarios are discussed in section [ section extnesion ] and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified through simulations in section [ section simulations ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ section conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , the components of the system model such as lifetime definition , energy consumption model and network traffic model are introduced .      as mentioned",
    ", lifetime has a great significance in the design of wsns .",
    "conceptually , lifetime means the time duration that the network is operational and can perform its assigned task .",
    "since there is no unique measure of the network failure , the definition of the lifetime is application - related .    in @xcite lifetime",
    "is stated as the time when the first node dies .",
    "usually the remaining sensors in the network can accomplish the network s assigned task .",
    "therefore , another definition based on the ratio of dead nodes to the total number of nodes in the network is often used ( e.g. @xcite ) . notice that this definition includes the definition of lifetime based on the death of the first node and therefore is more general .",
    "other definitions based on the communication connectivity or the coverage of the area are also proposed for the lifetime @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we consider the network lifetime based on the ratio of dead nodes to the total number of nodes , @xmath6 . for multi - hop networks , where the nodes close to the sink have more traffic load than other nodes and die sooner , we will modify this definition .",
    "the network lifetime is directly related to the sensors lifetime and in other words the energy dissipated in the sensor nodes .",
    "the consumed energy in sensors includes the energy required for sensing , receiving , transmitting and processing of data .",
    "the total consumed energy is usually dominated by the required energy for data transmission .",
    "two cases may be considered for the transmission mode of the nodes in the network . in the first case ,",
    "nodes transmit with a fixed transmission power .",
    "this usually results in a fixed transmission range . in the second case ,",
    "nodes use a mechanism to adjust their transmission power based on their distance to the next hop or the sink .",
    "hence , the required energy for a packet transmission in sensor @xmath7 can be modeled as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the packet length in bits , @xmath10 denotes the distance between sensor @xmath7 and the next hop , @xmath11 represents the path loss exponent , @xmath12 shows the loss coefficient related to 1 bit transmission and @xmath13 is the overhead energy due to the sensing , receiving and processing for the same amount of data .",
    "also , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the loss coefficient and the overhead energy for a packet transmission respectively .",
    "the path loss exponent depends on the local terrain and is determined by empirical measurements .",
    "the typical value of @xmath11 for wsns is from @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xcite .    while this work is more focused on the transmission model ( [ power dissipation model ] ) , fixed transmission power",
    "is also discussed .",
    "the traffic model of the network depends on the network application and the behavior of sensed events .",
    "the data reporting process in wsns is usually classified into three categories : event - driven , time - driven and query - driven @xcite . in the time - driven case , sensors send their data periodically to the sink .",
    "event - driven networks are used when it is desired to inform the data sink about the occurrence of an event . in query - driven networks , sink sends a request of data gathering when needed . in this paper , our main focus will be on the event - driven networks with poisson model for packet generation .",
    "suppose that the events are independent ( both temporally and spatially ) and occur with equal probability over the area . in this case , poisson distribution can be used effectively to model the generation of data packets @xcite . when the average rate of packet generation , @xmath18 , is known , the distribution of the number of data packets , @xmath19 , generated by each node , from time 0 to @xmath5 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a nonnegative integer number .",
    "since the packet generation distribution obeys the poisson model , the time duration between two consequent packet transmissions , @xmath22 , has an exponential distribution with mean @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the unit step function .    we will consider the poisson model for sensor s traffic in this study",
    "however , the proposed method can be extended to other traffic distributions and data gathering scenarios .",
    "in this section , we derive the pdf of the lifetime in single - hop wsns . assuming that nodes directly communicate with the sink",
    ", we first derive the ccdf of the lifetime .",
    "then , the pdf of the lifetime is obtained by taking the derivative of the ccdf .",
    "the results are extended to the case of multi - hop networks in section [ section lifetime pdf multi - hop ] .",
    "it is assumed here that all of the nodes have the same initial energy , same distribution over the area and the same packet generation model .",
    "other cases like nonuniform energy distribution or different packet generation models are studied in section [ section extnesion ] .    for the ease of presentation ,",
    "the list of parameters is provided in table [ parameters ] .",
    "as mentioned , the lifetime of a single - hop wsn is considered as the time when the ratio of dead nodes to the total number of nodes , @xmath0 , passes a threshold , @xmath6 .",
    ".parameters of the problem [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we start the network lifetime analysis by considering the lifetime of one sensor . defining @xmath26 as @xmath27 for sensor @xmath7 ,",
    "it is clear that the maximum number of packets that can be transmitted by this sensor is equal to @xmath28 .",

    "it is worthy to note that since the node is deployed randomly in the area , the distance between the node and the sink and consequently @xmath26 are a random variables .",

    "then we have @xmath97 which results in ( [ lifetime pdf ] ) . @xmath45",
    "in multi - hop networks , the network lifetime depends on the way that the routing scheme distributes the traffic load among the sensor nodes . the minimum cost routing ( minimum required energy or minimum number of hops ) is conventionally used in wireless networks .",

    ", the whole network traffic passes through the nodes in the vicinity of the sink , hence , death of these nodes can have a significant effect on the network performance .",
    "therefore , we need to modify our previous definition of the lifetime .",
    "assume that @xmath98 shows the set of nodes that are in the vicinity of the sink and directly communicate with it .",
    "since all other nodes communicate to the sink through these nodes , they will be out of energy sooner than the other ones .",
    "so , we define the lifetime based on the ratio of dead nodes within @xmath99 to @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the cardinality of the set . it is also assumed that the sensors are distributed over a circle with radius @xmath102 and the data sink is positioned at the center of the area .",
    "the lifetime of the network over other area shapes will be discussed later .",
    "we assume that the sensors perform transmission with a fixed power which results in a fixed transmission range @xmath49 .",
    "based on the maximum transmission radius of the sensors and the area radius , the area can be divided to a number of rings ( figure [ fig tx rings ] ) .",

    "this assumption allows us to focus on methodologies and can be removed if necessary .",
    "in addition , since each ring carries the traffic of all outer rings , the average traffic carried by the sensors within each ring is different and depends on the distance of the ring to the sink . to study the network lifetime",
    ", we consider the case when the routing scheme distributes the network traffic equally between the nodes within each ring .",
    "this scheme prevents the nodes from being exhausted quickly and prolongs the lifetime .",
    "based on the assumed routing scheme , the average rate of the packet transmission by each node within ring @xmath7 is equal to @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the number of sensors within ring @xmath7 .",
    "since nodes are assumed to be deployed randomly in the area , @xmath106 is a binomial random variable .",
    "if one assumes a uniform deployment for the nodes , @xmath106 will have a binomial distribution with mean @xmath107 where @xmath108 represents the probability of positioning a sensor in the ring @xmath7 .",

    "nevertheless , the probability of achieving @xmath31 by other rings can also be investigated using ( [ exponential model for rings ] ) . as discussed earlier , probability of achieving a lifetime threshold",

    "for @xmath152 , which we use in our simulations , the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively 0.0013 pj / bit/@xmath153 and 50 nj / bit for a 1mbps data stream . here , it is assumed that the packets have 1000 bits length , hence , @xmath1541.3 pj/@xmath153 and @xmath15550 @xmath93j in ( [ power dissipation model ] ) .",
    "network has 500 nodes that are deployed uniformly and sink is positioned at the center of the area .",
    "also , the packet generation model obeys the poisson distribution and each sensor sends its packets directly to the sink .",
    "all of the sensors have the same initial energy equal to 11 mj . assuming that sensors send packet with the average rate of 1 packet / hour , the probability of achieving the lifetime of 100 hours is studied through simulation .    to investigate the effect of the area shape on the lifetime ,",
    "the simulations are carried out over areas with the same size equal to @xmath156 but with different shapes . to decrease the final result variance and reach the proper confidence interval , the simulation is run 10000 times over each area and the results are averaged .",
    "figure [ beta diff area shapes ] depicts the probability of achieving the lifetime threshold vs. the ratio of dead nodes over circular , hexagonal , squared and triangular areas .",
    "as it can be seen , the probability of achieving the lifetime threshold in circular , hexagonal and squared areas are very close .",
    "since in a triangle , the distance of the sensors to the sink is more non - uniform and it has the largest circumcircle compared to other area shapes , triangle has a smaller probability to achieve the lifetime threshold .        as discussed through the paper , depending on the value of @xmath157 and by increasing the number of nodes",
    ", it can be almost surely determined whether the network achieves a lifetime threshold or not .",
    "the effect of the node density on achieving the lifetime threshold is shown in figure [ fig node density effect ] .",
    "the lifetime of the network is considered as the moment when 0.3 of the nodes in the network die . in the first case , @xmath158 mj which results in @xmath159 .",
    "hence , as discussed in section [ section extnesion ] , the desired probability decreases by increasing @xmath0 which is verified by the simulation . in the second case ,",
    "the initial energy is equal to 11.6 mj which causes @xmath160 . as shown in figure [ fig node density effect ] , the probability of achieving the desired lifetime is an increasing function of @xmath0 .          to study the network lifetime in a multi - hop network",
    ", it is assumed that 500 nodes are deployed uniformly over a circle with radius 100 m. all of the nodes have the same initial energy equal to @xmath161 mj .",
    "the parameters in ( [ power dissipation model ] ) are kept the same as the previous part .",
    "a greedy routing algorithm is used to balance the network traffic such that data packets are identically distributed between the nodes in the first ring of the network , @xmath99 .",
    "considering this fact that all of the nodes use a constant transmission power and the traffic is distributed identically between the first - ring nodes , all of the nodes within @xmath99 have approximately similar lifetime . as a consequence ,",
    "they die in time moments very close to each other .",
    "therefore , we can say that the desired probability is not significantly effected by the value of @xmath6 ( figure [ fig beta multihop ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to study the effect of the transmission range and consequently the number of hops on the lifetime .",
    "figure [ fig multihop tx range ] depicts the probability of reaching the lifetime threshold vs. the transmission range .",
    "the lifetime is considered as the moment when 0.3 nodes within @xmath99 are dead . by decreasing @xmath49 , number of nodes within @xmath99 decreases , hence ,",
    "they carry more packets and will die earlier .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the desired probability decreases by reducing @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , while the nodes far from the sink still have enough energy to send packets , the nodes within @xmath99 cease . to overcome this drawback ,",
    "nonuniform energy distribution can be applied @xcite .",
    "also , the fixed transmission power causes the nodes within @xmath99 to die sooner compared to the case where nodes adjust their transmission power .",
    "in this paper , we considered the problem of finding the probability of achieving a lifetime threshold by the network which is equivalent to finding the ccdf of the network lifetime . using the power consumption model of ( [ power dissipation model ] ) ,",
    "the ccdf of the lifetime was derived for the single - hop networks . to this end",
    ", it was assumed that all of the nodes have identical packet generation model , initial energy and random deployment in the area .",
    "the methodology was also extended to the case when these conditions may not be satisfied .",
    "then , the problem was studied for the multi - hop case .",
    "in addition , the asymptotic relation between the number of nodes and the lifetime was investigated . through some simulations ,",
    "the accuracy of our analysis was investigated for the networks deployed over different area shapes . using the proposed method",
    ", one can design both node and network parameters ( e.g. node density , data rate , initial energy ) according to the desired lifetime .",
    "the pdf of the network lifetime depends on the distribution of the maximum possible number of packet transmissions by each node , @xmath132 . in this appendix , we find the pdf of @xmath132 over some common area shapes .",
    "the pdf of @xmath132 over a circle area is required for finding the lifetime pdf of multi - hop networks in section [ section lifetime pdf multi - hop ] . also , this pdf over regular polygons is useful for studying the lifetime of a network composed of clusters tiling the area .",
    "assume that the nodes are deployed uniformly over a circle with radius @xmath102 .",
    "also , assume that the sink is located at the center of the circle .",
    "since the nodes are deployed uniformly over the area , the pdf of the distance between the nodes and sink , @xmath162 , is @xmath163 now , using the energy consumption model ( [ power dissipation model ] ) , we have the following expression for the pdf of @xmath132 @xmath164^{\\frac{2-\\alpha}{\\alpha}}&\\frac{e_i}{kr^{\\alpha } + c}\\leq x < \\frac{e_i}{c}\\\\ 0 & \\text{\\small{otherwise } } \\end{array}. \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      suppose that the sensors are deployed over a regular polygon having @xmath1 equal sides with length @xmath165 .",
    "again , we assume that the sink is placed at the center of the area . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the radius of the inscribed circle of the polygon , @xmath168 represents the radius of the circumcircle of the polygon and @xmath169 denotes the polygon area .",
    "now , using the relation between @xmath162 and @xmath132 , we have @xmath170^{\\frac{2-\\alpha}{\\alpha } } \\left[\\pi - n \\cos^{-1}{\\frac{r}{\\left ( \\frac{e_i - cx}{kx}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha } } } } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath171 and @xmath172^{\\frac{2-\\alpha}{\\alpha}}\\ ] ] when @xmath173 and @xmath174 elsewhere .",
