    "hera is the first and up to now the only electron - proton collider .",
    "it operates at a total center - of - mass energy @xmath0 , enabling besides @xmath1-exchange a large fraction of z and w exchange .",
    "thus hera is a truly electroweak collider allowing to study weak interaction effects in the spacelike region .",
    "the data are collected by the two collider experiments , h1 and zeus .",
    "inclusive electron - proton scattering can be conveniently characterized by three invariant variables , the photon virtuality q@xmath2 , bjorken - x , and inelasticity y. at fixed center - of - mass energy only two of these are independent , as q@xmath2=sxy .",
    "there are two distinct types of interactions observed at hera . in the case of neutral current ( nc ) scattering , either a @xmath1 or z - boson",
    "is exchanged .",
    "experimentally such processes are characterized by a scattered electron and a hadronic jet ( or jets ) observed in a detector , balanced in transverse momentum .",
    "the nc cross section can be written in the following form : @xmath3 , y_{\\pm } = 1 \\pm \\left ( 1-y \\right ) ^2\\ ] ] here the unknown proton structure is expressed in terms of three generalized structure functions .",
    "the dominant contribution to the cross section is provided by @xmath4 ; in the quark - parton model ( qpm ) it is equal to the sum of parton density functions ( pdfs ) of quarks and antiquarks weighted by their charges squared .    at large momentum transfers",
    "@xmath5 becomes sizable , in qpm it is proportional to the sum of pdfs of valence quarks weighted by their charges squared .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath6 is visible only at high y and can be neglected in this article .    in the case of",
    "charged current ( cc ) scattering a w boson is exchanged and the electron is transformed to a neutrino .",
    "such events are experimentally characterized by a hadronic jet ( or jets ) with missing transverse momentum . expressing the structure of the proton in terms of the functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the cc cross section can be parametrized as : @xmath10 ^ 2 \\left [ y_+ w_2 \\mp",
    "y_- x w_3 - y^2 w_l   \\right ] \\label{eq : cc1}\\ ] ] here m@xmath11 is the mass of the exchanged boson occuring in the propagator .",
    "for nc and cc ( left ) and for @xmath12 nc ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   for nc and cc ( left ) and for @xmath12 nc ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the nc and cc differential cross sections as a function of q@xmath2 are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] left .",
    "while they differ by several orders of magnitude at low q@xmath2 , due to different propagator terms , at q@xmath2 close to the w - mass squared they are of similar magnitude .",
    "the remaining differences are caused mainly by the fact , that nc and cc are sensitive to different combinations of pdf s .    on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] right one can see the differential nc cross section as a function of q@xmath2 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 collisions . at high",
    "q@xmath2 the dependence on the lepton beam charge is visible .",
    "this effect is described by @xmath5 , its main contribution at hera energies being the @xmath1z interference .",
    "starting in 2000 , the hera collider was upgraded to deliver higher luminosities and longitudinally polarized lepton beams .",
    "the transverse polarization in the hera electron ring builds up naturally via emision of synchrotron radiation ( sokolov - ternov effect ) .",
    "spin rotators flip the transverse polarization to longitudinal just before the interaction regions and vice versa behind it .",
    "the level of longitudinal polarization achieved up to now is 30 - 40 % .",
    "the longitudinal polarization has a particularly strong effect on charged current cross sections . in the standard model ( sm ) only left handed particles ( right handed antiparticles ) interact via cc .",
    "thus , defining the level of polarization as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are numbers of left handed ( right handed ) leptons in the beam , a linear dependence of the cross section on @xmath18 , giving zero cross section at @xmath19 for electron ( positron ) beam is expected .",
    "indeed , the total cc cross section as a function of @xmath18 , integrated over the visible phase space indicated on fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] left , is in good agreement with the sm prediction .",
    "a contribution of a right - handed cc should change the slope and the intercept of the linear dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath18 .",
    "the cross sections were fitted by straight lines and extrapolated to @xmath19 for electron ( positron ) beam .",
    "the h1 collaboration has presented data , for the visible phase space q@xmath2 > 400 gev@xmath2 and y < 0.9 , leading to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the zeus collaboration has shown results , for the visible phase space q@xmath2 > 200 gev@xmath2 leading to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "all results are compatible with zero , as predicted by the sm . for nc scattering ,",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 depend on the polarization due to pure z exchange and @xmath1-z interference : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ratio of two propagators , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are vector and axial couplings of z to electron . at hera energies ,",
    "the contributions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are suppressed by the propagator . as @xmath33 , to first order @xmath34 and therefore one expects the polarization asymmetry to be of similar size but opposite sign for @xmath13 and @xmath14 interactions .",
    "this is indeed observed in the ratio of nc cross sections , taken with two slightly different polarizations , for @xmath13 and @xmath14 as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] right .",
    "good statistical precision and wide phase space coverage of hera data allow one to perform a combined analysis , where the qcd and electroweak parameters are determined simultaneously from a fit to the data .",
    "the h1 analysis made use of hera i unpolarized data , the preliminary zeus analysis included hera ii data .",
    "the nc data are sensitive to the vector and axial coupling of light quarks to the z - boson . in the qpm",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be expressed as : @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the quark electric charge .",
    "using ep data , it is possible to determine both axial and vector couplings simultaneously , as contributions from z - exchange and the @xmath1z - interference have different q@xmath2 dependence .",
    "thanks to the interference terms , there is no sign ambiguity .",
    "inclusion of the polarized data improves the determination of @xmath40 ."
