    "e+a galaxies are understood as post - starburst galaxies due to the presence of strong balmer absorption lines ( h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 ) and the lack of emission lines @xcite . examinations of galaxy morphologies @xcite and companion galaxies statistics @xcite led to the conclusion that local field e+a galaxies are mainly driven by mergers and interactions .",
    "integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) observations for e+a galaxies indicate disturbed morphologies and significant rotation , which supports the theory that they are produced by gas - rich galaxy mergers and interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite has reported that a starburst galaxy ngc 839 has both a - type stellar population and a galactic wind , and has discussed a link between lower - mass starburst systems and e+a galaxies .",
    "an e+a galaxy is one phase in galaxy evolution , and thus , it is important to understand the evolution of e+a galaxies .",
    "all these results , however , are based on information obtained from galaxies already in the @xmath4-starburst phase . in order to investigate the evolution of e+a galaxies",
    ", it is necessary to examine pre - e+a galaxies , or e+a progenitors , which would have both starburst and post - starburst regions , and this requires spatially resolved spectroscopic observations .    in this work",
    ", we observed a possible progenitor of an e+a galaxy , sdss j160241.00 + 521426.9 ( j1602 ) , using the ifs mode of the kyoto tridimensional spectrograph ( kyoto3dii : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mounted on the university of hawaii 88-inch telescope on mauna kea .",
    "the galaxy has an apparent companion galaxy , seen in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) image .",
    "the 3@xmath5-fiber spectra from the sdss show an interesting combination of very strong balmer absorption lines and emission lines . with the ifs observation on the uh 88-inch telescope as well as slit - spectroscopic observations using the subaru telescope faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we investigated the spatial distributions of absorption and emission line regions .",
    "identifying the locations of starburst regions in e+a galaxies provides constrains on e+a galaxy formation theories .",
    "the presence of both post - starburst regions and current starburst regions in one galaxy may provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to examine the progenitor of an e+a galaxy . through detailed analysis",
    ", we attempted to understand the underlying physical process that caused the simultaneous presence of post - starburst and current starburst regions in this galaxy .",
    "we selected a target galaxy which has both strong post - starburst and starburst properties , based on its line ratios from an h@xmath3 strong galaxies catalog @xcite produced from the spectra of the sloan digital sky survey data release 2 ( sdss dr2 : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the redshift of j1602 was measured as 0.0430 @xmath6 0.0001 @xcite , and the distance was estimated as 170 mpc ( 1= 0.82 kpc ) with h = 0.73 , @xmath7 = 0.24 , and @xmath8 = 0.76 @xcite .",
    "a possible companion galaxy appeared in the same field of view ; its redshift had not been measured by the sdss .",
    "we retrieved a k@xmath9-band fits image from 2mass @xcite and estimated the total k@xmath9-band magnitudes of j1602 and the companion galaxy as 14.8 mag and 15.7 mag , respectively .",
    "using mass - to - luminosity ratio of 0.6 @xcite , we calculated the stellar masses of j1602 and the companion galaxy as 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 and 1.5 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 , respectively , assuming that the redshift of the companion galaxy is the same as that of j1602 .",

    "the wavelength resolution in a full - width half maximum was @xmath15 4.8  , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of @xmath15 290 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the ifs data of a spectroscopic standard star from iraf s irscal database , hd161817 , were used for flux calibration , and those of helium and halogen lamps were used for wavelength calibration and flat - fielding , respectively .",

    "we tried voronoi binning @xcite for kyoto3dii data , but quick drop off of continuum flux in outer region led to very large bins , and thus we did not use voronoi binning for kyoto3dii data .",
    "we also observed j1602 and the neighbor galaxy on 2009 may 20 ( ut ) using focas on the subaru telescope .",
    "we adopted a longslit of 0.8 width , and observed with the 300b grism without a filter .",

    "we obtained three sets of 10 min exposures along the major axis of j1602 , and another three sets of 5 min exposures along the major axis of the neighbor .",
    "we used five dome - flat frames for flat fielding . a spectrophotometric standard star from @xcite , bd+28d4211 ,",
    "was observed for flux calibration .",
    "the seeing size , estimated from the standard star , was 0.56 .",
    "the wavelength of each exposure was calibrated using a thar lamp .",
    "the velocity accuracy was estimated to be 17 km s@xmath0 ( 1@xmath16 ) from the lines of the comparison lamp and sky emission .",
    "the averaged sky spectrum was subtracted from target spectra . for investigating the spatial variations of lick indices , we combined adjacent spatial pixels until the s / n ratios of combined pixels reached the target s / n ( cf . voronoi binning : @xcite ) .",
    "target s / n ratios were set as 100 for j1602 and as 50 for the companion galaxy .      in order to predict star - formation history in several regions in the galaxies , we compare in section [ sec : discuss - age ] the observed lick indices of the h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 @xcite and the color indices in the rest - frame with model values .",

    "each model provides the lick indices and the color indices as a function of starburst age , assuming a star - formation history , the salpeter imf @xcite , and no dust .",
    "we calculated three models as follows : ( 1 ) a simple stellar population ( ssp ) model , in which a starburst occurred only at 0 yr , ( 2 ) an exponential ( exp ) model , in which the star - formation rate decreased exponentially ( on a time scale @xmath22 = 1 gyr ) , and ( 3 ) a constant ( const ) model , in which starbursts continued constantly . color indices are calculated from redshift - corrected model spectra .",

    "the fits images were re - sampled using swarp @xcite according to the wcs information of each corrected image .",
    "swarp also subtracted the background .",
    "the zero point for the photometry was calibrated with tsfield .",
    "galactic extinction was corrected according to @xcite , adopting e(b - v ) = 0.015 for j1602 .    as we will compare the color indices with dust - free and emission - free models by @xcite , the internal extinction and the emission line corrections were performed where emission lines were detected . for internal extinction corrections , we used the value estimated from the h@xmath23/h@xmath1 flux ratio observed by focas because the h@xmath2 flux observed with kyoto3dii was affected by absorption and a low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the h@xmath23/h@xmath1 flux ratio was calculated from the galactic extinction corrected values .",
    "the extinction law of @xcite was used for extinction correction for j1602 and its companion galaxy .",
    "we used two reddening ratios between gas and stars : @xmath24 = @xmath25 , which corresponds to a situation that dust exist outside of a star - forming region , and @xmath24 = 0.44 @xmath25 @xcite , which corresponds to a situation that dust coexist with stars and gas in a star - forming region .",
    "for the emission line correction , the spectra observed with focas were used .",
    "we calculated the fraction of the emission line fluxes from measured equivalent widths , and corrected the magnitudes in each band .",
    "this correction was performed for emission lines within the focas wavelength range of 3750  7100  only .",
    "thus , the corrected u - g indices may be redder , and r - i may be bluer . as we can not correct the effect of emission lines in the z - band , no emission line correction for the i - z indices",
    "was attempted .",
    "the lick indices were calculated from kyoto3dii and focas spectra after their spectral resolution was matched to the lick system using fig . 7 and table 8 of @xcite .",
    "lick offsets displayed in table 6 of @xcite ( table [ tb : lick - offsets ] ) were applied to the observed values , because only one and no lick standard star was observed by kyoto3dii and focas , respectively , in our observing runs .",

    "two galaxies fall within our fov : a brighter northern galaxy and a fainter southern one .",
    "we designated the northern galaxy j1602 and the southern one , the possible companion galaxy of j1602 .",

    "we also calculated the redshift of the fainter galaxy from its [ ] @xmath274959,5007 emission lines as 0.0434 @xmath6 0.0002 .",
    "the redshift of the possible companion galaxy is almost the same as that of j1602 , showing that these two galaxies are indeed physically close to each other and , most likely , form a dynamically interacting pair .",
    "as this companion galaxy was not spectroscopically observed with the sdss , our spectroscopic results confirmed for the first time a physical connection between these galaxies .",
    "we defined two regions in j1602 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image-3dii ] ) : the balmer absorption region ( post - starburst region ; hereafter ps1 ) and the [ ] emission region ( starburst region ; hereafter sb1 ) .",
    "these regions were defined by visual inspection of the 3-dimensional data .",
    "the location of ps1 lies at and around the center of j1602 , whereas sb1 is located 2.5 southwest from ps1 .",
    "the apparent sizes of ps1 and sb1 are 2.6 arcsec@xmath28 and 4.1 arcsec@xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the size of ps1 is comparable to the seeing size ( @xmath15 2.5 arcsec@xmath28 ) , whereas that of sb1 is significantly larger than the psf .",

    "h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , and h@xmath3 lines are seen in absorption .",
    "no emission line was found .",
    "strong balmer absorption lines ( lick(h@xmath20 ) = 8.3  : table [ tb : focas - lick ] ) and no emission line suggest that ps1 is a post - starburst region .",
    "we will discuss the age and star - formation history of this region in section [ sec : discuss - age ] .",
    "figure [ fig : image-3dii](f ) shows that h@xmath20 lick index outside ps1 is also larger than @xmath15 5  , which suggest that post - starburst population presents there .",
    "the spectrum of sb1 is quite different from that of ps1 .",
    "figure [ fig : spec-3dii](b ) shows the sb1 spectrum .",
    "the continuum emission in sb1 was fainter than that in ps1 , and no absorption lines were detected .",
    "instead , the [ ] @xmath274959,5007 , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath2 emission lines were detected , which indicates that sb1 is a starburst region .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission line was observed at a low s / n , probably affected by stellar h@xmath2 absorption ( see section [ sec : result - r2-focas ] ) .",
    "although the [ ] @xmath265007/h@xmath1 ratio in this region ( @xmath15 3 ) is similar to typical agn values , we doubt that there is any agn activity in this galaxy , because the [ ] /h@xmath23 and [ ] /h@xmath23 ratios from sdss observation data are much smaller than theoretical maximum starburst lines defined by @xcite .",
    "moreover , given that the observed h@xmath23 flux is reduced by stellar absorption , the intrinsic [ ] /h@xmath23 and [ ] /h@xmath23 ratios are probably even smaller .",
    "the star formation rate was estimated with two different assumptions . from the h@xmath2/h@xmath1 flux ratio , we estimated the extinction as 3.0 mag in the v - band using the intrinsic h@xmath2/h@xmath1 ratio of 0.466 @xcite and the @xcite extinction law .",
    "the star - formation rate in sb1 , calculated from the extinction - corrected h@xmath1 flux in 4.1 arcsec@xmath28 , which corresponds to 3.4 kpc@xmath28 , was estimated as 2.4 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , if we assume that the observed h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 fluxes represent the combination of emissions and absorptions whose equivalent widths were the same as those of ps1 , we can estimate the extinction as @xmath15 0 mag .",

    "similar velocity fields were detected in h@xmath1 and [ ] @xmath264959 , although their fluxes were weaker than that of [ ] @xmath265007 .",

    "the difference in stellar mass or mass / luminosity ratio due to differences in stellar ages may have produced this asymmetry .",
    "the shape of the companion galaxy is also asymmetric .",
    "the eastern side of this galaxy is 5 kpc longer than the western side , if we consider that the continuum flux peak marks the galactic center .",
    "we defined three regions in j1602 in a manner similar to that used for the kyoto3dii definitions : the balmer absorption region ( ps1 ) , the emission lines region ( sb1 ) , and the region on the side opposite sb1 ( ps2 ) .",

    "[ fig : tmb - ps1 ] , the h@xmath1 lick index is plotted against the [ mgfe ] index , which is defined as @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "these are good metallicity indicators , as the h@xmath1 index has little sensitivity to element ratio variations or total metallicity , and the [ mgfe ] index is independent of @xmath23/fe @xcite . in this figure , we emphasized focas data rather than sdss data because the sdss spectrum contains a component of sb1 as well as ps1 due to its wide aperture ( 3 ) .",
    "star - formation history used for the model is ssp .",
    "metallicity z = 0.004 , 0.008 , or 0.02 , which is comparable to the value estimated from the [ ] @xmath266583/h@xmath23 flux ratio at sb1 , can explain observed index values .",
    "the lick indices and color indices of ps2 are close to those of ps1 except for u - g color , which indicates that ps2 is also a post - starburst region . because of the bluer u - g color , the exp and const models at @xmath15 1 gyr can also reproduce the observed lick indices and color indices of ps2 . however , these models conflict with the fact that no emission line was found in ps2 .",
    "it is unlikely that j1602 has recently formed population only , because it would be necessary to maintain large star - formation rate , e.g. , more than 30 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0 for 100 myr , to produce observed stellar mass of j1602 , 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 . even larger star - formation rate would be required for the shorter star - formation duration .",
    "we roughly estimated the fraction of the stellar mass of post - starburst population to total stellar mass of j1602 using lick index of h@xmath20 .",
    "the observed index is almost the maximum value possible in the models , thus it will put a severe constraint .",
    "we assumed a combination of two stellar population for j1602 : post - starburst population ( burst model ) and old population ( exp 10 gyr ) .",
    "the continuum flux was normalized with g - band magnitude , and metallicity z = 0.004 and 0.008 were used . for producing more than 6  of h@xmath20 index , more than @xmath15 20 % of post - starburst population is needed , whether star formation duration of burst model was 100 myr or 300 myr . in order to produce this post - starburst population , star - formation rate of 11 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0 or 4 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0",
    "is required when masses of already dead early - type stars are also taken into consideration .",
    "although even 4 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0 may be too large for j1602 , whose stellar mass is only 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 , 300 myr burst would be more plausible .",
    "even larger h@xmath20 index of 7.5  is required at ps1 , and more than 40 ",
    "70 % of post - starburst population is needed .",
    "many observed color indices in sb1 and sb2 are redder than those in ps1 and ps2 .",
    "this is consistent with the sdss image ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3dii - sdss](a ) ) : the western side of the companion galaxy is redder than the eastern side . we consider that dust formed by starbursts is reddening the western side .",
    "the extinction and emission - line corrected indices in sb1 correspond to the exp or const model at 100 myr",
    " 1 gyr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : color - model ] ) .",
    "these indices also correspond to the ssp model at 6  100 myr .",
    "taking further into consideration the observed h@xmath23 and h@xmath1 equivalent widths ( table [ tb : focas - reg2 ] ) and a starburst model ( starburst99 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the const model at 300  400 myr or the ssp model at @xmath15 6 myr is most likely .",
    "the sb2 age is about the same as or slightly older than sb1 because of similar color indices and smaller h@xmath23 and h@xmath1 equivalent widths ( table [ tb : focas - rega ] ) .",
    "sb1 probably has post - starburst population as well as young population .",
    "if the post - starburst population greatly affects the observed color indices , the conclusion with respect to sb1 star - formation history is invalid . to estimate the effect of the post - starburst population , assuming that the magnitudes of the post - starburst population in sb1 are the same as those in ps2 , which is the opposite side to sb1 , we calculated that the fraction of flux from the post - starburst population is only @xmath15 30% and color indices are affected by only @xmath15 0.07 mag .",
    "therefore , the conclusion of sb1 star - formation history derived from sb1 color is valid .      from our results",
    ", we suggest a history of j1602 .",
    "( a ) before galaxy interaction , both j1602 and its companion galaxy were probably in only a moderate star - formation phase .",
    "( b ) they came close to each other and starbursts occurred within central 2 kpc of j1602 , including ps1 , ps2 , and maybe sb1 .",
    "( c ) starbursts within central 2 kpc were suddenly quenched about 200 myr ago whereas starburst in sb1 may have continued .",
    "( d ) in the present state , ps1 and ps2 have become post - starburst regions whereas sb1 is still or have become a starburst region .",
    "( e ) in the future , starburst at sb1 would eventually stop , and all of j1602 would become post - starburst regions . if a gas mass of 10@xmath34 m@xmath12 , for example , is continuously converted into stars in the present star - formation rate in sb1 ( 0.25 m@xmath12 yr@xmath0 , section [ sec : result - r2-focas ] ) , the starburst will continue further for about 400 myr and j1602 will become a pure - e+a galaxy after about 600 myr from now ( i.e. , about 200 myr after the starburst stops ) .",
    "we suggest two possible scenarios of starbursts in the second phase ( b ) . (",
    "b1 ) there was enough gas in all of j1602 , and galaxy interaction triggered starbursts within its central 2 kpc ; or : ( b2 ) the gas was transported from the companion galaxy to j1602 , and galaxy interaction triggered starbursts within central 2 kpc .",
    "this scenario , however , needs a large amount of gas transfer .",
    "assuming that half of stars in ps1 were produced in phase ( b ) ( section [ sec : two - pop - model ] ) , we calculated the produced stellar mass as 1.5 @xmath10 10@xmath34 m@xmath12 by using observed sdss magnitude in ps1 and galaxev @xcite .",
    "even if the amount of gas in the companion galaxy is one - tenth of its stellar mass , 1.5 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 ( section [ sec : obs - target ] ) , the gas mass will be equal to the required amount",
    ". it would be difficult to transfer almost all gas in the companion galaxy since the galaxy mass ratio of j1602 to the companion is only @xmath15 2 .",
    "therefore , we consider the ( b1 ) scenario is more plausible",
    ".    we suggest three possible causes for starbursts to cease in the third phase ( c ) .",
    "( c1 ) all gas within the central 2 kpc was completely consumed , whereas gas in sb1 may still have remained . in this scenario , however , star formation would not fall sharply .",
    "thus , this scenario may not produce large lick indices of h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 .",
    "( c2 ) gas transport from the companion galaxy to j1602 ceased , and there was no gas in j1602 , whereas gas in sb1 may still have remained .",
    "as mentioned above , however , gas transport from the companion galaxy is not likely .",
    "( c3 ) galactic winds occurred and expelled gas from the central 2 kpc .",
    "galactic winds can quench a starburst suddenly and produce large lick indices .",
    "although no signature of galactic winds was found in j1602 through our observations , it would not be a serious problem because the time since the galactic wind occurred in j1602 is much longer than the typical dynamical timescales of galactic winds , which are shorter than 10 myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we consider the ( c3 ) scenario is plausible .",
    "we should mention the timescales of galaxy rotation and galaxy movement because these are comparable to the timescale between phase ( c ) and phase ( d ) , about 200 myr . assuming that the dynamical mass of j1602 within central 2 kpc is equal to its stellar mass , 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 , we calculate that stars at ps2 make one rotation around j1602 s center in 150 myr .",
    "thus , the post - starburst population in ps2 was not necessarily born at the apparent present place .",
    "taking into account the rotation of j1602 , we suggest two possible scenarios of the place where its starburst occurred in phase ( b ) .",
    "one scenario is that the starburst occurred in the whole central 2 kpc of j1602 .",
    "this includes the case of an axisymmetric starburst distribution .",
    "the other scenario is that the starburst occurred only at ps1 and the near side to the companion galaxy ( e.g. , ngc 6090 : * ? ? ?",
    "stars which had been born at the near side moved to the apparent present ps2 position by galaxy rotation and are now observed as a post - starburst population there .",
    "we also roughly estimated timescale of the galaxy motion , although the relative tangential velocity and the relative radial distance are uncertain .",
    "it takes 30 myr for galaxies to move the apparent distance between j1602 and the companion galaxy , 4 kpc , with the observed relative radial velocity , 100 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this means that j1602 and the companion in phase ( c ) were at a different orbital position compared to phase ( d ) .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that the first pericenter triggered a starburst in phase ( b ) and the second one triggered a starburst in phase ( d ) .",
    "j1602 and the companion galaxy are not severely disturbed in terms of morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image - focas ] ) , unlike ngc 4038/9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) or ngc 4676 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . it may be because they did not experience a head - on collision and/or they are at the beginning of a collision .",
    "to guess whether the collision between these galaxies is prograde or retrograde , we calculated the velocity in each region . from balmer absorption lines ,",
    "the stellar velocity of ps2 relative to ps1 ( i.e. , the center of j1602 ) was calculated as + 100 km s@xmath0 .",
    "thus , j1602 rotates in a clockwise direction as viewed from north - west side if we assume a simple galaxy rotation .",
    "since the velocity of sb2 ( i.e. , the center of the companion galaxy ) relative to ps1 was calculated as + 200 km s@xmath0 , we suggest that this collision is retrograde .    many galaxy - merger simulations ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "indicate that gas falls into the center faster than stars .",
    "thus , it may be strange that in phase ( d ) sb1 is a starburst region but ps1 ( the galactic center ) is not .",
    "@xcite indicates that shock - induced star formation provides a better match to the observation of ngc 4676 , an interacting galaxy system , than the density - dependent model ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the shock - induced models ,",
    "more star formation occurs outside the center compared with the density - dependent model .",
    "there are some examples of off - center starbursts in interacting galaxy systems , such as sdss j101345.39 + 011613.66 @xcite , sdss j161330.18 + 510335.5 @xcite , and ngc 6090 @xcite .",
    "our observational data enable us to investigate the spatial distributions of absorption and emission line regions , and to suggest a history of an interesting galaxy , j1602 .",
    "however , we can not completely understand j1602 s history , e.g. , the causes of starbursts in phase ( b ) and quenching of them in phase ( c ) . or co map observation of j1602 will be helpful .",
    "neutral / molecular gas emission will be detected mainly in sb1 , not in ps1 , if scenarios ( b1 ) and ( c1 ) are true .",
    "if a large amount of neutral / molecular gas emission is detected between j1602 and its companion galaxy , scenarios ( b2 ) and ( c2 ) would be plausible .",
    "follow - up observation of this interesting j1602 system , such as molecular gas mapping , is important for examining the evolution of e+a galaxies .",
    "in order to investigate the evolution of e+a galaxies , we observed sdss j1602 and its neighbor galaxy with kyoto3dii and focas .",
    "these are the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of e+a progenitors .",
    "we found a post - starburst region in the center of j1602 ( ps1 ) and a starburst region located 2 kpc from the center ( sb1 ) , in the direction of the neighbor galaxy .",
    "the fact that this galaxy has both starburst and post - starburst regions indicates that it is in a critical phase of evolution .",
    "the recession velocities of j1602 and its neighbor galaxy differ only by @xmath15 100 km s@xmath0 .",
    "thus , they are a physical pair and are considered to have been interacting , probably in a retrograde encounter . a local velocity field of 80 km s@xmath0 is detected in sb1 .",
    "comparing the observed lick indices of the h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 and color indices to those predicted from stellar population synthesis models , we find that a suddenly quenched star - formation scenario is plausible for the star - formation history of ps1 . from our results",
    ", we suggest a history for j1602 .",
    "starbursts occurred within 2 kpc from the center of j1602 probably due to galaxy interaction , then about 200 myr ago starbursts were suddenly quenched , whereas the starburst in sb1 may have continued or have occurred recently .",
    "the sb1 starburst will eventually stop , and all of j1602 will become a post - starburst .",
    "follow - up observation , for example molecular gas mapping of this system , will further elucidate the evolution process of e+a galaxies .",

    "<S> in order to investigate the evolution of e+a galaxies , we observed a galaxy sdss j160241.00 + 521426.9 , a possible e+a progenitor which shows both emission and strong balmer absorptions , and its neighbor galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we used the integral field spectroscopic mode of the kyoto tridimensional spectrograph ( kyoto3dii ) , mounted on the university of hawaii 88-inch telescope located on mauna kea , and the slit - spectroscopic mode of the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ) on the subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we found a strong balmer absorption region in the center of the galaxy and an emission - line region located 2 kpc from the center , in the direction of its neighbor galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the recession velocities of the galaxy and its neighbor galaxy differ only by 100 km s@xmath0 , which suggests that they are a physical pair and would have been interacting . </S>",
    "<S> comparing observed lick indices of balmer lines and color indices with those predicted from stellar population synthesis models , we find that a suddenly quenched star - formation scenario is plausible for the star - formation history of the central region . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that star formation started in the galaxy due to galaxy interactions and was quenched in the central region , whereas star formation in a region offset from the center still continues or has begun recently . </S>",
    "<S> this work is the first study of a possible e+a progenitor using spatially resolved spectroscopy . </S>"
