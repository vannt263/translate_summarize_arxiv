    "the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are assumed to be smooth according to condition [ a : assumption1 ] and periodic with period 1 in every direction with respect to the second variable .",
    "if @xmath8 is of order @xmath9 while @xmath10 tends to zero , large deviations theory tells how quickly ( [ eq : ldpanda1 ] ) converges to the deterministic ode given by setting @xmath10 equal to zero .",
    "if @xmath10 is of order @xmath9 while @xmath8 tends to zero , homogenization occurs and one obtains an equation with homogenized coefficients . if the two parameters go to zero together then one expects different behaviors depending on how fast @xmath10 goes to zero relative to @xmath8 .",
    "using the weak convergence approach of @xcite , we investigate the large deviations principle ( ldp ) of @xmath11 under the following three regimes : @xmath12 the weak convergence approach results in a convenient representation formula for the large deviations action functional ( otherwise known as the rate function ) for all three regimes ( theorem [ t : maintheorem2 ] ) .",
    "it is based on the representation theorem [ t : representationtheorem ] , which in this case involves controlled sde s with fast oscillating coefficients . along the way",
    ", we obtain a uniform proof of convergence of the underlying controlled sde ( csde ) in all three regimes ( theorem [ t : maintheorem1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , in some cases we construct a control that nearly achieves the large deviations lower bound at the prelimit level .",
    "this control is useful , in particular , for the design of efficient importance sampling schemes .",
    "the particular use of the control will appear elsewhere .",
    "a motivation for this work comes from chemical physics and biology , and in particular from the dynamical behavior of proteins such as their folding and binding kinetics .",
    "it was suggested long ago ( e.g. , @xcite ) that the potential surface of a protein might have a hierarchical structure with potential minima within potential minima .",
    "the underlying energy landscapes of certain biomolecules can be rugged ( i.e. , consist of many minima separated by barriers of varying heights ) due to the presence of multiple energy scales associated with the building blocks of proteins .",
    "roughness of the energy landscapes that describe proteins has numerous effects on their folding and binding as well as on their behavior at equilibrium .",
    "often , these phenomena are described mathematically by diffusion in a rough potential where a smooth function is superimposed by a rough function ( see figure [ f : figure1 ] ) .",
    "a representative , but by no means complete , list of references is @xcite .",

    "the questions of interest in these papers are related to the effect of taking @xmath18 with @xmath10 small but fixed .",
    "this is almost the same to requiring that @xmath8 goes to @xmath19 much faster than @xmath10 does .",
    "our goal is to study the related large deviations principle , so we take @xmath4 as well .",
    "it will become clear that the formula for the effective diffusivity ( denoted by @xmath20 in corollary [ c : maincorollary2 ] ) that appears in the aforementioned chemistry and biology literature is obtained under regime @xmath9 .",
    "singularly perturbed stochastic control problems and related large deviations problems have been studied elsewhere ( see for example @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the authors study the large deviation problem for periodic coefficients , i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , using other methods . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide an explicit formula for the action functional in regime @xmath9 , whereas in regimes @xmath23 and @xmath24 the action functional is in terms of solutions to variational problems . in the present paper , we derive the same explicit expression for the action functional in regime @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we also obtain the related control that nearly achieves the ldp lower bound at the prelimit level . for regimes @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "we provide an alternative expression , from @xcite , for the action functional ( theorem [ t : maintheorem2 ] ) .",
    "it follows from these expressions that regime @xmath24 can be seen as a limiting case of regime @xmath23 by simply setting @xmath25 , though we are able to prove the large deviation lower bound in regime 3 only under additional conditions . for both regimes",
    "we derive explicit expressions for the action functional in special cases of interest , and in regime 2 obtain a corresponding control that nearly achieves the ldp lower bound .",
    "note that the extension of the results of @xcite for regime 2 to include the @xmath26dependence is non - trivial , since several smoothness properties of the local rate function need to be proven ( see subsection [ s : boundedoptimalcontrolregime2 ] for details ) .",
    "apart from @xcite , regime @xmath23 has also been studied in @xcite under various assumptions and dependencies of the coefficients of the system on the slow and fast motion . in @xcite , the local rate function",
    "is characterized as the legendre - fenchel transform of the limit of the normalized logarithm of an exponential moment or of the first eigenvalue of an associated operator . in the present paper",
    ", we provide a direct expression for the local rate function ( theorem [ t : maintheorem4regime2 ] ) .",
    "we note here that in the case of regime @xmath9 one can weaken the periodicity assumption , using the results of @xcite and the methodology of the present paper , and prove an analogous result when the fast variable takes values in @xmath27",
