    "the accretion phenomena are usually observed during the phases of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , which can be considered as the progenitors of msps .",
    "the process usually leads to a deep transformation of both the accreting and the donor stars : the former is accelerated to millisecond spin periods , while the latter can evolve into an intermediate anomalous evolutionary phase ( see , e.g. , msp - a in ngc 6397 ; * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , in the galactic field the most plausible channel for the formation of msps is the evolution of primordial binaries , while in gcs dynamical interactions promote the formation of a conspicuous number of exotic objects , such as blue straggler stars , x - ray binaries , cataclysmic variables and msps @xcite , which can be used to trace the complex interplay between dynamics and stellar evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in this respect , the study of optical companions to binary msps in gcs is of outmost importance since it opens the possibility to evaluate the frequency and time - scales of dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems , to explore the impact of dynamics on msp evolutionary paths and to investigate stellar evolution under extreme conditions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . +",

    "such a small value could be due to vaporization from the strong msp radiation and relativistic wind ; thus these systems may provide a possible explanation to the existence of isolated msps , even if their observed number is too large if compared to the expected timescale for the total ablation of the companion stars @xcite .",

    "of course , additional identifications of bw companions are needed to firmly characterize the evolution of these objects .",
    "in addition , using equation ( [ delta ] ) for com - m5c , setting the filling factor @xmath96 and using the spin - down period from @xcite to evaluate the spin - down luminosity ( @xmath97 ) , we found a reprocessing efficiency @xmath98 , a value fully in agreement with what found for com - m71a , thus further strengthening the analogies between these two systems .",
    "usually , bws with a high energy counterpart do not show any appreciable x - ray variability related to their orbital period ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively for the bws in the gc 47 tucanae and in the galactic field ) .",
    "however , this could be an observational bias , due to the lack of deep enough and systematic surveys of bws in the x - rays .",
    "on the other hand , it is worth noting that several rb systems clearly show orbital x - ray modulation likely due to the presence of intra - binary shocks @xcite .",
    "m71a is an exception , since it has been found to show periodic x - ray variability @xcite . very interestingly",
    ", the determination of com - m71a optical light curve offers the opportunity to perform a comparison between the two .",
    "the most intriguing feature emerging from the comparison of the light curves ( both folded with the binary system parameters ) is that the phase spanned by the radio eclipses ( @xmath99 ) does not correspond to the phase of the x - ray minimum ( @xmath100 ) , but it nicely lines up with the optical minimum ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "thus we found that the x - ray minimum precedes the optical psr superior conjunction .",
    "a similar effect was already observed for the rb 47tucw , a 2.35 ms binary msp with an orbital period of @xmath102 hr and a companion mass of @xmath103 @xcite , whose optical light curves indicate the presence of a strong heating @xcite , as usually observed for bw systems . for this object @xcite argue that the x - ray variability can be attributed to the presence of an intra - binary shock that is eclipsed by the companion star .",
    "the length of the x - ray eclipse suggests that this shock is located closer to the companion star than to the msp .",
    "in particular this behavior could be due to a swept - back shocked region , produced by the interaction between the psr wind and the stream of gas issuing from the inner lagrange point l1 , elongated perpendicular to the semi - major axis of the binary ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description ) .",
    "despite the low x - ray statistics , this is likely to be the case also for m71a , where the intra - binary shock could be eclipsed just before the psr superior conjunction . even for a companion that is under - filling its roche lobe , this shocked region",
    "can be created thanks to the stellar wind which can result in mass outflow through l1 @xcite .",
    "+ as discussed in @xcite , the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ( amxp ) sax j1808.4@xmath83658 , during quiescent states , shows several analogies with the rb 47tucw , in terms of both the x - ray spectrum and the optical variability .",
    "based on the discussion above , these properties are also similar to those observed for m71a and , very interestingly , even the companion mass is comparable in these two cases : above @xmath104 for com - m71a , and @xmath105 for the companion to sax j1808.4@xmath8365 @xcite .",
    "this puts m71a in the middle of the riddle , supporting the possibility that amxps could be the bridge between rb and bw systems @xcite .",
    "clearly , multi - wavelength studies of these objects are urged to unveil connections between amxps and eclipsing msps , and between bws and rbs .",
    "indeed , several important new connections between amxps and rbs have been made in the last years , especially with the discoveries of systems transitioning from one state to the other ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we presented a phase - connected radio timing solution for the bw psr j1953 + 1846a , which includes a very precise position and orbital parameters determination . taking advantage of this precise measure of the psr position",
    ", we have used a set of high resolution acs / hst images to search for the companion star in the optical bands .",
    "we identified a faint and strongly variable star ( com - m71a ) , showing a modulation of at least three magnitudes in both used filters ( f606w and f814w ) . in the cmd ,",
    "com - m71a lies in the region between the cluster ms and the wd cooling sequences , thus suggesting that it is a low - mass , non - degenerate or at least semi - degenerate star , with a temperature of about 5100  k. unfortunately , because of its faintness , it was detectable only in 16 out of 27 images , mostly during the psr inferior conjunction .",
    "the light curve shows a sinusoidal shape with a period fully consistent with the binary msp .",
    "the maximum , during the psr inferior conjunction , and the minimum , during the psr superior conjunction suggest a strong heating of the companion star side exposed to the psr flux .",
    "such a behavior is in good agreement with that observed for similar objects in the galactic field . by modeling the light curve",
    ", we showed that the companion reprocessing efficiency of the psr energy is @xmath89 for a roche lobe filling companion , while a typical value of @xmath106 is reasonable by assuming a filling factor of 0.6 .",
    "the comparison between the optical and x - ray light curves suggests the possible presence of intra - binary shocks , similarly to what observed for the rb 47tucw .",
    "a x - ray and optical follow - up will highlight the presence of this shocks and , possibly , will allow to characterize their properties and structure .",
    "unfortunately , the star is too faint to allow a spectroscopic follow - up with the available instruments .",
    "however , an optimized photometric follow - up would provide the opportunity of better constrain the system properties , and by using , for example , phase - resolved observations with a narrow @xmath107 filter we could constrain the presence of ionized material , eventually related to the intra - binary shocks . + com - m71a is , so far , the second bw optical companion identified in a gc after com - m5c in m5 .",
    "interestingly , both the light curve shape and the position in the cmd are quite similar in the two systems .",
    "this suggests that probably the two objects undergo a similar evolutionary path . even though the statistic is by far too limited to draw any meaningful conclusion , at the moment no significant difference with the bw optical companions observed in the field",
    "can be evidenced , probably suggesting that no dynamical interactions are strictly needed for forming these systems .",
