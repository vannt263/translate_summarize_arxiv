    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can significantly affect the properties of their host galaxies through mechanical feedback provided by winds and jets . fast",
    "( @xmath7 ) outflowing winds manifest themselves observationally as blueshifted , broad absorption lines ( bals ) in the uv / optical spectra of @xmath8% of quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , although it is likely that they exist in most quasars and we only detect them when our line - of - sight passes directly through the outflowing material ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . as this material is not static ,",
    "variability is expected in the bals on a range of timescales characteristic of , e.g. ,  variations in the ionization parameter and/or changes in the flow structure or disk rotation .",
    "there have been many studies of the uv variability of bals in samples of quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "these find that bal variability is both more common and stronger on longer rest - frame timescales and in weaker and higher velocity bals , with the dominant parameter being the equivalent width ( ew ) of the bal @xcite .    in the disk - wind scenario ,",
    "the wind is launched from the accretion disk at @xmath9@xmath10 and is driven by uv line pressure . for a central source emitting typical levels of",
    ", this requires some `` shielding gas '' to be located between it and the wind to prevent over - ionization of the outflow ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this gas may be responsible for the absorption commonly observed in the spectra of bal quasars which is well fit with either a partially covering and/or a partially ionized absorption model with typical column densities of @xmath11 @xmath12 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this absorption is also observed to vary in some cases @xcite , possibly as a result of complex dynamics related to rotating , infalling , or outflowing material .",
    "compared with non - bal quasars of a similar uv luminosity , bal quasars are underluminous in ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but , after correcting for the effects of absorption , a majority are found to have similar underlying spectral properties to those of non - bal quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . however , some bal quasars are likely to be intrinsically weak @xcite and in such cases , shielding gas is not required to ensure launching of the wind .",
    "approximately 10% of agn have powerful , highly collimated and relativistic jets which emerge from the inner regions ( @xmath13@xmath10 ) of the agn and emit strongly at radio and frequencies via synchrotron and synchrotron self compton ( ssc ;  @xcite ) processes .",
    "radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) which possess such jets have higher luminosities than radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ;  e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and flatter ( harder ) power - law spectral indices ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) as a result of this additional jet - linked emission component @xcite .",
    "counterparts to extended radio jets have been observed in many agn ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "diffuse emission has also been detected tracing the direction of radio jets and unseen counterjets ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and radio lobes ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and is likely due to inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( ic / cmb ) by relativistic jet electrons .",
    "it was originally thought that quasars could not host both a bal wind and a radio jet ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , many subsequent discoveries of radio - loud ( rl ) bal quasars have now been made ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) although bals are still not found in quasars with the highest levels of radio - loudness ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the radio jet and bal wind may affect each other , despite being emitted from different locations within the agn .",
    "it is perhaps more likely that physical properties of the central engine such as mass accretion rate and the spin of the black hole are responsible for the presence of either phenomenon , although no significant differences in the black hole masses or the eddington ratios of radio - quiet ( rq ) and rl bal quasars have been found @xcite .",
    "rl and rq bal quasars also show similar optical properties @xcite .",
    "however @xcite suggest that differences in the bal properties of rq and rl quasars are due to a softer uv / optical sed , indicated by a lower ew , which are preferentially found in rl bals .",
    "bal variability in rlqs does not depend strongly on radio loudness @xcite , but lobe - dominated rlqs may show greater fractional bal variability than core - dominated rlqs @xcite . when considering variability on the same timescales , rlqs show a lower fractional variability than rqqs , @xmath14% @xcite .",
    "rl bal quasars are weak compared to rl non - bal quasars as expected , but to a lesser degree than the difference between rq bal and rq non - bal quasars .",
    "this suggests that the absorption does not affect all of the jet - linked emission @xcite .",

    "although the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum did not show any significant absorption , the _ chandra _ spectrum obtained 20-months ( observed - frame ) later , revealed complex absorption best - fit with a partial - covering model ( @xmath11 @xmath22@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 ) .",
    "pg  1004 + 130 has also been observed by the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was weakly detected in the @xmath27  kev band , suggesting that the shielding gas is either compton thick or that pg  1004 + 130 is intrinsically weak , although neither scenario was strongly preferred over the other @xcite .",
    "if the absorbing material is compton thick , we would expect to detect a strong fe  k@xmath28 emission line , but this is not observed ( m06 ;  @xcite )",
    ". its absence could be due to emission related to a jet diluting the spectrum @xcite , a scenario also favored by broadband modeling @xcite .",

    "the surface - brightness of the radio lobe to the se decreases outwards i.e. ,  a fanaroff - riley i ( fri ) classification @xcite , while the surface - brightness of the nw lobe increases outwards ( frii ) .",
    "this asymmetry is likely due to twin jets propagating into dissimilar large - scale environments , i.e. ,  the density of the surrounding medium is higher to the se so that the jet is more quickly decollimated @xcite . the imaging analysis reported in m06 revealed an counterpart to the radio jet extending to the se @xmath5 from the nucleus and upstream from the peak of the radio jet emission .",
    "large - scale diffuse emission was also detected , extending @xmath32 outward from the nucleus with a flux of @xmath33 ( assuming a power - law model with @xmath25 @xmath34 ; m06 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we present results from newly obtained and uv observations of pg  1004 + 130 , and compare them to archival data .",
    "this allows us to probe for variability of the absorption , the broad absorption line , and the jet emission on month - to - year timescales . by combining multiple",
    "observations we obtain the deepest imaging to date of an jet in a hymor radio source , with @xmath4 greater sensitivity than the original data used in m06 .",

    "this was previously observed and discussed in m06 .",
    "however , the detectability of absorption is dependent on the spectral quality . as",
    "the 2003 _ xmm - newton _ spectra contain fewer counts than are required to significantly detect absorption of @xmath142@xmath23 ( the level measured in the 2013 _ xmm - newton _ data ) , 100% of the time ( see @xcite for detectability curves ) , this may be limiting our ability to significantly detect absorption even though it is present in the source .",
    "if instead , we fix @xmath25 to the value obtained from the fit to high energies ( @xmath143  kev ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : xray_spectra ] , we do measure a significant absorption component with @xmath144@xmath23 .",
    "this is consistent with the absorption measured in the 2013 _ xmm - newton _ data using the same spectral modeling .",
    "we therefore suggest that the spectral properties of pg  1004 + 130 indicated in both _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations may be consistent , and therefore the amount of intrinsic absorption has not varied dramatically between all 4 observations .",
    "if each of the data sets are modeled with an absorbed power - law in which @xmath25 is fixed to the values obtained from the fit to high energies ( @xmath143  kev ) , steeper power - law slopes and higher absorption columns are obtained ( see table  [ table : fits ] ) .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath25 values remain slightly flatter than expected ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which may indicate that the shape of the underlying continuum above @xmath87  kev is still affected by the absorption . if the spectra are modeled with a power - law using only energies greater than @xmath145  kev , slightly steeper spectral indices are obtained but they remain formally consistent ( @xmath146 ) with the previous estimates . adopting these steeper @xmath25 values in",
    "the subsequent absorption modeling leads to a possible increase in the absorption column density of a factor @xmath147 .    thus far",

    "we therefore also fit the spectra with a partially covering absorption model ( ` tbabs*zpcfabs*po ` in xspec ) and a partially ionized absorption model ( ` tbabs*zxipcf*po ` ) , in which zxipcf @xcite is implemented with @xmath148 fixed at 1.0 to model a partially ionized , but fully covering , absorber .",

    "for both models the best - fitting spectral parameters are consistent when comparing the 2 _ chandra _ observations or the 2 _ xmm - newton _ observations .",

    "quasar - wind simulations suggest this gas should be variable on timescales of months - to - yrs ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "we have shown that the absorption properties of pg  1004 + 130 measured in 4 observations taken up to 8.8  yrs ( rest - frame ) apart do not differ substantially , regardless of the spectral model used . when a fully covering and neutral absorber is assumed , the column densities range from @xmath0  @xmath1 , which are among the lowest values typically observed @xcite .",
    "however , the power - law slopes obtained in the modeling are @xmath259 , perhaps indicating that the true levels of absorption in the source may be higher by a factor of @xmath260 ( see section  [ section : fitting ] ) . in the case of a partially covering absorber ,",
    "the column densities obtained are naturally higher , @xmath261  @xmath1 , and more consistent with those for other bal quasars .",

    "as the absorption properties do not appear to vary , the absorption is perhaps more likely to be due to material located further from the central source , rather than the typical shielding gas expected on small scales . in the case",
    "that pg  1004 + 130 is intrinsically x - ray weak , such a shield is not required to ensure launching of the bal wind . alternatively ,",
    "if pg  1004 + 130 is intrinsically normal , the shielding gas is required to be highly compton - thick ( @xmath262 ; @xcite ) .",
    "absorption with column densities this high would not be detectable in _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ spectra as all below @xmath13  kev would be absorbed . in both scenarios",
    "the emission we observe is therefore predominantly from the jet ; either because the continuum source is weak in comparison , or because we only see from the portion of the jet extending beyond the shielding gas .",
    "this emission may then be absorbed by material further from the black hole , naturally explaining the lack of variability and lower column densities observed .",
    "however , we can not rule out variability occurring at a level below that which we are able to significantly detect with our spectra",
    ". a column density increase of more than a factor of 2 would be detected as a @xmath39 change between the _ chandra _ spectra .    in the scenario",
    "in which pg  1004 + 130 is intrinsically x - ray normal and is absorbed by compton - thick shielding gas , a strong fe k@xmath28 emission line at 6.4  kev with an ew of @xmath263  ev is expected ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . although we do measure a low level of neutral iron emission in a joint fitting of all 4 x - ray spectra ( @xmath156 ;  see section  [ section : fitting ] ) , it is not as strong as might be expected",
    ". this may be due to the dilution of the spectrum by jet - linked x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the light curve in section  [ section : lightcurve ] shows significant flux variability between the 4 observations .",
    "given the constant level of absorption present , these changes are more likely related to intrinsic variations within the continuum source itself ( in the case that pg  1004 + 130 is intrinsically weak ) , or fluctuations in the jet .    in stark contrast to the absorption properties , the bal in pg  1004 + 130 shows large - amplitude variability .",
    "the archival observations we compare with our newly obtained _ hst _ cos spectrum probe rest - frame timescales of during which large absolute and fractional changes in ew are observed ( see table  [ table : uv_bal ] ) . however , the largest changes are between the 2003 and 1986 spectra , i.e. ,  @xmath264   and @xmath265 . the magnitudes of these changes place pg  1004 + 130 among the most variable rl and rq bal quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "our measurements probe long rest - frame timescales , on which bal variability is observed to be stronger ( see section  [ section : intro ] ) . in figure  [ fig : bal_compare ] we compare the absolute and fractional bal variability of pg  1004 + 130 ( red , solid points ) to the sample of rl bal quasars presented in @xcite  ( @xcite ;  open black circles ) .",
    "this highlights the large variability of pg  1004 + 130 in relation to other rl bal quasars , even despite the longer rest - frame timescales probed by our observations .",
    "variability in bal troughs is likely caused by 2 main effects ; clumps of material in the outflow moving across our line - of - sight to the continuum source , or the material responding to changes in the incident ionizing radiation .",
    "when only portions of the bal trough spanning a narrow velocity range show changes , perhaps with some portions strengthening while others weaken ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , clouds at different velocities , and hence distances from the continuum source , entering and leaving the line - of - sight is a plausible explanation , although it could also be a result of velocity - dependent optical depths @xcite",
    ". however , many observations of bals show co - ordinated changes in separate troughs of the same ion , for example , distinct bal troughs tend to strengthen or weaken together @xcite . in this case , variations occurring over such a large velocity range are unlikely to be the result of co - ordinated movements within the outflow which would disperse the structure ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . instead , these , and global changes in which the entire profile of a single wide bal trough varies uniformly ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , are likely a result of a change in the ionizing euv continuum .",
    "however this can only occur if the absorption trough is not too highly saturated .",
    "portions of the trough with low optical depths may show larger variations as they are more susceptible to changes in ionization , than those with only moderate optical depths .",
    "the changes observed in the bal profile of pg  1004 + 130 suggest a combination of these scenarios .",
    "this is most apparent when considering the bal trough in the 1986 observation , which appears to be comprised of a main trough centered on @xmath266   ( @xmath267 ) and an additional absorption feature with a smaller blueshift superimposed .",
    "this component , at @xmath268   ( @xmath269 ) , does not appear in the other 3 observations ( there is a hint of a similar component in the 1982 spectrum but its depth is within 10% of the continuum level and could therefore be noise ) , and its narrow width suggests it may be due to cloud of material in the line - of - sight during the observation .",
    "making the assumptions that such a cloud is spherical , moving perpendicular to the line - of - sight and passing in front of a negligible size source , we can place an upper limit on the radius of the cloud of @xmath270 , as it must have traveled at least its diameter , at @xmath271 , in the 6163  day period .",
    "the remainder of the bal trough in the 1986 spectrum has a similar shape to that in 1982 , although both the width and depth have increased by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "such a monolithic change is more likely to be the result of the entire outflow varying in response to a change in the ionizing continuum .",
    "however , the uv flux does not change significantly between these observations .",
    "similarly , there is no significant flux difference between the 1986 and 2003 observations , despite a large decrease in the bal strength , @xmath272   .",
    "the flux decrease between the 2003 and 2014 observations is only significant at @xmath273 but does correspond to a strengthening of the bal ( @xmath274   ) .",
    "the correlation between the observed uv flux and bal ew may not be as strong as expected as the flux is measured over @xmath161   . while this should give an indication of the uv flux variability , it is not directly measuring the unobservable euv range which would be responsible for any changes within the outflow .",
    "previous observations have shown the euv flux can vary more than the uv flux at longer wavelengths ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "if a change in the ionizing continuum is the main contributor to the bal variability , we might expect to see co - ordinated variations in the mini - bal .",
    "this feature is centered on @xmath209   corresponding to an outflow velocity of @xmath275 which is over @xmath276 slower than parts of the bal trough .",
    "figure  [ fig : bal ] shows that the mini - bal in the 2003 _ hst _ spectrum is significantly weaker than in the other 3 spectra .",
    "this corresponds well to the bal which is also extremely weak in this spectrum .",
    "however , in general , this feature shows much less variability than the bal ; in particular there is no corresponding deepening in 1986 or 2014 when the bal is considerably stronger .",
    "this is likely due to the feature being more highly saturated , and therefore less susceptible to changes in the ionizing continuum , but may also suggest that material is indeed physically distinct from the higher velocity bal and likely located much at a much greater distance from the central source .",
    "the 2014 bal trough shows a similar shape to the main bal trough in the 1986 spectrum , but is offset in wavelength .",
    "this could be due to an acceleration of the entire outflow of @xmath277 , which is consistent with accelerations observed in other bal quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in the standard model for bal quasars",
    "the wind properties should depend on the /uv sed and the properties of the shielding gas .",
    "indeed , bals are observed to be stronger and to have higher velocities in quasars with greater levels of x - ray absorption indicating that the shielding gas plays an important role in determining the properties of the outflowing wind @xcite . in pg  1004",
    "+ 130 the amount of absorption does not vary significantly with time , but despite this , large differences in the bal ew are created .",
    "this further suggests that the absorption we observe is not due to the typical shielding gas",
    ". the x - ray absorption could be due to the bal outflow itself .",
    "the presence of the ion in the uv material requires an ionization parameter in the range @xmath138@xmath278 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the values observed when the x - ray absorption is modeled with a partially ionized model ( see table  [ table : fits ] ) .",
    "we are unable to test for any relation between the flux and the ew of the uv bal as only 2 uv and observations were made at similar epochs . however , despite large differences in ew , the flux is similar in each case , suggesting no relationship .",
    "this is perhaps not unexpected as the observed emission in pg  1004 + 130 is likely mostly from a small - scale jet ( either because the continuum source is weak , or the normal continuum source is absorbed by compton - thick shielding gas ) .",
    "this flux may not be expected to influence the bal production strongly .",
    "+      emission from extended jets has now been detected in over 100 agn , but the physical processes involved in its production are still often uncertain .",
    "pg  1004 + 130 shows such emission , a knot , in the same direction as the se fri radio jet ; i.e. ,  at a pa of 130 located at a distance of 8 ( 30  kpc ) from the core .",
    "no are detected in relation to the nw frii radio counterjet , but this is not unusual ; the majority of detected jets are one - sided , with the corresponding to the brighter of the radio jets @xcite .",
    "the hymor radio nature is often interpreted as a difference in the environment on either side of the quasar ; i.e. ,  the jet propagating into a denser medium to the se is quickly decollimated giving the fri appearance , whereas the jet propagating to the nw through a more tenuous medium appears as an frii ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "shocks , created when the jet collides with an obstacle ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , accelerate electrons which then cool by emitting synchrotron and appear as bright knots .",
    "this scenario naturally explains why knots are commonly observed in fri jets @xcite as the probability of such shocks occurring is greater due to the higher density of the medium .",
    "some knots have shown exceptional variability , such as the knot in the jet of m87 which increased in intensity by 50% over 5  yrs @xcite .",
    "however , no evidence for variability was observed in the knots in cen  a @xcite , or in the quasar 3c  273 @xcite .",
    "although the knot in pg  1004 + 130 does not show substantial variability between the 2 _ chandra _ observations , the @xmath230 decrease in flux ( a factor of 2 in @xmath279 rest - frame years ) is consistent with electrons that have been excited in a shock and are cooling via synchrotron emission , with typical loss - times for such electrons being @xmath280 tens of yrs .",
    "expected power - law spectral indices for this synchrotron emission are @xmath281 @xcite , which steepen to @xmath282 when energy losses become more important . although we do not see a significant difference in the power - law slope between observations , largely owing to the low number of counts in the spectra and hence large errors on the parameter , the values we observe are broadly consistent with this scenario .",
    "however , the knot is spatially extended by 4 ( 15  kpc ) .",
    "since the loss - times of the electrons are too short for them to diffuse across this distance before emitting , the emission is likely being produced from a combination of multiple shock sites .",
    "this may explain why the flux decrease ( and @xmath25 increase ) is not highly significant , as we are observing the combined properties of these sites .",
    "we note that in alternative models for the emission such as beamed ic / cmb @xcite , no flux drop is expected as the typical loss - times for the lower - energy electrons involved are @xmath283  yrs .",
    "this scenario is also disfavored as the jet in pg  1004 + 130 is likely inclined at @xmath284 ( m06 ) implying little line - of - sight beaming .",
    "the peak of the knot emission lies closer to the core than the peak of the radio jet emission .",
    "offsets such as this are also commonly observed in other sources ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and are often explained as a single population of electrons cooling by emitting radiation at progressively lower frequencies from to radio as they propagate downstream along the jet @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario optical emission may be expected between the and radio peaks , but this is not observed in _ hst _ imaging of pg  1004 + 130 @xcite .",
    "this perhaps indicates that the and radio emission instead originate from different electron populations .",
    "the deeper combined exposure time of both _",
    "observations allows us to further constrain the nature of the diffuse emission which was previously observed in m06 .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] ( bottom right ) shows some of this emission extending to a radial distance of 65 ( 250  kpc ) from the core to the se , underlying the same area in which the broad fri radio emission is observed , which includes both the jet and the lobe .",
    "similar emission is observed to the nw , although it only extends to 55 ( 210  kpc ) and hence does not trace the location of the frii lobe which is located further from the quasar .",
    "this suggests that the diffuse emission in pg  1004 + 130 is more closely related to the radio jet emission , rather than the lobes .",
    "the possible detection of a radio counterjet on small scales ( c.  c.  cheung , 2014 , private communication ) also agrees with this interpretation .",
    "spectra of the diffuse emission , extracted from the green wedges shown on figure  [ fig : images ] ( bottom right ) , are well - fit with a power law .",
    "this suggests that non - thermal processes are responsible for the diffuse emission , a likely origin being unbeamed ic / cmb .",
    "the diffuse emission is stronger to the se ( @xmath247 ) than the nw ( @xmath251 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the distribution of colder gas implied by the hymor nature of pg  1004 + 130 , which is likely responsible for the stronger radio jet to the se and the weaker counterjet to the nw .",
    "electrons produced in the ic / cmb model are of a relatively low energy , and hence have lifetimes of @xmath283  yrs allowing them to travel large distances before emitting .",
    "the diffuse emission could therefore have an origin related to the jet and counterjet , but be located surrounding the radio jet as observed .",
    "we have presented new _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ hst _ cos observations of the rl bal quasar pg  1004 + 130 .",
    "we have compared these to archival and uv data in order to investigate potential changes in the and uv absorption , and in the jet .",
    "we also combine both _",
    "chandra _ observations creating a deeper exposure with which to investigate the nature of the x - ray jet and diffuse x - ray emission in more detail than previously possible .",
    "we summarize our main results below .    1 .",
    "the amount of intrinsic absorption present in pg  1004 + 130 does not appear to vary significantly between each of the 4 _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations . in each case",
    ", the absorption can be well modeled with a partially covering absorber , or a partially ionized absorber ( best - fitting spectral parameters are listed in table  [ table : fits ] ) . the low column densities , @xmath0  @xmath1 for a fully covering absorber , and lack of variability suggest that the absorption may not be due to the typical shielding gas invoked in quasar - wind models .",
    "see sections  [ section : fitting ] and  [ section : disc_abs ] .",
    "the flux of pg  1004 + 130 varies by up to @xmath285 over 612  days ( observed frame ; see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) , but remains at least a factor of @xmath286 weaker than is expected for a typical rl quasar with a similar uv and radio luminosity . as the source does not show significant variability in the amount of absorption present , these changes are more likely related to intrinsic variations within the continuum source itself , or fluctuations in the jet .",
    "see sections  [ section : lightcurve ] and  [ section : disc_abs ] .",
    "a strong bal is observed in our new 2014 _ hst _ cos observation , with @xmath287   .",
    "this is significantly variable , with an absolute change of @xmath274   and a fractional change of @xmath3 from the previous 2003 _ hst _ stis observation , 3183  days earlier in the rest - frame of pg  1004 + 130 .",
    "while the absolute change in ew is not exceptional , the fractional change is one of the highest observed in a bal quasar .",

    "it has a spatial extent of @xmath6 ( 15  kpc ) .",
    "its spatial and spectral properties are consistent with synchrotron emission from populations of shock - heated electrons .",
    "no similar counterpart to the frii counterjet is detected .",
    "see sections  [ section : jet ] and  [ section : disc_diff ] .",
    "asymmetric diffuse emission is detected around pg  1004 + 130 , with a lower luminosity underlying the unseen counterjet to the nw ( @xmath251 ) than the detected jet to the se ( @xmath247 ) . in both cases a thermal model for the emission",
    "is disfavored and a non - thermal origin , possibly due to inverse compton scattering of cmb photons , is more likely .",
    "the se emission has a best - fitting power - law slope of @xmath244 , consistent with the value for the nw emission , @xmath248 . in both cases ,",
    "the intensity of the emission decreases relatively smoothly , radially from the central source ( see figure  [ fig : radial ] , bottom ) .",
