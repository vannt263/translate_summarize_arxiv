    "there have been many studies on effects of noises in dynamical systems with delays .",
    "complex behavior due to noise and delay is found in many systems such as biological systems , signal transmissions , electrical circuits and lasers .",
    "systems with both noises and delay are commonly described by stochastic delay differential equations ( sddes ) . in recent years",
    ", linear sddes of langevin equation are beginning to gain much attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the parameter range for the stationary solutions of the langevin equation has been examined with the use of the step by step method @xcite , the moment mothod @xcite and the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) method @xcite@xcite .",
    "when we pay our attention to living brains , various kinds of noises are reported to be ubiquitous .",
    "a study on noise effects has been one of major recent topics in neuronal systems .",
    "it has been shown that the response of neurons may be improved by background noises .",
    "the typical example is the stochastic resonance in which weak noises enhance the transmission of signals with the subthreshold level .",
    "the transmission delay is inherent because the speed of spikes propagating through axons is finite .",
    "conduction velocity ranges from 20 to 60 m / s , leading to non - negligible transmission times from milliseconds to hundreds milliseconds .",
    "although an importance of effects of delay has been not so recognized as that of noises , there is an increasing interest in the complex behavior of time delays , whose effects have been investigated by using integrate - and - fire ( if ) @xcite-@xcite , fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) @xcite-@xcite , hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) @xcite , and hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) models @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite . exposed behaviors due to time delays are the multistability and bifurcation leading to chaos .",
    "there are two difficulties in studying combined effects of noise and delay in brains .",
    "one is that the system is usually described by _ nonlinear _ sddes , which are generally more difficult than linear sddes .",
    "dynamics of individual neurons includes a variety of voltage dependent ionic channels which can be described by nonlinear des of hodgkin - huxley - type models , or of reduced neuron models such as if , fn and hr models .",
    "the other difficulty is that a small cluster of cortex consists of thousands of similar neurons . for a study of dynamics of noisy neuron ensembles with time - delayed couplings",
    ", we have to solve high - dimensional nonlinear sddes , which have been studied by direct simulations ( dss ) @xcite @xcite and by analytical methods like fpe @xcite .",
    "simulations for large - scale neuron ensembles have been made mostly by using if , fn , hr and phase models . since the time to simulate networks by conventional methods grows as @xmath4 with @xmath0 , the size of the ensemble , it is rather difficult to simulate realistic neuron clusters .",
    "although fpe is a powerful method in dealing with the stochastic de , a simple fpe application to sdde fails because of its non - markovian property @xcite@xcite .    in a preceding paper @xcite ( which is referred to as i hereafter )",
    ", the present author has developed an augmented moment method ( amm ) for sdde , employing a semi - analytical dynamical mean - field approximation ( dma ) theory @xcite@xcite . in i",
    ", amm is applied to an ensemble described by the delay langevin model , transforming the original @xmath0-dimensional sddes to infinite - dimensional des which are terminated at finite level @xmath2 in the level-@xmath2 amm ( amm@xmath2 ) .",
    "model calculations in i with changing the level @xmath2 have shown that calculated results converge at a fairly small @xmath2 .",
    "actually results obtained by amm6 are in good agreement with those by dss for linear and nonlinear langevin ensembles .",
    "it has been demonstrated in i that amm may be a useful tool in discussing dynamics and synchronization of ensembles described by sddes .",
