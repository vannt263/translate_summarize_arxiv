    "nonequilibrium nanoscopic systems having discrete electronic states @xcite currently attract unflagging attention of researches from both experimental and theoretical sides because of practical applications in various electronic devices . besides , such systems also provide a unique platform for fundamental science since they represent a plexus of different fields of physics leading to new complex and highly nontrivial physical scenario .    a particularly interesting physics arises when both electron - electron interactions and nonequilibrium significantly contribute to the state of a nanoscopic system .",
    "the system s differential conductance , as is well known , may then enhance @xcite and exceed the value it would have without electronic correlations .",
    "this enhancement , taking place at low temperatures , signifies appearance of new physics due to the system s transition into a resonant many - particle kondo regime discovered first in the context of magnetic alloys @xcite .",
    "the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite is one of the main theoretical paradigms which is able to capture basic physics of nonequilibrium interacting nanoscopic systems .",
    "it describes a quantum dot ( qd ) with a single spin - degenerate level coupled to two fermionic contacts .",
    "the contacts have different chemical potentials with the difference specifying the voltage applied to the qd .",
    "this voltage is the source of nonequilibrium .",
    "quantum transport theories built upon siam can be divided into two classes : 1 ) operator based theories and 2 ) field integral based theories . within the first class one",
    "directly uses the second quantized operators while within the second class one transforms these operators into fields whose dynamics is governed by a certain effective action .    among numerous examples of the first class theories",
    "are perturbation theories in the electron - electron interaction @xcite as well as in the tunneling amplitude @xcite , noncrossing approximation @xcite , equations of motion @xcite , mean - field approximation @xcite , renormalization group theories @xcite . at the same time",
    "the relatively new second class is not so wide since field integral concepts in physics of nonequilibrium interacting nanoscopic systems are just on the way of growing emergence . here",
    "examples are given by analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite keldysh field integral theories .",
    "the anderson impurity model has two distinct fixed points , the weak coupling fixed point and the strong coupling or kondo fixed point , each one being a fermi liquid @xcite .    analytical field",
    "integral oriented theories are mainly based on slave - particle @xcite strong coupling fixed point approaches .",
    "for example in ref .",
    "the saddle point analysis is applicable at temperatures below the kondo temperature @xmath0 and thus the unitary limit is within its temperature range .",
    "however , being a @xmath1 expansion it gives an incorrect value of the conductance maximum for spin-@xmath2 . in refs .",
    "the effective keldysh action is expanded around the zero slave - bosonic field configuration up to the second order in the slave - bosonic fields and this restricts those theories to temperature range close to and above @xmath0 .",
    "these examples show that either the unitary limit is incorrectly described quantitatively or it can not be reached at all due to temperature limitations of theories . however , it is desirable to have a field integral theory treating the unitary limit properly since this limit gets more and more feasible in modern experiments @xcite both for the strong coupling and weak coupling fixed points regimes .",
    "a practical guide for developing a second class theory having a proper treatment of the unitary limit in the weak coupling fixed point regime is given by the first class theories , namely perturbation theories being expansions in powers of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "indeed , these theories @xcite are applicable at zero temperature and reproduce the correct value of the conductance maximum , @xmath3 .",
    "this gives one the cue that in the context of the field integration a theory valid at zero temperature and having the correct unitary limit might be obtained through the expansion of its effective action in powers of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "of course , such an expansion of the effective action means also an expansion in powers of a certain field .",
    "this field turns out to be non - unique and its choice is not obvious a priori . at",
    "this stage one usually relies upon various physical motivations which could simplify mathematical formulation and achieve physical clarity .    in this paper",
    "we choose this field as the hubbard - stratonovich field decoupling the electronic correlations in their spin channel .",
    "this means that such a magnetization field is sensitive to the qd spin fluctuations induced by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "since it has a magnetic origin it is also susceptible to the qd magnetic properties . in particular , when the magnetic symmetry is violated , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the presence of a magnetic field , either directly applied to the qd or indirectly induced in the qd by the ferromagnetic contact proximity effect , the minimum of the effective keldysh action moves from the zero magnetization field configuration and the new extremum provides the effective magnetic field experienced by the qd electron dynamics . on the contrary , in the absence of any magnetic structure the effective keldysh action simplifies admitting only even powers of the magnetization field .    in general the effective keldysh action is a nonlinear functional of the magnetization field .",
    "here we expand it up to the second order in this field , which is also a second order expansion in the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the quadratic model is an expansion about the weak coupling fixed point , where the saddle - point magnetization vanishes .",
    "thus such a theory must reproduce the unitary limit because it is an expansion about a fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "therefore , the goal of the present research is to develop a quadratic spin channel keldysh field integral formalism to provide an alternative theoretical tool for investigation of weakly correlated nonequilibrium nanosystems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ qdsc ] introduces the spin channel in the single impurity anderson hamiltonian while section [ sckfi ] converts it into the keldysh field integral framework and provides the general form of the effective keldysh action as a functional of the hubbard - stratonovich classical and quantum magnetization fields . in section [ scekatdos ]",
    "this action is expanded up to the second order in the magnetization fields and afterwards it is used to obtain the qd tunneling density of states .",
    "finally , the results are shown in section [ res ] and with section [ concl ] we conclude .",
    "we first formulate the problem on the operator level and prepare at this stage for its subsequent field integral formulation in the qd spin channel .",
    "the single impurity anderson hamiltonian reads , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the qd creation and annihilation electronic operators , @xmath8 is the qd energy level and @xmath9 is the strength of the electron - electron interaction in the qd .",
    "the contacts are fermionic noninteracting reservoirs described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the contact set of quantum numbers including the contacts label , @xmath12 ( left and right contacts ) , @xmath13 are the contacts creation and annihilation operators and @xmath14 identifies the contacts single - particle energies .",
    "the contacts are in equilibrium described by the fermi - dirac distributions , @xmath15 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath16 are the contacts chemical potentials , defining the voltage applied to the qd as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the contacts temperature which is assumed to be the same in the left and right contacts .",
    "the qd and contacts interact through a tunneling coupling given by the tunneling hamiltonian , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the tunneling matrix elements .    in order to construct a field integral in the qd spin channel one",
    "has to rewrite the qd hamiltonian in such a way that the coupling to the qd electron spin variable becomes apparent .",
    "this can be achieved , _",
    "e.g. _ , using the following equality @xmath21 as a result the qd hamiltonian acquires the form explicitly involving the qd electron spin degree of freedom , @xmath22    the qd hamiltonian in the form of eq .",
    "( [ siam_sc_ham ] ) together with eqs .",
    "[ cont_ham ] and [ tun_ham ] constitute a nonequilibrium interacting problem with the full hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "the explicit presence of the qd electron spin in the operator formulation allows one to introduce within the keldysh field integral framework classical and quantum fields directly connected to the qd spin channel dynamics , as it is shown in the next section .",
    "an equality similar to eq .",
    "( [ sc_eq ] ) has been utilized @xcite to explore quantum critical phenomena , in particular itinerant magnetic phases , using a field integral in the imaginary ( or matsubara ) time formulation .",
    "the field integral in that approach is obtained by integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom and obtaining an effective action as a functional of the hubbard - stratonovich field decoupling the spin channel .",
    "it turns out that such a hubbard - stratonovich field has a physical meaning of magnetization and it is sensitive to magnetic properties of systems .    in the same spirit , using real time and integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom , one arrives at the keldysh field integral @xcite for siam in the qd spin channel .    here before integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom the action is identical to the one in eq . ( 6 ) of ref . .",
