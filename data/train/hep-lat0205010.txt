    "the only way to study a quantum field theory non - perturbatively from first principles is via lattice regularization . for a strongly - interacting theory like qcd ,",
    "many essential features are non - perturbative .",
    "over the course of more than two decades , lattice qcd has determined , with varying degrees of accuracy , the hadron mass spectra , quark masses , the strong interaction coupling constant , low - energy constants , inter - particle potentials , the phase structure of the theory , decay constants , matrix elements and many other quantities @xcite . to make lattice qcd into a precise science",
    "requires detailed study of the systematic error introduced by the lattice discretization .",
    "as observed recently in a study of the @xmath1 non - linear sigma model @xcite , assumptions about how to extrapolate lattice results to the continuum may be wrong .",
    "even for very accurate lattice measurements , large deviations as the lattice spacing @xmath2 is varied could mean large uncertainty in continuum quantities , due to the extrapolation ansatz . to reduce such sensitivity",
    ", many groups now use e.g.  @xmath3-improved lattice actions to remove the leading order lattice artifacts .",
    "however , it may still be necessary to go to very fine resolution before the continuum extrapolation can be done confidently .",
    "a separate issue is that , for a long time , it was thought impossible to have chiral lattice fermions @xcite .",
    "this prevented a clean study of the chiral aspects of qcd , such as spontaneous symmetry breaking , and caused several technical headaches , such as fine - tuning the bare quark mass to make the pions light , exceptional configurations , mixing of operators with different chiral representations and additional renormalization factors .",
    "the question was also raised whether a chiral theory , such as the standard model , could in principle be defined non - perturbatively . the domain wall fermions @xcite , the related overlap construction @xcite and the fixed - point ( fp ) action @xcite are the known examples for lattice regularized fermions with chiral symmetry .",
    "the common feature behind these rather different constructions is the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) relation @xcite which is satisfied by all these constructions @xcite .",
    "actually , one might construct a dirac operator using directly the gw relation and the requirement of locality @xcite .",
    "the gw relation not only implies all the physical consequences of chiral symmetry @xcite , but also the existence of an exact symmetry transformation @xcite .",
    "this has caused an explosion of interest in the last few years in theory @xcite and in using different methods to explore the chiral behavior of quenched qcd ( no sea quarks ) , which is now quickly maturing . with the standardly used algorithms , it is impossible to use chiral lattice actions for simulations of full qcd ( with sea quarks ) , as these actions have a complicated structure @xcite .",
    "this is the major obstacle for the future use of chiral actions .",
    "for a recent promising development see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fixed - point method is motivated by renormalization group properties of lattice field theories @xcite . instead of trying to remove lattice artifacts order by order in the lattice spacing @xmath2 , a fixed - point ( fp ) action",
    "is designed to be less sensitive to the discretization even at large lattice spacings .",
    "in fact , for some quantities , a fp action is entirely blind to the discretization .",
    "an exact fp qcd action has exact chiral symmetry and offers a completely new approach to examine the chiral properties of the theory .",
    "exact and approximate fixed - point actions have been constructed and tested for a number of models , including pure yang - mills theory , and in general have shown very good scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "the construction and initial tests of an approximate fixed - point dirac operator @xmath0 are described in @xcite . like other chiral actions ,",
    "fixed - point actions are more costly to use in simulations than standard actions .",
    "however , fp actions are designed to have much reduced lattice artifacts and , if chiral actions are the correct long - term approach for lattice",
    "qcd , fp actions might be the optimal choice .    in this paper , we present the results of a preliminary study of an approximate fp qcd action , to test if it is feasible to use such an action in simulations . a larger systematic study , which is running already as part of the program of the bern - graz - regensburg collaboration , is required to examine the lattice spacing dependence of measurements using this action ( see ref .",
    "as well as these initial measurements , we also give a practical method to construct and use conserved currents in simulations with chiral lattice actions .",
    "many groups now use chiral actions , but non - conserved currents and/or non - covariant densities and so lose part of the advantages offered by a chiral formulation .",
    "this paper is a detailed description of the work summarized in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , we examine how small chiral deviations of the action can be corrected .",
    "hadron spectroscopy measurements with the parametrized fp dirac operator are described in section 3 , giving the pion , rho and nucleon masses , the speed of light , the remnant additive quark mass renormalization and an indication of the presence of quenched chiral logarithms . in section 4 , we use the overlap - improved fp dirac operator to measure the meson spectrum , the renormalized quark condensate via finite - size scaling , the quenched topological susceptibility , investigate random matrix theory and small eigenvalue distributions on small lattice volumes , and examine instanton - dominance of near - zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "the construction of covariant currents and densities and a discussion of ward identities for chiral lattice actions are given in section 5 , followed by our conclusions .",
    "in the appendix we collect some useful identities which are implied by the ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "a dirac operator @xmath5 which satisfies exactly the ginsparg - wilson relation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is any local function and trivial in dirac space , has exact chiral symmetry even at non - zero lattice spacing @xmath2 .",
    "such a dirac operator has infinitely many couplings @xcite .",
    "simulations are only feasible with a finite number of couplings , hence the chiral symmetry is only approximate .",

    "the parametrized fixed - point dirac operator @xmath0 , which we use in simulations , is an approximate solution to the qcd fixed - point equations .",

    ", the function @xmath8 can be absorbed into the definition of @xmath5 , so for simplicity , we set @xmath9 in most of the following equations",
    ". the ginsparg - wilson relation can be re - written as @xmath10 using the property @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath5 satisfies this relation , its complex eigenvalues lie on the circle of radius 1 and centre at ( 1,0 ) in the complex plane . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gwcircle ] , we plot the complex eigenvalues of @xmath0 for fixed - point gauge action @xmath12 configurations .",

    "the figure contains all the eigenvalues for @xmath18 gauge configurations and those closest to the origin for @xmath19 configurations .",
    "it s clear that the breaking of the ginsparg - wilson relation is small over the entire eigenvalue spectrum even though the lattice spacing is quite coarse , and that the chiral symmetry remains very good even for larger volumes . for comparison ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the wilson dirac operator @xmath20 at a similar lattice spacing are very far removed from the ginsparg - wilson circle @xcite .",
    "defining the operator @xmath21 , the ginsparg - wilson relation is equivalent to the requirement that @xmath22 be unitary i.e.  @xmath23 .",
    "we can measure how much this requirement is broken by finding the smallest and largest eigenvalues of @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : adaggera ] , we plot the ratio of the 50 smallest eigenvalues of @xmath24 to the largest eigenvalue for a number of @xmath12 gauge configurations with a lattice spacing @xmath25 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue is approximately 1.5 and 38 for @xmath0 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "we see that the fixed - point operator is much closer than the wilson operator to satisfying the unitarity condition . also , as the volume increases , it s more likely that using @xmath0 produces a few very small eigenvalues , but the vast bulk of the @xmath24 spectrum is close to 1 .    for some measurements ,",
    "it s necessary that the remnant chiral symmetry breaking be very small .",
    "given any suitable dirac operator @xmath26 as input , the overlap dirac operator @xcite @xmath27 is an exact solution of the ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "the real parameter @xmath28 can be used to optimize the convergence of approximations or the locality of the resulting overlap dirac operator .",
    "the nice feature of this operator is that it s an explicit construction , unlike the fixed - point operator which is a solution to a set of equations . if the input operator @xmath26 is already chiral , then @xmath29 and hence @xmath30 .",
    "most simulations using @xmath31 have taken @xmath20 as the input operator , which has severely broken chiral symmetry , as @xmath24 is far from 1 and hence computing @xmath32 is a very expensive numerical problem .",
    "a measure of this difficulty is the condition number of @xmath24 , the ratio of its smallest to largest eigenvalue . also , the overlap operator may inherit the large lattice artifacts of @xmath20 . alternatively , taking @xmath0 as the input operator , @xmath24 is close to 1 and @xmath32 is easier to evaluate  the improvement in the condition number is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : adaggera ] .",
    "the overlap construction should only bring small corrections to @xmath0 .",
    "this way , the residual chiral symmetry breaking can be removed without destroying the very important fixed - point properties .",
    "as the chiral symmetry is already well approximated by @xmath0 , we use a legendre polynomial approximation of @xmath32 to construct the overlap - improved operator @xmath33 . as @xmath24",
    "may occasionally have a few very small eigenvalues , we always project out the smallest 10 to 100 eigenvalues , which are treated exactly . one measure of the remnant chiral symmetry breaking is the vector norm @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a unit vector of random entries . if @xmath5 solves the ginsparg - wilson relation , @xmath36 vanishes . in fig .",

    "the chiral symmetry breaking falls off exponentially as the polynomial order increases .",
    "the rate of the fall off varies depending on the range of the @xmath24 eigenvalues which are not projected out . projecting out the same number of @xmath43 eigenvalues for the different lattice spacings , the rate of the fall off is the largest for the smallest lattice spacing .",
    "however , choosing the number of projected @xmath24 eigenvalues such that ratio @xmath44 for the remaining @xmath24 eigenvalues is approximately the same for the three different lattice spacings , the rate of the fall off is roughly equal for all the lattice spacings , which illustrates that the convergence rate is indeed governed by the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "if the eigenvalues @xmath45 of @xmath5 lie exactly on the ginsparg - wilson circle , then @xmath46 are purely imaginary i.e.  the eigenvalues are projected from the circle onto the imaginary axis . in fig .",

    "as the order increases , @xmath47 becomes exponentially small as the eigenvalues @xmath45 lie closer and closer to the ginsparg - wilson circle , with the most rapid decrease at the finest lattice spacing .",
    "a lattice action must be local for its continuum predictions to be universal i.e.  independent of the choice of lattice discretization .",
    "locality on the lattice means that fields at large separation have an exponentially small coupling .",

    "in contrast to @xmath56 there is no tuning of the parameter @xmath28 needed for @xmath60 to get the ( approximately ) optimal locality , i.e.we can use  @xmath61 for @xmath60 .    from these tests ,",
    "we see that the chiral symmetry is well approximated by @xmath0 and that the residual breaking can be removed using overlap - improvement .",
    "only a relatively low order polynomial approximation is required to construct @xmath33 , which is essential as @xmath0 is more expensive to use than @xmath20 .",
    "the parametrized fp operator has 9 times more offsets and the computational cost per offset is also higher since @xmath0 includes all elements of the clifford algebra .",
    "if , in a matrix - vector multiplication , for @xmath20 the time needed for dirac matrix multiplications is neglected , then @xmath0 is a factor of @xmath62/offset more expensive leading to an estimated relative overhead of @xmath63 .",
    "note , however , that this number may vary quite a bit depending on the underlying computer architecture , as one of the main issues in present lattice simulations is rather fast memory access and fast communication than fast floating point units @xcite .",

    "mass spectroscopy in quenched qcd with chiral fermions is quickly maturing and is a very good test of the chiral behavior of the theory . in this preliminary study , we test the behavior of @xmath0 , for example , how intact are the fixed - point properties , how large is the additive quark mass renormalization , how small an @xmath64 ratio can be attained and do we observe quenched chiral logarithms .",
