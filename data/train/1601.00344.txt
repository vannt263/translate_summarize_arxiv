    "it is now well known that supermassive black holes ( sbh ) are present in the centers of massive galaxies @xcite and share interesting correlations with the host galaxy properties such as the velocity dispersion @xcite , bulge mass @xcite , bulge luminosity @xcite and galaxy light concentration @xcite .",
    "these empirical correlations suggest that the growth of the central sbh and the host galaxy are fundamentally interlinked .",
    "agn feedback may be responsible for the correlations observed @xcite , although it has also been argued that the origin of the observed relations is entirely non - causal and is a natural consequence of merger driven galaxy growth @xcite .",
    "the energy released from the central sbh is several orders more than the binding energy of massive galaxies @xcite .",

    "all these show the negative effect of agn feedback by removing / heating up the gas and eventually suppressing the star formation and regulating the galaxy growth . however , several other theoretical studies @xcite have reported an increased star formation rate in agn especially at high redshifts via induced pressure by jets / winds . all this evidence",
