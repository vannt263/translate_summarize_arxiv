    "in this article we want to describe the thermodynamic evolution of the standard model particles in the early universe .",
    "we will focus on two main events after the electroweak transition at @xmath5 gev @xcite : the freeze out of wimps between 40 gev and 400 mev @xcite and in more detail the cosmic qcd transition at @xmath6 mev @xcite .",
    "all standard model particles can be described as a particle fluid in chemical equilibrium .",
    "this excellent approximation holds because all interaction rates are much larger then the hubble rate @xmath7 . within the hubble time",
    "@xmath8 particles get created and destroyed so fast , that the chemical equilibrium is always fulfilled for @xmath9 few mev .",
    "all particle interactions conserve charge- , baryon- and lepton flavour number .",
    "since our universe is charge neutral @xcite , the sum of all charged particles has to be zero .",
    "we know further from big bang nucleosythesis or the wmap measurements , that in our universe are slightly more baryons then anti baryons .",
    "the difference in their densities normalized with the entropy density @xmath10 is measured as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "things are more difficult for the lepton flavour number . in the temperature region of our interest , 200 gev @xmath12 few mev , each lepton flavour is conserved .",
    "neutrino oscillations would violate this assumption , but they become sufficient at much lower temperatures @xmath13 .",
    "the lepton flavour density is defined as @xmath14 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the net number density of the charged lepton flavour and @xmath19 the one of the neutrinos .",
    "the latter one is unknown and it might be , that the asymmetry between neutrinos and anti neutrinos is orders of magnitude larger then @xmath20 . from big bang nucleosythesis , the cosmic microwave background and the large scale structure we only know @xmath21 for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this assumes the asymmetry to be equal in all flavours @xmath23 . for @xmath24",
    "this does not necessarily hold .",
    "it was shown that initial different flavour asymmetries equilibrate due to the neutrino oscillations @xcite before big bang nucleosynthesis . a scenario with asymmetries for example like @xmath25 but",
    "@xmath26 would be possible @xcite and in no contradiction to experimental data @xcite .    leaving the lepton flavour asymmetries as free parameters",
    ", we can set up the following system of 5 equations for the evolution of the standard model particles in the early universe : @xmath27 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , the baryon number @xmath28 of species @xmath29 , and @xmath30 the charge of species @xmath29 . in a friedman - lemaitre - robertson - walker universe the net number density of a particle @xmath29 and its antiparticle @xmath31 with chemical potential @xmath32 at a temperature @xmath33 is given by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 counts the degrees of freedom of the particle and the integral over the energy @xmath36 runs from the mass @xmath37 to infinity .",
    "the @xmath38 depends on the statistics : @xmath39 for bosons and @xmath40 for fermions . for fermions",
    "this can be approached to @xmath41 the chemical potentials of all particles in chemical equilibrium can be expressed by five independent , e.g. @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for details see @xcite . for a given temperature we solved ( [ lf ] ) to ( [ charge ] ) for any lepton flavour asymmetry . with the calculated chemical potentials we calculated the energy density of each particle , given by @xmath44",
    "if the cooling universe reaches @xmath45 the energy becomes too low to create the particle @xmath29 and it annihilates .",
    "the effective degrees of freedom @xmath46 of the particle fluid gets reduces by the number of effective degrees of freedom of the annihilating particle .",
    "the definition of the @xmath46 is @xmath47 a more detailed discussion can be found for instance in @xcite . in the following chapter we present our results for temperatures around the qcd transition for the case of",
    "equal distributed flavour asymmetries @xmath48 .",
    "another interesting scenario is the influence of @xmath49 with @xmath50 on the degrees of freedom , which is presented in chapter 3 .",
    "we conclude our results in chapter 4 .",
    "the standard model of particle physics predicts a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry of the qcd .",
    "this leads to a phase transition at a certain temperature @xmath51 where quarks confine to hadrons .",
    "one would like to have a phase diagram to locate the different states of matter . such a phase diagram would than be spanned by the temperature and the baryo chemical potential @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately the calculations for such a diagram from first principles are extraordinary difficult @xcite . so far",
    "a combination of results from perturbative calculations , heavy ion collisions and lattice simulations lead to the diagram in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .    ) .",
    "the temperature of the transition is @xmath53 mev @xcite .",
    "the trajectory of the universe has to start at high temperatures in the quark phase and end at @xmath54 , the nucleon mass in the hadron phase.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    for the evolution of the early universe the cosmic qcd transition is of crucial interest for our understanding of the early universe .",
    "one would like to have more knowledge about how quarks confine to hadrons , since it sets for example the starting conditions for one of the pillars of cosmology , the big bang nucleosynthesis . depending on the order of the transition",
    "there might be several today observable relics like quark nuggets , magnetic fields , and the modification of the primordial background of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "if the transition was of first order , the universe might have undergone a second period of inflation , suggested by @xcite .",
    "we want to review here our results on the effect of leptons on the transition @xcite and show , how they change figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "each of the five conserved quantum numbers @xmath20 , @xmath3 , and @xmath55 in equations ( [ lf ] ) to ( [ charge ] ) can be associated with a chemical potential , @xmath52 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , which can be expressed by the chemical potentials of the standard model particles @xcite . to get an estimate of the @xmath58 and @xmath20 dependence of the chemical potentials we assume for @xmath59 up , down , charm and strange quarks and the leptons massless . solving equations",
    "( [ lf ] ) to ( [ charge ] ) with ( [ nirel ] ) leads to @xmath60 if the total lepton asymmetry @xmath58 is orders of magnitudes larger , it becomes the dominant factor for all three chemical potentials .",
    "the order of @xmath52 is then given by the order of @xmath58 .",
    "we see also , that the chemical potentials can get negative , depending on the sign of @xmath58 . for temperatures below pion mass shell",
    "we get for the baryo chemical potential the following estimates : @xmath61,\\ ] ] with @xmath62 .",
    "independent of @xmath58 all trajectories for the baryo chemical potential are unique for @xmath63 mev . all effects are shown in our full numerical calculations in figures [ fig : mub ] and [ fig : mule ] . for these pictures we calculated ( [ lf ] ) to ( [ charge ] ) with net particle densities ( [ ni ] ) for all standard model particles including their physical masses .",
    "in this chapter we want to give a brief introduction to the influence of large individual lepton flavour asymmetries on the relic abundance of wimps .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .    in the following we assume the dark matter to be a single component wimp with no asymmetry between wimps and anti wimps . these particles with masses",
    "@xmath64 typically between 10 gev and 1 tev decouple chemically from the standard model particles between 40 gev @xmath65 gev @xcite depending on their mass . after this freeze out",
    "the wimps only react kinetically with the standard model particles .",
    "their relic abundance y can be approximated by @xcite @xmath66 @xmath67 is the planck mass , @xmath68 the total cross section and @xmath69 the velocity of the annihilating particles .",
    "the index @xmath70 indicates the freeze out time and @xmath71 .",
    "the relic abundance depends on the relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath46 of the standard model particle ensemble .",
    "any few percent effect ( [ gast ] ) would lead to a few percent effect in the relic abundance of the wimps . to get an analytic approximation of of the @xmath3 dependence of ( [ gast ] )",
    "we take all particles massless and get @xmath72 + 1}{\\rm d}e}\\\\ & = & \\sum_f \\frac{7}{4}g_f + \\frac{15}{2}g_f\\left(\\frac{\\mu_f}{\\pi t } \\right)^2 + \\frac{15}{4}g_f\\left(\\frac{\\mu_f}{\\pi t } \\right)^4 + \\sum_b g_b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the index @xmath73 denotes fermions and @xmath74 bosons .",
    "compared to the standard case where chemical potentials are neglected , we have additional @xmath75 if the fermion chemical potentials @xmath76 are @xmath77 , the effect becomes non negligible .",
    "if for example the asymmetry in the @xmath16- and @xmath17 neutrinos is of order unity , their chemical potentials would become that big .",
    "we calculated ( [ gast ] ) numerically for the full standard model and for a scenario where @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "if these asymmetries are in the neutrinos , values of @xmath81 are not in contradiction to theories @xcite nor to experiments @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations of @xmath82 for the whole set of standard model particles show a significant effect .     and @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath84 there is a significant deviation compared to the @xmath85 scenario .",
    "for @xmath86 we observe a more then 20@xmath87 effect.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "our knowledge of the relic neutrinos and the lepton asymmetries is still very poor and the possible effects of large lepton ( flavour ) asymmetries on the early universe have been overlooked so far .",
    "we investigated here the effect of large @xmath58 and @xmath3 for @xmath88 and found that large lepton ( flavour ) asymmetries do have an observable impact on the dynamics of the early universe .",
    "an asymmetry @xmath89 influences significantly the dynamics of the qcd transition @xcite .",
    "depending on the unknown phase structure of the qcd phase diagram in the @xmath90 plane and the position of the hypothetical critical end point , a large lepton asymmetry might result in a first order transition .",
    "this seems to be possible for @xmath91 .",
    "large lepton asymmetries determine the order of the baryo chemical potential .",
    "in general , @xmath52 is a function of both , the baryon and lepton asymmetry , @xmath92 .",
    "however , we have shown that the phase diagram for the cosmic qcd phase transition needs at least six dimensions , one for each chemical potential and the temperature .",
    "the structure of these phase diagrams needs further investigations , for instance the inclusion of interactions , to clarify the order .",
    "we have also introduced in this article the idea , that the unknown neutrino flavour asymmetries @xmath93 effect the relic abundance of the wimp dark matter . even if the total lepton asymmetry is of the same order as the baryon asymmetry @xmath94 , but individual flavour asymmetries @xmath95 , we observed a few percent effect .",
    "in our discussion of this work we did not include sterile neutrinos and in particular not their oscillations with active neutrinos .",
    "the inclusion would possibly weaken the constraints on the neutrino asymmetries in the early universe .",
