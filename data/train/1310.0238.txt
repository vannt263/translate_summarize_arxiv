    "in this note , we use the same model , discretization , and non - dimensionalization as @xcite , labelled b&s for brevity , but include the corrected equations , which are listed below .",
    "it is implied that the following errata refer to b&s .    1 .",
    "the analytical steady solution , @xmath3 ( appendix b , p. 54 ) , obtained by separation of variables , is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 the non - dimensional coordinates of the combustion domain are @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   the expressions for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( eq .  ( 7 ) , p. 36 ) are @xmath10 times the original terms due to galerkin projection ; and @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "3 .   the variable @xmath13 in the right - hand side of the terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( eq .  ( 13 ) , p. 37 ) is @xmath16 .",
    "4 .   @xmath17 ( eqs .  ( 18),(19 ) , p. 39 ) is to be divided by 2 due to non - dimensionalization over the cross - sectional area .",
    "the multiplying factor ahead matrix @xmath18 ( appendix b , p. 54 ) is @xmath19",
    "the expression of the matrix @xmath20 ( appendix b , p. 54 ) is @xmath21 , where @xmath22^t [ j_{00}\\;\\ldots\\;j_{0m}\\;0\\;\\ldots\\;0].\\ ] ] @xmath23 is the number of galerkin modes for acoustic discretization .",
    "the damping terms in the matrix @xmath24 ( appendix b , p. 55 ) are @xmath25 .",
    ".   the numerator of the matrix @xmath26 ( appendix b , p. 55 ) is 1 due to non - dimensionalization over the cross - sectional area of the duct .",
    "computations are performed by using @xmath27 galerkin modes in the flame domain , and 6 modes in the acoustic domain . when the number of galerkin modes is increased to @xmath28 in the flame and 12 in the acoustics , the eigenvalues and singular values",
    "change by less than @xmath29 .",
    "the fixed parameters are the fuel mass ratio , @xmath30 ; the oxidizer mass ratio , @xmath31 ; and the average temperature , @xmath32 .",
    "we set the damping coefficients to @xmath33 and @xmath34 in order to have marginally stable systems .",
    "the nonlinear behaviour of this thermo - acoustic system is not considered because it has been fully characterized by @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig:1]a , b show the growth factor , @xmath0 , as a function of the pclet number , @xmath35 , and the non - dimensional half width of the fuel slot , @xmath36 , respectively . in both cases , @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , marginally stable but highly non - normal fluid - dynamic systems exhibit pseudospectra that protrude significantly into the unstable half - plane @xcite . in this thermo - acoustic system , however , the pseudospectra around the most unstable eigenvalues are nearly concentric circles whose values decrease rapidly as the distance from the eigenvalue increases .",
    "this is a further demonstration that the system is only weakly non - normal .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that @xcite showed that even a small amount of non - normality can make a system somewhat more susceptible to triggering .",

    "<S> perturbations in a non - normal system can grow transiently even if the system is linearly stable . if this transient growth is sufficiently large , it can trigger self - sustained oscillations from small initial disturbances . </S>",
    "<S> this has important practical consequences for combustion - acoustic oscillations , which are a continual problem in rocket and aircraft engines . </S>",
    "<S> balasubramanian and sujith ( _ journal of fluid mechanics _ 2008 , 594 , 2957 ) modelled an infinite - rate chemistry diffusion flame in an acoustic duct and found that the transient growth in this system can amplify the initial energy by a factor , @xmath0 , of order @xmath1 to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent investigations by l. magri & m. p. juniper have brought to light certain errors in that paper . </S>",
    "<S> when the errors are corrected , @xmath0 is found to be of order 1 to 10 , revealling that non - normality is not as influential as it was thought to be . </S>"
