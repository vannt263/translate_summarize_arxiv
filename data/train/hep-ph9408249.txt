    "a possible signal for quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions is the enhancement of the production of strange particles .",
    "the original proposal by rafelski and mller @xcite was followed by extensive discussion in the literature @xcite . in this context thermal gluon decay",
    "has been recently discussed@xcite .",
    "it has been claimed recently that the process @xmath3 dominates for a wide range of quark masses @xcite .",
    "normally , the gluon can not decay into a strange quark - antiquark pair because its thermal mass is too low .",
    "even for the optimistic case where on takes the coupling constant @xmath4 in a plasma with two massless quarks , the gluon mass is given to lowest order in perturbation theory by @xmath5 for a temperature of @xmath6= 200 mev this gives @xmath7 mev which is below the threshold for the production of strange quarks .",
    "the important observation by altherr and seibert is that in addition to acquiring a thermal mass , gluons also acquire a width , determined by the large damping rate , of the order @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this is the reason why thermal gluon decay into a heavy quark - antiquark pair is allowed , even though the gluon mass is below the threshold for strange pair production .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic re - evaluation of the production rate of massive quarks in a quark - gluon plasma due to the processes of quark - antiquark annihilation , gluon fusion and thermal gluon decay in the spirit of altherr and seibert .",
    "since the production rate depends strongly on the damping rate we take a more conservative approach in its estimation .",
    "our main point is that even with the parameters chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite we can not support the claim that gluon decay is the dominant mechanism for strange quark production in a quark - gluon plasma . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the gluon fusion mechanism , originally proposed by rafelski and mller@xcite , remains the leading process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the properties of thermal - gluon propagators and the damping rate . in section 3",
    "we calculate the production rates . in section 4",
    "we present results and concluding remarks .",

    "the real transverse and longitudinal parts of the gluon self energy in the high temperature limit are respectively given by @xmath14,\\ ] ] and @xmath15 .\\ ] ] the positions of the poles in the propagator ( [ eq38a ] ) are determined by the dispersion relations @xmath16 if a pole is located at @xmath17 then the imaginary shift of the pole @xmath18 is related to the imaginary part of the self energy through @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the residue of the propagator given by @xmath21 or , explicitly in terms of @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 thus we can write ( [ eq38a ] ) as @xmath25 where we suppressed subscripts @xmath26 , i. e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 are either transverse or longitudinal . this expression will be used to replace the mass - shell @xmath29-function for thermal gluons .    the imaginary part of the pole in ( [ eq312 ] ) gives the damping rate of the plasma oscillations @xcite in the following we consider transverse gluons and we set @xmath30 .",
    "the damping rate is related to the so called gluon magnetic mass @xmath31 , or the inverse magnetic screening length at high temperature .",
    "unfortunately , the exact relation between @xmath28 and @xmath31 is not known .",
    "a closed expression for the damping rate has been derived by pisarski in the limit where @xmath32 @xcite : @xmath33 , \\ ] ] where the thermal gluon mass is given by @xmath34 the magnetic mass at high temperature is of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a number depending on the gauge group and can not be calculated by a perturbation expansion .",
    "lattice estimates @xcite for su(2 ) @xmath37 have been confirmed by recent semiclassical calculations @xcite .",
    "so far , no reliable estimate exists for su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the best one can do is extrapolate the su(2 ) value by @xcite @xmath38    expanding the log in ( [ eq31 ] ) in powers of @xmath39 and retaining only the leading terms one finds @xmath40 .\\ ] ] where @xmath41 if we keep the leading log term only . if the next - to - leading term is included then @xmath42 to check the consistency of pisarski s approximation we plot in fig [ gamma ] the damping rate for both values of @xmath43 as well as the damping rate used in @xcite and compare with @xmath31 .",
    "one can observe the poor validity of the approximation for small values of @xmath44 .",
    "the approximation is well justified if one uses the expression ( [ eq36 ] ) in the range @xmath45 .",
    "consider a quark - gluon plasma in which the gluons and the light quarks ( @xmath46 ) are in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the strange quarks too are in thermal equilibrium but away from chemical equilibrium having very large and negative chemical potential @xmath47 . the chemical reactions @xmath48",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 will then take place until chemical equilibrium is reached .",
    "the total production rate due to ( [ eq20a]-[eq20c ] ) , including the reversed processes , is given by @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 in our notation the four - momenta are denoted by capitals @xmath55 etc .",
    "the summation in the above equations extends over all colors and polarizations of the gluons and the final state quark - antiquark pair .",
    "we have included the pauli blocking factors although , as long as the density of strange quarks is well below one , pauli blocking does not play a significant role .",
    "following matsui , mclerran and svetitsky @xcite we can investigate the evolution process in terms of the relaxation time determined near equilibrium .",
    "therefore we have to evaluate the rates ( [ eq21a]-[eq21 ] ) at @xmath56 , i. e. when quarks are in both thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "thermal field theory calculations becomes fully legitimate in this way .",
    "in particular , we can use the thermal quark mass given by @xcite @xmath57 and the thermal gluon mass ( [ eq32 ] ) .",
    "the processes of gluon fusion and quark - antiquark annihilation have been discussed in ref @xcite and we shall use their expressions for ( [ eq21a],[eq21b ] ) .",
    "the thermal gluon decay , also discussed by altherr and seibert @xcite , can be calculated similarly .",
    "we first replace the integrations over @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 and change variables @xmath62 after trivially eliminating integrals over @xmath63 and @xmath64 we find @xmath65 where the integration space is restricted by the following kinematical constraints : @xmath66    it immediately follows that @xmath67 if @xmath68 . at the relevant temperatures the thermal gluon mass is not high enough to allow for decay into a strange quark pair .",
    "it is only because of its width that the gluon can decay . to take this into account",
    "the @xmath29-function is replaced by a function , similar to the breit - wigner resonance . in the case of a narrow resonance",
    "the width of the resonance is related to the imaginary shift of the pole in the propagator in the complex @xmath69 plane @xmath70 which in the limit @xmath71 yields the standard free particle propagator @xmath72 thus for a breit - wigner resonance with width @xmath73 the mass - shell @xmath29-function should be replaced by @xmath74 this simple prescription can not be directly applied to the case of thermal gluons because the location of the pole is determined by complicated dispersion relations ( [ eq311 ] ) for transverse ( t ) and longitudinal ( l ) gluons . due to ( [ eq315 ] ) , instead of ( [ eq25 ] ) , we use @xmath75 the matrix element is simply given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the polarization vector of the decaying gluon and @xmath78 are the su(3 ) matrices .    summing over colors and all polarizations of",

    ". the production rate due to the gluon decay is given by the sum @xmath83    if we neglect the pauli blocking factors the integral over @xmath84 can be done explicitly , leading to @xmath85 and a similar expression for @xmath82 .",
    "we use the full high temperature expressions for re@xmath86 given by ( [ eq33],[eq34 ] ) and numerically solve the dispersion relations ( [ eq311 ] ) in order to determine @xmath87 from ( [ eq314a],[eq314b ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependent gluon mass is given by ( [ eq32 ] ) and the damping rate @xmath88 is estimated using ( [ eq36 ] ) .",
    "the rates for diferent processes are depicted in fig [ rate1 ] and fig [ rate2 ] .",
    "our numerical calculation of the thermal gluon decay is done using equations ( [ eq29],[eq210 ] ) with ( [ eq39],[eq310],[eq314a],[eq314b ] ) and ( [ eq36 ] ) . the rates for quark - antiquark annihilation and gluon fusion we calculate by making use of equations ( 3.23 - 3.25 ) in ref @xcite .",
    "we fix the qcd coupling constant at the value @xmath4 because the temperature during the time evolution is almost constant and the runing coupling effect is negligable . in fig [ rate1 ] the quark mass",
    "is kept fixed while in fig [ rate2 ] it varies with temperature according to ( [ eq222 ] ) . in both cases",
    "we find that the gluon fusion together with the quark - antiquark annihilation , dominates almost everywhere .",
    "the gluon decay process is as large as the gluon fusion in the narrow region around @xmath89 only if we choose the optimistic @xcite parameterization of the damping rate .",
    "it has been shown that the time dependence of the strange - quark density can , to a great degree of accuracy , be described by the approximate evolution equation @xcite @xmath90 where the relaxation time is defined as @xmath91 with @xmath92 the derivative of @xmath93 with respect to @xmath94 at fixed energy density is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 all the quantities in ( [ eq42 ] ) are to be evaluated at @xmath56 . in fig",

    "we comment here on the various approximations made in the gluon decay calculation .",
    "first of all , use was made of the braaten - pisarski resummation scheme .",
    "this is strictly valid only when @xmath100 which is clearly not the case here .",
    "this is the case with most applications of qcd at finite temperatures .",
    "secondly the magnetic mass has been introduced although only very limited knowledge is available .",
    "it has been used to calculate the damping rate of a thermal gluon inside a plasma . in comparison to the calculations of references",
    "@xcite we keep the standard form of the breit - wigner distribution .",
    "the consequences of this is that the rate for high masses is reduced , while for low masses it is enhanced .",
    "we also avoid a rather heuristic assumption that the thermal quark mass is generated by gluons only .",
    "since our rates are defined near equilibrium our thermal mass includes both thermal gluon and thermal quark contribution .",
    "finally , a more accurate calculation of the gluon fusion process shows that the high mass approximation used in @xcite underestimates its contribution .",
    "our main point has been that even with the parameters chosen in ref.@xcite we do not support the claim that the gluon decay process is the dominant mechanism for strange quark production inside a quark - gluon plasma . to the best of our knowledge ,",
