    "the ability to direct millimeter waves into and out of a magnetically confined plasma is of great value in plasma research .",
    "one principal application is the detection of electron cyclotron emission ( ece ) to infer the electron temperature profile .",
    "@xcite this inference is permitted by two properties of tokamak plasmas : ( 1 ) the magnetic field in the plasma is non - uniform , scaling like @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance from the axis of symmetry of the torus .",
    "( 2 ) the electron temperature is proportional to the radiative temperature , a consequence of the tokamak plasma being a blackbody emitter in the ece range of frequencies .",
    "the ece frequency distribution over @xmath1 is determined primarily by the strength of the toroidal magnetic field at a given @xmath1 , with corrections for doppler and relativistic broadening @xcite . the magnetic field ( and , therefore",
    ", the electron cyclotron frequency ) in a tokamak is roughly inversely proportional to the major radius ; hence , electrons at smaller ( larger ) @xmath1 emit ece of higher ( lower ) frequency .",
    "the radiation can be spectrally analyzed by an ece diagnostic , typically located on the outside edge tokamak where the magnetic field is weakest . to achieve the best spatial resolution ,",
    "therefore , the diagnostic should receive the radiation through a focusing element whose focal length increases with frequency  in other words , the element should exhibit reverse chromatic aberration ( rca ) , a frequency dependence opposite to what is normally encountered in natural materials .    incorporating an optic with rca would have the potential to improve the quality of ece detection on the diii - d tokamak @xcite . in the current setup ,",
    "ece from the plasma is reflected off an ellipsoidal mirror on the low - field side of the tokamak , after which it is received by a scalar horn antenna connected to a 40-channel radiometer .",
    "the mirror has essentially the same focal length at all frequencies @xcite .",
    "the frequencies detected by the radiometer , however , are emitted from a range of major radii that differ by up to 0.85 m and vary with toroidal field strength .",
    "replacing the mirror with an rca lens would enable higher spatial resolution . additionally , moving the rca lens would move its foci in response to the changes in toroidal field strength .",
    "the utility of a lens with a specifiable dependence of focal point on frequency may extend beyond tokamak ece detection .",
    "for example , the lens could be useful for the detection or irradiation of a moving target for which the particular frequency is unimportant .",
    "in such cases , the location of the focus may be adjusted rapidly simply by tuning the frequency of the receiver or source .",
    "techniques to control chromatic aberrations are not new .",
    "the oldest example is the achromatic doublet , a combination of a convergent and divergent lens of different materials and therefore different amounts of dispersion .",
    "while the focal length of each lens is a monotonic function of frequency @xmath2 , the focal length of a doublet is approximately quadratic in @xmath2 ; it matches a desired focal length @xmath3 exactly at two frequencies and approximately in a range around them .",
    "the concept is readily generalized to ",
    "apochromatic \" triplets or  superachromatic \" quadruplets of lenses , where @xmath3 takes a certain value at three or four frequencies .",
    "that value is typically the same , for the sake of minimizing chromatic aberration @xcite .",
    "this technique can , in theory , be applied to produce the reverse chromatic aberration desired for our ece optics .",
    "it would have significant disadvantages , however .",
    "in particular , ( 1 ) its degrees of freedom are limited to two per lens ( the focal length @xmath3 for a certain @xmath2 and the material , which indirectly fixes the dependence at other frequencies , @xmath4 ) and ( 2 ) there is a practical limit to the maximum number of lenses that can be arrayed or stacked together .    a metamaterial gradient - index lens approach , on the other hand , would avoid both of these limitations .",
    "metamaterial lenses , typically thinner than one wavelength , consist of hundreds of microscopic unit cells whose dimensions can be independently specified to achieve certain optical properties , such as negative refractive indices @xcite .",
    "one approach to developing such metamaterials is to design a miniaturized - element frequency selective surface ( mefss ) @xcite .",
    "the unit cells of such materials typically have sub - wavelength dimensions , allowing for the fabrication of surfaces whose filtering properties vary smoothly on length scales appropriate for lens applications .",
    "one application , which we have investigated previously , is to engineer an mefss - based lens exhibiting rca with a specific @xmath4 dependence @xcite .",
    "this paper describes in detail our methods to tailor the focusing characteristics of an mefss - based lens to meet the requirements for ece detection at diii - d .",
    "although single lenses made of natural materials are generally constrained to impart greater dispersion to waves with higher @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ , exhibit traditional chromatic aberration ) , metamaterials , in general , do not face this constraint @xcite .",
    "in particular , rca has recently been observed experimentally in certain mefss - based lenses designed for microwave frequencies @xcite .",
    "the surfaces in these lenses consist of alternating layers of square metal patches ( capacitive layers ) and wire grids ( inductive layers ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uc_schematic]b ) . altering the dimensions of the unit cells will affect the phase - advance of electromagnetic radiation transmitted through them ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on wave propagation through these materials ) .",
    "an mefss whose unit cell parameters ( and , by consequence , spatial phase - advance ) vary properly as a function of distance from the transverse axis will exhibit lens - like behavior .",
    "and @xmath5 associated with each unit cell are defined in the insets .",
    "( c ) model of an mefss as an ac transmission line , illustrating how the lens behaves as a spatial phase shifter . for a more detailed discussion ,",

    "[ fig : uc_schematic]a ) , with each zone associated with a certain phase - advance @xcite . outer zones ( i.e. those with larger annular radii ) impart greater phase - advances than those near the axis , such that an incident collimated beam of light that passes through a zoned mefss will undergo a transformation in its radial phase profile and taper to a focal point a certain distance beyond the lens . owing to the high number of degrees of freedom in the design of each unit cell , it is possible to identify a geometrical configuration having specified focal lengths for certain frequencies  including a configuration with rca , as we have previously shown numerically in the 8 - 12 ghz band @xcite .",
    "the appropriate unit cell parameters for each zone were chosen based on the results of simulations of radiation passing through single unit cells .    in the present paper , we have expanded upon the methods of ref .",

    "the lens has an aperture diameter of 0.30 m , equal to the diameter of the viewing port onto which it might be installed .",
    "the increase in aperture from ref .",
    "@xcite will necessitate a greater range of phase - advances from the unit cells .",
    "one way of accommodating this increased range is to increase the lens order , defined as the number of capacitive layers ( equivalently , the number of inductive layers plus one ) . from the point of view of the unit cell , adding extra layers amounts to stacking on extra spatial phase shifters . in this way",
    ", discrepancies in phase - advance between single layers can be magnified , allowing for greater variations in phase - advance overall between lens zones .",
    "practical considerations put limits on lens order , however : each added layer introduces new absorptive losses and increases fabrication costs . for this paper",
    "we have chosen to work with a 10th - order lens to strike a balance between these opposing considerations .    for improved accuracy in our determination of the desired spatial phase - advances for the lens unit cells , we have used gaussian optics rather than geometric optics , which is more appropriate for the frequency and length scales of our experiments .",

    "we will here define the focal length @xmath3 at frequency @xmath2 of a lens as the distance of the beam waist of an outgoing wave of frequency @xmath2 from the lens assuming the incoming wave had a uniform phase profile ( infinite @xmath15 ) at its point of incidence with the lens .",
    "( this requires the assumption that the outgoing wave is a gaussian mode with a well - defined beam waist ; in practice , however , the output will be a superposition of modes . )",
    "note that this is slightly different from geometric optics , which defines the focal length as the convergence point for parallel incident rays after refraction @xcite . to achieve this output ,",
    "the lens must convert the phase profile of the incoming wave ( assumed to be uniformly zero ) to the profile @xmath16 .    in our work , we begin with a set of focal lengths @xmath3 ( table [ table : benchmark_frequencies ] ) that the lens must have for a corresponding set of frequencies @xmath2 .",
    "this determines the phase profile @xmath16 that the lens must impart to the outgoing wave ; equivalently , it determines the radius of curvature @xmath17 associated with the phase profile .",
    "thus , in theory , the lens needs to impart a phase - advance @xmath18 to the incoming wave ( assumed to be a plane wave with @xmath19 at incidence ) at radial distance @xmath8 by a phase equal to @xmath16 .",
