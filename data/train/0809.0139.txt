    "ising model on triangular lattice , as an archetypical example of a frustrated system , was initially studied by wannier @xcite and newll @xcite .",
    "the triangular ising model has attracted much attention and because of its remarkable properties it has a long history of investigation .",
    "no exact solution is available in two dimensions in an arbitrary magnetic field .",
    "hence , simulations of the ising model are essential .",
    "monte carlo simulation methods have been widely using techniques to update the spins of the system and to study the ising model on triangular lattice to obtain numerical solutions .",
    "a number of monte carlo methods based on metropolis algorithms @xcite have been applied to the model in the past with somewhat mixed results .",
    "a classical monte carlo using metropolis algorithm runs into difficulties on large lattice sizes due to critical slowing down and rapid increase in correlation time . because of these reasons it is difficult to obtain meaningful results on larger lattice sizes . a cluster technique , which uses multi - cluster algorithm , was pioneered by swendsen and wang @xcite .",
    "their method demonstrated its validity and efficiency for the potts model successfully .",
    "similar ideas have been pursued by wolff @xcite who proposed single - cluster algorithm , a nonlocal updating technique based on multiple - cluster algorithm but more efficient and easily applicable to achieve the meaningful results .",
    "both of these cluster algorithms are very effective in reducing critical slowing down .",
    "but for the same system , one sweep of single - cluster or multiple - clusters take much more time than that of metropolis algorithm , hence less effective for large lattice sizes .",
    "very little has been done since then using these approaches on this model . since large systems have the advantage of reducing finite - size effects , for this reason , we are forced to look yet again for an alternative approach .    in this study , we attempt to use a mixture of extend a single - cluster ( multiple - cluster ) and metropolis algorithms to the ising model in two - dimensions on triangular lattice . applications of combined algorithm techniques have been extremely successful in lattice qcd @xcite and have given rise to great optimism about the possibility of obtaining results relevant to continuum physics from monte carlo simulations of lattice version of the corresponding theory . as mentioned above ,",
    "our aim is to use standard monte carlo techniques based on combined effect of single - cluster ( multiple - cluster ) and metropolis algorithm to update the spins of the system and see whether useful results can be obtained .",
    "the values of the critical exponents are well established for this model in 2-dimensions and in order for our method to be considered successful , it must reproduce these well - established values .",
    "for this purpose , the critical exponents are computed by using the combined algorithm .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the ising model in 2-dimensions in its lattice formulation . here",
    "we describe the details of simulations and the methods used to extract the observables .",
    "we present and discuss our results in sec .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is positive and denotes the strength of the ferromagnetic interaction , @xmath10 is the ising spin variable , and @xmath11 restricts the summation to distinct pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqn1 ] shows that the overall energy is lowered when neighbouring spins are aligned .",
    "this effect is mostly due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "no such restriction applies if the spins are anti - parallel .",

    "we define a compound sweep as one single - cluster updating sweep following with five metropolis updating sweeps . in our simulations , five compound sweeps were performed between measurements .",
    "we observed that metropolis - single - cluster ( multiple - cluster ) and compound sweep updating techniques proved equally good for large ensembles .",
    "however , in case of the compound sweep technique the computational cost turned out to be far less .",
    "for this reason we adapted this technique in our simulations .",
    "we generated @xmath15 ensembles at transition point for each lattice size to performed the finite - size analysis .",
    "high statistics could help us to obtain a more accurate result .",
    "since the ensembles were generated by monte carlo method , they were not completely uncorrelated .",
    "the jackknife procedure was employed because it took the autocorrelation between the ensembles into account and provided an improved estimate of the mean values and errors .",
    "from the fluctuation dissipation theorem , the heat capacity ( @xmath16 ) is the derivative of the energy with respect to temperature and has the form @xmath17 for improved comparability among different system sizes , it is better to compute the heat capacity per spin which is displayed in in fig .",
    "[ fig - capacity ] .",

    "we notice a progressive steepening of the peak as the lattice size increases , which illustrates a more apparent phase transition .",
    "note that due to finite size effects , the peak is flattened and moved to the right .",
    "our interest is to look for such a transition point and investigate the critical phenomena associated with the transition using finite - size scaling method @xcite    . ]",
    "the fourth - order magnetic cumulant @xmath19 , which is used to estimate the transition temperature , is defined by the following expression @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thermodynamic average value of the @xmath22th power of the magnetic order parameter per spin for the lattice of size @xmath23 with temperature @xmath24 .",

    "]      a better way to identify the order of the transition is the internal - energy cumulant @xcite defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thermodynamic average value of @xmath22th power of internal energy for the lattice of size",

    "@xmath37 is a useful quantity since its behavior at a continue phase transition is quite different from that at a first order transition .",
    "this variable has a minimum ( near the critical point ) , and in the limit @xmath38 achieves the value @xmath39 for a continuous transition , whereas @xmath40 is expected in the case of a first - order transition .",
    "plots of @xmath37 versus temperature for several lattice sizes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - order - cum - eng ] .",
    "the graphs indicate that the transition is not first - order since the energy culumant @xmath37 does not peak near the critical temperature .",
    "this has also been observed in various other studies @xcite",
    "[ fig - order - cum - mag ] shows the order parameter cumulant @xmath25 as a function of temperature for serval lattice sizes .",
    "in contrast with obtaining a negative minimum value in first order transition , @xmath25 drops from @xmath41 for @xmath42 to 0 for @xmath43 .",
    "this is in agreement with the continuous transition @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic susceptibility @xmath44 scales as @xmath45 for a discontinuous transition and as @xmath46 for a continuous one @xcite , we can also determine the transition order by @xmath44 s scaling behaviors . as discussed below , we find that @xmath44 scales as @xmath47 for @xmath42 and as @xmath48 for @xmath43 , but not as @xmath49 .",
