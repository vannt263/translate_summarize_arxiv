    "inflation @xcite is known to be the best solution to the fine tuning problems associated with the initial conditions of the universe in the standard big bang cosmology : it resolves so - called the `` homogeneity problem '' and `` flatness problem . ''",
    "moreover , quantum fluctuation of the inflaton fields generated during inflation can eventually provide seeds of large scale structure ( lss ) observed in our universe  @xcite .",
    "thus , it has been tested by observing the fluctuations in the lss , the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and so on through the satellite experiments such as cobe @xcite and wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite so far , and also will be more precisely checked by planck @xcite in the near future .",
    "the recent wmap seven data @xcite shows that the initial density perturbation is almost scale invariant and gaussian with @xmath4 and @xmath5 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the single field chaotic inflation is well consistent with the current observation , implying very small non - gaussianity suppressed by the slow - roll parameters  @xcite .",
    "if sizable non - gaussianity will be detected in planck satellite experiment in the near future , however , it will play the role of the criterion to select a realistic inflationary model .",
    "inflationary scenario is based on scalar field theory .",
    "although inflationary scenario seems to be inevitable in cosmology , it is very non - trivial to realize in quantum field theory . in order to keep the small inflaton mass against quantum corrections , introduction of supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is helpful as in particle physics . unless an inflationary model is not very elaborately constructed",
    ", however , introduction of susy is not enough : the positive vacuum energy in supergravity ( sugra ) induces the hubble scale inflaton mass , yielding @xmath6 during inflation , which destroys the slow - roll condition .",
    "it is called the `` eta - problem . ''",
    "`` hybrid inflation '' @xcite is basically an two field model with one as inflaton and the other , called waterfall field , to terminate the inflation when it becomes tachyonic .",
    "the advantage of it is that the inflaton s field value is small compared to the planck scale , and thus it is legitimate to use the low energy effective theory . in the susy version of hybrid inflation @xcite",
    ", the potential can be made flat enough , avoiding the eta - problem : fortunately the hubble induced mass term is accidentally cancelled out with the minimal k@xmath3hler potential and the polonyi type superpotential during inflation .",
    "the specific form of the superpotential can be guaranteed by the introduced u(1)@xmath2 symmetry .    by the logarithmic quantum correction to the scalar potential",
    ", the inflaton can be drawn to the true minimum , leading to reheating of the universe by the waterfall fields .",
    "moreover , thanks to such a logarithmic correction , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the waterfall fields can be determined with the cmb anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the vevs turn out to be tantalizingly close to the scale of the grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "accordingly , the waterfall fields can be regarded as gut breaking higgs in this class of models @xcite .",
    "this inflationary model predicts a red - tilted power spectrum @xcite around @xmath7 for @xmath8 e - folds .",
    "it is too large compared to the present bound on the spectral index .    in the `` natural inflation '' model @xcite , the inflaton field",
    "is regarded as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "hence , a u(1 ) peccei - quinn symmetry , u(1)@xmath9 , should be assumed to be there , and the inflaton s small mass can be protected against quantum corrections .",
    "its scalar potential , which is given by a sinusoidal functional of the inflaton , can be induced by instanton effects , which break u(1)@xmath9 .",
    "since intanton effects still respect a shift symmetry , the axion does not appear in the k@xmath3hler potential in the susy version of the natural inflation model @xcite .",
    "as a result , the unwanted hubble scale inflaton mass term is not induced in the sugra potential .    however , for the slow - roll parameter `` @xmath10 '' to be small enough in this model , the peccei - quinn breaking scale or the axion decay constant @xmath11 must be larger than the planck scale , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reduced planck mass ( @xmath14 gev ) .",
    "it implies that u(1)@xmath9 should be valid above the planck scale . however , such u(1)@xmath9 is not natural , because quantum gravity effects are known to break all global symmetries including u(1)@xmath9 . from sub - planckian peccei - quinn scale",
    "though with multiple axion fields  @xcite . ]    in this letter , we attempt to improve such shortcomings in the two inflation models , susy hybrid and natural inflation models , by combining them .",
    "that is to say , we will examine the possibility to achieve the spectral index of 0.96 and @xmath15 in the combined model .",
    "we will call it `` natural hybrid model '' for inflation .",
    "accordingly , we have two inflaton fields in this model in addition to the waterfall fields",
    ".    one of the important properties of two or multiple fields inflation models is the existence of the non - adiabatic perturbations during inflation and they can change the evolution of the curvature perturbation after horizon exit @xcite .",
    "the residual isocurvature perturbation may cause an observably large non - gaussianity @xcite , and becomes adiabatic .",
    "after the isocurvature modes are exhausted , the curvature perturbation is preserved during the radiation era and finally leaves the fossils in the cmb anisotropy observations .",
    "even though it was in the slow - roll phase , the non - adiabatic mode can redistribute the shape of the perturbation during inflation and finally leads to the non - gaussian feature at the end of inflation .",
    "the general condition for the large non - gaussianity was analytically derived in @xcite with some examples and studied in detail for the multi - field hybrid inflation model in @xcite .",
    "there are other multiple field models which generate large non - gaussianity such as the curvaton scenario , modulated ( p)reheating , and an inhomogeneous end of inflation .",
    "interestingly enough , it can be shown that these models have common features in the mechanism generating large non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "the on - going projects to improve the observational sensitivity with planck satellite @xcite and using lss data are expected to greatly constrain the non - gaussianity parameters or discover the non - gaussian feature in the primordial density perturbation in the near future .",
    "they could discriminate a right one among various mechanisms of density perturbation generation .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will construct an inflationary model and check the sugra corrections of the model . in section iii",
    ", we will discuss the various features , particularly the spectral index and large non - gaussianity predicted in this model .",
    "we will conclude in section iv .",
    "finally , section v is devoted to appendix , in which we presents various expressions related to the spectral index and the non - linear parameter , based on @xmath16 formalism .",
    "to preserve the small inflaton masses during inflation against the hubble scale sugra corrections , let us introduce the u(1)@xmath2 and a shift symmetry . under the u(1)@xmath2 symmetry , the superpotential @xmath17 and a superfield @xmath18",

    "( [ superpot ] ) .",
    "however , they do not give rise to qualitatively different patterns of inflation , compared to a simple case only with @xmath32 .",
    "so we will neglect them for simplicity .",
    "the `` @xmath29 term '' ( @xmath33 ) does not affect the inflationary scenario , since @xmath34 during inflation , as will be discussed later .",
    "on the other hand , it can be important when @xmath35 .",
    "we assume a hierarchy among the dimensionful parameters , @xmath36 .",
    "it turns out to be necessary for slow - roll of the inflatons and large non - gaussianity . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that they all are real parameters .",
    "we note that the u(1)@xmath2 forbids @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . , which destroy slow - roll inflation , and restricts the superpotential to the linear form of @xmath18 .",
    "this superpotential keeps the small inflaton mass against the large sugra correction of the hubble scale during inflation , as will be seen later .",
    "the scalar component of @xmath21 is composed of two real scalar fields , @xmath39 . because of the shift symmetry , the k@xmath40helr potential , which is a functional of @xmath41 , does not contain @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , the f - term scalar potential in sugra is expected not to induce the hubble scale mass term for @xmath42 during inflation @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ superpot ] ) , we can obtain the f - term scalar potential : @xmath43 the susy minimum is located at @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "( [ v_f ] ) , then , the vev of @xmath49 vanishes .",
    "since we have only the two constraints in the field space @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the vevs of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not fixed yet , and so there potentially remains a modulus .",
    "however , by including the soft susy breaking mass terms for them , @xmath55 , their vevs can be determined , @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 indicate the soft mass parameters for the real components of @xmath53 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",

    "thus , the vevs of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are @xmath67 we will focus on the case @xmath68 gev , because this case turns out to yield large non - gaussianity .    to obtain a sufficient inflation",
    ", we suppose @xmath69 initially .",
    "since @xmath70 plays the role of the mass squareds for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the initial condition @xmath69 compels the vevs of @xmath23 and @xmath24 to vanish during inflation . as a result , @xmath18 and @xmath21 can be light enough and the scalar potential becomes dominated by the positive vacuum energy density @xmath71 , only if the mass of @xmath18 in eq .",
