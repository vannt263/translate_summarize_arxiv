    "supernovae ( sne ) are exceptionally brilliant stellar explosions in the universe . over the last decade ,",
    "dozens of superluminous sne ( slsne ) whose peak magnitudes are @xmath0 mag @xcite have attracted intense interest from both observational and theoretical astronomers .",
    "slsne are the rarest class of supernovae discovered so far and have been classified into types i ( hydrogen - poor ) and ii ( hydrogen - rich ) . comparing the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "the ratio of the explosion rates of slsne to core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) is @xmath5 .",
    "discriminating among the energy - sources powering the slsne is rather tricky .",
    "however , these energy sources should leave their imprints on the light curves ( lcs ) and the spectra of these slsne .",
    "only very few slsne ( e.g. , sn 2007bi ) can be regarded as the `` pair instability sne ( pisne ) '' @xcite and explained by the @xmath1ni - powered model @xciteni - powered model in explaining sn 2007bi and other similar events . ] , while the majority of slsne can not be solely powered by @xmath1ni @xcite but can be explained by the ejecta - circumstellar medium ( csm ) interaction model @xcite or magnetar - powered ( ultra - highly magnetized pulsar ) model @xcite .",
    "because of the absence of emission lines indicative of the ejecta - csm interaction , the magnetar model is preferred in explaining almost all slsne - i ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "meanwhile , the ejecta - csm interaction model works well in explaining slsne - ii , especially superluminous sne iin @xcite .    in principle",
    ", @xmath1ni should be taken into account in light - curve modeling for all slsne .",
    "from the photometric aspect , however , slsne s @xmath1ni yields are usually rather small ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the luminosities provided by @xmath1ni are outshone by magnetars or ejecta - csm interaction , except for some pisn candidates that might be mainly powered by @xmath1ni . besides , @xmath1ni yields are difficult to be determined precisely owing to the lack of late - time spectra for most sne .",
    "hence , excluding a few pisn candidates , previous modelings for most lcs of slsne - i omitted the contributions of @xmath1ni .",
    "there are some more complicated cases : for some slsne - ii , e.g. sn  2006gy , adding several @xmath6 of @xmath1ni can make the fitting more reliable , the  @xmath1ni+interaction \" model has been employed @xcite . no slsn has involved with all three energy sources so far ; @xcite suggested that some luminous sne ic with peak magnitudes @xmath7 mag must be explained by a unified scenario containing the contributions from @xmath1ni and a magnetar (  @xmath1ni+interaction \" model ) since they can not be powered solely by @xmath1ni ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the contribution from @xmath1ni can not be neglected ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "recently , an slsn - i at redshift @xmath8 , iptf13ehe , might change the conclusions above .",
    "@xcite analyzed the light curve and spectra of iptf13ehe and found that the peak bolometric luminosity of iptf13ehe is @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "if this slsn was powered by @xmath1ni , more than @xmath11 of @xmath1ni must be synthesized to power the peak bolometric emission @xcite . however , the late - time spectral analysis indicated that the mass of @xmath1ni synthesized is @xmath12 2.5 @xmath6 .",
    "this amount of @xmath1ni , although it can not be ignored , is inadequate to power the peak bolometric luminosity .",
    "therefore , @xcite argued that the early lc must be powered by multiple power sources .",
    "furthermore , the presence of h@xmath3 emission lines in the late - time spectrum and the rebrightening in the late - time lc show an unambiguous signature for interactions between the sn ejecta and a hydrogen - rich csm .",
    "hence , any model with single power source or double power sources is challenged in explaining the lc of iptf13ehe .",
    "a triple - power - source model should be seriously considered .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a triple - energy - source model for iptf13ehe and try to understand its explosion mechanism and lc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : early ] and [ sec : late - time ] , we fit the early - time and late - time lc using double and triple energy - source models , respectively . in sections",
    "[ sec : dis ] and [ sec : con ] , we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "we start by studying the early lc and determining the power sources of iptf13ehe . as pointed out by @xcite , @xmath13 of @xmath1ni",
    "were synthesized while @xmath14 of @xmath1ni are required to account for the lc peak .",
    "therefore , there should be other energy sources to aid the high peak - luminosity of iptf13ehe .",
    "the early - time spectra shows no h emission lines , indicating that the ejecta - csm interaction can be neglected in the early - time luminosity evolution .",
    "hence , the energy source aiding the sn might be a magnetar spin - down input .",
    "the possibility that iptf13ehe is a ccsn and can be aided by a magnetar was also pointed out by @xcite , although they did nt provide further analysis .",
    "considering the contribution from @xmath1ni that can not be neglected , the most reasonable model should contain contributions from both @xmath1ni and a magnetar .",
    "@xcite have constructed such a unified model for sne ic and explained three luminous sne ic .",
    "we here employ this model to fit the lc of iptf13ehe .",
    "supposing that the ratio of the @xmath15-band flux to bolometric flux remains nearly constant around the peak and in the late - time , we scale the @xmath15-band luminosities to obtain the bolometric luminosities .",
    "the scaled bolometric luminosities are rough , but they can be regarded as an approximation of real values .",
    "these data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] . in this section ,",
    "we use some models to fit the early - time lc . the photospheric velocity and the optical opacity @xmath16",
    "are fixed to @xmath17 km s@xmath10 @xcite and @xmath18 @xmath19 g@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the first of the models employed here is the @xmath1ni - powered model .",
    "we find that when the ejecta mass @xmath20 , the gamma - ray opacity @xmath21 @xmath19 g@xmath10 , and the @xmath1ni mass @xmath22 , the theoretical lc can matches the observational data at early times ( @xmath23 days ) , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ( the dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the @xmath1ni mass obtained here is slightly larger than the value @xmath24 inferred by @xcite .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) to @xmath27 ( 35 @xmath6 ) is @xmath28 , significantly exceeding the upper limit of the values for ccsne ( the ratio of @xmath1ni mass to the ejecta mass is @xmath29 @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1ni - powered model can be excluded in explaining the data .",
    "ni , magnetar , and hybrid ( @xmath1ni + magnetar ) models .",
    "data are obtained from @xcite .",
    "the early - time and late - time bolometric luminosities scaled from @xmath15-band ones are shown as the orange filled circles and orange unfilled circles , respectively .",
    "the dash - dotted line is the lc powered by 19 @xmath6 of @xmath1ni ; the dashed line is the lc powered by a magnetar ; the solid line is the lc powered by @xmath1ni and a magnetar .",
    "the short dashed line is the lc powered by 2.5 @xmath6 of @xmath1ni with full trapping of gamma - rays .",
    "the other model parameter values are shown in the text.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]      in the magnetar - powered model , if the the initial rotational period of the magnetar @xmath30  ms , the surface magnetic field @xmath31 g , @xmath21 @xmath19 g@xmath10 , then the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] is plotted to obtain an equivalently good fitting .",
    "since the spectral analysis has inferred that the sn explosion produced @xmath32 of @xmath1ni , we take into account the contribution from @xmath1ni and use the hybrid model , in which the initial period of the magnetar @xmath33 is larger slightly , @xmath34  ms . from the fit , we can get other two important physical quantities relevant to the next section , i.e. , the rise time @xmath35 days and the kinetic energy of the sn explosion , @xmath36 erg .",
    "a caveat on the degeneracy of model parameters should be clarified here .",
    "the effective light - curve timescale @xmath37 @xcite determines the width and therefore the rise time of the lcs of sne , where @xmath38 is the speed of light and @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "if the value of @xmath40 is invariant , lcs around the peak are the same . although the photospheric velocity @xmath41 of iptf13ehe is fixed to 13,000 km s@xmath10 , the degeneracy of @xmath16 and @xmath27 is still difficult to be broken , because larger @xmath16 requires smaller @xmath27 for the same level of fittings .",

    "@xmath42  g@xmath10 , then the ejecta mass becomes larger , @xmath45 .",
    "the latter is consistent with the lower limit derived by @xcite .",
    "provided that iptf13ehe is a genuine core - collapse sn , the ejecta with mass of @xmath46 is preferred .",
    "we have demonstrated that the hybrid model containing the contributions from a magnetar and @xmath1ni can well fit the early - time lc of iptf13ehe , but the late - time rebrightening can not be explained by such a hybrid model .",
    "@xcite found that the late - time spectrum of the sn displayed h@xmath3 emission lines which are usually present in sne iin and inferred that a hydrogen shell ejected about 40 years before the sn explosion , locating at a distance of @xmath47 cm from the sn progenitor .",
    "when the sn ejecta run into the shell , an interaction was triggered and thus the @xmath15-band lc was rebrightened and the h@xmath3 emission was prompted .",
    "therefore , both the photometric and spectral features indicate that the interaction between the ejecta and csm must play an important role in powering the late - time lc @xcite",
    ".    however , the exact time of the emergence of the ejecta - csm interaction is uncertain due to the lack of the photometric data at @xmath48 days and the spectral data at @xmath49 days after the peak . nevertheless , the fact that there is no rebrightening in @xmath50 days after the peak provides a lower limit on the interaction onset time , while the rebrightening at @xmath51 days after the peak offers an upper limit .",
    "therefore , we suppose that the rebrightening started at @xmath52 days after the peak . adopting @xmath35 days , we conclude that the interaction should be triggered between @xmath53 days after the sn explosion .",

    "the values of other parameters are shown in the text.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    according to equations ( 14)-(16 ) and ( 20 ) of @xcite , we reproduce the late - time lc powered by the ejecta - csm interaction , seen in fig . [",
    "fig : fit2 ] .",
    "the fit parameters are the optical opacity of the h - shell @xmath56=0.34  @xmath42 g@xmath10 , the ejecta mass @xmath57 , the sn kinetic energy @xmath58 erg ( these two parameters are derived from the previous section ) , the slope of the inner density profile of the ejecta @xmath59 , the slope of the outer density profile of the ejecta @xmath60 , the power - law exponent for the csm density profile @xmath61 ( corresponding to a uniform - density shell ) , the density of the csm @xmath62 g @xmath63 , the mass of the csm @xmath64 , the onset time of interaction between the ejecta and the csm - shell @xmath65  days , the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy to radiation @xmath66 that is comparable to the typical value @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the density of the csm shell in our model is one order of magnitude larger than the value derived by @xcite . since the shock - ionized csm shell is probably optically thin to the thomson scattering @xcite , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the width of the shell , @xmath70 , so @xmath71 .",

    "[ fig : fit2 ] , the lc powered by the triple power - source model (  @xmath1ni+magnetar+ejecta - csm interaction \" model ) is well consistent with the data .",
    "if we ignore the contribution from @xmath1ni , the lc can be reproduced by the magnetar and ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "we caution that the bolometric lc is obtained by scaling the @xmath15-band lc and therefore is not accurate enough .",
    "the uncertainties in the bolometric luninosities prevent us from getting precise estimate of the model parameters .",
    "nevertheless , this does not change the facts that the early - time lc is mainly powered by a magnetar rather than @xmath1ni and that the late - time lc requires adding the ejacta - csm interaction .",
    "more accurate bolometric corrections can pose more stringent constraints on the parameters .",
    "the @xmath1ni production is usually ineffective after the explosion of a neutrino - driven ccsn .",
    "radioactive @xmath1ni in a neutrino - driven ccsn is mainly synthesized in two ways : a neutrino - driven wind and an explosive nuclear burning of silicon ( and other intermediate - mass elements ) heated to a temperature exceeding @xmath86 k. the neutrino - driven wind can produce @xmath87 of @xmath1ni and can be neglected ; the amount of @xmath1ni synthesized in shock - heating silicon shell is related with the shock energy and therefore the kinetic energy of a ccsn . when the kinetic energy is @xmath88 erg , the mass of @xmath1ni is @xmath89 .",
    "if the neutron star left behind the explosion is a millisecond magnetar , it can help the ejecta synthesize additional @xmath1ni up to @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the total amount of @xmath1ni from these processes is @xmath91 , significantly less than 2.5 @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it seems that the model containing the contributions from 2.5 @xmath6 of @xmath1ni and a magnetar is problematic .",
    "however , the possibility that the @xmath1ni mass of iptf13ehe has been overestimated can not be completely excluded .",
    "we can get some indirect clues from sn 2007bi : @xcite proposed that the amount of @xmath1ni synthesized by sn 2007bi is @xmath92 by matching the low - quality nebular - phase spectrum and concluded that sn 2007bi is a pisn , while @xcite showed that the pisn model must produce cool photospheres , red spectra and narrow - line profiles which conflict with observational properties of sn 2007bi , and concluded that sn 2007bi might be powered by a magnetar .",
    "this example indicates that the simple spectral analysis is not enough to determine the precise value of @xmath1ni yield and a more detailed analysis is needed . in this paper",
    ", we can regard @xmath13 as the upper limit of @xmath1ni yield of iptf13ehe .",
    "we note that sn ejecta - csm interaction might also be a promising scenario for explaining the early - time lc of iptf13ehe .",
    "if the progenitor experiences some eruptions and expels some discrete shells before its explosion , the ejecta can collide these shells at different epoches and the interactions between the ejecta and these shells can power the early - time lc .",
    "the intermittent spectral observations at early times might miss the spectral features . in this scenario ,",
    "the putative millisecond magnetar can be removed and the central remnant is therefore a black hole .",
    "however , how does the explosion synthesize @xmath2 of @xmath1ni in this scenario remains an open problem .",
    "we have analyzed and fitted the lc for iptf13ehe which is an slsn i with peak bolometric luminosity @xmath93 erg s@xmath10 . using the @xmath1ni - powered model",
    ", we found that @xmath94 of @xmath1ni are required , confirming the conclusion reached by @xcite .",
    "spectral analysis performed by @xcite shows that the slsn synthesized @xmath13 of @xmath1ni but this amount of @xmath1ni is inadequate to power the peak luminosity .",
    "we proposed that the most reasonable model accounting for the early - time lc is the magnetar - dominated model containing the contributions from a magnetar with @xmath95  ms and @xmath96 g and @xmath4 of @xmath1ni .",
    "the lcs reproduced by this model are in good agreement with early - time observations of iptf13ehe .",
    "the energy released by the magnetar is dominant in powering the optical lc of iptf13ehe .",
    "while proposing this hybrid model containing triple energy - sources , we also note that this model is not unique model of explaining iptf13ehe since the early lc might also be powered by the ejecta - csm interaction and @xmath1ni . since the ccsne usually produce @xmath91 of @xmath1ni , @xmath13 of @xmath1ni is problematic in both",
    " magnetar+@xmath1ni \" model and `` interaction+@xmath1ni '' .",
    "we regard @xmath13 as the upper limit and call for more detailed analysis .",
    "an important spectral feature owned by iptf13ehe is h@xmath3 emission lines in its late - time spectrum .",
    "these lines , together with the rebrightening of the late - time lc @xcite , indicate that the interaction between the sn ejecta and the csm has been triggered .",
    "the hybrid model involving @xmath1ni and magnetar can not account for the late - time rebrightening .",
    "we find that the ejecta - csm interaction model can explain the rebrightening and is the natural requirement accounting for the h@xmath3 emission lines .",
    "therefore , we use the model containing a magnetar , @xmath1ni , and ejecta - csm interaction to fit the whole lc .    finally , we discuss the explosion nature of iptf13ehe .",
    "the physical properties of the progenitors , the explosion mechanisms and energy - source mechanisms of slsne are still ambiguous and controversial ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for further analysis ) .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite , the massive hydrogen - rich shell must have been expelled by the ",
    "pulsational pair - instability ( ppi ) \" mechanism @xcite .",
    "the ejecta colliding with csm shell contains @xmath97 of @xmath1ni and @xmath98 erg of kinetic energy .",
    "this ejecta is not a shell following the hydrogen - rich shell , because @xcite pointed out that the shell expelled by ppi contains no @xmath1ni and its kinetic energy is up to several times @xmath99 erg .",
    "the kinetic energy of the ejecta of iptf13ehe is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of each ppi pulsed shell .",
    "therefore , we propose that iptf13ehe itself is a genuine ccsn rather than a ppisn candidate , while the hydrogen - rich massive shell could be caused by a ppi pulse @xmath12 20 years before the ccsn explosion ( @xmath100 @xmath12 17 years , the velocity of the csm shell @xmath101 was inferred by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that at least @xmath102 of slsne - i may own such interaction features for late - time spectra .",
    "we expect that future studies focusing on similar slsne should provide further insight into their explosion and energy - source mechanisms .",

    "<S> almost all superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) whose peak magnitudes are @xmath0 mag can be explained by the @xmath1ni - powered model , magnetar - powered ( highly magnetized pulsar ) model or ejecta - circumstellar medium ( csm ) interaction model . </S>",
    "<S> recently , iptf13ehe challenges these energy - source models , because the spectral analysis shows that @xmath2 of @xmath1ni have been synthesized but are inadequate to power the peak bolometric emission of iptf13ehe , while the rebrightening of the late - time light - curve ( lc ) and the h@xmath3 emission lines indicate that the ejecta - csm interaction must play a key role in powering the late - time lc . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a triple - energy - source model , in which a magnetar together with some amount ( @xmath4 ) of @xmath1ni may power the early lc of iptf13ehe while the late - time rebrightening can be quantitatively explained by an ejecta - csm interaction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we suggest that iptf13ehe is a genuine core - collapse supernova rather than a pulsational pair - instability supernova candidate </S>",
    "<S> . further studies on similar slsne in the future would eventually shed light on their explosion and energy - source mechanisms . </S>"
