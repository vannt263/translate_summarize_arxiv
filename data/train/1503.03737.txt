    "the ordering of anisotropic particles is a universal phenomenon appearing widely in nature , ranging from thermally driven molecules or colloids  @xcite to active particles such as bacteria colonies  @xcite , actin filaments  @xcite , animal groups  @xcite , and living liquid crystals  @xcite . in equilibrium lyotropic systems , such as hard rods interacting only through excluded volume interactions ,",

    "reminiscent to equilibrium systems , ordering transitions of vertically agitated granular rods were investigated in three - dimensional ( 3d ) and quasi - two - dimensional systems . in 3d , the aspect ratio of the rods was found to influence the ordered states of cylindrical rods  @xcite . in quasi - two - dimensional systems , a bulk isotropic - uniaxial nematic ( i - u ) transition",

    "( i )  the strong fluctuations in the nonequilibrium steady states of granular rods may lead to temporal disorder in a system that could in principle relax into an ordered state .",

    "to conclude , the ordering in agitated granular rod monolayers is found to be determined predominately by the aspect ratio of the rods and the area fraction , while the frequency and the strength of the agitation are not essential .",
    "it suggests that the detailed nature of energy injection into such a nonequilibrium system is not important , analogous to the role that temperature plays in equilibrium hard rod models . in comparison to previous experimental investigations on monolayer systems ,",

    "<S> the orientational order in vertically agitated granular rod monolayers is investigated experimentally and compared quantitatively with equilibrium monte carlo simulations and density functional theory . at sufficiently high number density , </S>",
    "<S> short rods form a tetratic state and long rods form a uniaxial nematic state </S>",
    "<S> . the length - to - width ratio at which the order changes from tetratic to uniaxial is around @xmath0 in both experiments and simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement illustrates the universal aspects of the ordering of rod - shaped particles across equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the assembly of granular rods into ordered states is found to be independent of the agitation frequency and strength , suggesting that the detailed nature of energy injection into such a nonequilibrium system does not play a crucial role . </S>"
