    "the heisenberg model of spin - spin interactions defined by@xmath1 is often considered as the starting point for understanding many complex magnetic structures in solids such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism at temperatures below the curie temperature .",
    "this hamiltonian arises from the direct coulomb interaction among electrons and the pauli exclusion principle , with @xmath2 the spin operator for the @xmath3th electron .",
    "the study of bosonic spin - spin interactions rise since the success in trapping a @xmath0na condensate in an optical potential @xcite , where spin degrees of freedom are liberated and it give rise to a rich variety phenomena such as spin domain formations @xcite , spin mixing dynamics @xcite , topological defects and so on .",
    "the properties of such a three - component spinor condensate were first studied with atomic spin coupling interaction takes the form @xmath4 by ho@xcite and ohmi @xcite , and had been implemented experimentally stenger , where two different spin - dependent phases exist : the so - called antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states for @xmath0na and @xmath5rb atomic condensates respectively .",
    "this spinor becs can be confined in optical lattices , which offers a unique opportunity to study magnetic properties of matter with tunable parameters.the quantum phase transition from the superfluid phase to the mott insulating state is well described by the spinless bose - hubbard hamiltonian@xcite and was demonstrated in experiments@xcite.with the atomic spin coupling interaction involved , the bose - hubbard hamiltonian is studied in the mott insulating regime , where phase coherence or superfluidity is lost , and atoms are localized with number fluctuations suppressed .",
    "such a insulating state represents a correlated many - body state of bosons and the calculations of the magnetic properties within spin - exchange interactions have been carried out sufficientlybefore1,before2,before3,before4,before5,before6,before7 .",
    "in addition to the spin - exchange interaction , there exists another important type of magnetic interaction , the magnetic dipole - dipole interactiondipole1,dipole2,dipole3,dipole4,dipole5,dipole6,dipole7,dipole8 , which plays an important role in domain formation in macroscopic samples .",
    "this model includes the long - range magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between different lattice sites , but neglects it within each site@xcite , assuming that it is much weaker than the s - wave interaction described .",
    "it is predicted that the ground state of @xmath0na bec ( @xmath6 ) is a spin singlet with properties ( @xmath7 ) @xcite contrast with those of mean field prediction .",
    "soon , ho and yip @xcite show that this spin singlet state is a fragmented condensate with anomalously large number fluctuations and thus has fragile stability .",
    "the remarkable nature of this fragmentation is that the single particle reduced density matrix gives three macroscopic eigenvalues ( above ) with large number fluctuations @xmath8 . in this paper , we consider specifically the case of spinor @xmath0na condensates and discuss the ground state properties and quantum number fluctuations in the zeeman components .",
