    "in the letter and in the response to our comment , the authors state that the scaling laws @xmath22 and hwhm @xmath23 do not account for the presence of outliers , and thus can not work for heavy - tailed @xmath3-stable disorder distributions . to begin with , we would like to note that the letter redefines the heavy tails property as `` decaying slower than lorentzian '' ( i.e.  concerning distributions with @xmath4 ) .",

    "]    the relation @xmath26 , which is the basis of the scaling law for @xmath24 , is a consequence of the self - similarity of @xmath3-stable distributions ( generalized central limit theorem , gclt ) and is closely related to the existence of their heavy tails .",
    "an @xmath3-stable distribution without heavy tails would have to follow central limit theorem ( the finite - variance version of gclt ) , leading to the relation @xmath27 .",
    "such a distribution is gaussian with its index of stability @xmath1 .",
    "for any lower value of @xmath3 , the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath16 carries the information about both the existence and asymptotic behaviour of the distribution s heavy tails ( disorder outliers ) and the behaviour of its core part ( moderate disorder , creating the effective potential wells ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath29 is the statistical strength of the average over the sites of all realisations  moderate or extreme  of disorder experienced by a delocalised state .",

    "@xcite must be the typical localisation length of all states , regardless of the mechanism by which they were localised .",

    "<S> however , they use a new energy range scaling to show that the theory breaks down in the high @xmath0 regime , where it was supposed to work according to the letter ( see fig .  3 and related discussion in the letter ) . </S>",
    "<S> in sec .  [ sec : outliers ] of this response we will show that this new breakdown is in fact caused by the high @xmath0 values and not by the low @xmath3 index . </S>",

    "<S> the authors agree with this remark .    </S>",
    "<S> what we have omitted in our comment , initially considering it an error of minor importance , is that the authors changed the mathematical definition of heavy - tailedness of @xmath3-stable distributions to `` decaying slower than lorentzian '' ( i.e.  concerning distributions with @xmath4 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we will prove in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : universal ] that the universal scaling laws take into account the outliers and the segmentation mechanism . </S>",

    "<S> thus , no amendments , like the segmentation law given by  eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) in the letter , are required . additionally , in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ subsec : nseg ] , we comment that the segmentation law has problems of its own and does not work in the @xmath0 regime to which it was applied in the authors response .    to summarise , our comment invokes the basic and very important mathematical property of @xmath3-stable distributions , which will be outlined in sec .  </S>",
