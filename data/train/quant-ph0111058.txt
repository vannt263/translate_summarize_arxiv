    "the interaction of lg modes with atoms has been studied extensively in the classical limit of the atom as a point particle @xcite .",

    "when @xmath51 , we can treat the interaction hamiltonian to lowest order in the center - of - mass position operators for the atom .    to couple neighboring circular states in the atom , we need a left - circularly polarized field . using the truncated form of the lg mode @xmath52 in eq .",

    "the interaction hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath70 to interpret the interaction in physical terms , recall that @xmath71 and @xmath72 raise the center - of - mass angular momentum , while @xmath73 and @xmath74 lower it .",

    "the spin and orbital components are separately conserved in the paraxial limit .",
    "choosing the orbital angular momentum of the lg mode to be positive or negative , @xmath56 , correlates the change in the internal and external angular momenta of the atom , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "we use eq .  ( [ hint2 ] ) as the starting point for a discussion of quantum entanglement between the internal and external angular momenta of the atom in the trap . consider @xmath79 , which gives the left - circularly polarized lg field a net angular momentum of zero . in this case , the change in internal and external angular momenta of the atom are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign . the time evolution operator in this case is given by @xmath80.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consider the action of this operator on the state @xmath81 . since the internal angular momentum of the atom can only be raised by @xmath35 , the external angular momentum has to be lowered by @xmath10 .",
    "however @xmath82 is the lowest energy state of the trap and can not be further reduced in energy .",
    "hence the state @xmath81 does not evolve in time according to this interaction .",
    "this restriction does not apply to the state @xmath83 , since the atom is in the higher angular momentum circular state to begin with , and we find rabi oscillations between states @xmath83 and @xmath84 . to summarize , we find that @xmath85      \\hat{u}_{\\mathrm{int}}(t ) { \\hspace{0.2 ex}}{\\mbox{$|m+1\\rangle$}}{\\mbox{$|\\chi_{0,0}\\rangle$ } } & = &      \\cos(\\eta \\omega t/2 ) { \\hspace{0.3 ex } } { \\mbox{$|m+1\\rangle$}}{\\mbox{$|\\chi_{0,0}\\rangle$ } } \\nonumber \\\\ * \\label{evolution2 }      & & { \\hspace{0.3 ex}}+{\\hspace{0.7 ex } }      i e^{i\\phi } \\sin(\\eta \\omega t/2 ) { \\hspace{0.3 ex } } { \\mbox{$|m\\rangle$}}{\\mbox{$|\\chi_{1,1}\\rangle$}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath86 .",
    "equations  ( [ evolution1 ] ) and ( [ evolution2 ] ) give the basic ingredients for quantum control of the selected internal and external states of the atom .",
    "when the trap is in the ground state and the atom is prepared in a coherent superposition of the circular states @xmath1 and @xmath61 , a @xmath87-pulse transfers this coherence to the center - of - mass state of the atom in the trap , @xmath88 \\mbox { } { \\mbox{$|\\chi_{0,0}\\rangle$ } } & \\nonumber \\\\ * \\label{pipulse }      & { \\hspace{10 ex } } \\mapsto      { \\mbox{$|m\\rangle$}}\\mbox { } [ c_m { \\mbox{$|\\chi_{0,0}\\rangle$ } } + c_{m+1}{\\mbox{$|\\chi_{1,1}\\rangle$ } } ] , & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have chosen @xmath89 .",
    "alternatively , if the atom is in the upper circular state @xmath61 and the trap is in the ground state , a @xmath90-pulse creates maximal entanglement between the internal and external states , @xmath91 { \\hspace{-0.2 ex}},\\ ] ] where @xmath89 again .",
    "we have to be in the adiabatic limit where the pulse length is long enough that the spectrum does not overlap neighboring trap states in energy .",
    "equation  ( [ pi/2pulse ] ) is the main result of this paper , that we can in principle generate states of a single atom that are entangled in internal and external angular momenta using a circularly polarized lg mode .",
    "this is a new form of entanglement that relies on the conservation of angular momentum rather than energy .",
    "the two observables that are entangled are @xmath11 and @xmath92 , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ angularmomentumext ] ) and ( [ angularmomentumint ] ) respectively .",
    "the experimental difficulty is in measuring the quantized center - of - mass state of the atom in the trap .",
    "a direct observation of the trap state may be engineered as follows .",
    "when the atoms are released from an excited trap state , they escape with a net linear momentum in the azimuthal direction , which may be detected by time - of - flight measurements using a suitably positioned detector array .",
    "an indirect observation of the entanglement present in eq .",
    "( [ pi/2pulse ] ) is possible using a weak probe pulse resonant with the circular states @xmath61 and @xmath93 . in this case , only the state @xmath94 is affected by the pulse , and the absorption of a photon would distinguish this state from @xmath83 .",
    "it is intriguing to consider the application of the ideas in this paper to quantum information processing .",
    "rydberg circular states are extremely long - lived , with radiative lifetimes of the order of @xmath95 milliseconds even for @xmath96 , increasing as @xmath97 for larger @xmath98 .",
    "the two circular states @xmath1 and @xmath61 may be thought of as a qubit , and the interaction with the lg mode provides a controlled coupling to the second qubit formed by the ground and first excited state of the trap . in this context ,",
    "( [ evolution1 ] ) and ( [ evolution2 ] ) allow arbitrary controlled unitary operations , where the internal state of the atom plays the role of the control qubit .",
    "one possibility to scale up this scenario is to consider two or more atoms individually trapped and manipulated in this manner .",
    "a coupling between two atoms may be achieved by entangled photons in lg modes , as demonstrated recently in the parametric downconversion experiment of ref .",
    "the trap states of each atom can play the role of an auxiliary or intermediary qubit that enables information processing in the internal states of the atom .",
    "decoherence issues involved with trapping and cooling the atom to the center - of - mass ground state benefit from the weak coupling of neutral atoms to the environment .",
    "lastly , we highlight the benefits of going beyond two internal states ( beyond qubits ) in the atom .",
    "we chose the circular states because they made a good two - level system .",
    "however , there are @xmath99 angular momentum states in the atom for each principal quantum number @xmath98 , all of which are degenerate in hydrogen .",
    "this allows for the possibility of simultaneous control of these states and entanglement with the trap states .",
    "angular momentum entanglement is particularly suited for large - scale information processing in the atom .",
