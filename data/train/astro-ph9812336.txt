    "following a suggestion by kosteleck,@xcite we posit the electron neutrino to be a tachyon with @xmath1 and consider the consequences for the cosmic ray ( cr ) spectrum .",
    "the hypothesis , while it is highly speculative , is consistent with other neutrino observations , and it predicts the existence of a cr neutron flux in a narrow range of energies centered on @xmath2 .",
    "tachyons , first postulated in 1962 , by bilaniuk , deshpande , and sudarshan,@xcite are taken seriously by few physicists , because of the paradoxes they create , and because nearly@xcite all experiments specifically@xcite searching for tachyons have turned up negative.@xcite whatever one s view of tachyons , their existence is clearly an experimental question .",
    "weakly interacting tachyons of low mass would have probably escaped detection , or else not be recognized as such . in fact , chodos , hauser and kosteleck suggested in 1985 that neutrinos are tachyons.@xcite    chodos et al.@xcite noted that one could test this hypothesis using a strange tachyon property , i.e. , that particle decays producing tachyons which are energetically forbidden in one reference frame are allowed in another .",
    "thus , consider the  decay \" : @xmath3 .",
    "for the decay to conserve energy in the proton rest frame , we need @xmath4 .",
    "now , tachyons , unlike other particles , have @xmath5 so they can change the sign of @xmath6 when boosted to a sufficient velocity .",
    "thus , the tachyon energy in the proton rest frame , @xmath7 has the opposite sign from its energy in the lab @xmath8 when @xmath9 exceeds @xmath10",
    ".    the threshold lab energy for protons to decay is found by making @xmath11 the least negative it can be in the cm frame , i.e. , @xmath12 , and taking @xmath13 therefore , at threshold @xmath14 , and hence @xmath15 , so that    @xmath16    for nuclei of mass number a , @xmath17 is the mass of the parent nucleus , and @xmath18 .",
    "the idea of  stable \" particles decaying is less paradoxical if one reinterprets the emitted @xmath19 with @xmath20 in the lab frame to be an absorbed @xmath21 with @xmath22 from a background sea in the proton rest frame ",
    "the so - called  reinterpretation principle.\"@xcite this antineutrino background sea defines an absolute reference frame , presumably coincident with that defined by the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) .    in order to test the prediction of chodos et al . as applied to the cr spectrum , we need to calculate the mean free path for protons and other stable cosmic ray nuclei to decay as a function of their energy .",
    "although we can easily deduce the threshold for such decays from kinematic arguments , finding the decay rates requires a knowledge of tachyon dynamics .",
    "one might assume that the phase space involving negative energy tachyons could be treated in a similar manner as for positive energy particles . under this assumption",
    "the decay rate for @xmath23 could be estimated by integrating that tiny region of phase space in the cm for which @xmath11 changes sign between the cm and lab frames , and also assuming that the usual weak interaction coupling constant applies to the process .",
    "however , the validity of such an approach is questionable . given the reinterpretation principle , the rates for the processes @xmath23 and @xmath24 must be identical for any given proton energy .",
    "but the reaction rate of the latter reaction depends on both known antineutrino cross sections as well as the unknown density of antineutrinos in the background sea @xmath25 , and hence we have no way to estimate reliably the @xmath23 decay rate .",
    "this being the case , we simply make an assumption that holds promise for explaining the knee of the cr spectrum : at all proton energies significantly above threshold that the rate for proton decay greatly exceeds that for conventional neutron decay .",
    "the idea that tachyonic neutrinos might explain the knee of the cr spectrum was first raised by kosteleck , though he regarded the existence of the knee by itself as insufficient evidence for the hypothesis in view of other explanations of the knee.@xcite moreover , kosteleck neither modelled the cr spectrum , as is done here , nor mentioned the signature neutron spike .",
    "the inputs to the model are assumptions for : ( 1 ) @xmath26 values , ( 2 ) the energy spectrum and composition of cr s at their source , and ( 3 ) the spatial distribution of sources .    for the spatial distribution , we take an admixture of  near \" and  far \" sources .",
    "near sources are assumed to create cr s having path distances to earth from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ly , and far sources are assumed to have path distances from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ly .",
    "for the source spectrum we use an @xmath30 power law that fits the spectrum up to @xmath31 essentially , we assume that the source spectrum is @xmath30 for all @xmath6 , and that changes in the observed spectrum are due to particles in a given energy bin being shifted to lower energies as a result of beta decay .",
    "since the composition of cr s above the knee is not well known , we try various compositions to fit the data .",
    "the monte carlo method was used to obtain figs . 1 - 3 .",
    "protons and nuclei were generated at various distances from earth , and the fate of all particles in a given energy bin was considered to be the same , as their progress toward earth was followed . for protons leaving sources above the threshold energy for decay , there is a chain of decays @xmath32 which stops when the nucleon either reaches earth or else has its energy reduced below threshold .",
    "as long as @xmath6 is above threshold , the nucleon spends most of its time en route from the source as a rectilinearly propagating neutron , because the mean free path for neutrons before they decay is much greater than that for protons except quite close to @xmath33 a similar decay chain occurs in the case of @xmath34 cr nuclei . after each decay",
    "the daughter nucleus has less energy in the lab frame than the parent .",
    "calculating the energy loss of the nucleon in a conventional beta decay such as @xmath35 is straightforward . in the cm frame",
    "= 3.25 in    the proton has very little energy following the decay , and hence in the lab frame the nucleon loses a constant fraction @xmath36 of its energy . for the energetically forbidden decay , such as @xmath37",
    "the situation is more complex . here for proton lab energies much above threshold the neutrino needs to have highly negative energies in cm so that its energy in the lab frame be positive , and hence the daughter nucleus energy can no longer be ignored in the cm frame .",
    "the calculation can be done as a sequence of two two - body decays : e.g. , @xmath38 followed by @xmath39 , where in the first decay we choose only those events having @xmath40 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the log of the all particle flux @xmath41  both data and calculation . a reasonably good fit to the spectrum is obtained for @xmath42 ( solid curve ) , assuming that 13 % of sources are  near , \" with elemental abundances : 70% a=1 , 10% a=4 , 10% a= 5 to 19 , 5% a = 20 to 40 , and 5% a = 41 to 90 .",
    "the solid curve convolutes the monte carlo results with an energy resolution @xmath43 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the goodness of fit worsens if the resolution is @xmath44 ( long dashes ) or zero ( short dashes ) . in these two latter cases ,",
    "the fits use @xmath45 and elemental abundances : 65% a=1 , 10% a=4 , 5% a= 5 to 19 , 5% a = 20 to 40 , and 15% a = 41 to 90 .",
    "no decent fits exist for @xmath46 .",
    "all three fits would also dramatically worsen if there were no near sources  since the curves would then drop sharply at @xmath47 thus , the flux beyond this energy appears in the model to come primarily from the 13 % of sources that arenear . \"",
    "a convenient way to represent changes in the composition of the cr s is to plot @xmath48 versus energy ",
    "2 . the model results are in rough agreement with the data in its essential features : a rise of @xmath49 from the knee of the spectrum to a maximum near @xmath50 to @xmath51 and a subsequent decline to a near zero value , i.e. , almost pure protons , at @xmath52 . given the difficulty in measuring the composition of cr s above the knee , such rough agreement is not unreasonable .    exactly what is needed in the model to reproduce the specific features seen in the data ?",
    "* the knee at @xmath53 * requires @xmath54 , so that threshold energy for cr protons to decay occurs at this energy , and the proton component drops precipitously  jagged curve in fig . 1 .    * the @xmath55 power law between @xmath56 and @xmath51 * ( near horizontal slope in fig .",
    "1 ) is reproduced only with the choice of composition noted previously , and a large enough energy resolution to smooth out the bumps from different element thresholds .    * the position of the dip at @xmath57 * also depends on the @xmath58 value .",
    "it occurs because at this energy the threshold for the heaviest elements to decay is reached , and the spectrum becomes depleted .",
    "* the rise for @xmath59 * , occurs because as @xmath6 increases , an increasing fraction of a=1 particles from the near sources can reach us , given their lengthened lifetime and mfp .",
    "this rise needs 13 % of sources to be  near , \" which is how the model  explains \" the apparent lack of gzk cutoff.@xcite    * composition vs energy ( fig .",
    "2 ) * the composition is heavy before the dip at @xmath60 because only the heaviest elements are left in the spectrum at this @xmath6 , since their thresholds have not yet been reached .",
    "however , at the highest energies the cr s are found to be very light , because by @xmath57 the thresholds for all @xmath34 nuclei have been reached , while this @xmath6 is far enough above @xmath61 for a = 1 that this component is coming back .    *",
    "the source spectrum * was chosen as @xmath30 to match the observed spectrum below the knee .",
    "equivalently , any other power law @xmath62 could have been used if the effect of energy loss processes not included here were simply to steepen the source power law by @xmath63 ( of course , the dominant ( a = 1 ) spectral component should show very little energy loss due to other processes if the nucleons are neutrons during most of their time en route . )",
    "while the model may be consistent with some features of the cr spectrum , that is a far cry from being evidence for tachyonic neutrinos .",
    "let us consider a few of the problems with the model .",
    "* conventional explanations exist * for some of the regularities we have noted , and plausible mechanisms exist to account for the production of the component of the spectrum believed to be galactic in origin . however , few conventional explanations predict numerical values for the position of the knee and ankle , and many of the models have both ad hoc elements and free parameters . moreover , explaining some of the spectral features represents a very severe test of all conventional models  particularly the _ abruptness _ of the change in slope at the knee and ankle.@xcite    * a source composition independent of energy is highly unrealistic . * but by making this assumption we are merely limiting the number of free parameters .",
    "* other models can account for the absence of a gzk cutoff . * various suggestions",
    "have been made to explain why cr s with energies above the conjectured gzk cutoff ( @xmath64 ) apparently fail to be significantly degraded in energy by interaction with the cbr.@xcite nevertheless , as long as no specific distant sources have been identified , it would seem that the least exotic hypothesis is that cr sources with @xmath65 simply are closer than a few dozen mpc ( as our model requires ) , _ even if no specific sources have so far been identified .",
    "_    * no mechanisms are known that have a single power law spanning over ten decades .",
    "* of course , there are no known sources in the conventional theory of cr s at the highest energies either , though topological defects have been suggested as one possibility.@xcite but they have not been proposed to account for the lower energy region , which are believed to originate from supernova shocks .",
    "one exotic possibility for sources has been proposed by kuzmin and tkachev : the decay of supermassive long - lived particles produced in the early universe.@xcite one advantage of this possibility from our point of view is that such sources could be a considerable fraction of cold dark matter , and hence could be prominent in the milky way galactic halo , and therefore relatively nearby .",
    "yet , they would also be relatively isotropic , as seems to be the case for the limited number of events so far seen at the highest energies .",
    "the seven tritium beta decay experiments used by the particle data group@xcite all report @xmath66 .",
    "two of these experiments report @xmath66 by over four standard deviations @xmath67 , but they are also @xmath68 apart .",
    "regrettably , the value we have used here @xmath69 is too small to be consistent with either of these experiments .",
    "moreover , the tritium results have been explained in terms of either experimental anomalies,@xcite final state interactions , or new physics@xcite  though some have attributed them to tachyonic neutrinos.@xcite if the electron neutrino really were a tachyon , could future tritium beta decay experiments test for values of @xmath70 ?",
    "the current systematic and statistical errors on @xmath71 are over an order of magnitude larger , so probably not without new types of instruments .",
    "if neutrinos really were tachyons , why should one put any more faith in the mass obtained from a fit to the cr spectrum than the much larger values found in tritium experiments ?",
    "one answer is that the only statistically significant negative values found in tritium experiments are inconsistent , and have been attributed to other causes .",
    "secondly , if any of the masses from tritium experiments represented real tachyons , then the knee of the cr spectrum would have to occur one or two decades lower in energy than is observed , because the threshold energy for proton decay varies inversely with @xmath72 alternatively , if @xmath73 found from the cr spectrum fit is correct that only means that the values reported in the tritium experiments arise from causes other than tachyons .",
    "are there other places one might look for confirmation of the tachyonic neutrino hypothesis ?",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments , being sensitive to @xmath74 can not reveal whether individual neutrino flavors have @xmath75 and mass limits from the 1987a or future supernovae would seem to lack the needed sensitivity",
    ". there is , however , one unambiguous test of the tachyonic neutrino hypothesis involving a cr neutron flux ",
    "the signature of the model is a spike of neutrons just above the threshold energy for proton beta decay at @xmath76 the uncertainty in the spike s position corresponds to the range : @xmath77 the pile up of neutrons just above @xmath61 is a consequence of the fractional energy loss of the nucleon becoming very small as @xmath61 is approached from above .",
    "given distances to cr sources , virtually all neutrons below @xmath61 decay to protons long before reaching earth . as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , the neutron spike might even be seen in plots of the integrated flux if the background were small enough .",
    "based on air shower measurements , it may be impossible to distinguish individual n s from p s in the region of the knee of the spectrum , but , there is one clear difference : unlike protons or nuclei , multiple neutrons should point back to specific sources .",
    "moreover , given the neutron lifetime , the mfp before decay at an energy of @xmath78 is only about 200 ly ",
    "much too close for many sources in any conventional model . as fig .",
    "1 shows , neutrons should also be seen as a large component of the flux at energies above @xmath79 however , if neutrons were seen at these energies , they could well be the result of sources closer than 0.2 mly , and they would , therefore , have little value in confirming the hypothesis of tachyonic neutrinos .",
