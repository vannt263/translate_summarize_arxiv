    "[ fig : ortho ] ]    a peculiarity of our notation , that we inherit from spin networks , is that each leg of the tensor also carries a representation index @xmath38 that is typically superimposed to the line . in order to avoid confusion , after fig .",
    "[ fig : w_g ] we will drop all the letters labeling the indexes of the tensors ( unless really needed ) , and keep only the letters related to the irrep @xmath38 .    a second result of the theory of group representations is that @xmath69 , that is the direct sum of all the @xmath55 is a unitary transformation as encoded in following relations , @xmath70    a graphical representation of the direct sum of @xmath55 leading to @xmath71 is presented in fig .

    "[ fig : w_g ] ]      in the context of many - body quantum systems , symmetries play a fundamental role in the classification of phases .",
    "recently , in the context of tn states , symmetries have been used to classify gapped phases of 1d systems @xcite . for this reason",
    "a strong effort has been devoted to incorporate the appropriate exact symmetries even when studying many - body systems with approximate variational ansatz . in the context of tn , a sufficient condition in order to have symmetric states is that the constituent tensors are symmetric @xcite . as an example a symmetric tensor with respect to the group @xmath3 with one in - leg and two out - legs obeys the following equation , @xmath75 with @xmath39 the matrix of the appropriate unitary representation of the group @xmath3 .",

    "equation can be satisfied by non - vanishing tensors only when the tensor product @xmath76 contains the trivial representation , that is the representation where all group elements are mapped to the identity .",
    "it is thus important to be able to explicitly construct the trivial representation contained in a given tensor product of different representations . for continuous groups",
    "this can be done by diagonalizing the corresponding casimir operators . their zero eigenvalues , if present , identify the trivial factors .",
    "the way this is done in practice is explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .    an alternative way , which works both for discrete and continuous groups , is to explicitly build the projector onto the trivial representation as a group sum ( or integral in the case of continuous groups ) .",
    "the projector is given by @xmath77 as can be found i.e. in ref @xcite .",
    "this is the method that we will mostly use .",
    "a third possibility entails disentangling the symmetry constraints following the ideas of refs .",

    "the physical processes , described by the maxwell equations , depend only on the electric and the magnetic fields while maxwell equations can be written in terms of a vector potential and in this form they show some redundancy . the vector potential can be modified by adding to it the gradient of an arbitrary scalar potential , without affecting the corresponding electric and magnetic field , so giving the same physical results .    at a quantum level",
    "the vector potential becomes a full quantum field , and the redundancy appears as a local symmetry in the action that drives its dynamics .",
    "the generalizations of these ideas to vector potentials describing non - abelian `` electric and magnetic '' fields , and their success in describing the hadron spectrum , gave rise to the modern gauge theories , and to our understanding of particle physics .",

    "the value of @xmath380 extracted from different series of @xmath83 do not agree as shown by the fact that curves made by different symbols are distinct .",
    "this effect could be related to the sub - leading corrections that become more important when we approach the transition .",
    "we also observe that for larger systems , the cross - over region shrinks and move towards the phase transition at @xmath395 .",

    "we see that , for small @xmath357 , @xmath380 coincides , independently of the size of the cylinder considered , with the expected exact value @xmath11 ( left inset ) .",

    "li and haldane in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested that phases could be easier to identify by considering the scaling of the full entanglement spectrum rather than focusing on a single number as the topological entropy .",
    "the entanglement spectrum is the collection of the logarithm of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath401 .    in particular , numerical studies of 1d systems",
    "have provided a precise characterization of the scaling of the lowest part of the entanglement spectrum , the one associated to the largest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xcite . in many cases , the lowest gap of the entanglement spectrum , called the schmidt gap ,",
    "vanishes when approaching a quantum phase transition following universal scaling laws .",
    "the authors thus have proposed to use the schmidt gap as an order parameter .",
    "this idea is further supported by the recent results that show that for conformal invariant critical points , several gaps in the entanglement spectrum close in a way that allows to identify the critical exponents of the underlying cft @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear how general these results are .",
    "for this reason we have decided to analyze the behavior of the lowest part of the entanglement spectrum of @xmath355 of half cylinders , when approaching the transition at @xmath402 .",
    "in particular we address the cross - over region between @xmath403 , where the analysis of the topological entropy is unreliable .",

    "the main panel shows the first 100 values of the entanglement spectrum @xmath401 as a function of @xmath357 in the cross - over region .",
    "surprisingly nothing strange seems to happen .",
    "the spectrum presents the plateaux structure characteristic of the rk wave functions .",
    "the structure of the first plateaux seems quite stable , and the only effect of increasing @xmath357 towards @xmath372 is to shift the relative height of the plateaux so to accommodate the appearance of new ones in the tails .",
    "in particular the first two eigenvalues are degenerate for all the interval considered .",
    "the schmidt gap is indeed constantly zero and does not detect the transition . even from the plot of the second schmidt gap , which increases monotonically with @xmath404 , we are unable to appreciate that we are approaching a phase transition as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : num_sp ] for several values of @xmath83 .",

    "here we try to list the works that have contributed to our understanding of various topics and to the final formulation of our proposal as we have outlined .",
    "there are several good references for group theory in a diagrammatic notation .",
    "in particular the book @xcite deals with continuous groups .",
    "continuous groups and the specific case of @xmath290 have been extensively studied in the literature of tns @xcite .",
    "the reader not familiar with the elementary concepts in the theory of group representations would benefit from studying the first few chapters of some of the standard text - books @xcite .",
    "a nice summary of relevant material can also be found in the appendices of @xcite .    a nice introduction to lgt in the lagrangian formulation can be found in @xcite and in any of the standard textbook on the subject , i.e. @xcite . the standard hamiltonian formulation was obtained by kogut and susskind , and by creutz @xcite .",
    "truncated lgt where discussed independently by many authors @xcite that have called them gauge magnet or quantum link models .",
    "horn originally introduced a model similar to the one described here in sect .",
    "[ sec : t_ks ] , which we generalize here to arbitrary continuous and discrete groups . later in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum link models where generalized to several continuous gauge groups with a different strategy from the one presented here . in the same work ,",
    "they where also given an interpretation in terms of rishons . in that language , the truncated lgt we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : t_ks ] when dealing with continuous groups , is a specific quantum link model with two rishons per link , while the one in sect .",
    "[ sec : gm ] is a quantum link model with one rishon per link .",
    "still the results we present here can be applied also to discrete groups , and thus provide a further generalization of quantum link models .",
    "also they allow to easily distinguish between those quantum link models that can be obtained as a consistent truncation of the ks lgt and those that can not .",
    "the study of lattice gauge theories with matrix product states , the simplest 1d tn structure , has by now a quite long tradition , @xcite 2d lgt with tns on the other hand have been less studied .",
    "lgt with discrete groups have been addressed with entanglement renormalization in @xcite , some aspects of them have been studied in @xcite with categorical tns , a construction that has strong connections to the present proposal . there however the emphasis is on abelian discrete groups and the lgt are addressed at the exactly solvable point obtained at @xmath408 while here we discuss a construction that allows to tackle generic groups both abelian and non - abelian , discrete and continuous at any point in the phase diagram .",
    "lgt have also recently been addressed by using tensor renormalization schemes @xcite .",
    "there have been several proposal on how to obtain the gauge invariant hilbert space .",
    "the original proposal by ks was to act on a reference state with all possible gauge invariant operators .",
    "however , there the states generated are not necessarily orthogonal and thus special care need to be taken .",
    "t. osborne has pointed out refs .",
    "@xcite to us that is related ( implicitly ) to our work , and we also found the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite very illuminating .",
    "t. osborne himself is working along similar ideas @xcite and in particular he has independently worked out operators similar to the ones we have presented in eq . and .    in the context of characterizing a family of states ( such as the rk states we have discussed ) ,",
    "t. osborne has pointed out refs .",
    "@xcite . in condensed matter ,",
    "in particular , the recent results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite have been obtained by applying similar ideas to the characterization of singlet states .",
    "at last we have also used the available literature about tn and topological order in order , whenever possible to make connections between our ideas and the one presented in that context .",
    "in particular we have found particularly useful the ref .",
    "@xcite .    to our knowledge",
    "the only previous mention to vertex operators in the context of lgt is the one of ref .",
    "@xcite however there the analysis is limited to @xmath0 and @xmath12 lgt while here we give a prescription for arbitrary groups .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that there is an alternative connection between lgt and tn through a map of the low - energy physics of qcd in the chiral limit to the physics of specific spin chains as pursued in @xcite .",
    "finally , several groups have recently addressed the experimental implementation of truncated lgt @xcite .    with respect to the absence of the closure of the schmidt gap across a phase transition ,",
    "a similar observation was made in ref .",
    "@xcite and while we were preparing the final version of our manuscript in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have provided a plausible argument to understand that this is a quite general phenomenon for phase transitions between different rk states .",
    "in this paper we have defined a tn framework for studying lgt .",
    "it allows to use tns as both a lgt model - building tool ( and as such we have used to construct the minimal consistent - truncation scheme for the ks lgt ) and as a practical tool to numerically explore lgt , their phase diagrams , and their emerging properties .",
    "the ansatz we have proposed follows the same spirit as the one proposed in ref .",
    "the tn indeed has a symmetric part that allows to exactly encode the constraints imposed by the gauge - symmetry conditions , and a variational part , which can be optimized numerically in order to characterize interesting physical states such as the low - energy states of gauge invariant hamiltonians .",
    "the new framework is also very powerful from the theoretical point of view . in this paper",
    "we have been indeed able to derive through it a consistent truncation of local hilbert space of the ks lgt with continuous group to finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "we have obtained also an explicit alternative construction of gauge magnets and of their @xmath26-operators for arbitrary gauge groups [ eq . ]",
    "that is also applicable to discrete groups , and the construction of gauge invariant vertex operators for arbitrary gauge groups [ eq . ] .",
    "we have also been able to show that , differently from the abelian case , the non - abelian gauge magnets can not be obtained as a consistent local truncation of the ks lgt . for this reason they stand as an alternative microscopic formulation of lgt .",
    "this result does not exclude the possibility that both gauge magnets and the ks lgt can encode the same emergent physics .",
    "it excludes however that they are locally ( where by locally we mean at the level of a single link ) unitarily equivalent .",
    "furthermore , the distinct form of their projectors onto @xmath4 in terms of tn ( given explicitly in app .",
    "[ app : tensors_su2 ] and [ app : tensors_su2gm ] ) also points to the fact that their rk states are probably different ( as we will analyze in a subsequent paper ) .",
    "this is not particularly surprising since the relation between the low - energy physics of quantum link models and of standard lgt was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and required the use of dimensional reduction arguments ( so that @xmath409 dimensional quantum link models are expected in some limit to be equivalent to @xmath1 dimensional standard lgt ) .",
    "the tools that we have developed here can be used to analyze the entanglement content of interesting lgt states .",
    "the entanglement , studied in a basis of states belonging to the original hilbert space , tensor product of the constituents , does not have a direct physical meaning ( since the only measurable operators in a real gt are gauge invariant operators , c.f .",
    "the recent discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , it still provides an estimate of the computational cost of simulating such states using a tn ( c.f . the related discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "as a benchmark , we have considered the transition between the eight - vertex and the six - vertex model in terms of the rk wave function of the corresponding lgt .",
    "we have shown that , while the transition is correctly detected by the behavior of the entanglement entropy , it is hard to detect it by observing the behavior of the schmidt gap and the lower part of the entanglement spectrum .",
    "we envisage that the tools that we have developed will play an important role in the characterization of the real time dynamics in lgt , and in the quest for finding model displaying stable topological phases even at finite temperature .",
    "all the recent developments about the characterization of topological phases in terms of 2d tn such as the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite can be easily applied to our construction as we plan to in the near future .",
    "recently , gauge magnets have received a lot of attention from the amo community , due to the possibility of implementing them in experiments based on the emerging new quantum technologies such as cold - atoms , trapped ions etc @xcite .",
    "there is still a large room for improvement on these first proposals and the tools we have designed will help in this task .",
    "we have indeed just become aware that a new proposal for simulating @xmath290 lgt along the lines of our discussion has already been independently designed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our analysis is just the starting point in the development of a tn approach to lgt . in particular ,",
    "questions relevant for high - energy lgt like , e.g. , taking the continuous limit , have not been addressed here and constitute a logic next step to be done .",
    "some of such questions are subject of an ambitious collaborative project , coordinated by tobias osborne , that is open to contributions and available on - line @xcite .",

    "<S> we discuss how to formulate lattice gauge theories in the tensor network language . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we obtain both a consistent - truncation scheme of the kogut - susskind lattice gauge theories and a tensor network variational ansatz for gauge invariant states that can be used in actual numerical computations . </S>",
    "<S> our construction is also applied to the simplest realization of the quantum link models / gauge magnets , and provides a clear way to understand their microscopic relation with the kogut - susskind lattice gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce a new set of gauge invariant operators that modify continuously rokshar - kivelson wave functions , and can be used to extend the phase diagrams of known models . as an example we characterize the transition between the deconfined phase of the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory and the rokshar - kivelson point of the u(1 ) gauge magnet in 2d in terms of entanglement entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the topological entropy serves as an order parameter for the transition , but not the schmidt gap .    </S>",
    "<S> tensor network ( tn ) techniques are starting to play an important role in our understanding of many - body quantum systems , both on the lattice and in the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> they can be used as a framework to classify the phases of quantum matter @xcite , or as powerful numerical ansatz in actual computations of 1d @xcite and 2d strongly correlated quantum magnets @xcite , fermionic systems @xcite , or anyonic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have also recently made their way into quantum chemistry as computational tool to study the structure of molecules from the first principles @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while numerical simulations based on monte carlo ( mc ) are still the most successful techniques in some of these fields , tns start to provide viable alternatives to them , particularly in those contexts where mc has troubles , such as the physics of frustrated anti - ferromagnets @xcite , and the real time evolution of out of equilibrium systems @xcite .    at present </S>",
    "<S> , the main limitation of numerical tn techniques is that the cost of the simulations increases rapidly with the amount of correlations in the system ( which is encoded in the bond dimension @xmath1 of the elementary tensors ) , and thus tns tend to be biased towards weakly correlated phases .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the steady improvement of the tn algorithms @xcite makes us confident that these limitations will soon be overcome , and as a consequence tn will become more and more useful in the physics of quantum many - body systems . among interesting quantum many - body systems , we focus here on gauge theories , a context in which tn </S>",
    "<S> have recently made a spectacular debut @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> gauge theories ( gt ) @xcite describe three of the four fundamental interactions ( electromagnetic , weak , and strong interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , strong interactions , are described by an @xmath2 gauge theory , called quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> gt also allow to understand emergent phenomena at low energies in condensed matter systems , e.g. anti - ferromagnets @xcite and high - temperature superconductors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams of gt , similarly to those of most strongly correlated many - body quantum systems , are still debated . </S>",
    "<S> still , there are exactly solvable gt that display topological phases . </S>",
    "<S> recently , topological states have been proposed as possible hardware for quantum computers , and thus there is an urgent need for clarification of generic gt phase diagrams where these states could appear @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> wilson s formulation of lattice gauge theories ( lgt ) @xcite was obtained by substituting the continuous space - time with a discrete set of points ( the lattice ) . </S>",
    "<S> it provided the breakthrough that has allowed to develop numerical tools based on mc , able to address the strong coupling regime of gt . </S>",
    "<S> these tools are , as today , the main resource to compare various aspects of qcd at strong - coupling with experiments @xcite . those aspects of qcd that are hard or impossible to address with mc are indeed in most of the cases still unclear . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the mechanism of charge confinement @xcite , invented to explain the absence of isolated quarks @xcite , still stands as a conjecture in full qcd , four decades since it was first understood in abelian models . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , mc simulations struggle to address hot and dense nuclear matter @xcite , probed by heavy nuclei collisions at cern and rhic @xcite . in their current formulation mc simulations of lgt </S>",
    "<S> can not be used to characterize the real time out of equilibrium dynamics of gt .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is two - fold . </S>",
    "<S> on one side we develop the theory of tns for lgt with arbitrary groups . on the other </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a constructive approach to lgt using the tn formalism ( reviewed in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : tn ] ) . in this framework , tn are used as a model - building tool that , given a group @xmath3 , allows to design the most general gauge invariant theory out of the simple knowledge of the group representation matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on reformulating very simple results about the theory of group representations ( reviewed in sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : gt ] ) in the tn formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we use the approach in which lgt differ from standard many - body quantum systems due to the presence of a large amount of local symmetry constraints ( sec . [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : lgt ] ) , which arise as a consequence of generalizations of the gauss law . </S>",
    "<S> one of the guiding principles in designing lgt will thus be the possibility of defining such local symmetry constraints ( sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : lgth ] and sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : lgt_gt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we identify the `` physical hilbert space '' , @xmath4 , as the space of states that fulfill those constraints ( sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : lgt_ph ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these constraints can be naturally embedded in a tn . </S>",
    "<S> we thus construct an exact projector onto @xmath4 as a tn ( sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : proj_tn ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we re - derive , with our formalism , the elementary gauge invariant operators ( sec . [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : g_inv_op ] ) necessary to describe the dynamics inside @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> in the course of our discussion we explain that continuous groups are associated to infinite dimensional local hilbert spaces , and thus the tn network construction for them has infinite bond dimension @xmath1 , and thus is computationally intractable .    in order to cure this </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a scheme that allows to truncate , in a gauge invariant way , the infinite dimensional local hilbert spaces . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a version of the ks lgt for ( compact ) continuous groups defined on finite dimensional hilbert spaces ( sec . [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : t_ks ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the projector onto @xmath4 for these models can be expressed as a tn with finite bond dimension , and can thus be used in practical computations .    </S>",
    "<S> we review the alternative constructions of lgt with continuous gauge symmetry and discrete local hilbert spaces , called gauge magnets ( or link models ) @xcite ( sec . [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : gm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize it to arbitrary groups and we show that in the non - abelian case , the gauge magnets are not equivalent to a local gauge invariant truncation of the ks lgt .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> we are able to introduce a general tn variational ansatz for lgt , with both discrete and continuous groups , that again automatically embeds all local constraints dictated by the gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the states described by this ansatz are indeed gauge symmetric by construction . </S>",
    "<S> gauge - symmetry constraints , indeed , allow to restrict the attention to @xmath4 , which is still , however , exponentially large as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hilb_emb ] . </S>",
    "<S> low - energy states of local gauge invariant hamiltonians are expected to live only on a small region of @xmath4 , in the same way as low - energy states of generic local hamiltonians live in a small region of the unconstrained hilbert space , since they fulfill the `` area - law '' for the entanglement @xcite .     of a quantum many - body system ( represented here by a 3d box ) </S>",
    "<S> is exponentially large , since it is the tensor product of the hilbert spaces of the constituents . </S>",
    "<S> gauge symmetry allows to identify a smaller space that we call the _ physical hilbert space _ @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the subspace spanned by those states that fulfill all the local constraints imposed by the gauge symmetry and is represented by a membrane inside @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is smaller than the full @xmath6 but it is still exponentially large . </S>",
    "<S> low - energy states of local gauge invariant hamiltonians , however , are expected to live in a small corner of @xmath5 , in the same way as low - energy states of generic local hamiltonians live in a small corner of @xmath6 @xcite . for this reason we design a variational ansatz based on tn that allows to explore this small corner of @xmath5 ( orange oval ) . by increasing the bond dimension of the elementary tensors in the tn ( @xmath7 ) </S>",
    "<S> we can explore increasingly large regions of @xmath5 , and eventually for @xmath8 we can cover the whole @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the projector on @xmath4 , and a family of interesting rokshar - kivelson ( rk ) states , are obtained exactly with tn with minimal bond dimension that scales as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dimension of the local hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hilb_emb ] ]    we explicitly construct a tn ansatz that allows to explore this small corner of @xmath5 ( sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : var_anst ] ) . in its simplest form </S>",
    "<S> , the tn ansatz requires the same bond dimension as the projector onto @xmath4 . in this case @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the dimension of the local hilbert space , and it allows to characterize the physics of generalized rokshar - kivelson states ( rk ) @xcite . by increasing the bond dimension </S>",
    "<S> , one can gradually explore all the space of gauge invariant states @xmath4 , as represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hilb_emb ] , by increasingly large orange circles .    </S>",
    "<S> the tn ansatz depends on several elementary tensors , each made by two distinguished parts . </S>",
    "<S> one part is completely determined by the gauge - symmetry constraints , while the other contains the free parameters to be used in variational calculations . as in the case of globally invariant tn @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , our formalism allows to unveil interesting connections between gauge symmetric quantum states and spin networks @xcite .    as a further application </S>",
    "<S> we define gauge invariant vertex operators @xcite for arbitrary gauge theories ( sec . [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : vertex_op ] ) . in this way we open new possibilities to use them as extensions of the standard hamiltonians in order to explore extended phase diagrams of the known models .    </S>",
    "<S> we benchmark these new tools in the context of rk states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we focus on the recent proposals about the characterization of quantum phases based on the analysis of the entanglement scaling of the ground state wave function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the well known transition between the eight - vertex and the six - vertex models . in the gauge theory language </S>",
    "<S> this transition is induced by applying the vertex operators @xcite onto the rk @xmath11 wavefunctions . in this way we provide an example of phase transition between a @xmath11 gapped spin liquid and a @xmath12 algebraic spin liquid that is detected by the topological entropy , but elusive for the lowest part of the entanglement spectrum ( sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : num_res ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> all the discussion about connections of our results with other works in the literature is postponed to sec . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : about ] , and we conclude with a summary of our results and an outlook on future developments in sec . [ </S>",
