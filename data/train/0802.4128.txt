    "the highly virtual photons collision is a very clean process to probe the bfkl effects since it provides small transverse size objects ( @xmath10 color dipoles ) which overcome the theoretical problem arising from diffusion of the transverse momenta in the bfkl equation , at least in non asymptotical @xmath8 .",
    "we can select events with comparable photon virtualities to avoid the partonic evolution of dglap @xcite type .",
    "several studies @xcite have been performed at the level of the @xmath1 total cross - section and @xmath11 meson pairs production in @xmath12 collisions . here",
    "we focus on the exclusive process @xmath13 ( see fig.[impact ] ) through @xmath14 with double tagged outgoing leptons .",
    "the @xmath2-factorization of the scattering amplitude , valid at high energy , has the form of a convolution in the transverse momentum @xmath15 space between the two impact factors , corresponding to the transition of @xmath16 via the @xmath9channel exchange of two reggeized gluons ( with momenta @xmath15 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "the virtualities ( @xmath18 ) of the photons supply the hard scale which justifies the use of perturbation theory to compute in the collinear factorization the hard part of each impact factor , convoluted with the soft part ( encoding the hadronization into the final states @xmath19 mesons ) which is given by the corresponding leading twist distribution amplitude ( da)@xcite .",
    "r0.45        ( 10,20 ) ( 85,10)@xmath20  @xmath21 ( 0,125)@xmath22 ( 86,90)@xmath23 ( 86,72)@xmath24 ( 86,58)@xmath25 ( 86,42)@xmath26    [ figlogcurves ]    we display in fig.[figlogcurves ] the non - forward born order cross - sections as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath27 for the different @xmath28 polarizations , having performed analytically the integrations over @xmath15 ( using conformal transformations to reduce the number of massless propagators ) and numerically the integration over the accessible phase space @xcite .",
    "we then obtained the corresponding cross - section of the process @xmath29 in the planned experimental conditions of the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "we focus on the ldc detector project and we use the potential of the very forward region accessible through the electromagnetic calorimeter beamcal . following the requirements of regge kinematics , we fix the value of @xmath8 on the gluon exchange dominance over the quark exchange contribution calculated in @xcite . with the foreseen energy of the collider @xmath30 gev and nominal integrated luminosity of @xmath31 , this will yield around @xmath32 events per year , depending on the theoretical asumptions we have made ( scale dependence of @xmath33 , value of the parameter that controls the regge kinematics and expansion of das ) .",
    "the results obtained at born approximation can be considered as the starting point for evaluation of the cross - section for @xmath0 mesons pairs production with complete bfkl evolution taken into account .",
    "we first evaluate bfkl evolution in the leading logarithms approximation ( ll ) which dramatically enhances ( by several orders of magnitude ) the cross - section ( and also the theoretical uncertainties coming mainly from the definition of the rapidity and the scale dependence of @xmath33 ) when increasing @xmath34 , because of the large value of the ll bfkl pomeron intercept .    r0.5        ( 10,10 ) ( 0,120)@xmath35    [ fignll - papatmin ]    r0.45        ( 10,9.8 ) ( 130,7)@xmath36   @xmath37 $ ] ( 0,120)@xmath38    [ fignlotmin ]    the next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) bfkl evolution will widely reduce both this enhancement and uncertainties , which is essential to make precise predictions . the full nll cross - section @xcite , with both impact factors and bfkl kernel computed in the nll accuracy , can even be lower at moderate values of @xmath8 than its born order approximation .",
    "we use the renormalization group improved bfkl kernel @xcite ( convoluted with ll impact factors ) to estimate the nll differential cross - section of @xmath39 , which gives a good agreement with the full nll evolution obtained in @xcite , as we can see in fig.[fignll - papatmin ] . in the approach of ref.@xcite , we must find the solutions ( the nll pomeron intercept and the anomalous dimension ) of a set of two coupled equations ( coming from the saddle point approximation and the residue of the integral over @xmath40 , the mellin moment of @xmath8 ) .",
    "although this approach uses a fixed strong coupling , we reconstruct in @xmath41 and @xmath42 a scale dependence by fitting with polynomials of @xmath43 a large range of solutions obtained for various values of @xmath44 .",
    "our results are now much less sensitive to the various theoretical asumptions than the ones obtained at ll accuracy . having integrated over the accessible phase space of this reaction at ilc",
    ", we compare in fig.[fignlotmin ] the curves at born order ( green ) with the ( red ) one obtained after collinear improved bfkl resummation .",
    "the experimental cut imposed by the resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter beamcal is responsible for the fall of the cross - sections with @xmath34 increasing from @xmath45 gev .",
    "this nll evolution gives an enhancement of the born approximation by a factor @xmath46 , which allows us to definitively conclude of the measurability of the bfkl evolution for this process at ilc .",
    "we finally mention that increasing the collider energy from @xmath45 gev to @xmath47 tev will probably lead to a transition between the linear and the saturated regime ( @xmath48 gev for @xmath49 tev ) .",
