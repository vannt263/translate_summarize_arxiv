    "<S> in addition to the intensity response of the optomechanical cavity there is the phase response , which provides a measure of the group delay of the modulated optical signal beam as it passes through the cavity . for the @xmath45 modulation of the signal beam used in our experiments , </S>",

    "<S> as can be seen in this data , the maximum measured transmission delay is @xmath49  ns , which although corresponds to significant slowing of light to a velocity of @xmath50  m / s through the few micron long structure , is much smaller than the measured reflected signal advance or the limit set by the intrinsic mechanical damping ( @xmath51  @xmath52s ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the weak loading of the optical cavity in these experiments ( see appendix a ) , and the resulting small fraction of transmitted light that actually passes through the cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the observed eit - like behavior of the optomechanical system , a similar phenomena to that of electromagentic induced absorption ( eia )  @xcite in atomic systems can be realized by setting the detuning of the control beam to the blue side of the optomechanical cavity resonance ( @xmath53 ) . under blue - detuned pumping , </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian for the optical signal and mechanical phonon mode becomes one of parametric amplification , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured reflection spectrum from the omc is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d , where the reflectivity of the cavity system is seen to be enhanced around the two - photon detuning @xmath55 , a result of the increased `` absorption '' ( feeding ) of photons into the cavity . as discussed further in the appendix a , at even higher control beam powers such that @xmath56 , the system switches from eia to parametric amplification , resulting in optical signal amplification , and eventually phonon - lasing .    </S>",
    "<S> reflection spectroscopy at room temperature ( @xmath28  k ) of the optomechanical cavity has also been performed ( presented in the appendix d ) , and yields similar results to that of the cryogenic measurements , albeit with a larger value of @xmath10 required to reach a given cooperativity ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig3]e ) due to the larger intrinsic mechanical dissipation at room temperature ( @xmath57 ) . beyond the initial demonstrations of eit and eia behaviour in the omc cavities presented here , it is fruitful to consider the bandwidth and signal delay limits that might be attainable with future improvements in device material or geometry . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the transparency bandwidth of the current devices is limited by two - photon absorption of the control beam in the silicon cavities ; a move to larger bandgap dielectric materials , such as silicon nitride , should allow intra - cavity photon numbers of @xmath58 ( limited by linear material absorption ) , resulting in a transparency window approaching @xmath59(1  ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , recent research into low - loss ghz mechanic resonators  @xcite should enable slow light optical delays approaching @xmath60s at room temperature , roughly a path length of a kilometer of optical fiber . </S>",
    "<S> much like the acoustic wave devices used in electronic systems  @xcite , optomechanical devices with these attributes would enable chip - scale microwave photonic systems capable of advanced signal processing in the optical domain , such as that needed for emerging broadband wireless access networks or more specialized applications such as true - time delays in radar systems  @xcite .    the limiting factor for quantum applications of optomechanical systems is the re - thermalization time of the mechanical resonator , @xmath61 , which in the case of a quantum optical memory represents the average storage time of a single photon before excitation of the system by a thermal bath phonon . for the devices studied here , despite the small optically - cooled phonon occupancy of the resonator ( @xmath62 phonons from the measured cooperativity ) , the re - thermalization time is only @xmath63  ns at the measurement temperature of @xmath0  k ( @xmath64  ps at room temperature ) . reducing the operating temperature further to a value below @xmath65  mk ( routinely attained in a dilution refigerator ) , would not only increase the re - thermalization time through a lower bath temperature , but should also result in a significant increase in the mechanical @xmath20-factor . </S>",
    "<S> taken together , the resulting re - thermalization time in the current omc devices at @xmath66  mk is likely to be on the order of @xmath65  @xmath52s , which although not nearly as long as what has been achieved in atomic systems  @xcite , still represents a substantial storage time compared to the realizable ghz bandwidth of the system . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , optomechanical processes similar to the eit behavior measured here have also been proposed  @xcite to provide an optical interface between , for instance , atomic and superconducting circuit quantum systems , enabling the formation of hybrid quantum networks . </S>"
