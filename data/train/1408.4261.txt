    "<S> so far , various kinds of techniques such as weight measurement method of crystal or melt , measurement method of meniscus shape , measurement method of melt height , etc . , for automatically controlling the diameter of crystal , have been exploited , and computer simulations such as mc , md , fea , etc . , for optimizing the growth condition have been widely studied[@xcite-@xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> but those simulations have analyzed the crystal growth process only for static states because of the complexities of physico - chemical properties and the limited computer performance of cz crystal growth system . </S>",

    "<S> recently , studies on computer simulation control such as pid control , model prediction control(mpc ) for optimizing the control of crystal growth were developed , but they could not exactly represent realistic feature of cz crystal growth system due to mismatching between model and control system[@xcite-@xcite ] . </S>"
