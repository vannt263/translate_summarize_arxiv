    "success of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite for the ground - state calculations had prompted search @xcite for similar theories for the excited - states . over the past decade , time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite has become a standard tool @xcite for obtaining transition energies and the associated oscillator strengths .",
    "however , despite it s widespread use , the theory is not without limitations .",
    "for example , if adiabatic approximations are applied for the exchange - correlation kernel , excitation energies for double excitation of electrons can not be obtained @xcite within tddft ; obtaining these still remains @xcite a challenge in the tddft approach . at the same time , the charm of getting the excitation energy as the difference between two total energies remains .",
    "this is because one can choose the excited - state at will , promoting as many electrons as one wishes to a set of chosen orbitals , calculate the corresponding total energy and find the excitation energy by subtracting the ground - state energy from it ; we refer the reader to the works of ziegler et al @xcite , von barth @xcite and gunnarsson and jones @xcite for some of the early attempts to apply this approach to study low excitation energies . thus research in the direction of performing a kohn - sham like calculation for the excited - states continues .",
    "a ground - state like dft approach to obtain the total energy of an excited - state has been developed by grling @xcite and by levy and nagy @xcite . the theory is based on the constrained - search approach @xcite and proposes that the energy of an excited - state can also be written as a functional @xmath0 = f[\\rho,\\rho_{0 } ] + \\int\\rho({\\bf r})v_{ext}({\\bf r})d{\\bf r } \\label{1}\\ ] ] of the excited - state density @xmath1 . here @xmath2 $ ] is a bi - density functional that depends on the ground - state density @xmath3 also , and @xmath4 is the external potential that the electrons are moving in .",
    "the bi - density functional for the density @xmath5 of the @xmath6 excited - state is defined via the constrained - search formulation as @xmath7 = { \\rm min}_{\\psi \\to \\rho } \\left < \\psi | { \\hat t } +   { \\hat v}_{ee}|\\psi \\right > \\ ; , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is orthogonal to the lower @xmath9 states of the hamiltonian , already determined by the density @xmath3 . such a way of obtaining the functional @xmath2 $ ] makes it non - universal and also state - dependent . the exchange - correlation energy",
    "functional @xmath10 $ ] for the excited - state is then obtained by subtracting from @xmath2 $ ] the non - interacting kinetic energy @xmath11 $ ] and the coulomb energy @xmath12 $ ] corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "the non - interacting kinetic energy @xmath11 $ ] is defined in a manner similar to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) by dropping the operator @xmath13 from the right hand side .",

    "( [ 4 ] ) the various terms have their standard meaning with @xmath19 representing the exchange - correlation potential for the excited - state .",
    "it is determined by taking the functional derivative of the excited - state exchange - correlation energy functional . that a kohn - sham like calculation can be performed for the excited - states",
    "was first proposed by harbola and sahni @xcite on physical grounds , and has been put @xcite on a rigorous mathematical footing recently on the basis of differential virial theorem @xcite .",
    "calculations of excited - state energies based on the harbola - sahni work have yielded excellent results @xcite .",
    "the near exact exchange - correlation potential for the singlet @xmath20 and triplet @xmath21 excited - state of helium has also been constructed @xcite recently .",
    "however , we are not aware of any work where an exchange - correlation functional for the excited - states has been reported ; in performing excited - state calculations @xcite , either the ground - state functionals or the orbital based - theories @xcite have been employed .",
    "the proposition for the construction of an excited - state exchange - correlation functional is indeed a difficult one since the functional is non - universal and also state - dependent .",
    "thus a general functional form for it may not exist .",
    "against such a background , we ask if it is at all possible to obtain a simple lda - like functional for the excited - states . to keep matters simple ,",
    "we have been looking at this problem within the exchange - only approximation . in this paper",
    "we show that it is indeed possible to construct an exchange energy functional that gives transition energies comparable to the exact exchange - only theories such as hartree - fock @xcite , optimized potential @xcite or the harbola - sahni @xcite theory .",
    "the construction of the functional is based on the homogeneous electron - gas and in finding the final form of the functional we are guided mostly by qualitative plausibility arguments .",
    "our work is thus exploratory in nature and represents probably the first attempt to construct an excited - state exchange - energy functional in terms of the density .",
    "the evidence of the accuracy of the functional constructed by us is given by the results of the transition energies of a large number of excited - states .",
    "we also refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for an expression for the change in the exchange energy in terms of the ground - state kohn - sham orbitals when an electron is promoted from a lower energy orbital to a higher one .    in the present work",
    "we take a particular class of excited states in which some core orbital are filled , then there are some vacant orbitals and again there are some filled orbitals .",
    "we construct an lda - like functional for such states in the following section .",
    "as stated above , we now consider such excited - states where the occupation of the orbitals is such that the electrons occupy some core orbitals and some shell orbitals , leaving the orbitals between the core and the shell regions vacant .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "( [ k - space ] ) .",
    "such an excited - state would be obtained , for example , if an electron from the filled orbitals of the ground - state is excited to just above the occupied levels .",
    "the exact exchange energy for a set of occupied orbitals is given as @xmath22 so the excited - state exchange energy when an electron is transferred from one of the orbitals occupied in the ground - state to the lowest unoccupied level is @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the orbital from which the electron has been removed and @xmath25 where the electron is added .",
    "the sum over the index @xmath26 in the second term on the right hand side runs over all the orbitals that are occupied in the ground - state and @xmath25 . on the other hand",
    "the sum in the fifth term runs only over the orbitals occupied in the ground - state .",
    "we now attempt to make an lda - like approximation for the excited - state exchange energy so that the difference ( the last four terms in the equation above ) between the approximate excited- and ground - state exchange energies is close to that given by the exact expression above . in making this approximation accurate , it is evident that the self - energy terms ( third and fourth terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) ) for the orbitals @xmath24 and @xmath25 are to be treated accurately .    as the first step towards an excited - state functional , we make the correspondence between the excited - states that we are considering and similar excitations in a homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) .",
    "if the heg is in it s ground state , the electrons are filled up to the fermi level so that the electrons occupy wave - vectors in @xmath27 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , where @xmath5 is the electron density . on the other hand , in an excited state of the system the electrons will occupy @xmath27 differently from the ground state . for the kind of excited - states that we consider in this paper , the corresponding occupation in the @xmath27 is as follows :",
    "the electrons occupy orbitals from @xmath28 to @xmath30 and @xmath31 to @xmath32 with a gap in between as shown in fig .",

    "( [ a ] ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the core and shell electron density , and in eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) , @xmath39 is the density of the vacant orbitals that lie between the core and the shell regions of occupied orbitals .",
    "the exchange energy for the heg that occupies the @xmath27 as described above can be obtained exactly and is given as ( mlda stands for modified local - density approximation ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 \\label{11}\\ ] ] is the exchange energy of the core electrons , @xmath42 \\label{12}\\ ] ] is the exchange energy of the electrons in the shell , and @xmath43 \\label{13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] represents the exchange energy of interaction between the core and the shell electrons . here",
    "@xmath44 is the volume of the heg . after adding the three terms",
    ", the exchange - energy can also be written in the form @xmath45d{\\bf r }   -\\frac{1}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int\\left[(k_{3}^{2}-k_{2}^{2})^{2}\\;ln\\left(\\frac{k_{3}+k_{2}}{k_{3}-k_{2}}\\right)\\right]d{\\bf r } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int\\left[(k_{2}^{2}-k_{1}^{2})^{2}\\;ln\\left(\\frac{k_{2}+k_{1}}{k_{2}-k_{1}}\\right)\\right]d{\\bf r } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{1}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int\\left[(k_{3}^{2}-k_{1}^{2})^{2}\\;ln\\left(\\frac{k_{3}+k_{1}}{k_{3}-k_{1}}\\right)\\right]d{\\bf r } \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 represents the exchange - energy per particle when the heg is in its ground - state with the fermi momentum equal to @xmath47 .",
    "the equation above has a nice interpretation : the integral on the right - hand side represents the exchange energy of the system of electrons with density @xmath5 when per electron energy is written as @xmath48 $ ] , i.e. the per electron energy is given according to the occupation in the @xmath27 ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath49 terms , on the other hand , have no such simple interpretation .",
    "they have the kinetic energy density in them but we have not been able to write the terms in as easy a form as the first term .",
    "that the functional above has all the right limits if we take @xmath50 or @xmath51 is easily verified .",
    "finally , the modified local - spin density ( lsd ) functional @xmath52 $ ] in terms of the spin densities @xmath53 and @xmath54 is easily obtained from the functional above as @xmath55 = \\frac{1}{2}e_{x}^{mlda } [ 2\\rho^{\\alpha } ] + \\frac{1}{2}e_{x}^{mlda}[2\\rho^{\\beta } ]   \\label{lsda}\\ ] ]    having derived the exchange functional for the heg , we now apply it to the excited - states of various atoms to check if the functional above gives exchange energy differences accurately .",
    "the excited - states chosen are such that they can be represented by a single slater determinant so that the lda is expected to be a good approximation @xcite for them .",
    "the different radii in the @xmath27 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) needed to evaluate the exchange energy are found by eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) , ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) . for each state ( ground and excited ) , the same set of orbitals @xcite is employed to get the hartree - fock and the lsd exchange energies .",
    "we calculate the lsd and mlsd exchange energies using spherical spin densities since the effect of non - sphericity on the total exchange energy should be small @xcite.this is because of the fact that in the levy - nagy formalism @xcite , the excited - state energy is obtained through variational minimization",
    ". therefore inclusion of non - sphericity in the density would not cause as large a change in the total excited - state energy as the use of an appropriate exchange energy functional .",
    "indeed the results for the lowest lying multiplets also indicate this @xcite .    in table 1 , we show the difference between the excited - state exchange energy and the ground - state exchange energy for some atoms and ions . in the first column",
    "we give the difference as obtained by the hartree - fock expression for the exchange energy . in the second column ,",
    "the numbers are given for both the excited - state and the ground - state exchange energies obtained by employing the ground - state lsd functional .",
    "the third column gives the exchange energy difference when the excited - state exchange energy is calculated using the functional of eq .",
    "( [ lsda ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the ground - state lsd approximation underestimates this energy difference .",
    "this is not surprising since the ground - state functional would give a larger exchange energy for the excited - state than what a proper excited - state functional should give .",
    "however , when the functional of eq .",
    "( [ lsda ] ) is employed to calculate the exchange energy for the excited - states we find , to our surprise , that for the majority of the atoms the functional overestimates the differences by a large amount , whereas we expected to find the error to be about @xmath56 which is the general lda exchange energy error .",
    "we note that this large difference can not come because we have spherical densities .",
    "if non - spherical densities are used , the difference may increase even further .",
    "for example , for the fluorine atom , the ground - state exchange energy will become more negative for non - spherical densities .",
    "on the other hand , the excited - state exchange energy will remain unchanged since the density is already spherical .",
    "this will result in an even larger difference in the exchange energies of the two states .",
    "we now look for possible sources of error in the exchange - energy differences when the functional of eq .",
    "( [ lsda ] ) is employed to get the exchange energy for the excited - states . for this",
    "we examine eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) in which the last four terms on the right hand side represent the exchange energy difference .",
    "thus @xmath57 it is the lda values to this term that are given in table 1 .",
    "the source of error in this term we suspect is the lda treatment of the self - exchange energies of the orbitals @xmath24 and @xmath25 involved in the electron transfer . to make the functional more accurate we make the self - interaction correction ( sic ) for both these orbitals",
    "this is done by subtracting @xcite @xmath58 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\int\\frac{|\\phi({\\bf r}_{1})|^{2 }     |\\phi({\\bf r}_{2})|^{2})}{|{\\bf r}_{1}-{\\bf r}_{2}|}d{\\bf r}_{1}d{\\bf r}_{2 }     + e_{x}^{lsd}[\\rho(\\phi)]\\ ; , \\label{16}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the orbital density for the orbital @xmath60 , from the @xmath61 functional .",
    "thus the final expression for the exchange - energy that we have is @xmath62-e_{x}^{sic}[\\phi_{add}]\\ ; \\label{18}\\ ] ] this gives the exchange energy difference between the excited - state and the ground - state to be @xmath63-e^{lsd}_{x}[\\rho_{ground } ] -e^{sic}_{x}[\\phi_{rem}]-e^{sic}_{x}[\\phi_{add}]\\ ; \\label{18a}\\ ] ] we have also computed the exchange energy differences given by the functional in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) and shown them in table 1 . as is evident from the numbers displayed there , the functional of eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) gives highly accurate exchange - energy differences for all the systems considered .",
    "when the exchange - energy difference between the ground- and the excited - state is small , the hf , lsd and the functionals derived above , all give roughly the same results .",
    "however , when this difference is large , the lda underestimates the magnitude of the difference by a large amount whereas the functional of eq .",
    "( [ lsda ] ) overestimates it .",
    "only when the latter is corrected for the self - interaction then the difference is almost the same as the hartree - fock difference .",
    "notice that sic is made only for the orbitals involved in the transition .",
    "thus despite this explicit orbital dependence , the functional is still quite simple and easy to deal with .",
    "making the self - interaction correction may deceptively lead the reader to momentarily think that our approach may be nothing more than treating the exchange energy within the siclda approach for both the ground and the excited - states .",
    "however , this is not so .",
    "if the siclda exchange energy functional is used , the difference between the exchange energies for the two states would be ( for keeping the expression simple , we are using the same set of orbitals for the two states ) : @xmath64-e^{lsd}_{x}[\\rho_{ground } ] + e^{sic}_{x}[\\phi_{rem}]-e^{sic}_{x}[\\phi_{add}]\\ ; \\label{16a}\\ ] ] expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ 18a ] ) and ( [ 16a ] ) differ in two significant ways : first , the exchange energy functionals used for the ground and excited states are different , and secondly @xmath65 $ ] is subtracted in eq .",
    "( [ 18a ] ) whereas it is added in eq .",
    "( [ 16a ] ) . a careful look at eq .",
    "( [ 16a ] ) also indicates that the excited - state energies in siclda scheme should not come out to be any different from those obtained from the lda calculations , because @xmath66 for the two orbitals involved in the transition would tend to cancel .",
    "this is what has been observed in the past @xcite .",
    "we note that we do have a choice of writing the first and the second terms in eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) as @xmath67 and then make the self - interaction correction for the orbital @xmath24 .",
    "however , that would bring @xmath65 $ ] with a positive sign in @xmath68 , and the resulting functional will not be as accurate . although we do not fully understand why this happens , we now give a qualitative argument as to why the functional of eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) gives accurate exchange energy differences .",
    "we feel that the lda should be reasonably accurate when the integral over @xmath69 is continuous . as written in eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) , the sum in the first term is continuous except for the exchange term involving @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus the lda to the first term should be reasonably accurate .",
    "this brings in the self - interaction energy of the electron removed with a negative sign in front . by including the self - interaction correction for the removed electron only , we find that the error in the exchange energy difference reduces to about @xmath56 of the corresponding hf value . to make the difference even more accurate",
    ", we now consider the term for the orbital @xmath25 where the electron is added . there ,",
    "when the lda is made , the electron comes in with its self - interaction so for the added orbital too @xmath70 should be subtracted to make the results for the energy difference comparable to the hartree - fock results .    having obtained the functional to calculate accurate exchange energy difference",
    ", we now apply it to a large number of excited - states of the class considered here and find that we get the transition energies very close to those given by the hartree - fock theory .",
    "we employ the exchange functional @xmath68 proposed above to obtain the transition energies for a variety of excitations in different atoms .",
    "we find that for all the systems the transition energies obtained by us are very close to the corresponding hartree - fock energies @xcite .",
    "our calculations proceed as follows : ( a ) we get the ground - state energy by solving the kohn - sham equation with the effective exchange potential calculated using the dirac formula @xcite .",
    "( b ) we then solve the kohn - sham equation with the same ( corresponding to the ground - state ) functional for the excited - state configuration .",
    "this gives us the excited - state energy @xmath71 , and the lsd exchange energy @xmath72 for the excited - state .",
    "the difference between @xmath71 and the ground - state energy @xmath73 gives us the transition energy @xmath74 .",
    "( c ) we then employ the kohn - sham orbitals from the excited - state lsd calculation to get the modified lsd exchange energy including sic by employing the functional @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "( d ) the modified transition energy @xmath75 is then given as @xmath76 although we have not performed self - consistent calculations with the new functional , self - consistency is not expected to affect the results significantly .",
    "this is because , as we shall see in the results , the major difference in the transition energies given by different functionals arises from the difference in the value of the exchange energy itself .",
    "we also compare our results with the transition energies obtained by the exchange - only time - dependent density - funcitional theory ( tddft ) applied within the single - pole approximation .",
    "we find that our results are comparable to the tddft results . in the following ,",
    "we have considered three different cases of electron transfer : electron making a transition from an ` s ' to a ` p ' orbital ; from an ` s ' to a ` d ' orbital and from a ` p ' to a ` d ' orbital .      in this section",
    "we consider the cases when one or two electrons are transferred from an inner @xmath77 orbital to an outer @xmath78 orbital . shown in table 2",
    "are the transition energies @xmath79 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for some light atoms and ions when one of their inner electrons is excited to the lowest available orbital .",
    "the excitation energy in these systems is such that for some of them @xmath74 is close to @xmath79 but for others it is not .",
    "however , @xmath75 is uniformly accurate for all the systems .",
    "we note that the error in @xmath74 is almost fully from the error in the corresponding exchange energy difference .",
    "this is evident from a comparison of the numbers in table 1 ( for the exchange energy differences ) and in table 2 .",
    "thus major difference in @xmath80 comes from the error in calculating the exchange energy .",
    "as noted earlier , self - consistency effects are much smaller compared to the differences arising from the use of the ground - state exchange energy functional for the excited - state also .",
    "our results also match well with , and in some cases are better than , the tddft results shown in the last column of the table .    in table 3 , we look at the excitation energies of the alkali atoms and @xmath81 by exciting an electron from the uppermost orbital to an outer orbital . these are weakly bound systems and as such their excitation energies are relatively smaller .",
    "thus they provide a good testing ground for the proposed functional . an interesting point about these systems",
    "is that the lsd itself gives excitation energies close to the hf excitation energies .",
    "it is therefore quite gratifying to see that the transition energies obtained by the new functional also are of very good quality , although the present method tends to slightly overestimate the transition energies .",
    "the tddft method also gives similar numbers although it overestimates the transition energies by a slightly larger amount .",
    "next we consider some bigger atoms where we can excite the electron from more than one inner orbital . shown in tables 4 and 5",
    "are the excitation energies for the atoms in the third row of the periodic table . in table 4",
    ", we consider an electron being excited from the @xmath82 orbital to the @xmath83 orbital . in all these case",
    "@xmath74 is smaller than the true energy difference whereas the present functional gives highly accurate estimates of the transition energy .",
    "notice again that the error in the value of @xmath74 arises mainly from the error in the exchange energy .",
    "the tddft results in these cases too are of quality comparable to the present method .    in table 5",
    ", we show the transition energies for the same set of atoms and ions as in table 4 , but for the electron now being excited from the @xmath84 orbital to the @xmath83 orbital .",
    "consequently the energy of excitation is much larger in this case .",
    "the lsd in all these cases underestimates the excitation energy , whereas the present functional gives accurate results although slightly overestimating them .",
    "however , the error with respect to the lsd is reduced by a factor of @xmath85 or more .",
    "thus the proposed functional is accurate for transitions from a shallow level as well as from a deep level .",
    "we find that the tddft results in the present case are not as accurate as in the cases studied above .    shown in table 6 are the excitation energies for a group of atoms for which the lsd gives transition energies very close to the hf excitation energies . in all the cases we find that the functional proposed here is able to give accurate excitation energies .",
    "thus we find that when the lsd results are accurate , so are the results given by the new functional .",
    "what is significant , however , is that when the lsd results are poor , the new functional properly corrects the error in the lsd .    finally , we consider the cases where two electrons are excited to the higher orbitals . in this case",
    "the functional @xmath68 is evaluated by subtracting the sic energy from the @xmath86 for both the electrons . as already pointed out ,",
    "double excitations are difficult to deal with in the tddft approach to finding excitation energies , because the theory is based on the first - order perturbation theory of non - interacting particles .",
    "results for different excitations for a variety of atomic systems are shown in table 7 .",
    "as is evident from the table , for all the systems , our method gives excellent results whereas the lsd underestimates the energies . in the case of double excitations ,",
    "no comparison with the tddft results can be made because a satisfactory tddft of double excitations does not exist .",
    "in all the cases above , we have compared our results with those of hartree - fock theory and those obtained from exchange - only tddft .",
    "we do so because in our work we have not taken into account the effect of correlations .",
    "we note that although in atoms hartree - fock theory gives total energies which are very close to the experimental energies , correlation effects become relatively more important in calculating transition energies which is the difference between total energies .",
    "thus a comparison with experimental transition energies would be meaningful only after correlation effects are properly taken into account .",
    "in this section we consider the case when a @xmath82 or a @xmath83 electron is transferred to an incompletely filled @xmath87 orbital in transition metals @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the results for our calculations on these systems are shown in tables 8 and 9 .    in table 8 , numbers are shown for transitions from the @xmath82 orbital of these atoms to their @xmath87 orbital . as is clear from the table , whereas the lsd results underestimate the transfer energies , our results compare well with those of hartree - fock theory . on the other hand , we find that the tddft results also underestimate the transition energies in comparison to the hartree - fock theory results .    in table 9 , results for the transition @xmath83 @xmath90 @xmath87 are shown . since there are three down spin electrons in the @xmath83 orbital , two electrons are left in it after an electron is excited to the @xmath87 orbital .",
    "the question arises whether to treat these electrons as core electrons , as shell electrons or divide them in the core and the shell ; the three possibilities give different answers .",
    "when the electrons are treated as the core electrons , the transition energy comes out to be the smallest and it is the largest when they are treated as the shell electrons .",
    "we have taken the smallest transition energy obtained by us and compared it to the energy of transition to the largest possible l value ( so the smallest transition energy ) excited - state for a given spin . in these cases too , we find that for @xmath91 and @xmath44 , our method gives results which are better than the lsd results , but for systems with more than half filled @xmath92 , our method overestimates the transition energy whereas the lsd underestimates it .",
    "the three cases of @xmath93 and @xmath89 are where our results do not match with those of hartree - fock theory .",
    "a tough problem in calculating transfer energies is that of electron transferring from the @xmath94 orbital to the @xmath87 orbital in the transition metals considered above .",
    "the problem has been well investigated @xcite in the past and as in all the cases considered so far , lsd underestimates these energies by large amount .",
    "we have applied our functional to obtain these transfer energies to see if we could get the correct answer . however , for these @xmath95 transfer energies , our method gives hardly any improvement over the lsd results ; in fact for most of the systems , we get a transition energy which is lower than the lsd energy .",
    "furher investigations of this problem are being made .",
    "in the above we have presented a new lda - like functional for obtaining the excitation energies .",
    "it has been employed to investigate over @xmath96 excited states .",
    "the results show that our procedure gives accurate excitation energies for all of them , whereas for most of the systems the lsd underestimates the energy difference .",
    "thus we have demonstrated that it is possible to construct excited - state exchange energy functionals that are capable of giving transition energies close to the exact theory .",
    "we have worked within the exchange - only approximation and have chosen a particular class of excited - states .",
    "what we have learnt through the study reported here is that there exist exchange energy functionals of densities that are more accurate than the ground - state functional .",
    "however the structure of these functionals is not as simple as the ground - state functional .    in levy - nagy theory",
    "@xcite , while defining the bi - density functional for the excited - states through constrained search formulation @xcite ( eq .  ( [ 2 ] ) ) , the wavefunctions involved in the minimization procedure are those which are orthogonal to the lower energy wavefunctions .",
    "the latter are supposed to be determined by the ground - state density @xmath97 . in constructing our functional , by looking at the orbital occupation in the excited - states ,",
    "we occupy the @xmath27 in a similar manner , representing the unoccupied orbitals by a gap in it . thus in our case the orthogonality condition described above is taken care of , to a large extent , by the gap in the @xmath27 .",
    "this also reflects an implicit dependence on the ground - state density .",
    "we are now working on functionals for states other than those considered in this paper .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , excited - state functionals are not universal and therefore have to be dealt with separately for different kinds of excited - states .",
    "a fundamental question that still remains unanswered is why is it that representing an excited - state by the corresponding excited - state of heg does not by itself give at least as accurate exchange energies for the excited - states that the lda does for the ground - state .",
    "we do not yet have a satisfactory answer for this .",
    "what is clear however is that a combination of this functional and appropriate sic gives highly accurate results . in this work",
    ", we have also not looked at the correlation energy functionals .",
    "can correlation energy functionals be developed along similar lines ?",
    "we trust that it should be possible and are working on this problem .",
