    "<S> point imaging by a photonic crystal slab due to the negative refraction is studied theoretically . by investigating the transfer function of the imaging system </S>",
    "<S> , the influence of the surface termination to the imaging quality is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that an appropriate surface termination is important for obtaining an image of good quality .    </S>",
    "<S> a photonic crystal @xcite is an artificial structure which has a periodic arrangement of dielectric or metallic materials . </S>",
    "<S> photonic crystals have been extensively studied for their unique optical properties . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , they may provide a possibility of forbidding light propagation within a frequency band , i.e. , a photonic bandgap . </S>",
    "<S> so far , most of the studies in the literature are focused on this optical bandgap property and its applications .    as another equally important property , </S>",
    "<S> unconventional ultra - strong dispersions , e.g. , the superprism effect , exist in some photonic crystals in some frequency regions . </S>",
    "<S> such an ultra - strong dispersion was firstly reported by lin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , and demonstrated experimentally in the millimeter - wave spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> kosaka _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ then demonstrated the superprism effect in a highly dispersive photonic microstructure ( a complex `` autocloned '' photonic crystal ) at optical wavelengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these unusual properties provide an exciting possibility for obtaining microphotonic and nanophotonic devices that can focus , disperse , switch , and steer light . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the superprism effect can be used in light collimating @xcite and wavelength multiplexing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it is found that in some frequency regions some photonic crystals can also refract light as if they have a negative refractive index @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has many potential applications such as self - focusing and imaging @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different from conventional lenses , in some photonic crystals evanescent waves could be amplified due to the existence of surface modes @xcite , as well as in a left - handed material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is vital for subwavelength imaging .    in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> , we study point imaging by a two - dimensional photonic crystal slab due to the negative refraction , in particular , the influence of the surface termination of the photonic crystal slab to image quality .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional photonic crystal we considered here is a triangular lattice of air holes in a dielectric material @xmath0 , with a lattice constant @xmath1 and a hole radius @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> only the transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes are considered here . for waves at a low frequency ( or long wavelength ) , </S>",
    "<S> the material modulation of the periodic structure does not influence much the wave propagation . for waves at higher frequencies , propagation in the photonic </S>",
    "<S> crystal is complicated . </S>",
    "<S> however , bloch - floquet waves ( eigen modes in the photonic crystal ) travel through the photonic crystal with a definite propagation direction despite the presence of scattering @xcite . to visualize and analyze light propagation in a photonic crystal , an equal frequency surface ( efs ) @xcite in @xmath3 space of the photonic bands can be introduced , where gradient vectors give the group velocities of the photonic modes . for the photonic crystal considered here , </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the efs corresponding to a frequency in the second band is almost circular @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can then define an effective refractive index from the radius of the efs with snell s law @xcite and use it to describe the light refraction in the photonic crystal . to assure all - angle negative refraction , here we choose the frequency @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> at which the effective refractive index of the photonic crystal is @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the behavior in a photonic crystal with @xmath6 is quite different from that in a left - handed material(lhm)@xcite . for a lhm with @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , light can go through an air - lhm interface without reflection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may observe a quite different behavior at an interface between air and a photonic crystal even when the effective refractive index of the photonic crystal is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the transmission from air into such a photonic crystal is nearly zero even at a normal incidence when the normal of the photonic crystal surface is along @xmath8 direction ( the reason is that the incident plane wave has an even symmetry while the bloch - floquet wave in the photonic crystal has an odd symmetry ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consider an imaging system composed by a symmetric photonic crystal slab ( with a thickness of seven rows of air holes ) , which is surrounded by air . </S>",
    "<S> the imaging system with coordinates is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ slab ] , where @xmath9 is the surface termination of the photonic crystal slab at each interface . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath10 , the distance between the left boundary of the photonic crystal slab and the left boundary of the first column of circles is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the normal of the slab interface is along the @xmath12 direction . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations are performed using the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite with a boundary treatment of perfectly matched layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a point source of continuous wave is placed at the left side of the photonic crystal slab . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ image](a - b ) give the snapshots of the electric field for @xmath10 and @xmath13 , respectively . focused images are observed on the right side of the photonic crystal slab for both positions of surface termination . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations clearly demonstrate the negative refraction in such a photonic crystal slab . </S>",
    "<S> however , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ image](a ) , the image is relatively blurred , which indicates that the reflection at the slab interface is probably quite high . </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath13 ( corresponding to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ image](b ) ) has a better image than the case of @xmath10 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ image](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the surface termination influences quite much the reflection at the interface between air and the photonic crystal ( and consequently the image quality ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that it happens that the source and the image in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ image ] have a @xmath14-difference in phase for both positions of surface termination . in general , an arbitrary phase shift may be achieved by e.g. choosing an appropriate thickness of the photonic crystal slab @xcite .    since the photonic crystal slab is terminated with air at both sides , only one propagating mode exists at the right side of the photonic crystal slab for each incident plane wave component . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can apply the transfer function method to analyze the influence of the surface termination to the image quality ( see e.g. @xcite ) . utilizing the discrete fourier </S>",
    "<S> transform algorithm and the fdtd method , we can obtain the transfer function for such a photonic crystal slab . figure [ trans](a - d ) give the transfer functions of the imaging system with surface termination at @xmath10 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 , and @xmath16 , respectively . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ trans ] one sees that the transmission through the photonic crystal slab is strongly angular dependent , which is quite different from the case of a lhm ( @xmath7 ) slab in air . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the angular - dependent coupling coefficient at the interface between air and the photonic crystal . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ trans ] also shows that the transmission depends on the surface termination of the photonic crystal slab . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the results for other surface terminations , the transmission is relatively large when @xmath13 . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ trans](b ) one sees that the transfer function for @xmath17 is relatively flat at all propagating angles , which is essential for obtaining an image of good quality . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ trans ] one can also see that there exit some peaks in each transfer function . </S>",
    "<S> the peak positions vary for different surface terminations . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably due to the fabry - perot resonant effect since the effective width of the photonic crystal slab will decrease as the surface termination of the photonic crystal slab increases .    </S>",
    "<S> surface modes are generally supported by appropriate crystal termination surfaces . the surface mode ( solid line ) of the photonic crystal along @xmath8 direction with surface termination @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ surface ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the surface mode approaches a _ </S>",
    "<S> flat _ line near the working frequency , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in @xcite that the amplification of evanescent waves relies on resonant coupling mechanisms to surface photonic bound states . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ trans ] ( c ) , it is also confirmed that , for @xmath18 ( corresponding to the evanescent components of the source profile ) , the transmission of evanescent waves are much larger than those for other surface termination , with the help of the surface mode at the working frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to obtain high imaging quality .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the point imaging for a slab of photonic crystal with negative refraction . </S>",
    "<S> the influences of the surface termination to the transmission and the imaging quality have been analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the transfer function for the imaging system is obtained by combining the discrete fourier transform algorithm with the fdtd method . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation results have shown that the transmission is strongly angular dependent even when the effective refractive index of the photonic crystal is matched with the index of the air . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the surface termination plays a key role in obtaining an image of relatively good quality .    </S>",
