    "ice is a particularly rich example of crystallization , with a wide range of crystal shapes formed depending on the environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "it is also environmentally significant : it forms from the vapour phase in clouds , leading to snow and sleet , and from the liquid phase in rivers and oceans .",
    "we study so - called frazil - ice formation from the liquid phase in the environmentally relevant limit of weak supercooling , because this has received comparatively little attention @xcite .",
    "it also has key applications , both in industrial settings where frazil ice can block the water inlets from rivers and lakes @xcite , and in geophysical settings where frazil ice forms under floating ice shelves and in open areas of the polar oceans called leads and polynyas @xcite .",
    "frazil ice consists of individual crystals as a particulate suspension in a supercooled liquid from which the ice grows . this liquid could be freshwater , such as when frazil forms in rivers , or saltwater , such as when frazil forms in the ocean .",
    "we study crystal growth from a binary alloy as a simple proxy for saltwater .",
    "crystal growth from a binary alloy has been studied in a variety of geometries , most extensively for spherical and axially - symmetric cylindrical crystals , where morphological instability has been shown to be significant leading to dendritic growth @xcite .",
    "crystallization is often an inherently anisotropic process , and macroscopic anisotropy can arise from crystalline anisotropy .",
    "anisotropic surface energy is responsible for the so - called ` equilibrium wulff shape ' and anisotropic kinetic attachment is responsible for the ` kinetic wulff shape , ' as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "both these physical effects play an important role in the faceted growth of snow ice from the vapour phase , as shown by the numerical study of @xcite .",
    "however , a roughening transition can occur for solidification with sufficiently small supercooling , leading to the rapid growth of certain faces with finite curvature rather than planar faceted faces @xcite . for ice growth from vapour",
    ", the roughening transition occurs in prism faces for temperatures above @xmath0c @xcite , whilst for ice growth from the liquid phase , the roughening transition occurs above @xmath1c @xcite .",
    "basal facets have been observed to persist until the melting temperature in both cases @xcite .",
    "we here consider crystal growth in the liquid phase , at temperatures above the roughening transition for faces that grow in the basal plane .",
    "we focus on solidification controlled by the long range diffusive transport of heat and salt , and how this couples with anisotropic kinetic attachment in determining bulk crystal growth from the melt .",
    "frazil ice is observed to form axisymmetric disk - shaped crystals , at least for fairly weak supercooling @xcite .",
    "slow attachment kinetics limit growth perpendicular to the basal plane of the crystal while growth in the basal plane is limited by diffusion @xcite .",
    "previous studies make various approximations in order to determine the growth rate of a disk - shaped crystal in a pure melt .",
    "some proceed by the well known ` electrostatic analogy ' between ice growth limited by thermal diffusion and electrostatic capacitance @xcite .",
    "to give an example , @xcite uses this method to estimate the mass growth rate of a disk from the vapour phase . in this analogy , temperature is analogous to electrostatic potential , and the crystal growth rate is proportional to the capacitance of a perfect conductor , the surface of which will have a constant potential .",
    "thus , knowing the capacitance of a thin disk and assuming its thickness evolves slowly , the radial growth rate can be estimated .",
    "the analogy assumes that the disk is perfectly conducting ( which is a good approximation for ice growth from the vapour phase but not the liquid phase ) and infinitesimally thin .",
    "we will therefore assess whether the limits of perfectly conducting and infinitely thin can be taken independently .",
    "other studies note that growth controlled by the diffusive removal of latent heat depends on the ratio of the rate of latent heat release to the rate of thermal transfer away from the interface @xcite .",
    "these rates can in principle be estimated to within an undetermined dimensionless prefactor using scaling analysis .",
    "the success of a scaling approach relies on identifying the most appropriate physical scales .",
    "a more detailed study was made by @xcite , who make the mathematical simplification of assuming that the material properties of the phases are equal and that the growth was purely radial .",
    "the authors found a separable solution for the temperature field subject to diffusive heat transfer .",
    "this model has been used by @xcite to explain the experimental observations of @xcite of the growth and stability of ice crystals from a pure melt .",
    "the goal of this paper is to quantify the leading order factors controlling growth of disk - shaped crystals from a binary melt , accounting for the impacts of diffusive heat and salt transfer , and different material properties in a setting with dominant radial growth .",
    "we also make calculations with an approximate model of axial growth .",
    "none of these generalisations can be tackled using the methodology of @xcite . to isolate the separate physical effects",
    ", we build the complexity of our model in stages .",
    "we first consider the effect of the geometric shape of the crystals and the different material properties of the phases by considering the growth of disk - shaped crystals in a pure melt ( section [ sec : pure ] ) .",
    "we then consider the effect of axial growth ( section [ sec : axial ] ) and the effect of salt by considering a binary alloy ( section [ sec : binary ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the physical significance and implications of our results ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we first introduce the equations and boundary conditions used to determine the growth of an isolated crystal into a pure melt .",
    "consider an isolated axisymmetric disk - shaped crystal , as shown in figure [ fig : diagram ] , of radius @xmath2 and half - thickness @xmath3 , such that the aspect ratio @xmath4 , which we expect to be small . to aid progress with modelling",
    ", we make the simplifying assumption that crystal growth maintains the disk like geometry observed in experiments @xcite with uniform growth rates across each individual crystal face .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for radial growth of the thin disk edges provided that the disk remains morphologically stable ( discussed further in section [ sec : limitations ] ) .",
    "macroscopically uniform axial growth is consistent with an activated process , where growth is limited by the difficulty in nucleating a new layer of molecules somewhere on the face .",
    "this is followed by more rapid spreading of the layer following nucleation such that the interface remains macroscopically flat @xcite .",
    "alternatively , quasi - planar faces have been maintained in numerical models with anisotropic surface energy and anisotropic attachment kinetics @xcite , where the variation in interfacial temperature across the crystal face ( arising from the so - called berg effect @xcite ) can be offset by weak interfacial curvature .",

    "the normal growth is uniform across each crystal face because we assumed that the crystal remains disk - shaped . in the second equation for attachment kinetics ,",
    "the function @xmath30 depends on the normal direction to the interface @xmath31 and the difference between the equilibrium melting temperature and the interfacial temperature .",
    "the exact form used is not crucial in what follows in this section where we consider the limit of negligible axial growth , but does impact predictions of weak axial growth in section  [ sec : axial ] , where we discuss the physical significance of @xmath30 .",
    "we make a quasi - steady approximation in which we neglect the explicit time - dependence of the problem in the heat equations ( [ eq : heatd1 ] , [ eq : heatl1 ] ) , and justify this approximation a posteriori in section [ sec : qs ] .",
    "we neglect externally driven fluid flow and buoyancy - driven flow , and note that the expansion flow ( caused by the density of ice being lower than that of water ) can be neglected consistently with our quasi - steady approximation , so @xmath19 .",

    "growth is much slower in the direction perpendicular to the crystal basal plane because it is kinetically unfavourable .",
    "thus , in this section , we introduce a strong form of anisotropy into the model in a simple limiting form by taking @xmath36 at the top of the crystal @xmath37 and @xmath38 at the edge @xmath39 .",
    "this limit prevents axial growth and leaves the temperature @xmath27 at @xmath37 unconstrained , so it can depart from the melting temperature @xmath40 .",

    "the simplified boundary conditions are @xmath43 on the top the crystal @xmath44 , and @xmath45 on the edge @xmath46 .    in this quasi - steady limit , there are only three dimensionless parameters in the problem : the aspect ratio @xmath47 , the conductivity ratio @xmath48 and the stefan number @xmath49 thus the problem reduces to solving laplace s equation @xmath50 in the whole domain including the disk subject to the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bctop][eq : bct ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath51 is determined implicitly as part of the solution .",
    "in particular , we calculate a rescaled growth rate @xmath52 which is a function of the aspect ratio @xmath47 and conductivity ratio @xmath53 alone .",
    "given that @xmath54 in our non - dimensionalization , @xmath55 is proportional to the growth rate multiplied by the area of the growing surface .",
    "the boundary conditions contain a subtlety in that equations and are formally inconsistent .",
    "this is evident upon studying solutions to laplace s equation near the ` corner ' between the top and edge of the disk ( _ cf_. * ? ? ?",
    "the inconsistency arises from the simplifying assumption that the crystal remains perfectly disk shaped . in reality",
    ", we might expect the crystal shape to evolve via non - uniform growth rates and the regularising impact of surface energy described by the gibbs - thomson effect ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the freezing temperature modified by curvature generated near the ` corner ' over a length comparable to the capillary length scale .",
    "our primary interest is in leading order scalings for the macroscopic relief of supercooling and the volumetric rate of ice growth , rather than the detailed microstructure of the crystal edges which will depend on the poorly constrained orientation - dependence of the anisotropic surface energy and growth rate .",
    "hence we simplify the analysis and neglect these deviations from disk - shaped geometry .",
    "we follow @xcite , imposing on @xmath56 but only imposing at @xmath23 .",
    "we will see later that the dominant thermal gradients driving ice growth scale with the crystal radius @xmath2 rather than the disk half - thickness @xmath3 , and thus we expect the detailed geometry near the disk edges to have a relatively small influence on macroscopic ice growth rates for thin discs with @xmath57 .",
    "we have also tested the converse approach of applying equation on @xmath56 but only imposing in an integral sense .",
    "the difference is negligible for @xmath58 , suggesting that the detailed micro - evolution of crystal shape does not play a very significant role in radial disk growth from the liquid phase .",

    "the electrostatic analogy model of @xcite gives @xmath61 this is consistent with our function @xmath62 as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that the mason model has no dependence on aspect ratio .",
    "a commonly applied scaling argument of @xcite , gives @xmath65 which has a strong dependence on aspect ratio and predicts much smaller growth for thin disks than the mason model .",

    "this implies that the growth rate has only a weak , logarithmic dependence on aspect ratio .",

    "note that our benchmarked numerical results for @xmath59 agree with @xcite , and approach the scaling of @xcite at high @xmath53 and small @xmath47 .",
    "crucially , there is a significant difference compared to the scaling of @xcite .",
    "this difference is strongly linked to structure of the heat transport , a significant proportion of which occurs through the flat top and base of the disk .",

    "the red horizontal dashed line shows the @xcite model , the solid curve shows the @xcite model and the much lower dot - dashed curve shows the @xcite model.,width=325 ]      interestingly , even quite large changes in the thermal conductivity ratio have only a modest effect on the radial growth of crystals , with @xmath73 changing by less than factor of 2 as @xmath53 varies over 3 orders of magnitude ( figure [ fig : heat - comp ] ) .",
    "whilst a higher solid phase conductivity transports latent heat away from the interface more efficiently , the heat flux through the solid depends on the product @xmath74 , which is typically small , and the heat must in any case be transported away from the disk .",
    "the @xcite model corresponds to large @xmath74 , and so represents a limit which is inappropriate for frazil - ice growth in the ocean , but much more appropriate for ice formation in clouds ( its original purpose ) because ice is very much more thermally conductive than air .",
    "thus the physical processes controlling ice growth differ markedly between growth from the vapour and the liquid phase .",

    "however , while this standard requirement is appropriate for the growth of a spherical crystal , it must modified for the growth of a disk crystal . in particular , we may neglect the explicit time dependence in equation if @xmath80 . thus using equation we firstly require @xmath81 , given that @xmath82 throughout the parameter range of interest .",
    "this is another reminder of the differences that arise from the geometry of crystal growth .",
    "second , the dimensionless strength of the expansion flow ( induced by the density of ice being lower than that of water ) is negligible provided @xmath83 , because the induced flow is proportional to solidification rate and the density difference .",
    "third , we may neglect the time dependence in the heat equation for the solid phase provided @xmath84 . for ice ",
    "water disk crystals , these latter requirements are satisfied automatically provided @xmath81 .",
    "we investigate the potential effect of axial growth on the overall growth characteristics of the crystal by allowing a non - zero kinetic attachment coefficient for axial growth . in the previous section",
    ", we introduced an extreme , limiting form of anisotropy into the model by requiring that the disk remained at constant thickness through imposing a kinetic attachment coefficient @xmath36 on the top of the disk . in our non - dimensionalization of equations and  ,",
    "the dimensionless kinetic coefficient is @xmath85 which may become @xmath86 as the crystal radius increases .",
    "the precise form of @xmath30 in the axial direction is under constrained , but we here investigate several illustrative cases .",
    "a simple first approach is to assume that the attachment coefficient is linearly related to the supercooling at the interface @xcite , @xmath87 , and also that this temperature difference should be averaged over the face of the disk , consistent with assuming disk - shaped growth .",
    "a second alternative is to assume that growth is determined by the maximum , rather than the average , supercooling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest using a quadratic dependence on the maximum supercooling @xmath88 ( corresponding to a screw dislocation ) on the basis of experimental observations , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "an alternatively proposed @xcite dependence of @xmath30 on the tenth power of the supercooling ( corresponding to two dimensional nucleation ) results in extremely slow growth for the small supercooling that we consider , so the results should be well approximated by the limit of negligible axial growth considered in the previous section . these mechanisms of crystal growth allow the interface to remain macroscopically flat in spite of the variation in @xmath89 across the face . we define a rescaled axial growth rate @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the dimensionless axial growth rate .",
    "the function @xmath92 is proportional to the product of the growth rate and the growing surface area . in this section ,",
    "we illustrate results relevant to frazil - ice formation from liquid water , so fix @xmath71 .",
    "these three alternatives discussed above give growth rates , in dimensionless form , @xmath93 where @xmath94 for the linear laws ( [ eq : ax1][eq : ax2 ] ) and @xmath95 for the quadratic law .",
    "there are some differences between the resulting axial growth rates for each law as shown in figure [ fig : axial - laws ] . growth based on the maximum supercooling is necessarily faster than that based on the average , and does not vary smoothly with @xmath47 and @xmath96 , because the position of the maximum supercooling jumps . for small @xmath47 ,",
    "the maximum supercooling is always in the centre of the disk , but begins to move out as @xmath47 increases , before jumping to the edge of the disk when @xmath97 .",
    "the quadratic law is qualitatively similar to , but gives slower growth .",
    "axial growth is coupled nonlinearly to radial growth , through latent heat release associated with axial growth . despite some quantitative differences in axial growth illustrated in figure [ fig : axial - laws ] ,",
    "the differences between the 3 growth laws do not change the qualitative effect on radial growth .",
    "therefore , we focus on law as a representative example .",
    "the rescaled radial growth function @xmath98 depends on @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath99 as defined previously .     and ( _ b _ ) the rate of change in aspect ratio @xmath100 . in the latter , we highlight the critical curve @xmath101 on which the aspect ratio is constant ( @xmath102 . throughout we take @xmath71 . ,",
    "width=291 ]    firstly , axial growth inhibits radial growth .",
    "thus @xmath103 decreases as @xmath96 increases across the whole parameter space ( figure [ fig : axial_comb]_a _ ) .",
    "axial growth releases latent heat , which increases the temperature of the top of the disk and so reduces conduction through the disk interior away from the radially growing edge of the disk .",
    "this is especially significant because the disk is a good thermal conductor and a significant fraction of the removal of latent heat for solidification at the disk edges occurs via transport through the solid disk interior .",
    "secondly , the dimensionless axial growth increases with @xmath96 , and this effect is stronger at moderate aspect ratios ( _ cf_. figure [ fig : axial - laws]_a _ ) because the faces are further from the melting temperature .",
    "thirdly , we can compare axial and radial growth by considering the rate of change of aspect ratio .",
    "using our quasi - steady predictions of heat transfer to predict instantaneous growth rates @xmath51 and @xmath91 for given values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we derive a simple autonomous system for the dimensionless kinetic coefficient @xmath96 and the aspect ratio @xmath4 , @xmath104 where a dot represents a derivative with respect to the slow timescale @xmath105 . in figure",
    "[ fig : axial_comb](_b _ ) , we highlight the critical curve @xmath106 , which , for aspect ratios @xmath107 typical of frazil ice , corresponds in order of magnitude to @xmath108 . below the critical curve",
    "the aspect ratio decreases , and so the crystal becomes more elongated .",
    "conversely above the critical curve the aspect ratio increases .",
    "there is an important qualitative difference between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath109 , @xmath111 for all @xmath47 ( the thickness is fixed but the radius increases so the aspect ratio decreases ) . however , when @xmath110 , there is a critical aspect ratio below which @xmath112 .",
    "this can be used to interpret crystal size evolution .",
    "soon after a crystal nucleates , @xmath96 will be small but the aspect ratio will be @xmath86 . as the crystal radius increases",
    ", the aspect ratio decreases towards the critical curve , but @xmath96 will increase .",
    "thus , at sufficiently late time , the aspect ratio will eventually start to increase .",
    "some such trajectories are shown in figure [ fig : traj ] .",
    "it is important to note that the timescale used in the non - dimensionalization is proportional to @xmath113 and so the evolution of a crystal in phase space slows down as the crystal radius @xmath2 increases .",
    "the autonomous system of equations ( [ eq : autog][eq : autodoth ] ) significantly simplifies the parameter space .",
    "for example , we have scaled out the dependence on supercooling for the linear growth laws , which is hard to hold constant experimentally .",
    "thus this is a potentially powerful way to interpret experimental data by plotting time series of experimental observations in this parameter space .",
    "observing a minimum aspect ratio and the radius at this aspect ratio could be used to infer the dimensional kinetic coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "we show a phase portrait of this autonomous system in figure [ fig : traj ] .     and kinetic coefficient @xmath96 when @xmath71 .",
    "the thick dark red curves with arrows show trajectories and the dashed light grey curves are contours of @xmath100 .",
    "if the material properties of the crystal are held fixed , then variation in @xmath96 directly corresponds to variation in the dimensional crystal radius @xmath2 to within a constant proportionality factor.,width=302 ]    numerically , we observe that the critical curve , @xmath101 , on which @xmath106 , approaches zero as @xmath114 . in the particular case @xmath59 , we can average the solution ( equation 7a of @xcite ) over the surface of the disk , to show that @xmath115 convergence is exponentially slow as @xmath114 , but this nevertheless illustrates the important result that @xmath116 as @xmath64 , which affects the range of possible trajectories in phase space .",
    "the bulk diffusion of salt can play a leading order role in growth from the liquid phase through two related physical mechanisms .",
    "firstly , the presence of salt reduces the freezing temperature of the solution , resulting in a smaller imposed far - field supercooling for a given far - field temperature .",
    "secondly , the ice crystal rejects salt during growth , which can build up locally at the interface , so further inhibiting growth by depressing the interfacial temperature .",
    "we here focus on their impacts on disk shaped crystal growth , noting that in certain circumstances these effects may also promote morphological instability .",
    "we return to the latter possibility in the concluding discussion .",
    "we extend our method by additionally solving for the solute concentration field @xmath117 outside the disk , assuming that the concentration inside the disk @xmath118 is constant because diffusion of salt through the solid phase is slow relative to diffusion through the liquid phase .",
    "we outline the method more briefly .",
    "the main difference is that we require a condition relating the interfacial temperature @xmath27 to the concentration @xmath119 at the interface to couple the heat and salt problems .",
    "thus on the growing edge we impose @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the gradient of the ( assumed linear ) liquidus relationship @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the melting temperature of solid with concentration @xmath118 .",
    "we assume @xmath117 approaches a uniform concentration @xmath124 far from the crystal .",

    "we define @xmath130 which is the compositional analogue of the stefan number and again must be large for the quasi - steady approximation to hold ( section [ sec : qs ] ) .",
    "note that the thermal problem takes the same form as before , but with @xmath131 .",
    "thus we must additionally solve @xmath132 outside the disk subject to the following boundary conditions , which are analogous to equations ( [ eq : bctop][eq : bct ] ) , @xmath133 on the top of the disk @xmath44 where we set @xmath36 , and @xmath134 on the growing edge @xmath135 .",
    "as before , equation is only applied at @xmath23 . the lewis number , @xmath136 is the ratio of diffusivity of heat @xmath137 to solute @xmath138 in the liquid phase .",

    "when @xmath71 , the ratio @xmath144 shows only weak variation with @xmath47 , as shown in figure [ fig : salt - deph ] .",
    "thus @xmath145 could reasonably be treated as a material constant during disk growth , to leading order .",
    "we also define the dimensionless supercooling @xmath146 through @xmath147 where @xmath148 ensures supercooling in the far - field .",
    "indeed , there is supercooling everywhere in the liquid , and equilibrium is only achieved on the growing ice  liquid interface .",

    "growth is controlled by the diffusive removal of the latent heat released during solidification .",
    "however , for small @xmath145 ( equation [ eq : vratio - lima ] ) we find @xmath164 which means that growth is no longer controlled by the thermal diffusion of latent heat released at the interface but rather by the slow diffusion of solute rejected there .",
    "salt significantly affects frazil ice growth in the ocean . to see this",
    ", we estimate typical values @xmath165c , @xmath166c , and @xmath167 to 1 significant figure , using material properties estimated at @xmath168c , ocean water of salinity @xmath169 and pure ice with @xmath170 .",
    "thus @xmath171 which is is an intermediate case with @xmath172 , but rather closer to the limit dominated by solute rejection .",
    "thus both the dependence of freezing temperature on salinity and solute rejection are important , and significant errors result from neglecting either .",
    "there is large error in assuming that growth is controlled by the removal of released latent heat alone .    in larger scale models that parameterize frazil - ice growth",
    ", it is very common to adjust the freezing temperature with salinity , and some models also investigate the effect of salt rejection and diffusion .",
    "for example , @xcite multiply the growth rate by 0.2 as a way of testing for the sensitivity to salt .",
    "@xcite , extending @xcite , multiply their growth rate by a factor of @xmath173 which is typically about 0.2 .",
    "now at small supercooling , equation gives @xmath174^{-1},\\ ] ] which is a similar expression since the ratio @xmath175 is of order 1 .",
    "therefore , the approach of @xcite is likely to capture correctly the leading order behaviour for the salinity dependence of growth , although using equation with the numerical dependence on aspect ratio from equation could give slightly better results .",
    "an instructive way to express disk crystal growth when the crystal grows both radially and axially is in terms of growth rate of crystal mass .",
    "we write @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the mass of the crystal , @xmath178 is the total surface area , and the effective total growth rate factor @xmath179 , as shown in figure [ fig : contm ] .",
    "these results do not depend significantly on the choice of axial growth law .",
    "as a crude simplification , it is possible to take @xmath180 independent of @xmath47 and @xmath30 , so that the inclusion or exclusion of weak axial growth does not strongly impact the leading order scalings . if the aspect ratio is small , then @xmath181 , so a simple formula for frazil - ice growth in a pure melt is @xmath182 which can also be modified for salt as discussed previously . to within a factor of @xmath183 , equation yields the same growth rate as equation ( 2 ) of @xcite .     into a pure melt when @xmath71 , relevant to water - ice systems.,width=325 ]",
    "equation has a simple physical interpretation in terms of the scaling arguments introduced in section [ sec : disc - intro ] .",
    "firstly , heat transfer occurs across the whole surface area @xmath178 .",
    "for example , even when only the edges of the disk are growing , there is still a key contribution to the removal of latent heat from conduction through the solid from the growing edge and escaping through the crystal faces .",
    "indeed the transfer through the faces dominates when @xmath184 .",
    "secondly , the length scale of the thermal boundary layer scales with the radius of the crystal , not its thickness ( see figure [ fig : eg - heat ] ) , since @xmath185 is a heat flux .",
    "these conclusions hold independently of the details of the axial growth .    in our opinion ,",
    "the physical implications of the work of @xcite have not been fully appreciated , because these scales could have been inferred from their mathematical model .",
    "we have extended their work to investigate the effect of different thermal conductivity ratios , an approximate description of axial growth , and salt .",
    "many papers incorrectly estimate these scales controlling crystal growth . in some papers , for example @xcite , the area for heat transfer @xmath178 is taken to be the area of the edge of the crystal @xmath186 rather than the total surface area , whilst the thermal boundary layer is correctly assumed to have thickness proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting heat transfer thereby significantly underestimates crystal growth by a factor between 10 and 100 .",
    "alternatively , in other earlier papers , for example @xcite , the correct order of magnitude for the growth rate is obtained by erroneously using the area of the crystal edge @xmath186 combined with a thermal boundary layer thickness proportional to @xmath3 , two errors in the derivation that cancelled to produce the correct order of magnitude for the final result . moreover , in models that use a distribution of crystal sizes following @xcite , our results suggest that there has been an underestimation of evolution towards the larger crystal sizes , an area of research we are actively pursuing .",
    "we have identified order of magnitude errors in predictions of ice growth controlled primarily by thermal and solutal diffusion , or equivalently the timescale over which the initial supercooling of a melt is relieved .",
    "turbulent heat transfer will play a role when the crystal radius is larger than the kolmogorov length , because the thermal boundary layer scales like the crystal radius .",
    "while all of our analysis is confined to diffusive growth , much carries through relatively straightforwardly to the case of relatively weak turbulence by multiplying the diffusive growth rate by a modified heat transfer coefficient @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to characterize correctly the diffusive growth of crystals , and our calculations have rationalized this process and allowed us to test the assumptions inherent in models of frazil - ice dynamics .",
    "our calculated growth rates are likely to be important in more detailed models of frazil - ice population dynamics that account for evolution in crystal - size distribution @xcite .",
    "the assumption of small supercooling has entered this analysis at a number of stages .",
    "the quasi - steady approximation requires that the supercooling is small compared to @xmath187c for growth from pure water , and , for the case of ocean water of salinity @xmath169 , the supercooling must be small compared to @xmath188c .",
    "small supercooling inhibits morphological instability since experimental observations and stability analyses suggest that disk - shaped crystals are morphologically stable provided the thickness is less than about 100 times greater than the nucleation length @xcite , and this length is inversely proportional to the supercooling .",
    "the supercooling observed in lakes and oceans is typically rather small ( for example , the largest supercooling recorded by @xcite in an arctic polynya was ) , and so our assumption to neglect morphological instability appears to be appropriate for frazil ice . for stronger supercooling ,",
    "a range of crystal morphologies occur and a more complex study of heat transfer is required .",
    "the long range , diffusive transport of heat and salt plays an important role in the solidification of disk - shaped crystals from a binary melt .",
    "we have identified the physical scales that determine the bulk growth rate .",
    "we used a simple , thermodynamically motivated , anisotropic kinetic coefficient consistent with a disk - shaped morphology , and neglected anisotropic surface energy . in doing",
    "so we provided a complementary perspective on crystal growth to that of ` kinetic wulff shapes ' relevant to faceted snow ice growth , which allowed us to highlight the role of diffusion to the growth of disk - shaped frazil ice in oceans and rivers .",
    "we would like to thank jerome neufeld and john wettlaufer for valuable comments on earlier versions of this work .",
    "this publication arises from research funded by the john fell oxford university press ( oup ) research fund , and ajw also acknowledges financial support through the research program of the european union fp7 award pcig13-ga-2013 - 618610 sea - ice - cfd .",
    "we adopt a straightforward numerical method .",
    "we solve the axisymmetric form of laplace s equation in @xmath189 space using a finite - element - method with adaptive meshing , which concentrates the mesh near the disk corner , where most resolution is needed .",
    "we used the matlab partial differential equation toolbox .",
    "we use linear basis functions on triangular elements .",
    "we truncate our domain at spherical radius @xmath190 , following the method of @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath191 on this outer boundary gives an @xmath192 error .",
    "thus , motivated by the well - known multipole expansion for far - field behaviour of the solutions of laplace s equation , we instead set @xmath193 which has an @xmath194 error .    in order to implement the jump boundary condition equation",
    ", we introduce a notch of thickness @xmath195 at the growing edge of the disk , in which we impose a volumetric heat source .",
    "the notch becomes a line source in the limit @xmath196 .",
    "we investigated the dependence of @xmath73 and hence the growth rate on @xmath195 and @xmath197 .",
    "we ensure convergence to a relative error of less than 0.2% across the entire parameter space considered by using @xmath198 , @xmath199 .",
    "our results were benchmarked against the analytical solution of @xcite for the case @xmath59 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : heat - comp ] .    in terms of axial growth ( section [ sec : axial ] )",
    "the non - dimensional boundary conditions on the disk face are @xmath200_l^s , \\label{eq : stefanw } \\\\",
    "w&=\\mathcal{g } \\int_0 ^ 1 2 ( 1-\\theta_i ) r \\ , dr \\label{eq : kineticw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from equations and using the first axial growth law as an example .",
    "we solve equation in the same way as , by introducing a notch .",
    "the crucial difference to the purely radial growth case is that equation introduces a nonlinearity into the system of equations , which we solve iteratively , using a newton - raphson method .",
    "motivated by the asymptotic form of the toroidal integral ( equation [ eq : toroidal ] ) , we look for fits of the form @xmath201 , for @xmath202 constant , to the numerically calculated results presented in figures [ fig : heat - comp ] and [ fig : salt - deph ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath203 the absolute errors in these formulae are typically very small , and are entirely negligible compared to the modelling uncertainties . depending on the range of @xmath47 of interest , different formula can be obtained , but these are practical for @xmath204 .    for the ratio @xmath155 important to the combined heat and salt calculation , a very accurate formula is @xmath205 a simpler alternative with slightly diminished accuracy is to use a constant value as mentioned in the main text , for example 0.73 .",

    "<S> the physics of ice crystal growth from the liquid phase , especially in the presence of salt , has received much less attention than the growth of snow crystals from the vapour phase . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of so - called frazil ice by solidification of a supercooled aqueous salt solution is consistent with crystal growth in the basal plane being limited by the diffusive removal of the latent heat of solidification from the solid  liquid interface , while being limited by attachment kinetics in the perpendicular direction . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the formation of approximately disk - shaped crystals with a low aspect ratio of thickness compared to radius , because radial growth is much faster than axial growth . </S>",
