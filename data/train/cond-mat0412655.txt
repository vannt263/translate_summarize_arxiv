    "adsorption and desorption isotherms of a gas condensed into nano pores show hysteresis and have become very a useful tool for the classification of porous materials  @xcite . due to the effect of surface tension the formation of meniscii inside the pore",
    "is delayed on the desorption branch , resulting in a non - vanishing hysteresis area of the sorption isotherms .",
    "a theoretical analysis and detailed description of the early research on this phenomenon is described in a review by everett  @xcite .",
    "recent investigation from a point of view of the stability of adsorbed multilayers  @xcite and other  @xcite analytical and numerical approaches together with density functional theory also proposed that the hysteresis phenomenon is an intrinsic property of the phase transition in a single idealized pore and arises from the existence of metastable states .",
    "hysteresis in real materials is the collective phenomena involving interconnected network of simple pores  @xcite .",
    "however , quite recently it has been shown by numerical analysis  @xcite and experiments  @xcite that hysteresis can occur in isolated pores also .",
    "moreover the shape of the hysteresis loops are influenced by the characteristic features of the pore geometry . in this paper , using extensive monte carlo simulations , we intend to characterize the sorption isotherms for different pore geometries and compare our results directly to the experimental observations .    furthermore , we study the phase separation kinetics of a binary liquid in nano - pores at low temperatures .",
    "previous work  @xcite showed that a binary liquid , unlike ising - like complete phase separation , does not separate into two phases completely . instead the adsorbed material forms many small domains far below the coexistence region .",
    "an explanation for this behavior has been suggested on the basis of random - field ising model @xcite . on",
    "the contrary we found in case of a single - pore model with no randomness , confinement in a small pore slows down domain growth in certain regions of the wetting phase diagram  @xcite and as a result macroscopic phase separation is not observed on short time scales .",
    "moreover the late stage domain evolution , obtained from a two point correlation function @xmath1 follows the same lifshitz - slyozov  @xcite growth law of @xmath2 .",
    "unlike earlier research  @xcite of domain evolution in porous networks , we concentrate on a single pore which is more applicable for systems with low porosity(si mesopores  @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "randomness in terms of irregular pore structure or presence of impurity atoms in the pore wall , which is inherent in real systems , may have drastic effect on the domain growth .",
    "in this paper we focus on a single pore .",
    "an average over many isolated pores corresponding to an assembly of non - interconnected(unlike vycor ) pores can be experimentally developed  @xcite out of a b - doped si wafer via electrochemical etching .",
    "the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we overview , in section ii , the theoretical model and the monte carlo technique that we use in our simulation . in section iii",
    "a , we discuss the hysteresis phenomenon for different pore geometries in 2 and 3 dimensions and discuss how one can differentiate the pore structure from the hysteresis loops . in section iii  b , we focus on the evaporation of particles from the pore and discuss how the density in the pore reaches a new equilibrium value",
    ". sections iii  c , d are entirely devoted to the domain evolution in the pore environment where we propose a random - walk picture of the domain growth above a critical size comparable to the pore diameter .",
    "then we perform a quantitative study of growth phenomenon for a simple pore as well as for pores with defects .",
    "finally section iv finishes the paper with a discussion .",
    "a standard model for a binary liquid mixture , is the ising lattice - gas model with spin occupancy variables @xmath3 = 0 , 1 governed by the hamiltonian :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the particle - particle and wall - particle couplings respectively . we denote an occupied site as a particle and an empty site as a vacancy .",
    "experimental observations suggest that in case of a glass(si ) adsorbent , the pore wall has a very strong affinity towards the adsorbed gases , which implies @xmath7 .",
    "most of our simulations , unless otherwise specified , are performed at a fixed `` wettability '' @xmath8 .",
    "a change in this value does not qualitatively affect our results as long as @xmath9 .",
    "the geometry of the pores is chosen to be a rectangle of size @xmath10 in two dimension and parallelepiped of size @xmath11 in three dimension with @xmath12 .",
    "standard conserved order parameter dynamics(kawasaki ) is employed to study the diffusion and the domain growth kinetics in the nano pores .",
    "nearest neighbor spins @xmath3 and @xmath13 are exchanged with metropolis acceptance probability @xmath14 , \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represents the old and new spin configuration respectively . to improve the speed of simulations we always choose a particle with unit probability and define 1 mc step containing a number of trial - updates that is equal to the number of particles present in the system",
    "to study hysteresis in the adsorption / desorption process within a pore we attach one or two reservoirs depending upon the geometry of the pore . to avoid asymmetric diffusion into the pore , no periodic boundary condition is applied between the reservoirs . the particle density in the reservoirs",
    "is kept constant by adding(removing ) particle at a randomly chosen position in the reservoir as soon as a particle diffuses into the pore(reservoir ) . a snapshot of the hysteresis phenomenon for a simple pore geometry in @xmath17 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "initially , both the pore and the reservoirs are kept empty . the density of particles in the reservoirs(@xmath18 )",
    "are then slowly increased .",
    "particles are immediately adsorbed and form a single layer along the pore walls . at this stage",
    "the density in the pores(@xmath19 ) , rises sharply to a non - zero value which corresponds to the first jump of adsorption isotherms(fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath19 forms a long plateau until two semicircular(or hemispherical in @xmath20 ) meniscii(a meniscus for one - end open pore ) are formed somewhere in the middle of the pore at a high reservoir density and move apart from each other to fill the entire pore ; a second jump in @xmath19 is observed .",
    "we call this complete pore filling and further increase in @xmath18 does not change @xmath19 .",
    "and @xmath21 at temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the shaded regions and the black spots on both sides of the pore are respectively the attached reservoirs and the particles in it . for each value of @xmath18",
    "the system is equilibrated up to @xmath23 .",
    "snapshots * ( a ) * correspond to the adsorption and * ( b ) * correspond to the desorption isotherms . ]    next , we slowly decrease the reservoir density and record the corresponding filling fraction @xmath19 after the system is equilibrated . on desorption , however at a much smaller reservoir density @xmath18 , we see the semicircular meniscii to form on the open ends of the pore , followed by a sharp fall in the pore density @xmath19 , as the meniscii approaches towards each other .",
    "finally the desorption curve follows the same path as that of the adsorption .",
    "since the diffusion occurs very slowly into the pores , a long waiting time @xmath24 is needed to equilibrate the whole system for each value of @xmath18 .     of the pore as a function of the reservoir density @xmath18 in 2 dimension .",
    "the equilibration time @xmath24 for each data point @xmath25 .",

    "equilibration time @xmath26 , pore length @xmath27 and reservoir length is 10 . for each hysteresis isotherm data",
    "are averaged over 50 disorder samples . ]",
    "our simulation results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where column * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * shows the hysteresis in 2 and 3 dimensions respectively .",
    "the simulations are performed with systems of length @xmath28 100 and 50 at temperatures @xmath29 = 0.3 , 0.6 in @xmath17 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "reservoir lengths are kept fixed at @xmath30 .",
    "ink - bottle pores are equally divided into two parts ; one with the narrow tube of diameter @xmath31 and the other is relatively wider sack with diameter @xmath32 . to make sure that pore density @xmath19 does not change any more , each data point of the sorption - isotherms",
    "is equilibrated for @xmath33 time steps .",
    "finally for each hysteresis loop data are averaged over 50 ensembles .",
    "it is evident from the sorption branches of ii - iiia , b , that they are much steeper than in ia , b .",
    "this is due the formation of two meniscii on both sides of the pore , which accelerate the filling and emptying procedure .",
    "such characteristic feature distinguishes between a one - end open and both - end open pore .",
    "further , an increase in pore diameter requires a higher reservoir density to initiate the formation of meniscii , which effectively delays the onset of adsorption saturation . as a result the the loop area for bigger pore is also increased as shown in iia , b and iiia , b .",
    "this features can be used to compare pores of different sizes .    in experiments  @xcite",
    "one observes a two step decrease of the desorption isotherms corresponding to ink - bottle pores . our data , as shown in figure vb , for a both - end open pore in @xmath20 of similar geometry , agrees quite well with the experimental predictions .",
    "the two step decrease of the desorption isotherm arises from the sequential emptying of the different sections(of diameter @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) of the pore .",
    "the heights of the two steps suggest the wider section of the pore emptied earlier than the smaller section",
    ". however , ink - bottle pores in figure iva , b(@xmath17-both end open ) and va(@xmath20-one end open ) do not exhibit such special characteristics .",
    "absence of this feature may be due to a small temperature or a small system size with insufficient @xmath34 ratio .      if a partially or completely filled pore is kept in vacuum , the density inside it decreases with time .",
    "this is what we call evaporation and investigate it for different pore geometries . in experiments",
    "@xcite one measures the vapor pressure change inside a previously equilibrated pore subject to the pressure variation in the reservoir",
    ". however , we carry out the simulation in a slightly different way by keeping the initial pore density just above the desorption threshold .    to study the variation in pore density @xmath19 as a function of time we fill pores completely and allow it to evaporate in an empty reservoir(vacuum ) .",
    "the change in @xmath19 has been recorded as a function of time @xmath35 .",
    "decay of the pore density can be very well described by a stretched exponential law ,    @xmath36 . \\label{eq3}\\ ] ]    the simulation is carried out in pores with both simple and ink - bottle geometry . for simple",
    "pore we study the evaporation at temperature @xmath370.4 , for systems with @xmath38 128 , 256 , 400 , 512 and @xmath397 and finally average over 50 ensembles . the pore density @xmath19 as a function of time @xmath35 is plotted in fig .  [ fig3]*(a ) * in a log - linear scale .",
    "it is noticed that a pure stretched exponential decay is found only above a certain value of the pore filling fraction as shown by continuous lines .",
    "these values of @xmath19 are nothing but the ratio between the number of surface to bulk molecules and decreases as @xmath40 becomes larger .",
    "the surface molecules , are attached rather strongly ( @xmath41 ) to the walls and slow down the evaporation rate for a while but finally drop off suddenly to zero .",
    "as the length of the system is increased , the particles deep inside the pore requires much more trial attempts to diffuse till the open end which effectively increases the evaporation time for longer pores .",
    "this leads to the decay exponent @xmath42 to decrease with @xmath40 , as shown in the _ inset _ of * ( a)*.    a similar study in case of ink - bottle pores was carried out with systems of fixed @xmath43 and @xmath44 for different values of @xmath45 7 , 21 , 35 , 49 as shown in fig .",
