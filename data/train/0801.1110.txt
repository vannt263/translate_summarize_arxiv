    "* ) essentially all rely on photometric redshifts .",
    "ideally , all these studies would have been based on spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "however , obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the required samples is hampered by several obstacles .",
    "due to their faintness , obtaining redshifts of high - redshift galaxies requires long integrations on 8 - 10 m class telescopes .",
    "the largest samples of spectroscopically confirmed high redshift galaxies number in the 1000s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several orders of magnitude short of the largest photometric samples .",
    "furthermore , and more fundamentally , current spectroscopic samples are strongly biased towards blue , star forming galaxies which are bright in the observer s optical ( lyman break galaxies , or lbgs ) .",
    "however , it has become clear that the typical massive galaxy at this redshift range is red in the rest - frame optical and faint in the rest - frame ultra - violet ( uv ) , and blue lbgs constitute only @xmath720% of massive galaxies at @xmath6 @xcite .    obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for typical massive galaxies requires deep spectroscopy at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately , nir observations are complicated by the combination of the high sky brightness , numerous bright and variable night sky lines and strong atmospheric absorption bands , and the limited field of view of current and planned nir spectrographs .",
    "thus , obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for hundreds or thousands of galaxies with @xmath8 ( the typical brightness of galaxies with @xmath9 at @xmath10 ) will not be feasible in the foreseeable future . until the next generation of space missions and @xmath11 m ground - based telescopes we remain largely dependent on photometric redshifts for studies of large and faint galaxy samples beyond @xmath12 .",
    "our provisional dependency on broadband photometric studies requires a more accurate calibration and understanding of the involved systematics .",
    "the current spectroscopic samples used for calibration of photometric high - redshift studies are based primarily on optical spectroscopy .",
    "as these samples are biased towards un - obscured star - forming galaxies , their calibration may not be representative for the total sample of massive galaxies .",
    "photometric properties of red , massive galaxies at high redshift are poorly calibrated , and since red galaxies dominate the high mass end at @xmath5 , systematics may have large effects on the final results .",
    "nir spectroscopy on a substantial , unbiased sample of massive , high - redshift galaxies is needed to test our photometric studies , and obtain insights regarding possible systematic effects .",
    "the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is especially well - suited for spectroscopy of @xmath1 galaxies , due to the large wavelength coverage offered by the cross - disperser ( 0.9 - 2.5 @xmath13 m ) .",
    "this coverage offers two advantages : there is a large probability of finding emission lines , and it allows the characterization of the continuum emission , which is particularly important for galaxies without detected lines . in @xcite",
    "we found that a substantial fraction of the massive galaxies at @xmath1 have no detected emission lines .",
    "for these galaxies we derived spectroscopic redshifts by modeling the stellar continuum , driven by the balmer/4000   break @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present our full survey of @xmath0-selected galaxies at @xmath1 , conducted with gnirs on gemini - south between september 2004 and march 2007 . in total",
    "we integrated more than @xmath780 hours , divided over 6 observing runs , on a sample of 36 galaxies . in previous papers based on preliminary results of this survey we discussed the stellar populations @xcite and the origin of the line emission @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will give an overview of the total survey (   [ dat ] ) , compare photometric and spectroscopic redshifts (   [ red ] ) and stellar populations properties (   [ imp ] ) , and discuss the implications for photometric studies (   [ imp ] ) .    throughout the paper we assume a @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17  km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "the broadband magnitudes are given in the vega - based photometric system unless stated otherwise .",
    "furthermore , we will measure the scatter and the offset between various properties using the normalized biweight mean absolute deviation and the biweight mean , respectively @xcite .",
    "as biweight statistics are less sensitive towards outliers than the normal mean , and more efficient than the median , they are most appropriate for the small sample sizes in this work .",

    "this redshift interval is chosen as the bright emission lines h@xmath24 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath25 , and [ nii ] fall in the @xmath26 and @xmath0 atmospheric windows .",
    "a few galaxies had @xmath27 at the time of selection , but were observed because a large part of their confidence intervals fell in the targeted redshift range , or because the galaxy had a known @xmath28  between 2.0 and 2.7 ( cdfs-6202 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to catalog updates of the ecdfs field , the final @xmath29  of several more galaxies scattered out of the selected redshift range .",
    "the fact that the ecdfs catalog was still in a preliminary stage at the time of selection may complicate some of the interpretation in this work .",
    "for this reason and the fact that the ecdfs is the only field with shallow nir photometry , the analysis in this paper will also focus on the subsample excluding the ecdfs .",
    "in total we obtained usable nir spectra for a sample of 36 galaxies . for @xmath74 additional galaxies we obtained empty spectra due to mis - alignment or extremely bad weather conditions .",
    "it is important to establish whether our sample is representative for the galaxy population at @xmath10 . in figure  [ mass_vs_k_sel ]",
    "we compare the distributions of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , rest - frame @xmath32 color and @xmath29  of our spectroscopic sample with a photometric mass - limited sample ( @xmath33 ) at @xmath5 .",
    "for the latter we use the deep musyc fields , as the wide nir data are too shallow to extract a mass - limited sample @xcite .",
    "according to a mann - whitney and a kolmorov - smirnov test , the photometric properties @xmath30 , @xmath31 , rest - frame @xmath32 color ( as derived from the photometry ) and @xmath29  of the gnirs sample are representative for a photometric mass - limited sample at @xmath5 ( see probabilities in panels of fig .",
    "[ mass_vs_k_sel ] ) .",
    "the mann - whitney test assesses whether the two sample populations are consistent with the same mean of distribution , while the k - s test examines whether the two samples could have been drawn from the same parent distribution . for both tests",
    "the probability should be greater than the 0.05 significance level .",
    "the galaxies targeted with gnirs are all bright in @xmath0 ( @xmath34 ) . in order to examine if bright galaxies are a biased sub - sample of the total mass - limited sample , we split the sample in bright and faint members .",
    "figure  [ mass_vs_k_sel ] shows that the bright and faint members have the same distribution of rest - frame @xmath32 and observed @xmath31 colors .",
    "the main difference between the bright and faint members is the redshift distribution : almost all @xmath0-bright galaxies have @xmath29@xmath35 .",
    "this also causes their bluer @xmath30 colors : in contrast to the @xmath36-band , the @xmath37-band does not fall entirely bluewards of the optical break for @xmath38 .",
    "the redshift dependence of @xmath30 is clearly visible in figure  [ rep ] . however , except for the difference in redshift and presumably stellar mass , we see no hints that the bright and faint members of a mass - limited sample at @xmath5 have different stellar populations . thus , although the spectroscopic sample may have similar stellar population properties as @xmath0-bright galaxies , it is less representative for a @xmath0-bright sample at @xmath5 , as the median redshift and its corresponding distribution is substantially different .",
    "we observed the full sample of 36 galaxies with gnirs in cross - dispersed mode , in combination with the 32 lines  mm@xmath18 grating and the 0675 slit .",
    "this configuration resulted in a spectral resolution of @xmath39 .",
    "the galaxies were observed during six observing runs in 2004 september ( program gs-2004b - q-38 ) , 2005 may ( program gs-2005a - q-20 ) , 2006 january ( program gs-2005b - c-12 ) and 2006 february ( program gs-2006a - c-6 ) , 2006 december ( program gs-2006b - c-5 ) and 2007 march ( program gs-2007a - c-9 ) . during the first two runs most time",
    "was lost due to bad weather , and only a handful of galaxies was observed under mediocre weather condition ( seeing @xmath40 ) .",
    "the weather was excellent throughout the full 3rd and 4th run , and we reached a median seeing of @xmath705 .",
    "the conditions were slightly worse during the last two runs , with a median seeing of @xmath707 , and some time was lost due to clouds .",
    "we observed the galaxies following an abab  on - source dither pattern , such that we can use the average of the previous and following exposures as sky frame .",
    "this cancels sky variation and reduces the noise in the final frame .",
    "all targets were acquired by blind offsets from nearby stars .",
    "the individual exposures are 5 minutes for the galaxies observed during the first two runs , and 10 minutes for the remaining runs .",
    "the total integration times for all galaxies are listed in table  [ sample ] . before and after every observing sequence we observe an a  v0 star , for the purpose of correcting for telluric absorption .",
    "the final spectra of the two stars were combined to match the target s airmass .",
    "a detailed description of the reduction procedure of the gnirs cross - dispersed spectra is given in @xcite .",
    "in summary , we subtract the sky , mask cosmic rays and bad pixels , straighten the spectra , combine the individual exposures , stitch the orders and finally correct for the response function .",
    "1d spectra are extracted by summing all adjacent lines ( along the spatial direction ) with a mean flux greater than 0.25 times the flux in the central row , using optimal weighting .",
    "we also constructed `` low resolution '' binned spectra from the 2d spectra for each galaxy following the method as described in @xcite .",
    "each bin contains 80 `` good '' pixels ( i.e. , wavelength regions with high atmospheric transmission and low sky emission ) , corresponding to 400   per bin .",
    "sky , transmission , and noise spectra were constructed for each galaxy as well .",
    "we assess the uncertainties on the low resolution spectra by splitting the data in two sequences for several objects and comparing the results .",
    "we find that the errors as derived from the photon noise underestimate the true uncertainty for most galaxies . in figure",
    "[ error ] we show two examples . in order to obtain a better consistency between the observing sequences , we increase the uncertainties for all bins by quadratically adding 10% of the average flux in the spectrum .",
    "we use the broadband nir photometry to perform the absolute flux calibration . for each galaxy",
    "we integrate the spectrum over the same @xmath37 , @xmath26 and @xmath0 filter curves as the photometry .",
    "we determine one scaling factor per galaxy , from the difference between the spectroscopic and photometric nir magnitudes , and use this factor to scale the nir spectrum .",
    "we note that at this stage both the spectra and the photometry may contain flux contributions by emission lines .",
    "we extend our wavelength coverage by attaching the optical photometry to the scaled spectra . for the emission - line galaxies we subsequently remove the line fluxes from the affected bins , using the best - fit to the emission lines as derived in @xcite .    as a quality check",
    "we compare the photometric nir colors @xmath41 , @xmath30 and @xmath42 to those derived from the spectra . the direct comparison for the individual galaxies is presented in figure  [ q_check ] .",
    "as expected , the scatter is larger for the galaxies with shallow nir photometry .",
    "the fraction of galaxies for which the spectroscopic and photometric colors are consistent within 1@xmath21 are listed in the panels .",
    "for all colors these fractions are slightly lower than expected , suggesting that the uncertainties may be slightly underestimated",
    ". this may be partly due to color gradients in the galaxies , as we use different apertures to determine the colors .",
    "the spectroscopic apertures are rectangular , and depend on the extraction radius and method , which differs per galaxy . on average",
    "the spectroscopic apertures are 0675 by 12 , slightly smaller than the circular photometric apertures which have a diameter of @xmath714 .    the final low resolution spectra and broadband photometry for the full sample are presented in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "the galaxies are ordered by total @xmath0 magnitude ( see table  [ sample ] ) , starting with the brightest galaxy .",
    "remarkably , there is not a strong trend between quality of the spectrum and the total @xmath0-band magnitude for the same integration time .",
    "we suspect that the surface brightness of the object plays an important role , as bright objects with low quality spectra and typical integration times , such as ecdfs-4511 and ecdfs-9822 , are extended even in the musyc imaging , which have a image quality of @xmath43 .",
    "for 19 of the galaxies in the sample we detected one or more emission lines , and thus for these galaxies we could determine exact spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the remaining galaxies may have no or very faint emission lines , or the lines are expected in atmospheric wavelength regions with low transmission or strong sky emission .",
    "fortunately , we can derive fairly precise redshifts from the continuum emission alone , mainly due to the presence of the balmer/4000   break in the nir spectra @xcite .",
    "for none of the galaxies absorption lines are detected .",
    "we fit the low resolution binned spectra together with the optical photometry by @xcite stellar population models .",
    "we allow a grid of 24 different ages ( not allowing the galaxy to be older than the age of the universe ) , and 31 different exponentially declining star formation histories ( sfhs ) with the characteristic timescale ( @xmath44 ) varying between 10  myr and 10  gyr .",
    "we leave redshift as a free parameter for the galaxies without emission lines .",
    "furthermore , we adopt the @xcite reddening law and allow 41 values for @xmath4 between 0 en 4 mag .",
    "we compute the @xmath45 surface as function of all stellar population parameters .",
    "for all grid points we assume the @xcite imf , and solar metallicity . a @xcite or a @xcite imf yield stellar masses and sfrs which are a factor of @xmath46 lower .",
    "the mass differences when using the stellar population library by @xcite are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we derive 1@xmath21 confidence intervals on the redshifts and stellar population properties using 200 monte carlo simulations .",
    "we vary all bins of the low - resolution spectra according to their uncertainties , and fit the simulated spectra using the same procedure as described above .",
    "next , we determine the contour in the original @xmath45 surface that encompasses 68% of the monte carlo simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 1@xmath21 confidence intervals for all properties are the minimum and maximum values that are allowed within this @xmath45 contour .    for the emission - line galaxies , we removed the emission line fluxes from the spectra before fitting .",
    "this is different to our previous method presented in @xcite in which we mask the bins that are contaminated by emission lines .",
    "the difference in modeling results ( although consistent within the errors ) compared to @xcite are due to this improvement and updates of the broadband photometry catalogs .",
    "all spectroscopic redshifts and corresponding stellar population properties are listed in table  [ tab_spec ] .    in order to test the accuracy of the continuum redshifts , we also fit the emission - line galaxies with redshift as a free parameter . in figure  [ ztest ]",
    "we compare the emission line redshifts with the continuum redshifts .",
    "we find a scatter of @xmath47@xmath48 and no significant systematic offset . in figure  [ ztest2 ]",
    "we examine causes of the errors .",
    "first , as the modeling is driven by the optical break , we expect this method to be less accurate if the break falls between atmospheric windows . in the figure",
    "[ ztest2]a we indeed find that galaxies for which the break falls outside the spectrum or in between the @xmath37 and @xmath26 band have less accurate @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , we expect the continuum redshifts to be more accurate for galaxies with strong optical breaks . in the figures  [ ztest2]b and c we show the correlation with rest - frame @xmath32 color and observed @xmath31 color .",
    "if we exclude the galaxies for which the break falls between atmospheric windows ( _ gray symbols _ ) , we indeed find that blue galaxies with weak optical breaks , have less accurate continuum redshifts .",
    "the continuum redshifts for galaxies without emission lines might even be more accurate , as these galaxies generally have larger breaks @xcite .",
    "finally , in figure  [ ztest2]d we examine the correlation between @xmath50 and the s / n per bin .",
    "remarkably , we do not find an obvious trend .",
    "however , the different causes for errors and the small size of the sample may have affected a possible correlation .",
    "photometric redshifts are derived using the method described by @xcite .",
    "the code fits a linear non - negative superposition of the 8 templates presented in the left panel of figure  [ templates ] to the broadband photometry using @xmath45 minimization .",
    "this template set consist of the empirical e , sbc , scd and i m templates from @xcite , the two least reddened starburst templates from @xcite , and a 1 gyr and 10 myr @xcite single stellar population with a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "confidence intervals on @xmath29  are determined using 100 monte - carlo simulations , in which the broadband photometry is varied according to the photometric uncertainties .",
    "we determine photometric stellar populations properties by fitting @xcite stellar population models to the broadband seds , with the redshift fixed to the best - fit @xmath29 .",

    "[ rep ] ) , the trend between @xmath47  and @xmath28(which is a logical result of our @xmath29  selection ) complicates the interpretation of this test . in the next section",
    "we will use rest - frame colors in order to avoid this effect .      in this section",
    "we will examine the different causes for systematics and catastrophic failures in @xmath47  as identified in the previous subsection .",
    "we define failures as galaxies for which @xmath47@xmath59 . in figure  [ phot ]",
    "we show the broadband photometry and best - fit stellar population models , in- or excluding the spectral information , for all failures .",
    "however , for several galaxies the photometric redshift is poorly constrained  for example due to degeneracies  and despite the large discrepancy , @xmath28  agrees reasonably well with the confidence interval of @xmath29 .",
    "thus we discriminate between failures for which @xmath28  is or is not consistent within 3  @xmath21 with @xmath29 , and define these as `` good failures '' and `` bad failures '' respectively .",

    "for one galaxy with @xmath47@xmath60 ( 1256 - 519 ) , @xmath29  and @xmath28are not consistent within 3  @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ sys]b shows that all bad failures have shallow nir photometry , with an average s / n in @xmath26 and @xmath0 of @xmath61 .",
    "this illustrates that deep nir photometry is needed to get meaningful photometric redshifts and corresponding confidence intervals .",
    "not all galaxies with shallow nir photometry are bad failures , or even failures at all , but the probability that a galaxy with shallow nir data has a @xmath29  which is inconsistent with the spectroscopic redshift is substantially larger than for galaxies with deep nir data .    as good failures have similar @xmath47  as bad failures , their confidence intervals are by definition larger .",
    "large confidence intervals may be caused by shallow nir data or model degeneracies .",
    "several good failures indeed have shallow nir photometry , and their photometric redshifts are  possibly by coincidence ",
    "consistent with their spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the deviating photometric redshifts of high s / n failures must have a different origin . in the following we examine several potential causes for good failures :    _ deviating nir colors : _ in figure  [ sys]c we relate @xmath62  with the difference between the photometric and spectroscopic @xmath41 color ( see  [ nir_spectra ] ) . as the optical break falls between the @xmath37- and @xmath26-band for @xmath6 galaxies , a deviating @xmath41 color may affect the optical break identification , and thus may place a galaxy at the wrong redshift .",
    "this may have happened for 1030 - 609 and 1030 - 2927 ( see fig .  [ spec ] ) .",
    "we note that a few galaxies are missing from figure  [ sys]c as their spectroscopic nir colors could not be determined ( see fig .",
    "[ q_check ] ) .",
    "_ emission - line contamination : _ contamination by emission lines generally reddens the rest - frame optical colors , which may result in a wrong break identification .",
    "figure  [ sys]d shows that for several galaxies the photometric nir colors appear redder due to the flux contribution by emission lines .",

    "[ spec ] ) with deep nir photometry , for which the emission line contamination may be the main cause for a wrong @xmath29 .    _",
    "k band magnitude : _ due to the shape of the luminosity function , the fraction of low to high redshift galaxies is much larger at brighter @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "thus , it is expected that the interloper fraction is larger at the bright end . in figure",
    "[ sys]e we indeed see that the fraction of good failures compared to the total sample increases at brighter @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "this effect can be reduced by using a luminosity prior in the @xmath29  fitting code , to break the degeneracy in favor of the correct low - redshift solution .    _ correlations with sed types : _ in figures  [ sys]f , g and h we examine correlations with sed type by comparing @xmath62  with rest - frame @xmath32 color , best - fit age and dust content ( all derived from the spectroscopic information ) .",

    "we find no obvious correlation between @xmath62  and rest - frame @xmath32 color .",
    "nonetheless , figures  [ sys]g and h suggest a relation with stellar population properties , such that young and/or dusty galaxies have a higher probability of having a wrong @xmath29 .",

    "this may suggest that appropriate templates ( i.e. , dusty ones ) are missing in our @xmath29  procedure .",
    "we will examine this in more detail in ",

    "we will examine the influence of the different causes , by attempting to correct for them .      in order to test the different causes found for the systematics and failures in @xmath47 ,",
    "we refit the photometry attempting to correct for these effects .",
    "first we construct a new template set from our gnirs sample . by eye",
    "we pick six best - fit seds from figure  [ spec ] , to be representative for the @xmath10 massive galaxy population .",
    "these new templates are presented in the right panel of figure  [ templates ] .",
    "we refit the broadband photometry of all galaxies only allowing these 6 templates , without superposition and luminosity prior , in steps ( @xmath64 ) of 0.02 .    in figures  [ newz]a and b",
    "we show the comparison between the old and new @xmath29 , respectively , versus @xmath28 .",
    "the galaxies with high s / n nir photometry are presented by filled symbols .",
    "the new templates reduce both the systematics and scatter .",
    "remarkably , the improvement is largest for galaxies with low s / n photometry .",
    "although , the newly defined template set yields more accurate photometric redshifts than the original template set , it provides no general solution .",
    "it is constructed to work especially for massive galaxies at @xmath5 , and thus they may not be appropriate when applied to lower redshift or less massive galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , this test illustrates the importance of using well - calibrated templates .",
    "similar template mismatches may also apply to other galaxy populations , and further exploration is needed in order to better calibrate high - redshift studies .    in order to test whether errors in the nir broadband photometry",
    "may be responsible for systematics or may lead to an increase in the scatter , we attempt to correct the photometry using the nir spectra . in figure",
    "[ newz]c we replace the @xmath37 , @xmath26 and @xmath0 by the spectroscopic colors and repeat the original fitting procedure , using the original templates .",
    "the spectroscopic colors do not lead to an improvement , and in fact even lead to more pronounced scatter and systematics , in particular for the galaxies with deep nir photometry .",
    "this might not be surprising , as for these galaxies the s / n of the @xmath41 photometric colors is generally higher than the s / n of the spectroscopic colors .",
    "furthermore , we remove the emission line fluxes from the broadband photometry before repeating the original fitting procedure .",
    "figure  [ newz]d shows that this does not reduce the scatter or the systematics .",
    "this may be because several of the original templates contained emission lines .",
    "also , the massive galaxies studied in this work all have comparatively weak emission lines , and contamination may play a much larger role for less massive galaxies .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts and higher resolution spectral shapes as obtained by the nir spectra provide better constraints on the stellar population properties .",
    "this allows us to test the significance and reliability of the photometrically derived properties , and examine the completeness and systematics of photometric samples . in   [ sect_prop ] we quantify the improved constraints on the stellar population properties , and identify the driving force behind this improvement . in   [ phot_samples ]",
    "we test photometric samples , and finally in   [ prev_studies ]",
    "we assess previous studies based on photometric samples .      in this section",
    "we compare the photometric and spectroscopic stellar population properties , as listed in tables  [ tab_spec ] and [ tab_phot ] .",
    "note that the photometric properties are derived using the original photometric redshifts (   [ zphot ] ) .",
    "figure  [ prop ] illustrates the effect on the properties age , @xmath4 , @xmath44 , stellar mass and sfr when including the spectroscopic information . in the left panels we show the comparison for individual galaxies .",
    "the panels in the second column present the distributions of the photometric and spectroscopic properties . in the third column",
    "we show the distribution of the difference between photometric and spectroscopic properties .",
    "finally , in the panels in the fourth column we show the ratio of the photometric and spectroscopic 1@xmath21 confidence intervals .",
    "the differences between the best - fit photometric and spectroscopic properties in the left diagrams of figure  [ prop ] are striking .",
    "@xmath4 has a scatter of @xmath71 mag , and age , @xmath44 and sfr each have a scatter of a factor of @xmath73 - 4 , between the photometric and spectroscopic values . despite the large scatter , for a high fraction ( 75 - 89% ) of the galaxies the photometric properties are consistent with the spectroscopic properties within 1@xmath21",
    "this demonstrates the reliability of the large confidence intervals in table  [ tab_phot ] , and supports that the best - fit photometric properties age , @xmath4 , @xmath44 and sfr are poorly determined for individual galaxies .",
    "the spectroscopic properties are better constrained , but the errors are still substantial , with a factor of @xmath72 for age , tau , and sfr and @xmath70.4 mag for @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the stellar population properties show a large scatter , even when the photometric redshift is close to the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "although the photometrically and spectroscopically derived best - fit values are consistent , the photometric and spectroscopic distributions show systematic differences ( fig .  [ prop ] , 2nd column ) . in   [ sect_sys ] we identified possible correlations between @xmath47and stellar population properties .",
    "due to the lack of appropriate templates , the stellar population properties seem to `` converge '' to the properties of the template that provides the best fit during the @xmath29  procedure . as many galaxies are best - fit by the dust - free 1 gyr template , we see a peak at @xmath65 and an age of 1 gyr for the photometry .",
    "the @xmath65 peak completely disappears , and the age peak shifts to lower ages when including spectroscopic information .",
    "this suggest that the distribution of best - fit photometric stellar population properties , as presented in the 2nd column of figure  [ prop ] may be strongly biased .    while it is clear that spectroscopic data significantly improve the constraints on the stellar population properties , it is interesting to know whether the improvements are primarily due to the precise redshift determination or whether they are also caused by the spectroscopic measurement of the continuum shape .",
    "we test the impact of both effects by modeling the broadband photometry by stellar population models ( see procedure   [ zspec ] ) , fixing the redshift to @xmath28 . in figure",
    "[ what ] we disentangle the two effects , by comparing on the horizontal axis the improvement of the stellar population properties due to the higher resolution spectral shape ( i.e. , new modeling results versus spectroscopic properties ) and on the vertical axis the effects of the better constrained redshift ( i.e. , photometric properties versus new modeling results ) . the corresponding scatter and systematics are listed in table  [ tab_scatter ] . remarkably , the results for age and @xmath44 are more affected by the higher resolution spectral shape , rather than by the better constrained redshift . for sfr and @xmath4 both effects are equally important .",
    "photometric stellar mass is significantly better constrained , with a scatter of @xmath46 .",
    "nevertheless , this property is generally overestimated by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "even if we exclude the galaxies with low s / n nir photometry , we still obtain photometric stellar masses which are on average a factor of @xmath67 too high . this overestimation is lower than the factor of 2 found by @xcite for blue galaxies",
    ". however , the values are not directly comparable , as their mass ratio is derived by using spectroscopic or photometric redshifts when fitting @xmath68 and irac photometry . in figure  [ what ] we find that the improved constraints on stellar mass is evenly driven by a better constrained redshift and the higher resolution spectral shape ( see also table  [ tab_scatter ] ) .",
    "thus , spectroscopic redshifts combined with broadband photometry may still overestimate the stellar mass , although by a small factor of @xmath69 .    in figure  [ prop ]",
    "we also show the comparison between the photometrically and spectroscopically derived @xmath53 , rest - frame magnitude @xmath70 and rest - frame @xmath32 color . of all photometric properties",
    "@xmath53 is the best determined , and shows no systematic offset .",
    "rest - frame @xmath32 colors are in general underestimated by @xmath71 mag , and show a scatter of @xmath72 for the galaxies with deep nir photometry .",
    "figure  [ what ] shows that the systematics and scatter are mainly due to the lack of a spectroscopic redshift .",
    "this effect is even worse for rest - frame @xmath70 magnitudes .",
    "as expected , rest - frame @xmath70 magnitudes can very accurately be determined once the redshift is known .",
    "thus , for photometric redshifts this quantity is less well constrained with an offset of @xmath72 and a scatter of @xmath73 for the deep nir photometry .    better constrained properties and confidence intervals",
    "can also be obtained by extending the broadband seds by mid - infrared spitzer / irac photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite show that the distribution of stellar population properties does not change significantly when irac data are added to their _ ubvijhk _ photometry .",
    "however , for individual galaxies the addition of irac can improve the constraints on the stellar populations significantly . as we do not have photometric catalogs including the irac bands for the gnirs galaxies yet , it is difficult to examine whether the irac bands have a similar effect as the higher resolution spectral shape on the stellar population properties .",
    "finally , we stress that the derived photometric and spectroscopic properties are not completely independent , as we use the same optical photometry for both , and the nir spectra are calibrated using the nir photometry .",
    "furthermore , the confidence levels do not include all uncertainties , as all photometrically and spectroscopically derived stellar population properties are based on the same assumptions , among which a @xcite imf , solar metallicity , an exponentially declining sfh , and the @xcite stellar population models .      in the previous section we examined the improvement of stellar population properties when including the spectroscopic information .",
    "however , due to the different redshift distributions , the photometric and spectroscopic properties as presented in figure  [ prop ] should not be compared directly to examine the implications for galaxy samples . due to degeneracies between redshift and stellar population properties",
    ", the systematic effects may even be worse for complete samples , than for individual galaxies .",
    "thus , it is important to consider the same redshift interval in order to examine the systematics of photometric samples .    in the top panels of figure  [ impl ] we show the photometric and spectroscopic properties stellar mass , rest - frame @xmath32 color , and observed @xmath30 and @xmath31 color versus redshift of the total gnirs sample .",
    "the photometrically derived properties are presented by open diamonds and the filled squares represent the spectroscopically derived properties .",
    "hence , all galaxies are shown twice .",
    "this figure illustrates how photometric and spectroscopic properties of galaxies in a certain redshift interval differ , and which galaxies fall out and in the targeted redshift interval ( @xmath74 ) when spectroscopic information is included .",
    "for example , several of the galaxies for which the photometric redshift and hence stellar mass were substantially overestimated , move to @xmath75 , and thus will not have a large effect on the properties of the @xmath74 sample .",
    "we note , however , that our spectroscopic sample is not complete , as galaxies with @xmath76 and @xmath77 may scatter into the spectroscopic sample .",
    "although the photometric sample contains 10 galaxies with @xmath77 , these galaxies may not be representative for all galaxies with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    in the bottom panels in figure  [ impl ] we compare the photometric and spectroscopic distributions of stellar mass , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and rest - frame @xmath32 of the @xmath74 galaxy sample .",
    "the first panel illustrates that photometric stellar masses in general are slightly overestimated . in order to compare how the properties of a mass - limited sample would change ,",
    "we use a mass - cut of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for the `` spectroscopic '' sample and @xmath81 for the `` photometric '' sample ) in addition to the redshift interval for the remaining properties .",
    "the second panel demonstrates that spectroscopically derived rest - frame @xmath32 colors of a mass - limited sample at @xmath74 are slightly redder ( @xmath70.1 mag ) than inferred from just the photometry .",
    "furthermore , the distribution is peaked around @xmath82 , possibly indicating a red sequence ( m. kriek et al .",
    "2007 in preparation ) .",
    "also , the median @xmath30 color as inferred from the photometry is @xmath71  mag too blue , while the median @xmath31 is @xmath83  mag too red .",
    "this may reflect the fact that dusty galaxies ( see   [ sect_sys ] ) with relatively red @xmath31 and blue @xmath30 colors fall out of the sample , and move to lower redshift . nonetheless , the photometric and spectroscopic distributions are remarkably similar for both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the systematics in both the photometric mass and redshift distribution introduce a systematic in number of massive galaxies in a certain redshift interval , as shown in figure  [ impl ] .",
    "as both the photometric masses and redshifts at @xmath10 are generally overestimated , the number of massive galaxies and the mass density will be lower than inferred from the photometry .",
    "our sample is too small to directly quantify this effect .",
    "however , we can use the originally photometric sample to estimate the change of the number of massive galaxies in certain redshift bins .",
    "we construct a @xmath0-selected ( @xmath84 ) photometric galaxy sample from the deep musyc catalog , and correct this sample using the coupled distributions of @xmath62  and @xmath85 . for these distributions we solely use the gnirs galaxies in the deep fields ( excluding ecdfs galaxies ) . as",
    "galaxies will scatter in and out of the relevant redshift interval ( @xmath5 ) from both low and high redshift , we start with a photometric sample over a larger redshift interval ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we randomly apply the coupled distributions to the original sample , and repeat this process 1000 times . from the original sample and all 1000 simulations we construct a mass - limited sample ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we apply the mass - cut after correcting , as galaxies that do not make the cut in the original sample can still scatter into the corrected sample .",
    "the depth of the @xmath0-selected catalog allows extraction of an almost complete mass - limited sample @xcite .",
    "finally , we divide the sample in redshift bins of @xmath870.1 and average the simulation to construct the final corrected number distribution .",
    "figure  [ model_n ] presents both the original and corrected number distributions of a mass - limited sample as a function of redshift .",
    "the difference in the original and corrected distribution in figure  [ model_n ] shows that photometric studies may overestimate the number of massive galaxies by a factor of @xmath71.3 at @xmath5 .",
    "however , this test is a simplification .",
    "first , we used the same coupled distributions of @xmath62  and @xmath85 randomly for all galaxies , while we know that there are correlations between @xmath47  and s / n of the photometry , @xmath0 magnitude , sed type etc .",
    "( see   [ sect_sys ] ) .",
    "our spectroscopic sample is too small to quantify these correlations in an applicable form .",
    "second , our sample and thus the distributions of @xmath47  and @xmath88 may be incomplete . for example",
    ", it may be that we miss galaxies with a @xmath29@xmath89 and a @xmath28@xmath46 . a larger sample over a larger redshift range in needed to better understand the systematics .",
    "at this moment most studies of massive galaxies beyond @xmath12 rely on photometric redshifts .",
    "thus , the systematics found in this work will have consequences for previous studies , especially to those that use the same or a similar method to derive photometric redshifts . in this section",
    "we will discuss several studies and how our findings may affect their results .    using a photometric mass - limited sample ( @xmath90 ) @xcite recently showed that massive galaxies at @xmath5 have red rest - frame optical colors , and found a median @xmath30 and rest - frame @xmath32 color of 2.48 and 0.62 respectively .",
    "this study also contained the deep musyc fields ( in addition to several other deep fields ) and used the same photometric redshift code as used in this paper . in the previous section we showed that the distributions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 barely changes when including the spectroscopic information .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath32 color is slightly redder and more peaked , but this difference is consistent with the photometric errors .",
    "thus , our spectroscopic study does not change , but supports the overall conclusion by @xcite that the high mass end at @xmath5 is dominated by red galaxies .",
    "although the colors of massive galaxies at @xmath5 barely change when including spectroscopic information , the number of massive galaxies decreases ( see   [ phot_samples ] ) . this will be of importance for our understanding of the evolution of the mass density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the numerous low redshift spectroscopic surveys , photometric redshifts below @xmath91",
    "are well calibrated and have small uncertainties in the order of @xmath47@xmath92 .",
    "this results in well - calibrated masses . however , as shown in this paper , photometric redshifts beyond @xmath12 are generally poorly calibrated and may show strong systematics .",
    "these systematics may result in too high redshifts , and thus too high stellar masses .",
    "for the photometric redshift code and template set used in this paper , the evolution of the global stellar mass density between @xmath10 and @xmath93 would have been underestimated by a factor of @xmath71.3 , due to the combination of redshift and mass systematics . however ,",
    "this factor is almost entirely driven by overestimates of photometric redshifts .",
    "as other studies may use different @xmath29  codes and templates sets , they may not suffer from this effect .",
    "our results will also affect galaxy clustering studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxy clustering at high redshift is measured using the angular two - point correlation function .",
    "the angular correlation function can be converted into the spatial correlation function using the limber equation .",
    "the main ingredient in this equation is the redshift distribution .",
    "@xcite use the summed redshift probability distribution , in order to account for different @xmath29  errors of the individual galaxies . in the two bottom panels of figure  [ z_hist ] we compare the summed probability distributions of the photometric redshifts of the gnirs galaxies for both the full and deep sample , with the spectroscopic distribution . for the continuum redshifts",
    "we use the probability distribution as well .",
    "although the median of the distribution for both samples is slightly offset in redshift , the width of the distribution is similar .",
    "because the limber deprojection is more dependent on changes to the width of the distribution than the central value , the clustering results will not change significantly when using spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "one can argue that this might be coincidence and further study is necessary to confirm this .",
    "in this paper we present our complete nir spectroscopic survey for @xmath0-selected galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "we acquired high quality nir spectra ( 1 - 2.5 @xmath13 m ) with gnirs for a total sample of 36 galaxies .",
    "the galaxies were selected to be bright in @xmath0 ( @xmath6319.7 ) and have photometric redshifts in the range @xmath94 .",
    "all galaxies have photometric stellar masses @xmath79 . the distribution of observed @xmath30 , @xmath31 and photometric rest - frame @xmath32 colors are similar as those of a photometric mass - limited sample extracted from the deep musyc fields .",
    "this suggests that our spectroscopic sample is representative for a mass - limited ( @xmath33 ) sample at @xmath95 .",
    "our sample is not representative for a @xmath0-bright galaxy sample , as our redshift distribution is slightly higher . nevertheless , the distribution of photometric rest - frame @xmath32 colors is similar for the gnirs sample and the full @xmath0-bright photometric sample .",
    "we successfully derived spectroscopic redshifts for all galaxies . for 19 of the galaxies we detected rest - frame optical emission lines , which provided us with accurate redshift measurements . for the remaining galaxies we derived redshifts by modeling the continuum spectra in combination with the optical photometry .",
    "we tested this method using the emission - line galaxies , and found a scatter of @xmath96 , and no significant systematic offset .",
    "the continuum redshifts are more accurate for optically red galaxies , with large balmer/4000   breaks , and for redshifts for which the break falls in an atmospheric window .",
    "comparison with spectroscopic redshifts shows that the original photometric redshifts are generally overestimated by @xmath97 , and have a scatter of @xmath98 .",
    "both the systematic and the scatter are worse for galaxies with shallow nir photometry ( @xmath20 ) . for the galaxies with deeper nir photometry ( @xmath8 )",
    "we find a systematic offset of @xmath99 and a scatter of @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to shallow nir photometry , the lack of well calibrated galaxy templates is another important cause for the large systematics and scatter of photometric redshifts .",
    "especially , dusty and/or young galaxies have high @xmath47 .",
    "this may not be surprising as the original template set of our photometric redshift code lacked these galaxies .",
    "we almost completely remove the systematic offset when repeating the fitting procedure replacing the original templates by 6 seds chosen from fits to the spectroscopic sample .",
    "we examine other possible causes for the scatter and systematics in @xmath47  as well .",
    "emission line contamination is only of minor importance for this sample and may affect the @xmath29  for some individual galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we find a correlation with @xmath0-band magnitude , such that @xmath0-bright galaxies in general have larger @xmath47  than those faint in @xmath0 .",
    "this effect may be diminished by using a luminosity prior in the photometric redshift code .",
    "although improved photometric redshift codes and better templates may remove the systematics and decrease the scatter , photometric redshifts remain limited by the low resolution spectral shape , and are not likely to surpass a scatter of @xmath47@xmath1015 at the targeted redshift range  even for the galaxies with deep nir photometry .",
    "we note that obtaining photometry in narrower bands and for a larger number of filters may lead to better results than has typically been the case to date .    the spectroscopic stellar population properties ,",
    "as derived by modeling the spectral continuum shape together with optical photometry , allow us to examine the significance and reliability of the stellar population properties derived from the photometry alone .",
    "strikingly , the properties age , sfr , @xmath44 show a scatter of a factor of@xmath102 between the photometrically and spectroscopically derived properties . for @xmath4",
    "this scatter is @xmath43 mag .",
    "the improvement in age and @xmath44 is driven primarily by the higher resolution spectral shape , and less so by the better constrained redshift .",
    "for sfr and @xmath4 both effects are about equally important .",
    "the uncertainties in the photometric modeling seem reasonable , as for @xmath103 of the galaxies the photometric and spectroscopic properties are consistent within 1@xmath21 . nevertheless , the photometric and spectroscopic distributions are quite different , accounting for their errors .",
    "this may be caused by the fact that age , @xmath4 and @xmath44 suffer from systematics , due to degeneracies with the photometric redshift .",
    "for example , the photometric stellar population properties for several galaxies converge to the properties of best - fit templates , used in the photometric redshift code .",
    "this all implies that the best - fit photometric properties and especially their distribution are strongly biased .",
    "the photometrically derived stellar mass and mass - to - light ( @xmath53 ) ratio are best determined and show a scatter of a factor of @xmath46 with their spectroscopic analogues .",
    "however , the systematic offset in @xmath47  results in a systematic offset in @xmath104 , such that @xmath81 is about 30% too high for the galaxies with deep nir photometry .",
    "this systematic is canceled out in @xmath53 , as the @xmath105 suffers from similar systematics as @xmath106 .",
    "the improvement for both stellar mass and @xmath53 is about equally driven by the higher resolution spectral shape and the better constrained redshift .",
    "rest - frame @xmath70 magnitudes and @xmath32 colors are the derived properties which are most sensitive to photometric redshift uncertainties and low s / n photometry .",
    "the scatter between the photometrically and spectroscopically derived properties is 0.4 and 0.2 mag for @xmath70 and @xmath32 respectively for galaxies with deep nir photometry , and both increase by 50% when we include the galaxies with shallow photometry .",
    "the systematics in the photometric redshifts cause a systematic offset of -0.2 and -0.1 mag for @xmath70 and @xmath32 for galaxies with deep nir photometry .",
    "thus , for both the scatter and the systematics , the improvement is almost completely driven by better constrained redshifts .    in order to assess the impact of the identified systematics on complete photometric samples",
    ", we compared photometric and spectroscopic samples in the same mass and redshift range .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the distribution of @xmath30 and @xmath31 color barely changes for massive galaxies ( @xmath107 ) at @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the spectroscopy supports previous studies that red galaxies dominate the high mass end at @xmath10 .",
    "however , the combination of photometric redshift and stellar mass systematics also affect the number of massive galaxies .",
    "the photometric redshift code and template set used in this work overestimates the number of massive galaxies by factor of @xmath71.3 at @xmath5 , resulting in an underestimation of the stellar mass density between @xmath108 and @xmath93 .",
    "overall , our spectroscopic survey demonstrates the large uncertainties of best - fit photometric properties , and the necessity for accurate calibration of photometric studies .",
    "although this study is a step forward in understanding the systematics in photometric studies of massive galaxies at @xmath109 , larger spectroscopic samples over a larger redshift range are needed to fully map the systematics and accurately calibrate photometric studies .",

    "<S> using the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) , we have completed a near - infrared spectroscopic survey for @xmath0-bright galaxies at @xmath1 , selected from the musyc survey . </S>",
    "<S> we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission lines or from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000  break , and have an uncertainty in @xmath2 of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we use this unique sample to determine , for the first time , how accurately redshifts and other properties of massive high - redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have a systematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry ; the random error , however , will be hard to reduce below 5% . the spectra lead to significantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters . for most quantities </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectral resolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> properties such as the age , @xmath4 , current star formation rate , and the star formation history are generally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly stellar masses and mass - to - light ratios are among the most stable parameters from broadband data . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , photometric studies may overestimate the number of massive galaxies at @xmath5 , and thus underestimate the evolution of the stellar mass density . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the spectroscopy supports our previous finding that red galaxies dominate the high - mass end of the galaxy population at @xmath6 . </S>"
