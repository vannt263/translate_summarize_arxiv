    "the layered cobaltate na@xmath0coo@xmath1 has attracted much interesting in strong correlation research area due to its rich physics.@xcite as we know , the electronic ground state is strongly dependent on the na content in na@xmath0coo@xmath1@xcite in which the valence of co ion can be tuned by na content .",
    "moreover , the change of na content can also affect the structure of na@xmath5 ion layer .",
    "early electron diffraction and neutron diffraction measurements reveal a kaleidoscope of na@xmath5 ion patterns as a function of concentration.@xcite a detailed phase diagram of na@xmath5 ion layer structure was given by huang et al ..",
    "@xcite as shown in fig.1 , there are four different types of structure for na@xmath5 ion layer with different na content  h1 , h2 , h3 and o1 . in the four types of structure , there are three types of na@xmath5 ion site na(1)(2b ( 0 , 0 , 1/4 ) ) , na(2)(2c ( 2/3 , 1/3 , 1/4 ) ) and na(2)(6h ( 2x , x , 1/4 ) ) .",
    "the occupation probability of the above sites depends on both na content and temperature.@xcite it is expected that different na@xmath5 ion pattern corresponds to distinct physical properties .",
    "the relationship between structure of na@xmath5 ion layer and physical properties of co - o plane is believed to be an important key of understanding this system@xcite and becomes a hot issue in recent researches@xcite .",

    "more and more theoretical and experimental progress of na ordering@xcite show that na ordering plays an important role in understanding of the rich physical properties of co - o plane .",
    "however , direct experimental evidence of relationship between na ordering and physical properties of co - o plane is still limited@xcite . here , we report a systematically raman study in na@xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "it is found that an abnormal sodium dependence of e@xmath3 mode occurs around x=0.5 .",
    "temperature dependent raman study indicates that a possible na rearrangement transition from h1 to o1 phase defined by huang et al.@xcite occurs at x=0.56 .",

    "these results give a direct evidence for na ordering effect on the physical properties of co - o plane .",
    "high quality single crystals of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 were grown using the flux method ( x = 0.7 ) and floating zone technique ( x = 0.75 and 0.80 ) . the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 sample with x@xmath70.7 is prepared by sodium deintercalation of the na@xmath8coo@xmath1 singe crystals in solutions obtained by dissolving i@xmath1 ( 0.2 m , 0.02 m , 0.004 m ) or br@xmath1 ( 6.0 m ) in acetonitrile ( m is `` molar '' ) for 4 days at room temperature . the x values of the samples",
    "were estimated by the same method as previous paper.@xcite raman spectra were obtained on a labram - hr confocal laser microraman spectrometer using the 514.5 nm line from an argon - ion laser with in - plane light polarization .",
    "the single crystals were cleaved to obtain fresh surface before raman measurements .",
    "the resistance was measured by an ac resistance bridge ( lr-700 , linear research ) .",

    "all samples show two distinct raman modes around 467 @xmath9 and 561 @xmath9 , which can be attributed to raman - active in - plane e@xmath3 and out - of - plane a@xmath3 vibrations of oxygen in coo@xmath10 octahedra , respectively.@xcite the samples with x= 0.5 and 0.52 show additional modes around 425 @xmath9 , which is attributed to na@xmath5 ion ordering.@xcite in addition , both of two samples show a charge ordering behavior at low temperature which is consistent with the results by foo et al.@xcite and wu et al ..",

    "this broadening of the two modes maybe come from instability of ordering structure of na@xmath12 ions .",
    "the systematic changes of related raman shift of a@xmath3 and e@xmath3 with decreasing na content are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the raman shift of a@xmath3 mode is linearly suppressed with na content .",
    "this result is consistent with previous data.@xcite but it is surprising that the raman shift of e@xmath3 mode presents an abnormal shift around x = 0.5 , and this phenomenon is not observed in previous data.@xcite huang et al .",
    "have proposed a structural phase diagram based on different structure of na@xmath5 ion layer.@xcite present data indicate that the o1 structure may be corresponding to the abnormal shift of e@xmath3 mode . meanwhile , above results also indicate that the e@xmath3 mode is more sensitive to o1 structure than a@xmath3 mode , which can be used as the fingerprint of o1 structure .",
    "it should be emphasized that the temperature dependence of raman shift for e@xmath3 mode also shows a t - linear behavior except for that observed in the samples of @xmath13 with na ordering in o1 structure .",
    "since the in - plane na@xmath5 ion ordering happens between two neighboring coo@xmath10 layers , it is also easy to understand why the out - of - plane a@xmath3 mode has no distinct change .",
    "recently , multi - vacancy model was proposed to understand the na ordering phenomenon@xcite and na rearrangement phenomena were also found for x@xmath60.5.@xcite the above results suggest that a possible na rearrangement transition occurs around x=0.5 and e@xmath3 mode is a good indicator .     and e@xmath3 mode at ambient temperature .",
