    "the classical variational inequality problem ( vip ) is to find a point @xmath7 such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is nonempty , closed and convex , @xmath6 is a given operator,@xmath10and @xmath11 denotes the inner product in @xmath12 .",
    "this problem , denoted by vip@xmath13 , is a fundamental problem in optimization theory because many optimization problems can be translated into vips .",
    "the vip was intensively studied in the last decades ; see , _ e.g. _ , the two - volume book by facchinei and pang @xcite , and the review papers by noor @xcite and by xiu and zhang @xcite . some algorithms for solving ( [ eq : classicvip ] ) fit into the framework of the following general iterative scheme:@xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the metric projection  operator onto @xmath17 ( see auslender @xcite and consult ( * ? ? ? * volume 2 , subsection 12.1 ) for more details ) .",
    "such methods are particularly useful when the set @xmath17 is simple enough to project onto . however , in general , one has to solve a minimization problem ( evaluation of the metric projection onto @xmath17 ) at each iterative step in order to get the next iterate . in this case the efficiency of method ( [ eq : aus ] ) may be seriously affected .",
    "fukushima @xcite developed a method that overcomes this obstacle by replacing the metric projection onto the set @xmath17  by a subgradient projection which is easier to calculate .",
    "censor and gibali present in @xcite the @xmath18-algorithmic scheme which generalizes the auslender and fukushima algorithms in the sense that there is some freedom  in choosing the hyperplane onto which one projects .",
    "in this paper we present a natural extension of this @xmath18-algorithmic scheme ( algorithm [ alg : ac ] below ) . given an operator @xmath4 , we denote by @xmath19 the fixed point set of @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath21 is closed and convex if @xmath20 is quasi - nonexpansive ( see , _",

    "* proposition 2.6 ( ii ) ) ) .",
    "observe that the feasible set @xmath17 of the vip  in ( [ eq : classicvip ] ) can always be represented as the fixed point set of some operator , say , @xmath22 .",
    "following this idea , yamada and ogura @xcite considered the variational inequality problem vip@xmath23 , which calls for finding a point @xmath24 such that@xmath25 in the case where @xmath20 is quasi - nonexpansive and so - called quasi - shrinking , an algorithm for solving ( [ eq : vip ] ) in a real hilbert space was proposed in @xcite under the conditions of lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity of @xmath26 .",
    "the iterative step of the method is as follows:@xmath27 where @xmath28 is a nonnegative sequence which satisfies certain conditions . as a matter of fact , yamada and ogura ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5 ) showed that ( [ eq : yamada ] ) could be applied to more general cases with weaker monotonicity assumptions , such as paramonotonicity ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we present a method for solving the vip@xmath23 when the operator @xmath20 is merely quasi - nonexpansive .",
    "this method generalizes the earlier results of auslender and fukushima , as well as the @xmath18-algorithmic scheme .",
    "in addition , we present the relationship between our algorithm and the yamada ",

    "note that several authors have considered the vip@xmath23 for a quasi - nonexpansive operator @xmath20 and proposed methods similar to ( [ eq : yamada ] ) , where @xmath20 is replaced by a sequence of quasi - nonexpansive operators @xmath29 with the property @xmath30 ( see @xcite ) .",
