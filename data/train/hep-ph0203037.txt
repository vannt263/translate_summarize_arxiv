    "if our present research direction of the string and d - brane is right , the unification of various forces should be , effectively at some scale , explained by some higher - dimensional theory .",
    "then it is quite sure that the real world of 4 dimensions should be some approximation of the higher dimensional one .",
    "it is realized by the procedure called _",
    "dimensional reduction_. there are two representative and contrastive approaches , that is , the kaluza - klein and the randall - sundrum theories . in the former case ,",
    "the reduction is achieved by the _ compactification _ of the extra space , while in the latter one it is done by the _ localization _ of the configuration along the extra dimension(s ) .",
    "the two approaches look to have both advantages and disadvantages in the phenomenological application . here",
    "we treat them in a comparative way and examine their 4 dimensional(d ) reduction properties .",
    "we will present the higher dimensional approach to the cp - violation mechanism . as was stressed by thirring for the kk model@xcite ,",
    "the cp - violation naturally occurs also in the rs model .",
    "let us first review the 5d kaluza - klein theory .",
    "this serves as the preparation for the same treatment of the randall - sundrum theory in the next section . the 5d space - time manifold",
    "is described by the 4d coordinates @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and an extra coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "we also use the notation ( @xmath3)=(@xmath4 ) , ( @xmath5 ) . with the general 5d metric @xmath6 :   @xmath7 , we assume the @xmath8 compactification condition for the extra space :   @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the _ radius _ of the extra space circle .",
    "we specify the form of the metric as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the 4d metric , the u(1 ) gauge field and the dilaton field respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is a coupling constant .",
    "this specification is based on the following additional assumptions :   1 .",
    "@xmath2 is a space coordinate ;   2 .",
    "the geometry is invariant under the u(1 ) symmetry , @xmath15 .",
    "we take @xmath16 in ( [ kk1c ] ) for simplicity .",
    "we take the cartan formalism to compute the geometric quantities@xcite .",
    "the basis \\{@xmath17 } ( @xmath18 are the local lorentz ( tangent ) frame indices ) of the cotangent manifold(@xmath19 ) and the fnf - bein @xmath20 are obtained as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the 4d part of @xmath20 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the first cartan s structure equation gives the connection 1-form @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the 4d part .",
    "the 5d dirac equation is generally given by @xmath28-{{\\hat m}}\\right\\}{{\\hat \\psi}}=0 . \\label{ferkk1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spin connection above @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "the 5d dirac matrix @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    "we switch off the 4d gravity : @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the 5d fermion mass . in the present case ,",
    "using ( [ kk5 ] ) and ( [ kk9 ] ) , the eq.([ferkk1 ] ) says @xmath35-{{\\hat m}}\\right\\}{{\\hat \\psi}}=0 { { \\quad .}}\\label{ferkk2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider the following form of the fermion :   @xmath36 .",
    "here we regard the fermion as a kk-_massive _ mode .",
    "the angle parameter @xmath37 is chosen as @xmath38 then ( [ ferkk2 ] ) reduces to @xmath39 \\right\\}\\psi=0 { { \\quad , } } \\label{ferkk5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the electric coupling constant .",
    "we notice , in this expression , the electric and magnetic moments appear .",
    "@xmath41\\psi,\\   -\\frac{i}{16}\\frac{1}{m}ef_{ab}{{\\bar \\psi}}[{\\gamma}^a,{\\gamma}^b]\\psi . \\label{ferkk6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term violate the cp symmetry . note that the second term usually appear , in the 4d qed , as the _ quantum _ effects .",
    "let us do the order estimation . from the reduction of @xmath42 , @xmath43 we know @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this gives @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "we know @xmath47 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "assuming @xmath49 , we can estimate the electric and magnetic couplings as @xmath50 which is _ far below _",
    "the experimental upper bound of the neutron electric dipole moment @xmath51e cm .",
    "we consider the following 5d space - time geometry@xcite .",
    "@xmath52 where @xmath53 is regarded as a scale factor field . @xmath54 . when the geometry is ads@xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "such a situation , in the present case , occurs in the asymptotic region of the extra space @xmath57 .",
    "the 1-form @xmath17 , the fnf - bein @xmath20 and the connection 1-form @xmath25 are given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 .    as the fermion model , the ( 5d ) dirac theory ( [ ferkk1 ] ) , @xmath60 , is not accepted physically because the fermion configuration does not localize ( around @xmath61 ) in the extra space .",
    "nature requires the _",
    "yukawa interaction _ between the 5d fermion and the 5d higgs@xcite .",
    "hence we examine the fermion behavior under the yukawa coupling with the higgs scalar :   @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the 5d(bulk ) higgs scalar field and @xmath64 is the yukawa coupling .",
    "this reduces to @xmath65 a solution of the right chirality zero mode :   @xmath66 , is obtained by @xmath67 in the far region , the solution behaves as @xmath68 , which shows the _ exponentially damping _ for the large yukawa coupling @xmath69 .",
    "( @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the asymptotic values of @xmath72 and @xmath73@xcite . )",
    "this is called _ massless chiral fermion localization_. in the near region , @xmath74 , which shows the _ gaussian damping_. ( @xmath75 is the _ thickness _ parameter of the wall . )    now we analyze the 5d qed , @xmath76 , with the yukawa interaction in rs geometry :   @xmath77 . we assume , as in the previous paragraph , @xmath78 and @xmath63 are the brane background obtained from the gravitational and higgs systems : @xmath79 .        then the effective action is integrated as @xmath83 in the _ thin wall limit _ we may approximate as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the step function . under the u(1 ) gauge transformation @xmath86 , @xmath87 changes as @xmath88 where @xmath89 . in the above",
    "we assume that the boundary term vanishes .",
    "callan and harvey interpreted this result as the `` anomaly flow '' between the boundary ( our 4d world ) and the bulk@xcite .",
    "another interesting bulk quantum effect is given by fig.1(right ) .",
    "the induced effective action @xmath82 is expected to satisfy @xmath90 then @xmath82 is obtained as , in the thin wall limit , @xmath91 this term is the `` dual '' of the magnetic moment term of ( [ ferkk6 ] ) . it is a cp - violating term .",
    "the coupling depends on the vacuum expectation value of @xmath63 .",
