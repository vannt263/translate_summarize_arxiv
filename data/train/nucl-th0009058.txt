    "this presentation is a cartoon of the effective field theory ( eft ) of two and three nucleon systems as it emerged in the last three years , using a lot of words and figures , and a few cheats . for details ,",

    "i will mainly concentrate on the theory in which pions are integrated out as explicit degrees of freedom , but also comment on the extensions to include pions .",
    "b.  holstein s talk  @xcite provides an introduction to eft , and e.  epelbaum s contribution  @xcite investigates one of the two proposals to include pions in more detail .",
    "effective field theory methods are largely used in many branches of physics where a separation of scales exists  @xcite . in low energy nuclear systems ,",
    "the scales are , on one side , the low scales of the typical momentum of the process considered and the pion mass , and on the other side the higher scales associated with chiral symmetry and confinement .",
    "this separation of scales produces a low energy expansion , resulting in a description of strongly interacting particles which is systematic and rigorous .",
    "it is also model independent ( meaning , independent of assumptions about the non - perturbative qcd dynamics ) : given that qcd is the theory of strong interactions and that chiral symmetry is broken via the goldstone mechanism , wilson s renormalisation group arguments show that there is only one local low energy field theory which originates from it : chiral perturbation theory and its extension to the many - nucleon system discussed here .",
    "three main ingredients enter the construction of an eft : the lagrangean , the power counting and a regularisation scheme .",
    "first , the relevant degrees of freedom have to be identified . in his original suggestion how to extend eft methods to systems containing two or more nucleons",
    ", weinberg  @xcite noticed that below the @xmath1 production scale , only nucleons and pions need to be retained as the infrared relevant degrees of freedom of low energy qcd .",
    "because at these scales the momenta of the nucleons are small compared to their rest mass , the theory becomes non - relativistic at leading order in the velocity expansion , with relativistic corrections systematically included at higher orders .",
    "the most general chirally invariant lagrangean consists hence of contact interactions between non - relativistic nucleons , and between nucleons and pions , with the first terms of the form @xmath2\\;+",

    "the iso - vector - scalar part of the @xmath6 lagrangean introduces more constants @xmath7 and interactions and has not been displayed for convenience .",
    "the field @xmath8 describes the pion .",
    "@xmath9 is the chirally covariant derivative , and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) the axial ( vector ) pionic current .",
    "the interactions involving pions are severely restricted by chiral invariance . as such",
    ", the theory is an extension of chiral perturbation theory and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory to the many nucleon system . like in its cousins , the coefficients of the low energy lagrangean",
    "encode all short distance physics ",
    "branes and strings , quarks and gluons , resonances like the @xmath1 or @xmath12  as strengths of the point - like interactions between particles .",
    "as it is not possible yet to derive these constants by solving qcd e.g.  on the lattice , the most practical way to determine them is by fitting to experiment .",
    "because the lagrangean ( [ ksw ] ) consists of infinitely many terms only restricted by symmetry , an eft may at first sight suffer from lack of predictive power .",
    "indeed , as the second part of an eft formulation , predictive power is ensured by establishing a power counting scheme , i.e.  a way to determine at which order in a momentum expansion different contributions will appear , and keeping only and all the terms up to a given order .",
    "the dimensionless , small parameter on which the expansion is based is the typical momentum @xmath13 of the process in units of the scale @xmath14 at which the theory is expected to break down .",
    "values for @xmath14 and @xmath13 have to be determined from comparison to experiments and are a priori unknown .",
    "assuming that all contributions are of natural size , i.e.  ordered by powers of @xmath13 , the systematic power counting ensures that the sum of all terms left out when calculating to a certain order in @xmath13 is smaller than the last order retained , allowing for an error estimate of the final result .",
    "for extremely small momenta , the pion does not enter as explicit degree of freedom , and all its effects are absorbed into the coefficients @xmath7 . this effective nuclear theory with pions integrated out ( ent(@xmath15 ) )",
    "was recently pushed to very high orders in the two - nucleon sector  @xcite where accuracies of the order of @xmath16 were obtained .",
    "it can be viewed as a systematisation of effective range theory with the inclusion of relativistic and short distance effects traditionally left out in that approach .",
    "because of non - analytic contributions from the pion cut , the breakdown scale of this theory must be of the order @xmath17 . for the ent with explicit pions , we would suspect the breakdown scale to be of the order of @xmath18 , since the @xmath1 is not an explicit degree of freedom in ( [ ksw ] ) .",
    "even if calculations of nuclear properties were possible starting from the underlying qcd lagrangean , eft simplifies the problem considerably by factorising it into a long distance part which contains the infrared - relevant physics and is dealt with by eft methods and a short distance part , subsumed into the coefficients of the lagrangean .",
    "qcd therefore `` only '' has to provide these constants , avoiding full - scale calculations of e.g.  bound state properties of two nuclear systems using quarks and gluons .",
    "eft provides an answer of finite accuracy because higher order corrections are systematically calculable and suppressed in powers of @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the power counting allows for an error estimate of the final result , with the natural size of all neglected terms known to be of higher order .",
    "relativistic effects , chiral dynamics and external currents are included systematically , and extensions to include e.g.  parity violating effects are straightforward . gauged",
    "interactions and exchange currents are unambiguous .",
    "results obtained with eft are easily dissected for the relative importance of the various terms . because only @xmath19-matrix elements between on - shell states are observables , ambiguities nesting in `` off - shell effects ''",
    "are absent . on the other hand , because only symmetry considerations enter the construction of the lagrangean , efts are less restrictive as no assumption about the underlying qcd dynamics is incorporated .",
    "hence the proverbial quib that `` eft parameterises our ignorance '' .    in systems involving two or more nucleons , establishing a power counting is complicated because unnaturally large scales have to be accommodated : given that the typical low energy scale in the problem should be the mass of the pion as the lightest particle emerging from qcd , fine tuning is required to produce the large scattering lengths in the @xmath20 wave channels ( @xmath21 ) . since there is a bound state in the @xmath22 channel with a binding energy @xmath23 and hence a typical binding momentum @xmath24 well below the scale @xmath14 at which the theory should break down , it is also clear that at least some processes have to be treated non - perturbatively in order to accommodate the deuteron , i.e.  an infinite number of diagrams has to be summed .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us first turn to the eft in which the pion is integrated out into the coefficients @xmath25 of the lagrangean . here , a way to incorporate this fine tuning into the power counting",
    "was suggested by kaplan , savage and wise  @xcite , and by van kolck  @xcite . at very low momenta ,",
    "contact interactions with several derivatives ",
    "like @xmath26  should become unimportant , and we are left only with the contact interactions proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the leading order contribution to nucleons scattering in an @xmath20 wave comes hence from four nucleon contact interactions and is summed geometrically as in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] in order to produce the shallow real bound state , i.e.  the deuteron .",
    "@xmath28    how to justify this ?",
    "dimensional analysis allows any diagram to be estimated by scaling momenta by a factor of @xmath13 and non - relativistic kinetic energies by a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "the remaining integral includes no dimensions and is taken to be of the order @xmath30 and of natural size .",
    "this scaling implies the rule that nucleon propagators contribute one power of @xmath31 and each loop a power of @xmath32 . assuming that @xmath33 the diagrams contributing at leading order to the deuteron propagator are indeed an infinite number as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] , each one of the order @xmath34 .",
    "the deuteron propagator @xmath35 has the correct pole position and cut structure when one chooses @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath27 becomes dependent on an arbitrary scale @xmath37 because of the regulator dependent , linear uv divergence in each of the bubble diagrams .",
    "indeed , when choosing @xmath38 , the leading order contact interaction scales as demanded in ( [ scalingksw ] ) . as expected for a physical observable , the @xmath6 scattering amplitude becomes independent of @xmath37 , the renormalisation scale or cut - off chosen .",
    "all other coefficients @xmath25 can be shown to be higher order , so that the scheme is self - consistent .",
    "observables are independent of the cut - off chosen",
    ".    the linear divergence does not show in dimensional regularisation as a pole in @xmath39 dimensions , but it does appear as a pole in @xmath40 dimensions which we subtract following the power divergence subtraction scheme  @xcite .",
    "dimensional regularisation is chosen to explicitly preserve the systematic power counting as well as all symmetries ( esp .",
    "chiral invariance ) at each order in every step of the calculation . at leading ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and often even n3lo in the two nucleon system",
    ", it also allows for simple , closed answers whose analytic structure is readily asserted .",
    "power divergence subtraction moves hence a somewhat arbitrary amount of the short distance contributions from loops to counterterms and makes precise cancellations manifest which arise from fine tuning  @xcite .",
    "the power counting of the zero and one nucleon sector of the theory are fixed by chiral perturbation theory and its extension to the one baryon sector .",
    "therefore , the question to be posed is : how does the power counting of the contact terms @xmath25 change above the pion cut , i.e.  when the pion must be included as explicit degree of freedom ?",
    "we do not know yet , but the following two promising proposals are on the market .",
    "if pulling out pion effects does not affect the running of @xmath41 too much , one surprising result arises : because chiral symmetry implies a derivative coupling of the pion to the nucleon at leading order , the instantaneous one pion exchange scales as @xmath30 and is _ smaller _ than the contact piece @xmath42 .",
    "pion exchange and higher derivative contact terms appear hence only as perturbations at higher orders .",
    "the lo contribution in this scheme is still given by the geometric series in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] . in contradistinction to iterative potential model approaches , each higher order contribution is inserted only once . in this scheme , the only non - perturbative physics responsible for nuclear binding is extremely simple , and the more complicated pion contributions are at each order given by a finite number of diagrams .",
    "for example , the nlo contributions to the deuteron are the one instantaneous pion exchange and the four nucleon interaction with two derivatives , fig .  [",
    "fig : nloksw ] .",
    "the constants are determined e.g.  by demanding the correct deuteron pole position and residue .",
    "this approach is known as the `` ksw '' counting of ent , ent(ksw )  @xcite .",
    "+    if on the other hand , the power counting for @xmath27 is dramatically modified when one includes pions , both the @xmath41 interactions and the one pion exchange might have to be iterated . in his paper , weinberg  @xcite therefore suggested to power count not the amplitude  as is usually done in eft  but the potential , and then to solve a schrdinger equation with a chiral potential , as pictorially represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : weinberg ] .",
    "e.  epelbaum s talk  @xcite gives more details on the results obtained so far in this approach .",
    "@xmath43    both power countings are presently under investigation for consistency and convergence , and each has its advantages and shortcomings  @xcite .",
    "if both approaches are self - consistent , nature will tell us which it chose .",
    "although in general process dependent , the expansion parameter is found to be of the order of @xmath44 in most applications , so that nlo calculations can be expected to be accurate to about @xmath45 , and n2lo calculations to about @xmath46 . in all cases ,",
    "experimental agreement is within the estimated theoretical uncertainties , and in some cases , previously unknown counterterms could be determined .",
    "the first example we turn to demonstrates not only how simple it is to compute processes involving both external gauge and exchange currents in a self - consistent way , but especially how powerful the power counting is in estimates of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "using the power counting ent(ksw ) in which pions are perturbative , the elastic deuteron compton scattering cross section  @xcite to nlo is parameter - free with an accuracy of @xmath45",
    ". contributions at nlo include the pion graphs that dominate the electric polarisability of the nucleon @xmath47 from their @xmath48 behaviour in the chiral limit .",
    "because they are nlo , the power counting predicts their contribution to be sizeable , namely @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "the comparison with experiment in fig .  [ fig : compton ] shows good agreement and therefore confirms the hb@xmath51pt value for @xmath47 .",
    "the deuteron scalar and tensor electric and magnetic polarisabilities are also easily extracted  @xcite .",
    "-deuteron compton scattering at incident photon energies of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eft(ksw )  @xcite , no free parameters .",

    "surprisingly , the results all agree within the theoretical uncertainty of the calculations even at relatively high momenta .",
    "this seems to suggest that non - analytic pion contributions from meson exchange diagrams are small .",
    "since all interactions permitted by the symmetries must be included into the lagrangean , eft dictates that in the three body sector , interactions like @xmath55 with unknown strength @xmath56 are present . turning again to ent(@xmath15 )",
    ", we therefore have to ask at which order in the power counting they will start to contribute .",
    "bedaque , hammer and van kolck  @xcite found the surprising result that an unusual renormalisation makes the three body force of leading order in the triton channel .    in order to understand this finding , let us first consider the lo diagrams which come from two nucleon interactions .",
    "the absence of coulomb interactions in the @xmath0 system ensures that only properties of the strong interactions are probed .",
    "all graphs involving only @xmath27 interactions are of the same order and form a double series which can not be written down in closed form . summing all `` bubble - chain '' sub - graphs into the deuteron propagator",
    ", one can however obtain the solution numerically from the integral equation pictorially shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lofaddeev ] within seconds on a personal computer .",
    "@xmath57 @xmath57 @xmath57 @xmath58 + @xmath59 @xmath57    because one nucleon is exchanged in the intermediate state , each diagram is of the order of the nucleon propagator , i.e.  @xmath60 , while the first three buddy force ( [ threebodyterm ] ) seems to be of order @xmath30 .",
    "we are therefore tempted to assume that three body forces are at worst n2lo , i.e.  of the order @xmath45 .",
    "in the quartet channel , power counting suggests even n4lo because the pauli principle forbids three body forces without derivatives . however , such nave counting was already fallacious in the two body sector because of the presence of a low lying bound state and of a linear divergence in each of the bubble graphs making up fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteronprop ] .",
    "we therefore investigate more carefully the uv behaviour of the amplitude @xmath61 at half off - shell momenta @xmath62 .",

    "the equation is easily solved by a mellin transformation , @xmath68 , and indeed in most channels @xmath69 is real so that only one solution exists which vanishes at infinite momentum and hence is cut - off independent .",
    "however , the fact that the kernel of ( [ uvfaddeev ] ) is not compact makes one suspicious whether this is always the case .",
    "indeed , there exists one and only one partial wave in which two linearly independent solutions are found : the doublet @xmath20 wave ( triton ) channel , where @xmath70 . therefore in this channel ,",

    "[ fig : lofaddeev ] , the on - shell amplitude @xmath73 will also depend crucially on @xmath71 .",
    "this means that the on - shell amplitude seems sensitive to off - shell physics , and what is more , to a phase which stems from arbitrarily high momenta . a numerical study of the full half off - shell amplitude confirms these findings , fig .",
    "[ fig : phillipsline ] .",
    "this can not be .    because physics must be independent of the cut - off chosen , this sensitivity of the on - shell amplitude on uv properties of the solution to ( [ fig : lofaddeev ] )",
    "must be remedied by adding a counter term . and",
    "since the power counting in the two nucleon sector is fixed , one can show that a necessary and sufficient condition to render cut - off independent results is to promote the three body force ( [ threebodyterm ] ) to lo , @xmath74 , and absorb all phase dependence into it , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lotriton ] . the variation of @xmath75 with the cut - off or phase is known analytically from ( [ uvsolution ] ) , but its initial value is unknown .",
    "therefore , one physical scale @xmath76 must be determined experimentally .",
