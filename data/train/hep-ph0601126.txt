    "the standard model ( sm ) requires a higgs boson to explain the generation of fermion and gauge boson masses .",

    "in addition , the triviality bound indicates that the sm with a light higgs can be a theory valid all the way up to the planck scale .",
    "this simple assumption of the sm with a single higgs doublet , however , has the theoretical problem that the higgs boson mass is quadratically sensitive to any new physics which may arise at high energy scales . to cancel these quadratic divergences due to the sm particles , a set of new states , which are related to the sm particles by some symmetry , have to appear at the tev scale .",
    "little higgs ( lh ) models are a new approach to stabilizing the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "these models have an expanded gauge structure at the tev scale which contains the standard model @xmath2 electroweak gauge groups .",

    "there is generally a tension between the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem and the ew precision fit , nevertheless .",
    "the deviations from the sm predictions due to the presence of new interactions above the sm cutoff scale , @xmath3 , can be parameterized by a set of higher dimensional operators which have been classified in ref .   .",

    "these bounds indicate that the cutoff scale @xmath3 has to be above 5 tev .",

    "the new ingredient in the little higgs models is the so - called collective symmetry breaking .",
    "the idea is to choose the gauge and yukawa interactions in such a way that by turning off some part of these interactions , the model has enhanced global symmetries that forbid a quadratic contribution to the higgs mass . as a result",

    "these models have the following general structure : at the electroweak scale , @xmath8 gev , there are one or two higgs doublets and possibly a few additional scalar fields ; at the scale @xmath9 tev , there exist new gauge bosons and fermions ; above the cut - off scale of the non - linear sigma model , @xmath10 tev , the model becomes strongly interacting .",

    "i review various little higgs models and the precision ew constraints placed in them . in most of these models , the parameter space is severely constrained by the precise electroweak data , with the exception of the littlest higgs model with t - parity , in which a low cutoff scale is allowed .",
    "the importance of a full one - loop calculation is also emphasized and demonstrated explicitly in the case of the littlest higgs model .",
    "there are other important questions such as the uv completion , vacuum stability and the contributions to the electroweak precision observables from higher dimensional operators at the cutoff scale , which are either out of the scope of this review or have only been briefly mentioned .",
    "more careful studies on these issues are clearly needed .",
