    "in this section , we briefly review our survey of @xmath20 quasars selected in the sdss . we will need this information for sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the sky using a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope @xcite at apache point observatory .",
    "imaging was carried out in drift - scan mode using a 142 mega - pixel camera @xcite which gathered data in five broad bands , @xmath33 , spanning the range from 3000 to 10,000   @xcite , on moonless photometric @xcite nights of good seeing .",
    "the effective exposure time was 54.1 seconds .",
    "an sdss run ( strip ) consists of 6 parallel scanlines ( camera columns ) for each of the five @xmath33 bands .",
    "the scanlines are @xmath34 wide with gaps of roughly the same width , so two interleaving strips make a stripe .",
    "sdss scanlines are divided into fields , and a field is the union of five @xmath33 frames covering the same region of sky .",
    "the images were processed using specialized software @xcite , and are photometrically @xcite and astrometrically @xcite calibrated using observations of a set of primary standard stars @xcite on a neighboring 20-inch telescope .",
    "the initial goal of the sdss imaging survey was to scan 8500 deg@xmath3 of the north galactic cap .",
    "the total unique area was expanded to 14,555 deg@xmath3 , by adding @xmath355000 deg@xmath3 in the south galactic cap ( sgc ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered 19 @xmath0 quasars from the sdss photometry , primarily in the north galactic cap .",
    "most of these quasars are bright ( @xmath2 mag ) , and were selected from single - epoch imaging data ( hereafter referred to as the sdss main survey ) .",
    "they represent the most luminous quasars at @xmath19 .",
    "however , there were main survey regions remaining unsearched , particularly in the sgc . in this paper",
    "we report on the discovery of additional quasars found in these regions .",
    "the quasar selection procedure in the main survey has been discussed in detail in the papers mentioned above . here",
    "we briefly review the procedure . because of the rarity of high - redshift quasars and overwhelming number of contaminants , the procedure consists of four basic steps .",
    "the first step is to select @xmath36-band dropout objects mainly in high galactic latitude @xmath37 .",
    "sources with @xmath38 mag and @xmath25-band error @xmath39 mag ( roughly @xmath40 mag ) that were not detected in the @xmath41 bands are selected as @xmath36-dropout objects .",
    "the simple color cut @xmath38 is used to separate quasars ( and cool brown dwarfs ) from the majority of stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . beyond the limit of @xmath39 mag , the number of contaminants increases dramatically .",
    "the second step is to remove false @xmath36-dropout objects and improve photometry .",
    "all @xmath36-dropout objects are visually inspected , and false detections such as cosmic rays are removed . if necessary , we also take deeper imaging data to improve the @xmath36 and @xmath25-band photometry to reduce the number of contaminants .",
    "the third step is to take near - ir ( usually @xmath42 band ) photometry of @xmath36-dropout objects with another telescope . in the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 color - color diagram ,",
    "high - redshift quasar candidates are separated from brown dwarfs .",
    "specifically , quasar candidates satisfy the criterion @xmath45 ( see also figure [ fig : colorselect ] ) . the final step is to take spectroscopic observations and identify quasar candidates .",
    "in addition to the above ` standard ' survey to a limit of @xmath46 detections in the sdss @xmath25-band images , we also selected two small samples of quasar candidates using a ` non - standard ' method . the first sample consisted of candidates down to @xmath47 in the @xmath25-band images in part of the ukidss footprint .",
    "this is similar to the test done by @xcite .",
    "we used a more stringent color cut @xmath48 mag to reduce the number of contaminants caused by larger photometric uncertainties .",
    "we further required that the candidates should be detected at a significance level of @xmath49 in the ukidss @xmath50 and @xmath42 bands .",
    "two of the quasars in this paper were selected using this method .",
    "the second ` non - standard ' sample consisted of several candidates with @xmath44 colors between 2.1 and 2.2 mag , slightly bluer than that used for the ` standard ' survey .",
    "one quasar in this paper was selected using this method .",
    "in addition to the single - epoch main imaging survey , the sdss also conducted a deep survey by repeatedly imaging a @xmath27 deg@xmath3 area on the celestial equator in the south galactic cap @xcite .",
    "this deep survey stripe , or stripe 82 , roughly spans @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and was scanned 7090 times in total , depending on r.a . along the stripe .",
    "the multi - epoch data have been used to construct co - added images that can reach two magnitudes deeper than the sdss single - epoch images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using these co - added data , we have found 12 @xmath20 quasars in stripe 82 @xcite .",
    "these quasars have @xmath53 mag , and are on average two magnitudes fainter than those found in the main survey . in this paper",
    "we present one new quasar found in stripe 82 .",
    "the quasar selection procedure for stripe 82 is very similar to that for the main survey , except that the survey limit is @xmath54 mag ( @xmath55 mag ) instead of @xmath56 mag .",
    "we have also carried out searches of @xmath0 quasars in the sdss overlap regions , the regions that were scanned by two or more sdss imaging runs .",
    "the sdss imaging runs generally overlap each other , due to the survey geometry and strategy .",
    "the imaging survey in drift - scan mode was along great circles , and had two common poles .",
    "the fields overlap more substantially when they approach the survey poles .",
    "in addition , the two interleaving strips that make any stripe overlap slightly , leading to repeat observations in a small area . furthermore ,",
    "if the quality of a run , or part of a run , did not meet the sdss standard seeing and photometric criteria , the relevant region was re - observed , yielding duplicate observations in this region .",
    "the total area of the overlap regions is more than one - fourth of the sdss footprint .",
    "these overlap regions provide a unique dataset that allows us to select high - redshift quasars more than 0.5 mag fainter ( in the @xmath25 band ) than those found with the sdss single - epoch data .",
    "we have discovered eight quasars in the overlap regions @xcite .",
    "the selection procedure of overlap - region quasars is slightly different from those described above .",
    "the image quality is usually different between the repeat runs . in the first step of the selection procedure ,",
    "the magnitude limit for both ` primary ' and ` secondary ' detections is @xmath57 mag or @xmath58 mag ( @xmath59 detection ) .",
    "the candidates are actually fainter than @xmath60 detections , because otherwise they would have been selected in the main survey .",
    "we focused on high galactic latitude ( @xmath37 ) regions . using repeat observations",
    "ensures that most @xmath36-dropout objects we select are physical sources , rather than artifacts or cosmic rays . in the second step ,",
    "we take deeper @xmath36 and @xmath25 band images to improve photometry for @xmath36-dropout objects .",
    "the rest of the selection procedure remains the same .",
    "the details are given in @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the discovery of nine new quasars in the sdss .",

    "we will now derive the qlf based on the 47 quasars .",
    "in this subsection , we calculate the effective area coverage for our quasar samples .",
    "the calculation of effective area is not straightforward for several reasons , including the sdss imaging survey geometry , possible missing data , existence of very bright stars ( resulting in large ` holes ' in object catalogs ) , and so on .",
    "we estimate the effective area using the hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization ( healpix ; * ? ? ?",
    "healpix hierarchically tessellates the spherical sky into a mesh of curvilinear quadrilaterals .",
    "the base resolution , or the lowest resolution level ( we call it level 0 ) , consists of 12 pixels over the celestial sphere . the resolution level increases by dividing each pixel into 4 subpixels with identical area .",
    "at level higher than 1 , each pixel has 8 neighboring pixels , except for 24 pixels ( each of them has 7 neighboring pixels ) .",
    "the effective area of our samples is calculated by adding up the area of the pixels that cover our data points . obviously , the accuracy depends on the resolution level of the healpix pixels and the spatial density of data points .",
    "our data points are drawn from the sdss query casjobs online server .",
    "we use all sdss ` primary ' objects with @xmath103 mag and @xmath104 mag for the main survey .",
    "we only remove a tiny fraction of objects with the sdss processing flags ` bright ' , ` edge ' , and ` satur ' . for the overlap regions ,",
    "we use all ` primary ' and secondary objects down to @xmath105 mag and @xmath106 mag .",
    "the average density of the data points is about 5 objects per square arcminute .",
    "the data points for stripe 82 are drawn from our stacked images / catalogs @xcite , and the number density is much higher than that for the other two regions .    for a given dataset ,",
    "the starting resolution level is critical for area calculation .",
    "we have tried different starting resolution levels , and found that healpix level 10 ( i.e. , the healpix base resolution is divided 10 times ) is the best for the sdss .",
    "figure [ fig : coverage ] shows an example that compares the results from three different starting resolution levels , levels 9 ( top panel ) , 10 ( middle panel ) , and 11 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the added ` holes ' from level 9 to level 10 are almost all real , primarily caused by missing data and very bright stars . on the contrary , the majority of the added ` holes ' from level 10 to level 11 are not real , but represent relatively empty regions of the sky in the sdss imaging .",
    "therefore , we use healpix level 10 as our base resolution or starting resolution , which is 11.8 square arcminutes per pixel .",
    "now we classify all pixels into three categories . in the first category",
    "are the pixels that do not cover any data points , and these regions are beyond the effective coverage of our survey .",
    "the pixels in the second category ( hereafter boundary pixels ) are the close neighbors to the pixels in the first category , i.e. , each boundary pixel has at least one neighboring pixel in the first category .",
    "the boundary pixels include outer boundaries and inner boundaries ( the edges of the inner ` holes ' , see figure [ fig : coverage ] ) .",
    "the third category contains all remaining pixels ( hereafter non - boundary pixels ) .",
    "all non - boundary pixels at level 10 constitute the major part of the total effective coverage .",
    "the accuracy of area calculation is now determined by boundary pixels .",
    "we refine boundary pixels by gradually increasing the resolution level , until the resolution roughly matches the average surface density of the data points . for the main survey and overlap regions , the boundary pixels",
    "are calculated to level 13 , at which the resolution is 0.18 square arcminutes per pixel or 5.5 pixels per square arcminute , matching the density of 5 objects per square arcminute . for stripe 82 ,",
    "the boundary pixels are calculated to level 14 , at which the resolution is 0.046 square arcminutes per pixel .",

    "we found 13 quasars in stripe 82 .",
    "the spatial density is about 1 per 21 deg@xmath3 , which is much higher than the density in the main survey .",
    "we use simulations to estimate the completeness of the quasar sample .",
    "the incompleteness comes from our quasar selection criteria , i.e. , the color cuts and survey limits that we applied in section 2 .",

    "we extend the model to higher redshifts under the assumption that the shape of the quasar sed does not evolve with redshift .",
    "the only significant difference is the increasing neutral h absorption in ly@xmath10  forests towards higher redshifts .",

    "the probability decline at @xmath116 and @xmath117 is caused by the color cuts on the @xmath44 and @xmath43 colors , and the probability decline at the low luminosity end is due to the survey limit in the @xmath25 band . in the top panel , one quasar ( j1243 + 2529 discovered in this paper )",
    "has a probability below 20% .",
    "the reason is that this quasar is relatively faint with @xmath118 mag , below the nominal limit of @xmath119 mag for @xmath120 mag in the sdss .",

    "this is because the 10 quasars in the overlap regions were selected in a small magnitude range , i.e. , @xmath59 to @xmath60 detections in the sdss @xmath25-band images .",
    "the three brightest quasars in this panel are brighter than the faintest quasars in the top panel .",
    "however , they are located in regions that are much shallower than the nominal depth of the sdss single - epoch images , and thus were not selected in our main survey .    in figure",

    "observations of a large sample of @xmath0 quasars are needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , quasars with blue @xmath122 colors are well within our selection criteria , and have little impact on our sample completeness .",
    "we first derive the binned luminosity function from the three subsamples separately : the main survey sample with 24 quasars , the overlap region sample with 10 quasars , and the stripe 82 sample with 13 quasars . the main survey and stripe",

    "the best fit ( the dotted line in figure [ fig : lf ] ) to all sdss data points results in a slope of @xmath127 .",

    "the vista viking survey is able to find higher redshift quasars .",
    "it has found 3 quasars at @xmath203 , and is expecting to find nearly 20 quasars at @xmath204 in the near future @xcite .",
    "des , with imaging data slightly deeper than stripe 82 over @xmath205 deg@xmath3 , has found its first @xmath0 quasar , and has claimed that it would find 50100 quasars at @xmath180 , including 310 quasars at @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "the subaru shellq survey is producing a large number of very faint quasars using deep hyper suprime - cam imaging data @xcite .",
    "these quasars will be used to constrain the faint end of the qlf at @xmath0 .",
    "the future lsst survey @xcite will have an unprecedented power for searches of high - redshift quasars .",
    "it will eventually find thousands of quasars ( assuming that there will be enough resources for follow - up identification ) , and fully constrain the @xmath0 qlf .",
    "the above surveys are providing a golden opportunity for studying high - redshift quasars and the distant universe .",

    "<S> , we obtain the parameters for a double power - law fit to the qlf . </S>",
    "<S> the bright - end slope @xmath8 of the qlf is well constrained to be @xmath9 . due to the small number of low - luminosity quasars , the faint - end slope @xmath10 and the characteristic magnitude @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> are less well constrained , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial density of luminous quasars , parametrized as @xmath14 , drops rapidly from @xmath15 to 6 , with @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> based on our fitted qlf and assuming an igm clumping factor of @xmath17 , we find that the observed quasar population can not provide enough photons to ionize the @xmath0 igm at @xmath18% confidence . </S>",
    "<S> quasars may still provide a significant fraction of the required photons , although much larger samples of faint quasars are needed for more stringent constraints on the quasar contribution to reionization . </S>"
