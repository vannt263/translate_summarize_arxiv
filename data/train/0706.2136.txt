    "the direct production of heavy quarks would be an important background process , so a precise calculation of the heavy - quark production and fragmentation processes becomes mandatory . since the heavy - quark mass provides a natural infrared cutoff , the calculation of the cross section can , to a large extent , be performed using perturbative qcd .",
    "since the center - of - mass energy @xmath11 of modern particle colliders is much larger than the bottom- or charm - quark masses , the total inclusive heavy - quark production cross section is well approximated by neglecting the masses @xmath12 of the heavy quarks .",
