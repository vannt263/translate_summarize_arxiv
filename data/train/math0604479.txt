    "let @xmath0 be a polynomial ring over a field @xmath1 . then given a hilbert function @xmath2 it is easy to see that there can be more than one ideal @xmath3 such that the hilbert function of @xmath4 is @xmath2 .",
    "one can further distinguish such ideals by passing to a finer invariant , the graded betti numbers , which gives rise to the question : given a particular hilbert function @xmath2 , what sets of graded betti numbers actually occur ?",
    "that this problem is bounded above , and hence finite , is due to an important result by bigatti and hulett @xcite ( independently in characteristic zero ) , and pardue @xcite ( in characteristic @xmath5 ) which says that , given a hilbert function @xmath2 , the lexicographic ideal attaining @xmath2 has everywhere largest graded betti numbers . in fact , this says that the partial order on the set of sets of graded betti numbers of ideals attaining a given hilbert function has a unique maximum element .",
    "shortly thereafter , it was shown by charalambous and evans @xcite that this order need not have a unique minimal element .",
    "examples of infinite families of hilbert functions which did not support unique minimal elements were given by richert @xcite .",
    "the structure of the partial order on graded betti numbers has also been considered on interesting subsets of the set of all ideals attaining a given hilbert function .",
    "for instance , geramita , harima , and shin @xcite showed that if one restricts to the graded betti numbers arising from a certain ( dense ) set of gorenstein ideals , then the associated partial order has a unique maximal element which is constructed using a lexicographic ideal ( migliore and nagel @xcite were later able to extend this result to an even larger set of gorenstein ideals attaining a given hilbert function ) while richert @xcite showed that a unique minimal element need not exist .",
    "for stable ideals in dimension at most three , francisco @xcite showed that , unlike the general and gorenstein cases , there is always a unique smallest element .",
    "it is a result of aramova , herzog , and hibi @xcite that if one restricts to the graded betti numbers arising from squarefree monomial ideals attaining a given hilbert function , then the associated partial order has a unique maximal element ( which arises , not surprisingly , from the squarefree lexicographic ideal ) .",
    "squarefree monomial ideals are particularly interesting ( to algebraists , topologists , and combinatorists alike ) because to each squarefree monomial ideal @xmath6 in @xmath7 variables can be associated a simplicial complex @xmath8 on @xmath7 vertices , while the hilbert function of @xmath4 is related to the face counts of @xmath8 and the graded betti numbers of @xmath4 can be computed by considering sums of the ranks of the reduced homologies of subsets of @xmath8 .",
    "it was known that ( gelvin , lavictore , reed , richert @xcite ) for @xmath9 variables ( and after fixing a finite field ) , the partial orders arising from fixing a hilbert function were totally ordered , but that this failed in six variables where , in fact , there is an example of a partial order which does not have a unique smallest element . in the current paper , we continue this line of inquiry .",
    "first , we generate an infinite family ( the size of which grows exponentially with dimension ) of hilbert functions for which the partial order on the graded betti numbers corresponding to squarefree monomial ideals fails to have a unique minimal element .",
    "we are able to show that this same family of hilbert functions gives rise to partially ordered sets corresponding to all ideals ( not only squarefree monomial ideals ) which fail to have a unique minimal element .",
    "we then find an infinite family ( again , growing exponentially ) of hilbert functions for which the partial order on the betti numbers ( not graded betti numbers ) of squarefree monomial ideals fails to have a unique smallest element ( and are again able to show that this family gives posets without unique minimal elements in the case of all ideals ) .",
    "next , we find an infinite family ( growing exponentially ) of hilbert functions for which the partial order associated to the graded betti numbers of squarefree monomial ideals has a single element , and thus a unique smallest element .",
    "we note an analogous family in the general case . finally , we find a infinite family ( growing linearly ) of hilbert functions for which the partial order associated to the graded betti numbers of squarefree monomial ideals has a unique smallest element , and a nontrivial poset tree .",

    ", we will be studying the graded betti numbers of ideals with a fixed hilbert function .",

    "it is useful to display graded betti numbers in the following table known as a betti diagram ( using the notation of macaulay 2 @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the sum of the entries in the @xmath19 column .",
    "then @xmath20 is the set of betti numbers .",
    "there is an obvious partial order on the betti diagrams which arise for ideals with a given hilbert function .",

    "furthermore , @xmath28 if @xmath24 and there is a pair @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the extremal properties of this ordering .",
    "a useful definition in this regard is that of @xmath31-linearity : a minimal free resolution of an ideal @xmath6 is called @xmath31-linear if @xmath6 is minimally generated by @xmath31-forms and @xmath32 for each @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it turns out that the graded betti numbers are a finer invariant than hilbert functions .",
    "they are related by the following useful equation .",
    "@xcite given an ideal @xmath35 $ ] with graded betti numbers @xmath21 , @xmath36    it follows from this formula that the diagonal alternating sums of a betti diagram are invariant for all betti diagrams of ideals attaining a given hilbert function .",
    "we define this alternating sum as follows :    given an ideal @xmath6 , the @xmath37 diagonal alternating sum of the betti diagram of @xmath6 is : @xmath38 where the @xmath39 are the graded betti numbers of @xmath6 .",
    "the partial ordering on betti diagrams has a unique maximal betti diagram @xcite . in order to identify an ideal attaining the maximal graded betti numbers , we need the following notation : let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be monomials such that @xmath42 ( i.e. they are of the same degree ) .",
    "we say @xmath43 if and only if the first nonzero entry of @xmath44 is positive .",
    "this is known as the _ lexicographic _ or _ lex _ ordering on monomials .",
    "an ideal @xmath45 is a _ lex ideal _ if for all monomials @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 implies @xmath49 .",
    "a lex ideal achieves the maximal graded betti numbers among all ideals attaining its hilbert function .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with squarefree monomial ideals .",
    "squarefree monomial ideal _ is an ideal in @xmath50 $ ] minimally generated by elements of the form @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "we will make use of the fact that the squarefree monomial ideals are in one - to - one correspondence with simplicial complexes .",
    "recall the definition of a simplicial complex : a _ simplicial complex _",
    "@xmath53 on the vertex set @xmath54 is a collection of subsets called faces or simplices , closed under taking subsets ; that is if @xmath55 is a face and @xmath56 , then @xmath57 .",
    "a simplex @xmath55 of cardinality @xmath58 has dimension @xmath26 and is called an @xmath26-face .    the ( well known , see for instance @xcite ) procedure to pass from a simplicial complex @xmath53 to a squarefree monomial ideal is to form the ideal generated by monomials corresponding to the minimal non - faces of @xmath53 , after renaming the vertex set of @xmath53 to be @xmath59 .",
    "the simplicial complex @xmath60 corresponds to the ideal @xmath61 .",
    "we use dashed lines in the picture to indicate minimal non - faces .",
    "this correspondence gives a bijection between simplicial complexes and squarefree monomial ideals with no linear terms .",
    "in general , we will conflate simplicial complexes and ideals due to this correspondence , and so we are free to talk about the betti numbers of a simplicial complex or the homology of an ideal .    given a simplicial complex with @xmath62 @xmath26-faces , its corresponding _",

    "the @xmath63-vector counts the 4 0-faces ( or points ) , 4 1-faces ( or edges ) , 1 2-face , and 0 3-faces ( or volume ) .",
    "the @xmath63-vector is an important invariant of a simplicial complex because of the following :    @xcite let @xmath6 be the stanley - reisner ideal of a simplicial complex with @xmath63-vector @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath66    from the theorem , it follows that @xmath63-vectors and hilbert functions are in one - to - one correspondence .    given a hilbert function which arises for squarefree monomial ideals",
    ", we will be particularly interested in the corresponding squarefree lex ideal ( because it always exists and is known to exhibit the maximal betti diagram @xcite ) .",
