    "this can be explained as due to the elongated shape of cores in numerical simulations , consistent with typical aspect ratios in observed cores ( myers et al .",
    "1991 ) , and to density structures along the line of sight to a core and within the core ( lines of sight perpendicular to the elongated structure have more weight in determining the value of @xmath43 ) .    observed column densities almost always overestimate the core s true opacity to uv photons ( especially at the largest values of ) , since these always penetrate preferentially along directions of lowest column density ( for example the core shortest axis ) .",
