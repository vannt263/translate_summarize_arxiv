    "the construction of theoretical models describing relativistic stars and the phenomenon of gravitational collapse is a fundamental issue in relativistic astrophysics .",
    "pioneering work was done by schwarzschild  @xcite , who analyzed solutions describing a star of uniform energy density ; tolman provided explicit solutions of static fluid spheres  @xcite ; oppenheimer and volkoff  @xcite , by considering specific tolman solutions , analyzed the gravitational equilibrium of stellar structures ; oppenheimer and snyder  @xcite , provided the first insights to gravitational collapse into a black hole ; buchdahl  @xcite and bondi  @xcite also generalized the interior constant energy density solutions to more general static fluid spheres in the form of inequalities involving the energy density , central pressure and the location of the boundary matching surface .",
    "these authors , amongst others , lay down the foundations of the general relativistic theory of stellar structures ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review ) .    in the 1970 s , florides in an attempt to understand , within the framework of general relativity , why a spherically symmetric distribution of pressure - less dust at rest can not maintain itself in equilibrium , discovered a new interior uniform density ( schwarzschild - like ) solution .",
    "the latter solution is static , spherically symmetric , regular throughout the interior , and is matched to an exterior schwarzschild spacetime  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the radial pressure is identically zero and the tangential pressure is positive and an increasing function of the radial coordinate .",
    "now , at a first glance the absence of a radial pressure may cast doubts upon the physical significance of the florides solution , as one is accustomed to thinking that it is precisely this radial pressure that maintains a system in static equilibrium .",
    "however , it was found to have a rather elegant physical interpretation , namely , the florides interior solution describes the interior field of an einstein cluster  @xcite ( the florides solution was further analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . recall that the einstein cluster describes a static and spherically symmetric gravitational field of a large number of particles moving in randomly oriented concentric circular orbits under their own gravitational field .",
    "whilst analyzing the florides solution within itself , and considering the whole permitted range of the radial coordinate , without the respective matching to an exterior schwarzschild spacetime at a junction interface , we came across an extremely interesting feature , namely , that the solution in fact represents a three - sphere , possessing a singular equatorial two - sphere , in the sense that the curvature invariants and the tangential pressure diverge .",
    "this interesting aspect of the geometry motivated a more careful analysis of the florides solution , as these two - sphere singularities have not been investigated before , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , by dropping the assumption of homogeneity on a cosmological scale , the authors considered a static and spherically symmetric model , containing a singularity which continually interacts with the universe .",
    "it was suggested that the singularity can be interpreted as a sphere surrounding a regular central region .",
    "but , it is important to emphasize that the latter singularity is fundamentally different in nature to the two - sphere singularity analyzed in this work , as shall be discussed below in more detail .",
    "we also stress that spacetime singularities have played a fundamental role in conceptual discussions of general relativity , and a key aspect of singularities in general relativity is whether they are a disaster for the theory , as they imply the breakdown of predictability .",
    "one may mention several attitudes that are widespread in the literature  @xcite , namely , that singularities are mere artifacts of unrealistic and idealized models ; general relativity entails singularities , but fails to accurately describe nature ; and the existence of singularities may be viewed as a source to probe the limitations of general relativity , and from which one may derive a valuable understanding of cosmology  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the latter viewpoint throughout this work , attempting to understand the nature of the two - sphere singularity present in the florides solution .",
    "this paper is outlined in the following manner : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we deduce the general radial pressure - less solution , and further consider the specific case of constant energy density , with and without a cosmological constant , and provide the geometrical interpretation of the singular two - sphere . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we analyze specific characteristics of the geometry , such as the conserved quantities and geodesic motion .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:4 ] , we conclude .",
    "consider a static and spherically symmetric spacetime , given in curvature coordinates , by the following line element @xmath0 where @xmath1 . as we are interested in analyzing solutions with a vanishing radial pressure , i ..",
    "e , @xmath2 , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , the anisotropic stress energy tensor is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the projection of the metric along the transverse spatial direction , i.e. , orthogonal to the radial direction .",
    "it is defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the four - velocity , and @xmath7 is the unit spacelike vector in the radial direction , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the energy density , and @xmath13 is the transverse pressure measured in the orthogonal direction to @xmath7 .    using the einstein field equation , @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the stress energy tensor components are given by @xmath16 \\label{pt}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "integration of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) yields the following relationship @xmath18 where the integration constant has been evaluated by considering @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath20 is the quasi - local mass , and is denoted as the mass function . substituting eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) , we have @xmath21 where the constant of integration may be determined by matching this interior solution to a schwarzschild exterior solution at a junction interface , @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the constant is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the object s mass , with @xmath25 .",
    "with these relationships the tangential pressure is given by @xmath26 the latter relationship may also be obtained from the conservation of the stress energy tensor , @xmath27 , which provides the anisotropic form of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "the metric finally assumes the form @xmath28\\,dt^2 + \\frac{dr^2}{1 - 2m(r)/r}+r^2\\,d\\omega^2 \\ , .",
    "\\label{generalmetric2}\\ ] ]      considering a constant energy density  @xcite , the mass function , given by eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) , and eq .  ( [ alpha ] ) are readily integrated .",
    "this provides metric ( [ generalmetric2 ] ) in the following simplified form @xmath29 and corresponds to the following stress energy tensor @xmath30 where @xmath22 is the matching surface , and the time was scaled to match with the schwarzschild exterior .",
    "we immediately verify some problems with the above stress energy tensor components in comparison with the usual schwarzschild interior solution . in the case of an isotropic constant density perfect fluid , the field equations yield a closed system of equations that can be solved uniquely for any given central pressure by means of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "the resulting pressure function turns out to be monotonically decreasing and its vanishing uniquely defines the boundary of the stellar object at which the schwarzschild exterior metric can be matched .",
    "looking at the above tangential pressure component , given by eq .",
    "( [ stresses ] ) , we realize that the pressure is monotonically increasing , and in fact diverges as @xmath31 .",
    "hence , in contrast to the schwarzschild interior solution , there is no ` preferred ' vanishing pressure surface that is implied by the field equations .",
    "thus one may match this interior solution at any value @xmath32 to an exterior schwarzschild spacetime and thereby avoiding the discussion of the singularity at @xmath33 .",
    "this feature of the solution motivates the geometrical analysis of the global spacetime described by metric  ( [ metric1 ] ) .",
    "florides and later authors certainly noticed the divergent tangential pressure but presumably avoided its discussion by requiring that the schwarzschild metric is matched at some smaller radius .    the chosen coordinate system for metric  ( [ metric1 ] ) is defined for radii that satisfy @xmath34 .",
    "it is however easy to introduce a coordinate system that yields a much better geometrical understanding .",
    "therefore , let us introduce a third angle @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 for which the metric  ( [ metric1 ] ) becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the metric coefficient @xmath39 can be rescaled to have @xmath40 , which leads to the form of the metric that will be used henceforth @xmath41 in performing a more careful analysis of the florides solution we come across an extremely interesting aspect , namely , that the solution in fact represents a three - sphere , possessing a singular equatorial two - sphere . before analyzing the geometry of the spacetime in more detail",
    ", we shall briefly consider the inclusion of a cosmological constant .",
    "chongming _ et al _  @xcite extended the original work of florides by taking into account the cosmological constant .",
    "this generalization yields the following metric and stress energy tensor , given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spatial geometry now depends on the cosmological constant , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "let us introduce a new parameter @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 for @xmath46 the spatial geometry corresponds to a space of constant positive curvature , i.e. , a sphere ; for @xmath47 the geometry is euclidean ; and for @xmath48 the spatial geometry has constant negative curvature and is therefore hyperbolic .",
    "it is then also useful to introduce , similar to the third angle in the spherical case , adapted coordinates for the hyperbolic case .",
    "hence , define @xmath49 so that for the specific case of @xmath48 , metric  ( [ eq : x1 ] ) takes the form @xmath50 similarly , the stress energy tensor components simplify in the new coordinates to the following relationships @xmath51 in contrast to the spherical case , the tangential pressure does not diverge in the hyperbolic case since @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , the center @xmath53 is regular ( even flat ) and therfore this hyperbolic spacetime is a globally regular spacetime , completely filled with an anisotropic perfect fluid , having constant energy density and vanishing radial pressure .",
    "moreover , the schwarzschild - anti de sitter spacetime can be matched at any @xmath54 hypersurface so that the induced metric and the extrinsic curvature with respect to the matching surface are both continuous .",
    "for the specific euclidean case , where @xmath47 , one has to be careful by appropriately taking the limit in metric  ( [ eq : x1 ] ) because of the exponent .",
    "for consistency of the notation , let us rename @xmath17 by @xmath35 , so that the metric reads @xmath55 having the stress energy tensor components @xmath56    it should also be noted that the stress energy tensor  ( [ eq : x2 ] ) implies that for @xmath57 , the tangential pressure also vanishes . in this case",
    "the stress energy tensor reduces to pressure - less dust , @xmath58 . since the @xmath44 is also positive , the spatial geometry is spherical and hence this spacetime is the original einstein static universe ( pressure - less ) that was suggested by einstein in 1917 .",
    "however , the spherical case with non - vanishing tangential pressure does not allow the construction of an anisotropic einstein static universe with vanishing radial pressure .",
    "it should be noted that the einstein static universe can be generalized to have non - constant pressure with two regular centers , see  @xcite , and also in spacetimes with torsion an analog einstein universe can be constructed , containing a constant radially symmetric torsion field  @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore that the anisotropic einstein static universe is much more difficult to construct and it may possibly require a non - constant energy density",
    ". a similar question has not been answered yet ( as far as we know ) , namely if a charged einstein universe can in principle be constructed that also is globally regular .",
    "another interesting feature of an anisotropic matter distribution is their recent appearance in a rather different context of gravastars and dark energy stars ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . for a constant energy density ,",
    "the metric reported in  @xcite takes the form @xmath59 where , as above , one can easily introduce a new coordinate ( third angle ) by @xmath60 .",
    "one should note that @xmath61 , the dark energy equation of state parameter , and @xmath62 can both be chosen so that this metric agrees with either the florides metric  ( [ metric1 ] ) , where simply @xmath63 , or its generalization due to the presence of @xmath64 , eq .  ( [ eq : x1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that to be a gravastar ( or a dark energy star ) solution a fundamental ingredient is a repulsive interior spacetime .",
    "this differs from the florides solution , as in the latter the interior geometry is attractive .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the nature of the singularity in metric ( [ eq : m4 ] ) , for the spherically symmetric case with @xmath65 , although the main results that follow are unchanged for @xmath46 . for that , let us compute the non - vanishing riemann tensor components @xmath66 and weyl tensor components @xmath67 respectively",
    ". since these weyl tensor components are non - vanishing , we note crucial geometrical differences between the interior schwarzschild solution and the florides solution .",
    "it is well - known that the schwarzschild interior solution is conformally flat  @xcite , irrespective of the cosmological constant  @xcite .    these yield the squared riemann and weyl tensors , and we also note the square of the ricci tensor @xmath68 respectively .",
    "all three geometrical invariants diverge near @xmath69 in a similar way , by which we mean @xmath70 namely , the weyl tensor is not dominated by the ricci tensor  @xcite and the singularity does not correspond to an isotropic singularity .",
    "the ricci scalar is given by @xmath71 which also diverges at @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a singularity is not point - like .",
    "it describes a singular two - sphere , but the spacetime is well defined for @xmath72 . since the spatial part of this spacetime is a three - sphere we find the following geometrical picture : a three - sphere whose equatorial two - sphere is singular in the sense that the above invariants and the tangential pressure diverge",
    ". however , the radial pressure ( identically zero ) and the energy density are both finite at the singularity .",
    "[ figa ] represents the spatial three - sphere @xmath73 .",
    "+    it should be noted however , that the metric  ( [ eq : m4 ] ) is actually well defined for @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , we could in principle draw a second copy of the three - sphere so that the two half three - spheres are joined at @xmath53 rather than at the equator .",
    "however , we can still identify both singular two - spheres and would obtain something like fig .",
    "[ figb ] .",
    "+    the florides solution can be interpreted as the interior of an einstein cluster , therefore the singularity could also be interpreted from that point of view .",
    "we have a large number of particles that move in oriented circular orbits .",
    "their individual velocities and angular momenta  @xcite are related to the tangential pressure and therefore the singular two - sphere corresponds to the surface where the particles all move with the speed of light .",
    "obviously , such a surface has singular properties and it is expected that the proper time of the geodesics is zero , which is shown explicitly in the next section . furthermore our analysis seems to be important also in the context of rotating magnetized stellar objects .",
    "there exists a similar phenomena with respect to the rotating magnetic field lines . at large distances from the surface of the stellar object",
    "these line would rotate with the speed of light .",
    "a more detailed study comparing the geometry of the rotating magnetic field lines with the analytically simple florides solution might shed some new light to the theory of magnetized stellar objects .    as referred to in the introduction , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed a static and spherically symmetric model of the universe , containing a singularity which can be viewed as a sphere surrounding a central region @xmath75 , at @xmath76 .",
    "the solution possesses two centers , one at @xmath76 and the second at @xmath77 , as the surface area of the two - spheres of symmetry tends to zero at both centers .",
    "all past radial null geodesics intersect the singularity , as do all spacelike radial geodesics .",
    "thus , the singularity can be interpreted as surrounding the central region @xmath75 , and lies within a finite distance from @xmath75 , so that the universe is spatially finite and bounded .",
    "note that traversing a radial null geodesic from the singularity , one reaches the central region after a distance @xmath78 , and the singularity is attained again after traveling a total distance of @xmath79 .",
    "the spacetime can be thought of as being spherically symmetric about both @xmath75 and the singular center ( we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "note that the nature of this singularity is fundamentally different to the two - sphere singularity in the florides solution .",
    "first , in ref .  @xcite the stress energy tensor components tend to zero as the singularity is attained at @xmath80 , while in the florides solution the tangential pressure diverges .",
    "second , the geometric structure is different , as the surface area of the florides two - sphere is monotonically increasing , contrary to the case analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the surface area is zero at @xmath76 and at the singularity @xmath77 .",
    "thirdly , the cases analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite impose @xmath81 at @xmath80 ( although the case @xmath82 is briefly hinted at , it is not analyzed ) , while in the florides solution we have @xmath82 as @xmath80 .",
    "throughout this section , we shall consider metric ( [ eq : m4 ] ) . consider the following lagrangian @xmath83 if the metric tensor does not depend on a determined coordinate , @xmath84 , through the euler - lagrange equations one obtains that the quantity @xmath85 is constant along any geodesic . applied to line element  ( [ eq : m4 ] ) , one verifies that the metric tensor components are independent of the coordinates @xmath86 and @xmath87 , so that the conserved quantities are given by @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 may be interpreted as the energy and angular momentum per unit mass . without a loss of generality we may consider the equatorial plane with @xmath91 .",
    "the line element ( [ eq : m4 ] ) may be rewritten in terms of the constants defined above , for the particular case of @xmath91 , in the following manner @xmath92 where @xmath93 is defined for null geodesics , and @xmath94 for timelike geodesics .",
    "the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are determined by the initial conditions of the movement .",
    "for instance , consider a fixed observer along a point on the geodesic .",
    "the velocity of a test geodesic particle ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , as measured by the observer is given by @xmath95 and substituting eq .",
    "( [ p])-([line2 ] ) , we have @xmath96 for timelike geodesics , @xmath97 . if a body initiates its movement at @xmath53 ( @xmath76 ) with @xmath98 , then @xmath99 .",
    "note that at @xmath69 ( @xmath77 ) , we have @xmath100 .",
    "indeed , the range of @xmath89 is precisely @xmath101 , as shall also be shown below",
    ".        consider null geodesics along the @xmath102direction ( @xmath103direction ) , i.e. , with @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 .",
    "integrating the latter provides the following solution @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the elliptic function of the second kind , defined as @xmath108    consider the specific case of circular orbits , i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath109 , so that the line element reduces to @xmath110 the null geodesic , @xmath111 , provides @xmath112 , which has the following solution @xmath113 note an interesting feature of this spacetime , namely , the time coordinate tends to zero as @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , for null circular geodesics .",
    "indeed , the time coordinate increases from @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , and decreases from @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",

    "consider the specific case of @xmath91 and @xmath125 , which implies @xmath126 .",
    "thus , we have to solve the following differential equation @xmath127 note the restriction @xmath128 . integrating the latter differential equation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the elliptic function of the fist kind @xmath131    for the case of @xmath132 , we have @xmath133 using the relationship @xmath134 , the latter provides the following solution @xmath135 which reduces to eq .",
    "( [ staticobserv ] ) if @xmath126 .",
    "note that one may also find a relationship for the proper time measured by an observer traversing a circumference at @xmath132 , in terms of @xmath89 , given by @xmath136",
    "in this work we took a fresh look at the florides solution , which represents an interior static and spherically symmetric perfect fluid spacetime with vanishing radial stresses . in the standard approach to its physical interpretation ,",
    "the schwarzschild vacuum spacetime is matched at some constant radius hypersurface .",
    "however , we were interested in the complete geometry of the matter and therefore analyzed the geometry throughout the permitted range of the radial coordinate without requiring the matching to an exterior schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the resulting geometry is particularly interesting since it admits a two - sphere singularity which itself is the equator of a higher dimensional three - sphere .",
    "this is quite contrary to the usual scenario where the singularities are point - like .",
    "the constant density florides solution has an elegant interpretation as the field inside an einstein cluster which is generated by particles moving in concentric circular orbits around the center . in view of this picture",
    "the singular two - sphere can be interpreted as the surface where all the particles are moving with the speed of light , and consequently our spacetime picture breaks down as particles ` behind ' the singularity would move faster than the speed of light .    in conclusion , we emphasize that spacetime singularities have played a fundamental role in conceptual discussions of general relativity .",
