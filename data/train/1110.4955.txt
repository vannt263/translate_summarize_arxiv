    "biological filaments of the cytoskeleton are large macromolecules formed by a hierarchical self - assembly of smaller yet often highly complex protein subunits",
    ". the monomer complexity can allow the subunits to undergo rearrangements between several conformational states .",
    "once inserted into a macromolecular lattice these individual subunits can start to interact giving rise to cooperative phenomena which can affect equilibrium and dynamical properties of the whole assembly in unexpected manners .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to explore in detail the statistical mechanics of this type of cooperatively switching supramolecular assemblies , whose paradigm example might be found in the stiffest cytoskeletal protein filaments of eukaryotic cells , the microtubules @xcite .",
    "microtubules are hollow nanotubes whose walls are formed by lateral self - association of parallel protofilaments that themselves are built by a head - to - tail polymerization of @xmath0-tubulin heterodimer protein subunits .",
    "this very complex architecture confers to microtubules their high stiffness as well as a number of unique static and dynamic properties . in @xcite , guided by experimental findings",
    ", we built the case for a novel model of microtubules , based on two hypotheses : the elementary tubulin dimer units can fluctuate between a curved and a straight configuration and can interact cooperatively along a protofilament axis .",
    "this implies that the ground state of microtubules is not , as usually accepted a straight euler beam , but instead a fluctuating several micron sized cooperative super - helix .",
    "the resulting polymorphic dynamics of the microtubule lattice seems to quantitatively explain several experimental puzzles including anomalous scaling of dynamic fluctuations of grafted microtubules @xcite , their apparent length - stiffness relation @xcite and their remarkably curved - helical appearance in general @xcite .",
    "these results rely on phenomenological modelling where the cylindrical symmetry of the microtubule lattice is approximated by a continuous symmetry @xcite .",
    "this approximation seems reasonable as the number of protofilaments is typically large , ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 for taxol stabilized in - vitro microtubules with a predominant @xmath3 protofilament structure @xcite . in vivo , microtubules most commonly appear with @xmath4 protofilaments@xcite , although many exceptions exist depending of the cell type .",
    "the approach developed in @xcite revealed the existence of a unique and unusual zero mode dynamics which has strong consequences : microtubules are permanently coherently reshaping -i.e . changing their reference ground state configuration- by thermal fluctuations .",
    "going beyond the continuous phenomenological approach of @xcite , we explore here other important aspects of the polymorphic microtubules theory by considering a simplified minimal solvable model .",
    "we will adopt a coarse - grained approach where the microtubule lattice is considered as made up of only @xmath5 blocks of protofilaments that can fluctuate between a curved and a straight configuration .",
    "although the coarse - grained model to some extent loses the ( quasi)continuous zero mode dynamics , it captures a number of important features of the full model @xcite and exact analytic computations of relevant observables becomes accessible in this simpler case .",
    "in particular the tubulin - tubulin state correlation function , the persistence length , the thermodynamic stability of conformational states as well as the tangent angle spectrum can be computed rather elegantly .",
    "this simplified approach should give more detailed analytical insights into microtubule s static properties and make connection with the previous phenomenological model s parameters introduced in @xcite .",
    "while it is not our prime goal here to compare the developed toy model with experiments we hope that some of the derived results ( like the tangent angle power spectrum ) can become useful guides for future experimental quantification of polymorphic filament fluctuations . for a more detailed experiment - theory comparison and deeper motivation of the model",

    "1 ) is modelled as a continuum tube material made of a variable number of protofilaments with @xmath6 @xmath7 - the inner and outer microtubule radii respectively .",

    "we introduce two reference frames ( cf . fig .",

    "for instance the `` all - straight '' or `` all - curved '' protofilament state correspond both to the same value @xmath34 , cf .",
    "fig . 1d ( as the curved state distribution is isotropic in both special cases ) .",
    "a second ( scalar ) quantity @xmath35 counts the total number of blocks in the curved state at each cross - section @xmath24 . the tubulin cooperativity _ along _ each protofilament ( block ) axis is modelled by an ising type nearest - neighbor cooperative interaction with an interaction energy @xmath36 favoring longitudinal nearest neighbors to be in the same state .",
    "the interaction energy at cross - section @xmath24 reads : @xmath37 the total elastic +  polymorphic energy can then be written as @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the combined elastic energy and the energy resulting from the switching of tubulin dimers at i - th cross - section:@xmath40   \\label{e}\\ ] ] with the elastic bending modulus @xmath41 and @xmath42 the young modulus . the effective lattice curvature @xmath43 results directly from the preferred curvature of the individual protofilament @xmath44 @xcite . here",

    "[ e ] we introduced an important dimensionless parameter @xmath49 which measures the competition between block switching and elastic energy and ultimately determines the microtubule shape .",

    "in the general case ( with large number of blocks ) this appears to be a formidable task , that however can be exactly performed in the case of @xmath5 blocks as we will see in the following .",
    "we first note that , at each cross - section @xmath69 decomposes into a sum over mutually facing blocks i.e. only blocks 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 couple directly .",
    "consequently the partition function can be factorized into a product of two simpler ones @xmath70 with @xmath71 the partition function of the ising variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the blocks that face each other , cf .",

    "therefore the order parameter that characterizes the typical curvature of the lattice is the mean `` polarization '' @xmath91 of the curved states ( as @xmath92 ) .",
    "the other important quantity is @xmath93 - the mean concentration of curved states , or in the ising terminology the mean `` magnetization '' ( up to a trivial additive constant ) . within the same terminology the parameter @xmath94 takes the role of a `` magnetic field '' that , according to its sign , favors one or the other possible spin orientation ( curved or straight block ) -but the same orientation for blocks on both sides of the ladder in fig .",
    "1e . the `` ferromagnetic coupling constant '' @xmath95 promotes the longitudinal parallel alignments of spins along a given block axis .",

    "@xmath306 the spectrum has a semiflexible like behavior @xmath307 reflecting the incoherence of the helix at this scale , with the persistence length given by eq .",
    "[ lpinfinit ] . for short wavelength modes",
    "@xmath308 the behavior becomes quarticaly decreasing @xmath309 and polymorphic fluctuations are strongly damped at short distance in agreement with high cooperativity at this scale .",
    "quantitative comparison with experiments at this point seems difficult , because fourier analysis of microtubules in - vitro was mainly performed on microtubules strongly confined into an almost 2-d geometry .",
    "this experimental necessity ( originating from optical microscopy sample flatness requirements ) is expected to induce artifacts as in this case , within our helical model , the microtubules would likely not fully equilibrate between their different equivalent curved states as large barriers will appear under confinement . in agreement with this argument",
    "the experimental fourier modes of microtubules systematically reveal some type of `` frozen - in '' curvature which is much larger than the fluctuations around it @xcite - in particular for longer wavelength modes .",
    "this is in so far striking as no clear argument for large systematic built - in curvature in microtubules ( other than the here described ) is evident , indicating that this curvature is in fact the very character of the microtubule elasticity .",
    "similarly in vivo , it was found that growing microtubules have large scale frozen - in curvature @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was interpreted in terms of a random interaction of the growing microtubule tip with the surrounding cytoskeleton .",
    "instead it could be that the curvature has an intrinsic origin ( like in the present model ) but is not allowed to fully equilibrate due to constraints present in the cytoplasm .",
    "we have investigated the thermodynamics of a toy model for cooperatively switching ( polymorphic ) biofilaments , whose paradigm example is believed to be the microtubule . the polymorphism of the microtubule s subunits and the short range cooperative interaction leads to properties that are very different from usual biofilaments . in particular",
    "the ground state itself is  not a single fixed shape but is found to consist of a set of degenerate helicoidal configurations . at finite temperature , the fluctuations of the subunits create defects that smoothen the perfect helix and can even destroy it on very long scale where the filament retrieves a typical worm - like chain behavior .",
    "another peculiar characteristic of the polymorphic tube is the length dependence of the persistence length .",
    "the fourier spectrum turns out also to be markedly different from classical biofilaments .",
    "while it has a typical semiflexible chain behavior at long scale the fourier modes amplitude are enhanced for modes around the characteristic scale of the helix . at",
    "very short scales the modes are strongly dampened due to the strong cooperative dimer interaction .",
    "we believe that the fourier spectrum will be of some value to discriminate between different models in the analysis of future experiments ( as in @xcite ) where confinement is absent and microtubules can thus rearrange and equilibrate .    the model developed here was inspired and tailored to microtubules .",
    "however it can be adapted to other polymorphic filaments with similar cross - sectional symmetry ( circular rod or tube ) .",
    "polymorphic sheets , rods and tubes are not uncommon in nature with the best documented example the bacterial flagellum @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the polymorphic states are likely very rigid ( or coherent in our terminology ) on thermal energy scales with correlation lengths @xmath119 larger than filament s length @xmath252 . rearrangements between equivalent lattice states could then face high barriers in the flagellum and suppress the here described polymorphic fluctuations on measurement time scales .",
    "however other filaments might be even better candidates for soft polymorphic tubes ( or rods ) and deserve a closer investigation .",
    "observations of unusual flaring - up of peculiar helical modes in bacterial pili ( cf . fig . 1 in @xcite ) as well as in actin filaments cooperatively interacting with drugs like cofilin ( cf . fig .",
    "1c in @xcite ) visually suggest the presence of soft polymorphic mode dynamics .",
