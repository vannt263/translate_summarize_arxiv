    "after the discovery of a new boson with a mass around 125 gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , there have been numerous studies attempting to pin down its properties , namely , its spin - parity and its couplings to standard model ( sm ) particles  @xcite .",
    "the bosonic decay modes of this particle have been analyzed with greater precision than the fermionic modes by both the atlas and cms collaborations , since the latter requires much more statistics and possibly the application of new search strategies .",
    "the signal - strengths reported in various channels by the experiments are broadly consistent with the sm predictions within about two standard deviations , and a preliminary analysis of spin - parity using the @xmath1 channel suggests that a cp - even scalar hypothesis is favoured over other alternatives  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the accumulating evidence is in favour of an sm - like ( @xmath2 ) higgs boson , and we are going to assume so henceforth .",
    "global fits of the higgs data have been used by both experimentalists and theorists to derive bounds on possible deviations from the sm .",
    "such deviations in the higgs couplings can be parametrized either by including a multiplicative ( or additive ) constant to the sm coupling , or by including new lorentz structures not present in the renormalizable sm lagrangian . in the framework of the sm as an effective field theory valid below a cut - off scale @xmath3 , higher - dimensional operators involving the sm fields and invariant under the sm gauge group",
    "can be used to capture possible new physics effects .",
    "a complete list of such operators has been written down in ref .",
    "@xcite , while a minimal basis has been obtained rather recently in ref .",
    "such an approach is valid as long as there is no new light degree of freedom coupled to the sm sector below the scale @xmath3 .",
    "null results in lhc searches for new particles provide some motivation for this approach , although the presence of new particles charged under the sm gauge group is still viable even with masses around the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "henceforth , we assume that there is no such new state , and work with the sm lagrangian supplemented with dimension-6 operators involving sm gauge bosons and the sm higgs doublet . as is well - known , although there exists one possible dimension-5 operator , it plays a role only in the generation of neutrino masses .",
    "electroweak precision measurements constrain the overall strength of the operators involving sm electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "however , such constraints come from one - loop contributions of these operators to the self - energy diagrams of the gauge - bosons , parametrized in terms of the so - called oblique corrections  @xcite . in contrast , the higgs boson couplings to w , z or photon pairs can be affected at the tree level itself by a class of such operators , and therefore , it is possible to impose stronger constraints on their co - efficients using the already accumulated lhc higgs data .",
    "this fact has been observed in several studies performing global fits to the higgs data , and deriving limits on the operator co - efficients  @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases , these studies make an important assumption , namely , that the efficiencies of experimental cuts used for various final states are the same as the corresponding efficiencies in the sm case . to understand where the efficiency of experimental cuts enter the global fits ,",
    "let us recall that the global fits are performed by comparing the experimentally observed signal strength ( @xmath4 ) in a channel @xmath5 with the corresponding signal strength predicted by a particular framework beyond the standard model ( bsm ) , @xmath6 , which is defined as @xmath7_{\\rm bsm}}{\\left[\\sigma(pp \\rightarrow h)\\times { \\rm br } ( h \\rightarrow x \\bar{x } ) \\times \\epsilon_{x \\bar{x}}\\right]_{\\rm sm } } , \\label{mu}\\ ] ] where , @xmath8 denotes the efficiency of the experimental cuts applied to select a particular final state .",
    "although the assumption that @xmath9 can be justified if the higgs couplings only receive a multiplicative modification to the sm one , it is not _ a priori _ clear whether such an assumption holds after the inclusion of dimension-6 operators .",
    "this is because these operators bring in new lorentz structures to the higgs - gauge boson couplings , which in turn modify the distributions of kinematic variables on which these cuts are imposed .",
    "some of these distributions have been used in earlier studies , with special emphasis on the spin - parity determination of the newly discovered particle  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we assume @xmath2 for this particle , and investigate how additional interaction terms with gauge boson pairs , gauge invariant and of higher dimension , affect higgs phenomenology .",
    "with this in view , we subject the contributions of the additional operators to the cuts used on specific final states . thus we demonstrate through rigorous monte carlo simulations how much the efficiencies can get modified , and to what extent they alter the bounds on the operator co - efficients .",
    "we use lhc higgs search studies in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels as examples , implement the cuts used by the atlas collaboration in our toy detector simulation , and determine the modified efficiencies for two such dimension-6 operators channel , we refer the readers to ref .  @xcite . ] .",
    "we also simultaneously allow the modification of the sm coupling to the weak gauge bosons by a multiplicative constant , keeping the custodial @xmath12 symmetry intact .",
    "it should be mentioned that generically more than one higher - dimensional operator can be present in the effective low - energy theory with different coupling strengths . in that sense ,",
    "our study with one operator considered at a time is illustrative , and focuses on the important effect of new lorentz structures in the cut efficiencies .",
    "moreover , the method developed here is of general utility in studying all possible higher - dimensional operators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec-2 ] , we describe the higher dimensional operators considered , the modified higgs - gauge boson couplings that they lead to , and constraints on them from electroweak precision tests . in section  [ sec-3 ] , we describe the set - up of our monte - carlo simulation , including its validation against the atlas higgs search studies in the @xmath10 channel .",
    "the modified decay widths , cross - sections and efficiencies are presented in section  [ sec-4 ] , including simple parametrizations of each of these .",
    "section  [ sec-5 ] is devoted to the re - evaluation of constraints on these operators using a fit to the higgs data in bosonic channels , while in section  [ sec-6 ] we study the modified efficiencies in the associated production of higgs . in section  [ sec-7 ]",
    "we show the modifications to certain kinematic observables in presence of the new operators .",
    "we summarize our findings in section  [ sec-8 ] .",
    "to illustrate the modification of experimental cut - efficiencies on including new lorentz structures in higgs - gauge boson interactions ( henceforth called @xmath13 interactions ) we take the following dimension-6 operators as examples : @xmath14 where , the field strength tensors for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 gauge groups are @xmath17 here , @xmath18 denotes the sm higgs doublet , @xmath19 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the @xmath15 , @xmath16 gauge couplings respectively . as mentioned in the introduction , the sm @xmath22 and @xmath23 couplings can also get modified by a multiplicative factor in a general setting , where , for example , the sm higgs doublet is part of a larger scalar sector .",
    "we therefore include the possibility of having the @xmath22 and @xmath23 couplings modified by the same factor @xmath24 , assuming custodial invariance . since generically , in presence of an arbitrary number of extra scalar singlets or doublets , @xmath25  @xcite , we scan the range @xmath26 in our analysis .",
    "one of the goals of this study is to determine to what extent @xmath24 can be different from its sm value of @xmath27 , while including new dimension-6 operators . taking these two modifications into account ,",
    "the lagrangian in the higgs sector becomes    @xmath28    where , the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by equation  [ ops ] , and the @xmath24 dependence of the sm part comes from the following terms @xmath31 here , @xmath32 denotes the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , and @xmath33 denotes the higgs boson .",
    "the higgs couplings in @xmath34 to fermions and gluons are not modified .    since the new higgs couplings generated by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in particular the new lorentz structures , are crucial to our discussion , we note down the additional @xmath13 interactions generated by the operators in equation  [ ops ]  @xcite : @xmath35 where , @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , and , @xmath38 we have used the shorthand @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the weinberg angle . the interaction terms involving the derivatives of the gauge fields bring in momentum dependent vertices , which are responsible for the modified kinematics in higgs boson production via weak - boson fusion and associated production with a @xmath42 or a @xmath43 , as well as the decay of the higgs particle to electroweak gauge boson final states .",
    "the kinematics is affected most when the new interactions appear in both the production and decay processes , an example of which we shall discuss in sections  [ sec-3 ] and [ sec-4 ] .",
    "we should remark here that in @xmath44 , only the new tree - level terms generated due to @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been considered .",
    "there will be additional contributions coming from the @xmath42 boson loop ( apart from the sm contribution modified by the inclusion of @xmath24 , which we take into account ) , since now the @xmath22 coupling also involves momentum - dependent terms .",
    "however , on naive power - counting in the number of loops and derivatives , these contributions are sub - leading , and the new divergences arising from this loop diagram will be cancelled by the next higher - order terms in the derivative expansion . with the current level of precision in the data , such terms can be safely neglected . finally , though we have noted the new contribution to the @xmath45 vertex for completeness , there is no data in this channel so far , and therefore , the effect of the modification to this channel is sub - dominant .",
    "the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 contribute to the so - called peskin - takeuchi @xmath46 parameters  @xcite , and are therefore constrained by electroweak precision data  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the bounds at @xmath47 c.l . , taking one operator at a time , are given by @xmath48 these bounds can change once we include the factor @xmath24 in equation  [ sm - beta ] . however , as we shall see , the higgs data puts much stronger constraints on these two operators compared to the precision data , and therefore , we do not consider modifications to the precision constraints in this study .",
    "we note in passing that since the inclusion of the higher - dimensional operators in equation  [ lag ] modifies the @xmath22 and @xmath23 vertices from their corresponding sm values , this will spoil the unitarity of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) scattering amplitudes at high energies . for the values of operator coefficients allowed by the current higgs data , the violation of unitarity appears at energies of a few tev , with the exact value depending upon the specific choice of operators  @xcite . since the higher - dimensional operators themselves arise from integrating out heavy fields of mass @xmath51 ( for weakly coupled ultra - violet completions )",
    ", one expects in general that the presence of these new degrees of freedom in the uv completion will eventually restore the unitarity of the full theory at high energies .",
    "as noted in the previous section , we expect in general significant modifications to the kinematics in processes where the new lorentz structures appear both in the production and decay vertices .",
    "an example of such a process is the production of higgs boson via vbf and its subsequent decay to @xmath10 . the atlas collaboration has presented a detailed analysis of such a scenario in the @xmath53 channel ( @xmath54 ) in ref .  @xcite using the @xmath55 tev , @xmath56 data . the response of sm - type interactions to all the individual cuts can be readily checked from this analysis , which thus provides a much needed calibration for the simulation with additional operators .",
    "therefore , we use this channel to set - up and validate our monte carlo as well as our detector simulation code .    we have used feynrules  @xcite to extract the feynman rules from the lagrangian in equation  [ lag ] , madgraph-5  @xcite to generate the parton level events , pythia-6  @xcite for parton shower and hadronization , and our own detector simulation code for analyzing the hadron - level events .",
    "jet formation and underlying events have been simulated within the pythia framework .",
    ".__comparison of the efficiencies of experimental cuts on the signal cross - section in the @xmath57 channel , for the @xmath58 category , demanding different flavour leptons ( @xmath59 ) in the final state .",
    "the signal cross - section here refers to the sum of vbf and vh processes .",
    "the atlas numbers have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , for which we show the @xmath60 range ( the central value is written within brackets ) . _ _ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as in equation  [ eff - def ] , we define the efficiency for this channel as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) as @xmath64_{\\rm after ~cuts}}{\\left[\\sigma(pp \\rightarrow h)_{\\rm vh , \\rm v \\rightarrow j j } \\times { \\rm br } ( h \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma )   \\right]_{\\rm before ~cuts}}. \\label{eff - def2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by performing a scan over the ( @xmath24,@xmath65 ) parameter space , we obtain the combined efficiencies ( for @xmath30 and @xmath29 ) of the isolation cuts and the atlas cuts in table  [ tab : gaga ] and they are well fit by the following functions : @xmath66 @xmath67 in equations  [ eff - bb - gaga ] and  [ eff - ww - gaga ] , the denominator and the numerator represent @xmath68 , before and after all the cuts respectively , and some common numerical factors between the two , like the total higgs decay width have been cancelled out .    in figures  [ fig : eff - vs - f - bb ] and  [",
    "fig : eff - vs - f - ww ] , we show the variation of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath63 and @xmath62 respectively for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the red ( solid ) , green ( dashed ) and black ( dot - dashed ) curves correspond to @xmath70 respectively . for @xmath71 or @xmath72 we recover the sm efficiency ( @xmath73 ) in both the cases for all values of @xmath24 . within the range of @xmath63 shown in figure  [",
    "fig : eff - vs - f - bb ] , the efficiency for @xmath74 can change from its sm value by upto @xmath75 , while for @xmath76 , it can increase by upto @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , for the range of @xmath62 shown in figure  [ fig : eff - vs - f - ww ] , for @xmath78 ( @xmath76 ) , the efficiency can increase from its sm value by upto @xmath79 @xmath80 .",
    "thus our overall conclusion is that the modification of cut efficiencies in the vh production mode is in general less pronounced than in the vbf higgs production with @xmath81 .",
    "since the modifications of cut efficiencies discussed so far originate from changes in kinematic distributions , in this section , we explore some of these distributions in the presence of higher dimensional operators .",
    "study of differential distributions is the next step in experimental analysis of the higgs sector , and preliminary results with the current data have already been presented in ref  @xcite . as an example we choose the diphoton channel in the vbf category  @xcite , and",
    "consider the operator @xmath29 for illustration .",
    "all the distributions are shown after applying the standard trigger and isolation cuts for jets and photons .",
    "the kinematic variables considered are :    * @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the two tagged jets ordered in terms of their transverse momenta .",

    "we have considered some illustrative dimension-6 operators for @xmath13 interactions , and their potential contributions to the higgs data , in conjunction with the sm - like operators . parametrizing the strength of the additional interactions by @xmath61 ( @xmath117 ) , and the simultaneous modification to the sm - like couplings to @xmath42 and @xmath43 bosons by @xmath24 , we show , after a detailed cut - based monte carlo analysis , how the efficiencies of different acceptance cuts are altered for various values of @xmath61 and @xmath24 .",
    "we find that in general there can be substantial modification of this kind , which underscores the importance of a detailed study of the effect of all such additional operators on the kinematics of various final states .",
    "when one further imposes the constraints on the ( @xmath118 ) space as resulting from a global fit of the lhc data available till date , the @xmath61-parameters are in general restricted to rather modest values while @xmath24 is restricted to be in the range @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "thus the effects of cuts in the diboson channels may not be drastically different , unless there is ground for relaxing their constraints .",
    "in general , the @xmath120 channel is more sensitive to the higher - dimensional operators than the gluon - fusion and @xmath121 production modes .",
    "we also present several kinematic distributions , some of which are used in bdt analyses , which can potentially bring out signatures of the new operators , even with moderate strength .",
    "it should be remembered here that our analysis is purely phenomenological and data - driven ; the assumption of any specific ultraviolet ( uv ) completion is deliberately avoided . in a specific uv completion scheme ,",
    "more than one higher - dimensional operator relevant at the lhc scale may be generated , which can affect some of our conclusions .",
    "for example , with additional operators present , a situation as restrictive as indicated by figure  [ fig : gaga - ww - total ] may not arise due to the accidental cancellation of different contributions .",
    "however , studying one operator at a time gives us valuable insight on how it typically affects various observables in the higgs sector  an insight that is lost in the introduction of all operators of a given dimension simultaneously . in this spirit , we have explored two operators which can most significantly modify the interaction of the higgs with a pair of electroweak gauge bosons .",

    "<S> the inclusion of higher - dimensional gauge invariant operators induces new lorentz structures in higgs couplings with electroweak gauge boson pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this in principle affects the kinematics of higgs production and decay , thereby modifying the efficiencies of the experimental cuts compared to what simulations based on the standard model interactions yield . </S>",
    "<S> taking some sample cases , we perform a rigorous analysis of how the efficiencies differ for various strengths of the additional operator vis - a - vis the standard model interactions , scanning over the values of both of them . while the response to cuts can be markedly different in some regions , we find that the sensitivity to new operator structures is relatively limited , so long as we remain confined to the 2@xmath0 regions around the best fit signal strengths measured at the large hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> we also show modifications to certain kinematical distributions including the new operators in the diphoton final state .     </S>",
