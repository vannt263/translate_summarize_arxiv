    "the empirical relation between the angular momentum and mass of celestial bodies was investigated for a long time .",
    "usually this relation is presented as @xmath2 .",
    "there are several methods of explanation single relation @xmath3 .",
    "muradyan explained this relation in terms of the ambarzumian s superdense cosmogony @xcite .",
    "mackrossan involved termodynamical consideration for its explanation @xcite .",
    "wesson ( 1983 ) argued that this is a consequence of self similarity of newtonian problem applied to rotating gravitionally bound systems @xcite .",
    "the considerations connected with this relation were involved in showing its possible important role in the unification of gravitation and particle physics @xcite , as well as in constructing the new universal constant @xcite . later on catalan and theuns explained the relation @xmath2 in the tidial torque model @xcite .",
    "sistero incorporated the rotational velocity of the universe @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was presented by carrasco , roth & serrano , who explained this relation as a consequence of mechanical equilibrium between the gravitational and rotational energy@xcite .",
    "already it was proposed by li more general relation @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it predict different relation for low magnitude of masses than simple @xmath4 . only for high masses simply relation between the angular momentum and mass of celestial bodies",
    "@xmath2 is satisfies .",
    "the crucial point of his paper @xcite is the explanation this relation for galaxies as a result of the influence of the global rotation of the universe on their formation .",
    "the problem of the rotation of the whole universe attracted the attention of several scientists since @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the reported value of rotation is too big when compared with the cmb anisotropy .",
    "silk @xcite pointed out that the dynamical effects of a general rotation of the universe are presently unimportant , contrary to the early universe for which angular velocity @xmath5 .",
    "he stressed that now the period of rotation must be greater than the hubble time , which is a simple consequence of the cmb isotropy .",
    "barrow , juszkiewicz and sonoda also addressed this question @xcite .",
    "they showed that the cosmic vorticity depends strongly on the cosmological models and assumptions connected with linearisation of homogeneous , anistropic cosmological models over the isotropic friedmann universe . for a flat universe",
    "the obtained the value @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to confront the generalized relation obtained from the li model with the observations . in the previous paper @xcite it",
    "was shown that the li relation between the angular momentum and the mass of the celestial bodies posses a minimum . in the present paper",
    "we discuss observational evidence allowing us to verify this relation .",
    "the angular momentum of a structure is the sum of spins of their components and its own angular momentum .",
    "there is no clear empirical evidence that galaxy groups and cluster rotate .",
    "therefore , the study of galaxy alignment ( i.e. ordering of galaxy axes or its normal vectors to galaxy planes ) in a large structure can be useful for testing , if the primordial correlation of galaxy spins can be still observed in present - day structures . in order to check li relation",
    "we need to calculate alignment for different size structures .",
    "the observations indicate that different galactic structures have different total angular momentum .",
    "we consider pair of galaxies , compact galaxy groups , groups of galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as superclusters .",
    "for two first and two last size ranges are taken from the literature .",
    "for this paper we analyse the alignment of galaxies in the galaxy groups . as a sample 18 tully s groups of galaxies @xcite",
    "is taken .",
    "we obtained that there is no alignment of the tully s groups .",
    "we interprete this as a zero value of total angular momentum . taking into account that the @xmath7 for the other sizes we find that all five groups fits well to generalized li relation .",
    "it seems that there is simple relation @xmath1 for the whole mass range while the global rotation ( even it is controversial ) allowes us to obtain the @xmath1 relation which well fit to data .",
    "this paper is organised in the following manner . in section 2 for the completence we present theoretical considerations , while section 3 gives the main results together with a discussion of the previous studies .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "in homogeneous and isotropic models , the universe with matter may not only expand , but also rotate relative to the local gyroscope .",
    "the motion of the matter can be described by the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "this is a relation between the scalar equation @xmath8 , the rotation tensor @xmath9 and the shear tensor @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the perfect fluid has the stress - energy tensor : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass density and @xmath13 is the pressure .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation can be written as : @xmath14 where : @xmath15 is the acceleration vector , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the scalar of rotation and shear respectively .",
    "it has been shown that a spatially homogeneous , rotating and expanding universe filled with a perfect fluid must have non - vanishing shear @xcite .    because @xmath18 falls off more rapidly than the rotation @xmath19",
    "as the universe expands , it is reasonable to consider such generalization of the friedman equation in which only the `` centrifugal '' term is present , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the curvature constant , @xmath23 a scalar factor and @xmath24    equation ( 2 ) should be completed with the principle of the conservation of energy - momentum tensor and angular momentum : @xmath25 @xmath26 from that we can observe that if @xmath27 ( dust ) , then @xmath28 and @xmath29 , while in general @xmath18 falls as @xmath30 @xcite",
    ". the law of momentum conservation should be satisfied for each kind of matter , and consequently angular velocity of the universe will evolve according to different laws in different epochs . before the decoupling ( @xmath31 ) , matter and radiation interact , but after decoupling dust and radiation evolve separately and they have their own angular velocities @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "parameters @xmath19 and @xmath12 can be written as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , with the latter being is the total mass density of matter and radiation .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum of a structure relative to the gyroscopic frames in dust epochs gives : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the density of ( dust ) matter in the present epoch , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the radius of protostructure , and @xmath41 is a parameter determined by the distribution of the mass in it . in this model we assumed that dark matter is collisionless and we considered only barionic matter .    in @xcite",
    "the present value of the angular velocity of the universe is estimated .",
    "a suitable value for @xmath22 parameter is assumed as 0.4 ( in cgs units ) .",
    "taking @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xcite for rich clusters of galaxies , see also @xcite , we obtain @xmath45    in our previous paper @xcite we show that relation ( 5 ) exhibits a clear minimum ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the value of mass of such structure is : @xmath46 and it does not depend on the present value of @xmath47 rotation of the universe .",
    "we should note that when @xmath48 , the corresponding mass @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to observed that for less and more masive structures considered model predict @xmath50 .",
    "it is interesting that from the observational point of view it is possible to observe just the cases when @xmath51 .",
    "it means that li model can be verified by observations .",
    "there is a large number of scenario of galaxy cluster formation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we assumed that galaxy clusters are formed through the collapse of the protostructures @xcite .",
    "for a protostructure with a diameter of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath54 as an estimate of dust mass for a formed structure with vanishing angular momentum .",
    "this gives the total mass of a structure of the order of @xmath55 , which is a typical mass of a small galaxy cluster .",
    "1 shows dependence of @xmath1 in that case .",
    "the masses of the order @xmath55 , for which the expected total angular momenta vanishes , are typical masses of the galaxy groups . therefore , we study the alignment of galaxies with the individual tully s group in the lsc @xcite .",
    "so for the present study we chose 18 tully s galaxy groups , each containing more than 40 galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we investigated the galaxy alignment in each group because the existence of alignment is interpreted as existence of non - vanishing angular momentum    in our analysis , we used the supergalactic coordinate system ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) with the basic great circle ( ` meridian ' ) chosen to pass through the lsc centre in the virgo cluster @xcite for any galaxy we consider two parameters : the galactic position angle @xmath13 and the inclination angle @xmath59 . with the use of these angles two orientation angles",
    "are determined : @xmath60 - angle between the normal to the galaxy and the lsc plane , and @xmath61 - angle between the projection of this normal on the the lsc plane and the direction toward the lsc centre ( seen from the earth ) .",
    "the distributions of the `` supergalatic position angles '' @xmath58 , as well as two angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be analyzed using statistical tests briefly summarized in the appendix .",
    "a detailed description of our method can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results of these statistical analyses are given in tables 1 - 3 .",
    "the tables show the results of statistical tests ( @xmath62 test , fourier test and autocorrelation test ) .",
    "table 1 and 2 contains the results of the investigations of galaxy plane orientations .",
    "it follows that a weak alignment of galaxy planes is observed . however , the real alignment is very small , because a part of these positive - signal detections is due to the observational effect in determining galaxy axies in the tully catalogue @xcite .",
    "moreover , when we analysed spiral galaxies only , we found no group exhibiting clear evidence for alignment existence .",
    "the analysis of the distribution of galaxy position angles ( table 3 ) shows non - randomness in one group only .",
    "so we conclude that in the case of the tully s group we do not find any galaxy alignment .    it should be noted that ( because of the small number of object ) we repeated the derivations for different values of @xmath63 bins ( see appendix ) , but no significant differences were observed .",
    ".test for isotropy of the orientations of galaxy plane .",
    "the distribution of the angle @xmath60 of galaxies ( tully s group ) [ cols=\"^,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     there is no clear empirical evidence that galaxy groups and cluster rotate .",
    "however , some evidence connected with the motion of their components around the mass centre in very poor groups can be observed . as a result , it can be accepted that the angular momentum of a galaxy group or cluster is connected mainly with the galaxy spins .",
    "even when taking into account the eventual orbital motion of galaxies around the common mass centre , it can be easily seen that more numerous structures exhibit larger angular momentum .",
    "because of that reason , we assumed that total angular momentum of the galactic groups and clusters consists from the sum of spins of their components only .",
    "for masses of structure close to @xmath64 we do not find evidence that angular momenta @xmath65 , which is in agreement with predictions of the considered li model .",
    "the less massive structures are compact groups and galaxy pairs . in compact groups of galaxies , member galaxies",
    "rotate along elongated orbits around the gravitational centre of the group @xcite which obviously add some angular momentum to the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "the study of paired galaxies showed that the angular momentum in these systems becomes mainly in the orbital motion of galaxies @xcite .",
    "it showed that for the structures with masses smaler then @xmath64 there are some indicators of the non - vanishing angular momentum .",
    "the study of galaxy orientation , which substitutes the investigation of the galaxy spin distribution , yields different results .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that in isolated abell clusters of galaxies only the dominant brightest cluster members exhibit the sign of alignment @xcite .",
    "however , in very rich galaxy clusters , such as a754 @xcite , or a1656 @xcite the non - random distribution of galaxies has been observed .",
    "a lot of work has been done in the study of the alignment of galaxies in superclusters ( for earlier work , see the review of djorgovski @xcite .",
    "the results are ambigous , but several independent investigations claimed the existence of a weak alignment of galaxies in respect to the supercluster s main plane .",
    "this was the case of the local supercluster @xcite , hercules supercluster @xcite , coma / a1367 @xcite , and the perseus supercluster @xcite . in the latter supercluster ,",
    "the weak alignment has been observed also when data taken from scans , i.e. without a personal bias @xcite , were involved instead of the data derived from visual measurements .",
    "the distribution of real spins was random , but the sample considered was small @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned studies were restricted to the high - density regions of superclusters . from the above considerations it follows that the alignment of galaxies in abell clusters is much weaker than in the case of superclusters .",
    "summarising our results , there is an evidence of non - vanishing angular momentum in both small and larger structures , but not for galaxy groups .",
    "our results also show that during analising our sample of the galaxy groups , the most prominent possible alignment of galaxy plane orientation , we obtain for the virgo cluster itself , the most massive substructure studied by us .",
    "this results are consistent with predictions of the discussed li model .",
    "in the present paper we discuss the relation between angular momentum and mass of the galaxy structures obtained from li model . the classical relation",
    "@xmath3 implies a monotonical increase of angular momentum with the mass .",
    "we show that this simple relation is not confirmed by observations . in the li model simple relation @xmath66",
    "is valid only for larger masses , while the model predicts the presences of a minimum in the relation beetwen angular momenta and masses of galaxy structures .",
    "it is interesting that the zero of @xmath1 relation can be tested observationally .",
    "we demonstrate that with resonable assumptions the mass @xmath64 for which @xmath48 , corresponds to galaxy group mass .",
    "analysing tully s groups of galaxies we do not find any evidence for galaxy alignment for that groups . our results - evidence for vanishing angular momentum for the galaxy grups and indicators of non - vanishing angular momentum for less and more masive structures is consistent with predictions of the discussed model .",
    "our general conclusion is that li model in which celestial bodies acquire angular momenta during their formation from the global rotation of the universe , gives us correct predictions .",
    "this for example explain why for galaxy groups , contrary to the more massive structures , no alignment of galaxies is dedected .",
