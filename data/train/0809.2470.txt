    "there are two more likely pictures regarding the growth of angular momentum in dark matter haloes .",
    "+ the first is that galactic haloes acquired their angular momentum from the tidal torques of the surrounding matter .",
    "this is an old idea of hoyle ( 1949 ) that has been investigated in a large number of studies ( e.g. peebles 1969 ; doroshkevich 1970 ; efstathiou & jones 1979 , barnes & efstathiou 1987 , white 1984 ; voglis & hiotelis 1989 , warren et al .",
    "1992 , steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ) .",
    "the results of the above studies , analytical and numerical , show that the spin parameter @xmath3 , introduced by peebles ( 1969 ) and defined by the relation @xmath4 , has an average value of about 0.05 - 0.07 , where @xmath5 is the modulus of the spin of halo , @xmath6 are the mass and the energy respectively and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant . according to the above picture , haloes acquire their angular momentum during their linear stage of their evolution because during this stage they have large linear sizes and thus the environment is capable to affect their evolution by tidal torques .",
    "since their expansion is decelerating their relative linear size becomes smaller and the affection by the environment becoms less significant .",
    "the moment of the maximum expansion is in practice the end of the epoch of growth of angular momentum . at latter times",
    ", the halo evolves as a dynamically isolated system .",
    "steinmetz & bartelmann ( 1995 ) showed that the dependence of the probability distribution of @xmath3 on the density parameter of the model universe as well as on the variance of the density contrast field is very weak . only a marginal tendency for @xmath3",
    "is found to be larger for late - forming objects in an open universe .",
    "+ the second picture is closely related to the hierarchical clustering scenario of cold dark matter ( cdm ; blumenthal et al .",
    "according to this scenario , structures in the universe grow from small initially gaussian density perturbations that progressively detach from the general expansion , reach a maximum radius and then collapse to form bound objects .",
    "larger haloes are formed hierarchically by mergers between smaller ones , called progenitors .",
    "the buildup of angular momentum is a random walk process associated with the mass assembly history of the halo s major progenitor .",
    "the main role of tidal torques in this picture is to produce the random tangential velocities of merging progenitors .",
    "+ the above two pictures of formation are usually studied by two different kinds of methods .",
    "the first kind is the n - body simulations that are able to follow the evolution of a large number of particles under the influence of the mutual gravity , from initial conditions to the present epoch .",
    "the second kind consists of semi - analytical methods . among them ,",
    "the press - schechter ( ps ) approach and its extensions ( eps ) are of great interest since they allow to compute mass functions ( press & schechter 1974 ; bond et al . 1991 ) to approximate merging histories ( lacey & cole 1993 , bower 1991 , sheth & lemson 1999b ) and to estimate the spatial clustering of dark matter haloes ( mo & white 1996 ; catelan et al .",
    "1998 , sheth & lemson 1999a ) .",
    "+ recently large cosmological n - body simulations have been performed in order to study the angular momentum of dark matter haloes in @xmath8 models of the universe ( e.g. bullock 2001 , kasun & evrard 2005 , bailin & steinmetz 2005 , avila - reese et al . 2005 , gottlber & turchaninov 2006 ) .",

    "hiotelis & del popolo ( 2006 ) showed that using the ec model , formation times are shifted to smaller values than those predicted by a spherical collapse model .",
    "additionally , ec model , combined with the stable clustering hypothesis , was used in order to study density profiles of dark matter haloes ( hiotelis 2006 ) .",
    "the resulting density profiles at the central regions of haloes have the interesting feature to be closer to the results of observations than the results of n - body simulations .",
    "consequently , the ec model is a significant improvement of the spherical model and therefore we use this model for our calculations .",
    "+ we assume a number of haloes with the same present day mass @xmath42 -at present epoch @xmath43- and we study their past using merger - trees by finding their progenitors -haloes that merged and formed the present day haloes- at previous times .",

    "+ a complete description of the above numerical method is given in hiotelis & del popolo ( 2006 ) . the algorithm - known as n - branch merger - tree- is based on the pioneered works of lace & cole ( 1993 ) , somerville & kollat ( 1999 ) and van den bosch ( 2002 ) . + in our calculations , we used a flat model for the universe with present day density parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "+ we note here that the growth of angular momentum in the above presented picture is not so smooth as in the case of the tidal torque theory where the angular momentum is a simple increasing function of time ( eg .",

    "this is supported , for example , by the results of bett et al . 2007 and macci@xmath187 et al . 2007 .",
    "additionally , bett et al . showed that the values of spin parameter and its behavior as a function of mass depends crucially on the halo - finding algorithm .",
    "this conclusion was derived by studying three different halo - finding algorithms , the traditional `` friends - of - friends '' ( fof ) algorithm of davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , the `` spherical overdensity '' so ) of lacey & cole ( 1994 ) and a new halo definition that they introduced , the tree haloes .",

    "more specifically , they have shown that haloes which have suffered large recent major mergers appear to have larger values of spin parameter .",
    "we define as recent mergers those occurred at redshifts @xmath196 .",
    "we consider the merge between a large halo @xmath35 and a small @xmath111 as major if @xmath197 .",
    "obviously a recent major merger satisfies both the above conditions . figs.5 and 6 show the dependence of the @xmath183 distribution on the number of recent major mergers for three of our cases namely c1 , c3 and c5 . in fig.6 solid lines",
    "show the distribution of @xmath183 for all haloes of the respective case , while dashed lines are the distributions over those haloes that had at least one recent major merger .",
    "dotted lines are the distributions of haloes that had no recent major mergers .",
    "it is clear , particularly at low masses as in case c1 , that dashed lines represent distributions that are shifted to the right relative to that represented by solid lines .",
    "thus , haloes that had at least one recent major merger have larger spin parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "haloes that had no recent major merger -represented by dotted lines- show a narrow distribution shifted to the left , relative to the solid line , that has an obviously smaller mean value .     as a function of the present day mass @xmath153 of the halo .",
    "although the values of @xmath0 are not very sensitive to the values of the mass , as they vary from 0.0343 to 0.0489 for a range of mass 0.01 to 100 , our results show that @xmath183 is an increasing function of the mass of the halo . the linear dependence shown , @xmath198 , in this figures indicates that @xmath183 varies as a power of @xmath153.,width=302 ]         while the vertical one represent the fractions of various groups of haloes .",
    "squares correspond to the case c1,stars to the case c3 and triangles to the case c5 . from top to bottom symbols mark the mean value of spin parameter versus the fraction for the following groups : i ) all haloes of the case , ii ) haloes that had at least one recent major merger , iii ) haloes that had at least two recent major mergers and iii ) , haloes that had at least three recent major mergers .",
    "the square in the circle marks @xmath183 for those haloes of the case c1 that had no recent major mergers .",
    "the same hold for the star inside the circle and the triangle inside the circle but for the cases c3 and c5 respectively .",

    ", width=302 ]        in fig .",
    "6 we present @xmath183 for various groups of haloes from the cases c1 and c5 versus the fraction of the total number of haloes of the case that these groups represent .",
    "squares correspond to the case c1 , stars to the case c3 and triangles to the case c5 . from the left to the right symbols mark the mean value of spin parameter versus the fraction for the following groups : i ) all haloes of the case , ii ) haloes that had at least one recent major merger , iii ) haloes that had at least two recent major mergers and iv ) haloes that had at least three recent major mergers .",
    "the square inside the circle marks @xmath183 for those haloes of the case c1 that had no recent major mergers . the same is indicated by the star inside the circle and the triangle inside the circle for the cases c3 and c5 , respectively .",
    "this fig . shows that @xmath183 is an increasing function of the number of recent major mergers .",
    "for example , the group , from case c1 , of haloes that had at least one recent major merger has @xmath199 and represents @xmath200% of the total haloes of the case while the group of haloes that had at least three major merger has @xmath201 and represents only @xmath202% of the total number of haloes of the case .",
    "for the group of haloes that had no recent major merger @xmath203 , a significantly low value , while the haloes of this group represent @xmath204% of the total number of haloes of the case .",
    "it is noticed that as the haloes belonging to that last group had an unperturbed recent history , they have time to evolve their gas smoothly to a rotationally supporting disk . its fraction is an decreasing function of the final halo mass .",
    "for case c5 only @xmath205% belong to that group .",
    "the fraction of haloes with no recent major merger is definitely a decreasing function of the present day mass of the halo .",
    "it is quite reasonable , in the hierarchical clustering scenario studied here , that recent major mergers become rare effects for small haloes",
    ". it would be interesting to see if , at fixed number of recent major mergers , the distribution of @xmath0 is independent of mass .",
    "for this reason , in fig.7 we plotted the mean value of @xmath0 for haloes that have suffered the same number of recent major mergers(0,1,2,3 and 4 ) for all cases .",
    "different symbols correspond to haloes of different masses .",
    "squares correspond to c1 , stars to c2 , diamonds to c3 , circles to c4 and deltas to c5 .",
    "it is clear from this fig .",
    "that for haloes that have suffered the same number of recent major mergers , the heavier one has the larger @xmath0 . summarizing the results it is yielded that : a ) in all cases haloes that had at least one recent major merger have @xmath183 larger than those haloes that had none .",
    "b ) the fraction of haloes that had at least one recent major merger is larger than the fraction of haloes that had no recent major mergers at all .",
    "thus , we can draw the following conclusions : + 1 ) disk galaxies are found preferentially in small haloes .",
    "+ 2 ) between haloes of the same mass those that host elliptical galaxies rotate faster than haloes of spiral galaxies ( see vitvitska et al .",
    "+ 3 ) the number of haloes that had no recent major merges is significantly smaller that the number of haloes that had at least one major merger . if we took into account that major mergers destroy galactic disks and produce spheroidal stellar systems ( see , e.g. , barnes 1999 ) small mergers",
    "probably do not ( see , e.g. , walker , mihos $ hernquist 1996 ) it is natural to expect that haloes which have suffered at least one major merger could not a host a spiral galaxy .",
    "however spheroidal stellar systems should be more common objects than spiral galaxies .",
    "+ fig.8 depicts the dependence of the distribution of spin parameter on the redshift @xmath147 .",
    "solid lines correspond to present day @xmath206 while dashed and dotted lines to @xmath207 and to @xmath208 respectively . from the left to the right , snapshots correspond to the cases c1 , c3 and c5 respectively",
    ". differences between @xmath206 and @xmath207 are small .",
    "curves at @xmath207 appear with smaller peaks and a slight shift , relative to curve for @xmath206 , to the right for small haloes and to the left for larger haloes .",
    "differences between @xmath206 and @xmath208 are more obvious .",
    "dashed curves are , for all cases , shifted to the right relative to solid curves .",
    "the form of the distributions remains practically unchanged .",
    "a shift of the distribution to the right shows that the mean value of the spin parameter becomes larger while a shift to the left shows that it becomes smaller .",
    "thus , the curves indicate that the value of the spin parameter decreases from @xmath208 to @xmath206 for all cases . this is verified by the straightforward evaluation of @xmath183 that appears to be systematically smaller at @xmath206 than its value at @xmath208 .",
    "this study describes a picture for the growth of the angular momentum of dark matter haloes in terms of a hierarchical clustering scenario .",
    "the results presented above are , in general , in good agreement with the results that were already known in the literature . comparing our results with those of large n - body simulations",
    ", we have found satisfactory agreement in the following points : + 1 ) the values of spin parameter are in the range of 0.0343 to 0.0484 for haloes with present day masses in the range of @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "+ 2 ) a log - normal distribution approximates satisfactorily the distributions of the values of the spin parameter but it fails to describe accurately the tails of the resulting distributions . a new , more satisfactory formula ,",
    "is presented .",
    "+ 3 ) the role of recent major mergers is very important .",
    "the distribution of the spin parameter is appreciably affected by the number of recent major merger .",
    "the present day value of the spin parameter of a halo is an increasing function of the number of the recent major mergers .",
    "+ 4 ) the distributions of the spin parameter do not depend significantly on the redshift .",
    "+ 5 ) the value of the spin parameter is a function of the present day mass of the halo .",
    "the form of this function depends , in n - body simulations , on the halo - finding algorithm but in general seems that spin parameter is a decreasing function of mass .",
    "instead , in our results , @xmath183 is an increasing function of mass , approximately very closely a power - law form .",
    "+ our results give rise to some questions , as for example : why semi - analytical methods are not able to predict the correct relation between the spin parameter and the virial mass of the halo ?",
    "does this disagreement reflects the null role of tidal fields in the orbital - merger picture or it arises from other problems associated with the nature of merger - trees ?",
    "are merger - trees able to give the correct relation for better description of the velocity field during the merge ?",
