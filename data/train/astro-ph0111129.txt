    "the rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity density of the universe traces the history of cosmic star formation because it is produced by hot , massive , young stars .",
    "previous measurements have found that the ultraviolet luminosity density increases with redshift to a maximum at redshift @xmath3 to 2 and then decreases ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) or remains constant ( madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ; steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; hopkins , connolly , & szalay 2000 ) with redshift to higher redshifts .",
    "these previous measurements have been interpreted in the context of galaxy formation and evolution scenarios as indicating that the stellar content of galaxies was formed gradually , over most of cosmic time ( e.g.  somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) .",
    "but previous measurements have neglected cosmological surface brightness dimming effects , which can play a dominant role in setting what is observed at high redshifts ( pascarelle , lanzetta , & fernndez - soto 1998 ) . specifically , surface brightness ( per unit frequency interval ) decreases with redshift as @xmath4 due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "this has an important consequence for observations of distant galaxies : while both intrinsically bright and intrinsically faint regions of low - redshift galaxies are accessible to observation , only intrinsically bright regions of high - redshift galaxies are accessible to observation  intrinsically faint regions of high - redshift galaxies are of low surface brightness and are simply not detected against the background noise . thus all measurements _ miss _ some fraction of the light of distant galaxies ; this fraction is small for low - redshift galaxies but can be dominant for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "here we address this issue by examining the distribution of `` unobscured '' star formation rate intensities versus redshift  i.e .",
    "the star formation rate intensities that are directly inferred from the observed rest - frame ultraviolet light that is not obscured by intervening dust .",
    "we use the star formation rate intensity distribution function to assess the ultraviolet luminosity density versus redshift , based on our photometry and photometric redshift measurements of faint galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) and hubble deep field south ( hdf  s ) wfpc2 and nicmos fields ( lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez - soto 1996 ; fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ; yahata et al .",
    "2000 ; yahata et al.2001 in preparation ) .",
    "the star formation rate intensity distribution function bears on the issue because it makes explicit the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming on observations of high - redshift galaxies , thereby allowing the amount by which previous measurements have underestimated the ultraviolet luminosity density at high redshifts to be directly estimated . because our measurements neglect the effects of obscuration by dust , they represent _ lower limits _ to the total star formation rate density .",
    "the framework of the unobscured star formation rate intensity and the star formation rate intensity distribution function is presented in   2 .",
    "the photometry and photometric redshift measurements are summarized in   3 , the angular area versus",
    "depth relations are summarized in   4 , and the stony brook faint galaxy redshift survey is summarized in   5 .",

    "results are described in   7 , and the connection with the neutral hydrogen column density distribution function is described in ",
    "the summary and conclusions are presented in   9 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt a standard friedmann cosmological model of dimensionless hubble constant @xmath5 ) and deceleration parameter @xmath6 ; this is the same cosmological model adopted for previous measurements of the rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity density .",
    "to address the issue of the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming , we examine the distribution of `` unobscured '' star formation rate intensities versus redshift .",
    "we designate the unobscured star formation rate intensity as @xmath7 and the star formation rate intensity distribution function as @xmath8 .",
    "the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 bears on the issue because it makes explicit the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming on observations of high - redshift galaxies .    by `` unobscured star formation rate intensity , '' we mean the star formation rate intensity that is _ directly inferred _ from the rest - frame ultraviolet light that is not obscured by intervening dust .",
    "hence unobscured star formation rate intensity ( measured , say , in units of @xmath9 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 ) is _ equivalent to _ rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity per unit area ( measured , say , in units of erg s@xmath10 hz@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 ) , once some fixed scaling between ultraviolet luminosity and star formation rate ( which is set by the stellar initial mass function ) is specified . to determine the _ total _",
    "star formation rate intensity from the unobscured star formation rate intensity would require knowledge of the effects of obscuration by intervening dust , which is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "rather , here we address _ only _ the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming .",
    "we emphasize that because our measurements neglect the effects of obscuration by dust , they represent _ lower limits _ to the total star formation rate density .",
    "we define the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 in such a way that @xmath12 is the projected proper area per comoving volume of unobscured star formation rate intensity in the interval @xmath7 to @xmath13 .",
    "the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 is a fundamental statistical description of the evolving galaxy population , similar in spirit to the galaxy luminosity function but cast in terms of star formation rate intensity ( derived from measurement of surface brightness ) rather than luminosity ( derived from measurement of energy flux ) . for our purposes ,",
    "the first moment of @xmath8 @xmath14 is of particular interest .",
    "the first moment of @xmath8 is the unobscured star formation rate density @xmath15 , which is equivalent to within a factor of scale to the ultraviolet luminosity density @xmath16 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) makes explicit the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming on measurement of the ultraviolet luminosity density : in equation ( 1 ) , the limits of integration extend from @xmath17 through @xmath18 .",
    "but in practice , a given observation ( at a given redshift ) is sensitive only to some star formation rate intensity threshold @xmath19 , which is set by the surface brightness threshold of the observation ( and the redshift ) . whether or not a given observation ( at a given redshift )",
    "is suitable for measuring the ultraviolet luminosity density depends on whether or not @xmath19 is less than the value of @xmath7 above which the bulk of the ultraviolet luminosity density is emitted . here",

    "we registered the images ( to an accuracy of typically 0.25 pixel for space - based images and 0.5 pixel for ground - based images ) by appropriate translation , rotation , and scaling using our own algorithms and software , and we identified and masked cosmic ray events using our own algorithms and software .",

    ", the shorter - wavelength bandpasses ( which are generally of higher sensitivity and resolution but which are unsuitable for detecting high - redshift galaxies ) were used to detect low- and moderate - redshift galaxies and the longer - wavelength bandpasses ( which are generally of lower sensitivity and resolution but which are suitable for detecting high - redshift galaxies ) were used to detect high - redshift galaxies .",

    "we assessed the accuracy and reliability of the photometric redshift measurements by comparing photometric redshift measurements with spectroscopic redshift measurements of galaxies identified in the hdf and hdf  s .",

    "2001 for the latest description of this comparison and for an assessment of the accuracy and reliability of the photometric and spectroscopic redshift measurement techniques . )",
    "second , the redshift likelihood functions of most ( but not all ) of the galaxies of redshift measurement @xmath35 are sufficiently broad or multiply - peaked that lower - redshift solutions can not be excluded . hence a `` best - fit '' redshift measurement @xmath35 does not by itself indicate a redshift @xmath35in every case the redshift likelihood function must be consulted to identify the range of allowed redshifts . and third , our bootstrap error analysis ( described below ) explicity accounts for cases of broad or multiply - peaked redshift likelihood functions .",
    "the emphasis of the present analysis is on redshifts @xmath22 , and the galaxies of redshift measurement @xmath35 do not bear significantly on our primary conclusions .",

    "we describe our measurements of the star formation rate intensity distribution function .",
    "first , we determined the rest - frame 1500   luminosity of each pixel , using the measured energy flux of the pixel , the redshift of the pixel ( which is set by the redshift of the host galaxy ) , the empirical @xmath21 correction of the pixel ( which is set by the spectrophotometric template of the host galaxy ) , and the cosmological model .",
    "then , we determined the star formation rate of each pixel , using a salpeter stellar initial mass function to scale rest - frame 1500 luminosity to star formation rate .",
    "then , we determined the proper area of each pixel , using the redshift of the pixel , the angular plate scale of the image , and the cosmological model .",

    ". the star formation rate intensity @xmath7 is measured , say , in units of @xmath9 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 .",
    "next , we summed the proper areas of all pixels within given star formation rate intensity and redshift intervals .",
    "then , we determined the comoving volumes that correspond to the redshift intervals , using the angular area versus depth relation and the cosmological model .",
    "then , we divided the summed proper areas by the appropriate star formation rate intensity intervals and comoving volumes to determine the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 at values of the star formation rate intensity @xmath7 down to the noise thresholds of the images . finally , we _ excluded _ measurements of @xmath8 at values of @xmath7 less than the values that could have been detected at the @xmath38 level over 95% of the angular area of the survey . the segmentation maps that define the isophotal apertures of the galaxies contain , of course ,",
    "pixels of insignificant or even negative measured energy flux ( because the segmentation maps are defined with respect to smoothed versions of the images . )",
    "thus low - intensity pixels near the edges of the segmentation maps are unsuitable for incorporation into the measurement of @xmath8 , since roughly half of these pixels have negative measured energy flux and so can not bear on the analysis .",
    "considering only high - intensity values of @xmath7 eliminates the possibility that low - intensity pixels near the edges of the segmentation maps bias the measurement of @xmath8 .",
    "we verified that the measurement of @xmath8 at our adopted star formation rate intensity thresholds is not affected by pixel - to - pixel noise by redetermining @xmath8 from within the segmentation maps but with the actual images replaced by gaussian noise ( according to the actual noise properties of the images ) .",
    "the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 is measured , say , in units of kpc@xmath28 ( @xmath9 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11)@xmath10 mpc@xmath39 .",
    "we determined measurement uncertainties of the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 by applying a variation of the `` bootstrap '' resampling technique described previously by lanzetta , fernndez - soto , & yahil ( 1998 ) .",
    "the bootstrap resampling technique explicitly accounts for effects of sampling uncertainty , photometric uncertainty , and variance with respect to the spectrophotometric templates .",
    "first , we resampled objects from the catalogs ( allowing the possibility of duplication ) , added random noise to the photometry ( according to the actual noise properties of the images ) and redetermined the photometric redshift measurements , and added random noise to the photometric redshift measurements ( according to the actual noise properties of the photometric redshift technique , as determined from the comparison of photometric and spectroscopic redshift measurements ) .",
    "then , we determined the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 from the resampled , perturbed catalogs of photometry and photometric redshifts exactly as from the actual catalogs of photometry and photometric redshifts . finally , we repeated these steps a large number of times in order to trace out the distributions of measurement uncertainties .",
    "results of our analysis are shown in figure 3 , which plots the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath8 versus the star formation rate intensity @xmath7 as a function of redshift @xmath24 .",
    "several points are evident on the basis of figure 3 :    first , the star formation rate intensity threshold of the observations is a steep function of redshift , ranging from @xmath40 @xmath9 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 at @xmath41 , to @xmath42 @xmath9 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 at @xmath43 , to @xmath44 @xmath9 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 at @xmath45 .",
    "second , at the redshifts @xmath46 at which both low- and high - intensity star formation rate intensities can be measured , @xmath47 versus @xmath48 is characterized by a relatively shallow dependence at @xmath49 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 and a relatively steep dependence at @xmath50 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 .",
    "the shallow dependence is sufficiently shallow and the steep dependence is sufficiently steep that , from equation ( 1 ) , the bulk of the ultraviolet luminosity density is emitted where the two regions join , i.e.  at @xmath51 yr@xmath10 kpc@xmath11 .",
    "this implies that to measure the bulk of the ultraviolet luminosity density requires sensitivity to star formation rate intensities _ less than _ the intensity @xmath52",

    "third , the high - intensity end of @xmath8which is directly measured at all redshifts through @xmath54evolves more or less monotonically toward higher values at higher redshifts .",

    "further , application of equation ( 5 ) to a power - law form of the column density distribution function @xmath89 of slope @xmath90 ( storrie - lombardi , irwin , & mcmahon 1996 ) predicts a power - law form of the star formation rate intensity distribution function @xmath91 of slope @xmath92 , which is in excellent agreement with the slope @xmath93 measured at redshifts @xmath41 to @xmath94 .",
    "we take the remarkable agreement between @xmath81 expressed in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath8in terms of both amplitude and slope  to ( 1 ) suggest that the actual functional form of @xmath8 at redshifts @xmath75 does not differ dramatically from the function forms of the three simple variants of the fiducial model ( and that the third variant is slightly favored over the other two variants ) and ( 2 ) establish a quantitative connection between high - redshift galaxies and high column density gas and suggest that high - redshift damped  absorption systems trace lower star formation rate intensity regions of the same galaxies detected in star light in the hdf and hdf  s .    of course ,",

    "s is _ on average _ consistent with the relationship between column density and star formation rate intensity measured on galactic scales for nearby galaxies .",
    "we address the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming on observations of faint galaxies by examining the distribution of `` unobscured '' star formation rate intensities versus redshift , which we use to assess the ultraviolet luminosity density versus redshift , using our photometry and photometric redshift measurements of faint galaxies in the hdf and the hdf  s wfpc2 and nicmos fields .",
