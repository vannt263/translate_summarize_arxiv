    "overcoming the diffraction limit and focusing waves on a deep - subwavelength scale have been widely pursued for light , microwave and acoustics .",
    "the tight focusing not only can strongly enhance linear and nonlinear interactions between waves and matter , but also greatly improve the spatial resolution in sensing , imaging and communication .",
    "it is well known that in a homogeneous medium , wave diffraction limits the size of a focal spot to half the wavelength .",
    "this limit can be understood in a simple case of a monochromatic scalar wave .",
    "consider a spherical wave @xmath0 converging to the origin @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the angular frequency , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the wavelength .",
    "after passing the origin , the wave becomes diverging , of the form @xmath5 .",
    "the total field is a superposition of the two , i.e , @xmath6 , which is proportional to the imaginary part of green s function  @xcite - the solution to the wave equation in a homogeneous medium .",
    "the minus sign of the diverging wave causes a destructive interference of the incoming and outgoing waves , which removes the singularity at @xmath7 .",
    "the focal spot has a width of @xmath8 , the well - known diffraction limit .",
    "therefore , diffraction is a consequence of destructive interference of the converging and diverging waves .",
    "one way of breaking the diffraction limit is to make the interference constructive by flipping the sign of outgoing wave , so that the total field becomes @xmath9 .",
    "this can be done by placing a resonant scatterer at the origin . below the resonant frequency ,",
    "the diffracted wave experiences a @xmath10 phase shift .",
    "for the visible light , the surface plasmon resonance of a metallic nanosphere might be used .",
    "the intrinsic absorption of metal , however , would weaken the interference effect .",
    "an alternative is to utilize the absorption to eliminate the outgoing wave , so the total field is equal to the incoming one @xmath5 .",
    "this can be realized by placing a perfect absorber at the origin .",
    "the field amplitude , albeit a factor of two smaller than in the first case , approaches infinity as @xmath11 .",
    "diffraction is thus overcome , as demonstrated by de rosny and fink in an acoustic wave experiment @xcite .",
    "they used a time - reversed sink to cancel the diffracted wave @xmath0 and obtained a focal spot smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "this active drain can operate over a broad frequency range , but it requires prior knowledge of the incoming signal  @xcite and a setup to generate the time reverse source at the focal spot .",
    "the idea of using a drain to remove the diverging wave has recently been extended to microwaves  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a passive drain which is not driven externally and does not need prior knowledge of the temporal profile of the impinging wave .",
    "this method is based on the coherent perfect absorber we recently developed @xcite .",
    "perfect absorption of coherent light by two- or three - dimensional metallic nanostructures can be achieved via critical coupling to surface plasmon resonances @xcite .",
    "although it was originally demonstrated for narrow - band operation , we will show here that perfect absorption can be realized over a continuous band of frequency by engineering the dispersion of the complex dielectric function .",
    "we demonstrate in numerical simulation that a 6.7 fs pulse is focused from far field to a region of @xmath13 nm .",
    "the temporal shape of the pulse can be arbitrary ; as long as the spatial wavefront matches the time - reversed radiation pattern of a surface plasmon resonance , the incident pulse will be completely absorbed .",
    "the perfect absorption of an ultrashort optical pulse results in strong localization of the electric field energy in space and time , which greatly enhances light - matter interactions , e.g. , two - photon excitation of molecules . not only the field amplitude but also the field gradient is enhanced by many orders of magnitude , when the incoming light is critically coupled to a multipole resonance of surface plasmon in the metallic nanoparticle .",
    "the steeply varying field can efficiently excite the dipole - forbidden transitions of molecules and probe the dark states .",
    "hence , the broad - band perfect absorber may be useful for ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy and sensing at the nanoscale .",
    "furthermore , our scheme is general and applicable to other types of waves , e.g. acoustic wave , microwave , pointing to possible applications in shock wave lithotripsy , microwave communication with deep - subwavelength resolution @xcite .",
    "in principle , if a subwavelength object is placed at @xmath1 , the outgoing wave can undergo a phase shift and its amplitude may be reduced .",
    "this two effects are respectively due to the internal resonance and dissipation of the object .",
    "the destructive interference effect cancels the diverging part of the field only when the incoming and outgoing waves have the same amplitude and @xmath10 phase difference .",
    "any deviation from these conditions leads to a subwavelength enhancement of the field .",
    "that is why the commonly used plane wave illumination of a metallic nanoparticle , that is dissipative and has resonance close to the optical excitation wavelength , produces a strong local field enhancement . in the introduction section we discussed two extreme scenarios to optimize the subwavelength field enhancement : adjusting only the amplitude or the phase of the outgoing wave . in this section",
    ", we will consider more general cases .",
    "first , we show how to change the relative phase between the converging and diverging waves to make them interfere constructively . for simplicity , we limit our analysis to two - dimensional ( 2d ) waves , the extension to 3d is straight - forward @xcite .",
    "let us consider a cylindrical wave propagates in the @xmath14 plane towards the origin ; its magnetic field is along the @xmath15 axis . after converging at the origin ,",
    "the wave diverges , and the total field can be written in the polar coordinates as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the @xmath19th - order hankel function of the first ( second ) kind and represents an outgoing ( incoming ) wave .",
    "the complex number , @xmath20 , is the relative amplitude of the outgoing wave ; in the absence of dissipation the outgoing wave carries the same energy as the incoming wave , @xmath21 .",
    "the phase of @xmath20 is determined by the solution to the maxwell s equations , which gives @xmath22 in vacuum or lossless dielectric media .",
    "although both @xmath23 and @xmath24 diverge at @xmath1 , the total field remains finite , because the diverging part of @xmath23 is canceled by that of @xmath24 .",
    "this cancellation can be regarded as a consequence of destructive interference between the incoming and outgoing waves .    to switch to constructive interference",
    ", we must reverse the sign of @xmath20 .",
    "one way is placing a cylinder of radius @xmath25 at @xmath7 to interact with the incident wave . due to the cylindrical symmetry of the system ,",
    "the angular momentum @xmath19 is conserved upon scattering , so is the polarization .",
    "thus the total field outside the cylinder ( @xmath26 ) has the same expression as before , but with a different value of @xmath20 ; inside the cylinder ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the bessel function of the first kind , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the complex dielectric function of the cylinder , and @xmath32 is a normalization constant . by matching the fields at the cylinder surface ( @xmath33 ) , we solve for @xmath20 and get @xmath34 } /{[j_m ' ( n k r ) h^{(1)}_m ( k r ) - n j_m(n k",

    "the enhancement originates from the same dipole resonance , thus the behavior is similar .",
