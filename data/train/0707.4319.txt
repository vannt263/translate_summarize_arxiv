    "the search for neutrino electromagnetic properties is as old as neutrino theories  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction of dirac neutrino is described by four form - factors : vector , axial vector , magnetic and electric ones  @xcite . in the low energy limit",
    "the first two form - factors are related with neutrino effective vector and axial vector ( anapole ) charge radii , the magnetic and electric form factors are related with neutrino magnetic and dipole moments , respectively . in case of majorana neutrinos only axial vector form factor and off - diagonal magnetic and electric dipole moments are non - zero , but still one can not distinguish dirac from majorana neutrinos in these interactions because of the relativistic nature of neutrinos .    the gauge - invariant definition of the neutrino effective charge radius as a physical observable has been discussed since a long time  @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that gauge - dependent terms cancel each other and therefore neutrino charge radius can be defined as a gauge - invariant physical observable  @xcite ; however , theoretical expectations  @xcite for electron neutrino charge radius are one order of magnitude smaller than present experimental limits . on the other hand",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that it is not possible to reach a good sensitivity to neutrino charge radius through astrophysical and cosmological observations and therefore it can be constrained only in terrestrial experiments .    at the low energy scale , besides atomic parity violation  @xcite and moller scattering  @xcite , neutrino - electron scattering experiments are sensitive to the weak mixing angle and they have also been used to search for neutrino effective charge radius .",
    "searches for a non - zero neutrino magnetic moments have also been a challenge in this kind of experiments  @xcite .",
    "recently , the need for a precise measurement of the weak mixing angle at low energies has been encouraged by the nutev collaboration  @xcite , in which a @xmath4 deviation of the weinberg angle from the standard model prediction was found in deep inelastic neutrino scattering .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new limit on the weak mixing angle , @xmath5 , and on the electron neutrino effective charge radius , @xmath6 , obtained from the combined analysis of all available low energy ( anti)neutrino - electron elastic scattering experiments .",
    "we have analyzed all available measurements of the ( anti)neutrino - electron scattering from the following reactor and accelerator experiments : first measurement of neutrino - electron scattering made by reines , gurr and sobel ( irvine )  @xcite , the kurchatov institute group at the krasnoyarsk reactor  @xcite , the group from gatchina at the rovno reactor  @xcite , munu at the bugey reactor  @xcite , lampf  @xcite and lsnd  @xcite .",
    "we havent included into our analysis the recent reactor neutrino results from texono  @xcite and gemma  @xcite experiments , which have put very strong limits on neutrino magnetic moments , @xmath7 and @xmath8 at 90% cl , respectively .",
    "both experiments are working at very low energy thresholds searching for neutrino magnetic moments and are not yet sensitive to the weak mixing angle and neutrino charge radius .",
    "the discussion of theoretical and experimental issues on muon- and tau - neutrino effective charge radii  @xcite is also out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we derive limits to the weak mixing angle and to the neutrino charge radius , in section iii we discuss future perspectives of precise measurements at reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "the summary is presented in section iv .",
    "the differential weak cross section for electron ( anti)neutrino scattering off electron is given by @xmath9\\,,\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the incoming neutrino energy , @xmath11 is the recoil electron energy .",
    "the vector and axial weak couplings are given as @xmath12 and @xmath13 for neutrinos , while in the case of anti - neutrinos @xmath14 .",
    "we will concentrate first in the determination of the weak mixing angle from ( anti)neutrino electron scattering experiments and we will discuss the neutrino charge radius in detail afterwards . to extract the allowed region for the weak mixing angle from the experimental data we have done a @xmath15 analysis ( details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for each experiment and then we have performed a global fit . in particular , we have consider two different @xmath16 experiments , lampf and lsnd . in both cases we have confronted the theoretical cross section with the reported measurement to obtain our value of @xmath5 .",
    "we also considered the experimental results reported in four different reactor experiments . in this case",
    "we compute the total antineutrino cross section @xmath17 with @xmath18 the neutrino energy spectra and @xmath19 the detector energy resolution function .",
    "we use an anti - neutrino energy spectrum given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the abundance of @xmath22u ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24pu ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26pu ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28u ( @xmath29 ) in the reactor , @xmath30 is the corresponding neutrino energy spectrum which we take from the parametrization given in  @xcite , with the appropriate fuel composition . for energies below @xmath31  mev",
    "there are only theoretical calculations for the antineutrino spectrum which we take from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the case of the irvine experiment ( that reports two energy bins ) we prefer to use the neutrino energy spectrum used by the experimentalists at that time  @xcite . with this cross section evaluation",
    "we can perform a @xmath15 analysis either comparing with the expected number of events , for the case of the munu collaboration , or with the reported cross section in the rest of the experimental results .",
    "we neglect correlations between experiments ; this is a good approximation as the only possible correlation comes from the reactor neutrino energy spectrum , estimated to be less than 2%  @xcite , small in view of the statistical errors .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sin ] .",
    "the minimum @xmath15 was found to be @xmath32 . as an additional check of our global result",
    "we have also computed the predicted allowed values of the weak mixing angle excluding one single experiment at a time from our global fit . in all the cases the results are similar .",
    "the present analysis of a weak mixing angle generalizes the recent result @xmath33  @xcite by adding the data from the lampf collaboration  @xcite and from the krasnoyarsk reactor  @xcite .     for weak mixing angle obtained from all discussed @xmath16 and @xmath34 scattering experiments",
    "are plotted .",
    "the contribution of each experiment to the @xmath35 is also shown . ]    from the global fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sin ] we have derived a new value on the weak mixing angle in the low energy range ( below 100  mev ) : @xmath36 this value is 1.45 standard deviations larger than the value of the weak mixing angle obtained from a global fit to electroweak measurements without neutrino - nucleon scattering data , @xmath37  @xcite , that will be used in our numerical calculations of the neutrino charge radius .    the obtained precision of the weak mixing angle in our analysis is about 10% which is close to the expected sensitivities of several proposals aiming to detect neutrinos in the same low energy range  @xcite .",
    "the result  ( [ eq : weak - angle ] ) is not competitive with the current best measurements at low energies obtained from atomic parity violation  @xcite and from moller scattering by slac e158  @xcite which have a precision better than 1% .",
    "however , it is derived from a different channel and it could therefore give new information about other effects , such as the electron neutrino effective charge radius .    the gauge - invariant process - independent expression for the standard model neutrino charge radius has been derived in one - loop approximation in refs  @xcite @xmath38\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the @xmath40-boson mass and @xmath41 denote the lepton masses for @xmath42 .",
    "a numerical evaluation gives the value for the electron neutrino charge radius squared  @xcite @xmath43    besides the standard tree - level amplitude and the @xmath44 contribution , one should keep in mind that the full neutrino - electron scattering amplitude in one - loop approximation contains additional terms  @xcite : the photon-@xmath45 mixing term and the box diagrams involving @xmath40 and @xmath45 bosons .",
    "therefore , in a single process experiment like the one considered in our paper , one can not separate and measure different contributions .",
    "potentially this can be done by combining data from several neutrino - electron and neutrino - neutrino scattering processes as it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider therefore an effective approach and , following previous literature  @xcite , we denote the vector coupling as @xmath46 where @xmath47 contains all the contributions discussed above .",
    "the expression translates into an effective displacement in the value of the weak mixing angle @xmath48 with the radiative correction @xmath49  @xmath50  ) that implies a definition of @xmath51 smaller by a factor two . ] . in the last expression we have taken the fine structure constant , @xmath52 , and the fermi coupling constant , @xmath53 , as reported by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "as previously referred , @xmath54 is the value of the weak mixing angle without taking into account the contribution from @xmath47 .     for electron neutrino charge radius , @xmath47 in units of @xmath55 , obtained from all discussed @xmath16 and @xmath34 scattering experiments",
    "is plotted .",

    "[ fig : necr ] .",
    "the obtained allowed region for the electron neutrino effective charge radius is @xmath57 or @xmath58 for one standard deviation .",
    "although the precision of present experimental measurements is not enough to conclude that electron neutrino charge radius is non - zero , better sensitivity is expected in future proposed experiments and they will be discussed below .    in table",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can conclude , that from the measurement of the weak mixing angle with 1% resolution it is possible to find a strong evidence for electron neutrino charge radius , which is estimated theoretically to be of the order of @xmath61  @xmath60  @xcite .",
