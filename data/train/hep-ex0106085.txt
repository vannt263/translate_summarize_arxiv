    "the exclusive production of baryon - antibaryon pairs in the collision of two quasi real photons can be used to test qcd predictions .",
    "the photons are emitted by the beam electrons and positrons and the @xmath0 are produced in the process @xmath4 .",
    "the application of qcd to exclusive two - photon reactions is based on the work of brodsky and lapage  @xcite . according to their formalism the process is factorized into a non - perturbative part , the hadronic wave function of the final state , and a perturbative part . a calculation based on this ansatz",
    "@xcite uses a specific model of the proton s three - quark wave function by chernyak and zhitnitnitsky  @xcite .",
    "this calculation predicts cross - sections that are about one order of magnitude smaller than the existing experimental results  @xcite , for two - photon center - of - mass energies @xmath5 greater than @xmath6 .    to model non - perturbative effects",
    ", the introduction of diquarks has been proposed  @xcite . within this model",
    ", baryons are viewed as systems of quarks and diquarks , quasi - elementary constituents which partially survive medium - hard collision .",
    "their composite nature is taken into account by diquark form factors .",
    "recent studies  @xcite have extended the investigation of exclusive reactions within the diquark model to two - photon reactions  @xcite .",
    "the quark - diquark model works rather well for exclusive reactions in the space - like region  @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the integrated cross - sections for the processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the angular region @xmath7 , @xmath8 here is the the polar angle of the @xmath9 centre - of - mass system ( cms ) , show a good agreement with the existing data described in sec .  [ sec:3.0 ] and",
    "[ sec:4.0 ] in this paper .",
    "the @xmath2 monte carlo studies for pep - n are given in sec .",
    "[ sec:5.0 ] .",
    "the two - photon process is a two step process : first both incident particles emit virtual photons with squared masses @xmath10 , @xmath11 and energies @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "next the two photons produce the final state @xmath14 .",
    "the first step , the @xmath15 vertex , is completely specified by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ; the second step , @xmath16 , is not rigorously calculable for an hadronic final state @xmath14 .",
    "an approximation for the cross - section can be obtained if the essential features of both @xmath15 vertices are given : the @xmath17-dependence from the photon propagator together with the @xmath18 dependence characteristic of bremsstrahlung .",
    "a natural way of differentiating between final states @xmath14 produced by the two - photon process and those produced by the @xmath1 annihilation process is the observation of a scattered electron , called `` tag '' .",
    "depending on the number of electrons detected ( zero , one or two ) events are referred to as no - tag , single - tag or double - tag , respectively . in a no - tag event",
    "the scattered electrons go undetected in the beam pipe .",
    "consequently , the final - state @xmath14 coming from the reaction @xmath19 has a small transverse momentum .",
    "if @xmath14 then decays into two charged particles , usually these particles are detected at small angles with respect to the beam .",
    "they are back - to - back in the @xmath20 plane , but in the @xmath21 plane they are not .",
    "the @xmath9 center of mass is moving and boosted along the beam axis .",
    "the higher the momentum , the closer are the produced particles to the beam direction .",
    "this feature , combined with the typically low mass of two - photon produced final states , severely limits the detection efficiency which rarely exceeds @xmath22 .      in the perturbative qcd scheme , also called hard - scattering - picture ( hsp ) see refs .",
    "@xcite , an exclusive hadronic process , @xmath23 , to leading order in the inverse of the large momentum transfer in the transverse direction , @xmath24 , is described by an exclusive hadronic amplitude @xmath25 .",
    "this amplitude can be expressed as a convolution of process - independent distribution amplitudes , @xmath26 , with the elementary scattering amplitude , @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude ] ) separates the hard - scattering amplitude from the bound state dynamics , namely the short - range from the long - range phenomena .",
    "one important phenomenological consequence coming from this factorization formula is the _ dimensional counting rules_. by ignoring logarithmic corrections  @xcite , the dimensional counting rules predict the following power - law behavior of the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 = baryons ) cross - section at fixed angles : @xmath32 the scaling law is valid only at sufficiently large @xmath33 when @xmath34 is small enough to make the feynman diagram expansion meaningful .    another important consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude ] ) is the _ hadron helicity conservation rules_. for each exclusive reaction @xmath23 , the sum of the initial helicities equals the sum of the final ones  @xcite : @xmath35    the _ dimensional counting rules _ are in good agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "the _ hadron helicity conservation _ rule has given some troubles when its consequences are compared with the existing spin data in exclusive hadronic reactions .",
    "an example of a typical problem that raises from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : mot8 ] ) , comes from the @xmath36 and @xmath37 decays into @xmath38 , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the introduction of diquarks at this point may have two positive consequences .",
    "the first consequence is that it modifies the dimensional counting rules of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sminuss ] ) by effectively decreasing the number of constituents to be taken into account in the process studied .",
    "the power law behavior of the cross - section for e.g. the @xmath2 process  @xcite is then given by : @xmath39    the second consequence of diquarks as constituents has to do with the violation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mot8 ] ) .",
    "this violation can only come from couplings between gluons and those partons that allow helicity flips , such as vector diquarks . again , at very large @xmath40 values , if a diquark resolves into two quarks , the helicity - conservation rule is recovered , while at @xmath40 values where the diquarks act as elementary objects helicity conservation can be strongly violated , which solves the quark model spin problems .    from all the applications analyzed ,",
    "see summary given in ref .",
    "@xcite , it emerges that diquarks seem to be a useful phenomenological way of modeling higher - order and non - perturbative effects in order to achieve a better description of many hadronic exclusive reactions . nevertheless , the treatment of exclusive processes in the framework of constituent models and perturbative qcd is really far from being understood in a unique and well defined computational scheme .",
    "there are recent applications of the quark - diquark model that concern the class of reactions @xmath41",
    "@xcite , where b represents an octet baryon ( @xmath42 , etc . ) . in the older calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath2 annihilation has been computed in the scheme of refs .",
    "diquarks are in this work considered as quasi - elementary constituents , all the masses are neglected except those of the scalar diquarks in the propagator . within the new calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , baryon - mass effects are instead taken into account , and the cross - sections have been computed down to energy values of @xmath43 . at these values",
    "the diquark model starts to loose its validity , but this is where most of the experiments have their bulk of data .",
    "there are recent studies for the exclusive @xmath2 cross - section measurements using the opal data at lep2 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , see ref .",
    "the @xmath2 events are selected in opal by applying the following main set of cuts :    1 .",
    "exactly two oppositely charged tracks ; the tracks must have at least 20 hits in the central jet chamber .",
    "the selected tracks must have a minimal distance , @xmath46 , of at most @xmath47  cm from the beam axis .",
    "2 .   for each track",
    "the polar angle must be in the range @xmath48 and the transverse momentum @xmath49 must be larger than @xmath50 .",
    "these cuts ensure a high trigger efficiency and good particle identification .",
    "3 .   the polar angle in the @xmath2 cms has to be in the range @xmath7 .",
    "data and monte carlo events must pass a defined trigger condition based on a combination of track and time - of - flight triggers .",
    "exclusive two - particle final states are selected by rejecting events if the transverse component of the momentum sum squared of the two tracks , @xmath51 , is larger than @xmath52 .",
    "the large background from other exclusive processes , mainly the production of @xmath1 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 pairs , is reduced by particle identification using the specific energy loss cuts , @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath56 probabilities of the tracks must be consistent with the @xmath57 and @xmath58 hypothesis .    within the applied @xmath7 cut , the typical opal detection efficiency is about @xmath59 at high values of @xmath5 and about @xmath60 at low @xmath5 .",
    "similar values of detection efficiency are also found in other experiments : e.g. the tasso  @xcite detection efficiency , was found to be @xmath61 at @xmath62 , @xmath63 at @xmath6 and @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
