    "the _ far  ultraviolet  spectroscopic  explorer _ ( @xmath0 ) satellite ( moos et al . 2000 ) has provided an opportunity to study populations of early - type stars in the milky way and magellanic clouds in the 900 - 1200  region .",
    "spectral atlases of @xmath0 observations of o and early b - type stars have recently been presented by pellerin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and walborn et al .",
    "the principal scientific motivation for such observations is the comparison of stellar winds from early - type stars in different metallicity ( @xmath6 ) environments .",
    "the predicted theoretical dependence of radiatively driven winds from massive stars is well documented , such that @xmath7(z )  @xmath8 ( kudritzki , pauldrach & puls , 1987 ; vink , de koter & lamers , 2001 ) ; observationally this has yet to be firmly established .",
    "the precise sensitivity of mass - loss to metallicity for early - type stars is keenly sought as it is a necessary ingredient for stellar evolution models ( and in turn evolutionary synthesis models ) .    towards this goal",
    ", we initiated a program to obtain high - quality optical observations with the uv - visual echelle spectograph ( uves ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) for the magellanic cloud targets in our @xmath0 principal investigator programmes .",
    "we have focused particularly on the clouds to avoid contamination associated with the high column densities of h@xmath9 typical of sightlines to galactic ob - type stars ( e.g. , pellerin et al .",
    "2002 ) and to minimize the effect of uncertainties in the distances to the targets on the atmospheric analysis . at the same time",
    ", so - called `` unified '' stellar atmosphere models are now available which allow for the spherical extension of supergiants and treat line blanketing by metal species in a reasonably thorough manner .",
    "crowther et al . ( 2002 ; hereafter paper i ) presented the first study of the present series for four magellanic cloud o - type supergiants , employing the model atmosphere code cmfgen ( hillier & miller , 1998 ) .",
    "these extreme supergiants ( all were of luminosity class ia@xmath10 ) were specifically chosen to test previously adopted stellar temperatures for o - type stars , for which fullerton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) had questioned the previous plane - parallel , unblanketed results ( e.g. , vacca et al .",
    "indeed , substantially lower temperatures were derived for these extreme supergiants .",
    "the combination of very strong stellar winds together with metal line blanketing led to temperatures 1520@xmath11 lower than those from plane - parallel models composed solely of hydrogen and helium .",
    "downward revisions were also found for galactic o - type dwarfs ( martins et al .",
    "2002 ) and supergiants in the galactic cluster cyg ob2 ( herrero et al .",
    "2002 ) . for our second paper",
    "we have therefore chosen to study o - type stars with luminosity classes in the range ii to ia@xmath10 , to better address the question of the stellar temperature scale .",
    "we have also extended our sample to include early b - type supergiants , thereby providing an overlap between paper i and the recent results of trundle et al .",

    "i , cno abundances of extreme o - type supergiants were found to differ greatly from those inferred from nebular and stellar studies in the magellanic clouds .",
    "nitrogen was strongly enhanced , with carbon ( and oxygen ) moderately depleted , suggestive of mixing of unprocessed and cno - processed material at their surfaces .",
    "these results were supported by a companion study by hillier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which used identical techniques .",
    "they found unprocessed cno abundances for av69 [ oc7.5iii((f ) ) ] and partially cno - processed material in av83 ( o7iaf@xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , morphologically normal ob stars appear to show evidence for moderate levels of chemical processing .",
    "this new study allows us to examine cno abundances in less extreme supergiants .",
    "the issue of clumping in early - type stars was raised in paper  i and by hillier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in order to reconcile the optical h@xmath4 and far - uv pv",
    "@xmath51118 - 28 wind diagnostics , either clumped winds or a reduced phosphorus abundance was required .",

    "the question of clumping , and hence reduced mass - loss rates for ob - type stars , is an important one , although the uncertain abundance of phosphorus in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a major limitation .",
    "in contrast , we shall suggest that siv @xmath51062 - 73 is an analogue of pv @xmath51118 - 28 amongst late o and early b - type supergiants , for which the ism elemental abundance is well known ( e.g. , russell & dopita 1992 ) .",

    "new digital data for av456 are presented in figure [ class ] .",

    "note the strong similarity between the two uves spectra , particularly the ratio of he  ii @xmath124200 to he  i @xmath124144 and the intensity of the he  ii @xmath124686 absorption ; for these reasons we classify av456 as o9.5 ibw .",
    "morphologically , the on - type star in our sample , hde269896 ( on9.7ia@xmath10 ) is very similar to sk@xmath1666@xmath17169 ( o9.7ia@xmath10 ) from paper i. digital data for hde269896 were published by walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) and for sk@xmath1666@xmath17169 by fitzpatrick ( 1991 ) .",
    "a useful illustration of the on / oc phenomenon in high - quality digital data is given by walborn & howarth ( 2000 ) .",
    "the on classification for hde269896 arises because of the approximately equal n  iii @xmath124640 and c  iii @xmath124650 intensities , compared to the `` normal '' case in sk@xmath1666@xmath17169 , where the c  iii absorption is much stronger ; the n  iii @xmath124097 line is also stronger with respect to h@xmath18 in hde269896 . we note that the peak intensity of the h@xmath4 emission for hde269896 is larger than that for sk@xmath1666@xmath17169 , suggesting a greater mass - loss rate .",

    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the reddening in the direction of av456 is much larger than that for the other smc targets ( see table [ targets1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 spectrum of av456 contains such significant molecular hydrogen absorption that it is essentially devoid of useful stellar features apart from the c  iii @xmath121176 multiplet .",
    "av456 was observed with @xmath1 , however this was at low dispersion ( lores ) meaning that our far - uv and uv coverage for this star is relatively limited in comparison to the rest of the sample .",
    "a comparison between unblanketed , plane - parallel results and line - blanketed , spherical results for four o - type supergiants was presented in paperi ; further comparisons are not undertaken here . in contrast , bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) demonstrated good agreement between _ fully _ line - blanketed , plane - parallel models computed with tlusty and cmfgen models for o - type dwarfs in the smc , for which the effects of the stellar wind on the emergent spectrum are substantially smaller .",
    "our methods for the determination of intrinsic parameters were largely identical to the approach taken in paper i and by hillier et al .",
    "we varied the mass - loss rate and the velocity law ( as characterized by the exponent @xmath19 ) until the h@xmath4 profile was best reproduced in terms of intensity and morphology , subsequently adjusting the stellar temperature to match the intensities of the he  ii @xmath124200/4542 and he  i lines .",
    "however , he  ii becomes exceptionally weak for the b - type supergiants in our sample so the relative intensities of si  iv @xmath124089 and si  iii @xmath124553 - 68 - 75 lines were used instead as primary temperature indicators for these stars .",
    "the alternative temperature diagnostics were generally in excellent agreement .",
    "terminal velocities , @xmath20 , were primarily determined from @xmath21 ( e.g. , prinja , barlow , & howarth , 1990 ) of the n  iii @xmath12990 doublet ( largely uncontaminated from molecular hydrogen ) , with consideration to other saturated lines in the far - uv .",
    "terminal velocities for each of our targets are listed in table [ results ] .",
    "a firm determination of the helium content of extreme supergiants is extremely difficult ( e.g. , hillier et al . 2003 ) so , following the arguments from paper i , the he abundance ( by number ) was fixed for our most luminous targets at he / h  @xmath22  0.2 . for the less luminous supergiants ,",
    "we initially assume he / h  @xmath22  0.2 , though we have explored alternative abundances .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , helium abundance differences of @xmath30.1 are not found to affect the derived temperatures significantly , although an additional uncertainty is introduced into the derived mass - loss rate .",
    "cno abundances were varied to fit the relevant optical lines , with a typical accuracy of @xmath30.3 dex .",
    "solar cno abundances were taken from grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) except oxygen , which was set at log(o / h)+12 = 8.66 ( asplund , 2003 ) .",
    "abundances of other metallic elements were fixed at 0.4@xmath23 ( lmc ) and 0.2@xmath23 ( smc ) , e.g. , russell & dopita ( 1992 ) . the primary diagnostic line used for determination of the nitrogen abundance was n  iii @xmath124097 , with consideration of n  ii @xmath123995 and the n  iii @xmath124640 blend which are less sensitive to abundance changes .",
    "oxygen and carbon abundances were also determined from consideration of the optical lines ; o  ii @xmath12441517 and @xmath1240694092 provided useful constraints on the oxygen abundance , whilst c  ii @xmath124267 together with c  iii @xmath12464751 ( blended with o  ii ) were used for carbon .",
    "another physical parameter that affects the analysis is the rotational velocity of the star .",
    "this redistributes the flux in a given line , with the net result that peak absorption and emission intensities are reduced .",

    "demonstrates a wide range of behaviour , i.e. , from strong absorption ( e.g. , av70 , see figure [ blue_2 ] ) to strong emission ( hde269896 ) .",

    ", the behaviour of the model @xmath124686 profiles suggests that , for this line , we are perhaps limited by the adoption of a depth independent photospheric turbulence .",
    "uv and far - uv comparisons are generally successful , as we shall discuss later .",

    "the radial velocity of the he  i line is more in keeping with the blue data ( see table [ targets1 ] ) , i.e. , the peak of the h@xmath4 emission is significantly discrepant from its expected wavelength in the @xmath30 spectrum .",

    "we show the s  iv and p  v region for av372 in more detail .",
    "in contrast to phosphorus , the present day ism abundance of sulphur in the magellanic clouds is well known from both hii regions ( e.g. , russell & dopita 1992 ) and stars ( e.g. , rolleston et al . 2003 ) . with",
    "the sulphur abundance fixed , a moderately clumped wind leads to less discrepant emission p - cygni emission and the morphology of the absorption components are better matched .",
    "the role of clumping in the winds of wolf - rayet stars is well documented ( e.g. , moffat et al . 1988 ; hillier 1991 ) ; only more recently have such effects been considered in o and b - type stars .",
    "we conclude that it is likely that the winds of o and early b - type supergiants are clumped , with the best spectroscopic evidence revealed by unsaturated lines of dominant ions in the far - uv @xmath0 region .",
    "massa et al . (",
    "2003 ) arrived at a similar conclusion based on their line profile analyses of @xmath0 observations of o - type stars in the lmc .",
    "additional supporting evidence was offered by hillier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who noted that unclumped models predict asymmetries in some uv photospheric lines that are not seen in the observations ; these discrepancies are reduced by the inclusion of clumping .",
    "intensive spectroscopic monitoring of both optical emission features ( eversberg et al . 1998 ) and uv lines ( prinja , massa , & fullerton , 2002 ) have already indicated that winds in early type stars are highly structured ; hydrodynamic models ( owocki et al .",
    "1988 ) and x - ray spectroscopy ( miller et al .",
    "2002 ) also suggest wind clumping .",
    "for seven of the eight program stars , we obtain reasonably good agreement between the synthetic far - uv , uv and optical spectra and observations ; for av235 this is not the case .",
    "following our usual method , i.e. , selecting a mass - loss rate from h@xmath4 and temperature from photospheric helium or silicon diagnostics we derive the following parameters : @xmath31  @xmath22  24.5kk , @xmath52 , @xmath53yr@xmath35 with a @xmath54 velocity exponent . the synthetic spectrum from this model is compared to observations in figure [ av235_opt ] ( to permit a clearer comparison of the predicted profiles the 100  @xmath26  offset between he  i @xmath126678 and h@xmath4 has been removed ) .",
    "for this set of parameters , we obtained cno abundances of @xmath36(n / n@xmath37 ) = 2.3 , @xmath36(o / o@xmath37 ) = 0.2 and @xmath36(c / c@xmath37 ) = 0.02 .",
    "the helium lines are well fit by this model , as are the si  iii and iv lines .",
    "however , it is clear that the predicted p cygni emission profiles for h@xmath19 , h@xmath55 are far too strong in emission , in spite of h@xmath4 matching well ; clumping is not able to resolve these differences .    turning to the uv , many of the wind features are again over - estimated ( see figure [ av235_uv ] ) ; they too suggest a much lower mass - loss rate and/or higher ionization than that obtained from fits to h@xmath4 .",
    "for example ,",
    "n  ii and al  iii are predicted strongly in emission ( yet such features are not observed in b supergiants earlier than b0.7 , e.g. , walborn , parker , & nichols , 1995 ) whilst the predicted c  iv is too weak .",
    "we therefore calculated models which reproduced the usual optical diagnostics , except that h@xmath55 was now selected as the mass - loss diagnostic . in this case",
    "( shown in figure  [ av235_opt2 ] ) a significantly higher stellar temperature was required to reproduce the photospheric he and si lines , i.e. , @xmath31  @xmath22  27.5kk , @xmath56 , @xmath57yr@xmath35 with an adopted @xmath58 ( `` av235 h@xmath55 '' in table [ results ] ) .",
    "the line wings of h@xmath55 are now well matched ( though the predicted core absorption is too large ) and the overall optical agreement is equal to the h@xmath4 model with the exception that this line and h@xmath19 are now severely underestimated .",
    "a consequence of the hotter model is that many of the uv features are in better agreement with the observations , namely p  iv , n  ii , si  iii , c  iv and al  iii as shown in figure  [ av235_uv2 ] .",
    "this solution appears to be more representative for the true metal ionization balance , although the theoretical s  iv and si  iv profiles are still strongly overpredicted ; clumped models help slightly but do not resolve the problems .",
    "both the intensity and morphology of the h@xmath4 emission agree in our vlt - uves and anu spectra .",
    "additionally , the feature is identical in a caspec echelle spectrum taken using the eso 3.6-m telescope in oct .",
    "1991 ( dr .",
    "daniel lennon , private communication ) , i.e. , there is no obvious evidence for significant h@xmath4 variability .",
    "thus , clumping aside , the h@xmath55/far - uv and h@xmath4 wind diagnostics indicate a discrepancy in mass - loss of at least a factor of two .",
    "ultimately , all optical diagnostics for av235 can be reproduced in the case of a clumped , weak wind at @xmath31  = 27.5kk , with the exception of h@xmath4 .",
    "it would seem that in this case at least our assumption of spherical symmetry is not valid .",
    "derived cno abundances ( by number ) for our present sample are given in table  [ results_cno ] , together with those from paper  i and hillier et al .",
    "we also include hii region abundances from russell & dopita ( 1992 ) , plus more recent stellar abundances in the smc from venn ( 1999 ) .",

    "( 1991 ) , for which a lower temperature of 25kk was obtained .",

    "[ results_cno ] we also present new results for sk@xmath1666@xmath17169 .",
    "in the course of this work it became apparent that the source of the he  ii @xmath124686 discrepancy for this target in paper 1 was due mainly to the large adopted turbulent velocity in the model atmosphere calculation , to which @xmath124686 is very sensitive .",
    "this discovery led to revisions in the adopted parameters of sk@xmath1666@xmath17169 ( a hotter model of 27.5kk is now preferred ) , which in turn affects the derived abundances .",
    "this now enables us to make a fully consistent comparison between the two o9.7-type stars .",
    "walborn ( 1976 ) suggested that it is the obc - type stars that are least evolved , rather than the morphologically normal and obn - types .",
    "we would therefore expect normal supergiants to show evidence for partial cno processing . in general ( e.g. , paper  i ) `` normal '' o and b - type supergiants exhibit evidence of nitrogen enrichment , together with carbon and oxygen depletion . in the current sample , this is especially evident for hde269896 in which c / n=0.008 , versus c / n=0.075 in sk@xmath1666@xmath17169 ( and c / n=8 for the ism ) , i.e. , hde269698 appears to be more fully processed .",

    "qualitative evidence of rotationally - induced mixing was given by howarth & smith ( 2001 ) who found that on - type main sequence stars were drawn from a more rapidly rotating population than those with morphologically normal spectra .",
    "more recently , the enhanced nitrogen abundances found in paper i and in av83 ( hillier et al , 2003 ) were attributed to rotational mixing , in combination with the effects of cno processing .",
    "we obtain significantly enhanced nitrogen abundances for all of our targets . when compared to the abundances from rusell & dopita ( 1992 ) , the n / c ratios for the current sample represent enhancements by factors of about 100 .",
    "enhanced nitrogen abundances were found by maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) in their high - mass , fast - rotating ( @xmath24sin@xmath25  =  300 @xmath26 ) models , however it seems unlikely that our results are solely attributable to rapid rotation . indeed if high rotational velocities were implicated , our targets would have `` spun down '' more quickly than the maeder & meynet models ( see their table  1 ) .",

    "this result is consistent with the temperatures found from recent line - blanketed , non - lte analyses of early b - type smc supergiants by trundle et al .",
    "as table  [ table - teff ] indicates , temperatures of stars with strong winds ( h@xmath4 in emission ) , deviate more from standard ( plane - parallel ) calibrations than those with weak winds ( h@xmath4 in absorption ) such as av488 , as might be anticipated",
    ".    published temperature calibrations have always been monotonic in nature , i.e. , @xmath31  decreases with later spectral types , ( e.g. , vacca et al .",
    "1996 ) , but this is only the case when one separates extreme supergiants ( typically ia@xmath66 luminosity class ) from normal supergiants ( typically ib , ii ) . therefore , considering the h@xmath4 model for the extreme b0ia supergiant av235 together with av488 ( b0.5  ia ) , it is the high wind density of the former and low wind density of the latter which conspire to upset the conventional downward sequence .",
    "the peculiarity of this situation is reduced when considering the h@xmath55 model ; a hotter temperature is required to match the optical spectrum when a lower wind density ( i.e. , smaller mass - loss rate ) is required .",
    "similar arguments have already been made recently by herrero et al .",
    ".    further work on a yet larger magellanic cloud sample including @xmath0 and uves observations , spanning early - type dwarfs and later b - type supergiants is ongoing and should further elucidate the temperature scale for early - type stars .",
    "similarly , a larger study of galactic early b supergiants is currently in progress which confirms the present temperature scale for b supergiants with or without strong winds ( crowther et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the wind - momentum - luminosity relationship ( wlr , puls et al .",
    "1996 ) , relating @xmath7 , @xmath20 and @xmath67 to stellar luminosity has been claimed to provide a means by which distances to galaxies containing oba - type supergiants may be obtained ( e.g. , kudritzki et al .",
    "indeed , in external galaxies b - type supergiants are generally considered to be more useful than o - types as they are visually brighter .",
    "there are two direct consequences of the present results ( together with those from paper  i ) regarding the calibration of the wlr .",
    "firstly , as a direct consequence of lower temperatures from our blanketed model atmospheres , derived luminosities are lower ( recall figure  19 from paper  i ) . also , given the indications that ob - type winds are clumped , there will be a second correction to the absolute value of the wind - momentum .",
    "unfortunately , determining clumping factors remains a formidable challenge .",
    "kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discuss differences in wind driving lines between o , b and a - type supergiants , such that each will possess different scaling laws ( see also kudritzki & puls 2000 ) .",
    "we therefore present our current ( unclumped ) results in figure  [ wlr ] together with calibrations from ( unblanketed ) models of galactic ob - type supergiants obtained by kudritzki & puls .",
    "we present two values for av235 given the contradictory mass - loss diagnostics for this particular star .",

    "( 2002 ) provide an updated calibration for galactic o - type supergiants using blanketed model results , with a similar slope to kudritzki & puls for high luminosities , but @xmath30.2 dex lower for moderate luminosities",
    ".    the magellanic cloud stars from our present sample generally lie within a factor of two of the kudritzki & puls calibration , in spite of the lower luminosities as a result of blanketing and ( predicted ) weaker winds as a result of lower metallicity . at first glance",
    "this is rather puzzling .",
    "however , we include in our sample the most extreme ob - type supergiants in the magellanic clouds , such that they will provide rather poor templates with which galactic supergiants should be compared .",

    "work towards this goal is presently underway by various groups .",
    "clumping , with volume filling factors of order 10% , in which mass - loss rates are actually a factor of three times lower , would serve to reduce the calibration by 0.5 dex .",
    "the ( unclumped ) mass - loss rates for our sample are compared with the theoretical predictions for our stars from the recipes of vink et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in figure [ vink ] ; since the methods are identical , results from paper  i and hillier et al .",

    "this arises because some of our stars ( most notably av235 , with the lowest predicted mass - loss rate ) lie between the two bi - stability jumps . in these cases",
    "the jump is recalculated by vink s routine , which due to the metallicity dependence ( see vink et al .",
    "15 ) , leads to different coefficients when calculating the predicted rates ; similar problems were encountered by trundle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the first point to note from the figure is that the observationally derived mass - loss rates are generally higher for our lmc stars than those in the smc ; this is simply a selection effect of the current overall sample .",
    "four of the five lmc stars are classified as ia@xmath10 , whereas the smc stars are generally less extreme .",
    "this is unfortunate as it makes it difficult to perform meaningful comparisons between the two metallicities .",
    "a second comment is that the theoretical results at @xmath68 ( i.e. , assuming no @xmath6 dependence ) are qualitatively a better match to the observed mass - loss rates than those taking metallicity into account .",
    "similarly , for three early b - type supergiants in the smc , trundle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also found that the observationally derived mass - loss rates were larger than those predicted for @xmath69 = 0.2 .",
    "vink et al .",
    "used different sets of stellar atmosphere models and thus no physical significance should be attached to these results at the current time .",
    "they do however reinforce the need for further theoretical efforts in the sense that the `` recipe '' to predict stellar - mass loss rates gives different values to the analyses here and to those by trundle et al .",
    "similarly , if one is to reliably test the dependence of stellar mass - loss rates with metallicity , it is clear that we require a large , @xmath70 observational study of early - type stars in the clouds .",
    "we have studied a sample of lmc and smc late o and early b supergiants based on modern line - blanketed , spherical models plus extensive @xmath0 ( far - uv ) , @xmath1 ( uv ) and uves ( visual ) observations . in general , we find excellent agreement between alternative optical temperature diagnostics ( e.g. , he and si ) with h@xmath4 derived mass - loss rates .",
    "adopting homogeneous models , some uv wind features are systematically too strong .",
    "the uv discrepancies are reduced if ob winds are clumped .",
    "pv @xmath51118 - 1128 was identified as a useful probe of clumping in o supergiants in paper  i , unless phosphorus is depleted relative to other elements in the magellanic clouds . in the present study , siv @xmath51063 - 1072 appears to offer an equivalent probe in early b - type supergiants , with the additional benefit that the ism sulphur abundance is well known ( russell & dopita 1992 ) .",
    "we conclude that winds in ob - type stars are at least moderately clumped .",
    "this leads to lower derived mass - loss rates than otherwise , which scale with the adopted filling - factor , ( with @xmath71 , @xmath7 is reduced by a factor of @xmath33 ) .",
    "av235 ( b0iaw ) is peculiar in the current sample in that it has inconsistent optical ( balmer line ) , uv and far - uv wind features .",
    "all diagnostics indicate a relatively weak ( and clumped ) wind for av235 with the exception of h@xmath4 .",
    "stellar temperatures for o and early b - type supergiants are generally 24kk lower than recent calibrations based on unblanketed , plane - parallel models .",
    "supergiants with extreme ( typically ia@xmath66 ) winds are more greatly affected , such that there is expected to be different spectral type ",
    "temperature calibrations for ob supergiants , depending on whether h@xmath4 is in emission . reduced temperatures consequently indicate lower luminosities , with impact upon ionizing fluxes ( recall figure  13 from herrero et al .",
    "2002 ) , and wind - momentum luminosity calibrations .",
    "we also investigate cno abundances for ob supergiants . as in paper",
    "i , `` normal '' ob supergiants are found to have partially processed abundances , i.e. , log(n / c)@xmath31 versus log(n / c)@xmath72 for hii regions .",
    "although such large nitrogen enrichments were found in the fast - rotating evolutionary models from maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) , it seems unlikely that rapid rotation is solely responsible and that mixing is perhaps more effective than previously thought at more moderate velocities .",
    "a differential analysis of hde269896 ( on9.7ia@xmath66 ) versus sk@xmath73169 ( o9.7ia@xmath66 ) indicates even more extreme abundances  nitrogen is further enriched at the expense of carbon and oxygen in the on supergiant .",
    "in contrast , two obc stars exhibit fairly normal cno abundances ; hd  2905 studied here for comparison to the magellanic cloud b - type supergiants , plus av69 investigated by hillier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using identical techniques .",
    "consequently , quantitative models now provide strong evidence for the sequence obc ( normal cno ) @xmath74 ob ( cno partially processed ) @xmath74 obn ( fully cno processed ) originally suggested on from morphological arguments by walborn ( 1976 , 1988 ) and supported by studies of he - contents by smith & howarth ( 1994 ) .",
