    "since the pioneering datta - das proposal of an electronic field - effect transistor in which the current flow is controlled by magnetic means only,@xcite the study of the rashba@xcite spin - orbit interaction in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and quasi - one - dimensional ballistic channels ( quantum wires ) has attracted a lot of interest.@xcite precise tunability of the strength of the rashba coupling has been also experimentally demonstrated in quantum wells.@xcite typically , semiconductor quantum wires are built from two - dimensional electron gases formed at the interface of a semiconductor heterostructure when the lateral motion of electrons is restricted by a transversal confinement potential to effective widths of the order of the de broglie electron wavelength .",
    "for very clean quantum wires ( e.g. , quantum point contacts ) transport is ballistic and conductance is quantized to integer values of @xmath0.@xcite    the presence of impurities or defects in the vicinity of the constriction destroys conductance quantization.@xcite a striking effect arises when the impurity potential is attractive and enables the existence of at least one bound state whose energy is degenerate with the continuum band of propagating states . as a consequence , for energies close to the transition threshold a direct transmission channel can interfere with a wave trajectory that travels across the bound state and this interference is destructive , leading to enhanced backscattering and fano asymmetric lineshapes.@xcite recently , two of us@xcite have demonstrated that a spin - orbit interaction of the rashba type localized in an infinitely long quantum wire plays a role similar to an attractive potential and pronounced dips are seen in numerical simulations of the conductance curves.@xcite it is remarkable that the rashba interaction provides both the attractive potential that supports bound states@xcite and the mixing term that couples the localized and the propagating states.@xcite interestingly , when charging effects are taken into account , coulomb blockade resonances can be tuned directly modulating the strength of the rashba coupling.@xcite    a magnetic field applied in the wire plane leads to zeeman spin splitting of the 1d modes .",
    "evidence of this is shown in the appearance of conductance plateaus at odd multiples of @xmath0.@xcite in the first plateau the current is fully polarized since only one spin species is allowed to propagate . quantum states with",
    "opposite spin are evanescent asymptotically and do not take part in electron transport unless there exist inhomogeneities that give rise to resonances or fano - type interferences in which case evanescent states are crucial .",
    "reference presents a theoretical method to calculate evanescent states in quantum wires with uniform rashba interaction .    to determine the full transmission pattern of a generic quantum wire",
    ", one must first analyze the energy spectrum of the wire . for quantum wires with uniform rashba interaction in the absence of external magnetic fields , free - electron energy bands are parabolas shifted apart for opposite spin directions.@xcite the splitting size is proportional to the spin - orbit interaction strength @xmath1 and in the quasi-1d case the rashba interaction produces anticrossings between bands corresponding to opposite spins and adjacent modes.@xcite moreover , the propagation threshold is shifted , compared to the case with no spin - orbit coupling , down to an energy @xmath2 . in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field , the energy spectrum changes dramatically even for arbitrarily small fields",
    ". the field can be either externally applied or originated from stray fields of the ferromagnets coupled to the wire in the datta - das setup.@xcite it is shown@xcite that the interplay between the magnetic field and the rashba interaction leads to the openings of gaps in the 1d energy bands at small wavenumbers . in a quasi-1d wire",
    "most of the energy dispersions around the gap form energy minima locally in contrast to the maxima encountered in the 1d case.@xcite in those energy windows in which the gap consists of an energy local maximum followed by a local minimum the conductance curves present anomalous steps for chemical potentials within the gap.@xcite    in short , external magnetic fields lead to the formation of energy gaps in the spectrum while local rashba interactions produce fano - type antiresonances due to the formation of quasi - bound states coupled to the channel of direct transmission states .",
    "therefore , we expect a rich interplay between in - plane fields and localized rashba spin - orbit couplings in the transport properties of a ballistic quantum wire .",
    "this paper presents a generic theoretical description of the quantum transmission of an electron subject to zeeman splittings and spatially modulated rashba fields .",
    "we find the occurrence of _ exact _ tranmission zeros in the conductance curves of a zeeman - split wire with local rashba interaction as a function of the fermi energy .",
    "central to the existence of the transmission zeros are the formation of a zeeman gap arising from an in - plane magnetic field and the role of the evanescent states within the rashba region .",
    "in fact , the rashba interaction couples the propagating and evanescent states precisely in the interior of the rashba region . the transmission antiresonances are almost universal , showing a fermi energy with vanishingly small transmission at moderately low magnetic fields .",
    "this might be relevant for applications since it provides two operation points for working transistors ( low and high current states ) .",
    "it is important to stress that these transmission zeros are fundamentally distinct from the suppressed transmission that may take place in a datta - das setup due to spin precession@xcite even in the presence of in - plane magnetic fields.@xcite the antiresonance position can be tuned with a slight change of @xmath1 and are robust against changes of the magnetic field .",

    "the scales used in fig .",
    "[ q1d1 ] are of the same order as in fig .",
    "e.g. , for a confinement strength @xmath211  mev in an inas wire , we obtain @xmath212  @xmath128 m , @xmath213  mev ( @xmath214  mt ) and @xmath215  mev  nm .    when the magnetic field is oriented along the wire as in fig .",
    "[ q1d1 ] , the interference leading to the fano profiles in the transmission is maximal . on the contrary , for transverse orientation",
    "@xmath35 it completely disappears ( see fig .  [ q1d3 ] ) .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec-1d - ang ] in the 1d case , where it was shown that the mixings @xmath216 and @xmath217 vanish for @xmath35 .",
    "the evolution with the zeeman field intensity for the quasi-1d case is shown in fig .",
    "the behavior is again qualitatively similar to the 1d case of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , with the dip evolving towards smaller energies when decreasing the value of @xmath70 .",
    "we also notice that , as predicted by the tight binding result , even for quite small zeeman energies there is a dip in the transmission .",
    "thus far we have considered abrupt interfaces between the normal sides and the rashba region . using the quasi-1d grid calculation we can also address the influence of the smoothness in the transition of the rashba coupling strength from zero to the finite value @xmath1 , which is closer to reality .",
    "we model each interface using a fermi function with a diffusivity @xmath218 , @xmath219\\ ; .\\ ] ] figure [ sig ] shows the results for different values of @xmath218 .",
    "the transmission curve coincides with the abrupt interface limit when @xmath220 while for increasing @xmath218 the interface becomes smoother but the transmission zero remains visible and the dip position does not change much .",
    "this is a crucial observation ",
    "the transmission zeros we find are roughly independent of the precise profile of the rashba strength .",
    "this robustness has an obvious importance for potential spintronic applications .",
    "we have performed a theoretical analysis of the transport properties of a ballistic quantum wire with spatially inhomogeneous rashba interaction in the presence of an external magnetic field giving rise to zeeman spin splitting . when the rashba coupling dominates the magnetic field an energy pseudogap develops in the wire spectrum .",
    "we find abrupt transmission lineshapes when the fermi energy lies within the pseudogap .",
    "the lineshapes are narrow and asymmetric and the transmission reaches zero for energies near the gap closing .",
    "we have discussed a minimal tight - binding model that reproduces the essential features of the resonances , yielding analytical expressions for the lineshape dependence on fermi energy , rashba intensity and zeeman splitting .",
    "qualitatively , the evanescent band plays the role of a quasi - bound state that the confined rashba interaction couples to the propagating states .",
    "the evanescent waves are not true bound states but when the fermi energy approaches the evanescent band bottom electrons scattering off the rashba region become strongly affected , leading to perfect reflection .",
    "numerical results in realistic quantum wires agree with the purely 1d case .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the behavior of the resonances when the angular orientation of the magnetic field is changed and the interfaces become smoother .",
    "the system studied here could work as a current modulator device . for slight variations of the fermi energy , which can be externally controlled",
    ", we have shown that the transmission changes dramatically between two limit values ( 1 and 0 ) across the antiresonance .",
    "our proposal has a number of differences compared to the datta - das spin transistor.@xcite first , the latter device modulates the current independently of the energy of the injected electrons since the phase difference @xmath221 that governs the spin precession is independent of the wavevector .",
    "then , small changes of @xmath1 or @xmath119 strongly affects the working points of the transistor whereas in our case these points are not very sensitive to small variations of the external parameters such as the external magnetic field , the rashba strength or the interface diffusivity .",
    "moreover , a 100@xmath222 current modulation is hard to achieve in the datta - das transistor , especially when intersubband coupling is taken into account , whereas in our case the modulation is rather abrupt and is preserved even when adjacent subbands are coupled , an effect which is unavoidable in real quantum wires .",
    "we have reported results for the lowest spin - split subband but have checked that similar pronounced dips are seen in higher subbands .",
    "our results differ also with those of ref .",
    "since in that case the antiresonances reached zero only after a fine tuning of the parameters . here , our only requirement is that the fermi energy should lie within the spectrum pseudogap .    as far as the discussion in 1d wires",
    "is concerned , the field directions orthogonal to the rashba field ( along @xmath4 , according to the parameterization of the hamiltonian we have employed ) are equivalent . however , in the quasi-1d case one of these directions ( the one perpendicular to both the rashba field and the electron propagation ) induce orbital effects . here ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to fields giving rise only to zeeman splittings since the study of orbital effects in inhomogeneous systems requires knowledge of the evanescent states when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the wire plane .",
    "this is not a trivial task and it seems to be promising avenue of future research .",
    "reference finds important changes in the spectrum structure of a quantum wire with uniform rashba interaction and perpendicular magnetic fields",
    ". however , our sharp antiresonances show up even in the presence of rather small zeeman splittings .",
    "therefore , we expect that the dips should be still visible even when orbital effects are taken into account provided the magnetic field length is much larger than the confinement length .    in our discussion ,",
    "we have neglected electron - electron interaction effects , which may lead to luttinger liquid effects in 1d ballistic wires when the interactions are screened like in a wire with electric - field induced spin - orbit interactions.@xcite when zeeman splittings are present @xcite the transmission seems to be altered by electron - electron interactions , although these works neglect the intersubband coupling term of the rashba interaction . in fact , for ballistic wires without rashba coupling but multiple populated subbands a simple mean - field approach demonstrates@xcite that coulomb interactions are crucial to understand rectification effects observed in nanojunction rectifiers . on the other hand ,",
    "single - particle effects are shown@xcite to lead to coulomb blockade antiresonances of the fano form .",
    "hence , further work is needed to clarify the influence of coulomb interactions in the conductance of a quantum wire with zeeman splitting and a localized rashba interaction .",
