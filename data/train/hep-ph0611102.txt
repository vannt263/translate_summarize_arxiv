    "<S> [ eq : lbl ]    the major uncertainty in the standard model prediction of the anomalous moment , @xmath19 , comes from the contribution of the @xmath29 channel . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the @xmath30 cross section data , available in 2003 , give the dominant contribution to ( [ eq : hadlo ] ) of about @xmath31 . since then the situation has improved considerably . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , new precise measurements have recently become available from the cmd-2 detector throughout the centre - of - mass energy range @xmath32 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the kloe collaboration have made measurements of the cross section by the radiative return method over the range @xmath33 gev @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we show , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , how the contribution @xmath50 varies as a function of the cluster size @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for this channel , we have fixed the cluster size in the small energy interval from 0.778 to 0.787 gev containing the @xmath51 interference effects , to be @xmath52 mev , thus improving the quality and stability of the fit considerably . ) </S>",
    "<S> the improvement due to the inclusion of the new @xmath49 data is immediately clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . choosing the cluster size @xmath47 to be 3.5 mev , as in our previous analysis @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the contribution @xmath50 is reduced by @xmath53 , and that the uncertainty in the value decreases from @xmath54 to @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the result is stable to the variation of the choice of the cluster size in the range from 3 to 10 mev . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the minimum @xmath56 of the clustering fit to the data , divided by the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath57 , is , to a good approximation , equal to @xmath58 for all choices of @xmath47 in this interval .     </S>",

    "<S> the light ( orange ) band indicates the error band of the fit without the recent cmd-2 ( 2006 ) and snd data which became available after our previous analysis @xcite , whereas the ( blue ) line and darker ( red ) band correspond to the mean value and error band of the new fit including all data as indicated in the two panels.,title=\"fig:\",height=415 ] +   data in the low and high energy @xmath59-resonance tail regions ( upper and lower panels ) , compared to our fits using a clustering size of @xmath60 mev . </S>",

    "<S> it comes about equally from the intervals @xmath62 gev and @xmath63 gev , with only a small reduction in @xmath19 coming from the intervening energy range . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , where the data are displayed together with two fits for a cluster size @xmath60 mev ( recall from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] the insensitivity of the integrated result to variation of @xmath47 in the range @xmath64 mev ) , which correspond to our previous and the present analyses . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the two bands shows that the introduction of the cmd-2 ( and snd ) data gives , on average , a smaller cross section in the energy regions above 410 and above 1030 mev in the upper and lower plots , respectively , of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the inclusion of the kloe @xmath49 data in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> note that kloe measures the hadronic cross section via the _ radiative return _ method in @xmath65 at the @xmath66 factory da@xmath66ne in frascati . here </S>",
    "<S> the observation of initial state photon radiation at various energies allows for a determination of the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath49 system . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is completely independent of the ` direct scan ' measurements of cmd-2 and snd at vepp-2 m in novosibirsk which use a tunable @xmath67 beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the kloe data @xcite have a different energy dependence to the other @xmath49 data sets , especially when compared with the recent cmd-2 and snd analyses , see e.g. the discussions in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our clustering prescription allows overlapping data sets to adjust by an overall constant within the systematic error of each set , but does not allow for an energy dependent renormalization . if we would include the kloe data in the fit , then they would be normalized upwards by nearly two percent .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ht ]     data in the @xmath59 central region ( blue line ) compared to the fit without the kloe data ( red band ) , together with data from cmd-2 , snd and kloe ( as indicated).,height=529 ]    this in turn would lead to a sizeable effect in the fit , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] : the ( blue ) line is the mean value of the fit including the kloe data , whereas the ( red ) band is the error band for the fit excluding kloe . in the dispersion integral this would lead to an artificial overall shift of @xmath68 upwards by about @xmath69 . as the @xmath70 , for the ` clustering ' fit to the @xmath49 data , would increase significantly from the value 1.1 found above , the improvement of the error on @xmath68 after inflation by @xmath71 would be very small . </S>",
    "<S> however the kloe data @xcite more than adequately populate the energy interval of their measurement , @xmath72 gev , so that we can compute reliably their integrated contribution to the dispersion relation of ( [ eq : disprel1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find a_^,lo(kloe  only , 0.6 - 0.97  )  =  ( 385.7 4.9 ) 10 ^ -10 . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared to that obtained in the complete analysis ( in which the kloe data were omitted ) a_^,lo(fit  w / o  kloe , 0.6 - 0.97  )  =  ( 384.3 2.5 ) 10 ^ -10 , where , as is to be expected , the error is less . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , despite their different energy dependence , the agreement of the kloe integrated contribution with that of the fit of all other data is excellent . therefore , for our sm prediction of @xmath73 , we combine both contributions for this energy interval . doing so we arrive at a_^,lo  =  ( 384.6 2.2 ) 10 ^ -10 , for the interval @xmath72 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the kloe data is to slightly increase the magnitude and reduce the error . as a result , the @xmath49 contribution in the interval @xmath74 gev , becomes @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the inclusion of the new @xmath49 data , we have made other improvements in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> one small improvement that we have made is to evaluate the vacuum polarisation corrections to the data using our recent determination @xcite of the running of the effective coupling @xmath76 in the time - like region @xmath77 , which was obtained using our clustered data set . </S>",
    "<S> this is more consistent than using the evaluation by jegerlehner @xcite that we did previously . </S>",
    "<S> this is a correction to a correction , and so hardly changes the result .    </S>",
    "<S> a more important improvement is that for the subleading exclusive channels we have included new data from cmd-2 @xcite ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) , babar @xcite ( @xmath81 , @xmath78 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) ; and from bes @xcite for the inclusive hadronic cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the new data are summarized in table  [ tab : gm2table ] . </S>",
    "<S> it lists the contributions to @xmath85 which have changed since our previous prediction . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the main change arises from the inclusion of the new @xmath49 data : @xmath86 in units of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this is partially compensated by changes in other contributions , such as @xmath87 ( due mainly to the new bes data ) and @xmath88 ( due to the new leptonic widths of @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> including all the hadronic contributions we obtain a_^had , lo   =   ( 689.4 4.2_exp 1.8_rad )    10 ^ -10  , [ eq : hadlonew ] and , similarly for nlo , a_^had , nlo   =   ( -9.79 0.08_exp 0.03_rad )    10 ^ -10  , [ eq : hadnlonew ] which are to be compared with ( [ eq : hadlo ] ) and ( [ eq : hadnlo ] ) respectively .    </S>",

    "<S> we see that there is now a 3.4@xmath5 discrepancy between experiment and the sm prediction . in the upper part of the plot </S>",
    "<S> we show four earlier determinations @xcite of @xmath19 that were made before the cmd-2 @xcite , kloe @xcite and snd @xcite @xmath2 data became available . </S>",
    "<S> the light - by - light contribution used in these determinations varies from @xmath91 in dehz(03 ) to the more recent estimate @xcite of @xmath92 used in hmnt(03b,06 ) , see ( [ eq : lbl]).,height=415 ]    finally , adding all the terms of ( [ eq : amusm ] ) and ( [ eq : had ] ) , we obtain the updated standard model prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon : @xmath93 that is , the difference @xmath94 is @xmath95 . </S>",
