    "a number of non - linear field theories possess solitonic - like solutions .",
    "these have broad applications in many branches of physics and constitute localized , globally regular structures with finite energy .",

    "non - topological solitons @xcite on the other hand appear in models with symmetries and possess a locally conserved noether current and a globally conserved noether charge .",
    "an example of such a non - topological soliton is the @xmath0-ball @xcite and its generalization in curved space - time , the boson star @xcite .",
    "these are solutions of models with self - interacting complex scalar fields and the conserved noether charge @xmath0 is then related to the global phase invariance of the theory and is directly proportional to the frequency of the harmonic time - dependence .",
    "@xmath0 can e.g. be interpreted as particle number @xcite . as such",
    ", these solutions have been constructed in @xmath5-dimensional models with non - renormalizable @xmath6-potential @xcite , but also in supersymmetric extensions to the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . in the latter case , several scalar fields interact via complicated potentials .",
    "it was shown that cubic interaction terms that result from yukawa couplings in the superpotential and supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms lead to the existence of @xmath0-balls with non - vanishing baryon or lepton number or electric charge .",
    "these supersymmetric @xmath0-balls have been considered as possible candidates for baryonic dark matter @xcite and their astrophysical implications have been discussed @xcite . in @xcite , these objects have been constructed numerically using the exact form of a scalar potential that results from gauge - mediated susy breaking . however , this potential is non - differentiable at the susy breaking scale . in @xcite a differentiable approximation of this potential",
    "was suggested and the properties of the corresponding @xmath0-balls have been investigated .",
    "most models of a quantum theory of gravity need more than @xmath5 dimensions and as such , it is surely of interest to investigate the properties of soliton solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "the first study of @xmath0-balls in higher dimensional space - time has been done in @xcite . in @xcite a mixture of analytical and numerical tools was used , while in @xcite only a linearized version of the lagrangian and equations of motion depending only in zeroth order on the ratio between the typical energy scale and the planck mass has been used . in this case ,",
    "an analytical solution can be given , however , the model does not capture the non - linear phenomena such as e.g. the behaviour of the mass and charge at the maximal frequency .",
    "a similar study has been done in @xcite for @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "@xmath0-balls and boson star solutions of the full system of coupled non - linear equations in @xmath7-dimensional asymptotically flat space - time have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the behaviour of the mass and charge at the approach of the maximal possible frequency is different for @xmath8 as compared to @xmath9 .",
    "this was related to a scaling behaviour of the solutions at this critical approach and different dimensions of the spatial integrals . spinning generalisations of these solutions",
    "can also be constructed @xcite .",
    "these solutions possess a quantised angular momentum that is an integer multiple of the noether charge .",
    "topological and non - topological solitons in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time have been investigated intensively recently .",
    "the interest in these objects is related to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite which states that a gravity theory in a @xmath4-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space  time is equivalent to a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the @xmath10-dimensional boundary of ads .",
    "interestingly , this is a weak - strong coupling duality that can be used to describe strongly coupled quantum field theories with the help of weakly coupled gravity theories .",
    "this has been applied to a modeling of high temperature superconductivity with the help of classical black hole and soliton solutions in ads @xcite .",
    "the basic models use a scalar field coupled to a @xmath2 gauge field and the observation that close to the horizon of the black hole the effective mass of the scalar field can become negative with masses below the breitenlohner ",
    "freedman bound @xcite such that the scalar field becomes unstable and possesses a non  vanishing value on and close to the horizon of the black hole . when computing the conductivities it turns out that the formation of a scalar field on a charged black hole corresponds to a phase transition from a conductor to a superconductor .",
    "however , insulator / superconductor phase transitions also play an important role in high temperature superconductivity and as such models including solitons have been suggested that describe this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the ads soliton is related to the black hole by a double wick rotation with one of the coordinates compactified to a circle and has originally been suggested to describe a confining vacuum in the dual gauge theory @xcite since it possesses a mass gap . for solutions with ricci - flat horizons",
    "there is a phase transition between the ads black hole and the ads soliton @xcite which was interpreted as a confining / deconfining phase transition in the dual gauge theory .",
    "note that this is different for black holes in global ads where the black hole decays to global ads space - time when lowering the temperature @xcite .    in the limit of vanishing gauge coupling",
    "the soliton solutions correspond to planar boson stars in ads space - time .",
    "since the scalar field is uncharged the interpretation in terms of insulators / superconductors is difficult in this case .",
    "however , since the ads / cft correspondence connects strongly coupled cfts to weakly coupled gravity theories the prototype example of a strongly coupled field theory comes to mind - quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "as such the planar boson stars in ads have been interpreted as bose - einstein condensates of glueballs .",
    "glueballs are color - neutral bound states of gluons predicted by qcd and the scalar glueball ( which is also the lightest possible glueball ) is predicted to have a mass of 1 - 2 gev ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview on experimental results ) .",
    "since these glueballs appear due to non - linear interactions and as such can not be described by a perturbative approach it is very difficult to make predictions within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "however , holographic methods have been applied to make predictions about glueball spectra ( see e.g. @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "non - spinning boson stars in @xmath1-dimensional ads space - time have been studied before using a massive scalar field without self - interaction @xcite and in @xmath5 dimensions with an exponential self - interaction potential @xcite . spinning solutions in @xmath3 and @xmath5 dimensions",

    ", a second branch of solutions exists that has lower mass and charge for a fixed value of @xmath46 .",
    "this second branch extends back to a critical value of @xmath46 and then forms another branch .",
    "this spiraling has been observed before in @xmath9 and is apparently also present in @xmath94 .",
    "we can also read off the dependence of @xmath145 and @xmath92 on @xmath4 and @xmath126 from fig.[mq_om1 ] .",
    "as is apparent , @xmath146 does neither depend on @xmath126 nor on @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of the minimal frequency @xmath145 depends strongly on @xmath126 and @xmath4 . for fixed @xmath4",
    "it increases with increasing @xmath126 , i.e. the stronger the interaction between the gravitational field and the scalar field the larger we have to choose the value of the frequency to find solutions .",
    "this is true for all @xmath4 that we have studied .",
    "we also notice that the decrease in @xmath46 is bigger in higher @xmath4 when increasing @xmath126 by the same amount . for fixed @xmath126",
    "our results indicate that @xmath145 increases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "normally , we would expect gravity in higher @xmath4 to become weaker since it can leak into extra dimensions , however , here we are keeping @xmath147 , i.e. the strength of the gravitational interaction constant .",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath0 for different values of @xmath126 and @xmath4 in fig.[m_over_q ] . as expected boson stars in asymptotically flat space - time are stable to decay into @xmath0 free bosons since these objects are gravitationally bound .",
    "this is also true for the case @xmath140 , where no bound on the mass @xmath64 and charge @xmath0 exist .",
    "as is clearly seen from fig.[m_over_q ] we find that also for @xmath128 the curve is always below @xmath148 .",
    "for @xmath67 it was found that for small values of @xmath46 there is a relation between @xmath64 and @xmath0 that depends on @xmath46 and @xmath4 @xcite . in fig.[m_over_omegaq ] we plot @xmath144 as function of @xmath46 and find that only for @xmath39 the approximation of flat space - time @xmath149 is a good approximation for small @xmath46 .",
    "for larger values of @xmath4 the solutions do not exist for small @xmath46 and @xmath144 is always smaller than one .",
    "we have also studied boson stars in ads space - time .",
    "our results for the mass @xmath64 and charge @xmath0 in dependence on the frequency @xmath46 are shown in fig.[mq_om_lam ] for @xmath110 .",
    "as for @xmath67 , we find that the mass tends to zero at @xmath93 , while at @xmath150 we find the spiraling behaviour typical for boson star solutions .",
    "this is true for all @xmath97 .",
    "hence , while boson stars in asymptotically flat space - time with @xmath140 dimensions can have arbitrarily large masses and charges , their mass and charge are bounded from above in asymptotically ads space - time .",
    "the value of @xmath92 depends on @xmath15 and @xmath4 , but not on @xmath126 .",
    "it increases with decreasing @xmath15 and decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "again , this can be explained with the fact that the maximal value of @xmath46 can be very well approximated by @xmath113 .    in terms of the holographic interpretation",
    "our solutions describe scalar glueball condensates including backreaction .",
    "our results for the expectation value of the dual operator on the ads boundary are given in fig.[glueballs_backreaction ] .",
    "we observe that the value of the condensate at a fixed value of the mass @xmath64 increases with increasing @xmath126 , i.e. backreaction of the space - time .",
    "this is true for all @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , there exists a maximal possible value of the condensate at the maximal value of the mass corresponding to intermediate values of @xmath125 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-balls and boson stars in ( asymptotically ) flat as well as ads space - time .",
    "we have used an exponential self - interaction potential for the scalar field motivated from mssms .",
    "we find that the behaviour of the solutions in asymptotically flat space - time at the approach of the maximal frequency depends strongly on the number of spatial dimensions @xmath4 such that for @xmath151 boson stars exist only up to a maximal value of the mass and charge , while for @xmath140 the mass and charge of these objects can become arbitrarily large .",
    "however , our numerical results also indicate that for @xmath128 a mass gap for the solutions exists . on the other hand , the value of the maximal and minimal frequency does not depend on @xmath4 in this case .",
    "we show that the existence of boson stars in @xmath3-dimensional asymptotically flat space - time depends crucially on the choice of the scalar potential . for our choice of potential , @xmath3-dimensional boson stars always exist .",
    "we also generalize the exact @xmath0-ball solution in ads space - time found in @xcite to @xmath4 dimensions and find that the conclusion about the maximal value of @xmath46 drawn from this solution gives a good approximation to our numerical results .",
    "as such the maximal value of the frequency @xmath46 decreases with decreasing ads radius and with @xmath4 .",
    "we can also draw conclusions about the stability of these objects with respect to the decay into @xmath0 free bosons .",
    "while there are stable as well as unstable @xmath0-balls in minkowski space - time for @xmath97 , they are always stable in @xmath39 . in ads space - time @xmath0-balls are stable for small values of the charge and unstable for large values of the charge .",
    "boson stars in asymptotically flat space - time are always stable , while for asymptotically ads we find that only for @xmath39 and above a critical @xmath46 the solutions become stable . for all other @xmath4",
    "the solutions are stable .    with view to the holographic interpretation spinning solutions in asymptotically ads space - time play an important role .",
    "these solutions has been constructed recently in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the ansatz was chosen such that the boundary theory possesses no rotation and hence describes static glueball condensates .",
    "it is surely of interest to generalize this to find a holographic description of scalar glueballs possessing angular momentum .",
