    "superradiance @xcite and associated collective phenomena @xcite have raised continuous interests in the past sixty years .",
    "these collective effects are due to the induced dipole - dipole interaction @xcite that comes from the common field mediating the atomic system .",
    "this resonant dipole - dipole interaction is in essence long - ranged , therefore the decay behavior heavily depends on the interatomic distance and the geometry of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the spontaneous decay can exhibit superradiance that is more commonly observed in experiments , and also cooperative lamb shift ( cls ) @xcite and subradiance , that are less observable because of the demanding precision and signal - to - noise ratio in measurements .",
    "recent studies involve a fast decay of second - order correlation of two photons from the cascade atomic ensemble @xcite , and a redshift of cls in the embedded fe atoms in the planar cavity @xcite , the atomic vapor layer @xcite , an ionic atomic system @xcite , and a cold - atom ensemble @xcite .",
    "subradiant decay can also be measured in diversified atomic systems of ring / disk plasmonic nanocavities @xcite , ultracold molecules @xcite , and a large cloud of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent proposals of singly - excited states that can describe single - photon superradiance @xcite and subradiance @xcite provide a new direction in investigating these collective effects in a limited but complete hilbert space .",
    "the advantage of the setting of single - photon interacting with the atoms restricts this space to @xmath0 singly - excited states and one ground state , hugely simplifying the dynamical light - matter interacting systems of for example @xmath1 states of @xmath0 two - level atoms .    in this paper",
    "we propose a complete hilbert space of cooperative single - photon states that are responsible for the superradiance and subradiance .  in section 2 , we introduce these states that can be prepared in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) atomic array with one atom per site .  in section 3",
    ", we introduce the theoretical background of our analysis .",
    "we then investigate the time evolutions of the subradiant states in section 4 , which can be observable in fluorescence experiments , and we discuss and conclude in section 5 .",
    "when a single photon interacts with two - level atoms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the ground and excited states respectively , the so - called timed dicke state is formed on absorbing this photon @xcite , @xmath4 is the wavevector of single photon .",
    "the above denotes a superposition of one and only one excited state with the rest of ( @xmath5 ) ground state atoms .",
    "this timed dicke state is symmetrical under exchange of any two atoms , thus shows superradiant decay after the absorption .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is responsible for the emergence of enhanced decay behavior .",
    "however since this symmetrical state is not the eigenstate for this long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction in general , it couples with other nonsymmetrical ( ns ) and orthogonal states during the process of spontaneous emission .",
    "these ns states on the other hand are responsible for both super- and subradiant decays , and can be observed in the emission long after the superradiant decay @xcite .  the possible candidates for these ns states can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .  following the proposal of ns states in one - dimensional atomic array @xcite ,",
    "we further extend it to a 3d case which is more advantageous in the efficiency of absorbing the photon and has richer physics in super- and sub - radiance due to its dimensionality .    in @xcite",
    ", we utilize the de moivre s formula to construct the complete hilbert space of singly - excited states and the extension to a 3d atomic array is straightforward , @xmath6 the de moivre s formula is intentionally used for finding the nth root of unity , where there exists a complex number @xmath7 such that @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 .  for the construction of @xmath0 singly - excited states",
    ", we then take the roots of @xmath11 @xmath9 @xmath10 as state coefficients which are @xmath12 for @xmath13 @xmath14",
    "[ @xmath10 , @xmath0 ] in the above .",
    "the extra phases ( other than the light propagating phase @xmath16 ) of the above singly - excited states can be imprinted by a zeeman or stark field gradient which is commonly used in controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) @xcite in quantum memory of light @xcite .  the labeling of the imprinted phases associated with the atomic indices @xmath17 s however is not arbitrary .  for the discrete and linearly increasing phases we manipulate to imprint on the atomic array , these @xmath17 s need to be labeled also linearly in specific orders along the axes .",
    "the order of the axes matters only on the relative gradient strength applied , and without loss of generality we choose the labeling order first along @xmath18 , then @xmath19 and @xmath20 as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "is created with a single photon absorption ( abs . ) , which evolves to other super- or sub - radiant dm states @xmath21 via a unitary transformation @xmath22 to imprint the required phases .",
    "later single - photon fluorescence ( fl . )",
    "measurements confirm the dm state preparation .",
    "( b ) the required spatially - varying phases can be imprinted via electrodes along three axes ( we omit the electrodes along @xmath19 for clear demonstration ) , and the labeling of atomic indices is shown on the side of the array as an example of the ordering.,width=377,height=264 ]    for schematic demonstration , in figure [ fig1 ] we show the proposed setting of investigating super- and sub - radiance in a 3d atomic array .",
    "the preparation of the dm states @xmath21 can be done by first preparing the symmetrical state @xmath23 on absorbing a single photon",
    ".  then we evolve @xmath23 to @xmath21 via a unitary transformation to imprint the required linearly increasing phases .",
    "the phases can be accumulated either by a zeeman field gradient @xcite , an ac stark field utilizing beam shaping @xcite , or electrodes used in praseodymium dopants in yttrium orthosilicate ( pr@xmath24:y@xmath25sio@xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the unitary transformation is @xmath22 @xmath27 @xmath28 , where the interaction energy @xmath29 could be @xmath30 from the magnetic field gradient @xmath31 @xmath9 @xmath32 or @xmath33 from stark field gradient @xmath34 @xmath9 @xmath35 , along the @xmath20 axis for example .",
    "the interaction time is @xmath36 which determines the amount of the phases for specific dm state .",
    "we note that the amplitudes of the coefficients are equal in our proposed dm states which are thus endowed with a cooperative nature .  in the next section",
    "we introduce the theoretical background for the analysis of the property and the time evolutions of these dm states we manage to prepare .",
    "the dynamical time evolution of a single photon interacting with @xmath0 two - level atoms can be described by the hamiltonian ( @xmath37 ) in an interaction picture ( @xmath38 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) @xcite , @xmath39 \\label{v},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the dipole operator is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath27 @xmath42 and the transition frequency is @xmath43 @xmath9 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 .",

    "the above is a typical treatment for a quantized bosonic field ( @xmath50 ) interacting with the atoms using the dipole approximation @xcite , while the counter rotating - wave terms are kept in order to correctly account for the frequency shift of the dipole - dipole interaction which we show below .    solving heisenberg equations of motion from the above hamiltonian with secular approximations @xcite",

    "single particle ( intrinsic ) decay constant is @xmath61 as a frequency scale .",
    "the above is the origin of resonant dipole - dipole interaction induced by the common light - matter interaction and rescattering events in the interacting medium .",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are essentially long - ranged , and respectively they are cooperative decay rates and cooperative lamb shifts .    to investigate the time evolution of dm states in a 3d atomic array , we use the schrdinger equations projected from the above lindblad form .",
    "first we define @xmath64 @xmath27 @xmath65 as the bare state bases , and their time evolutions can be derived by using @xmath51 @xmath9 @xmath66 projecting on @xmath67 .",
    "then the state of the atomic system in schrdinger picture can be expressed as @xmath68 @xmath9 @xmath69 , where the probability amplitudes @xmath70 satisfy @xmath71 and @xmath72 we further solve the above coupled equations by a similarity transformation , and diagonalize @xmath73 with the eigenvalues @xmath74 and eigenvectors @xmath75 , such that @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the initial condition of the system .",
    "we assume that the atoms are initially in one of the dm states @xmath78 , the state vector @xmath68 is then time - evolved as @xmath79 where the initial condition asserts that @xmath80 @xmath9 @xmath81 .  using the relation of the coefficient transformation , @xmath82",
    "finally we derive the time evolution of the dm states @xcite , @xmath83 where @xmath84 the @xmath85 is the inner product of @xmath13th dm state and @xmath86th eigenstate in @xmath75 , and @xmath87 indicates how close dm states are to the eigen ones .",
    "we further use a normalized weighting of @xmath88 as a measure of the portion for specific @xmath89 that governs the time evolution of the dm states .  below",
    "we proceed to investigate the subradiance in optically thin ( cubic ) and thick ( rectangular ) atomic arrays , and locate the subradiant dm state that has longest lifetime for various lattice spacings and atom numbers .",
    "before we investigate the decay property of subradiant dm states , it is instructive to study the coupling strength of the induced dipole - dipole interaction in dm state bases .",
    "this will guide us to locate the lowest eigenvalues from the dependence of lattice spacings .",
    "we use a 3d atomic array of @xmath90 @xmath9 @xmath91 as an example , where @xmath0 @xmath9 @xmath92 .",
    "we use a linear polarization of light ( @xmath49 @xmath9 @xmath18 ) propagating along the long axis @xmath20 , and the coupling strength is defined as @xmath93.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in figure [ fig2 ] , we show the coupling strengths for various dm states in a 3d atomic array of dimensions @xmath94",

    "it has no periodic dependence of lattice spacings as in one - dimensional ( 1d ) finite @xcite or infinite atomic chain @xcite with a period of @xmath101 or @xmath102 respectively .",
    "the reason is that the linearly increasing phases are imprinted on three perpendicular axes in our 3d case , such that equidistant shifted @xmath13th dm states do not follow the period of the sinusoidal functions in the dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "a new observation is relatively small coupling strength at the circled plateau where @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 for @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath99 dm state .",
    "this puts the 3d dm states in advantage over 1d case to prepare a subradiant state since experimentally it is more feasible and less challenging to prepare and control the optical lattices at a spacing of @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 .     of the dm states for various lattice spacings with @xmath90 @xmath9 @xmath91 .",
    "small coupling strengths appear at small lattice spacing @xmath103 @xmath106 @xmath107 , and at plateau around @xmath103 @xmath9 @xmath108 ( dash - circle ) for the specific @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath99 dm state .  for larger lattice spacings ,",
    "coupling strengths approach an order of @xmath61 indicating a regime of independent atoms .",
    ", width=453,height=207 ]    from figure [ fig2 ] , we later study specifically @xmath103 @xmath9 @xmath109 and @xmath108 which correspond to the lowest coupling strengths for the dm states of @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath110 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "these subradiant dm states will be demonstrated later to show the smallest decay rates ( longest lifetimes ) that could be potentially useful in quantum storage of light .  since in general the dipole - dipole interaction",
    "is long - ranged and has no exact analytical solutions of the eigenstates , the dm states we propose to prepare in the 3d atomic array would couple to several eigenstates that can be numerically derived .",

    "the normalized weightings of @xmath13th dm states on the numerically derived eigenstates ( @xmath111 ) indicate how significant the eigenvalues @xmath89 s dominate the decay process and also suggestively how close the dm states projected on the eigen ones .  in our setting of rectangular array",
    "where @xmath97 @xmath112 @xmath113 in figure [ fig3 ] , we observe localized small groups of subspaces for the dm states .  in figure [ fig3](a ) , for example the pairs of @xmath13",

    "we consider in figure [ fig4](b ) , the lifetime of @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath99 dm state reaches an order of @xmath137 microseconds , a thousand - fold increase of the lifetime for free space decay of rubidium atoms ( @xmath137 ns ) .  with even more atoms , for example of @xmath138 atoms in an array of @xmath90 @xmath9 @xmath139 at a lattice spacing @xmath103 @xmath9 @xmath129 , @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath140 dm state reaches an even longer lifetime of @xmath141 milliseconds .    the beating frequency can also be observable in the fluorescence experiments as shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the major weightings of @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath110 on the pair of the eigenstates @xmath86 @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath98 for @xmath90 @xmath9 @xmath91 show one beating frequency of @xmath142 .",
    "similarly for @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath10 in an array of @xmath127 , the major weightings of this dm state are on the eigenstates @xmath86 @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath98 , giving an oscillatory but faster decay with a beating frequency of @xmath143 .",
    "this way we can determine the relative cls from the fluorescence measurements of the dm states .  more complicated beating structure is shown for a cubic array of @xmath128 for @xmath13 @xmath9 @xmath99 dm state which has up to three beating frequencies due to the spread out weightings on four major eigenmodes as can be seen in figure [ fig4](b ) .",
    "an issue of the dm states preparation protocol in figure [ fig1](a ) is the low efficiency of the initial superradiant state @xmath23 .",
    "this superradiant state decays faster than single atomic decay ( @xmath144 several nanoseconds for alkali metals ) , giving us an efficiency of @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the enhanced decay rate of the superradiant state we start with .  to restore the efficiency we can use ultrashort light pulse to control and imprint the phases @xcite from linear stark shift in a faster rate , thus with a higher efficiency .",
    "aside from the efficiency , the preparation of the dm states relies on the proper interaction time @xmath36 of the magnetic or electric field gradient which controls the imprinted phases .",
    "the inaccuracy of @xmath36 contributes to phase errors that influence the fidelity of the dm states we manage to prepare , which is twofold .",
    "one is the change of total weighting on the major subspace of the eigenstates and the other is the component of the weighting in this subspace .",
    "we note that the first change indicates a coupling outside the original subspace of the eigenstates , while both contribute to infidelity of the state preparation .",
    "experimentally a few percent of phase error should be tolerable , and the fidelity of the proposed dm states do not deviate much from the perfect case @xcite",
    ".  therefore our preparation protocol of dm states should be resilient to the fluctuations of interaction time .    in conclusion",
    ", we propose a complete hilbert space of cooperative single - photon states in a three - dimensional atomic array .",
    "these states can be realized in the two - level atoms confined in a three - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "our proposal can provide a setting to investigate the subradiance by a proper phase imprint on the atoms .",
    "cooperative lamb shift can be also observable from fluorescence measurements in either rectangular or cubic arrays .  for rectangular array , more localized and confined subspaces appear , indicating a close overlap of the dm states with the eigenstates .",
    "the lifetime of the manipulated dm states can be raised to an order of several milliseconds up to a hundred atoms , thus serving a robust quantum memory application .",
    "our setting is also alternative to study the cooperative behavior in the square and kagome lattices @xcite and the many - body long - range interactions in the alkaline - earth - metal atoms @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 @xmath109 or @xmath108 in a rectangular array of figure [ fig3 ] or a cubic one of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "atomic array with more atoms results in more reduction in the decay rate while the oscillatory structures result from the beating frequencies from two or more cooperative lamb shifts of the eigenstates .",

    "<S> we propose a complete superradiant and subradiant states that can be manipulated and prepared in a three - dimensional atomic array .  </S>",
    "<S> these subradiant states can be realized by absorbing a single photon and imprinting the spatially - dependent phases on the atomic system .  </S>",
    "<S> we find that the collective decay rates and associated cooperative lamb shifts are highly dependent on the phases we manage to imprint , and the subradiant state of long lifetime can be found for various lattice spacings and atom numbers .  </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate both optically thin and thick atomic arrays , which can serve for systematic studies of super- and sub - radiance .  </S>",
    "<S> our proposal offers an alternative scheme for quantum memory of light in a three - dimensional array of two - level atoms , which is applicable and potentially advantageous in quantum information processing .    </S>",
