    "the subject of quarkonium production has gained renewed interest due to the fact that it can now be understood from first principles .",
    "the production rates are calculated in a systematic expansion in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the relative velocity of the heavy quarks in the rest frame of the quarkonium bound state .",
    "this is accomplished by working in non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) where the expansion in @xmath10 is implemented by utilizing the scaling properties of non - perturbative matrix elements@xcite .",
    "the use of this effective theory has clarified formal issues and allowed for better fits to data . in general",
    ", nrqcd leads to larger cross sections than its historical predecessor , the color singlet model , largely because nrqcd predicts substantial contributions to various cross sections from the color octet channel .",
    "this happens even though the octet matrix elements are suppressed by powers of @xmath10 , because the color singlet channels can themselves be suppressed either kinematically or by powers of @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , @xmath11 production at the tevatron can now be well fit if one allows for color octet production@xcite .",
    "the field of quarkonium production itself has matured to the point where we would like to go beyond order of magnitude accuracy .",
    "indeed , once the formalism is verified quantitatively , it can be used as a tool in other areas in strong interaction physics , such as heavy ion collisions and the measurement of the spin dependent gluon distribution functions .",
    "presently , the values for the octet matrix element @xmath12 and a certain linear combination of the @xmath13 , and @xmath14 matrix elements have been extracted at the tevatron .",
    "these matrix elements should be universal in nature , in that we should be able to use them as input in other processes to make definite predictions .",
    "unfortunately , hadronic uncertainties in the tevatron extraction make this difficult .",
    "the extraction depends sensitively on the choice of gluon distribution function and factorization scale , as well as how one treats initial gluon radiation@xcite .",
    "extractions of @xmath15 are as disparate as @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , and @xmath19 @xcite , in@xmath20 . a process involving smaller theoretical uncertainties",
    "is needed .",
    "perhaps the cleanest setting to extract a value of the octet matrix element is in prompt @xmath0 production at lep , because in lepton initiated processes the theoretical errors are bounded by our computational strength rather than higher twist effects .",
    "furthermore , at lep we can measure the energy distribution as well , thus once we ve extracted the value of the octet matrix element , we can then make predictions for the moments of the rate .",
    "this provides a strong test for the color octet mechanism .",
    "formally there are two leading order contributions in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 expansion , both in the singlet channel , which are of order @xmath21 .",
    "there is a contribution from gluon radiation in the singlet channel @xmath22 that is suppressed by powers of @xmath23@xcite .",
    "there is also the color singlet charm quark fragmentation process @xmath24@xcite , which has no power suppression and thus dominates over non - fragmentation processes , for large @xmath25 .",
    "light quark octet fragmentation ( in which the mother parton does not combine to form part of the bound state ) is naively of order @xmath26 , down by @xmath27 compared to charm fragmentation .",
    "however , as it turns out , this channel is enhanced due to the presence of large logs as well as a numerical factor of five due to the number of possible quarks that initiate the process .",
    "indeed , previous calculations of the @xmath0 production rate at lep are dominated by these light quark fragmentation contributions @xcite .",
    "they give cross sections that are of the correct order of magnitude when values of the non - perturbative matrix elements are taken from the tevatron fits @xcite .",
    "however , the same logs that enhance the octet channel also put the convergence of the perturbative expansion into question .",
    "the tree - level calculation of the differential cross section in the color octet production channel@xcite is enhanced by a large logarithm , @xmath28 , leading to large double logs in the total rate . since @xmath29",
    ", we should treat @xmath30 as order one and resum all powers of the large logarithm . with this counting ,",
    "the octet channel is @xmath31 , on par with the singlet fragmentation contribution .",
    "more practically , the tree - level calculation has a factor of two uncertainty associated with the scale at which @xmath9 is evaluated , since @xmath32 ( this is just a restatement that there is a large logarithm ) .",
    "the resummation of the leading logarithms eliminates this uncertainty , so the resummation procedure is essential from both a practical and a formal standpoint .",
    "we therefore calculate the quarkonium differential production rate at lep taking all terms of the form @xmath33 as leading order .",
    "we will see that this resummation dramatically changes the differential cross section .",
    "however , summing the above mentioned logs will only yield the correct leading order differential rate if @xmath7 is sufficiently large .",
    "when @xmath7 is parametrically small , terms of the form @xmath34 become just as important .",
    "furthermore , these logs will also contribute double logs to the total rate given that the lower limit on @xmath7 is @xmath35 .",
    "this second type of log , due to soft gluon emission , is resummed using a formalism familiar from discussions of jet multiplicities@xcite .",
    "thus , we split the calculation into two regimes , @xmath36 and @xmath4 .",
    "we then interpolate between these regimes using the data .",
    "the tree - level differential rate for color octet @xmath0 production is @xcite @xmath37    \\log\\left(\\frac{z+z_l}{z - z_l}\\right ) - 2 z_l\\right\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the rescaled @xmath38 energy in the @xmath39 rest frame @xmath40 has a physical range of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and to the order we work , @xmath43 is twice the charm mass .",
    "performing the integration over @xmath7 leads to the aforementioned double logs . in the fragmentation limit ,",

    "the asterisk denotes convolution with the partonic production rates , @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 dependence of the fragmentation functions is canceled by that of the coefficient functions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "all dependence on @xmath43 is contained in the fragmentation functions , while all dependence on @xmath52 is contained in the coefficient functions .",
    "it is this factorized form that will later allow us to resum the large logarithms .",
    "we choose to define the color octet fragmentation functions according to collins and soper@xcite , @xmath53\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath54 is a gluon field strength tensor with color index @xmath55 and lorentz indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 is a quark field , @xmath59 is a creation operator for a @xmath38 meson , and @xmath60 is the number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "the fragmentation functions are interpreted as the probabilities for a parton with momentum @xmath61 to decay into a @xmath38 with light cone momentum @xmath62 .",
    "we have chosen to work in the light cone gauge , where eikonal factors usually written to make gauge invariance manifest reduce to the identity .",
    "an advantage of this definition over the alternative @xcite is its consistency with factorization at any subtraction scale @xmath49 .    for the case of quarkonium fragmentation @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "can be calculated in a systematic expansion in @xmath9 and @xmath10 by matching onto nrqcd .",
    "any soft divergences which may arise due to the semi - inclusive nature of the process cancel in the matching .",
    "since we are working to leading order no such divergences occur , and the matching is trivial in the sense that there are no corrections to be calculated in the effective theory .",
    "the calculation of these fragmentation functions are well documented in the literature@xcite , so here we just present our results which are in agreement with these previous calculations .    in the @xmath65 scheme we find    [ octetfrags ] @xmath66 - z\\right\\},\\\\ d_{g\\to\\psi}(\\mu^2,z ) & = & \\frac{\\pi\\alpha_s}{3m_\\psi^3 } \\,\\langle o_8^\\psi(^3s_1)\\rangle\\ , \\delta(1-z),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 @xmath68 is a color generator , while @xmath69 and @xmath38 are two component nrqcd spinors .",

    "( [ fragrate ] ) , we obtain the coefficient functions @xmath50 and @xmath51    [ wilsoncoeff ] @xmath70 -z\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that there is no physical distinction between what we call gluon fragmentation and what we call quark fragmentation , as it is always possible to shift some finite piece from one to the other .",
    "however , factorization dictates that we match in such a way as to make the wilson coefficients independent of the long distance physics , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "once we choose the scale @xmath49 to be @xmath71 , there are no large logs in the wilson coefficients .",
    "they have been shuffled into the fragmentation functions and can be resummed via the dglap @xcite equations .",
    "all the leading logs , of order @xmath72 $ ] , will reside in the quark fragmentation function .",
    "the contribution from gluon fragmentation is then subleading , contributing only at @xmath73 to the rate .",
    "we choose to keep this contribution in order to reduce the @xmath49 dependence of our result , although we do not claim accuracy to the level @xmath74 .",
    "there are other terms of this order , arising from both two - loop running and the @xmath74 corrections to the initial gluon fragmentation function , that have not been included .",
    "in addition to the color octet contribution we include the contribution from the color singlet , which is formally @xmath21 , but as mentioned above is numerically smaller than the octet contribution . again using the collins - soper definition for the singlet fragmentation function we find    @xmath75    which agrees with @xcite .",
    "the resummation of the @xmath77 is accomplished via the usual renormalization group analysis of the fragmentation functions .",
    "the evolution equations are given by    [ evolution ] @xmath78    where the functions @xmath79 are the standard splitting functions .",
    "we solved these equations numerically using @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and chose @xmath83 to be consistent with one - loop running from @xmath52 .",
    "= 11truecm    the contributions to the differential rate from both the evolved octet ( solid line ) and evolved singlet ( dotted line ) fragmentation functions are displayed in fig .  1 , in units of mev .",
    "we used the tevatron extraction @xcite to obtain the normalization of the octet fragmentation functions . for comparison ,",
    "the octet contribution without evolution is shown in dashed lines , and the singlet contribution without evolution in dot - dashed lines .",
    "resummation of the @xmath84 terms greatly enhances both the octet and singlet rates at small @xmath7 .",
    "however , as mentioned above we should not trust this result in the small @xmath7 regime .    at this point",
    "we should point out that there are some values of @xmath85 where the differential rate is not trustworthy . when @xmath7 approaches within @xmath86 of one , we begin to probe the hadronic structure of the quarkonium state , and the expansion in @xmath10 breaks down@xcite . to correctly describe quarkonium production at the edge of phase space",
    "we must introduce a structure function @xcite which resums all the large non - perturbative corrections .",
    "indeed , lep would be an ideal place to study these structure functions if there were more data available . in the total cross section",
    "however , or any sufficiently smeared version of the differential rate , such as the first ten or so moments , the expansion in @xmath10 is well behaved .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath7 is @xmath88 , so that when @xmath89 , we need to include a resummation of the @xmath6 terms . indeed , the generic term in the decay rate has pieces of the form @xmath90 .",
    "we thus treat @xmath91 to be of the same order as @xmath84 , and resum all terms of the above form .",
    "this problem was first encountered in the calculation of jet multiplicities , where it was noticed that the splitting functions are highly singular at small @xmath7 and need to be resummed .",
    "the results of these calculations led to predictions for the shape of the hadron multiplicties ( under some assumptions of quark - hadron duality ) which fit the data extremely well@xcite .",
    "indeed , the results make the striking prediction that there should be a suppression at small @xmath7 which sets in at higher @xmath7 than would be expected from just phase space suppression .",
    "this suppression is due to angular ordering of soft gluon emission and is a consequence of gluon coherence which is naively missed in canonical ladder resummations@xcite .",
    "our calculation differs from those previous calculations of hadron multiplicities in that we can actually calculate the hadronic fragmentation function in a systematic fashion , in terms of some ( in our case effectively one ) unknown matrix element .",
    "thus , we are concerned with the normalization as well as the shape of the differential decay rate .",
    "there are several different formalisms for handling the coherent gluon emission problem@xcite .",
    "we choose to follow the formalism developed by mueller @xcite , and we refer the reader to these papers for details .",
    "we begin by noticing that it is the gluon splitting function which is most singular at small z , @xmath92 .",
    "thus , at leading order as defined above , the branching will all come from gluon splitting once the initial quarks mix into a gluon . for",
    "the moment let us consider pure gluon splitting .",
    "all the leading logs come from ladder diagrams of the form shown in fig .  2 ( without the initial quark box ) .",
    "the coherence issues can be skirted by imposing angular ordering on the gluons such that the angle between two branching partons is smaller than the angle of the previous pair@xcite .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the series via the integral equation @xmath93 where @xmath94 and at the end of the calculation @xmath95 is taken to be @xmath96 in order to enforce the angular ordering . for now",
    ", @xmath97 has been normalized to 1 .",
    "iterating this equation leads to @xmath98 taking moments of eq .",
    "( [ iterate ] ) gives @xmath99 the above sums have a simple closed form .",
    "after reinserting the normalization @xmath100 where @xmath101,\\\\ c_n & = & 1 - \\frac{2 \\gamma_n}{\\sqrt{(n-1)^2 + 8\\alpha_sc_a/\\pi}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath102 is the resummed diagonal anomalous dimension of the fragmentation function . if we expand in @xmath9 , then it correctly reproduces the most singular pieces of the previously calculated two - loop splitting function@xcite .    at small @xmath7 ,",
    "the leading contribution to the quark fragmentation function comes from the gluon fragmentation function above , convoluted with @xmath103 .",
    "summing up all ladder diagrams of the form shown in fig .",
    "2 leads to @xmath104 with moments @xmath105 note that expanding eq .",
    "( [ smallxquark ] ) to leading order and convoluting with twice the coefficient function , eq .",
    "( [ wilsoncoeffa ] ) ( for quark and antiquark fragmentation ) , recovers the tree - level differential rate , eq .",
    "( [ fragrate ] ) , in the small @xmath7 limit .",
    "we can now use the renormalization group to improve eq .",
    "( [ dqmoments ] ) . after running we are left with , @xmath106 this equation can now be inverted back to @xmath7 space leading to the result @xmath107,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the coefficient of the one - loop beta function .",
    "this result was reached in the saddle point approximation where @xmath110 is small and thus should not be trusted for @xmath7 values larger than @xmath111 .",
    "subleading corrections to this result can be systematically included by properly adapting the formalism discussed in @xcite , where they were found to be of order @xmath112 at the peak .",
    "we should note that we expect the relative size of the subleading corrections to the total rate to be smaller than those for the differential rate , given that in the differential rate the subleading terms are down by @xmath91 , whereas in the total rate they are down by @xmath113 .",
    "we now have leading log expressions for the total and differential rates in the small and large @xmath7 regions . before we interpolate between the two we need to determine their respective regions of validity",
    "let us investigate the size of the contributions we are neglecting in the large @xmath7 region .",
    "the generic term in the decay rate has the form @xmath114 , where @xmath115 .",
    "the first term that is not included in the large @xmath7 resummation is suppressed by @xmath116 .",
    "thus a conservative value for the lower value of @xmath7 is @xmath117 .",
    "the small @xmath7 resummation is not valid at large @xmath7 for two reasons .",
    "first , we have used the saddle point approximation to compute the inverse mellon transform , which is only valid for @xmath118 small .",
    "second , we have neglected less singular terms in computing the small @xmath7 fragmentation result . therefore , we will trust the small @xmath7 result only up to the peak , where @xmath119 , but not for larger @xmath7 .",
    "we believe this to be a conservative upper bound on @xmath7 for this approximation .    thus , to obtain the full differential cross section , we interpolate between the small @xmath120 and large @xmath121 resummations using the data in this region as our guide .",
    "we checked that varying the interpolation while still staying within the error bars , changes the result by at most @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , we tested the sensitivity of our predictions to increasing and decreasing the lower bound on @xmath7 in the large @xmath7 regions as well as increasing the upper bound on the small @xmath7 region .",
    "these variations do not appreciably change the total rate or the first moment . note that _ decreasing _ upper bound on small @xmath7 regions does drastically change the results . however , taking the maximum value of @xmath7 to be below @xmath123 is not a reasonable thing to do however , given that the peak is the position where the saddle point approximation is trustworthy .",
    "in addition , the data for hadron multiplicites fits the resummed predictions extremely well near the peak@xcite .    in our final result",
    "we also included the non - fragmentation corrections given by the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ exact ] ) and ( [ fragform ] ) .",
    "these are significant at very small @xmath7 , and contribute to the total rate even when @xmath124 .",
    "since the data includes feed - down from excited charmonium states , the rate should be written in terms of the effective matrix elements @xcite @xmath125 saturating the excited states with the @xmath11 and @xmath126 , and using values for @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 from @xcite gives @xmath130 this number has at least a factor of two theoretical uncertainty .",
    "extracting the analogous color singlet matrix elements from the @xmath38 and @xmath11 electronic widths @xcite gives @xmath131 .",
    "combining the singlet and octet fragmentation contributions gives the total differential rate .",
    "integrating over @xmath38 energies yields a total branching ratio of @xmath132 compared to a branching ratio of @xmath133 from @xcite .",
    "the total branching ratio has been measured to be @xcite @xmath134 for opal and aleph , the uncertainties from left to right are statistical , systematic , and model - dependent , while for l3 and delphi , they are purely statistical .",
    "we use the lep average to extract a value for the effective octet matrix element of @xmath135 where the first uncertainty is purely statistical , and the second is theoretical .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty comes from adding in quadrature roughly @xmath136 contributions from perturbative corrections suppressed by @xmath83 , higher order matrix elements suppressed by @xmath86 , and subleading logs .",
    "since the lep experiments include feed - down from @xmath11 and @xmath137 , we can not directly compare our extraction of @xmath138 with those of @xmath139 in @xcite , but our value of @xmath140 is comparable with the central value from @xcite . while our statistical uncertainties are larger , our theoretical uncertainties are under good control .",
    "since this can not be said of tevatron extractions , where theoretical uncertainties dominate , we believe eq .",
    "( [ oeight ] ) represents the most reliable extraction currently available .",
    "3 shows the complete differential rate using our extracted value for @xmath140 .",
    "the solid line is the sum of the resummed singlet fragmentation and the interpolation between the large and small @xmath7 regions for octet fragmentation .",
    "the dashed line is the tree - level result and the data is from the aleph collaboration @xcite with efficiency correction from @xcite . given the large errors , it is difficult to make any definite statements , but it seems the resummed rate fits the data better at this time .",
    "the effect of evolution is to enhance the small-@xmath7 peak , a promising experimental signature of the octet component .",
    "a manifestation of this signature is a relatively small first moment , which we find to be @xmath141 while the tree - level differential rate , eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) , gives @xmath142 .",
    "a very rough estimate of this quantity obtained from the data @xcite suggests a value of @xmath143 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the color singlet prediction .",
    "the tree - level color singlet decay rate predicts the ratio of the first moment over the zeroth moment to be @xmath144 .",
    "resummation softens the color singlet decay rate , but the ratio is still too large , @xmath145 . the ratio is independent of the color singlet matrix element .",
    "therefore , even if the color singlet rate were arbitrarily increased so that the color singlet model fit the experimental branching ratio , the ratio of moments would not fit the data .",
    "a rigorous extraction of the first moment by the experimental groups could provide an extremely clean , quantitative test of the nrqcd approach .    in conclusion",
    ", we have resummed large logarithms in the rate for prompt @xmath0 production at lep to obtain the leading - order prediction .",
    "we predict a branching ratio that is slightly smaller than the tree - level prediction@xcite .",
    "moreover , we have eliminated a factor of 2 uncertainty in the tree - level result .",
    "matching our branching ratio to lep data yields an octet matrix element with substantially smaller theoretical uncertainties than from hadronic processes@xcite .",
    "the differential decay rate is dramatically softer than previous calculations .",
    "the small-@xmath7 peak in the differential distribution represents a clear signature of the octet mechanism that we regard as strong motivation for continued analyses by the lep experimental groups .",
    "a measurement of the first moment would be a particularly interesting .",
