    "consists of enhancing the color gauge group to @xmath4 , which is spontaneously broken to the diagonal @xmath5 subgroup .",
    "ordinary qcd is then identified with this diagonal unbroken gauge group , containing the usual massless gluon color - octet . the spontaneous symmetry breaking produces , furthermore , a set of massive color - octet gauge bosons , which we generically refer to as colorons .",
    "spontaneous breaking of the enhanced color symmetry may be facilitated in a renormalizable manner  in conjunction with electroweak symmetry breaking  by means of an enlarged scalar sector @xcite . as a consequence , new ( colored and uncolored ) scalar degrees of freedom are present in this formalism ; most notably there is a color - singlet ( heavy ) higgs - like scalar in addition to the electroweak higgs boson .",
    "moreover , cancelation of potential anomalies  brought forth by the possible chiral couplings of the ordinary quarks to colorons  may require the existence of additional spectator fermions .",
    "hence , if this formalism corresponds to the correct description of nature , a rich spectrum of new ( colored ) scalar , fermionic , and vector particles with novel properties are predicted , the discovery of which may lie within the reach of the lhc .",
    "a first complete study of hadron collider production of colorons at next - to - leading order was presented in @xcite .",
    "the scalar sector of the renormalizable coloron model has also been constrained in a previous analysis @xcite , by imposing limits from the stability of the potential , unitarity , electroweak precision tests , and properties of the 125  gev higgs - like scalar , discovered at the lhc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the latter study presented a brief discussion of the lhc heavy higgs searches at @xmath6  tev @xcite , applied to the additional cp - even scalar of the renormalizable coloron model .    in the present paper ,",
    "we further explore the properties of the additional scalar boson , with a mass up to 1  tev , arising from the minimally extended color sector .",
    "specifically , we discuss the implications of the expected reach of the @xmath7  tev lhc with an integrated luminosity of 300 and 3000 fb@xmath8 for the heavy higgs @xcite , and at 300 fb@xmath8 for the detailed properties of the discovered 125  gev higgs @xcite .",
    "if no signal of a heavy scalar is found nor any deviations from the current measurements of the 125  gev higgs detected by the @xmath7  tev lhc with the quoted luminosities , these projections will impose complimentary constraints at 95%  c.l . on the model s parameter space .",
    "we present the plots depicting the current exclusion limits , as well as the projected 14  tev exclusion limits , for three selected scenarios with 0 , 1 , and 3 spectator fermion generations , varying the remaining free parameters within each model to demonstrate the sensitivity of the analyses to these variables .",
    "we show thatthe large regions of the parameter space are sensitive to future probing by the lhc .    in section  [ review ]",

    "we further discuss the results in section  [ disc ] for the different models and their ranges of free parameters , and we demonstrate that all scenarios may be fully explored by the lhc . if no heavy scalar is discovered at or below a 1  tev mass , the searches will exclude the renormalizable coloron model within the tev range .",
    "furthermore , we elaborate on distinguishing a potentially discovered heavy scalar , originating from the renormalizable coloron model , from other color - singlet `` higgs portal '' scenarios @xcite . finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ concl ] .",

    "no spectators are required when all quarks are vectorially charged under the extended color group , since no anomaly will be introduced .",
    "if , however , the chiral couplings of the third quark generation are chosen to be opposite to those of the first two generations , then one spectator generation ( one up - like and one down - like spectator ) is necessary .",
    "flavor - universal chiral interactions of the quarks under the enlarged color gauge group require , on the other hand , three generations of spectator fermions to cancel all anomalies .",
    "following @xcite , we shall study the phenomenological results for three cases described above , where 0 , 1 , or 3 spectator quark generations may be present in the theory .    in summary ,",

    "within each @xmath87 scenario , it is evident that a larger singlet vev , @xmath103 , enlarges the viable parameter space by alleviating the exclusion constraints , and , at the same time , accommodates heavier scalar color - octets .",
    "moreover , for the different signs of the mixing angle , @xmath38 , one observes an asymmetry in all lhc @xmath1 and @xmath0 searches and projections , indicating the sensitivity of these analyses to this sign .",
    "the origin of this sensitivity may be traced back to the constructive or destructive role played by the sign in the heavy @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) production via gluon fusion ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "it is , furthermore , interesting to note that the pseudoscalar mass , @xmath114 , has the effect of determining the lower bound on the mass of the heavy @xmath0  scalar near the @xmath115 region .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath0  decay channel into a pair of pseudoscalars is proportional to @xmath116 and becomes accessible at a lower @xmath89 for a lighter @xmath84 , further suppressing its decay branching ratios into pairs of vector bosons .",
    "as anticipated , the projections demonstrate that the @xmath7  tev lhc is far more sensitive to a potential heavy scalar signal than the @xmath6  tev searches already carried out .",
    "in fact , the heavy @xmath0  boson projections with 300  ft@xmath8 luminosity already cover practically the entire remaining region of the parameter space in all possible scenarios , except for the very high singlet vev and color - octet masses ( deep in the tev region ) that are only available within the @xmath110 scenario .",
    "this signals the interesting predictive power of the model , which can be thoroughly probed by the imminent lhc searches .",
    "given this increased sensitivity , in case no heavy higgs signal is detected by the lhc at @xmath7  tev , the displayed projections at 300  ft@xmath8 tightly constrain at 95%  c.l . the model s parameter space , while the 3000  ft@xmath8 luminosity data ( not shown ) completely rule out the model in the depicted region of interest ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ allmu ] ) .    a comparison of the three models with different spectator generation contents , as presented in figs",
    ".  [ resultnq0]-[resultnq3 ] , reveals that the model with three spectator fermion generation ( @xmath110 ) is the scenario that is least constrained by the current theoretical and experimental exclusions for a wide range of the free parameters , such as the scalar color - octet mass and the singlet vev .",
    "this is attributable to the large cancellation occurring between the coloron and spectator contributions in the effective @xmath0  coupling to the gluon pair .",
    "the projected bounds on the properties of the @xmath1  higgs , on the other hand , do not suffer from such cancellations in this region of parameter space and become relevant , providing additional potential constraints at 300  ft@xmath8 .",
    "consequently , in all three cases , it is generally true that nearly the entire parameter space of the models lies within reach of the @xmath3  tev lhc .",
    "finally , let us elaborate on how a potential discovery of a heavy scalar boson by the lhc may be identified with the @xmath0  boson of the minimally extended color sector . as discussed in section  [ review ] , within the context of the renormalizable coloron model , the heavy @xmath0  boson",
    "is necessarily accompanied by a multitude of additional scalar , vector , and fermionic degrees of freedom .",

    "a heavy @xmath0  scalar  in contrast with the scalar in many other proposed `` higgs portal '' models @xcite  is likely to be discovered in association with other ( colored ) resonances of comparable mass .",
    "moreover , the existence of these additional colored states may enhance the effective gluon coupling to the heavy @xmath0  boson , potentially compensating for the suppressed coefficient proportional to the small mixing angle ( @xmath38 ) , which is favored by the current experimental constraints .- boson , another potential distinguishing feature of this state .",
    "] this may , in turn , enhance the heavy higgs production cross section  an effect absent in the color - singlet higgs portal extensions  and potentially visible in the global fitting analyses of the data .",
    "we have studied the collider phenomenology of a heavy color - singlet scalar boson originating in models with a minimally extended color sector .",
    "the properties of the heavy scalar ",
    "a color - singlet with some degree of weak interactions  turn out to be closely related to the properties of additional ( colored ) states in the theory , which may include scalars , vectors , or fermionics .    incorporating the projected @xmath117  tev 95%  c.l .",
    "exclusion limits , along with the previously obtained exclusion bounds @xcite imposed by unitarity , electroweak precision tests , lhc 125  gev @xmath1  higgs searches , and @xmath6  tev lhc heavy higgs searches , we have investigated various scenarios within the renormalizable coloron model , with zero , one , or three generations of the spectator fermions .",
