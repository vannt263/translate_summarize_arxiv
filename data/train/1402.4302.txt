    "typically , the focus is on the cascading of failures resulting from an initial triggering event .",
    "however , it is also crucial to understand the dynamics preceeding these failures and identify the vulnerable spots where they can possibly be triggered .    to describe the propagation of shock waves on directed networks we use the burgers equation @xcite .",
    "this equation describes flow when the flux depends quadratically on the load ( e.g. , voltage , traffic density , and water level ) .",
    "the range of applications of the burgers equation goes beyond fluid dynamics as it is applied in many propagation processes , such as traffic jams , glacier avalanches or chemical processes @xcite .",
    "here we show that , in the case of perturbations randomly distributed in space , the dynamics of the solutions of the dissipative burgers equation converges to a steady state in which the load distribution is strongly heterogeneous .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the load of some nodes can exceed the average load by one order of magnitude .",
    "one might expect that the location of such nodes mainly depends on the propagation dynamics .",
    "yet , we show that their fate is deeply imprinted in the network topology .",
    "we propose a new topological measure which allows to identify the most vulnerable nodes without solving the dynamics .",

    "the load on the corresponding edges and on the other nodes is determined by solving the burgers equation as described in the section methods .",
    "after @xmath5 , the constraint on the load of node @xmath1 is released and its load is determined by the dynamics . a new node is selected and perturbed and the procedure is iterated .",
    "in addition to the perturbations , at each iteration step , 0.1% of every node load is dissipated .",
    "this dissipation would correspond , for example , to the evaporation of water from a river network , cars leaving the streets , or a potential drop due to joule heating .",
    "_ directed networks_the dynamics is investigated on the european high - voltage power grid @xcite and two network models : the configuration model with power - law degree distribution @xcite and the watts - strogatz model , with small - world features @xcite . in the case of the model networks ,",

    "initially , the power grid and the model networks are undirected .",
    "inspired by the fact that in power grids the direction of the current depends on the node voltages , we use the following method to define the direction of the link .",
    "to each node @xmath1 , a random value @xmath6 ( the node voltage ) is assigned uniformly from the interval [ 0:1 ] and the edge between two nodes is directed from the node with higher voltage to the one with lower voltage ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) .",
    "this method for generating directed edges automatically prevents the presence of loops .",
    "since fluctuations are always present in the network , the direction of the current can vary in time .",
    "our results are averaged over different voltage distributions as well .",
    "_ steady state_[subsec : steady_state]at each time step , we measure the temporal load correlation , defined as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the load averaged over all nodes at time @xmath10 .",
    "the brackets represent an average over the last ten consecutive time intervals of length @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 with @xmath13 .    starting with all loads equal to zero , we observe that @xmath14 decays in time towards a steady state in which the dissipation balances the total incoming load .",
    "when @xmath15 drops below 1% of the relative standard deviation of the loads within the network , we assume that the steady state is reached . in the steady state ,",
    "the load at each node has a well - defined average value with small fluctuations . the spatial distribution for a given realization of voltages in the european power grid is shown in fig .",

    "the majority of the nodes ( more than @xmath25 ) has always a negligible load , while the load of the remaining nodes follows a broad distribution , characterized by a decay in the relative frequency with increasing load and a cut - off for values of load close to @xmath3 .",

    "we define _ vulnerability _ of a node as the probability that it is an overloaded node .",
    "figure  [ fig : power_grid_map]a shows the spatial distribution of vulnerability in the european power grid where the color and size of the nodes denotes their vulnerability .",

    "all the other nodes ( about 30% of the nodes , in dark olive color ) have a vulnerability between 0.1% and 5% . in comparison ,",
    "the highly vulnerable nodes are at least 50 times more frequently exposed to large incoming fluxes . in the case of random perturbations ,",
    "vulnerable nodes are more likely to fail or be congested .",
    "it is therefore crucial to identify these nodes to improve their capacity and to mitigate the risk of failure .",

    "_ identifying vulnerable nodes_[subsec : identifying_vulnerable_nodes]next we will introduce a simple topological property of the nodes to identify the vulnerable spots without solving the dynamics of the burgers equation . according to the burgers equation ,",
    "each node sheds the incoming shock wave among its out - edges and the total load agregated at the node at a time @xmath10 is the sum of incoming loads .",
    "hence , if we track the path of a given shock wave , it is fragmented at each node with multiple out - edges and will stop at any node that does not have any out - edges .",
    "assuming that the time average of the load at a node is proportional to the number of incoming shock waves , we determine the _ basin _ corresponding to that node .",
    "for this purpose , let us consider one realization of the edge directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : weighted_basin_size ] ) . for a given node ( the one in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : weighted_basin_size ] ) , the corresponding basin is defined as the smallest subgraph of the network containing this node ( as the sink ) , which is connected to the rest of the network by outgoing edges . following the procedure as illustrated in fig  [ fig : weighted_basin_size ] , we go through the nodes following the opposite direction of the in - edges , starting from the red node ( fig .  [",
    "fig : weighted_basin_size]a ) , and add nodes to the basin that has only out - edges at the end of the process ( marked by the blue region in fig .",
    "[ fig : weighted_basin_size]b ) .",
    "the resulting subgraph is the basin of the red node , and the contribution of the load of the nodes in the basin is simply the inverse of their out - degree ( fig .",
    "[ fig : weighted_basin_size]c ) , except for the initial ( red ) node , that contributes to the load with unity .",
    "this choice of the contribution of the nodes in the basin is based on the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : network_discretization ] ) conserves the flux at each node . for simplicity",
    ", we assume here that the amplitude of the shock waves leaving a node is on average the same for each out - edge .",
    "we calculated the size of the basins for each node , defined as the sum of contributions from all nodes inside the basin of the corresponding node .",
    "this basin size ( which is determined for one voltage distribution ) is then averaged over different voltage configurations .",
    "the resulting basin size distribution is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_grid_map]b for the power - grid network .",
    "one sees that for this network , the distribution of the node - basin size is very similar to the distribution of the vulnerability .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the two properties can be given by their correlation .",
    "thus , we plot the rank - rank scatter plots in fig .  [",
    "fig : scatter_plot ] of the indices of the nodes after being sorted in ascending order by vulnerability and node - basin size .",
    "the plots are the average over 5000 voltage distributions and over 100 different topological realizations of model networks .",

    "are given above the plots , showing strong correspondence between the ranked vulnerability and node - basin size for the power grid and scale - free networks .",
    "the crucial nodes are the ones with large vulnerability since they are more exposed to large loads .",
    "the basin size shows a strong correlation with the vulnerability for these large values ( top right corner of the scatter plots ) , meaning that it is a good estimator of vulnerability . watts ",
    "strogatz network exhibits much less correlation because the degree distribution is extremely narrow , that is , deviations from the average degree are negligible .",
    "thus , for each realization , the differences in the loads from node to node are very small . this conclusion is also supported by fig .",
    "[ fig : vulnerability_distribution ] showing a narrow vulnerability distribution for watts  strogatz networks .",
    "we study the propagation of shock waves on directed networks using the burgers equation .",
    "under sequentially applied perturbations and constant dissipation , the dynamics approaches a steady state . in this steady state ,",
    "most of the nodes have negligible average load and a significant fraction of the total load is localized on a few nodes .",
    "we found that some nodes are more likely to accumulate load even after averaging over many edge direction configurations .",
    "these nodes ( the vulnerable nodes ) are more likely to fail , when there is a finite capacity of the load they can bear .",
    "unexpectedly we find for the european power grid a broad pronounced bimodal distribution for the loads , while for scale - free network the distribution resembles more a power law .",
    "the steady state and thus the probability distribution of vulnerability among the network is determined by solving numerically the partial differential equations of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1d_burgers_equation ] ) on each edge .",
    "the propagation velocity of the shock waves depends on their amplitude , which can vary rapidly throughout the network .",
    "we propose a simpler alternative based on the node - basin size to estimate the vulnerability of the nodes and identify the most vulnerable ones .",
    "simulations on a real network ( european high - voltage power grid ) and on scale - free networks show that the node - basin size can predict very accurately the location of vulnerable nodes while it performs worse for the watt - strogatz network due to its narrow degree distribution .",
    "our results suggest that it is possible to establish a remarkable connection between dynamics and network structure .",
    "although for many networks the node - basin size seems to be an accurate tool in predicting the distributions and detecting vulnerability , it is only the first step towards a complete description of the steady state .",
    "more might be understood by studying the relation between the most vulnerable nodes : under what circumstances are they separated or forming connected subgraphs ? is any local property of the network responsible for a node being highly vulnerable ?",
