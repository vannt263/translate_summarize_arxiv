    "in the last decades , high reflectivity interferential mirrors have been widely used in optical cavities to measure small light polarization variations induced by the propagation in a weakly anisotropic medium such as in parity violation experiments @xcite or in vacuum magnetic birefringence experiments @xcite .",
    "mirrors themselves are birefringent and this is manifestly a problem for such a kind of applications because they induce a phase retardation @xcite which superimposes to the signal to be measured .",
    "this birefringence is due to off - normal incidence and/or to intrinsic birefringence of the mirror coatings . in the case of fabry - perot cavities",
    "the incidence on the mirrors is normal . in this paper",
    "we focus on this type of device , thus on birefringence due to the mirror coatings .",
    "interferential mirrors are composed of a stack of slabs deposited on a substrate .",
    "one slab corresponds to a low - index layer and a high - index layer with an optical thickness @xmath0 for each layer , where @xmath1 is the light wavelength for which the mirror reflectivity is optimized .",
    "while non birefringent stratified media are discussed in textbooks @xcite , and films with a non trivial dielectric tensor have been treated in literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as far as we know , the origin of the mirror birefringence is unknown , and a detailed study of the problem does not exist . in ref .",
    "@xcite computational results are given in the hypothesis that the birefringence is due to only one layer , in particular the uppermost .",
    "the author notices that the phase retardation effect diminishes as he moves the only phase retardation layer down the stack . in ref .",
    "@xcite measurements of the mirror phase retardation as a function of time and of laser power in the fabry - perot cavity have been performed .",
    "the authors suggest that mirror birefringence may be photoinduced , at least partly .",
    "in this paper we present a review of the existing data on interferential mirror phase retardation .",
    "we show that the data indicate that the phase retardation per reflection decreases when the mirror reflectivity becomes better and better i.e. when the total number of layers increases .",
    "we also report new measurements of two sets of mirrors that confirm this trend .",
    "we finally developed a computational code to calculate the expected phase retardation per reflection as a function of the total number of layers .",
    "different cases have been studied going from a fixed birefringence for each layer to a random birefringence for each layer .",
    "we finally compare computational results with the trend of the experimental data .",
    "our study indicates that the origin of the mirror intrinsic birefringence can be ascribed to the reflecting layers close to the substrate .",
    "birefringence of interferential mirrors have been measured and reported by several authors @xcite .",
    "the phase retardation per reflection ranges between a few @xmath2 rad to @xmath3 for values of @xmath4 going from a few @xmath5 to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mirror reflectivity .",
    "all the measurements have been conducted using an optical cavity except one @xcite , where the ellipticity acquired after a single reflection was directly measured .",
    "optical cavities are usually absolutely necessary to accumulate the effect and thus to allow to measure very small phase retardations . whereas a multipass cavity has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite , a fabry - perot cavity is used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the following section ,",
    "the published data are presented in details , in chronological order .",
    "these studies were always motivated by measurements of small phase retardation such as parity violation experiments @xcite or vacuum magnetic birefringence experiment @xcite .",
    "the first study of intrinsic phase retardation of interferential mirrors dates from 1982 @xcite .",
    "measurements have been conducted using a multipass cavity made of two spherical mirrors between which the light beam bounces many times forwards and backwards under quasinormal incidence .",
    "intrinsic phase retardation is therefore superimposed to the off - normal incidence phase retardation but this has also been evaluated by the authors .",
    "the light beam does not hit the same point of the mirror after a round trip .",
    "thus the measurement of phase retardation per reflection gives a value averaged on the mirror surface .",
    "the mirrors have been manufactured by spectra - physics , inc .",
    "( mountain view , ca , usa ) , and their reflectivity @xmath7 is 0.998 at @xmath8540 nm .",
    "intrinsic phase retardation typically varies between 2 and 4@xmath9 rad per reflection . among the 19 mirrors analyzed , two exceptions with phase retardation less than @xmath10",
    "rad per reflection have been found .",
    "the authors called this a  happy accident \" .    a few years later",
    "a new study was again performed using a multipass cavity @xcite .",
    "a set of 5mirrors manufactured by mto , palaiseau , france , has been analyzed .",
    "the authors did not give explicitly the reflectivity of the mirrors , but they have reported that at @xmath11 nm and after about 250reflections the light intensity is reduced to @xmath12 .",
    "we can deduce that @xmath13 . from their measurements",
    ", intrinsic phase retardation varies between @xmath14 and @xmath15 rad per reflection .",
    "the next study was performed in 1993 @xcite using multipass cavities .",
    "only one mirror has been analyzed but this time the phase retardation has been measured directly after only one reflection .",
    "the mirror had a reflectivity of 0.9983 at 633 nm .",
    "it was coated by the laboratory of laser energetics of the university of rochester .",
    "the authors were able to measure the intrinsic phase retardation and the phase retardation axis direction of the mirror in different points of the surface .",
    "they could therefore draw a map of the intrinsic phase retardation showing a clear rotational pattern .",
    "the intrinsic phase retardation per reflection ranged between 3 to 6.2 @xmath16 rad , while the axis direction ranged between 9 and -13 degrees . to test that the origin of such an anisotropy was not due to the substrate",
    ", the authors have measured the phase retardation when the light was reflected on the backsurface of the mirror .",
    "they obtained a result compatible with zero within the experimental error .    in 1995 the first measurement using a fabry - perot cavity was reported @xcite .",
    "in this type of interferometer the incidence on the mirrors is strictly normal , and off - normal phase retardation vanishes .",
    "the mirror reflectivity can be inferred by the cavity finesse @xmath17 given by the authors at @xmath18 nm : @xmath19 . the reported values of phase retardation per reflection are @xmath20 and @xmath21 rad .",
    "besides , their study allows to conclude that the birefringence is not due to the mirror mounts .    in 1996 , a new intrinsic phase retardation of a mirror is reported @xcite .",
    "the fabry - perot cavity finesse was 300 at @xmath22 nm , and we can therefore infer that @xmath23 .",
    "the measured phase retardation per reflection is @xmath24rad .    for the next value reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , a fabry - perot was again used .",
    "the mirrors have been manufactured by research electro - optics inc . , boulder , colorado , usa . the fabry - perot cavity finesse was @xmath25 at @xmath26 nm , and the inferred reflectivity is @xmath27 .",
    "the value of the phase retardation per reflection is given for only one mirror and corresponds to @xmath28rad .",
    "in 1997 two works have been published in the same journal issue @xcite concerning mirror intrinsic phase retardation . in ref .",
    "@xcite two mirrors constituting a fabry - perot cavity have been characterized .",
    "the average value of the reported reflectivity was @xmath29 at @xmath18 nm .",
    "the measured phase retardation per reflection was @xmath30rad and @xmath31rad . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reflectivity was @xmath32 at @xmath33 nm and they have been manufactured by research electro - optics inc . ,",
    "boulder , colorado , usa . the measured value for three mirrors over four was between @xmath34 and @xmath35rad , while the last mirror was a  happy accident \" with a phase retardation per reflection smaller than @xmath2rad .",
    "finally in 2000 , a new measurement is reported @xcite .",
    "measurements have been done on a fabry - perot cavity , looking at frequency shift of the resonance line of the cavity due to mirror phase retardation .",
    "the fabry - perot cavity finesse was about 40 000 at @xmath18 nm , corresponding to @xmath36 , and the phase retardation per reflection @xmath37 rad .",
    "the authors have also showed that the measured phase retardation could be changed by several percents by appropriately injecting more power in the cavity .",
    "phase retardation relaxed down to the average value several seconds after the perturbation .    in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we summarize the existing data on mirror intrinsic phase retardation per reflection .",
    "we give the reference number , the value of the reflectivity @xmath7 , the measured value of the phase retardation per reflection @xmath38 , the number of characterized mirrors @xmath39 , and finally the light wavelength @xmath1 for which the mirror reflectivity was optimized .",

    "this laser is locked to the cavity resonance frequency using the pound - drever - hall method @xcite . the beam transmitted by the cavity",
