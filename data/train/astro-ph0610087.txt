    "interest in the structure of pulsar magnetospheres has been stimulated by chandra and hubble space telescope observations of the crab synchrotron nebula which point to an axial - jet / equatorial - disk structure ( hester et al .",
    "an analogous structure is observed in the nebula of the vela pulsar ( pavlov et al .",
    "a theoretical model of an aligned rotating pulsar with collimated jets was put forward by sulkanen and lovelace ( 1990 ; sl ) who solved the pulsar equation of scharlemann and wagoner ( 1973 ) on a grid numerically .",
    "this work was criticized by contopoulos , kazanas , and fendt ( 1999 ; ckf ) who presented numerical calculations showing that the possibly unique solution is a quasi - spherical wind _ without _ jets but with an equatorial current sheet .",
    "the quasi - spherical wind solution has been found in the time - dependent , relativistic , force - free simulations by spitkovsky ( 2004 ) , komissarov ( 2006 ) , and mckinney ( 2006 ) and in high resolution grid calculations by timokhin ( 2006 ) . however , the wind solutions may be short - lived owing to the fact that a major part of the current flow is in a current sheet which is unstable to magnetic field annihilation .",
    "mhd simulations by komissarov and lyubarsky ( 2004 , 2006 ) indicate that a jet - torus configuration can be generated due to the anisotropic energy flux density of the pulsar far outside the light cylinder .",
    "we reconsider the possibility of jet / disk - wind structures of aligned pulsar magnetospheres on the scale of the light - cylinder distance using a different approach to the numerical solution of the pulsar equation .",
    "we utilize the fact that the poloidal current flow along the poloidal field lines within the star s light - cylinder is an adjustable parameter .",
    "we find that when this parameter is sufficiently large , magnetically collimated ( @xmath0 ) jets form within the light - cylinder and a quasi - collimated flows outside .",
    "the collimation is due to the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the analysis by sl did not include the current flows outside the light - cylinder and this resulted in a kink in the field lines which cross the light - cylinder .",
    "in addition to the collimated flows , we find an `` anti - collimated '' disk - wind .",
    "the anti - collimation is due to the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "these solutions have no net poloidal current flow and no current sheets inside or outside the light - cylinder . thus these solutions are not unstable to field annihilation .",
    "the formation of magnetically collimated jets along the axes and an equatorial disk - wind is similar to what is found in the nonrelativistic limit for magnetic loops threading an accretion disk ( ustyugova et al .",
    "this jet / disk - wind geometry was discussed for the case of pulsars by romanova , chulsky , and lovelace ( 2005 ) .",
    "section 2 of the paper discusses the theory , the boundary conditions , and the regularity condition at the light - cylinder .",
    "it goes on to discuss the conditions for having no jets and having jets .",
    "section 3 discusses the numerical solutions . for the case of jets",
    "we discuss the radial force balance across the jet and the vertical force balance in the disk .",
    "section 4 gives the conclusions of this work .",
    "the main equations for the plasma follow from the continuity equation @xmath1 , ampre s law , @xmath2 , coulomb s law @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the charge density , faraday s law , @xmath5 , perfect conductivity , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the plasma flow velocity , and the `` force - free '' condition in the euler equation , @xmath8 .",
    "the perfect conductivity implies that @xmath9 .",
    "owing to the assumed axisymmetry , @xmath10 , so that the poloidal velocity @xmath11 .",
    "mass conservation then gives @xmath12 which implies that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an arbitrary function of the flux function @xmath15 .",
    "in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in a similar way",
    "one finds that @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , so that there are two additional functions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the function @xmath21 is determined along all of the field lines which go through the star .",
    "this follows from the perfect conductivity condition at the surface of the star , @xmath23 , in terms of spherical @xmath24 coordinates .",
    "this gives @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is zero inside the star .",
    "here , @xmath27 is the velocity at the star s surface , @xmath28 is the angular velocity of the star , and @xmath29 is the star s radius .",
    "thus we have @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 .",
    "the component of the euler equation in the direction of @xmath32 gives the force - free grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation in cylindrical @xmath33 coordinates , @xmath34\\delta^\\star \\psi -{2 r \\omega_*^2 \\over c^2}{\\partial \\psi \\over \\partial r } = -{\\cal f}(\\psi)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( scharlemann & wagoner 1973 ) .",
    "note that the poloidal current density is given as @xmath37 where the @xmath38subscript indicates the poloidal component .",
    "we consider solutions with symmetry about the equatorial plane with for example @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this equation for @xmath15 involves the unknown function @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "it is in general nonlinear .",
    "ampre s law gives @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 is @xmath45 times the current flowing through a circular area of radius @xmath46 ( with normal @xmath47 ) labeled by @xmath48= const .    in the following distances",
    "are measured in units of the light cylinder radius , @xmath49 .",
    "the flux function @xmath15 is measured in units of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the magnetic moment of the star .",
    "the magnetic field is measured in units of @xmath52 .",
    "numerical solutions of equation ( 1 ) for @xmath48 are calculated on a uniform grid in a region @xmath53 to @xmath54 and @xmath55 to @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath58 we require @xmath59 which is the star s intrinsic dipole field . along the symmetry axis , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    on the equatorial plane inside the light cylinder ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "for the closed field lines within the light cylinder @xmath65 . on the equatorial plane outside the light cylinder ( @xmath66 ) , @xmath67 const and @xmath68 .",
    "thus for the open field lines , the range of @xmath15 is from zero on the axis to @xmath69 on the equatorial plane .    on the outer boundaries at @xmath54 and @xmath56",
    ", we take free boundary conditions @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the normal to the boundary .",
    "other conditions have been tested including using equation ( 1 ) and they do not alter our results .      a further condition on the solutions of equation ( 1 ) arises from the regularity of @xmath15 at the light cylinder .",
    "because the coefficient of the @xmath72 term vanishes at the light cylinder , all field lines ( @xmath15 values ) which cross the light cylinder must have @xmath73 this relation determines @xmath42 for the field lines which cross the light - cylinder . in the following @xmath74 .",
    "there are two possibilities :      one is that all open field lines cross the light - cylinder this is the solution put forward by ckf .",
    "because we calculate @xmath15 in a finite size region , @xmath41 is not determined for the open field lines which exit the region at @xmath75 inside the light - cylinder , @xmath53 to @xmath76 .",
    "these field lines have @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "for the cfk solution , for this range of @xmath15 we assume a linear interpolation , @xmath79 , where the @xmath80-subscript indicates evaluation at @xmath81 .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 is known owing to equation ( 2 ) .",
    "note that both @xmath83 and @xmath82 evolve as the iteration proceeds .    for the ckf case , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an arbitrarily small positive quantity . because @xmath86 , this requires a poloidal current sheet at @xmath87 for @xmath88 with @xmath89 the poloidal current flow is sketched in figure 1a",
    "there is a corresponding positive current density @xmath90 due to the lower half - space . inside the light - cylinder",
    "the poloidal current sheet follows the dipole - like poloidal field lines to the star s surface .",
    "this is required in order to have @xmath91 within the closed field line region of the magnetosphere . at the same time",
    "there is a delta - function toroidal current flow with @xmath92 for @xmath88 .",
    "there is a corresponding positive toroidal current flow @xmath90 due to the lower half - space . inside the light - cylinder",
    "there is also a delta - function toroidal current sheet associated with the mentioned poloidal current sheet .",
    "the magnetic field just above the equatorial plane for @xmath88 is @xmath93 , and this is equal and opposite to the field just below the plane .",
    "the oppositely directed fields are unstable to annihilation .",
    "the electromagnetic stress @xmath94 varies discontinuously from zero on the equatorial plane ( by symmetry ) to a finite value at @xmath87 .",
    "a second possibility is that there is a collimated jet along the @xmath95 axis ( and @xmath96 axis ) so that not all open field lines cross the light cylinder .",
    "the open field lines which do cross the light cylinder must obey equation ( 2 ) .",
    "for the other open but collimated field lines ( @xmath97 ,   @xmath98 ) , @xmath42 is arbitrary .",
    "thus @xmath42 is not determined for @xmath99 . because @xmath100 we consider the simple dependence @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an adjustable constant .",
    "as @xmath102 increases in equation ( 6 ) the axial current flow within the light - cylinder ( @xmath103 ) increases . owing to equation ( 2 ) ,",
    "@xmath104 is fixed at each step of the numerical iteration of @xmath15 .",
    "of course , both @xmath83 and @xmath104 evolve as the iteration proceeds .",
    "consequently , we can calculate @xmath105~,\\ ] ] at each iteration .",
    "we seek solutions _ without _ an equatorial current sheet .",
    "that is , we search for solutions with @xmath106 figure 1b shows a sketch of the poloidal current flow .",
    "the numerical calculations of @xmath15 for both cases of no jets and jets were done using successive iterations on a uniform @xmath107 mesh in a square region @xmath108 .",
    "we have obtained the same results for @xmath109 grid for a @xmath110 region .",
    "the initial @xmath48 used to start the iteration consists of the vacuum dipole field inside the light - cylinder and the straight line extrapolation of the field lines outside this cylinder .",
    "convergence of the iterations is measured by the change of @xmath15 between iterations .",
    "figure 2 shows the solution @xmath48 and @xmath42 for the ckf case where there is no jet .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath48 and @xmath42 for the case of a jet flow along the axis and a disk - wind in the equatorial plane where @xmath111 .",
    "the flow has zero net poloidal current flow , @xmath112 and _ no _ current sheets .",
    "the main parameters of this solution are : along the @xmath113axis @xmath114 ; on the light - cylinder ( at @xmath115 ) the values are @xmath83 and @xmath116 ; in the @xmath117 region @xmath118 and @xmath119 ; and on the equatorial plane @xmath69 and @xmath86 .",
    "the numerical values are @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "this solution is _ not _ unique .",
    "for example , we have found an analogous solution for @xmath125 .    the total power output into both the upper and lower halfspaces is @xmath126 = 0.152\\dot{e}_0 $ ] , where @xmath127 .",
    "in contrast , the total power output of the quasi - spherical wind solution is @xmath128 ( e.g. , mckinney 2006 ) .",
    "the jet flow consists of a region of collimated flux within the light - cylinder @xmath129 where @xmath130 , and a quasi - collimated region outside @xmath129 where @xmath131 .",
    "the power flow in the collimated jets is @xmath132= 0.0155\\dot{e}_0 $ ] .",
    "the power flow in the quasi - collimated flows is @xmath133= 0.0595\\dot{e}_0 $ ] .",
    "the power flow in the disk wind is @xmath134 .",
    "thus , about @xmath135 of the total power goes into the collimated jet , @xmath136 into the quasi - collimated flow , and @xmath137 into the disk - wind .      for conditions where a collimated jet exists , the @xmath113derivatives in equation ( 1 ) vanish .",
    "the pulsar equation can then be written as @xmath138 = 0~,\\ ] ] which expresses the radial force balance .",
    "multiplying this equation by @xmath139 and integrating from the axis to @xmath46 gives the radial virial equation @xmath140 following lovelace , berk , and contopoulos ( 1991 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the two sides of equation ( 9 ) obtained from our numerical solution at @xmath115 .",
    "there is a @xmath141 difference of the two sides of the equation .",
    "calculations in a much larger region are required to determine whether or not the quasi - collimated flux outside the light - cylinder becomes collimated at very large distances .",
    "the field solution shown in figure 3 satisfies equation ( 1 ) accurately everywhere _ except _ close to the equatorial plane at @xmath142 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy in this region can be understood by considering the vertical force balance for @xmath143 and @xmath144 where @xmath145 . for these conditions equation ( 1 )",
    "is approximately @xmath146 this can be rewritten as @xmath147=0~,\\ ] ] where @xmath148 .",
    "this expresses the vertical force balance near the equatorial plane : the term @xmath149 represents the negative pressure of the electric field and it gives an upward force .",
    "the @xmath150 term is magnetic pressure due to the toroidal magnetic field and it exerts a downward force .",
    "figure 5 shows the vertical profiles of @xmath15 and @xmath22 .",
    "these profiles do not satisfy equation ( 10 ) .",
    "the reason is that equation ( 1 ) omits the plasma kinetic energy density in all space including @xmath55 where the magnetic field reverses direction .",
    "therefore we include the influence of the kinetic energy density as a term @xmath151 within the square brackets of equation ( 10 ) .",
    "the origin of the kinetic energy is from the annihilation of the magnetic field .",
    "[ a term of this form can be derived from the relativistic grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation of lovelace et al .",
    "the right - hand side of equation ( 86 ) of this work includes a term @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the bernoulli constant and @xmath154 is the lorentz factor .",
    "we may write @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the radial flow speed is @xmath157 so that @xmath158 . ]",
    "thus we obtain @xmath159 where @xmath119 is the constant value of @xmath22 at large @xmath160 .",
    "clearly it is necessary to have @xmath161 . because @xmath100 and @xmath162 , @xmath163 . because @xmath164 as @xmath160 increases , we have @xmath165 as @xmath160 .",

    "@xmath175 which corresponds to a half - angle thickness of the disk of @xmath176 . near the equatorial plane the magnetic field has the form of an archimedes spiral , namely , @xmath177 . with this modification of the disk configuration ,",
    "the global field solution involves _ no _ delta - function current sheets .",
    "this work describes a new solution for the structure of the magnetosphere of an aligned rotator described by the force - free pulsar equation .",
    "this is obtained by adjusting the current flow along the poloidal field lines which remain within the light - cylinder . when this current flow is sufficiently large a collimated jet forms within the light - cylinder and a quasi - collimated flow forms outside of it .",

    "roughly one - half of the open field lines go into the jets and the other half to the disk - wind .",

    "such a current sheet is unstable to magnetic field annihilation .",
    "furthermore , the way in which the configuration is reached is expected to be important . consider a possible simulation experiment where the configuration is reached by dynamical evolution from an initially non - rotating star .",
    "the presence , distribution , and density of the initial plasma is important in that it is essential for the current flow as the star is spun up to a final rate .",
    "the value of the density of the background plasma was found to have an crucial role in determining the inflation magnetic loops threading a differentially rotating disk in relativistic particle - in - cell simulations ( lovelace , gandhi , & romanova 2005 ) .",
    "the transition from one type of equilibrium to another remains to be investigated ."
