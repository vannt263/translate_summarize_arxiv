    "the investigation of the reaction of @xmath6 annihilation into hadrons at low energies accounts about thirty years history of the experimental studies . nevertheless , the understanding of the field is still rather far from the completeness .",
    "more precise measurements of the @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5-meson parameters are needed as well as properties of the continuum which provide unique information about interaction of light quarks and spectroscopy of their bound states .",
    "the knowledge of the total cross section of @xmath6 annihilation into hadrons at low energies and the magnitude of the exclusive cross sections is also necessary for precise calculations of various quantities .",
    "one of them is the strong interaction contribution into anomalous magnetic momentum of muon @xmath7 . tab .",
    "[ tab - hcgm ] shows contributions of various channels into @xmath7 ( details of calculations can be found in@xcite and@xcite ) .",
    "one can see , that the main contribution ( about 87% ) comes from the energy region below 1.4 gev and the dominant contribution ( 71% ) in this region is from the channel @xmath8 ."
