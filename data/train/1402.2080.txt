    "electron and energy transfer processes between an atom or molecule and a surface are extremely important for many applications in physics and chemistry . in nanoscience ,",
    "ion implantation in microelectronics has become an often used technique for fabrication of nanostructures and focused ion beams are used today for nano - patterning and nano - lithography . in plasma physics , the knowledge of plasma wall interactions is of paramount importance to achieve high temperatures and confined plasmas and also , the sputtering and ionization properties of the vessel walls and the plasma have a strong influence on the plasma temperature . in space science and astrophysics , solar wind exchanges charge and energy with satellites . in surface science , low energy ion scattering ( leis ) has become a powerful tool for the analysis and characterization of surfaces and chemical composition .",
    "likewise , ion neutralization spectroscopy ( ins ) is considered to be a technique complementary to photoemission electron spectroscopy ( pes ) . in chemistry ,",
    "catalytic reactions are extremely sensitive to charge exchange .",
    "all these applications make the field of particle - surface interactions a very interesting field .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , this is in general a problem of great complexity .",
    "on the one hand , target and projectile have a complicated internal structure which is revealed during the collision . on the other hand",
    ", new structure appears in the interaction of the particle with the surface which in turn is a dynamical ( time - dependent ) situation .",
    "therefore , a substantial body of work is devoted to the understanding of the relevant microscopic mechanisms leading to charge transfer @xcite .    the two basic charge transfer mechanisms between an atom or molecule and a solid surface are known as resonant and auger processes .",
    "resonant processes are single electron mechanisms in which an electron tunnels from / to the atom to / from the solid when the energy level of the atom is in resonance with the continuum of states of the solid ( see fig .",
    "resonant processes , being one - electron ones , have been described abundantly in the literature , practically for any atom / solid combination , using different techniques @xcite .",
    "besides resonant tunneling , the two - electron auger processes comprise the other fundamental electron transfer processes for ion - surface interactions . in the auger neutralization ( an )",
    "process depicted in fig .",
    "2a , one electron from the surface is transferred to a bound state ( often the ground state ) of the atom while , by virtue of electron - electron interaction , energy and momentum are transferred to the solid creating surface excitations ( electron - hole pairs and plasmons ) . in the inverse process of auger ionization ( ai ) ( fig .",
    "2b ) , an electron bound to the atom is transferred to a state above the fermi energy with the creation of surface excitations .",
    "energy conservation requires kinetic energy from the atom and therefore ai is only possible above a threshold kinetic energy .",
    "auger deexcitation ( ad ) is another two - electron mechanism of charge and energy transfer . here",
    "an atom initially in an excited state decays to its ground state via electron emission .",
    "this process can proceed in a direct or indirect way . in the direct ad ( fig .",
    "2c ) the excited atom decays to the atomic ground state with energy and momentum taken by an electron from the solid , while in the indirect ad ( fig .",
    "2d ) an electron from the solid is transferred to the ground state and the atomic excited electron is emitted .",
    "in contrast to resonant , the auger two - electron processes are much more difficult to describe theoretically for two reasons : i ) they involve four different electronic states and ii ) the long range of the coulomb electron - electron interaction has to be appropriately screened which is particularly important at metal surfaces .",
    "then , auger processes actually do not involve only two but many electrons in the system .",
    "these problems , added to the breaking of spatial symmetry brought about by the surface and the atom , have made the path to a thorough theory for these processes to be long and full of different approximations , leading in some cases to apparent discrepancies with experiments . in this respect , it is desirable to realize experimentally systems where single processes can be studied under well defined and controlled conditions .",
    "this is the case for singly charged noble gas ions in the ground state and metal surfaces of high work function . for these systems",
    "the atomic ground state is non - degenerate with the occupied electronic states of the surface and the atomic excited states are resonant with the empty states of the metal .",
    "[ fighemetal ] illustrates schematically the relative positions of the different energy levels for the case of he@xmath0 .",
    "this is a case study system since auger neutralization is the only possible mechanism of charge transfer .",
    "however , in spite of its apparent simplicity , a complete microscopic understanding of this system has been achieved only recently .",
    "this article is devoted to review the progress made during the last years in the theoretical description of auger charge transfer processes between slow singly charged noble gas ions and metal surfaces of high work function .",
    "the manuscript is organized in the following way .",
    "section 2 gives a historical overview of the problem , describing briefly both the experimental methods and the theoretical approaches to auger neutralization employed until the 1990s .",
    "section 3 reviews in detail the general formalism of a multielectron theory of auger neutralization , presenting first the theory and calculations for the auger neutralization rate of he@xmath0 in front of a jellium surface and then on a corrugated surface . after addressing the problem of energy level variation in section 4",
    ", section 5 is devoted to show the comparison between theory and experiment for ion fractions and energy gains of he@xmath0 interacting with al and also with noble metal surfaces , both under grazing scattering and in the leis regime . in section 6",
    "we discuss the inverse problem of auger ionization , providing comparison with measurements of ion fractions .",
    "finally the conclusions and outlook are presented in section 7 .",
    "atomic units ( @xmath1 ) are used throughout this article unless otherwise stated .",
    "since shekhter @xcite proposed the two - electron auger mechanism , different theoretical work was performed until the 1950s @xcite . in that decade the pioneering work by hagstrum @xcite developed the experimental technique for ins and also established the ingredients necessary to describe ion neutralization in the same way we use today .",
    "it took him several years of research to design and construct a new apparatus that incorporated a low - energy electron - diffraction insert for being able to investigate the surface symmetry and reconstruction .",
    "he introduced the concept of a turret within which the sample could be manipulated to allow a number of different probes or coatings to be applied to the same surface . in the experiments ,",
    "hagstrum directed slow noble gas ions ( usually in the ground state ) at a metal surface at normal incidence , and the emitted electrons were collected using a hemi - spherical cup and analyzed in energy .",
    "in addition to his experimental work , hagstrum interpreted his results using a minimum number of assumptions @xcite . by comparing the energy spectra of the electrons emitted under impact of different noble gas ions",
    ", he noticed that the high energy end of the electron distribution was directly related to the ionization potential of the noble gas atom and assumed these electrons were emitted in the auger neutralization of the impinging ion .",
    "then , the maximum energy of an emitted electron , @xmath2 , should correspond to a transition in which the two electrons involved in the process are at the fermi level ( see fig .",
    "2a ) , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ionization potential of the atom and @xmath5 is the work function of the metal surface .",
    "however the experimental value of @xmath2 was lower by about 2 ev with respect to the value one would obtain using the ionization potentials of free atoms .",
    "this fact was interpreted in terms of a change in the energy level of the active atomic electron due to the its interaction with the surface . in the simplest approximation",
    ", the electron interacts with its own image charge and with that of the nucleus , resulting in a distance - dependent energy level of the form    @xmath6    where it has been assumed that the interaction energy of the neutral atom and the surface is essentially of the van der waals type and thus negligibly small at the distances were neutralization occurs . in eq .",
    "( [ ea - image ] ) , @xmath7 is the electron charge and @xmath8 is the perpendicular distance between the ion and the surface .",
    "then , the observed change of 2 ev in the ionization potential has to be approximately the value of the image potential energy at the distance @xmath9 where the ions were most probable neutralized , obtaining in this way @xmath10 a.u .",
    "hagstrum also introduced the auger transition rate which is the probability per unit time that an electron at a given band energy in the solid will be involved in the neutralization process .",
    "it depends upon the initial and final densities of states and upon the transition matrix elements and final state interactions as in pes .",
    "it also depends on the overlap between the wave functions of the solid electron and those of the ion outside the surface and is thus more surface sensitive than other spectroscopies .",
    "actually the auger transition rate @xmath11 has to decay exponentially away of the surface as the overlap does    @xmath12    with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the parameters describing the auger interaction for a given ion - solid combination .",
    "the most probable distance of neutralization is related to these parameters in a simple way .",
    "the fraction of the incoming ions that have survived auger neutralization at a distance @xmath8 , @xmath15 , has to fulfill the rate equation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ion velocity perpendicular to the surface . with @xmath18 given by eq .",
    "( [ gamma - general ] ) , the integration of the rate equation gives    @xmath19 \\label{n+}\\ ] ]    note in eq .",
    "( [ n+ ] ) that @xmath20 plays the role of a characteristic velocity for the an process . finally , the most probable distance for neutralization @xmath9 is the maximum of the function @xmath21 , since this function is directly proportional to the probability that an ion be neutralized at a distance @xmath8 from the surface .",
    "( [ gamma - general ] ) and ( [ n+ ] ) give @xmath22 .",
    "then for a 10 ev he@xmath0 ion and taking @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the experimental estimate of the characteristic velocity is @xmath25 . when comparing to theoretical calculations by shekhter @xcite and cobas and lamb @xcite , hagstrum pointed out that in general the experimental estimates of @xmath26 were considerably larger than the theoretical and that the much shorter theoretical estimates of @xmath9 appeared unrealistic .",
    "it was also noticed that with these experimental values of the parameters virtually no ions would survive auger neutralization already in the incoming part of the trajectory .",
    "the concepts of distance dependent energy level ( or ionization potential ) , which is today known as `` levelshift '' , and auger transition rates introduced by hagstrum have been almost invariable used in all the subsequent work .",
    "moreover , the belief that slow ions are auger - neutralized far from the surface , at typical distances of 3 - 4 a.u .",
    "with respect to the image plane ( 6 - 7 a.u . with respect to the first atomic layer ) , has been at the core of the interpretation of many experiments concerning ion neutralization of slow ions at surfaces until recently .",
    "subsequent experiments by different groups measuring electrons emitted in the interaction of incident ions or excited atoms of noble gases and different metal surfaces @xcite did not substantially alter hagstrum s earlier findings .",
    "other experiments measured the spin - polarization of the electrons emitted when a beam of metastable he ( 2 @xmath27s ) atoms are scattered off metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in these experiments is that he@xmath28 loses resonantly the excited electron at a large distance from the surface , leaving a he@xmath0 ion with a well defined electron spin .",
    "when this ion is auger- neutralized the emitted auger electron has information on the spin dependence of the surface density of states .",
    "this kind of experiments were generally interpreted in terms of hagstrum s model with the same assumptions .",
    "a different kind of experimental work has been conducted to deduce charge transfer rates and interaction potentials from the analysis of the angular distributions of scattered particles in grazing collisions @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to bombard the metal surface with ions and neutrals at a very grazing angle of incidence @xmath29 of typically @xmath30 with respect to the surface and along high - index ( `` random '' ) direction . under these conditions scattering proceeds in the surface channeling regime @xcite where the projectiles spend a long time traveling well above the topmost layer of atoms and parallel and perpendicular motions",
    "are widely decoupled .",
    "the parallel motion takes place with constant velocity while the perpendicular velocity of the ions changes due to the electric force exerted by the metal surface before neutralization .",
    "since incident neutral atoms do not experience such coulomb forces , the trajectories of ions and neutrals with identical energies and angles of incidence will differ after scattering with the surface , see fig .",
    "[ figwinterjp ] .",
    "thus , by measuring polar angular distributions of the neutral atoms collected from the scattering of incident ions and neutrals , it is possible to directly obtain the amount of kinetic energy gained by the ions prior to their neutralization in the following way . the polar angular distribution for incident neutrals has a nearly gaussian shape , peaking at a scattering angle @xmath31 which is close to the elastic value @xmath32 , and having a width controlled essentially by lattice vibrations .",
    "the peak of the distribution for incident ions is at a different scattering angle @xmath33 , usually larger than @xmath31 for the smaller incident normal energies , and the width of the distribution is larger , reflecting the width in the the distribution of neutralizing distances ( fig .",
    "[ figwinterjp ] ) . from the peak positions ,",
    "the amount of energy gained by the ions prior to neutralization is obtained via    @xmath34 \\label{egain}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the normal energy of the outgoing neutralized ions and @xmath36 is their incident normal energy .",
    "experiments in which a beam of @xmath37he@xmath0 projectiles at grazing incidence and with typical perpendicular incident energies of a few ev were scattered off al(111 ) surfaces @xcite , gave values of the energy gain close to 2ev , in agreement with hagstrum findings .",
    "in fact , since the ion and surface interact via the electric charges they constitute a conservative system in which the increase in the ion kinetic energy due to its attraction by the surface has to be compensated by a decrease in its potential energy .",
    "the increase in kinetic energy was again interpreted in terms of a pure ion- image charge coulomb interaction similar to eq .",
    "( [ ea - image ] ) . with this assumption , and using an auger transition rate of the exponential form eq .",
    "( [ gamma - general ] ) , molecular dynamics simulations of trajectories and polar angular distributions of scattered particles were performed with @xmath13 and @xmath14 as adjustable parameters . in this way",
    ", the auger neutralization rate @xmath18 for he@xmath0 on al was retrieved from the experiments in @xcite and compared to the most sophisticated calculations existing to that date @xcite with identical conclusion as by hagstrum : theory gave too small values of the an rates to account for the experiments .",
    "a widely used technique for surface analysis is low energy ions scattering ( leis ) , also known as ion scattering spectroscopy ( iss ) .",
    "this technique operates in a very different regime of incident normal energies than ins . in leis",
    "the sample is bombarded with noble gas ions at nearly normal incidence and the particles which are back - scattered at a certain solid angle are analyzed .",
    "typical incident energies range from 0.5 kev to 10 kev and the angle of incidence , measured with respect to the surface normal , is smaller than 60@xmath38 . in a common experimental setup",
    "the ions are incident normal to the surface and the backscattered particles are collected at a large scattering angle , of the order of 140@xmath38 ( 40@xmath38 with respect to the surface normal ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the scattering of the incident projectiles takes place at the outermost atomic layers and this is the basic reason why leis is a non - destructive technique with pronounced surface sensitivity .",
    "its field of application is mostly analysis of surface structure or surface composition @xcite .",
    "there are two standard ways to analyze the energy of the back - scattered particles .",
    "one is to measure their time of flight ( tof ) and to calculate from it the corresponding energies of all scattered particles ( ions and neutrals ) and the other is to determine directly the energy using an electrostatic energy analyzer ( esa ) in which case only ions are selected .",
    "the esa setup is mostly used for analysis of the surface composition while tof is used for analysis of surface structure . from the energy spectra of scattered particles ,",
    "one can obtain the charge fraction @xmath39 which is the fraction of the particles that reach the detector in an ionic state and therefore depends on the neutralization probability . in order to obtain quantitative results with leis , detailed knowledge of charge exchange processes at surfaces",
    "is of crucial importance @xcite . in the an regime of leis",
    "it is common practice to use hagstrum s model and eq .",
    "( [ eq - rate ] ) , yielding the ion fraction as    @xmath40    where the factor of 2 in the second exponential on the right hand side accounts for survival in the incoming and outgoing trajectories , assuming for simplicity that the perpendicular velocity @xmath41 is the same . then , a plot of the experimental results for @xmath39 as a function of @xmath42 fitted to the exponential form provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq - p+ ] ) yields the value of the characteristic velocity which can be compared to theory @xcite .",
    "it has been commonly assumed in leis that the neutralization probability only depends upon the chemical species of the incident ion and target atom and is independent of the environment where the target atom is placed .",
    "this particular behavior is often termed as `` absence of matrix - effects '' in leis @xcite .",
    "one might ask , however , why band structure and density of states of the solid play no role in leis while this is not the case in ins .",
    "as we have already stressed , the understanding of the auger neutralization processes at surfaces has been a long standing problem .",
    "the first works by shekhter and cobas and lamb @xcite were later improved by propst @xcite .",
    "he calculated the auger matrix elements using a wkb approximation for the tunneling through the ion - surface barrier , considered as one - dimensional problem .",
    "later on , heine @xcite established some basic properties of auger neutralization .",
    "he pointed out the importance of the screening of the coulomb potential at the surface and argued that the emitted electron came from the first atomic layer .",
    "many works concentrated on the calculations of the spectrum of the electrons emitted in the neutralization process in order to ascertain to which extent they carry information on the surface electronic structure . following appelbaum and hamman @xcite , modinos and easa @xcite calculated electron spectra assuming that one of the two - electrons was localized near the ion while the second one was emitted from the surface . however , other works @xcite parametrized the density of states and assumed an auger interaction to be fully local in the sense that the wave functions of both electrons are sensitive to the spatial region around the ion .",
    "in other cases , both transition rates and transition energies were taken as adjustable parameters to fit the whole electron emission spectra , particularly when the projectiles are metastable atoms or doubly charged ions , due to the fact that different resonant and auger processes can happen in the most common atom / surface combinations @xcite .    in the case of experiments measuring the spin polarization of the emitted electrons , the experimental spin - asymmetry found for magnetic ni surfaces @xcite , was analyzed by penn and apell @xcite on the basis of hagstrum s model of image - potential energy level shift , using two adjustable parameters .",
    "the authors conclude that the spin - asymmetry measures the ni magnetization outside the surface at an ion position of about 9 a.u . , a value of the most probable distance of neutralization which is even larger than hagstrum s estimates . for the case of non - magnetic surfaces ,",
    "the experiments of @xcite were analyzed in terms of the exchange interaction at the surface @xcite .",
    "other experiments @xcite have been analyzed in terms of the exchange interaction not at the surface but in the volume of a free - electron gas , including the production of secondary ( cascade ) electrons and the transport to the surface @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will be mainly concerned with calculations of the auger neutralization rate of slow ions at metal surfaces .",
    "this means that the ion velocity is much smaller than the fermi velocity of the electrons in the metal and thus the ion is considered to be `` at rest '' at a position @xmath43 with respect to the surface . to first order in perturbation theory the rate",
    "is given by fermi s golden rule as    @xmath44    with the matrix elements given by    @xmath45    eq .",
    "( [ matrix - general ] ) is the matrix element representing an auger neutralization event in which an electron of the solid in a state @xmath46 of energy @xmath47 below the fermi level ( wave vector @xmath48 and energy @xmath49 ) , described by the wave function @xmath50 , is transferred to an atomic state of energy @xmath51 described by the wave function @xmath52 which is localized around the atomic position @xmath53 , while another electron in a state of wave vector @xmath54 and spin @xmath55 of energy @xmath56 below the fermi level , described by the wave function @xmath57 is excited above the fermi level to a state of the same spin , momentum @xmath58 , energy @xmath59 and wave function @xmath60 .",
    "the two - electron scattering potential @xmath61 is a coulombic one with appropriate screening . in eq .",
    "( [ rate - general ] ) , @xmath62 is the fermi - dirac distribution function and the @xmath63-function expresses energy conservation in the scattering process .",
    "one can appreciate the difficulty of the problem by noting that , first , the calculation of the matrix elements involve a 6-dimensional integral in coordinate space and then the calculation of @xmath11 a 9-dimensional integral in momentum space .",
    "snowdon et al .",
    "@xcite performed one of the first `` modern '' calculations of the auger neutralization rate .",
    "they used a free - electron model for the metal in which the electron wave functions were that of a simple step - potential surface .",
    "screening was introduced by using a parametrized thomas - fermi type of potential which allowed the authors to calculate matrix elements analytically .",
    "furthermore some simplifications in the summations over electronic states had to be done , as to consider only states having momentum perpendicular to the surface .",
    "janev and nedeljkovic @xcite reduced drastically the phase space of integration by considering only the dipolar term in an expansion of the coulomb electron - electron interaction , thus obtaining an analytical expression for the auger rate .",
    "other authors were interested in the effects of the ion velocity under grazing incidence conditions .",
    "miskovic and janev @xcite introduced the effect of the ion motion in the auger rates , and zimny et al .",
    "@xcite derived an `` universal '' function of the ion velocity to be included in the calculation of the rate .",
    "effects of the corrugation of the solid surface , have been studied by kaji et al .",
    "@xcite using simplified wave functions .",
    "a major step forward was taken in the work by fondn and zwartkruis @xcite who used realistic wave functions for the electrons , obtained within the jellium model in the local density approximation ( lda ) and computed the multidimensional integrals using monte carlo techniques .",
    "however , like many of the approaches above , these authors used a bare coulomb potential or described the screening of the electron - electron interaction in the static thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "they showed that the auger rate is strongly sensitive to the value of the thomas - fermi screening length and thus could lead to unphysical results @xcite .",
    "this made evident that a proper treatment of screening , essential to get reliable results , was still lacking .",
    "the most striking effect of the screening properties of a many - electron system to a dynamical perturbation is the building up of collective excitations known as plasmons .",
    "these are charge oscillations of the electrons with frequency @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the electronic density .",
    "the quantum nature of plasmons was discovered in 1941 as multiple discrete energy losses of electrons traversing thin films @xcite and first explained theoretically using quantum theory by pines and bohm in 1952 @xcite .",
    "these excitations are evidenced not only as electron energy losses but also in the `` shake - up '' excitation produced by sudden changes in the occupation of localized electron states @xcite , eg . , in the photoionization and decay of inner shells @xcite .",
    "the presence of a boundary between the metal and its surroundings introduces charge oscillations at the surface , known as surface plasmons .",
    "they were first predicted by ritchie in 1957 @xcite and have been the object of an intense research ever since @xcite , giving rise in our days to the emergent field of plasmonics @xcite .",
    "the frequency of a surface plasmon depends , of course , on the geometry of the boundary . for the case of a planar surface",
    "we are interested in , and assuming the external perturbation to be of infinite wavelength or , equivalently very short wave vector , it is given by @xmath66 .",
    "it can be shown from general grounds @xcite that the frequency of the surface plasmon depends on the component of the wave vector parallel to the surface @xmath67 as    @xmath68 ) , \\label{surface - plasmon}\\ ] ]    where the length @xmath69 is in general a complex quantity describing the screening properties of the metal surface .",
    "its real part , @xmath70 $ ] , which is directly responsible for the surface plasmon relation of dispersion expressed by eq .",
    "( [ surface - plasmon ] ) , is related to the center of gravity of the charge density induced at the surface , and its imaginary part describes the absorption of energy by the surface @xcite .",
    "the fact that the surface plasmon energy acquires an imaginary part indicates that the collective mode decays into the incoherent excitation of electron - hole pairs .",
    "when an ion undergoes auger neutralization close to a metal surface , energy and momentum are transferred from the ion to the surface that can excite not only electron - hole pairs ( auger electrons ) but surface plasmons as well .",
    "this last mechanism is only possible if the associated frequency @xmath71 and wave vector parallel to the surface @xmath67 match those of the plasmon .",
    "the surface - plasmon assisted channel for auger neutralization was first introduced by apell in the case of the direct auger deexcitation process @xcite and later by almulhem and girardeau for studying neutralization of protons in al @xcite .",
    "even though this mechanism has been assumed to be important for auger neutralization , it has not been properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "the main reason for it is that surface plasmons and electron - hole pairs are coupled surface excitations ( except at @xmath72 ) and the coupling intensities are not arbitrary , since they have to fulfill sum rules .",
    "therefore surface plasmons and electron - hole pairs can not be considered as different kinds of surface excitations and treated in an independent way .",
    "in other words , any appropriate theory of the so - called plasmon - assisted neutralization channel should take into account the multielectron ( many - body ) nature of the system .",
    "inspired by the formulation in @xcite for the bulk problem , a general theory for multielectron auger neutralization of ions at metal surfaces , based on a dielectric formalism , was developed by monreal and lorente @xcite .",
    "the basic formula for the auger transition rate of eq . ( [ rate - general ] ) ( denoted by @xmath73 hereafter ) is first written in an equivalent way as    @xmath74    with @xmath75 and @xmath76 being the initial and final states of the system atom plus metal with energies @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively and @xmath79 is the coulomb scattering potential .",
    "now we separate the electron which neutralizes the ion core from the rest of the system of @xmath80 electrons .",
    "these @xmath80 electrons are initially in their ground state @xmath81 and end up in an excited state @xmath82 upon ion neutralization while the metal electron , which initially is in a state @xmath83 of energy @xmath84 , ends up in an atomic state @xmath85 of energy @xmath86 . under this approximation",
    "the initial and final states of the @xmath87- electron system are written as    @xmath88    in this equation , the subindex of @xmath89 reminds us that states @xmath90 and @xmath85 have to be orthogonal , since they should be eigenstates of the same initial hamiltonian and @xmath91 .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath79 can be viewed as a density - density coulomb interaction ,    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the density operator of the @xmath80 electron system and @xmath94 is the density associated to the transition from @xmath95 to @xmath85 .",
    "we will assume the ion to be outside the surface of a semi - infinite metal described in the jellium model , the advantage being that the system has translational invariance parallel to the surface .",
    "then , it is convenient to fourier - transform in the coordinates @xmath96 parallel to the surface and , using eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) and ( [ if ] ) , write down the matrix elements of eq .",

    "the largest discrepancies occur at the larges values of energy and angle of incidence , where the projectiles can get near to the surface , and the interaction potentials are more uncertain .",
    "another source on uncertainty is related to the accuracy of the auger neutralization rates , which already lead to the larger discrepancy between theory and experiment in the survival regime for the ( 111 ) surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ionfractionalxxx ] ) .",
    "when we multiply the an rate by a factor of 1.2 we get a perfect agreement between theory and experiment in the survival regime and this also tends to improve the agreement in the ionization regime , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ai_ionfraction ] ( b ) .",
    "we note that the theory gives too low ion fractions for the smaller angles of incidence .",
    "this is due to the existence of surface defects whose effects are more pronounced for the longer trajectories .",
    "further evidence of it is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_ai_exp_polar ] ( a ) where we present polar angular distributions for neutral and ionized projectiles , with a kinetic energy of 7.5 kev and several angles on incidence , the corresponding simulated distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ai_exp_polar ] ( b ) .",
    "for the two smallest angles of incidence the distributions for ions are broad and have a long tail extending to small exit angles , so this indicates that surface defects play an important role .",
    "however , for the largest angles of incidence , the discrepancy between experimental and simulated distributions for ions are most probably due to deficiencies in the interaction potentials , which are more important at the small distances of approach reached for a he atom .",
    "[ fig_ai_exp_polar ] ( c ) shows simulated distributions of projectiles that have never been ionized and projectiles that have been ionized at least once .",
    "ionized projectiles have been scattered toward larger exit angles also indicating that the ionization processes has been produced in a close collision between he and a target atom .",
    "further evidence for it is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_ai_proj_zmin ] which shows the distributions of projectiles versus the minimum distance to a target atom .",
    "the distributions are normalized so that they give the calculated ion fractions . here",
    "we can appreciate that these incident neutral atoms that reach distances shorter than ca .",
    "are ionized with appreciable probability . at these distances ,",
    "the promotion of the he - level is large enough to make the auger process an efficient ionization mechanism for kinetic energies larger than 5 kev .",
    "since the interaction potentials and the lattice vibrations control the distances of closest approach , they are crucial magnitudes , together with ionization and neutralization rates , to give ion fractions and polar distributions .    given that , in the range of distances between he and the al surface where the ai process occurs , the he - level is in resonance with the conduction band of al , the contribution of the one - electron resonant processes can not be ruled out .",
    "actually , when they are introduced by means of a simple model @xcite , one finds that they are as important as auger processes .",
    "[ fig_ai_ionfraction_ar ] summarizes these findings .",
    "the remarkable agreement achieved between theory and experiment should not be overemphasized in view of the limitations and approximations of the theory .",
    "a realistic theory should be based on improved calculations of level shifts and interaction potentials , thermal displacements and transition rates including resonant and auger processes for a quantitative description of charge transfer .",
    "in spite of its apparent simplicity , a microscopic understanding of auger neutralization and ionization processes of ions at metal surfaces has only been achieved recently .",
    "the key physical concepts involved are : i ) modification of the atomic energy levels beyond the classical image potential approximation that occurs near the surface and ii ) the many body character of the electron - electron coulomb interaction requires a detailed description of the screening properties of the surface .",
    "calculations of the auger transition rates using these concepts have provided quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of ion fractions for he interacting with metal surfaces under grazing scattering conditions and in the auger neutralization regime of leis . measured energy gains for the he / al system are also in accord with theoretical predictions .",
    "the theoretical methods presented here should be equally applicable to the analysis of charge transfer at semiconductor surfaces , since experiments are usually performed at room temperature . with suitable modifications these methods",
    "can be applied to the characterization of oxidized surfaces , a problem of renewed interest nowadays @xcite .",
    "further progress in this field requires , first , realistic `` ab initio '' calculations for the interaction energies of different atomic terms in the proximity of the surface and , second , a detailed evaluation of the surface response function by improving on the simple jellium model with the inclusion of the band structure of the surface .",
    "ion - surface interactions are very sensitive to the electronic properties of the target .",
    "hence one should take advantage of previous knowledge and use atoms / ions as a tool to investigate and characterize new materials such as graphene , nanoparticles , nanostructured , organic materials , etc , that exhibit new interesting properties and are promising for technological applications .",
    "much of the work presented here would have been not possible without the benefit of discussions with many colleagues and the frequent disagreement among us .",
    "i want to especially express my gratitude to fernando flores , pedro echenique and werner heiland , who first introduced and guided me in the field of particle - surface interactions , to my fellow theorists jaime merino , nicols lorente and diego valds , for contributing actively to the development of the theory and to the calculations of energy level variation and auger neutralization rates shown in this work , and to the experimentalists whose investigations have been decisive to establish the present new scenario for analyzing auger charge exchange processes at metal surfaces : ral baragiola , vladimir esaulov , stefan wethekam and helmut winter , dominik goebl and peter bauer .",
