    "the original field and the phase - randomized field look staggeringly different , but have the same @xmath0 two - point statistics .",
    "the fact that the power spectrum does not distinguish these fields has been used to demonstrate the need to go to higher - point statistics .",

    "changes its higher - point statistics .",
    "for example , a gaussian field , with higher - point ( @xmath7 ) functions identically zero , will sprout nonzero higher - point functions at all orders if a nonlinear function is applied to it @xcite .",
    "i assert that it is useful to define gaussianized clustering statistics ( @xmath8$]-point functions ) , in which first , the field is pdf - gaussianized ( i.e.  a mapping is applied to give a field with as gaussian a 1-point pdf as possible ) , and then clustering statistics are measured .",
    "the phase randomization already imparts a gaussian pdf to the upper - right panel , so gaussianization does nothing .",
    "gaussianization greatly changes the upper - left panel , though , into the upper - middle panel .",
    "a mapping was applied to give a gaussian pdf of variance @xmath9 $ ] for each slice .",
    "this changes the ( 2-point ) power spectra in slices from the red to blue curves , as shown at bottom right in fig .",
    "[ fig : showdens ] .",
    "this produces a change in both the mean , and , crucially , the covariance of the power spectrum .",
    "the covariance reduction can be seen qualitatively in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : showdens ] , which shows the density power spectra @xmath3  and gaussianized - density power spectra @xmath4  for several millennium simulation slices .",
    "there are wild fluctuations ( i.e.  variance , or covariance ) on small scales of @xmath3  that are not present in @xmath4 .",
    "these wild fluctuations show up as a drastic reduction in the cosmological - parameter fisher information in @xmath3 , i.e. an enlargement in error bars @xcite .",
    "analyzing @xmath4 , on the other hand , enhances cosmological parameter constraints , in principle by a factor of several @xcite .",
    "my proposal is to measure the 1-point pdf and gaussianized clustering statistics together ; the gaussianization step not only reduces covariance in the power spectrum itself , but also the covariance between the power spectrum and 1-point pdf .",
    "a mathematical reason to analyze the complete 1-point pdf ( not simply its moments ) is that , if it is sufficiently non - gaussian , analyzing even arbitrarily high moments does not give all of its information , as has long been known in the statistical literature @xcite . this was pointed out in a cosmological context by @xcite , and @xcite more recently emphasized the mistakenness of the conventional wisdom that measuring all @xmath10-point functions gives all spatial statistical information in cosmology , and the consequences for constraining parameters .",
    "from a statistical point of view , measuring the 1-point pdf along with gaussianized clustering statistics is a superior approach to measuring just the raw power spectrum",
    ". one might be fearful of additional irritants from galaxy - vs - matter bias in gaussianized clustering statistics , but in fact gaussianization automatically provides a natural framework to incorporate bias issues , potentially _ simplifying _ analysis greatly .",
    "suppose the tracer @xmath11 , and matter density @xmath12 are related by any invertible function .",
    "then mapping both pdf s onto the same function ( for example , a gaussian ) will give precisely the same fields .",
    "this fact has long been exploited in the field of genus statistics @xcite ; any local monotonic density transformation will leave gaussianized statistics unchanged in a local - bias approximation .",
    "gaussianization was first applied for power spectra in cosmology by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it does not seem to reconstruct the initial conditions perfectly on small scales , as was the original aim , although it does largely restore the initial power spectrum s shape @xcite .",
    "one way to understand this shape restoration is that whereas in @xmath3 , power smears only from large to small scales , power in @xmath4  migrates rather evenly both upward and downward in scale @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath3  is mainly sensitive to overdense regions where fluctuations contract , and a sort of one - halo shot noise appears from sharp spikes @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 , on the other hand , is rather equally sensitive to underdense regions as well , where fluctuations expand .",
    "[ fig : gausspower ] , taken from @xcite , shows what gaussianizing does for different tracers explicitly .",
    "it uses the mip ( _ multim in parvo _ ) ensemble of @xmath10-body simulations @xcite , in which 225 realizations were run with the same initial large - scale modes ( with @xmath13 ) , but differing small - scale modes .",
    "so each simulation gives a different realization of haloes in the same cosmic web .",
    "for fig .",
    "[ fig : gausspower ] , we averaged together the halo and matter density fields over the realizations , and measured the @xmath0 and @xmath5 power spectra .",
    "in the ensemble , there is a rather clean mapping between mean matter density and mean halo density , a power law with an exponential cutoff at low density ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the correspondence in the gaussianized power spectra is impressive .",
    "however , in this discussion , we have ignored an important caveat : galaxy discreteness . if empty , zero - density pixels exist , this makes a naive logarithmic transform inapplicable .",
    "also , if there are multiple pixels with the same density , then any assumed mapping from a perfect gaussian to @xmath0 is not invertible . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 can be rank - ordered , and for a @xmath0 appearing multiple times , @xmath5 can be set to the average of all @xmath5 that would map to that range of @xmath0 ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "this problem can be negligible , as in the cases of the two figures above , or it can be substantial , in the high - discreteness limit .",
    "a rule of thumb is to use pixels large enough to contain on average several galaxies .",
    "as long as this scale is in the non - linear regime , it will be fruitful to gaussianize .",
    "a promising new alternative is an optimal transform for a pixelized poisson - lognormal field @xcite .",
    "this gives the maximum posterior density from a single pixel in a lognormal - poisson bayesian reconstruction , as in @xcite .",
    "show substantially less difference among the various density fields than the raw density power spectra @xmath3 , supporting the hypothesis that a local , strictly - increasing density mapping captures the mean relationship between matter and haloes . ]",
    "2 cm the usual @xmath0 clustering statistics have large statistical error bars on nonlinear scales , which can swamp errors from sub - optimal measurement . but gaussianized clustering statistics have great statistical power ; with that power comes great responsibility to measure them accurately , which is what we plan to do in future work .
