    "in the recent years the evaluation of the scientist s performance has become increasingly important .",
    "in fact , most crucial decisions regarding faculty recruitment , research projects , research time , academic promotion , travel money , award of grants depend on great extent upon the scientific merits of the involved researchers .",
    "the scope of the valuation of the scientific research is twofold :    * provide an updated picture of the existing research activity , in order to allocate financial resources in relation to the scientific quality and scientific production ; * determine an increase in the quality of the scientific research ( of the structures ) .    even though both aims seems quite obvious",
    ", it is worthwhile to emphasize that the selection of erroneous valuation criteria ( one trivial example would be `` the number of the publications '' ) could have important negative impact on the future research quality .",
    "the methodologies for the valuation can be divided into two categories :    * content valuation , based on internal judgments committee and external reviews of peer panels .",
    "* context valuation , based on bibliometrics ( i.e. statistics derived from citation data ) and the characteristics of the journals associated to the publications .    economic considerations strongly depone of using the context method on a systematic ( yearly ) base , while peer review is more plausible on a multiple year base and should also be finalized to check , harmonize , and tune the outcomes based on bibliometric indices .",
    "thanks also to the major availability of the online database ( i.e. google scholar , isi web of science , mathscinet , scopus ) several different bibliometric measures have been recently introduced and applied .",
    "there are several critics , as those clearly underlined by the citation statistics report of the international mathematical union ( 2008 ) @xcite , to the use of the citations as a key factor in the assessment of the quality of the research .",
    "however , many of these critics can be satisfactorily addressed and our proposal is one reasonable way to achieve this task .",
    "* we agree that the quality * * of the scientific research can not be reduced to citations , but we also believe that the information embedded in citations should be properly quantified * * and should be one component of the valuation of the quality of the scientific research*.    we emphasize that the output of the valuation is the classification of authors ( and structures ) into few merit classes of homogeneous research quality : it is not intended to provide a fine ranking . in the appendix we listed a brief summary of the pros and cons of bibliometric indices and of the peer review process .    in 2005 hirsch @xcite proposed the _ h - index , _ that is now the most popular and used citation - based metric .",
    "the @xmath0-index of an author is defined as the largest number @xmath1 satisfying the condition that @xmath0 distinct publications of the author have ( each one ) @xmath0 citations .",
    "the @xmath0-index is a vague attempt to measure at the same time the production in terms of number of publications and the research quality in terms of citations per publication .",
    "our approach aims exactly to take better in consideration the balance between these two components .",
    "after its introduction , the @xmath0-index received wide attention from the scientific community and it has been extended by many authors who proposed other indices ( for an overview see alonso et al . , 2009 @xcite ) in order to overcome some of the drawbacks of it ( see bornmann and daniel , 2007 bd07 ) .    in this paper",
    "we introduce three novel features in the methodology regarding the measurement of the quality of scientific research :    1 .",
    "the coherency of the research measures 2 .",
    "the calibration technique 3 .",
    "the dual setting .",
    "differently from any existing approach , our formulation is clearly germinated from the theory of risk measures .",
    "the axiomatic approach developed in the seminal paper by artzner et al.@xcite turned out to be , in this last decade , very influential for the theory of risk measures : instead of focusing on some particular measurement of the risk carried by financial positions ( the variance , the @xmath2 , etc . etc . )",
    ", @xcite proposed a class of measures satisfying some reasonable properties ( the coherent  axioms ) .",
    "ideally , each institution could select its own risk measure , provided it obeyed the structural coherent properties .",
    "this approach added flexibility in the selection of the risk measure and , at the same time , established a unified framework .",
    "_ we propose the same approach in order to determine a good class of scientific performance measures , that we call scientific research measures ( srm ) .",
    "_    the theory of coherent risk measures was later extended to the class of convex risk measures ( follmer and schied @xcite , frittelli and rosazza @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of our proposal can be traced in the more recent development of this theory , leading to the notion of quasi - convex risk measures introduced by cerreia - vioglio et al . @xcite and further developed in the dynamic framework by frittelli and maggis @xcite .",
    "additional papers in this area include : cherny and madan @xcite , that introduced the concept of an acceptability index having the property of quasi - concavity ; drapeau and kupper @xcite , where the correspondence between a quasi - convex risk measure and the associated family of acceptance sets - already present in @xcite - is fully analyzed .",
    "the representation of quasi - convex monotone maps in terms of family of acceptance sets , as well as their dual formulations , are the key mathematical tools underlying our definition of srm .",
    "a second feature of  our approach is that our srm are planned to be \" calibrated from the market data _ , a typical feature of modeling in finance .",
    "as explained in section 4 , we _ calibrate _ the srm from the historic data that are available for one particular scientific area and seniority . in this way , each srm will fit appropriately the characteristics of the research field and seniority under consideration .",
    "_ our third innovation in this area , is provided by the dual approach to the valuation of the quality of the scientific research_. as explained in section 3.2 , we establish a duality between the primal space , the space of random variables ( representing the citations records ) defined on the set of journals and its dual space , the space of the `` arrow - debreu price '' of each journal , which could be given by the impact factor of the journal . in section 3 , we discuss this duality and show that our srm fits very well in this framework .",
    "we finally report some empirical results obtained  by _ _",
    "_ _ calibrating the performance curves to a specific data set .",
    "to summarize , we propose a family of srms that are :    * _ coherent _ , as they share the same structural properties - based on an axiomatic approach ; * _ calibrated _ to the particular scientific community ; * _ flexible _ in order to fit peculiarities of different areas and ages ; * _ robust _ , as they can be defined , via duality , through a set of probabilities representing the value  of each journal ; * _ granular , _ as they allow a more precise comparison between scientists ; * _ inclusive _ , as they comprehends several popular indices .",
    "we represent each author by a vector @xmath3 of citations , where the @xmath4-th component of @xmath3  represents the number of citations of the @xmath4-th publication and the components of @xmath3 are ranked in decreasing order .",
    "we consider the whole _ citation curve _ of an author as a decreasing bounded step functions @xmath3 ( see fig.[author ] ) in the convex cone:@xmath5        we compare the citation curve @xmath3 of an author with a theoretical citation curve @xmath6 representing the desiderata citations at a fix performance level @xmath7 .",
    "for this purpose we introduce the following class of curves .",
    "let @xmath8 be the index set of the _ performance level_.  for any @xmath9 we define the theoretical _ performance _ _ curve of level _ @xmath10 as a function @xmath11 that associates to each publication @xmath12 the corresponding number of citations @xmath13",
    ".    given a index set @xmath14 of performance levels @xmath15 , a class @xmath16 of functions @xmath17 is a _ family of performance curves _",
    "if    \\i ) @xmath18 is increasing in @xmath7 , i.e. if @xmath19 then @xmath20 for all @xmath21 ;    \\ii ) for each @xmath7 , @xmath22 is left continuous in @xmath21 ;    \\iii ) @xmath23 for all @xmath24 and all @xmath25    the main feature of these curves is that a higher performance level implies a higher number of citations .",
    "this family of curves is crucial for our objective to build a srm able to comprehend many of the popular indices and to be calibrated to the scientific area and the seniority of the authors .    given a family of performance curves _",
