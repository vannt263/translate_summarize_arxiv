    "focusing of light has drawn considerable attention for many centuries due to its importance in many fields of physics .",
    "microscopy , spectroscopy and optical data storage are only a few of the fields utilizing focused light .",
    "the earliest treatment of electromagnetic focusing problems are due to ignatowsky@xcite . however , the structure of the focused field was not clarified until the 1950 s and 60 s , when wolf and coworkers did the first detailed studies of aplanatic electromagnetic focusing systems@xcite .",
    "here the socalled debye approximation was adopted , where only the plane waves with propagation vectors that fall inside the geometrical cone whose apex is at the focal point contribute to the field in the focal region@xcite .",
    "the debye approximation predicts that the electromagnetic field is symmetrical about the focal plane .",
    "however , later it was found that the debye theory is valid only when the focal point is located many wavelengths away from the aperture , the angular aperture is sufficiently large , and the wavefront deviation kept reasonably low@xcite . in the general case the electromagnetic field is not symmetrical about the geometrical focal plane , and focal shifts may occur .",
    "focusing through dielectric interfaces is of broad interest since this geometry is often used in optical data storage and biology ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and references therein ) . to date , most studies have concentrated about focusing through a dielelectric interface with its normal along the optical axis . however , in some applications it is of importance to understand what happens when the interface is tilted .",
    "for example , consider an optical disk which rotates around its axis in a dvd player .",
    "if the disk is slightly tilted ( e.g. by shaking the dvd player ) , then the wavefront is aberrated , and the focus is distorted . to find out how much the focus is distorted",
    ", it is most common to perform optical ray tracing or use scalar wave theory ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , also in the case of electromagnetic focusing it is of interest to obtain an explicit expression for the intensity distribution in the focal region , since this may give a clearer understanding of the physical problem .",
    "the aim of this letter is to treat the problem of electromagnetic focusing through a tilted dielectric interface in more detail .",
    "first i will formulate the problem , and then look at the small angle limit in the debye approximation .",
    "it should be emphasized that no numerical analysis is given here .",
    "in general , the diffracted field near the focal plane can be calculated in the kirchoff approximation as @xcite @xmath0 ds_{ix}ds_{iy } \\,\\,\\",
    ", , \\label{a}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the wavenumber in medium i , @xmath2 is the unit vector along a typical ray , and @xmath3 the vector pupil distribution which accounts for the polarization , phase and amplitude distributions at the exit pupil .",
    "let us consider focusing through a tilted isotropic dielectric interface when the optical axis crosses the interface at a distance @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . without loss of generality , we let the angle @xmath5 be the tilting angle about the y - plane .",
    "thus , the z - coordinate at the interface is given by @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath7 we have @xmath8 . the unit vector corresponding to a finite tilt angle is then given by a rotation of the coordinate system @xmath9 , where @xmath10 \\,\\,\\ ,   , \\ ] ] and @xmath11 .",
    "here we have used the equivalence between tilting the optical axis and the dielectric interface for a single ray .",
    "we will see that this change of coordinate system is useful for expressing the electric field in the second medium .",
    "moreover , snell s law is now expressed as ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we note that these equations are not valid when @xmath14 and @xmath15 , since in this case we can not immediately assume equivalence between tilting the ( absent ) substrate and the optical axis .",
    "it is convenient to write the electric fields in the first and second media as ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 ds_{1x}ds_{1y } \\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath17 ds_{2x}ds_{2y } \\,\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] to express the electric field in medium 2 in terms of untilted coordinates , @xmath18 , we note that @xmath19 where the jacobian determinant is given by @xmath20 moreover , we must match the electric field at the interface , which gives @xmath21\\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the transmission factor ( fresnel coefficients ) through the tilted surface .",
    "now we may write @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 naturally , @xmath26 vanishes when there is no index mismatch . note also that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by snells law . finally , the expression for the electric field in medium 2 is @xmath32 ds_{1x}ds_{1y } \\,\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{kir}\\ ] ] this is expression enable us to calculate the electric field for reasonable tilt angles in the kirchoff approximation .",
    "in the next section i will study the special case of high angular apertures and small tilt angles , and it will be shown that only a simple aberration term remains .",
    "we now consider focusing with high angular aperture assuming that the debye approximation can be used .",
    "then only the plane waves with propagation vectors that fall inside the geometrical cone whose apex is at the focal point contribute to the field in the focal region .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ". then the influence of @xmath5 on @xmath35 can be neglected , and only the lowest order contribution in the phase remains .",
    "equation ( [ kir ] ) can therefore be written as @xmath36 ds_{1x}ds_{1y } \\,\\,\\",
    ", , \\label{smalltilt}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the solid angle formed by all the geometrical rays , @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these expression were found by expanding @xmath42 and only keeping the lowest order in @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath43 is the usual aberration introduced by focusing through a planar , nontilted dielectric surface , see ref .",
    "this aberration term will be neglected here , which is a reasonable approximation for systems corrected for the index mismatch ( in absence of tilting ) .",
    "it is seen that the tilt introduces a coordinate shift , u , which depends on the tilt and index mismatch .",
    "note in particular that @xmath44 when @xmath45 , which is just the shift expected from a tilt in the coordinate system .",
    "moreover , u is clearly altered when the index mismatch and numerical aperture change . in the further studies",
    "i will neglect this shift , concentrating on the remaining aberration term @xmath46 .",
    "this term is also nonzero when @xmath45 .",
    "however , i argue that it has the correct symmetry , and is a real aberration term due to the finite tilt @xmath5 .",
    "i now assume that the aperture is circular symmetric , which means that it is most convenient to adopt spherical coordinates : @xmath47 and @xmath48 equation ( [ smalltilt ] ) can now be written as @xmath49 d\\phi d\\theta _ { 1 } \\,\\,\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to be able to evaluate this integral , it remains to find the vector pupil function @xmath50 .",
    "this can be done following the guidelines given in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , which results in @xmath51 + b[t_{p}cos\\theta _ { 2}sin\\phi cos\\phi - t_{s}sin\\phi cos\\phi ] \\\\ a [ t_{p}cos\\theta _ { 2}cos\\phi sin\\phi - t_{s}sin\\phi cos\\phi ] + b [ t_{p}cos\\theta _ { 2}sin^{2}\\phi + t_{s}cos^{2}\\phi ]",

    "when @xmath7 , these equations reduces to the ones found in e.g. refs .",
