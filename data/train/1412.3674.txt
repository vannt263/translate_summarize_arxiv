    "in - line holography relates to the original holographic scheme proposed by gabor @xcite .",
    "it is of conceptually simple design , does not include optical elements between sample and detector and has been employed since its invention in numerous experiments using various types of waves , be it light , electrons or x - rays , to name just a few . nowadays , holograms are recorded by digital detectors and are subject to numerical reconstruction , which constitutes the field of digital holography @xcite . a good overview of different types of holograms and the theory dedicated to their formation and reconstruction is given in the book by kim @xcite .",
    "all simulation and reconstruction routines applied in digital holography employ fast fourier transforms ( fft ) .",
    "most of the routines utilize single fourier transform , except the routine for plane waves based on the angular spectrum method @xcite , where two fourier transforms are involved . in general ,",
    "optimal reconstructions are achieved when two fourier transforms are employed @xcite .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "firstly , when two fourier transforms are involved in simulation or reconstruction , the object and its hologram are sampled with a similar number of pixels . for example , if the object occupies a quarter in the object plane , its hologram will also occupy approximately a quarter of the detector area , and vice versa . secondly , when a single fourier transform is employed , all of the following parameters are co - dependent and bound by one equation : the distance between sample and detector , the number of pixels , the wavelength , the object area size , and the detector area size .",
    "thus , the correct reconstruction , provided all distances are given by the experimental arrangement , can be achieved only at a certain fixed number of pixels , which is highly inconvenient . on the other hand ,",
    "a calculation of wave propagation that employs two fourier transforms makes it possible to avoid such dependency on the number of pixels . here",
    ", we summarize simple methods for simulation and reconstruction of holograms with both plane and spherical waves . all of the algorithms described here employ two fourier transforms .",
    "some of the methods described here , have been employed in previous studies @xcite but not been discussed in detail .",
    "by definition , in in - line holography , the reference wave and the object wave share the same optical axis . typically , the experiment is realized as follows : a wave passes by an object located at positions in the plane .",
    "part of the wave is scattered by the object , thus creating the object wave @xmath0 , and the unscattered part of the wave forms the reference wave @xmath1 .",
    "the two waves interfere beyond the object and the interference pattern recorded at some distance is named the hologram . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] two in - line holography schemes are displayed utilizing plane respectively spherical waves .",
    "in - line holography with spherical waves is also called gabor holography @xcite .",
    "the incident wave distribution is described by @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being coordinates in the object plane , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting the wavelength .",
    "an object is described by a transmission function @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 describes the absorption and @xmath8 the phase distribution while the wave is scattered off the object . from eq .",
    "[ eq : hf01 ] , it is obvious that the transmission function @xmath9 where there is either no object or where @xmath10 and @xmath11 implying that the distribution of the incident wave remains undisturbed .",
    "this observation allows the object transmission function to be rewritten as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a perturbation imposed onto the reference wave , not necessarily a small term however .",
    "equation [ eq : hf02 ] is just a mathematical representation to allow for separating contributions from reference respectively object wave . the wavefront distribution beyond the object , the so - called exit wave , is then described by :    @xmath14    where the first term describes the reference and the second term describes the object wave .",
    "the propagation of the wave towards the detector is described by the fresnel - kirchhoff diffraction formula :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes the distance between a point in the object plane @xmath17 and a point in the detector plane @xmath18 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the distribution of the two waves at a detector positioned in the plane @xmath21 is described by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the transmission of the recorded hologram is therefore given by :    @xmath24    where the first term is the constant background created by the reference wave alone , the second term is assumed to be small compared to the strong reference wave term , and the last two terms give rise to the interference pattern observed in the hologram .    before reconstruction",
    ", the hologram must be normalized by division with the background ]    the background image is recorded under the exact same experimental conditions as the hologram , but without the object being present .",
    "the distribution of the normalized hologram    @xmath25    does thus not depend on such factors as the intensity of the incident or reference wave or detector and camera sensitivity .",
    "after the normalization procedure , the hologram can be reconstructed by applying routines that are described below .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath26 leaves only the interference term , which approaches @xmath27 wherever the object wave approaches @xmath27 , for example at the edges of the hologram .",
    "thus , the hologram @xmath28 has a smaller folding - fringe effect on its edges due to fourier transformation .",
    "in addition , an apodization cosine window filter is applied to the hologram to minimize effects due to the edges of the hologram caused by the digital fourier transform ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the reconstruction of a digital hologram consists of a multiplication of the hologram with the reference wave @xmath22 followed by back - propagation to the object plane based on the fresnel - kirchhoff diffraction integral :    @xmath29    the wavefront reconstructed from @xmath28 corresponds to @xmath13 and @xmath26 should be added to the reconstruction to obtain the transmission function @xmath30 as follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : hf02 ] .",
    "finally , eq . [ eq : hf01 ] is applied to extract absorption and phase distributions of the imaged object .",
    "in this section we describe methods of simulating and reconstructing holograms created with plane waves , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig:1](a ) .",
    "a plane wave is described by a complex - valued distribution @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are the components of the wave vector . by selecting the optical axis along the propagation of the plane wave ,",
    "we obtain @xmath33 , and by choosing the origin of the @xmath34-axis so that @xmath35 at the object location , we obtain the incident wave :    @xmath36    the exit wave behind the object given by eq .",
    "[ eq : hf03 ] equals : @xmath37    the wave propagating from the object plane @xmath38 towards the detector plane @xmath39 is described by the fresnel - kirchhoff diffraction formula , see eq .",

    "[ eq : pw03 ] turns into :    @xmath45    where the constant phase factor was neglected . equation [ eq : pwfa02 ] can be re - written in the form of a convolution    @xmath46    of the object transmission function @xmath30 with the fresnel function :    @xmath47    whose fourier transform @xmath48 is given by :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 denote the fourier domain coordinates .",
    "it is important to note that for calculating the convolution , instead of computing @xmath51 in real space and taking its fourier transform , as it is for example done in @xcite , it is better to directly calculate @xmath52 using eq .",
    "[ eq : pwfa05 ] , as it allows for correct sampling .",
    "the coordinates in the object plane and in the fourier plane are sampled as explained in appendix b. the pixel size in the fourier domain @xmath53 is given by the digital fourier transform equation , see eq .",
    "[ eq : b7 ] :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the area size , @xmath56 denotes the number of pixels , and @xmath57 is the pixel size in the hologram plane . in in - line holography with plane waves , the pixel size in the hologram plane",
    "@xmath57 is equal to that in the object plane .",
    "the hologram simulation consists of the following steps :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in the algorithms for in - line holography with spherical waves , the size of a pixel in the hologram plane is equal to the size of a pixel in the object plane multiplied by the magnification factor @xmath58 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : swpa08 ] .",
    "similar arguments as in the discussion above on resolution concerning in - line holography with plane waves , also apply here .",
    "the practical resolution limit , intrinsic to an in - line hologram recorded with spherical waves , can be estimated from the highest frequency observed in its fourier spectrum .",
    "the formula of the resolution , similar to eq .",

    "it is worth noting that the reconstruction algorithms presented here consist of similar steps regardless of the wavefront shape : inverse fourier transform and multiplication with the spherical phase factor followed by a fourier transform .",
    "the spherical wave factor is given by @xmath62 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : pwfa05 ] :    @xmath63    in the case of plane waves and by @xmath64 in the case of spherical waves .",

    "prior to the reconstruction , an apodization cosine - filter is applied to the edges of the normalized hologram to minimize digital fourier transform artefacts that would otherwise arise due to a step - like intensity drop at the rim of the holographic record ( see appendix a).,width=453 ]    moreover , eq .",
    "[ eq : pwsw05 ] implies that a uniquely defined factor @xmath86 can be assigned to any hologram .",
    "consequently , holograms recorded with variable wavelengths , screen sizes or source - detector distances can uniquely be reconstructed as long as @xmath86 remains constant .",
    "this approach however is only valid for a thin object which can be assumed to be in one plane , or when the reconstruction at a certain plane within object distribution must be obtained .",
    "when reconstructing a truly three - dimensional object by obtaining a sequence of object distribution at different @xmath34 distances from the hologram , one must adjust the geometrical parameters at each reconstruction distance .",
    "for example , from eq .",
    "[ eq : pwsw06 ] it can be seen that the size of the reconstructed area is scaled with the distance @xmath34 .",
    "during the reconstruction procedure , the inverse fourier transform of a hologram is multiplied with the spherical phase term , which for example in the case of plane waves equals to    @xmath87    such a spherical phase function is correctly simulated with @xmath88 pixels when it can be reduced to    @xmath89    where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the pixel numbers .",
    "taking into account the sampling @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and substituting @xmath53 from eq .",
    "[ eq : pwfa06 ] , we obtain the following condition for correct sampling ( at nyquist or higher frequency ) of the spherical phase term :    @xmath94    this condition allows selecting optimal experimental parameters .",
    "we have presented simple recipes for the numerical reconstruction of in - line holograms recorded with plane and spherical waves .",
    "these methods are wavelength - independent and can thus be applied to holograms recorded with any kind of radiation exhibiting wave nature .",
    "moreover , reconstructions of both absorbing as well as phase shifting properties of objects can be achieved .",
    "we also demonstrated that any digital hologram can be assigned a uniquely defined parameter which defines its digital reconstruction .    * acknowledgments *    financial support by the swiss national science foundation and the university of zurich are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "before reconstruction , the normalized hologram given by eq . [",
    "eq : hf07 ] is multiplied with an apodization cosine filter to smooth the intensity at the hologram edges down to zero and thus minimize the effects on the edges of the hologram due to digital fourier transform .",
    "the cosine filter is mathematically described by the function    @xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    where @xmath98 and @xmath99 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the analytical fourier transform connecting two domains is given by :    @xmath100    the fast fourier transform is calculated by using the following expression :    @xmath101    @xmath102    where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the pixel numbers .",
    "for a numerical calculation of the analytical transform by means of fft , the distribution @xmath103 has to be sampled in @xmath3 coordinates . assuming that the center of the coordinate system @xmath3 is at the center of the distribution @xmath103 , the sampling is done at the points    @xmath104    @xmath105    and in the fourier domain :    @xmath106    @xmath107    here @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the pixel sizes in the two domains respectively , given by :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the sizes of the areas in the related domains .    for the phase term in eq .",
