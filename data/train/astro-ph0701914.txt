    "the most general perturbation of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background is the superimposition of scalar , vector and tensor modes @xcite .",
    "scalar modes describe mass fluctuations , tensor modes are gravitational waves , and vector modes are vortical peculiar velocity fields . these last modes are not usually considered because they are not produced either during inflation or in other phase transitions produced by scalar fields in the early universe ; however , there are vector perturbations in brane - world cosmologies @xcite and also in models with appropriate topological defects @xcite . whatever the origin of the vector modes may be , we are interested in their possible effects .",
    "the analysis of some of these effects is our main goal .",
    "five decades ago , skrotskii @xcite used maxwell equations and a perturbation of the minkowski metric ( describing a slowly rotating body ) , to conclude that the polarization vector rotates as the radiation crosses this space - time . this rotation (",
    "hereafter called the skrotskii effect ) is analogous to that produced by magnetic fields ( faraday effect ) ; however , its origin is gravitational and it is wavelength independent .",
    "see references @xcite@xcite for estimates of skrotskii rotations in several space - times . here , these rotations are calculated in a new case : a perturbed flat frw universe including large scale vector modes .    in the geometrical optics approximation ,",
    "the polarization vector lies in the 2-plane orthogonal to the line of sight , where a basis must be chosen to define an orientation angle , @xmath2 , for the polarization vector ( that formed by this vector and another one of the chosen basis ) .",
    "the polarization angle @xmath2 varies along the light trajectory because the basis is not parallely transported along the null geodesics , whereas the polarization vector parallely propagates .",
    "this idea ( interpretation of the skrotskii effect @xcite ) is used in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] to derive an integral formula giving the total variation , @xmath3 , of the polarization direction , from emission to observation .",
    "our general formula is used to prove that , in a flat frw universe with vector perturbations , the angle @xmath4 depends on both the source redshift @xmath5 and the observation direction ( unit vector @xmath6 ) .",
    "the following question arises : which are the main effects produced by this type of rotations ?",
    "since skrotskii rotations change the polarization orientations and the changes are different for distinct point sources ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependence ) , the statistical properties of an initial distribution ( at emission time ) of polarization angles is expected to be altered by the skrotskii rotations .",
    "these statistical effects are the kind of effects we are looking for .",
    "could we measure these effects under some conditions ? which are the most interesting cosmological sources of polarized radiation to be studied from a statistical point of view ?",
    "two types of cosmological sources are considered : the points of the last scattering surface , which can be considered as the sources of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and the distribution of quasars .",
    "both cases are studied in next sections by using appropriate simulations .",
    "skrotskii rotations alter the initial angular correlations ( at @xmath7 ) of the cmb polarization . in other words",
    ", they change the e and b - polarization modes ( see sec .",
    "[ sec6a ] ) .",
    "moreover , these rotations induce correlations in the random initial distribution of quasar polarization orientations .",
    "this effect remember us : ( 1 ) observations based on the analysis of radio emission from quasars ( reported by birch @xcite at the early eighties ) , which let to the conclusion that the orientations of the quasar polarization vectors are not random , and ( 2 ) recent polarimetric observations of hundreds of optical quasars @xcite , which strongly suggest that the observed polarization vectors are coherently oriented over huge regions having sizes of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "see @xcite @xcite and @xcite for some explanation of this type of observation in the arena of _ new physics_.    birch proposed a global rotation of the universe to explain his observations and , moreover , a rotating bianchi type-@xmath9 universe has been recently proposed @xcite to explain some features of the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) angular power spectrum ( low multipoles , asymmetry , non - gaussian cold spots and so on ) . in this paper , vector modes with appropriate scales",
    "are proposed against a global rotation to study both correlations in quasar polarization directions and some cmb properties .",
    "since the evolution of nonlinear distributions of vector modes has not been described yet , we are constrained to work in the linear case .",
    "the analysis of temperature maps of the cmb , galaxy surveys , and far supernovae lead to the so - called _ concordance cosmological model _ , which is a perturbation of the flat frw background with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant . by this reason ,",

    "<S> various effects produced by vector perturbations ( vortical peculiar velocity fields ) of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker background are considered . in the presence of this type of perturbations </S>",
    "<S> , the polarization vector rotates . </S>",
    "<S> a formula giving the rotation angle is obtained and , then , it is used to prove that this angle depends on both the observation direction and the emission redshift . </S>",
    "<S> hence , rotations are different for distinct quasars and also for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation coming along different directions ( from distinct points of the last scattering surface ) . as a result of these rotations </S>",
    "<S> , some correlations could appear in an initially random field of quasar polarization orientations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the polarization correlations of the cmb could undergo alterations . </S>",
    "<S> quasars and cmb maps are both considered in this paper . in the case of _ linear _ vector modes with very large spatial scales , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum rotation angles appear to be of a few degrees for quasars ( located at redshifts @xmath0 ) and a few tenths of degree for the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> these last rotations produce contributions to the @xmath1-mode of the cmb polarization which are too small to be observed with planck ( in the near future ) ; however , these contributions are large enough to be observed with the next generation of satellites , which are being designed to detect the small @xmath1-mode produced by primordial gravitational waves . </S>"
