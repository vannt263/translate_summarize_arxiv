    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a widely studied possibility for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its content in the matter and gauge sectors is fixed by all known particles and assumed superpartners .",
    "however , the choice of a two - doublet higgs sector is made purely on the basis of minimality arguments .",
    "it is exactly the higgs sector , namely the non - observation of the higgs boson , that casts a shadow on the whole mssm .",
    "it is becoming obvious that if the mssm is the correct description of nature then the supersymmetric ( susy ) spectrum has to be quite unusual : heavy enough that sparticles escape direct detection , but not so heavy that electroweak symmetry breaking becomes unnatural . and",
    ", if the sparticles are not particularly heavy , the mssm parameters must be special enough that the higgs boson mass is pushed ( through radiative corrections ) above the experimental bound .",
    "another possibility , which does not require any special assumptions about the susy spectrum and parameters , is to abandon the minimal higgs sector , for which there was never any deep reason anyway and which gives rise to the famous @xmath8-problem . in this case , the expectations for higgs phenomenology are modified and the tension from not having observed the higgs boson at lep can be eliminated  @xcite .    a particularly appealing extension of the sm or mssm is the introduction of a completely new sector of particles which are singlets under the sm gauge symmetry . as such",
    ", this extra ( e ) sector would not spoil any of the virtues of the mssm , including the possibility of gauge coupling unification and matter particles fitting into complete gut multiplets .",
    "in addition , e - sector particles would have easily escaped direct detection .",
    "of course , if this e - sector is completely decoupled from the sm then it plays no role in particle physics phenomenology at accelerators .",
    "however , it is possible that this sector couples to the mssm through the higgs fields .",
    "for example , the superpotential can contain a term in which the two higgs doublets are combined in a sm - singlet form . without additional higgs fields ,",
    "the coefficient of this form must have dimensions of mass , and the resulting superpotential component is the so - called @xmath8-term .",
    "in contrast , the e - sector can couple to this sm - singlet form in many ways , including at the renormalizable ( dimensionless coupling ) level . such couplings would have a negligible effect on the phenomenology involving sm matter fields , whereas they can dramatically alter higgs physics .",
    "for example , they would allow the lightest cp - even higgs boson @xmath9 to decay into two of these e - fields if the e - fields are light enough . in that case ,",
    "the usual higgs decay mode , @xmath10 , might no longer be dominant and , since the @xmath11 coupling is small , @xmath12 can be suppressed by a large factor . the strategy for higgs discovery",
    "would then depend on the way the e - fields appearing in the decays of the @xmath9 themselves decay .",
    "they might decay predominantly into other stable e - fields , in which case the mssm - like @xmath9 decays mainly invisibly . if such decays are kinematically impossible or suppressed , then , given that couplings between the mssm and e - sector higgs fields are generically present and imply that the mass eigenstates are mixed , the mostly e - field light higgses will decay into @xmath13 , @xmath14 or other quarks or leptons depending on the model .",
    "although e - particles would have small direct production cross sections and it would be difficult to detect them directly , their presence would be manifest through the dominant higgs decay modes being @xmath15 , where @xmath16 symbolically means four sm fields ,  @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and so on  .",
    "even more complicated variations can also be constructed . ] .",
    "this would imply a very complicated higgs phenomenology .",
    "nevertheless , such a scenario is a simple consequence of having an extra sector which couples to the sm or mssm through mixing of the higgs sectors with one of the extra higgs mass eigenstates being light enough that the sm - like higgs can decay into a pair them .",
    "the situation described in the previous paragraph already occurs in the simplest extension of the mssm , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) which adds only one singlet chiral superfield , @xmath21 .",
    "the very attractive nature of the nmssm extension of the mssm on general grounds has been discussed for many years @xcite ; in particular , it avoids the need for the @xmath8 parameter of the mssm superpotential term @xmath22 .",
    "the nmssm particle content differs from the mssm by the addition of one cp - even and one cp - odd state in the neutral higgs sector ( assuming cp conservation ) , and one additional neutralino .",
    "we will follow the conventions of @xcite . apart from the usual quark and lepton yukawa couplings , the scale invariant superpotential is [ 1.1 ]   _ u _ d +  ^3 depending on two dimensionless couplings @xmath23 , @xmath24 beyond the mssm . [",
    "hatted ( unhatted ) capital letters denote superfields ( scalar superfield components ) . ]",

    "( [ 1.1 ] ) when the scalar component of @xmath25 acquires a vacuum expectation value , @xmath26 , yielding = s. the trilinear soft terms associated with the superpotential terms in eq .",

    "thus , as compared to the three independent parameters needed in the mssm context ( often chosen as @xmath8 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , the higgs sector of the nmssm is described by the six parameters [ 6param ]  ,  ,  a _  ,  a _ ,  ,  _  .",
    "( we employ a convention in which all parameters are evaluated at scale @xmath32 unless otherwise stated . )",
    "we will choose sign conventions for the fields such that @xmath23 and @xmath41 are positive , while @xmath24 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 should be allowed to have either sign .",
    "in addition , values must be input for the gaugino masses ( @xmath45 ) and for the soft terms related to the ( third generation ) squarks and sleptons ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) that contribute to the radiative corrections in the higgs sector and to the higgs decay widths . for moderate @xmath54 ,",
    "the soft parameters which play the most prominent role are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
    "of all the possible new phenomena , the additional higgses in the nmssm can lead to , perhaps the most intriguing one is the possibility of the lightest cp - even higgs decaying into a pair of the two lightest cp - odd higgses , @xmath55 , where the latter are mostly singlets  @xcite . not only would @xmath55 decays complicate higgs searches , but also it is found that precisely this scenario can essentially eliminate the fine tuning of ewsb in the nmssm for @xmath56  @xcite . if @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the usual ( lep ) limit on the higgs boson mass does not apply and the susy spectrum can be arbitrarily light , perhaps just above the experimental bounds ,  certainly light enough for natural ewsb  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we identify the region of parameter space where this situation occurs and discuss how natural this scenario is .",
    "the mass of the lightest cp - odd higgs boson is controlled by the soft - trilinear couplings @xmath42 and @xmath59 and vanishes in the r - symmetry limit , @xmath60 .",
    "however , both @xmath42 and @xmath59 receive radiative corrections from gaugino masses and so arbitrarily small values of trilinear couplings would require cancellation between the bare values and the radiative corrections .",
    "it turns out that in order to achieve @xmath61 with @xmath42 , @xmath59 of order the typical radiative corrections , a tuning of trilinear couplings at the level of @xmath62 might be required , but that even less fine - tuning is possible in the context of various types of models .",
    "quite interestingly , @xmath63 is automatic in this region of parameter space , implying no need for additional tuning in order to achieve @xmath64 small enough to escape lep limits   and @xmath59 of order the typical radiative corrections ( they could , however , originate from an exact symmetry limit at some high scale ) .",
    "we refer to our scenario as _ nmssm close to the r - symmetry limit_. ] .",
    "it is important to note that to a large extent the tuning in @xmath65 and @xmath66 required for @xmath67 and @xmath58 can be separated from fine - tuning / naturalness for proper ewsb .",
    "the value of @xmath32 , as obtained from the renormalization group ( rg ) equations after evolving from the gut - scale , @xmath68 , down to @xmath32 , is primarily sensitive to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ( and @xmath77 if @xmath54 is large ) . in some cases ,",

    "we focus here on the second case because it was identified as the easiest way to achieve ewsb without large fine tuning in soft susy breaking terms  @xcite .",
    "this scenario requires that the lightest cp - even higgs boson , @xmath84 , decays to a pair of the lightest cp - odd higgs bosons with @xmath85 large enough that the @xmath86 signal is highly reduced ( compared to the sm signal ) .",
    "furthermore , it was found that this scenario with reduced @xmath87 is consistent with the observed excess of events at @xmath88 gev in @xmath89 production at lep  @xcite .",
    "the masslessness of @xmath90 in the limit @xmath83 can be understood as a consequence of a global @xmath91 symmetry of the superpotential under which the charge of @xmath35 is half of the charge of @xmath92 . in the limit @xmath83 it is also a symmetry of the scalar potential .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vevs of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , resulting in a nambu - goldstone boson in the spectrum .",

    "[ eq : ma1 ]    naively , an arbitrarily small mass for the @xmath99 is achievable provided small values of @xmath59 and @xmath42 are generated by a susy breaking scenario .",

    ", we always have @xmath352 and @xmath325 and @xmath323 are both @xmath353 . for @xmath320 in the intermediate mass range , the situation is more complicated and we can get cases where @xmath354 and while @xmath355 one finds that the @xmath348 and @xmath356 can share the @xmath54 enhancement factor .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tb50cd3vscd2 ] .",
    "overall , it is clear that if @xmath54 is large a search at the lhc in channels such as @xmath357 could reveal a signal so long as @xmath320 is not too large . for @xmath358 , the tevatron might also be able to detect this kind of signal when @xmath54 is large enough .",
    "eliminating ewsb fine tuning in supersymmetric models has become an important issue . in the nmssm , this is most easily achieved by allowing the lightest higgs boson , @xmath84 , to have mass of order @xmath0 , as naturally predicted after radiative corrections for stop masses in the range of a few hundred gev .",
    "the modest stop masses imply no significant fine - tuning .",
    "however , such an @xmath84 is typically standard model like in its @xmath359 coupling and can escape lep limits only if the dominant decay is @xmath360 ( so that the @xmath361 decay is sufficiently suppressed to escape lep limits ) and if @xmath58 ( so that the @xmath362 final state does not feed into the @xmath363 final state that is strongly constrained by lep data ) . in this paper",
    ", we have considered the degree to which the gut - scale soft - susy - breaking parameters must be tuned in order to have @xmath58 and @xmath57 ( the rough requirement for suppressing the @xmath361 mode sufficiently ) .",
    "we have found that such a scenario need not have significant tuning .",
    "we began by assessing the tuning required of the @xmath32-scale parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 that primarily control both @xmath127 and @xmath170 .",
    "this tuning was quantified via \\{||,||},f_a , evaluated at scale @xmath32 .",
    "we found that so long as @xmath8 is not too large ( @xmath364 ) then the values of @xmath126 and @xmath125 need only be tuned to a level of order @xmath365 , corresponding to tuning in the range of 5% to 10% , for the magnitudes of @xmath126 and @xmath125 that are of order those automatically generated by radiative evolution from small gut scale values .",
    "further , these same rge - generated values automatically give the required large values of @xmath170 .",
    "we also discussed how these tuning estimates based on @xmath129 will generically greatly overestimate the tuning with respect to gut - scale soft - susy - breaking parameters . in any susy scenario",
    "in which @xmath125 and @xmath126 deriving from rg evolution are dominated by a gut - scale parameter or model - correlated set of gut - scale parameters , generically denoted by @xmath131 , the tuning with respect to @xmath131 is given by @xmath366 and for the @xmath125 and @xmath126 regions with @xmath58 and @xmath57 one finds @xmath263 . as a result @xmath367",
    "can easily be very modest in size , even for quite large @xmath8  the opposite - sign correlation becomes increasingly effective as @xmath8 increases .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that gut - scale parameters can be chosen so that fine - tuning can essentially be eliminated for the nmssm scenario of a light higgs with @xmath56 , decaying primarily via @xmath55 with @xmath58 and @xmath206 ( both being required to escape lep limits ) .",
    "we regard this scenario ( or something similar ) as a highly attractive possibility for the higgs sector .",
    "it solves both the @xmath8 problem and the fine - tuning problem .",
    "it does , however , introduce the need for proving viability of lhc discovery modes involving @xmath368 or @xmath369 , where the jets could be @xmath370 .",
    "the @xmath369 mode is certain to be quite difficult to probe at the lhc  only diffractive @xmath371 might provide a signal in the form of a bump in the @xmath372 distribution at @xmath176 . in this regard ,",
    "it is important to note that our work shows that minimizing the gut - scale fine - tuning measure @xmath367 appears to mildly prefer @xmath268 .",
    "thus , a strong effort should be made to develop @xmath368 discovery modes at the lhc and to see if lep data can constrain this possibility .",
    "of course , discovery of the @xmath84 at the ilc through a bump at @xmath373 in the @xmath374 channel will be extremely easy .",
