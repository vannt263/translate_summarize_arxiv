    "layered transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , represent a new class of atomically thin two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials inspired by the discovery of graphene @xcite .",
    "in contrast to graphene , monolayer tmd has a direct band gap @xcite in the visible region and displays strong photoluminescence ( pl ) at the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "moreover , the inversion symmetry breaking and strong spin - orbit coupling in monolayer tmd lead to contrasting circular dichroism in the @xmath5 valleys @xcite .",
    "consequently , the interband transitions at the two valleys can be selectively excited by an optical field with proper helicity .",
    "this ability to selectively address different valleys enables optical generation , control and detection of valley polarizations @xcite and valley coherence@xcite .",
    "these unique properties and recent advances in sample fabrication @xcite make layered tmd promising materials for novel applications in optoelectronics@xcite and the field of valleytronics@xcite .",
    "the optical excitation of semiconductors creates excitons which are electron - hole pairs bound through coulomb interactions . in the presence of excess charges ,",
    "charged excitons called trions @xcite can be formed through the coalescence of an exciton and a free charge or directly from an unbound electron - hole plasma @xcite . in monolayer tmd ,",
    "strong coulomb interactions lead to exceptionally high binding energies for excitons @xcite and trions @xcite , allowing them to exist even at room temperature . like excitons ,",
    "trions also have significant influences on the optical and electronic properties of layered tmd .",
    "for example , trions can modify the overall pl spectrum @xcite in monolayer mose@xmath0 and reduce the conductivity @xcite in monolayer mos@xmath0 .",
    "the interplay between exciton and trion is critical .",
    "the trion state has a lower energy and provides a relaxation channel for excitons .",
    "trions can be excited by an optical phonon into an excitonic state to realize a upconversion process @xcite in monolayer wse@xmath0 .",
    "coherent exciton - trion coupling has also been observed @xcite in monolayer mose@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , trions play an important role in applications such as quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "therefore , a thorough understanding of the fundamental carrier dynamics in monolayer tmd has to include both exciton and trion dynamics .",
    "the experimental investigation of the carrier dynamics upon an optical excitation has been the focus of recent studies based on techniques such as time - resolved pl @xcite , ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy@xcite , optical kerr spectroscopy@xcite , coherent 2d spectroscopy@xcite and hole - burning spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "these studies have revealed valuable structure and dynamic information in layered tmd .",
    "however , the focus has been mainly on the exciton dynamics while the trion dynamics remain largely unexplored .",
    "recent studies of the trion formation in monolayer mose@xmath0 by pump - probe spectroscopy @xcite and the trion emission in monolayer wse@xmath0 by time - resolved pl @xcite have brought the attention to the valley trion dynamics in layered tmd .    here",
    "we report a study of the valley trion dynamics in a chemical - vapor - deposition ( cvd ) grown mose@xmath0 monolayer by using ultrafast pump - probe spectroscopy .",
    "we find that the trion population decays non - exponentially after an ultrafast ( @xmath6 500 fs ) trion formation from photoexcited free carriers . the trion decay can be fit with a bi - exponential decay function . the measurements at different pump fluences show a surprising density dependence of the trion decay : the dynamics become slower as the excitation density increases .",
    "we present a theoretical model based on a set of rate equations that reproduces the experimental data quantitatively for all pump fluences .",
    "the model shows that the primary mechanism responsible for the observed dynamics and density dependence is the fast and slow trapping by two defect states .",
    "the slower dynamics at higher densities is due to the limited density of the defects .",
    "( b ) normalized pl spectra at various temperatures from 10 to 300 k. the spectra are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "( c ) pl spectra at 10k with various pump fluences from 10 to 160 @xmath7j/@xmath8 . ]",
    "the cvd - grown mose@xmath0 monolayers @xcite on a glass substrate were studied . the optical image of a typical monolayer mose@xmath0 flake is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) .",
    "the flakes are equilateral triangles with sides ranging from tens of @xmath7 m to more than 100 @xmath7 m .",
    "the sample was placed in a microscopy liquid helium cryostat so that the sample temperature can be varied from 10 k to the room temperature .",
    "we first performed pl measurements at different temperatures .",
    "femtosecond pulses with the central wavelength at 720 nm were used as the pump for both the pl and pump - probe experiments .",
    "the pl spectra at various temperatures from 10 k to 300 k are shown in figure [ figure1](b ) .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the pl spectrum changes from a broad single peak to two separate peaks with an energy difference of @xmath930 mev . at low temperatures , the peak at the higher energy ( 1653 mev at 10k )",
    "is identified as the @xmath10 exciton resonance while the one at the lower energy ( 1623 mev at 10k ) as the trion resonance .",
    "this assignment is consistent with previously published studies @xcite in the pl spectra , the resonance energies and the trion binding energy .",
    "the pl was also measured under different pump fluences to check how the excitation density affects the exciton and trion resonances .",
    "figure [ figure1](c ) shows the pl spectra at 10 k under various pump fluences .",
    "the spectra are fit to a lorentzian double peak profile to extract peak positions , linewidths , and peak areas ( see supporting information for details ) .",
    "as the pump fluence changes from 10 to 160 @xmath7j/@xmath8 , the exciton and trion resonance energies have a small variation of 1.5 and 0.4 mev , respectively .",
    "the linewidth increases from 15.6 to 18.1 mev for exciton and from 13.1 to 16.65 mev for trion .",
    "while both exciton and trion intensities increase linearly with the pump fluence , the ratio of exciton to trion peak area decreases from 0.52 to 0.38 . this ratio can be used to determine the distribution of the initial carrier density between the exciton and trion states .",
    "the ultrafast pump - probe experiment was performed with the setup shown in figure [ figure2](a ) .",
    "the pump pulse was tuned to 1722 mev to excite free carriers slightly above the @xmath10 exciton energy but below the @xmath11 exciton energy .",
    "the probe pulse was tuned to probe at the peak of the trion resonance at 1623 mev .",
    "the bandwidth of the probe pulse ( @xmath99 mev ) is much larger than the variation in the trion resonance energy .",
    "the pump and probe beams are circularly polarized to selectively excite and probe the transition at one of the @xmath5 valleys depending on the helicity .",
    "representative pump - probe spectra are shown in figure [ figure2](b ) for a sample temperature of 10 k and a pump fluence of 80 @xmath7j/@xmath8 .",
    "the blue ( red ) circles are the data obtained with the co - circularly ( cross - circularly ) polarized pump and probe beams , that is , the pump and probe polarizations are @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the pump - probe spectra feature a fast rising followed by a decay of the signal up to hundreds of ps .        to investigate the rising signal , figure [ figure2](c ) shows a segment of several ps around zero time delay .",
    "in addition to the pump - probe spectra , a 500-fs gaussian pulse is plotted as a dash line .",
    "the normalized time integral of the gaussian pulse , shown as a solid line , matches well with the rising slope of the pump - probe spectra .",
    "therefore , the rising time of the signal is limited only by the time resolution of the pump pulse . for the co - circular configuration",
    ", this indicates that the trion formation time is within 500 fs .",
    "this time is consistent with the trion formation time and its dependence on the excitation energy reported by singh and coauthors @xcite .",
    "the variation in the trion formation time can be caused by the differences in doping density , excitation energy and excitation power .",
    "the spectrum with the cross - circular configuration shows a nearly identical rising signal , suggesting a fast intervalley relaxation time .",
    "this seems contradictory to the observations of a persistent polarization in the pl of excitons @xcite and trions @xcite .",
    "however , the reported circular polarization degree is considerably less than 100% in most experiments .",
    "the imperfect but persistent polarization can be explained with an ultrafast initial polarization decay due to fast intervalley relaxation , in which some carriers lose the initial polarization quickly while others maintain for a longer time .",
    "the partial loss of polarization is also evident by our observation that the amplitude of the pump - probe signal , prior to the normalization , with the cross - circular polarizations is about 30% of the amplitude with the co - circular polarizations .",
    "the reduced trion intensity for the cross - circular polarizations has also been observed in the pl@xcite spectra .",
    "the time - resolved pl measurements @xcite suggested an intervalley relaxation time shorter than the time resolution of 4 ps in their experiments .",
    "our data show that the intervalley relaxation time is shorter than 500 fs and only a part of carrier population is involved in this ultrafast initial intervalley relaxation .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the trion formation has two possible channels . in the presence of excess free charges ,",
    "an exciton can capture an extra charge to form a trion .",
    "this is the primary process for trion formation at low carrier densities . at a sufficiently high density",
    ", trions can be formed directly from unbound carriers through a three - particle formation process . in our experiment ,",
    "the trion formation is as fast as the exciton formation within the time resolution of our measurement .",
    "we suspect that the trion formation at the short time scale is mainly the three - particle formation from free carriers .",
    "however , our results can not rule out the possibility of an ultrafast ( @xmath6 500 fs ) exciton - to - trion formation process .",
    "as we will show in the simulation , a slow trion formation process through the coalescence of excitons and excess charges may exist and lead to a better agreement between the simulated and experimental data at long delay times .",
    "after the rise , the pump - probe signal displays a non - exponential decay which includes a fast decay at the time scale within tens of ps and a slower decay at hundreds of ps .",
    "similar behaviors in the decay signal have been observed for both excitons @xcite and trions @xcite in various tmd monolayers .",
    "a bi - exponential decay function provides a good fit to the data in some cases@xcite while other experiments@xcite suggest that a tri - exponential decay function is required . in our experiments ,",
    "a bi - exponential decay function is sufficient to fit the decay signal . to analyze the decay dynamics",
    ", we use the bi - exponential decay function , @xmath14 , to fit the data .",
    "the solid lines in fig . [ figure2](b ) are fits with the fitting parameters @xmath15 ps , @xmath16 ps , and @xmath17 for the co - circular polarizations , and @xmath18 ps , @xmath19 ps , and @xmath20 for the cross - circular polarizations .",
    "the fit to the bi - exponential decay function allows a global characterization of the decay time constants for all data , however it does not necessarily suggest that there are only two relaxation processes or attribute the time constants to a particular process .    a number of exciton decay mechanisms have been suggested as possible underlying processes in previously published studies@xcite .",
    "for instance , some experiments@xcite show that the fast decay dynamics ( @xmath21 ps ) are dependent on the exciton density and exciton - exciton annihilation is the dominating decay channel , while other studies@xcite show no significant variation in the decay dynamics with the excitation density and that trapping by surface defect states is the responsible process .",
    "other mechanisms such as carrier - phonon scattering , inter / intra - valley scattering , biexciton formation , trion formation , electron - hole recombination and exciton auger scattering have also been considered @xcite .",
    "some of the exciton decay mechanisms can also be applicable to the trion dynamics .",
    "for instance , trapping by shallow and deep defect states can lead to the bi - exponential decay observed in the trion dynamics .",
    "the studies on exciton dynamics @xcite have shown considerable discrepancy in the interpretation of the exciton dynamics and the specific time scales due to the differences in samples and measurement conditions such as the excitation energy , excitation density , temperature and polarizations .",
    "particularly , the dependence on the excitation density can provide crucial evidence in determining the decay mechanism .    to further understand the trion relaxation dynamics in our sample",
    ", pump - probe spectra were obtained with the pump fluence varying from 10 to 160 @xmath7j/@xmath8 to investigate the excitation density dependence .",
    "the injected carrier density is estimated to be @xmath22 @xmath23 for a pump fluence of 10 @xmath7j/@xmath8 by using an absorption measurement and assuming that one electron is excited into the conduction band for each absorbed photon .",
    "the normalized pump - probe spectra at 10 k with various pump fluences are shown in figure [ figure3](a ) .",
    "the squares with different colors are experimental data and solid lines are fits to the bi - exponential decay function .",
    "the decay dynamics show a strong dependence on the pump fluence , thus the initial excitation density .",
    "the extracted time constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 are plotted in figure [ figure3](b ) and ( c ) , respectively , as a function of the pump fluence .",
    "the error bars are estimated from the fitting uncertainties and multiple measurements . both time constants increase with the pump fluence , indicating that the trion decay is slower at higher excitation densities .",
    "this dependence is surprising since the dynamics is usually expected to be faster due to stronger many - body interactions as the density increases .    for exciton dynamics",
    ", the excitation - density dependence can be a result of different processes such as biexciton formation @xcite , exciton - exciton annihilation @xcite and defect - assisted auger scattering @xcite .",
    "similar processes may contribute to the trion dynamics .",
    "we rule out the biexciton formation since there is no evidence of biexciton in monolayer mose@xmath0 despite the observation of biexcitons in wse@xmath0 @xcite and ws@xmath0 @xcite . in a possible trion - trion annihilation process",
    ", the trion density should decay quadratically according to the rate equation @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the trion density and @xmath28 the annihilation rate .",
    "the decay governed by this equation should become faster as the initial density increases , opposite to the excitation - density dependence of the dynamics in our experiment .",
    "therefore , we also rule out the trion - trion annihilation process .",
    "the bi - exponential decay and the excitation - density dependence of the trion dynamics can be explained by the trapping of trions in the defect states through auger scattering .",
    "similar to the trapping of carriers and excitons , a trion can be captured into a defect state through either a phonon - assisted process or an auger process . with phonon - assisted processes ,",
    "the trapping rates depend strongly on the temperature .",
    "our measurements at different temperatures ( see supporting information ) do not show such a temperature dependence , suggesting that phonon - assisted processes are negligible in our case . in an auger scattering process ,",
    "an electron ( hole ) scatters off a hole ( electron ) and is captured into a defect state while the hole ( electron ) is scattered to a higher energy state to conserve energy .",
    "the corresponding exciton or trion is trapped in the defect state .",
    "the defect trapping has been experimentally studied in mos@xmath0 monolayers @xcite and nanoclusters @xcite .",
    "two defect states have been observed to provide both fast and slow traps , which can explain the bi - exponential decay . in mos@xmath0 monolayers , the decay dynamics were found @xcite to be independent of the excitation density within a range of the pump fluence from 1 to 32 @xmath7j/@xmath8 .",
    "however , the density dependence of the dynamics in our experiment can be explained by considering the limited density of the available defect states in the sample . as the exciton / trion density approaches or becomes higher than the defect density , the defect states are filled up and the defect trapping process slows down .",
    "if this is the dominating decay channel , the trion relaxation becomes slower as the initial density increases .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we model the trion relaxation dynamics with rate equations based on the energy level structure shown in figure [ figure4](a ) .",
    "the exciton , trion and ground states are considered in the excitonic picture . the excitons decay through both radiative and non - radiative channels at the rates @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . the excitons can also capture an extra charge to form trions at the rate @xmath31 .",
    "the trions decay through the radiative recombination at the rate @xmath32 and the defect trapping .",
    "we assume that there are two defect states providing fast trapping at the rate @xmath33 and slow trapping at the rate @xmath34 .",
    "the dynamics can be described by a set of rate equations    @xmath35    where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the exciton density undergoing the fast ( slow ) decay , @xmath38 is the trion density , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the occupied density in the fast ( slow ) state , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the defect density for the fast ( slow ) trapping , and @xmath43 is the density of the available trion states .",
    "the photoexcited carriers form excitons and trions in a time shorter than the pulse duration .",
    "the initial exciton and trion densities are estimated from the injected carrier density and the ratio of exciton to trion density obtained from the pl spectra with the corresponding pump fluence ( see supporting information ) .",
    "the excitons have a fast decay channel due to non - radiative processes and a slow radiative decay channel . the excitons also form trions at a time scale of hundreds of ps .",
    "the trion - to - exciton upconversion @xcite has a low efficiency and is negligible in our experiment .",
    "we assume that @xmath44 of the initial exciton population decays through the fast channel and the remaining through the slow channel .",
    "the simulation shows that the choice of this ratio does not qualitatively affect the trion dynamics .",
    "the rate equations are solved numerically for the trion density as a function of time .",
    "the parameters are adjusted by a nonlinear fitting routine to fit all six decay curves in figure [ figure3](a ) simultaneously .",
    "the simulated trion decay dynamics under different pump fluences are presented in figure [ figure4](b ) .",
    "the corresponding fitting parameters are shown in table [ tbl : table1 ] .",
    "the simulated result is in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the simulation reproduces the non - exponential decay and the decay dynamics become slower as the pump fluence increases .",
    "we find that the density dependence of the trion dynamics is mostly affected by the defect densities @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the best fitting requires @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) to be close to the lowest ( highest ) injected carrier density .",
    "the obtained defect densities are comparable with the theoretical and experimental values @xcite of the point defects in 2d tmd .",
    "although the trapping rates , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , stay the same for all pump fluences , the actual decay times are longer at higher densities since the defect states are filled up and the effective trapping rates , @xmath45 , decrease with the occupied density .",
    "the fast and slow trapping by the defect states explains the non - exponential decay and the density dependence in the experimental results , but slightly overestimates the decay rate at long delay times ( @xmath46 100 ps ) for high pump fluences ( @xmath47 80 @xmath7j/@xmath8 ) . adding a slow process of trion formation from excitons at the rate @xmath31 provides a better fit to the decay dynamics at long delay times .",
    "however , this process is not essential to reproducing the density dependence of the trion dynamics . therefore , the trion decay dynamics is dominated by the fast and slow trapping by the defect states within the range of the pump fluences used in our experiment .",

    "the simulation based on the rate equations describing the trapping by defects and the exciton - to - trion formation process reproduces the measured trion decay dynamics for all pump fluences .",
    "the slower dynamics at higher densities are due to the limited defect densities that are comparable to the excitation densities .",
