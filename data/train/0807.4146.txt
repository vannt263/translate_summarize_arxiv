    "starting from a subfactor planar algebra , a construction was given in @xcite of a tower of ii@xmath0 factors whose standard invariant is precisely the given planar algebra .",
    "the construction was entirely in terms of planar diagrams and gave a diagrammatic reproof of a result of popa in @xcite .",
    "the inspiration for the paper was from the theory of large random matrices where expected values of words on random matrices give rise to a trace ( see @xcite ) on the algebra of noncommutative polynomials . since that trace is definable entirely in terms of planar pictures it was easy to generalise it to an arbitrary planar algebra , giving the planar algebra a concatenation multiplication to match that of noncommutative polynomials .",
    "unfortunately , though the algbera structure is very straightforward , the inner product is not always easy to work with as words of different length are not orthogonal . in this paper",
    "we use a simple diagrammatic orthogonalisation discovered by the third author to reprove the ii@xmath0 factor results of @xcite in a direct and simple way without the use of full fock space or graph c@xmath1-algebras .",
    "one may capitalise on the advantages of orthogonalisation since the multiplication does not actually become much more complicated when transported to the orthogonal basis .",
    "we present the results by beginning with the orthogonal picture and giving a complete proof of the tower result .",
    "then we show that this orthogonal structure is actually isomorphic to that of @xcite .",
    "the same result was obtained simultaneously and independently by kodiyalam and sunder in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a subfactor planar algebra .",
    "let @xmath3 be the graded vector space @xmath4 equipped with the prehilbert space inner product @xmath5 making it an orthogonal direct sum and for which , within @xmath6 , @xmath7 write @xmath6 for @xmath8 when it is considered as the @xmath9-graded part of @xmath3",
    ". we will attempt to keep the pictures as uncluttered as possible by using several conventions and being as implicit as possible .",
    "shadings for instance will always be implicit and we will eliminate the outside boundary disc whenever convenient .",
    "an element @xmath10 will be represented whenever possible in a picture as : @xmath11 where the thick lines to the left and right of the box represent @xmath12 lines and the think line at the top represents @xmath13 lines . if the multiple lines have to be divided into groups the number off lines in each group will be indicated to the minimal extent necessary .",
    "the distinguished first interval in a box will always be the top left of the box .",
    "thus the inner product above of @xmath14 for elements of @xmath6 will be . in the original works on planar algebras ( e.g. @xcite ) , each @xmath15 ia an associative * -algebra whose product , with these conventions , would be to view @xmath15 as @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "there are unital inclusions of @xmath15 in @xmath18 by identifying @xmath19 with .",
    "the identity element of @xmath15 is thus represented by a single thick horizontal line .",
    "it is also the identity element of @xmath3 .",
    "the trace ( often called the markov trace ) @xmath20 on@xmath15 is normalised so as to be compatible with the inclusions by @xmath21 .",
    "we extend this trace to @xmath3 by the same formula so that the trace of an element is the markov trace of its zero - graded piece .",
    "each @xmath22 is a finite dimensional c@xmath1-algebra whose norms are also compatible with the inclusions .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are elements of @xmath3 we define their product to be @xmath25    ( where the @xmath26 means there are @xmath26 parallel strings .",
    "the numbers of other parallel strings are then implicitly defined by our conventions . )",
    "the * -structure on @xmath6 is just the involution coming from the subfactor planar algebra .",
    "@xmath27 is an associative * -algebra .",
    "the property @xmath28 is immediate from the properties of a planar * -algebra . for associativity note that both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by the sum over all epi ( see section [ basis ] ) diagrams where no strand has both of its endpoints of @xmath19 , or both of its endpoints on @xmath31 , or both of its endpoints on @xmath32 .",
    "here are two typical examples : +    the inner product @xmath14 is clearly equal to @xmath33 and is positive definite by definition .",
    "we would like to perform the gns construction but since there is no c@xmath1-algebra available we need to show by hand that left ( and hence right ) multiplication by elements of @xmath3 is bounded .",
    "let @xmath34 .",
    "then the map @xmath35 , defined by @xmath36 is bounded for the prehilbert space structure .",
    "we may suppose @xmath10 for some @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath37 is a sum of @xmath38 maps @xmath39 from an orthogonal direct sum of finite dimensional hilbert spaces to another , respecting the orthogonal decomposition,@xmath39 being the map defined by the @xmath26th .",
    "term in the sum defining @xmath40 .",
    "thus it suffices to show that the norm of the map @xmath41 is bounded independently of @xmath42 , the number of @xmath26 values being @xmath43 .",
    "clearly we may suppose that @xmath44 which simplifies the number of pictures to be considered .",
    "so if @xmath45 we must estimate @xmath46 which is the following tangle :    @xmath47    we may suppose @xmath48 since the norm of an operator is equal to that of its adjoint and the roles of @xmath26 and @xmath49 are reversed in going between @xmath39 and @xmath50 .",
    "then we may isotope the picture , putting @xmath19 and @xmath31 in boxes with the same number ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively ) of boundary points on the top and bottom , also possibly rotating them , to obtain the following equivalent tangle :    @xmath47    note that the multiplicities of all the strings are determined by the @xmath53 and our conventions .",
    "neglecting powers of @xmath54 which do not involve @xmath42 we see @xmath55 where @xmath56 is @xmath19 with @xmath57 strings to the right and @xmath58 is @xmath31 with @xmath59 strings to the left . the strings to the right do not change the norm of @xmath19 ( as an element of the finite dimensional c@xmath1-algebra @xmath60 ) by the uniqueness of the c@xmath1-norm .",
    "the ( @xmath61- ) norm of @xmath58 differs from that of @xmath31 by an @xmath42-independent power of @xmath54 .",
