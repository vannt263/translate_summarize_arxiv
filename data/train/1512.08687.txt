    "ux ursae majoris ( ux uma ) is one of the oldest and most thoroughly studied of the cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) . among non - eruptive cvs , it s probably the champion in both respects .",
    "visual and photoelectric photometry showed it to be an eclipsing binary with a remarkably short period of 4.72 hours @xcite , and @xcite proposed a model in which the hot star in the binary is surrounded by a large ring of gas on which a bright region ( hot spot ) resides .",
    "the hot spot became a key feature of the basic model for understanding cvs , in which the spot is interpreted as the region where the mass - transfer stream impacts the outer edge of the accretion disc .",
    "the spectrum of ux uma closely resembles that of dwarf novae in eruption : a blue continuum with broad , shallow hydrogen absorption lines , and narrow h emission contained within these absorption troughs . and",
    "weak emission are sometimes also present .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies have been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distance is @xmath8 pc @xcite . the out - of - eclipse mean @xmath9 magnitude is @xmath013.0 , but this is adversely affected by interstellar extinction ( @xmath00.2 mag ) and the geometrical projection of a fairly edge - on disc ( @xmath01.0 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "after these corrections , the angle - averaged @xmath10 is about @xmath11 .",
    "that s just about right for the ` high state ' of a dwarf nova with an orbital period of 4.7 hours ( fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus the spectrum and brightness are consistent with interpretation as a dwarf nova in the high state .",
    "in addition , ux uma shows another phenomenon which is highly characteristic of dwarf novae : very rapid ( @xmath030 s ) oscillations in its optical and uv brightness @xcite .",
    "these oscillations are seen in practically every dwarf nova near the peak of eruption , and are consequently called ` dwarf nova oscillations ' ( dnos ; @xcite , especially the abstract and fig .",
    "their presence in ux uma is yet another reason why the star is commonly regarded , and described , as essentially a ` permanently erupting dwarf nova ' .",
    "ux uma vaulted to the world s attention from a program of time - series photometry in the 1940s .",
    "we launched a more intensive program in 2015 , and discovered several additional periodic signals , which we describe in this paper and interpret as signifying the retrograde precession of the accretion disc .",
    "we conducted this campaign with our global network of small photometric telescopes , the center for backyard astrophysics ( cba ) .",
    "the network s general approach to instrumentation and observing methods is given by @xcite , and the summary observing log is given in table  [ obs - log ] .",
    "we used differential photometry with respect to one of the nearby field stars gsc 3469 - 0356 ( @xmath12 ) , gsc 3469 - 0290 ( @xmath13 ) , and gsc 3469 - 0867 ( @xmath14 ) , with magnitudes corresponding to the apass photometric survey @xcite .",
    "we constructed light curves using overlaps of the various time series to calibrate each on a common instrumental scale . that scale is roughly a @xmath9 magnitude since most of our data is unfiltered in order to improve signal - to - noise",
    "nevertheless , we did obtain sufficient data with a true @xmath9 filter to measure offsets , and this allowed us to place all our data into a magnitude scale that is expected to nearly correspond to a true @xmath9 , with a zero - point uncertainty of @xmath00.04 mag .    the cycle time",
    "( integration + readout ) between points in the various time series was usually near @xmath060 seconds .",
    "we made no correction for differential ( color ) extinction , although such a correction is in principle necessary , since all cvs are bluer than field stars .",
    "but in a long time series , such effects are always confined to the same frequencies ( very near 1 and 2 cycles per sidereal day ) , so the resultant corruption is easily identified and ignored . in the present case , it is also mitigated by the northern latitudes of observers and the far - northern declination of the star ( 51 degrees ) , which made it possible to obtain long runs within our self - imposed limit of 2.0 airmasses . finally , we just prefer to keep human hands off the data as much as possible .    as detailed in table  [ obs - log ]",
    ", the campaign amounted to 355 separate time series on 121 nights distributed over a span of 153 nights from february 24 to july 26 , 2015 .",
    "the total coverage was 1785 hours , all from sites in europe and north america .",
    "this longitude span permitted many @xmath014 hour runs , which eliminated all possibility of daily aliases  the usual bugaboo of single - longitude time series .    .",
    "log of observations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > \" , ]     the departures from a smooth curve are quite large  up to 45 min  whereas we estimate a typical measurement error of 10 - 15 min .",
    "but the dispersion in timings on individual nights is much smaller , so we suspected that some other effect contributes to that variance .",
    "the power spectrum of the residuals about the quadratic fit shows a peak at 0.273(2 ) c d@xmath15 , which indicates that the precession term is responsible for this effect , even though its direct photometric signature  the 3.68 d signal  has been accurately subtracted .",
    "most cataclysmic variables show a periodic signal at @xmath16 , either from an eclipse  pretty obvious !  or from some other effect of high or moderate inclination , e.g. the periodic obscuration of the mass - transfer ` hot spot ' as it wheels around the disc .",
    "many ( @xmath0200 ) also show a photometric period a few percent longer than @xmath16 ( positive superhumps ) .",
    "most of the latter are short - period dwarf novae , which sprout these signals for 14 weeks , during their long outbursts ( ` supermaxima ' ) .",
    "this is now understood as arising from the apsidal precession of the accretion disc , rendered eccentric at the 3:1 resonance in the disc .",
    "a few stars which are not dwarf novae also show this effect , but these are all short - period ( @xmath17 h ) nova - like variables , which in many ways can be seen as permanently erupting dwarf novae .",
    "these signals are known as ` permanent ' superhumps @xcite .    only a disc large enough to reach the 3:1 resonance can suffer this instability @xcite , and that is presumably the reason that positive superhumps are only found in short - period stars .",
    "but some stars show photometric signals with @xmath18  the negative superhumpers .",
    "much less is known about them .",
    "the early papers on these phenomena @xcite postulated the existence of a tilted accretion disc , which is forced to precess slowly backwards ( relative to the orbit ) by the torque from the secondary .",
    "the angular relation between the secondary ( including its structures , viz .",
    "the mass - transfer stream ) and the disc then repeats with a period slightly less than @xmath16 .",
    "this is a negative superhump .",
    "roughly 20 cvs show negative superhumps ( see table  2 of @xcite ) , and roughly half of these ( see table  5 of @xcite ) also show a photometric signal at the postulated precession period .",
    "detection of that low - frequency signal is a strong point in support of the theory , since a wobbling disc should present an effective area which varies with the wobble period .",
    "our data demonstrate that ux uma joins this club .",
    "we hypothesize that its accretion disc wobbles about the orbital plane with a period @xmath19 d , and we see its effective area varying on that period . but",
    "the orbiting secondary  not in the inertial frame !  sees the disc with a slightly shorter recurrence period , such that @xmath20 c d@xmath15 , or @xmath21 d. the effect is basically identical to the famous tropical / sidereal year effect in the earth - sun system , or the draconic / sidereal month effect in the earth - moon system .",
    "@xcite discusses this analogy in great , and fascinating , detail .",
    "the cause and maintenance of disc tilt is not known .",
    "no actual dwarf nova in outburst shows negative superhumps , although their closest cousins  nova - like variables with @xmath22 h  frequently do @xcite .",
    "it s possible that the 3:1 resonance is again involved , but with the tilt instability growing so slowly that only a ` permanent ' dwarf nova , which is in a high - viscosity state for a long time , can develop sufficient tilt .",
    "an alternative theory is the recent work by @xcite , which invokes white - dwarf magnetism to break the azimuthal symmetry and permit  in fact , create  disc tilt .",
    "they make an impressive case ; and such an origin would be especially intriguing because ux uma also shows the very - high - frequency dnos ( signatures of white - dwarf rotation ? ) , which have remained equally mysterious .",
    "ux uma is not a typical member of this club .",
    "most members belong to the sw sex subclass , which have shorter @xmath16 ( 3 - 4 h ) , occasional excursions to very low states , and only the @xmath23 feature ( lacking @xmath7 , and emphatically lacking @xmath24 )",
    ". they also commonly show periodic radial - velocity signals of high amplitude , presumably indicative of the mass - transfer stream overflowing the disc ( because of the tilt ) .",
    "maybe cv zoology needs to be adjusted somewhat , in order to fit these oddities .    finally , why did we find all these new effects in a star which has been closely studied for 60 years ? did they first arise in 2015 ?",
    "it seems unlikely .",
    "inspection of early light curves @xcite reveals that both the mean brightness and eclipse depths are not constant ( see , for instance , table 1 in @xcite ) , with variations within the range we have observed in 2015 .",
    "also , @xcite have reported differences of up to 50 per cent in brightness in _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations of ux uma carried out 3 months apart in 1994 .",
    "they infer that a substantial ( @xmath25 per cent ) variation of the mass transfer rate must have occurred , but a precessing disc during the 1994 _ hst _ observations would also account for the observed brightness variations .",
    "we therefore believe that the mean brightness and eclipse depths were not exceptional in 2015 .",
    "we selected the star for observation partly because previously published light curves showed variations in the orbital waveform  suggesting that a signal at some nearby frequency might be present . but to actually reveal these effects , an extensive campaign is required , and no such campaign has ever been reported .",
    "so it s a decent bet , though by no means sure , that these superhump effects have been lurking , unsuspected , in many previous observations of ux uma .",
    "1 .   we report a long photometric campaign during 2015 , with coverage on 121 of 150 nights , totalling @xmath0 1800 h. the star displayed a sinusoidal signal with a semi - amplitude of 0.22 mag and a mean period of 3.680(7 ) d , or a frequency 0.2717(5 ) c d@xmath15 .",
    "we identify the latter as @xmath7 , the accretion disc s ( putative ) frequency of retrograde nodal precession .",
    "2 .   fig .",
    "[ lcs-2nights ] shows that the orbital waveform is highly variable from day to day , but not from orbit to orbit .",
    "power - spectrum analysis shows that this arises from signals non - commensurate with @xmath16 , namely ` negative superhumps ' with frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "3 .   the mean orbital light curve  shown in fig .",
    "[ lc - orb ] and summed over more than 200 orbits ",
    "shows a wave with maximum light around orbital phase 0.35 .",
    "this is roughly 180@xmath27 out of phase with the hot - spot effect seen in u gem , which defines the standard accretion geometry for cvs .",
    "the 3.68 d period is strongly manifest in essentially every quantity we studied .",
    "the eclipse times wobble on this period with an amplitude of 33.3(9 ) s , probably because the disc s ( projected ) centre of light moves with that period .",
    "the superhump times also wobble with that period , as do the eclipse depths .",
    "[ oc - nodal ] shows that the precession period varied smoothly , decreasing by @xmath00.2 d over the 5-month campaign . as it did , the superhump period changed accordingly , maintaining @xmath28 . 6 .",
    "about a dozen other cvs show this basic triad of frequencies ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath4 ) .",
    "most are so - called sw sex stars .",
    "because the physics which underlies this category is probably the wobbling non - coplanar disc , it is likely that the credentialing scheme of that club @xcite will have to change , in order to accommodate ux uma .",
    "we note that @xcite has also , based on spectroscopic evidence , proposed that ux uma has transient episodes of sw sex behaviour .",
    "we thank the national science foundation for support of this research ( ast12 - 11129 ) , and also the mount cuba astronomical foundation .",
    "finally , we thank the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) for providing the infrastructure and continued inspiration which makes programs like this possible ."
