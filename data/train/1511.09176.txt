    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite is a great success of the particle physics standard model(sm ) . meanwhile , there should be some new physics(np ) beyond the sm in order to explain experimental observations such as neutrino oscillation , dark matter required by cosmology and astronomy and the theoretically unnaturalness of sm .",
    "lots of new physics models have been proposed , but no direct evidence for them has been found at the lhc .",
    "current experimental data indicate that the energy scale of new physics @xmath7 can be higher than several tev , and new particles would possibly be too heavy to be directly observed at the lhc . as a result , measuring the indirect effects of these models at low energy scales becomes an important way to detect the new physics .",
    "the effective lagrangian has long been an important , model - independent approach for studying the indirect effects of np . after integrating out heavy degrees of freedom above the cutoff scale @xmath8",
    ", the leading effects at low energies can be parameterized by the effective interactions between the standard model fields .",
    "the coefficients of these interactions , called `` anomalous couplings '' , reflect the strength of the new physics effects at low energies .",
    "many new physics models aim to relieve the fine - tuning problem caused by the sm higgs sector .",
    "these models change the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) higgs mechanism and cause the anomalous gauge couplings ( agcs ) and anomalous higgs couplings .",
    "so agcs and anomalous higgs couplings have been well studied .",
    "there have been amounts of theoretical studies on agcs @xcite and experimental measurements at the lep@xcite , the tevatron@xcite and the lhc@xcite , and anomalous higgs couplings are also well studied before@xcite and after@xcite the higgs discovery . on the other hand",
    ", many new physics models also proposed new gauge interactions or extra fermions .",
    "these new sectors would change the couplings between sm fermions and electroweak ( ew ) gauge bosons directly or indirectly .",
    "different models or model parameters can bring different fermion anomalous couplings deviated from the sm .",
    "there are some model - dependent studies on fermion anomalous couplings , most of them are about top anomalous couplings , like @xmath9 type@xcite and @xmath10 type@xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian gives the effective interactions between fermions and electroweak gauge bosons , and measuring these fermion anomalous electroweak couplings is a model - independent method for studying new physics . in our previous paper",
    ", we studied how to measure the lepton anomalous electroweak couplings via the @xmath11 process at electron - positron colliders such as the lep and the ilc@xcite .",
    "similarly there are also quark anomalous electroweak couplings in the effective lagrangian .",
    "we concentrate on how to measure the quark anomalous electroweak couplings via the @xmath0 process at the lhc in the present paper .",
    "although the accuracies at hadron colliders are worse than the ilc , the collision energies is much higher .",
    "the anomalous couplings will result in higher energy power dependence , hence the high energy @xmath12-pair production at the lhc can still give sensitive detection limits on the anomalous couplings .",
    "we also expand the study to @xmath13 processes at the lhc .",
    "we analyze their measurement capability on quark anomalous electroweak couplings and find that the new processes provide a good complement to the @xmath0 process .",
    "they are sensitive to those anomalous couplings which are independent to the @xmath0 process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : el ] we give the corresponding dimension-6 operators in the effective lagrangian . in sec.[sec : ppwwlhc ] we study the @xmath0 process at the 8 tev and 14 tev lhc in details .",
    "the anomalous couplings will deviate the cross section of @xmath12-pair production , and conversely the uncertainty of experimental measurement at the lhc can give constraints on the anomalous couplings . after taking the relative uncertainty of cross section measurement as @xmath14 at the lhc , the conservative detection limits on the quark anomalous ew couplings are derived .",
    "we also introduce some additional kinematic cuts to improve the sensitivities . in sec.[sec : chi2 ] we briefly study the kinematic differences between different anomalous couplings and discuss the potential of the @xmath6-analysis to distinguish them . in sec.[sec : comp ] @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 processes at the 14 tev lhc are taken as complementarities . in sec.[sec:100tev ] we discuss the detection ability of anomalous couplings at a possible future 100 tev proton - proton collider(sppc ) . in sec.[sec :",
    "summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "assuming that there is a fundamental new physics theory above some certain energy scale @xmath8 , the effective field theory ( eft ) is customary to formulate new physics effects at energies well below @xmath8 .",
    "after integrating out heavy degrees of freedom above @xmath8 , the leading effects at low energies can be parameterized by the effective interaction terms that are constructed with the sm fields . in the linearly realizing eft@xcite ,",
    "the gauge - invariant high dimensional effective interaction terms are organized in powers of @xmath17 .",
    "the effective interaction terms are called effective operators , and their coefficients are called anomalous couplings which reflect the strength of the new physics effects at low energies .    in this paper , we study the quark anomalous ew interactions , so we investigate all the gauge - invariant effective operators that contain quark fields and ew gauge fields . in order to keep the overall dimension consistent in the lagrangian ,",
    "any dimension - i effective operator , @xmath18 , is suppressed by @xmath19 , where @xmath8 is the scale of the uv - complete theory .",
    "low energy effects introduced by higher order operators are strongly suppressed , so we only study the leading order dimension-6 effective operators .",
    "we know that cp is not strictly conserved in the sm , and there are cp - odd effective operators in eft as well .",
    "but the cp - odd operators suffer severe experimental constraints , so they are not our concern in this paper .",
    "we follow the literature@xcite to construct all these cp - even dimension-6 @xmath20 gauge invariant operators .",
    "they are    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the left - handed quark doublet , and @xmath23(@xmath24 ) is the right - handed up - type(down - type ) quark singlet .",
    "@xmath25/ @xmath26 are @xmath27 / @xmath28 gauge fields .",
    "the feynman rules of corresponding anomalous vertices between mass eigenstates after ew symmetry breaking are listed in the appendix . and",
    "the effective lagrangian can be written as    @xmath30    there are always several anomalous couplings affecting one given process .",
    "but if the anomalous couplings are small , the deviations from the sm squared amplitudes mainly come from interferences between the sm and anomalous couplings .",
    "the interferences between anomalous couplings are negligible , which means that total deviations caused by multi - anomalous couplings is simply the sum of deviations by each coupling .",
    "so in this paper we only give results of the single - parameter analysis , as others usually do .",
    "the @xmath0 process is a good testing process because it contains almost all information of quark ew couplings .",
    "the shortage is that it is not associated with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 due to the momentum structures of their vertices , just like the case of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the @xmath36 process of our previous paper .",
    "we take the pure leptonic @xmath12 decay and the final states are @xmath37 at hadron colliders , where @xmath38 stands for @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "the final states show up as two opposite - charged leptons with some missing energy on the detectors of the lhc .",
    "our first step is to calculate the cross - sections with different anomalous couplings , and derive sensitivity bounds for the anomalous couplings by certain relative deviations from sm predictions .",
    "we only calculate the effects of anomalous couplings at tree level , so loop calculations are beyond our study . in order to simulate detectors ,",
    "we apply the acceptation basic cuts of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 on final leptons . considering that the two opposite - charged leptons may come from a drell - yan process or z - decay",
    ", we require @xmath44 and impose a z - mass veto as @xmath45 if the two final leptons are same - flavor .",
    "after these basic kinematic cuts the remaining cross - section is @xmath46 for the 8(14 ) tev lhc .",
    "now we apply the single - parameter analysis , i.e.varying the value of one coupling while keeping others zero .",
    "figure [ fig:8tev - basic ] and figure [ fig:14tev - basic ] show the relative deviations on cross section caused by different anomalous couplings at the 8 tev and 14 tev lhc . @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 affect the t - channel diagram and contribute to the anomalous @xmath49 vertex so they are different from @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "if the experiments at the lhc do not find any obvious deviations from the sm cross section , they can give upper bounds on these anomalous couplings .",
    "in our previous paper , we proposed a relative uncertainty as 5% for the @xmath12 pair production cross section at the lep and the ilc .",
    "the systematic uncertainties at hadron colliders are larger than electron - positron colliders . in the recent cms report(the first paper in @xcite )",
    ", the measured @xmath53 cross section is @xmath54 pb . the relative uncertainty is about 8% . as we did in our previous paper",
    ", we enlarge the uncertainty and conversely propose that the lhc experiments can claim anomalous effects when @xmath55 .",
    "this uncertainty gives conservative detection limits on @xmath56 , and one may have his own uncertainty and derive corresponding detection limits from figure [ fig:8tev - basic ] and figure [ fig:14tev - basic ] .",
    "for the 8 tev lhc our limits are    @xmath57    and for the 14 tev lhc the results are    @xmath58    apart from the w - pair production , their decays are also affected by anomalous couplings .",
    "but previous measurements tell us that the deviations in the w decay branching fractions from the sm should be less than 2% .",
    "it is a quite small change compared to 20% deviation in productions , so here we do not take that into consideration .",
    "in fact , the measurements of w / z decay width and branching ratios have high accuracies , and they can also provide constraints on anomalous couplings .",
    "we performed analytical analysis of the anomalous leptonic partial width in our previous paper@xcite , and there is no difference for w / z s hadronic decay .",
    "the main difference between anomalous and sm ew vertices is that the anomalous vertices depend on momentums while the couplings are constants in the sm .",
    "it means that the anomalous part becomes more significant when particles carry larger momentum . as we can see from figure",
    "[ fig:8tev - basic ] and [ fig:14tev - basic ] , the 14 tev lhc has better anomalous - coupling sensitivities than the 8 tev lhc .",
    "we have used this property to illustrate that the ilc has advantages over the lep in our previous paper . on the other hand ,",
    "when we study @xmath59 collision we should use parton distribution function ( pdf ) , which means that in a proton - proton collider with certain energy the actual processes have different @xmath60 .",
    "we know from above discussions that processes with higher @xmath60 tend to be more sensitive to anomalous couplings , so we can improve the sensitivities not only by lifting the collider energy , but also by introducing some kinematic cuts to remove the low - energy parts .    of course , we can not freely introduce cuts without restriction .",
    "we must keep enough number of events for statistic analysis , i.e. make sure that the remaining cross section is above some certain value to really observe deviations if they exist . for @xmath61 significance",
    "we have    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the integral luminosity .",
    "we require @xmath64 .",
    "taking @xmath65 , we have the needed cross section @xmath66 .",
    "run i of the lhc at 7 tev and 8 tev has about @xmath67 , and run ii at 13 tev and 14 tev should reach at least @xmath68 , so the remaining cross section should be no less than several fb .",
    "we choose the invariant mass of two final leptons @xmath69 as a kinematic parameter to identify the collision energy .",
    "to clearly show the differences in @xmath69 distributions between sm and anomalous cases , we specify particular @xmath56 values to make @xmath70 , and draw the distributions in figure [ fig:8tev - dis - mll ] and figure [ fig:14tev - dis - mll ] .",
    "distribution of the cross section at the 8 tev lhc .",

    "there have been plenty of studies on anomalous couplings , and their detections or constraints at different colliders .",
    "all these studies are mainly based on single - parameter analysis , and one may wonder whether we can tell which anomalous coupling causes the deviation if any signal arises .",
    "the single - parameter analysis is just an idealized approach , as all effective operators combine to give the actual result of a typical process . to find out the origin of any anomalous signal",
    ", we may choose one specific process(or kinematic variable ) which is most sensitive to one anomalous coupling(or a particular combination of the couplings ) while insensitive to the others .",
    "then this process , or kinematic variable , will be a good probe for the selected anomalous coupling .",
    "it is easy to figure out whether a given process is a good probe for some anomalous coupling .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 process is most sensitive to @xmath47 compared to the other four , so it is a good probe for @xmath47 . to quantitatively illustrate the validity of some kinematic variable as a probe",
