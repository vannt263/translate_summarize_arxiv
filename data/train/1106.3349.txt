    "unlike gcp , a graph admiting a @xmath0-eqcol may not admit a @xmath10-eqcol .",
    "this leads us to define @xmath11 as the set of @xmath12 such that @xmath6 does not admit any @xmath0-eqcol .",

    "the cutting process consists in looking for violated clique and @xmath41 - 2-rank inequalities with a greedy algorithm . during the separation of clique inequalities , it attempts to find violated @xmath96-clique - neighborhood inequalities by scanning vertices @xmath75 not adjacent to a given clique @xmath31 .",

    "separation routines for clique and block inequalities are exposed in @xcite .",
    "the b&c algorithm also includes an initial heuristic , a primal heuristic and a custom branching rule .",
