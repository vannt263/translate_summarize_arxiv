    "in contrast with the usual leptogenesis scenario of standard cosmology , where low - energy neutrino data favors a strong washout regime and quasi - degenerate light neutrinos are not compatible with leptogenesis , we have found that in the high - energy regime of braneworld cosmology leptogenesis can be successfully realized in a weak washout regime , and a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum is allowed .    for an initially vanishing heavy majorana neutrino abundance",
    ", we have obtained bounds on the decaying heavy majorana neutrino mass , the fundamental five - dimensional gravity scale and the transition temperature from brane to standard cosmology .",
    "as far as the upper bound on the light neutrino masses is concerned , we have seen that thermal leptogenesis in the brane imposes a limit less restrictive than @xmath163  ev , which is the one presently implied by wmap results .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that all the bounds have been derived under the simple assumption of hierarchical heavy majorana neutrinos . for a partially degenerate spectrum",
    "these bounds can be relaxed . indeed ,",
    "if at least two of the heavy majorana neutrinos are quasi - degenerate in mass , i.e. @xmath164 , then the leptonic @xmath6 asymmetry relevant for leptogenesis exhibits the resonant behavior @xmath165  @xcite , and values of @xmath166 can be reached . in this case , the lower bound on @xmath109 coming from leptogenesis can be relaxed  @xcite .",
    "let us also briefly comment on the consistency of inflation and reheating with the present framework of thermal leptogenesis .",
    "assuming that inflation is driven by a simple quadratic chaotic inflation potential , @xmath167 , the scale of inflation in the @xmath168-dominated period is roughly given by @xmath169  @xcite , thus ensuring that sufficient inflation can take place while fulfilling the requirement @xmath170 .",
    "another important constraint comes from the reheating process , often associated with the decay of the inflaton into elementary particles , and which eventually results in the creation of a thermal bath .",
    "if the inflaton decays through yukawa interactions with a coupling to matter fields of order @xmath171 , then the decay rate is fast , @xmath172 , and reheating is practically instantaneous . assuming that inflation ends in the @xmath168-regime , the reheating temperature is estimated as @xmath173 , so that the energy density of radiation @xmath174 . since consistency with braneworld thermal leptogenesis requires @xmath175 , from eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) one obtains the upper bound @xmath176  gev , which coincides with the leptogenesis bound implied by the observed baryon asymmetry ( cf . fig .  3 ) .",
    "notice however that , for values of @xmath16 close to the upper limit , i.e. @xmath177  gev , one would have @xmath178  gev and the mechanism of leptogenesis would occur during the transition from brane to standard cosmology .    during the reheating process",
    "the distribution of particles is far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , number - conserving as well as number - violating interactions are necessary to achieve kinetic and chemical equilibrium among the different species . in an expanding universe ,",
    "full thermal equilibrium requires a sufficiently low temperature .",
    "indeed , @xmath179 gut interactions mediated by massless gauge bosons would have occurred in the very early universe at a rate @xmath180 , with @xmath181 . since during the radiation - dominated era of standard cosmology @xmath182",
    ", such interactions are expected to be in equilibrium for @xmath183  gev  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the high - energy regime of braneworld cosmology the expansion rate scales as @xmath184 and , consequently , thermal equilibrium is expected at @xmath185  gev for @xmath176  gev .",
    "clearly , the above analysis could be subject to modifications , if there exist new interactions which could thermalize the universe at the earliest epochs .",
    "for instance , it is conceivable that quantum gravity effects near the fundamental planck scale could have resulted in a state of maximal entropy .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of a complete theory of quantum gravity , this remains an open issue .",

    "<S> the mechanism of thermal leptogenesis is investigated in the high - energy regime of braneworld cosmology . within the simplest seesaw framework with hierarchical heavy majorana neutrinos , we study the implications of the modified friedmann equation on the realization of this mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the usual leptogenesis scenario of standard cosmology , where low - energy neutrino data favors a mildly strong washout regime , we find that leptogenesis in the braneworld regime is successfully realized in a weak washout regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a quasi - degenerate light neutrino mass spectrum is found to be compatible with this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> for an initially vanishing heavy majorana neutrino abundance , thermal leptogenesis in the brane requires the decaying heavy majorana neutrino mass to be @xmath0  gev and the fundamental five - dimensional gravity scale @xmath1  gev , which corresponds to a transition from brane to standard cosmology at temperatures @xmath2  gev . </S>"
