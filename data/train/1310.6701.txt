    "the discovery of the long - range rapidity correlation known as the ridge in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite spurred , among other things , a flurry of activity @xcite aimed at better understanding two - particle correlations in the parton saturation / color glass condensate ( cgc ) physics framework ( see @xcite for reviews of the saturation / cgc field ) .",
    "apart from quantifying how much of the ridge dynamics , which in the meantime was also observed by experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in proton  proton ( @xmath1 ) and proton  nucleus ( @xmath2 ) collisions @xcite , is due to the initial - state saturation effects , the problem of two - gluon production in nucleus  nucleus ( @xmath3 ) collisions is an important theoretical problem in its own right , allowing us to gain a new insight in the nonlinear dynamics of strong gluon fields in the initial stages of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the strategy for tackling the two - gluon production problem closely parallels that of the single - gluon production .",
    "any observable in the saturation / cgc framework is calculated in three stages : ( i ) first the observable is evaluated in the quasi - classical glauber  mueller ( gm ) @xcite / mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) @xcite approximation ; ( ii ) then the small-@xmath4 balitsky  kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite and jalilian - marian  iancu  mclerran  weigert  leonidov  kovner ( jimwlk ) @xcite nonlinear evolution corrections are included into the expression ; ( iii ) finally , phenomenological applications @xcite demand that the scale of the running coupling is fixed @xcite using , e.g. , brodsky  lepage  mackenzie ( blm ) prescription @xcite .",
    "indeed higher - order perturbative corrections ( beyond the running coupling corrections ) need to be included as well @xcite , though at this point they have not been implemented in the existing phenomenology .",
    "while the steps ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) have been fully implemented for the total cross section in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and for the corresponding structure functions , the situation is more complicated for particle production .",
    "the classical gluon production cross section ( step ( i ) in the above classification ) is known analytically in @xmath1 collisions ( dilute  dilute scattering ) @xcite and in @xmath2 collisions ( dilute  dense scattering ) @xcite , while only numerical solution @xcite exists for the classical gluon field in @xmath3 collisions ( dense  dense scattering ) .",
    "leading-@xmath5 evolution corrections ( step ( ii ) ) have been included into the @xmath2 gluon production cross section in @xcite .",
    "( the analogous @xmath1 result can be obtained from @xmath2 by expansion to the lowest order in saturation effects in the nucleus . ) running coupling corrections for the gluon production ( step ( i ) ) have only been resummed for the @xmath1 case @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the two - gluon production in the saturation / cgc framework is somewhat less developed , chiefly due to the complexity of the problem .",
    "the problem of two - gluon production in dis and @xmath2 ( dilute  dense ) collisions was solved in @xcite for the gluons produced with the large separation in rapidity , @xmath6 with @xmath7 the strong coupling constant . to describe two - gluon production in @xmath3 collisions",
    "one needs to include higher - order density effects in the projectile .",
    "the lowest - order quasi - classical two - gluon production cross section in @xmath3 was derived in the original paper @xcite , with the gluons close to each other in rapidity , @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding two - gluon production cross section for the semi - dilute  dense scattering case ( which we will refer to as heavy - light ion collisions ) was found only recently in @xcite .",
    "( note that the @xmath2 scattering is not a good model for two - gluon production in dense ",
    "dense collisions in the cgc framework , since in @xmath3 collisions the two gluons are produced mainly from different nucleons : replacing one of the nuclei by a proton would force two gluons to be emitted off of the same proton , which is subleading in the @xmath3 case . here",
    "we model @xmath3 collisions by considering the case when one nucleus is much smaller than another one , while still having a significant number of nucleons @xcite : these are the heavy - light ion collisions . )",
    "since the cross section in @xcite expresses the interaction with the dense target nucleus via wilson lines , small-@xmath4 evolution between the produced gluons and the target can be automatically included into it : however , unlike the @xmath2 case of @xcite , no one has yet included the evolution between the projectile and the produced gluons in heavy - light ion collisions , allowing the gluons to be produced at mid - rapidity in rhic or lhc kinematics .",
    "two - gluon production in the dense  dense ( @xmath3 ) case has so far been tackled only numerically @xcite in the quasi - classical limit .",
    "all the above - mentioned results for two - gluon production @xcite indicate that the corresponding cross section exhibits long - range rapidity correlations , along with enhancement of correlations at the azimuthal opening angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 between the gluons . a saturation - inspired generalization of the lowest - order result @xcite allowed for successful @xmath1 and @xmath2 phenomenology @xcite . however , further theoretical advances are needed to improve the precision of cgc predictions for di - hadron correlations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the properties of the two - gluon production cross section in heavy - light ion collisions found in @xcite . while we begin the paper by reviewing the main results of @xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec - recap ] , our paper is best read in conjunction with @xcite .",
    "the scope of our paper covers a wide range of issues in our understanding of two - gluon correlations .",
    "recently there was a significant amount of discussion in the community of whether the ridge correlations seen in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions at the lhc @xcite have hydrodynamic or cgc origin @xcite .",
    "it appears important to find an experiment being able to disentangle the two mechanism generating azimuthal correlations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geo ] we show that such an experiment could be the study of long - range rapidity correlations in the @xmath11 collisions .",
    "we show that the cgc correlations are stronger in the tip - on - tip @xmath11 collisions than in the side - on - side ones .",
    "such behavior is the exact opposite of the ellipticity - driven hydrodynamic correlations @xcite .",
    "perhaps the two effects could be disentangled by studying the @xmath11 collisions data .",
    "it has been known since the original calculation of @xcite that the two - gluon production cross section in cgc contains power - law infrared ( ir ) divergences , even for fixed momenta of the produced gluons ( see below ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the single - gluon production cross section , which only contains weak logarithmic ir divergences .",
    "the authors of @xcite conjectured that saturation effects in both colliding nuclei , when included , would regulate this divergence : this assumption appears to be confirmed by numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "the analytical expression for two - gluon production in heavy - light ion collisions obtained in @xcite contains all - order saturation effects in one of the nuclei ( the target nucleus ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : irsafe ] we study the result of @xcite to explore whether the saturation effects in one of the nuclei are sufficient to regulate the power - law ir divergence of @xcite .",
    "we find that , while some of the power - law ir divergent terms are regulated by saturation effects in the target , other terms with the same divergence remain , rendering the whole cross - section power - law ir - divergent ( see below ) .",
    "such result is indeed worrisome , since it questions our ability to make controlled phenomenological predictions for di - hadron correlations : however we find that the ir - divergent piece does not contain any azimuthally - nontrivial correlations .",
    "hence the @xmath12-dependent part of the correlations is not affected and is safe from this ir divergence",
    ".    the cross section for single - gluon production in @xmath2 collisions calculated in approximations ( i ) and ( ii ) described above can be cast in a @xmath0-factorized form @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath0-factorization at the jimwlk functional level has been proven ( in the leading-@xmath5 approximation ) for local in rapidity particle production in dense ",
    "dense collisions in @xcite .",
    "motivated by these results we try obtaining a @xmath0-factorized form for two - gluon production cross section in sec .  [",
    "sec : fact ] . the final result , given in , is a @xmath0-factorized expression , whose form is more complicated than that for the single - gluon production @xcite .",
    "the expression contains not only a convolution over transverse momenta , but also over impact parameters .",
    "the objects being convoluted are not the unintegrated gluon distributions , but rather one- and two - gluon wigner distributions , containing the information about both the gluons momenta and impact parameters .",
    "note that the production cross section employs two types of two - gluon wigner distributions : double - trace and quadrupole ones , introduced for the first time in this paper .",
    "( this is to be compared with the dipole single - gluon distribution entering the single - gluon production @xcite . )",
    "another important question concerning the energy - dependence of the two - gluon production cross section is studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : energy ] .",
    "we find that , in the leading power - of - energy approximation , the two - gluon correlation function in heavy - light ion collisions is independent of the center - of - mass energy of the collision .",
    "this is a prediction which can be verified experimentally .",
    "note that , as we have mentioned above , the two - gluon production cross section of @xcite was derived without any evolution corrections between the projectile and the produced gluons .",
    "hence , in this approximation , the net rapidity interval is equal to the rapidity interval between the produced gluons and the target .",
    "further studies of energy and rapidity dependence of two - gluon production should be carried out improving upon our approximation .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] by summarizing our main results and discussing future avenues of research on correlations in the cgc framework .",
    "in @xcite we considered two - gluon production in a collision of a large heavy ion ( target ) with a lighter nucleus ( projectile ) .",
    "the projectile was considered to be smaller than the target , but still large enough a nucleus for the two gluons to be produced in collisions of different nucleons in the projectile with the target nucleus .",
    "formally we assume that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the atomic numbers of the projectile and the target .",
    "the target was large enough for the saturation effects to be important , such that @xmath16 .",
    "the saturation effects in the projectile were kept at the lowest order with @xmath17 . in terms of momentum scales the regime of interest is @xmath18 , with @xmath0 the transverse momentum of either one of the produced gluons ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 the saturation scale of the projectile which is much smaller than the saturation scale of the target , @xmath22 .",
    "the approximation used in @xcite corresponds to calculating the two - gluon production in nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath23 ) collisions in the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model @xcite while keeping interactions with the projectile nucleus to the lowest non - trivial order of two interacting nucleons .",
    "this setup may not directly describe the bulk of proton - nucleus ( @xmath24 ) collisions ( also known as the dense - dilute collisions ) ; note however that if one triggers on the high - multiplicity @xmath24 events one is then probing rare high - parton - number fluctuations in the proton wave function , which make the parton density in the proton appear more like that in a small nucleus .",
    "hence our setup may be relevant for high - multiplicity @xmath24 collisions as well .",

    "this form does not contain the information needed to , say , calculate the correlation function , since for that one needs terms that are subleading in the large-@xmath30 limit .",
    "another interesting property is that we can isolate the part of the cross - section that gives rise to hbt correlations @xcite . due to the nature of hbt correlations ,",
    "the only way the correlations can be generated is through interference effects .",
    "thus only the crossed diagrams contribute .",
    "in addition , for the correlation to be pure hbt , the two produced gluons should have the same colors ( to be identical particles ) : imposing same - color requirement on the crossed diagrams is equivalent to the projection employed in arriving at .",
    "we conclude that the only part of the quadrupole two - gluon distribution function that contributes to hbt correlations is the portion that can be factorized into two single - gluon distributions shown in . with the help of the hbt part of the two - gluon production cross - section",

    "as mentioned before , we are working in the regime where the rapidities of the produced gluons , @xmath67 , are sufficiently close to the rapidity of the projectile @xmath43 such that no small-@xmath4 evolution needs to be included in the @xmath293 $ ] and @xmath294 $ ] rapidity intervals ( for @xmath295 ) .",

    "the validity of the gaussian truncation for higher - order correlators of wilson lines was studied numerically in @xcite , while analytic arguments in support of the gaussian approximation have been proposed in @xcite .    here",
    "we will assume that the gaussian truncation is valid , and apply it to determine the energy dependence of the two - gluon production cross section . while the exact analytic solution of the bk equation is not known , a good approximation exists immediately outside the saturation region @xcite @xmath306^{1 + 2 i \\ ; \\nu_0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ( imaginary part of the ) dipole forward scattering amplitude is @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",

    "this is by no means a proof of factorization for two - gluon production : rather this simply is an observation that two - gluon production cross section , calculated in the approximation used above , can be written in this factorized form",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether this ( or any other ) factorized form would survive the inclusion of small-@xmath4 evolution correction in the interval between the semi - dilute projectile and the produced gluons .",
    "this is left for the future work .",
    "we have also shown that the part of the two - gluon production cross section given by contains a power - law ir divergence , as shown in , despite all the target wave function saturation effects included in the expression .",
    "luckily the azimuthal - angle dependence of the corresponding correlator is not affected by this divergence .",

    "<S> we study the properties of the cross section for two - gluon production in heavy - light ion collisions derived in our previous paper @xcite in the saturation / color glass condensate framework . concentrating on the energy and geometry dependence of the corresponding correlation functions we find that the two - gluon correlator is a much slower function of the center - of - mass energy than the one- and two - gluon production cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry dependence of the correlation function leads to stronger azimuthal near- and away - side correlations in the tip - on - tip u+u collisions than in the side - on - side u+u collisions , an exactly opposite behavior from the correlations generated by the elliptic flow of the quark - gluon plasma : a study of azimuthal correlations in the u+u collisions may thus help to disentangle the two sources of correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the cross section for two - gluon production in heavy - light ion collisions contains a power - law infrared ( ir ) divergence even for fixed produced gluon momenta : while saturation effects in the target regulate some of the power - law ir divergent terms in the lowest - order expression for the two - gluon correlator , other power - law ir divergent terms remain , possibly due to absence of saturation effects in the dilute projectile . </S>",
    "<S> finally we rewrite our result for the two - gluon production cross - section in a @xmath0-factorized form , obtaining a new factorized expression involving a convolution of one- and two - gluon wigner distributions over both the transverse momenta and impact parameters . </S>",
