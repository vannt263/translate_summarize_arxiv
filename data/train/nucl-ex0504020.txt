    "the study of elastic , refractive scattering of light systems , like and @xmath2o,@xmath10c+@xmath10c , has proven to be very helpful for our understanding of the interaction between heavy ions ( hi ) @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that the refractive structures or _ nuclear rainbow _ observed in the elastic scattering can provide information on the hi optical potential at small inter - nuclear distances .",
    "although most of the studies have been concentrated on the elastic scattering ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the system ) .",
    "the refractive effects have also been found and discussed for one - neutron transfer reactions in the @xmath10c+@xmath10c , @xmath11c+@xmath10c @xcite and systems @xcite .",
    "for example , in the system , where the elastic scattering has shown a pronounced nuclear rainbow pattern @xcite , a clear remnant of the rainbow pattern was identified in the 17o15 transfer cross section for the ground state transition to @xmath12o@xmath13 @xcite . beside the transfer channel , the inelastic scattering channel of a refractive system can also have a well defined rainbow pattern @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown recently by michel and ohkubo @xcite that the transparency seen in some light hi in the form of airy structure in the elastic scattering channel could have similar pattern in the inelastic scattering channel .    to complete our study @xcite of the refractive structure in the quasi - elastic scattering , we present in this work the results of our analysis in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) of the inelastic scattering data which have been measured in parallel with the elastic scattering at @xmath3 and 1120 mev @xcite .",
    "these data were taken for the transitions to the lowest 2@xmath0 and @xmath14 states in @xmath2o at 6.92 mev and 6.13 mev excitation energy , respectively , and cover about the same wide angular range as that covered by the elastic scattering and one - neutron transfer data .",
    "since the transition strengths of the 2@xmath4 and 3@xmath5 states of @xmath2o have been accurately determined from the @xmath6 data @xcite , they can serve as constraints for the deformation lengths used to generate the inelastic form factors for our dwba analysis . as a consequence ,",
    "the measured inelastic scattering data provide a good database for the study of refractive features in the inelastic scattering .",
    "a brief survey of the measurements of the inelastic scattering to the 2@xmath4 and 3@xmath5 states of @xmath2o is presented in sect .",
    "the basic ingredients of the semi - microscopic folding approach to calculate the optical potential and inelastic form factors for the optical model ( om ) and dwba analyses are given in sect .",
    "the dwba results of the analysis of the inelastic scattering data at @xmath15 mev are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] . a summary and",
    "the main conclusions of this work are given in sect .",
    "the experimental spectra have been taken at the incident energies @xmath17 mev @xcite using the q3d magnetic spectrograph at hmi , and at 704 and 1120 mev @xcite using the speg spectrograph at ganil .",
    "the spectral lines of the 3@xmath1 state at 6.13  mev and 2@xmath0 state at 6.92  mev were observed in these spectra as the strongest inelastic transitions .",
    "the method used to obtain the experimental cross sections of inelastic scattering from the analysis of the inelastic spectra is described in the following .",
    "since the projectile and target are identical particles and the same state can be excited in the projectile as well as in the target ( and also in both by mutual excitation ) , every excited state of @xmath18 appears in the spectrum _",
    "twice _ at the same position of the corresponding excitation energy : ( 1 ) a sharp line is observed for the target excitation , and ( 2 ) a broad line for the projectile excitation ( the mutual excitation could not be inferred from our data due to a small cross section and an increasing three - body background ) .",
    "the line - broadening observed for the excited states of the projectile is due to the recoil momentum of the photon emitted in - flight by the projectile .",
    "this effect is directly related to the doppler - broadening usually observed in the @xmath19-ray spectroscopy .",
    "the maximum energy shift in the laboratory system is given by @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 is the energy of the @xmath19-transition and @xmath22 is the velocity of the photon - emitting outgoing @xmath18 projectile .",
    "these maximum shifts can be rather large : at the forward scattering angles they are , e.g. , for the @xmath19-transition from the 2@xmath0 state at 6.92  mev to the ground state @xmath23  mev at the beam energy @xmath24  mev , and @xmath25  mev at @xmath26  mev ( angular shifts , which also result from the @xmath19-recoil , are small and not larger than the angular resolution ) .",
    "note that at 1120 mev , the base width of the broadened line is almost 5  mev wide , and this needs to be compared with the experimental energy resolution of about 0.5  mev at both incident energies .    in the spectrum of inelastic excitation",
    "the lines resulting from the target excitation are described by gaussians using the experimental resolution as the width , and the projectile excitation by rectangular distributions with base widths @xmath27 which were folded with the experimental resolution . for a given excited state the number of counts for the projectile and target excitation must be equal .",
    "this is required by the symmetry of the system which implies the _ equal _ excitation strengths of the same excited state in both the projectile and target nuclei at the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "scattering angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the gaussian line of the target excitation and the broad line of the projectile excitation have been first normalized to the same area before they were added .",
    "the resulting distributions were then fitted to the corresponding excited states in the spectrum by optimizing the normalizations .",
    "the fit can be performed simultaneously for several different excited states of @xmath18 with overlapping widths .",
    "[ f0 ] shows a spectrum of the inelastic scattering to the 3@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 excited states at 6.13  mev and 6.92  mev at @xmath30  mev and @xmath31 .",

    "mev and @xmath31 in the excitation energy region of the 3@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 excited states at 6.13 mev and 6.92 mev , respectively .",
    "the line shape used for the fit is described in the text . ]    in the analysis of the measured spectra we have used an experimental technique , where two - dimensional plots of scattering angle versus position in the focal plane are constructed to perform projections on either axis by applying specific gate conditions . to obtain spectra like that shown in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] it is necessary to set rather narrow angular gates ( typically @xmath32 at small angles and slightly larger at intermediate angles ) before the spectra are projected to the position axis .",
    "this procedure has been applied at the energies of 250 , 350 , 704 , and 1120  mev up to the scattering angles of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively , in the laboratory frame . as a result",
    ", the angular distributions of the 3@xmath1 state at 6.13  mev and 2@xmath0 state at 6.92  mev have been well separated in these angular ranges . at larger angles it was not possible to separate the 3@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 excited states using this method .",
    "their sum could be , however , easily projected when the gate in excitation energy was set in such a way that both broad lines were included within the acceptable energy limits ( in the energy range where other excited states of @xmath18 were not observed ) . in this way",
    ", the angular distribution of the total ( 2@xmath35 ) cross section has been projected for these states up to @xmath36 , and @xmath37 in the laboratory frame at the energies of 250 , 350 , and 704  mev , respectively . at 1120  mev",
    ", the range could not be extended due to a steep decrease of the cross sections . at 480  mev , only the angular distribution of the sum of the ( 2@xmath35 ) cross sections has been projected .",
    "we also note that the observed spectrum represents overwhelmingly the inelastic scattering to the 3@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 excited states at 6.13  mev and 6.92  mev , and the strength mixing by the 0@xmath0 and 1@xmath1 states at 6.05  mev and 7.12  mev can be neglected . while no peak has been observed for the 0@xmath0 state in the angular bin covered by our measurement , a slight rise caused by the 1@xmath1 state at 7.12  mev could be seen .",
    "the dipole excitation strength of the 1@xmath1 state is however too weak compared to those of the 3@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 states : @xmath38 w.u .",

    "the inelastic ff ( [ e2 ] ) is then given by the radial derivative of the op , scaled by a factor known as the deformation length .",

    "since the density - dependent parameters of the cdm3y6 interaction were adjusted to reproduce correctly saturation properties of the _ infinite _ nuclear matter , to use this interaction for a system of two _ finite _ nuclei one needs to take into account the kinematical transformation from the nn frame to the frame .",

    "the enhanced absorption found for the exit channels of the inelastic scattering and 17o15 transfer reaction stresses the need to have a realistic choice for the op not only in the entrance but also in the exit channel .",
    "the use of the same complex op in both the entrance and exit channels might lead to a large uncertainty in the deduced transition strength if one follows the standard method of scaling the inelastic ff to match the dwba results to the measured angular distributions .",
    "in particular , one needs to be aware of this effect while analyzing the inelastic scattering data measured at ` refractive ' energies for a light hi system containing an unstable nucleus with the excited state being either unbound or very weakly bound .",
    "we note finally that the subtle effect of absorption enhancement could have been found only owing to very accurately measured inelastic scattering and one - neutron 17o15 transfer data which cover a wide angular range and about 6 orders of the cross - section magnitude .     but for @xmath90 mev . ]",
    "we consider now the refractive features in the inelastic scattering in more details , and the best data set for this purpose are those measured at @xmath90 mev . at this energy ,",
    "a broad shoulder - like primary rainbow pattern preceded by the first airy minimum at @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 @xmath121 ) has been observed in the elastic scattering cross section ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) . from the dwba results given by the same op in the entrance and exit channel ( dotted and dash - dotted curves ) for the inelastic scattering at 350 mev shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] one can see a weak rise in the sum of the 2@xmath0 and @xmath14 cross sections at @xmath122 .",
    "this broad pattern at large angles is about the same for the 2@xmath0 and @xmath14 cross sections ( with overlayed oscillatory structures at the forward angles which are out of phase ) and should be of the refractive nature and caused by the same interference mechanism that gives rise to the airy oscillation seen in the elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "note that the rainbow shoulder is slightly shifted towards large angles because of a small decrease of the c.m .",
    "energy in the exit channel . this structure becomes weaker if one uses a more absorptive op in the exit channels to reproduce the measured ( 2@xmath35 ) cross section as discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , a remnant of the primary rainbow shoulder can still be seen separately in the calculated 2@xmath0 and @xmath14 cross sections as well as in the measured total cross section . from the calculated and measured cross sections at all energies shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] one can trace this weak rainbow pattern in the inelastic scattering cross section from the energy of 350 mev up to 704 mev .     but for @xmath89 mev . ]    at 250 mev , the nuclear rainbow pattern of the elastic scattering was shown to be shifted to scattering angles larger than @xmath123 @xcite and there it is invisible due to the strong mott interference .",
    "that is also the reason why one can not see it in the inelastic scattering .",
    "interestingly , the enhancement of absorption found at higher energies is not very obvious at 250 mev where the results given by the same op for both the entrance and exit channels deliver also a fairly good description of the measured data ( see fig .  [ f5 ] ) .",
    "we have seen the same trend in our recent dwba analysis of the one - neutron 17o15 reaction @xcite , where the enhanced absorption in the exit channel was also not observed at 250 mev .",
    "it is very likely that the enhancement of the absorption in the exit channel is a feature associated with the refractive nature of quasi - elastic scattering .",
    "such an effect can be well expected from the interpretation of the rainbow scattering as a phenomenon associated with a _ weak absorption _ which allows a _ deeper interpenetration _ of the two nuclei , with the refractive pattern determined by the potential at small distances @xcite .",
    "given a weak rainbow pattern seen in the inelastic scattering cross section at the energies of 350 - 704 mev , one might also expect some sensibility of the measured inelastic data to the shape of the form factor at small distances . to probe this effect",
    ", we have constructed the transition form factors ( [ e2 ] ) using both the folding and dop methods . to obtain the dop form factors , we have first deformed the ( best - fit ) elastic folded potential by the same deformation lengths @xmath61 as that used to generate the nuclear transition densities ( [ e8 ] ) for the folding calculation . although the two choices of the ff have more or less the same strength at the surface of the dinuclear system , they differ from each other substantially at small radii ( compare the solid and dotted curves in fig .",
    "this difference shows up clearly in the calculated inelastic cross section and one can see from fig .",
    "[ f7 ] that a reasonable dwba description of the data by the dop form factors can only be reached when the deformation lengths @xmath124 used in the dop model are substantially reduced , especially , for the @xmath125 case where @xmath126 has to be reduced by a factor around 1.67 . the corresponding transition rate",
    "is then reduced to @xmath127@xmath65 which is nearly three times smaller than the adopted experimental value of @xmath128@xmath65 @xcite .",
    "such a deficiency of the dop form factor , which leads to an artificial  hindrance \" of the @xmath14 excitation strength , has been first pointed out by beene et al .",
    "@xcite and is now confirmed again by our folding + dwba analysis of the inelastic scattering . moreover , with the inelastic scattering data covering a wide angular range , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] that the dop method completely fails to give a good description of the data points at largest angles which are known to be sensitive to the shape of the ff at small distances . like the rainbow pattern in the elastic scattering which can be used to probe the real op at small internuclear distances @xcite , we have established that the weak remnant of the primary rainbow observed in the inelastic scattering at 350 mev is also helpful in testing the inelastic ff at small radii .     in the inelastic scattering at 350 mev .",
    "the folded @xmath70 form factor is the solid curve , the dop curves represent the best - fit elastic folded potential deformed with the same deformation length @xmath126 as that used to generate @xmath70 ( dotted curve ) or with @xmath126 adjusted to the best dwba fit to the inelastic scattering data ( dashed curve ) . ]     mev in comparison with the measured 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath1 inelastic cross sections and their sum .",
    "the solid curves were obtained with the same folded form factors @xmath129 as those discussed in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , dotted curves were obtained with the dop form factors built upon the same deformation lengths @xmath124 as those used to generate @xmath129 , and dashed curves are the dop results but with @xmath124 adjusted to the best dwba fit to the data . ]",
    "inelastic scattering data at @xmath3 and 1120 mev for the transitions to the lowest 2@xmath0 and @xmath14 states in @xmath2o , covering the same wide angular range as that covered by the elastic scattering at these energies @xcite , have been measured and analyzed within the dwba using the semi - microscopic optical potential and inelastic form factor given by the folding model @xcite .",
    "although the refractive pattern of the inelastic scattering was found less pronounced compared to that observed in the elastic scattering channel , a similar evolution of the primary rainbow remnant could still be traced in the inelastic scattering cross section up to @xmath130 mev .",
    "given the strengths of the folded form factors fixed by the deformation lengths determined from the experimental @xmath131 and @xmath132 data @xcite , a reasonable dwba description of the measured 2@xmath0 and @xmath14 angular distributions has been obtained only if the absorption in exit channels is significantly increased , especially for the @xmath2o+@xmath2o@xmath133 exit , at the energies where the refractive ( rainbow ) pattern was well observed in the elastic scattering channel .",
    "our dwba analysis also shows consistently that the considered inelastic scattering to the lowest 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath1 states of @xmath2o exhausts mainly the strength of the _ real _ part of the inelastic form factor ( [ e10 ] ) . in terms of feshbach",
    "s formalism @xcite , these results should indicate the dominance of the direct ( one - step ) inelastic scattering and negligible contribution from higher order terms to the reaction .",
    "the enhanced absorption found for the exit channels of the inelastic scattering and 17o15 transfer reaction @xcite indicates that the nuclear mean free path is decreasing during the transition from the entrance channel containing two tightly bound double closed - shell @xmath2o nuclei in their ground states to a _ less bound _",
    "exit channel containing either @xmath12o nucleus or @xmath2o nucleus in the excited 2@xmath0 or 3@xmath1 states .",
    "this would be of interest to study this effect in the future analysis of the quasi - elastic scattering data measured for the systems involving unstable nuclei , where the partitions in the entrance and exit channels are very differently bound .",
    "the weak rainbow remnant observed in the inelastic scattering was shown to be quite helpful in testing the inelastic ff at small radii .",
    "a comparison made between the folding and dop models for the inelastic form factor shows clearly the failure of the dop approach in the description of the inelastic scattering data at 350 mev , which cover both the diffractive and refractive regions in the angular distribution .",
    "the use of the dop model also significantly underestimates the deformation lengths of the nuclear excitations , especially for @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we recommend again the folding model as a more reliable tool in the analysis of the inelastic scattering .",
