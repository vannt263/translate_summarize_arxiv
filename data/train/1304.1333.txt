    "p09 is optimized for resonant and non - resonant elastic scattering and diffraction experiments in the tender to hard x - ray range .",
    "two diffractometers are located in two different experimental hutches : one for standard sample environments such as small cryostats or furnaces and another one for heavy sample environment setups .",
    "a 14  t dc magnet is also available .",
    "it is equipped with a variable temperature insert ( vti ) and an optional @xmath0he probe . in a third experimental hutch",
    ", beamline p09 hosts the hard x - ray photo - electron spectroscopy ( haxpes ) station .",
    "this paper will focus exclusively on the resonant scattering and diffraction ( rsd ) stations .",
    "the beamline is dedicated to resonant x - ray diffraction ( rxd ) experiments , in which the scattering cross section is strongly polarization dependent .",
    "however , various scattering and diffraction experiments in need of high photon flux , variable energy , variable polarization , focused beam are also possible .",
    "this includes investigation of reflectivities or superlattice reflections as a function of temperature , electric or magnetic fields in bulk samples , thin films or multilayer systems using linear or circular polarization , as well as in - situ characterization of sample growth in heavy chambers . with the highly focused x - ray beam ,",
    "diffraction experiments from small single crystals or single domains within a larger multi - domain sample are possible .",
    "the rxd technique is nowadays widely used in various fields @xcite and has been applied extensively to the investigation of electronic order in solids @xcite . by tuning the x - ray energy close to an absorption edge , virtual multipole transitions are induced and the scattering process becomes sensitive to the intermediate states into which the core electrons are excited . from this a strong sensitivity to local environments and asymmetries in the electron distribution arises which can have various origins , such as charge , spin or multipolar order and can give rise to diffracted intensity at structurally forbidden positions in reciprocal space or an enhancement of weak magnetic reflections .",
    "the anisotropic tensor of susceptibility ( ats ) @xcite describes the polarization dependent nature of the diffracted intensities at forbidden reflections at the absorption edges .",
    "ats scattering originally was applied exclusively to the investigation of purely structural anisotropies .",
    "independent from that , magnetic rxd was discovered @xcite , which yields , dependent on the type of transitions , strong resonant enhancement of the weak magnetic intensities of magnetic superlattice reflections .",
    "the sensitivity of rxd to magnetic order in the following years was extensively used to investigate magnetic ordering phenomena as a function of temperature , external magnetic field or pressure as a complementary probe to neutron diffraction .",
    "the element sensitivity of xrd was used to distinguish between contributions of different elements to the magnetic ordering .",
    "ats scattering was later applied to orbital and charge ordering @xcite and since then also to the investigation of higher multipolar order terms .    from the original description of the resonant magnetic cross section @xcite until now ,",
    "theory has advanced considerably and the description of the different resonant diffraction phenomena has been greatly unified by the so - called multipole expansion of the electric and magnetic state of matter @xcite .",
    "this provides a wide field of ordering phenomena to be investigated .    at p09 , all requirements for state of the art resonant and non - resonant scattering experiments are met , which include energy tunability , the possibility of vertical as well as horizontal scattering , manipulation of incident polarization , analysis of the polarization of the diffracted beam , variable beam focus and higher harmonic suppression in the whole energy range .",
    "the beamline covers the absorption edges in the energy range from 2.7 to 24 kev , which include the 4d l - edges ( mo , ru , rh , ... ) , the 5f m - edges ( u ) , the 4f l - edges , the 3d k - edges and the 5d l - edges . for experiments at low photon energies , p09 is virtually windowless except for a 20  diamond window which separates the ring from the beamline vacuum .",
    "beamline p09 is located at the 3@xmath1 generation synchrotron source petra iii at desy , which became operational in 2009 @xcite .",
    "the petra iii storage ring has a circumference of 2.3 km .",
    "it accommodates 9 straight sections corresponding to 9 sectors in the experimental hall covering 1/8th of the ring circumference . in total",
    ", 14 beamlines are installed using canted 2  m undulators with a canting angle of 5  mrad in 5 sectors , 5  m undulators in 3 sectors and a @xmath2  m undulator in the first sector .",
    "petra iii sets itself apart from other synchrotron sources due to its low horizontal emittance of 1 nmrad .",
    "the lower emittance directly translates into a reduced horizontal photon source size and beam divergence and into a high brilliance for all beamlines .",
    "petra iii operates at 6.084  gev ring energy .",
    "the ring current is injected in top - up mode with 480 ( eventually 960 ) bunch filling pattern and 100  ma ring current in normal operation .",
    "reduced bunch modes with 60 and 40 bunches are used for timing experiments .",
    "p09 is located at sector 6 of the petra iii experimental hall .",
    "it shares the sector with beamline p08 , the high resolution diffraction beamline @xcite .",
    "the two beamlines are using two separate undulators canted by an angle of 5 mrad .",
    "the undulators are placed in a high-@xmath3 section of the storage ring , where the calculated rms photon source sizes and divergences at 8 kev are @xmath4  @xmath5 ( h@xmath6v ) and @xmath7  @xmath8 rad@xmath5 ( h@xmath6v ) , respectively . at p09 ,",
    "a 2 m long u32 spectroscopy undulator is used with a period length of @xmath9=31.4 mm and a peak field of b@xmath10=0.91 t @xcite .",
    "it generates a continuous energy spectrum via gap scanning with a transition from  to  harmonic at an energy of 8.8 kev as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_mirror ] .",
    "the lowest gap size is 9.8 mm allowing for a minimum energy of 2.7 kev at the first harmonic .",
    "water - cooled power slits in the beamline front - end are used to shape the beam and to reduce the heat - load by cutting off the low energy halo around the central cone .",
    "in fig .  [ fig_sect6 ] we show the different optical elements at p09 and their distances from the source .",
    "the optics hutch p09-oh starts at 45.2  m. the first component is the high heat - load double - crystal fixed - exit monochromator ( dcm ) ( fmb oxford , osney mead , uk ) located at 46.5  m. the vertical offset of the monochromatic beam relative to the white beam is 21  mm .",
    "a horizontal translation of the whole monochromator tank perpendicular to the beam allows switching between si(111 ) or si(311 ) crystal pairs . both pairs",
    "are cryogenically cooled with liquid n@xmath11 .",
    "because of the smaller darwin width of the si(311 ) bragg reflection , the energy resolution can be improved by almost a factor 5 when using si(311 ) instead of si(111 ) at the expense of a factor 5 in photon flux .",
    "the energy bandwidth is @xmath12 and @xmath13 or in absolute units 1 ( 0.5 )  ev and 0.2 ( 0.1 )  ev , respectively , at 8 ( 4 )  kev .",
    "the lowest energy at which si(311 ) crystal pairs can be used is 5.2  kev , corresponding to a maximum monochromator angle of currently 46.7 .",
    "quad beam position monitors ( qbpms ) ( fmb - oxford ) at 51  m in p09-oh and at 72.6  m in the experimental hutch ( p09-eh1 ) equipped with 0.5  ni and ti foils can be used to stabilize the beam position as well as its direction by adjusting position and pitch of the second monochromator crystal .",
    "downstream of the monochromator at 49.7  m , the double phase - retarder setup can be used to vary the polarization of the incident monochromatic beam .",
    "it is followed by two 1  m long vertically reflecting mirrors at 52.3 and 54.4  m used for focusing and higher harmonics rejection .",
    "the position of the sample at the center of rotation of the diffractometers is at 76.7  m in p09-eh1 and at 86.5  m in p09-eh2 .",
    "the vacuum at the optical components is maintained at pressures below @xmath14  mbar up to the 20  thick diamond x - ray window ( diamond materials , freiburg ) at the entrance to p09-eh1 . in p09-eh1 , 3  m in front of the sample position , a 3@xmath1 300",
    "mm long quartz mirror is available to further suppress higher harmonics in the low energy regime below 4  kev .",
    "additional focusing at fixed energy can be achieved using compound refractive lenses ( crls ) @xcite . in the following , the double phase - retarder setup , the double mirror setup and the crl setup",
    "are explained in more detail .",
    "magnetic structures are usually determined through the investigation of the scattered intensity as a function of the azimuth .",
    "however such measurements imply a rotation of the sample around the scattering vector together with the whole sample environment ( _ i.e. _ cryostat or magnet ) over a large angular range of the azimuth at different scattering vectors which is not always possible",
    ". moreover , different grains of the sample often scatter at different azimuthal angles and thus make such measurements extremely difficult .",
    "these difficulties can be overcome using polarization scans _",
    "i.e. _ the generation of incident linearly polarized x rays at a variable angle @xmath15 of the linear polarization plane around the beam direction and the analysis of the dependence on @xmath15 of the stokes parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the diffracted signal from a sample @xcite . after its first implementation at beamline id20 at esrf @xcite , this method has become a routine requirement due to its versatility .",
    "polarization scans allow disentangling between different contributions to the resonant scattering cross - section as was first shown by mazzoli _",
    "et al._@xcite . for magnetic resonant and non - resonant scattering experiments ,",
    "full polarization scans are used to determine the magnetic moment orientation @xcite .",
    "in addition , circular polarization with the possibility of fast switching between left and right circular polarization is of great importance , since it can be used to determine properties of chiral magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "a sketch of a diffraction experiment with phase - plates and polarization analyzer is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scattgeo ] .",
    "circular and rotated linear polarization can be obtained using quarter wave plates ( qwp ) and half wave plates ( hwp ) , respectively . in the hard x - ray regime ,",
    "qwp and hwp conditions can be obtained by using perfect crystals and slightly detuning them from the ideal bragg condition @xcite .",
    "the actual phase shift depends on the deviation angle from the bragg position .",
    "the double phase - retarder setup is mounted in a uhv vacuum tank and consists of two eulerian cradles , @xmath18 and @xmath19 separated by 340 mm ( huber diffraktionstechnik , rimsting , germany ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pr ] ) . on each of them two high resolution rotation stages",
    "are mounted opposite to each other acting as @xmath20 and @xmath21 circles .",
    "the @xmath20-circles are equipped with a @xmath2210 mm translation making it possible to switch between 3 phase - retarding plates .",
    "a piezo - actuator below the plates allows oscillation with frequencies of up to 40 hz for fast switching the helicity of circular polarization . on the @xmath21 stages , passivated implanted planar silicon ( pips ) diodes ( canberra ) are located which monitor the diffracted intensity .",
    "the two eulerian cradles are mounted on separate @xmath23- and @xmath24-stages .",
    "their axes of rotation are aligned towards each other within a precision of better than 0.1 .",
    "the rotation axis of one of them can be aligned precisely along the beam axis using yaw and pitch rotations . as a result ,",
    "bragg peaks remain in diffraction condition within @xmath25 arcsec when @xmath19 is rotated between 0 and @xmath26  and within @xmath2210 arcsec when @xmath18 is rotated between 0 and @xmath27 .    currently , two identical sets of synthetic type ib diamond phase plates are mounted on the two @xmath18 and @xmath19 stages : two diamond plates of 100 and 200 @xmath8 m thickness with the [ 111 ] direction as surface normal and one diamond plate of 400 @xmath8 m thickness with the [ 100 ] direction as surface normal .",
    "each plate is oriented such that the ( 111 ) and ( 111 ) reflections can be set in diffraction condition , which allows an extension of the usable energy range of each plate owing to the different glancing angles onto the ( 111 ) planes . in fig .",
    "[ fig_400mu ] the deviation angles from the bragg position necessary to achieve the quarter wave plate condition ( qwp ) are shown for the 400  @xmath8 m ( 100 ) plate for two different glancing angles . depending on which plate is used and which reflection is set diffracting , the plates are either used in the asymmetric laue geometry or the symmetric bragg geometry .",
    "the present set of diamond phase plates allows manipulation of the polarization of the incident x rays in the energy range between 3.5 and 8 kev .",
    "linear polarization scans are carried out using either one single hwp or two qwps in series and rotating their scattering planes around the x - ray beam .",
    "scagnoli  have shown @xcite that using two qwps in series in a 90  geometry , _ i.e. _ @xmath28 , allows compensation for depolarisation effects due mostly to the energy spread , while two qwps in series in an antiparallel geometry , _ i.e. _ @xmath29 , compensate for depolarization effects due to the angular divergence .",
    "the angular divergence is very low at p09 and can be neglected .",
    "the energy spread on the other hand contributes an angular spread of more than 10 arcsec at energies below 9  kev , which is non negligible .",
    "the combination of two qwps in the 90  geometry results in a 5 to 10% higher degree of linear polarization @xmath30 than ( i ) using one single hwp of half the total effective thickness @xcite and ( ii ) using two qwps in the parallel geometry , _ i.e. _ @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "an example of the direct beam polarization properties for two qwps in series in the 90  geometry at the mn k - edge energy is given in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_400mu ] .",
    "the degree of linear polarization @xmath32 is 96.8(1.7)% in average .",
    "it is foreseen in the near future to change to synthetic type iia diamond plates for which qwp deviation angles as low as 20 arcsec can be used @xcite . right now , the minimum deviation angles for the type ib diamond plates used at p09 are 40 arcsec @xcite .",
    "type iia synthetic diamonds produced by the temperature gradient growth method at high temperature and high pressure are better quality than type ib diamonds regarding lattice strain and crystal defect structures as well as regarding the amount of impurities and inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "a previous study has shown that while synthetic type iia diamonds show a typical broadening of the darwin width of up to 5 arcsec over the whole crystal , synthetic type ib diamonds show a width broadening of up to 20 arcsec @xcite .",
    "a direct benefit will be the larger usable energy range of each crystal and a higher transmission rate at the lowest deviation angles .",
    "the type iia diamond phase - plates will cover the energy range from 3.2 to 14 kev . a set of 10 @xmath8 m thin silicon phase plates will cover the energy range between 2.7 and 3.2 kev @xcite .",
    "an additional double phase - retarder setup allowing operation of two plates in series in the 90  geometry has been designed to fit at the optical table in p09-eh1 in front of the transfocator and the beam monitor for variable polarization in p09-eh1 and p09-eh2 .",
    "this device is not in vacuum and will accommodate the thick type iia diamond plates ( @xmath33 m ) .",
    "the mirrors in p09-oh are 1  m long and 130  mm wide fused silica ( sio@xmath11 ) mirrors with averaged slope errors over 800  mm length of @xmath34  @xmath8rad ( rms ) sagittal , @xmath35  @xmath8rad ( rms ) meridional and surface roughness @xmath36  nm ( rms ) . in order to preserve parallel beam",
