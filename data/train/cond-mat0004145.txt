    "the experimental discovery of quasicrystalline alloys  @xcite led to extensive work on space tilings over the last 15 years , as it became clear that quasiperiodic , and not only periodic , structures could play important role in solid state physics .",
    "indeed , the atomic structure of the highest quality quasicrystals has been found to follow closely the 3-dimensional icosahedral analogues of the celebrated pentagonal penrose tilings  @xcite . among the many questions that are still open in this field , the origin of their stability is one of the",
    "mostly highly debated .",
    "physical explanations range from an electronic stabilization mechanism ( refinements on the old hume - rothery approach ) to an original entropic stabilization , allowed by specific phason modes which can be generated in quasiperiodic tilings .",
    "our purpose here is not to discuss the relative merits of the different mechanisms , but to analyze in detail the combinatorial problems associated with configurational entropy in random tilings .",
    "this paper follows a previous one  @xcite in which the general framework was introduced , as well as specific results concerning codimension - one tilings .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional random tilings of interest are made of rhombi ( @xmath0=2 ) or rhombohedra ( @xmath0=3 ) , or even higher dimensional analogues .",
    "these tilings are projections onto a @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space of a @xmath0-dimensional faceted membrane cut into a @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the `` codimension '' of a tiling is the difference @xmath3 , and the the tiling is said to be of type @xmath4 . in reference",
    "@xcite , we discussed the codimension - one case for tilings with specific ( fixed ) boundary conditions .",
    "this allows us to write a one - to - one correspondence between tilings and combinatorial objects , called partitions .",
    "we built a geometrical description of the partition configuration space in terms of integral points in a high dimensional space , the entropy being computed from the integral volume of a specific convex polytope in that space .",
    "the occurrence of multiplicative and additive formulas for this volume was analyzed in detail , and given a simple geometrical meaning in the latter case in terms of a simplicial decomposition of the convex polytope .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the analysis of random tilings of higher codimension , starting with the simplest @xmath5 case . studying these cases",
    "is of direct importance in the context of quasicrystal physics , since all the quasiperiodic tilings encountered in this field are of codimension greater than one ( @xmath6 for the pentagonal penrose tiling , and @xmath7 in the icosahedral case ) .",
    "tilings of type @xmath8 correspond to the so - called octagonal family , which was also observed in concrete alloys  @xcite .",
    "although they are the simplest , `` octagonal '' random tilings",
    "already present most of the difficulties which , up to now , have forbidden the derivation of exact results for the large class of random tilings derived from hypercubic tilings  @xcite .",
    "note that exact results exist ( for the entropy ) for other kinds of tilings , such as the square - triangle tiling  @xcite , rectangle - triangle tilings  @xcite , or large codimension tilings  @xcite .",
    "note however that the present point of view does not apply to the two first examples since there exist no partition representation for such tilings .",
    "our analysis for the @xmath5 tilings follow from a generalization of the simple partition problem , valid in case of codimension one , to an iterated partition problem , which was proposed earlier  @xcite , and has already led to some preliminary numerical results . here",
    "we describe the intricacy of the configuration space , which is no longer convex `` as a whole '' , but remains convex by parts .",
    "we show that despite its complexity , some exact but partial enumerative results can be obtained , although we must stress that the ultimate goal   an exact formula for the entropy   was not obtained and seems out of reach for the moment .",
    "we nevertheless believe that the present analysis is an important step in at least two directions : we give a very precise description of the configuration space and its simplex decomposition and we point out several very closely related problems in combinatorics , like the enumeration of sorting algorithms ( [ somme.des.aj ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 1 recalls some older results and definitions , in particular the concept of de bruijn lines and faceted membranes , and the bijection between standard partitions and codimension - one tilings .",
    "section 2 focuses on higher codimension tilings , by introducing `` generalized '' partitions , and describing the particular structure that is inherited by the configuration space .",
    "its properties in terms of local rearrangements of tiles ( flips ) are analyzed in detail . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the decomposition of the configuration space into normal simplices , and we show the latter can be characterized thanks to a `` descent theorem '' .",
    "this allows us to compute new enumerative formulas which were inaccessible by `` brute - force '' methods ; these formulas are displayed in section 4 .    even though this paper focuses on two - dimensional tilings and more precisely on octagonal ones , some results",
    "can easily be generalized to higher dimensional systems .",
    "the state of the art in the @xmath9 cases is briefly discussed in  [ cycles ] .",
    "in this paper we consider 2-dimensional tilings of rhombic tiles which fill a region of the euclidean space without gaps or overlaps .",
    "the standard method for generating such structures consists of a selection of sites and tiles in a 4-dimensional lattice according to certain rules , followed by a projection onto the 2-dimensional subspace along a generic direction .",
    "we then say that we have a @xmath10 tiling problem , or an octagonal one , in reference to the sub - class of ideal quasiperiodic ammann tilings which have octagonal symmetry .",
    "the above procedure is also known as the `` cut - and - project '' method @xcite . by construction , the so - obtained rhombic tiles are the projections of the 2-dimensional facets of the 4-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "there are 6 different species of tiles , two squares and four 45 degree rhombi .",
    "figures  [ worms ] and [ ex42 ] show examples . in the cut - and - project language",
    "the difference between the higher and the lower dimensions is called the tiling _",
    "codimension_. in this case it is equal to 2 .",
    "we first recall some definitions and results which will prove to be useful throughout this paper .",
    "these definitions are given in a slightly more general context than the octagonal case .",
    "the higher dimension will be denoted by @xmath1 and the lower one by @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , it should be mentioned that there exist two related classes of objects which can be put in one - to - one correspondence with random tilings : _ de bruijn grids _ on the one hand , and _ directed membranes _ on the other hand .",
    "de bruijn grids @xcite are dual representations of tilings which can be useful to state or prove some results concerning tilings .",
    "there are a great number of publications dealing with these grids in the scientific literature ( for example , see @xcite ) , therefore we shall not give a complete presentation of these objects .",
    "instead we shall give them an intuitive definition in the case of two - dimensional tilings .",
    "de bruijn grids are made up of lines , the so - called de bruijn lines , which are also called `` worms '' .",
    "these lines join together the middles of opposite edges of rhombic tiles .",
    "since the tiles are rhombi , it is always possible to extend these lines through the tiling up to the boundary .",
    "such lines are displayed in figure  [ worms ] .",
    "any tile is crossed by two lines .",
    "there is no triple intersection point ( condition of _ regularity _ ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are lines which can never intersect , even in an infinite tiling .",
    "they join rhombus edges of the same orientation , as illustrated in figure  [ worms ] .",
    "we say that these lines belong to the same family .",
    "a family is in correspondence with an edge orientation . in a @xmath11 tiling , there are @xmath1 edge orientations and therefore @xmath1 families of de bruijn lines .",
    "the relevant object here is not the grid itself but the underlying intersection topology , which defines the tiling : a grid can be directly read on a tiling by joining together the middles of opposite edges , but it can afterwards be continuously deformed provided no triple point appears in the process .",
    "this grid and the tiling are said to be _",
    "dual_. in the following , we will sometimes distinguish between the terms `` worms '' , which are sequences of rhombi of a tiling , and `` de bruijn lines '' , which are elements of a grid in an abstract grid space , with no underlying tiling any longer .",
    "conversely , it can be proven that , given such a grid , it is possible to build a unique tiling , the de bruijn grid of which is identical to the grid under consideration  @xcite .",
    "two lines of two different families can but need not intersect . a grid where all lines of all families intersect is said to be _ complete_. in this case , to insure the existence of all intersections , we impose that , `` far '' from the intersection region , the lines are perpendicular to vectors @xmath12 , one per family",
    ". the lines of a given family are therefore parallel at the infinity",
    ".    directed faceted membranes are representations of tilings in hypercubic lattices of higher dimensions , which have been developed to study random tilings in parallel with the partition method ( see below ) @xcite .",
    "they are the generalization of one - dimensional directed walks ( or polymers ) in hypercubic lattices .",
    "this point of view is closely related to the cut - and - project method .",
    "therefore we shall only give a brief presentation of these membranes .",
    "the main idea is that a @xmath9 random tiling can be lifted as a @xmath0-dimensional non - flat structure embedded in a @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "this structure is a _ continuous membrane _ made of @xmath0-dimensional facets of the @xmath13 hypercubic lattice . when this membrane is projected along the suitable direction , the projections of these facets are precisely the tiles the tilings are made of ; its continuous character guarantees the absence of gaps in the so - obtained tiling .",
    "such a membrane is said to be _ directed _ to emphasize the fact that its projection does not create any overlap .",
    "for example , figure  [ ex.memb ] displays a @xmath14 tiling , which can also be seen as a 2-dimensional non - flat directed membrane embedded in a cubic lattice . to get a tiling",
    ", this membrane must be projected along the @xmath15 direction of the cubic lattice .",
    "this point of view can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions and codimensions .",
    "this correspondence is always one - to - one .",
    "it is possible to derive from this membrane representation a coding of random tilings by combinatorial objects called `` partitions ''  @xcite .",
    "this point of view is easily understood when looking at figure  [ ex.memb ] : the membrane can be seen as a stacking of unit cubes in 3 dimensions and an integral height ( the number of cubes ) can be assigned to each of the @xmath16 columns of this stacking , resulting in a @xmath17 array containing integers . since the original membrane is directed , these numbers are decreasing in each row and in each column of this two - dimensional array .",
    "this latter array is called a _",
    "plane partition _ and each integer a _",
    "part_. in this representation , the integer @xmath18 is called _ the height _ of the partition .",
    "it is the upper bound of each part .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between such partitions and membranes embedded in a @xmath19 piece of cubic lattice .",
    "there is a straightforward generalization of this point of view to @xmath20 membranes and @xmath1-dimensional partitions ( called _ hypersolid partitions _ ) , which are families of integers arranged in @xmath1-dimensional arrays , decreasing in each direction ( for more complete details , see reference  @xcite , sections 2.1 and 2.2 ) .    in the following section ,",
    "we generalize this partition point of view to any codimension tilings , which enables us to build their configuration space .",
    "this general point of view was only briefly tackled in previous references @xcite .",
    "it was developed and formalized in reference  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we show how it is possible to code octagonal tilings , or more generally @xmath9 tilings , as _ generalized partitions _ , that is families of integral variables , but living on structures more complex than the previous rectangular arrays .",
    "these structures will turn out to be the dual graphs of relevant rhombus tilings .",
    "our goal in this section is to prove that @xmath9 tilings can also be coded by `` generalized partitions on @xmath21 tilings '' .",
    "let us explain what this terminology means",
    ".    generally speaking , we define a _ partition problem _ as a family of @xmath22 integral variables , denoted by @xmath23 , placed at the vertices of a directed graph , so that any two variables placed at two adjacent vertices satisfy an order relation in agreement with the orientation of the edge between those vertices . the general case will be discussed in  [ cycles ] . ] .",
    "the underlying directed graph is called the _ base _ of the partition problem . to simplify",
    ", we shall consider that all order relations are weak ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the integral values are between 0 and an integer @xmath18 , called the _",
    "height _ of the partition problem .",
    "a solution of this problem is called a partition , of height @xmath18 .",
    "the integral variables @xmath25 are called the _ parts_. figure  [ ex.gen.part ] displays an example .       in reference  @xcite , we mainly studied hypersolid partitions , the graph of which is equivalent to a piece a hypercubic lattice , in the context of codimension - one partition problems ( see above , section  [ codim1 ] ) .    to introduce the tiling coding by partitions",
    ", we shall work in the grid representation .",
    "we focus here on the @xmath11 case ( the presentation of the general @xmath9 case would require some more definitions and refinements",
    ". the interested reader will refer to references  @xcite ; see also  [ cycles ] ) .",
    "let us consider a @xmath11 grid .",
    "we single out a family of lines , which can be chosen as the @xmath1-th one without loss of generality .",
    "it contains @xmath26 de bruijn lines .",
    "the @xmath27 remaining families define a new grid .",
    "we call it a _ subgrid _ of the first one .",
    "our goal is now to build a partition on this subgrid that codes the initial tiling : a part will be attached to each vertex of this subgrid .",
    "firstly , we need to introduce the so - called _",
    "interline indices_. since they do not intersect , the @xmath26 singled out lines divide the plane in @xmath28 domains .",
    "these domains are unambiguously labeled from 0 to @xmath26 in the simplest way : two adjacent domains are labeled by two successive numbers which are increasing in the direction of @xmath29 ( as defined in section  [ grids ] ) .",
    "now the value of the part attached to a subgrid vertex is simply equal to the interline index of the domain in which this subgrid vertex lies .",
    "the maximum height of these parts is @xmath26 .",
    "there is a more simple way of characterizing the order between these parts : since a de bruijn line of the subgrid is transverse to all the lines of the @xmath1-th family , the parts on this line are ordered in the same direction as the interline indices .",
    "therefore we have defined a `` canonical '' order on every subgrid line .",
    "we say that we have ordered those de bruijn lines . by convention",
    ", we chose those lines to be ordered in the direction of _ decreasing parts _ ( we insist on this point because it is a source of confusion ) .",
    "now , since any two adjacent vertices of the subgrid are joined by such a line , we have ordered any two parts .",
    "therefore we have defined on this subgrid a partition problem of height @xmath26 . to sum up",
    ", we have coded any @xmath30 grid as a pair : a @xmath31 subgrid and a partition on it .    conversely , given such a pair , the @xmath11 grid from which this pair comes can be easily re - constructed .",
    "one must add the @xmath1-th family of lines in such a way that all the vertices of the subgrid lie in the interline , the index of which is equal to the part attached to this vertex .",
    "the constraints on the parts insure that we actually obtain a @xmath11 de bruijn grid .    in conclusion",
    ", we have derived a one - to - one mapping between @xmath30 grids and partitions on @xmath31 subgrids , the parts being suitably ordered on oriented de bruijn lines .",
    "a more mathematical formulation , related to this work , can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "this mapping can be translated in the tiling ( or directed membrane ) language : the generalized partitions can be defined on the suitably oriented dual graphs of the corresponding @xmath31 tilings . for short ,",
    "we call them `` partitions on tilings ''",
    ".    figure  [ part.gen.42 ] provides an example of @xmath10 tiling seen as a partition on a @xmath14 tiling",
    ". the @xmath14 tiling has been slightly deformed to anticipate the next step of the process .",
    "note that parts are ordered on each de bruijn line ( or worm ) .",
    "once the partition has been chosen , zones where parts are equal are separated by bold lines , which are `` opened '' to form worms ( shaded ) of width 1 .",
    "this step is the manifestation in the tiling representation of the fourth de bruijn family .       to conclude this paragraph",
    ", we shall say that a @xmath9 tiling problem can be studied as a collection of partition problems on a set of ( dual graphs of ) @xmath32 tilings . even though we have only proved this point in the @xmath10 case , the demonstration can be generalized  @xcite .",
    "practically , to build a @xmath9 tiling , one can iterate a partition - on - tiling process .",
    "the first step is simply a codimension - one partition on a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic array .",
    "it generates a @xmath33 tiling .",
    "the next steps increase @xmath1 by one each .",
    "therefore there are @xmath3 steps .",
    "as compared to usual random tilings , partition - generated ones have specific polygonal boundary conditions .",
    "for example , the tiling in figure  [ ex.memb ] have a hexagonal boundary . in the case of @xmath34 tilings ,",
    "the polygon is an octagon of sides @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see figure  [ part.gen.42 ] ) .",
    "more generally , such tilings have _",
    "zonotopal_-dimensional vectors @xmath39 is the set @xmath40 it is also called the _ minkowski sum _ of vectors @xmath41 . in two dimensions , it is a @xmath42-gon .",
    "the link between vectors @xmath41 and the @xmath1-dimensional representation is specified in references @xcite and @xcite . ]",
    "note that they are dual to complete de bruijn grids .",
    "it should also be mentioned that such polygonal boundaries have a strong macroscopic influence on tilings , which results in a lower entropy than in free or periodic - boundary systems  @xcite .      in this section , we study the configuration space of partition - generated tilings that fill a given polygonal domain .    the codimension - one case has already been studied in detail  @xcite : the configuration space @xmath43 consists of all the integral coordinate points ( _ integral points _ ) lying into the convex polytope defined by the system of inequalities related to the partition problem .",
    "this configuration space is embedded into an euclidean space of dimension @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is the number of parts of the partition problem .",
    "two points are neighbors in @xmath43 ( i.e. they are linked by an edge of the underlying hypercubic lattice ) if they only differ by a local rearrangement of tiles which is usually called an ( elementary ) flip  @xcite ( see figure  [ flip ] ) .    in this section , all the latter properties",
    "are extended to generalized @xmath10 problems , in particular to partitions - on - tiling problems . in reference",
    "@xcite , the general @xmath9 case is treated .",
    "let us consider @xmath10 tilings which fill an octagonal region of sides @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "they are described by a class of partition problems on @xmath14 tilings inscribed in hexagons of sides @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these tilings will be indexed by an integer @xmath44 .",
    "they have exactly @xmath45 parts .",
    "therefore each configuration space @xmath46 related to the partition problem on @xmath44 is of dimension @xmath22 . now to describe the whole configuration space of the tiling problem",
    ", we need to make explicit how these different @xmath46 are connected to each other .",
    "firstly , we need to specify how a flip in the tiling representation is translated in the grid space .",
    "it is simply a 3-line flip , as illustrated in figure  [ flip ] .",
    "if the fourth family of lines has been singled out in the partitions - on - tiling process , two cases must be distinguished :    * either the 3-line flip does not involve any line from the fourth family .",
    "it means that the 3 vertices involved in the flip have the same interline index and that this index does not evolve during the flip .",
    "these vertices are therefore coded by parts of same value . on the other hand , the base tiling ( i.e. the tiling dual to the 3-family subgrid ) on which the partitions are defined undergoes a flip ; * or the flip involves a line @xmath47 of the fourth family . in this case",
    ", the 3-family subgrid is not modified through the flip .",
    "the same holds for the base tiling on which the partitions are defined . on the other hand ,",
    "let us consider the only vertex @xmath48 involved in the flip but which does not belong to @xmath47 . during the flip ,",
    "its interline index is increased by @xmath49 .",
    "therefore a part ( and only one ) of the partition problem varies ( by @xmath49 ) .    to sum up , a flip is translated either in a base tiling flip , without any modification of the parts ( type - i flip ) , or in a variation of one of the parts without any modification of the base ( type - ii flip ) .",
    "let us go back to the configuration space @xmath43 . since @xmath43 can be seen as a collection of spaces @xmath46 associated with tilings @xmath44 , it can be given a `` discrete fiber bundle '' structure , the base @xmath50 of which is the configuration space of ( base ) tilings @xmath44 .",
    "its fibers are the spaces @xmath46 .",
    "practically , suppose that @xmath50 is embedded in an hypercubic array of dimension @xmath51 and that the dimension of each fiber is @xmath22",
    ". then the whole space can be embedded in a lattice @xmath52 : the first @xmath51 coordinates code the base tilings @xmath44 and the @xmath22 last ones the parts on these tilings .",
    "we already know the structure of @xmath43 inside a fiber : an edge between two vertices corresponds to a type - ii flip .",
    "now , we must establish how a type - i flip connects two fibers .",
    "a type - i flip consists of a flip in the base tiling , transforming the tiling @xmath44 into @xmath53 , but which does not alter the values of the parts . in the fiber ,",
    "the @xmath22 coordinates of the corresponding points are therefore unchanged .",
    "but in the base @xmath50 , @xmath44 and @xmath53 are coded by two points which differ by only one of their @xmath51 coordinates .",
    "thus , in @xmath43 , the two tilings differ by only one coordinate : they are neighbors in @xmath54 .",
    "however , we have omitted to deal with a subtlety in the previous statement : so far , we have proven that two fibers are connected _ via _ a piece of hypercubic lattice .",
    "thus we have only proven the _ local _ hypercubic structure of the configuration space . to provide a complete proof",
    ", we need to exhibit an extrinsic set of hypercubic coordinates in which every configuration can be encoded and in which two neighbor tilings differ by a single flip . as a matter of fact",
    ", we only have to specify coordinates in fibers : the choice of coordinates in the base @xmath50 is an irrelevant question . as it was stated above ,",
    "a choice of coordinates is equivalent to the choice of a tile - labeling of a @xmath55 base tiling . now ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ coord.choice ] , such a tiling can be seen as a domino tiling on a triangular lattice : every tile is the union of an upward and a downward triangle .",
    "therefore any labeling of upward triangles will provide a tile - labeling and therefore a set of coordinates in each fiber .",
    "it is now clear that with such coordinates , a type - i flip corresponds to a bond of the hypercubic lattice .",
    "we can now derive the dimension of the hypercubic lattice in which @xmath43 is embedded : @xmath56 since the dimension of the base is @xmath57 and the dimension of fibers is @xmath58 .",
    "these arguments in the octagonal case can be extended by induction to the general @xmath9 problem  @xcite , at least as far as the local hypercubic structure is concerned ( see  [ cycles ] ) .",
    "note also that , following this work , this configuration space has been recently investigated further by m. latapy , who detailed the nature of its structure when it is seen as a partially ordered set  @xcite , in any @xmath11 case .",
    "briefly speaking , the lattice structure in the fibers looks like that of a plane partition configuration space ( it is a `` distributive lattice '' ) , whereas the structure of the whole set is a bit less rich ( it is a lattice , but not a distributive one ) .",
    "another interesting question concerns the connectivity of this configuration space : for a given boundary , is it possible to obtain a random tiling from any other one _ via _ a sequence of elementary flips ? in the @xmath11 case , the configuration space is connected for any @xmath1  @xcite . the present analysis provides another straightforward proof of this result : every fiber is connected as the configuration space of a partition problem on an acyclic directed graph since it is the convex union of normal simplices . moreover ,",
    "the base is connected for the same reason ( inductively ) , which completes the proof .",
    "the general case is discussed in  [ cycles ] .",
    "we first recall the results of references  @xcite about generalized partitions . the configuration space of a generalized @xmath22-part partition problem of height @xmath18 is embedded in a @xmath22-dimensional euclidean space , the coordinates @xmath25 of which are the parts of the problem .",
    "the configurations are coded by integral - coordinate points ( called integral points ) , which belong to the convex polytope @xmath59}$ ] defined by the intersection of the hypercube @xmath60 and of the cone @xmath61 defined by all the suitable relations between the parts .",
    "the key point is that this configuration space can be decomposed into elementary volumes , the so - called _",
    "normal simplices_. let @xmath62 be the orthonormal basis of the euclidean space which generates the @xmath63 lattice . a @xmath22-dimensional simplex of vertices @xmath64",
    "is said to be _ normal _ if there exists an integer @xmath65 such that :    * each @xmath66 is an integral point , * @xmath67 is parallel to a vector @xmath68 for any @xmath69 , * if @xmath70 then @xmath71 , * @xmath72 for any @xmath69 .    for short , we shall call such a simplex a _ normal simplex of side @xmath65_. its integral volume ( _ i.e. _ the number of integral points it contains ) can easily be derived : it is the binomial coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "but such simplices have lower - dimensional faces in common that contain integral points , which must not be double - counted .",
    "therefore we must take into account a subtle inclusion - exclusion scheme in order to count correctly the number of configurations . to sum up",
    ", one must suppress @xmath74 faces ( @xmath75 ) to some simplices in order to avoid double - counting . if @xmath76 is the number of simplices that lose @xmath74 faces ,",
    "then the number of configurations is @xmath77 where the maximum number of suppressed faces , @xmath78 , depends on the partition problem under study .    the so - called _ descent theorem _  @xcite provides a prescription to characterize the coefficients @xmath76 . to state this theorem , we need the following definition : with each simplex of the decomposition , we can associate the sequence @xmath79 of indices appearing in the definition of the normal simplex .",
    "then _ the number of descents _ in this sequence is the number of indices such that @xmath80 .",
    "the descent theorem states that , if there exists a zero - descent simplex , which is always true up to a re - indexing of the basis vectors ) .",
    "] , then a simplex with @xmath74 descents loses @xmath74 faces .",
    "therefore the coefficient @xmath76 in equation  [ decomp ] is equal to the number of simplices with @xmath74 descents .    as a corollary ,",
    "the number of normal simplices in the decomposition is equal to the sum of the coefficients @xmath76 of equation  [ decomp ] .",
    "these coefficients @xmath76 can be given a different equivalent interpretation  @xcite : one builds a directed graph , denoted by @xmath81 , with two extremal vertices , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "a simplex of the decomposition is put in one - to - one correspondence with _ maximal",
    "_ walks in @xmath81 ( _ i.e. _ going from @xmath82 to @xmath83 ) .",

    "therefore the link between the two configurations can be indexed by @xmath69 and the descent theorem can be translated in terms of these indices : the number of descents of a walk in the graph is defined as the number of descents of the sequence of indices of the bonds it follows .    to sum up , in the graph @xmath81 of any generalized partition problem",
    ", a step between a vertex and one of its neighbors in a maximal walk amounts to increasing one of the parts from 0 to 1 .",

    "the parts are attached to the tiles of the @xmath32 problem , as in figure  [ part.gen.42 ] .",
    "therefore , to each maximal walk in the graph @xmath81 , it corresponds a labelling of the tiles , which characterizes in which order the parts are increased by one in the walk .",
    "for example , figure  [ chemin31 ] ( left ) shows a tile labeling ( among many others ) in the partition problem of figure  [ partsur32 ] ( left ) .",
    "in fact , the only condition on those labelings is that when two tiles @xmath25 and @xmath87 are adjacent , if the order relation is @xmath88 , the label associated with @xmath25 is _ smaller _ that the label associated with @xmath87 ( @xmath25 is increased _ before _",

    "note that in the @xmath94 case as well as in the @xmath14 one , where exact enumeration formulas are known ( see reference  @xcite for a review , for instance ) , the asymptotic behavior of the finite - size corrections to the entropy can be derived  : they decrease like @xmath95 .",
    "fitting such a behavior with the numerical values , we get a limiting diagonal entropy close to @xmath96 .",
    "the precision of this entropy can not be refined beyond the second digit with the small amount of values we have got .",
    "previous entropy calculations _ via _ transfer - matrix methods where derived concerning octagonal tilings , but in the case of periodic or free boundary conditions  @xcite , leading to a limiting value @xmath97 .",

    "among the large class of random tilings , this paper is devoted to fixed boundary codimension - two tilings of rhombi ( `` octagonal tilings '' ) .",
    "we have established combinatorial properties of the configurational spaces of such tilings , extending results previously derived in the more restricted case of codimension - one tilings .",
    "octagonal tilings are more closely related to real quasicrystals than are codimension - one tilings .",
    "moreover , many of the results presented here can ( at least partially ) be extended to two - dimensional tilings of rhombi of any codimension , and even to any - dimensional tilings .",
    "the present analysis provides additive formulas which simplify significantly the enumeration of finite - size tilings . in a geometrical viewpoint ,",
    "these formulas come from a decomposition of the configuration space into elementary volumes , called normal simplices .",
    "the number of configurations in each of these simplices is known .",

    "we wish to express our gratitude to mike widom , matthieu latapy and vic reiner for fruitful discussions and helpful comments .",

    "all the parts are of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are respectively equal to 0 and 1 .",
    "such a walk is denoted by a sequence @xmath99 .",
    "we use again the grid representation of tilings and the formalism introduced in section  [ gen.parts ] : the partition problem on @xmath98 is seen as a partition problem on the vertices of the corresponding grid ( which has @xmath27 families ) , @xmath100 , called the subgrid of the problem .",
    "the vertices of @xmath100 are ordered on each de bruijn family .",
    "a partition @xmath101 of height @xmath84 consists of marking each vertex of @xmath100 by a 0 or a 1 .",
    "the vertices marked with a 0 and those marked with a 1 are separated by the only de bruijn line of the @xmath1-th family of the original grid .",
    "this latter line is denoted by @xmath102 .",

    "the section of the subgrid @xmath100 by @xmath102 is precisely of this type . indeed ,",
    "if we identify the intersection of a de bruijn line of the @xmath105-th family and @xmath102 with a @xmath69-tile , this latter section is a sequence of tiles , @xmath105 of each family @xmath69 , that is to say a @xmath104 tiling .",
    "therefore the sequence @xmath106 is coded by a sequence @xmath107 of such tilings , as illustrated in figure  [ ex31_32 ] .",
    "since the same argument can be applied to any subgrid @xmath100 of this @xmath9 problem , all the walks counted by the sum of the coefficients @xmath76 of the counting polynomial can be seen as such sequences @xmath107 .",
    "it is now rather clear that all the configurations @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the same for the partition problems on all subgrids @xmath100 : they are the two configurations where all the tiles of a same family are adjacent and where the families are ordered according to the grid configuration at infinity , which does not depend on @xmath100 , but only on the vectors @xmath12 .",
    "these two configurations will be denoted by @xmath110 and @xmath111 , as in figure  [ ex31_32 ] . likewise",
    ", two successive tilings of a sequence , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , only differ by a tile flip , that is the exchange of two adjacent tiles , since the two successive sections `` surround '' a single vertex of @xmath100 .",
    "and there is a natural order between two successive such tilings : considering how tiles are ordered on @xmath110 and @xmath111 , it is clear which tiling should come first in the sequence .",
    "conversely , let us establish that such a sequence @xmath107 of @xmath114 tilings , going from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , and where two successive tilings only differ by a single flip and respect the above order , contributes towards the sum of the coefficients @xmath76 of a unique partition problem on a @xmath31 membrane   and therefore towards the sum of the coefficients @xmath76 of the global @xmath11 problem .",
    "the proof is rather straightforward and is also illustrated in figure  [ ex31_32 ] : considering two successive tilings , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the two dots that represent the two flipping tiles of different families are joined by two crossing segments ; the so - obtained vertex is labelled by @xmath115 ; all the other tiles are joined by horizontal segments",
    ". then one reconstructs a complete @xmath116 grid , the vertices of which are labeled by numbers increasing on each de bruijn line .",
    "this is precisely the kind of object counted by coefficients @xmath76 .",
    "note that all the walks counted by @xmath117 have the same length , since all the subgrids @xmath100 have the same number of intersections .",
    "in this section , we derive the number @xmath119 of walks @xmath120 in the @xmath118 configuration space .",
    "note that for sake of simplicity , we note @xmath121 instead of @xmath27",
    ". we shall prove that : @xmath122 where @xmath123 when @xmath124 .",
    "we give two proofs : a purely algebraic one in the general case , using results by stanley  @xcite , and a combinatorial one  @xcite .",
    "note that the case where all the parameters @xmath105 are equal to 1 was already treated by stanley  @xcite , and that edelman and greene derived a nice combinatorial proof in this case  @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the notions of young tableaux and standard young tableaux are known ( left ) , with the only constraint that the number of boxes in columns decreases from left to right .",
    "the shape of the tableau is the decreasing sequence of the column heights .",
    "a standard young tableau of a given shape is simply a numbering of the cells of the tableau by integral numbers , running from 1 to the number of cells and increasing in rows and columns .",
    "figure  [ young ] provides examples . for a presentation in relation with the symmetric groups @xmath125 , the reader can refer to @xcite . ] .",
    "but before all , we need to introduce the relation between the tilings considered in this paper and a class of computer science objects , the so - called _ sorting algorithms_. this analogy will help the presentation of the algebraic proof and will be useful in the combinatorial proof .      in the sorting language , a _ comparator _ @xmath126 $ ] acts on a list @xmath127 of numbers as follows : @xmath25 and @xmath87 are respectively replaced by @xmath128 and @xmath129 . following knuth @xcite",
    ", we call a _ complete _ sorting algorithm a sequence of such comparators which sorts in the increasing order any list of real numbers @xmath130 . this sorting algorithm will be called _ primitive _ if each comparator can be written @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "we also suppose that this algorithm is not redundant , that is to say it does not contain any comparator @xmath132 $ ] that could be suppressed because previous comparators already insure that @xmath133 .",
    "knuth shows that a sequence of comparators is a sorting algorithm if it correctly sorts the completely reversed list @xmath134 .",
    "this means that a complete primitive sorting algorithm is a sequence of comparators @xmath131 $ ] that transforms the list @xmath134 into the list @xmath135 .",
    "such an algorithm can have a diagrammatical representation as follows : the @xmath121 variables @xmath25 are represented by @xmath121 horizontal lines .",
    "each comparator @xmath131 $ ] is represented by a crossing    c    between lines @xmath69 and @xmath115 .",
    "figure  [ sort ] illustrates this construction .",
    "a continuous line follows a number during the sorting process .",
    "for example , the greatest number is on the top at the beginning and in the bottom at the end . since every number must be compared to every other one , and since there is no redundancy , there are @xmath136 crossings .",
    "we are now able to establish the link between those algorithms and @xmath137 tilings , more precisely with their de bruijn representation . indeed ,",
    "the analogy between the diagram of figure  [ sort ] and a de bruijn grid with one line per family is straightforward : each continuous line of the diagram represents a de bruijn line and crosses exactly once every other line .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between both systems : different sorting algorithms can represent the same de bruijn grid since only the crossing topology is meaningful .",
    "for example , in figure  [ sort ] , the fourth and the fifth comparator ( _ i.e. _ [ 4,5 ] and [ 2,3 ] ) are applied in this order ( these comparator are circled in the figure ) .",
    "if they were applied in the reverse ordre , the algorithm would be different whereas the de bruijn grid would be the same .",
    "therefore we are led to define equivalence classes of sorting algorithms @xcite .",
    "we say that two comparators @xmath131 $ ] and @xmath138 $ ] commute if @xmath139 .",
    "two algorithms are equivalent if they differ by a finite number a comparator commutations",
    ". these equivalence classes of @xmath121-element sorting algorithms are in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath121-family grids with one line per family , and therefore with tilings inscribed in polygons of side 1 . the number @xmath140 of equivalent classes has been computed by stanley  @xcite ( see also edelman and greene  @xcite ) and is given by equation  [ super - hips ] in the case where @xmath141 for all @xmath69 : @xmath142    we need to generalize this point of view to systems with more than one line per de bruijn family , which leads to the definition of _ partial _ sorting algorithms . these algorithms are related to pre - sorted lists of numbers . indeed , let us suppose that we have @xmath121 families of @xmath105 numbers each ( @xmath143 ) , and that in each family , the numbers are already pre - sorted in the increasing order",
    ". then we are interested in the algorithms which order the whole set of these numbers in the increasing order .",
    "we call them partial sorting algorithms .",
    "the ideas are essentially the same as in the previous case , except that , since the numbers of a given family are already ordered , the corresponding lines do not need to cross .",
    "the corresponding diagram is similar to a de bruijn grid with @xmath121 families of lines , @xmath105 lines in each family .",
    "the tilings are equivalence classes of such algorithms .",
    "they are inscribed in polygons of sides @xmath144 .    in the partial sorting case",
    ", the reference list to be reversed is not @xmath134 any longer but a list @xmath145 were some elements are already sorted . if @xmath146 , then @xmath147 there are @xmath121 pre - sorted blocks of @xmath105 elements each .",
    "an example is provided in figure  [ diagram.partial ] .",
    "note also that a sorting algorithm can be seen as an ordering ( or a labeling ) of the comparators of the corresponding equivalence class , since the comparators come in a natural order : the labels are increasing on each de bruijn line , from left to right . as a consequence ,",
    "sorting algorithms are in one - to - one correspondence with labeling of tilings , as defined in section  [ decomp.simp ] or  [ somme.des.aj.gen ] .",
    "this point is striking when comparing figures  [ ex31_32 ] and [ diagram.partial ] .",
    "therefore the sums of the coefficients @xmath76 of a @xmath11 problem is equal to the number of partial sorting algorithms of the suitable pre - sorted @xmath27 families of variables .",
    "this point will be helpful in the following section .",
    "the main result used in this section is a theorem by stanley ( theorem 4.1 of reference  @xcite , and its corollary 4.2 ) .",
    "we first need to expose these results and to translate them in terms of our notations and definitions .",
    "it is the object of the first paragraph .",
    "then , using the above equivalence between coefficients @xmath76 and partial sorts , we shall apply stanley s theorem to the case of interest here , and derive relation  [ super - hips ] .",
    "the symmetric group @xmath125 of permutations on @xmath121 elements is generated by the transpositions @xmath148 : any permutation @xmath149 can be decomposed in products of transpositions .",
    "a decomposition is said to be _ minimal _ if , using the relations between the generators @xmath150 : @xmath151 it can not be simplified into a shortest decomposition ; then all the reduced decomposition of @xmath149 have the same length , denoted by @xmath152 . if @xmath153 , we define @xmath154 then @xmath155 is the sequence obtained by arranging the numbers @xmath156 in descending order ( and ignoring any 0 s ) ; @xmath157 is the _ conjugate _ to the sequence obtained by arranging the numbers @xmath158 in descending order .",
    "stanley  @xcite states that : _ if @xmath159 , then the number of reduced decompositions of @xmath149 is equal to the number @xmath160 of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath155 . _      we still denote by @xmath145 the permutation as defined in the previous section .",
    "the idea is to see each comparator @xmath131 $ ] as a generator @xmath148 of a reduced decomposition and to identify a sorting algorithm with a reduced decomposition of @xmath145 .",
    "more precisely , the set of comparators can be seen as the generators of a group , and they obey the same relations as the @xmath150 : they satisfy relations  [ relations ] , and @xmath131 $ ] and @xmath138 $ ] commute if @xmath139 . finally , the non - redundant character of sorts is equivalent to the reduced character of decompositions . as a consequence ,",
    "the number @xmath119 of partial sorts is equal to the number of reduced decompositions of @xmath145 .",
    "now , in order to apply stanley s statement , we must compute the quantities @xmath161 and @xmath162 , as defined in reference  @xcite : in the present case , one gets @xmath163 @xmath164 thus @xmath165 and stanley s theorem applies .",
    "the young tableau of shape @xmath161 is represented in figure  [ blocs ] .",
    "such a tableau will be called a _ block tableau _ of size @xmath166 in the following .",
    "the number @xmath167 of reduced decompositions of @xmath145 is equal to the number @xmath168 of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath161 .",
    "this number can be derived from young s _ hook - length formula _",
    "@xcite : given a shape @xmath169 , the _ hook _ associated with a given cell @xmath170 of the tableau is the set of cells above and at the right of @xmath170 , including @xmath170 itself ( figure  [ young ] ) . it is denoted by @xmath171 . the _ hook length _",
    "@xmath172 is the number of cells in @xmath171 .",
    "then the number @xmath173 of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath169 is : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the total number of cells and the product runs over all cells .",
    "this hook - length formula can know be applied to the above tableau : the hook - length of the cell in the upper right corner of block @xmath176 is @xmath177 , from which one deduces all the hook - lengths on the block and their product : @xmath178 .",
    "moreover , @xmath179 , from which equation  [ super - hips ] follows .      in this section , we provide a combinatorial bijective proof of the previous result  @xcite .",
    "this proof follows the same scheme as the proof by edelman and greene  @xcite in the case where all the parameters @xmath105 are equal to 1 . we need first to introduce the notion of _ balanced tableaux",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we consider a young tableau , together with a labeling of its cells , running from 1 to the number of cells , @xmath22 .",
    "note that now this tableau is not necessarily standard , that is to say the labels are not necessarily ordered in each row and in each column .",
    "given a cell @xmath170 and its hook @xmath171 , we define the _ hook rank _ @xmath180 of @xmath170 as the number of cells of @xmath171 whose labels are smaller or equal to the label of @xmath170 .",
    "we also define the _ hook height _ @xmath181 as the number of cells above @xmath170 ( including @xmath170 itself ) .",
    "the tableau is said to be balanced if for all cells @xmath170 , @xmath182 ( see figure  [ young ] ) .    at last , a tableau of shape @xmath183 ( figure  [ young ] , right ) will be called a _ stair tableau _ ( of order @xmath121 ) .",
    "note that a stair tableau is a particular case of block tableau , as defined in the previous section .",
    "in the case @xmath141 , the situation is as follows : edelman and greene build a bijection between _ complete _ sorting algorithms on @xmath121 elements and balanced block tableaux of order @xmath121 and then a bijection between those balanced tableaux and standard tableaux of order @xmath121 , which are then enumerated _ via _ the hook - length formula . in the following , we use and generalize these results to the case of partial sorts .",
    "in fact , in reference  @xcite , the authors also establish the bijection between balanced tableaux of any shape and standard tableaux of the same shape .",
    "as a consequence , we only need to generalize the first bijection between _ partial _ sorting algorithms on @xmath121 families containing @xmath105 elements each and balanced block tableaux of size @xmath184 , as in figure  [ blocs ] . once this correspondence is established , the rest of the proof is based upon the hook - length formula , as in the previous algebraic proof .",
    "the rest of the section is devoted to this correspondence .    to begin with ,",
    "let us consider a _",
    "complete _ sorting algorithm on @xmath121 lines : it is a sequence of crossings between de bruijn lines .",
    "these crossings are labeled by integers running from 1 to @xmath185 , from left to right . following edelman and greene , the intersection label of two lines indexed by @xmath186 and @xmath187",
    "is denoted by @xmath188 . in the stair tableau ,",
    "this number is written in the cell situated on the @xmath186-th column and on the @xmath189-th line ( starting from the bottom ) : in figure  [ young ] ( right ) , the so - obtained tableau corresponding to the complete sorting algorithm of figure  [ sort ] is represented .",
    "then it can be proven  @xcite that this tableau is balanced and more precisely that this construction establishes a bijection between both classes of objects .",
    "let us now focus on partial sorting algorithms .",
    "since there are couples of de bruijn lines which do not intersect , it is rather natural to consider block tableaux , which are stair tableaux where some cells are missing .",
    "more precisely , we will consider partial sorting algorithms and block tableaux as _ amputated _ complete sorting algorithms and _ amputated _ stair tableaux , respectively .",
    "the idea is to define _ canonical _ amputations in order to preserve edelman and greene s bijection between amputated objects , as discussed below .",
    "figure  [ amput.tab ] illustrates the tableau amputation process : given @xmath121 integers @xmath144 and a stair tableau of order @xmath190 , @xmath121 small stair tableaux of order @xmath105 are removed from the large one in order to get a block tableau of size @xmath184 .",
    "as far as the amputation of sorting algorithms is concerned , we first need to define _ canonical _ complete sorts : the simplest way to characterize them is by their corresponding stair tableaux , the cells of which are increasing from left to right and from bottom to top , as illustrated in figure  [ canon ] .",
    "they are usually referred as `` bubble - sorts '' in the literature .",
    "if we consider now a partial sorting algorithm with @xmath105 elements in each family , it can be canonically transformed into a complete sort : we simply add @xmath121 canonical complete sorts on @xmath105 elements at its end , as in figure  [ amput.tri ] .",
    "these sorts appear in the order of their indices @xmath69 .",
    "the so - obtained sort is very particular since it ends with @xmath121 canonical sorts .",
    "therefore it will be called a _ sequential _ complete sort of order @xmath184 . by construction",
    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between sequential complete sorts of order @xmath184 and partial sorts of the same size .",
    "let us now characterize the structure of the young tableau @xmath191 associated with such a sequential sort .",
    "the @xmath192 last intersections in the sort are those appearing in the @xmath121 canonical complete sorts .",
    "it is easily checked that the corresponding labels in the large stair tableau appear in the @xmath121 small canonical stair tableaux involved in the amputation process . as a consequence ,",
    "the labels of the amputated tableau run from 1 to @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is its number of cells .",
    "these labels code the @xmath22 intersections of the partial sort remaining of the original sequential complete sorting algorithm .    to sum up , as it is illustrated in figure  [ bij ] ,",
    "starting from partial sorts , we biunivocally construct complete sequential sorts , then balanced tableaux , the @xmath22 last labels of which are situated in the @xmath121 stair sub - tableaux .",
    "when these sub - tableaux are removed from the large one , we obtain a class of block tableaux of size @xmath184 , which will be called _ pre - balanced",
    "_ tableaux .",
    "remember now that are goal is to establish a bijection between partial sorts and balanced block tableaux .",
    "thus we need to construct a bijection ( denoted by @xmath193 in figure  [ bij ] ) between those pre - balanced tableaux of size @xmath184 and balanced block tableaux of the same size .",
    "* bijection @xmath193 : * actually , @xmath193 is an involution : in each group of @xmath105 columns , it inverses the order of columns ; for example , the first column becomes the @xmath35-th one , the second one becomes the @xmath194-th one and so on .",
    "likewise , the @xmath195-th column becomes the @xmath196-th one .",
    "there is a rather deep reason for such a column permutation : the @xmath121 canonical complete sorts added at the end of a partial sort in order to make it complete also reverse the order of lines in each group of @xmath105 lines .",
    "the role of @xmath193 is to keep track of this fact .",
    "it is now a rather technical task to prove that @xmath193 provides balanced tableaux and that it is a bijective map .",
    "we shall temporarily admit the following results which will be proven at the end of this section : in a pre - balanced tableau , in each block @xmath197 , the labels are decreasing in each line and column ( from bottom to top ) ; in a balanced block tableau , they are increasing in lines and decreasing in columns in such a block .    consider a pre - balanced block tableau and in this tableau a hook @xmath171 associated with the cell @xmath170 situated in the block @xmath197 , and in this block in the line @xmath198 ( from bottom to top ) and column @xmath199 ( @xmath200 and @xmath201 ) .",
    "this hook comes from a larger one , @xmath202 , in the stair tableau which has been amputated . in the process",
    "the hook has lost @xmath203 cells , @xmath204 on its right and @xmath205 on its top ( see figure  [ hh ] ) .",
    "thus the height of @xmath171 is equal to @xmath206 on the other hand , all the lost cells , coming from the @xmath121 removed stair tableaux , had labels larger than the label of the cell @xmath170 . as a consequence , the hook rank remains unchanged : @xmath207       now , @xmath193 permutes the labels of the block tableau but does not change its shape . in the process , the cell @xmath170 receives the label of the cell @xmath208 still situated in the line @xmath198 , but in the column @xmath209 .    for a given quantity @xmath210 assigned to each cell ,",
    "we denote by @xmath211 the value of this quantity for the cell @xmath208 in the pre - balanced tableau , and @xmath212 its value in its image by @xmath193 . in particular , @xmath213 , and we have just proven that @xmath214 .",
    "moreover , @xmath215 . indeed , by @xmath193 , the hook @xmath171 receives the labels of the hook @xmath216 outside the block @xmath197 ; and in the block , the labels , which were decreasing in the line @xmath198 of the pre - balanced tableau , are increasing in its image by @xmath193 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath217 now @xmath218 by definition",
    ". therefore @xmath219 and the tableau is balanced .",
    "conversely , given a balanced tableau , since the labels are increasing in each line of each block , one proves that its image by the involution @xmath193 is pre - balanced .",
    "we have established the bijection .",
    "we need to prove the two above assertions about the order of labels in blocks of balanced and pre - balanced tableaux .",
    "we only give sketches of the proofs .",
    "as far as pre - balanced tableaux are concerned , the proof is rather straightforward : a block @xmath197 contains labels associated with all the intersections of two families of lines .",
    "if those lines are isolated from the rest of the tiling , it becomes clear that the order in which intersections occur is constrained .",
    "for balanced tableau , the proof is more complex .",
    "the basic idea is to construct a proof by `` planar induction '' : we prove that if a suitable @xmath220 property is true for cells above and at the right of a given cell @xmath170 , then it is also true for @xmath170",
    ". then if @xmath220 is true for cells on the upper right corners of the tableau , it will be true for every cell . in the present case ,",
    "if @xmath221 still denotes the label of the cell @xmath170 , then the property reads :    _ @xmath222 : in the block @xmath197 to which @xmath170 belongs , the cells above @xmath170 have labels smaller than @xmath221 , while the cells at its right have labels greater than @xmath221 . _",
    "a proper use of the balanced character of a block tableau proves that it satisfies the above planar induction principle .",
    "in this appendix , we only give sketches of proofs for the results used in section  [ results ] .",
    "the complete proofs can be found in the relevant references .      in order to prove relations  [ elnit1 ] and [ a7 ]",
    ", we need , in the octagonal case , a slightly different representation of de bruijn grids than those presented in the introductory section : as displayed in figure  [ sq.grids ] , the lines of the two first families form a square lattice ( of sides @xmath223 and @xmath65 in this case ) , on which the lines of the third and fourth de bruijn families run : they are represented by directed walks on the lattice , going from one corner to the diagonally opposite one . according to whether the two sides of length one are adjacent or",
    "not , the two paths have the same starting and ending points ( right ) or not ( left ) . in this representation",
    ", the de bruijn line intersections must be distinguished to avoid possible ambiguities due to path tangency ( it will be called the _ distinguished _ vertex in the following ) . for example , the octagonal tilings of figure  [ ex42 ] are represented by the pair of paths of figure  [ sq.grids ] .",
    "the proof of relation  [ elnit1 ] is now straightforward : if @xmath224 are the coordinates of the distinguished vertex in the grid , then the number of configurations is the product of the 4 number of choices for the four pieces of paths going from @xmath224 to the four corners , that is the product of four binomial coefficients .",
    "now summing over all @xmath224 configurations one gets relation  [ elnit1 ] .",
    "the proof of relation  [ a7 ] is a little more complex and involves some modifications of the pair of paths , as usual in this kind of calculation .",
    "the idea is to exchange the two paths _ after _ the distinguished vertex , in order to get non - crossing ( but possibly touching ) paths , and then to shift some parts of those paths in order to get a non - touching pair .",
    "the latter pairs can be counted with help of the determinental gessel - viennot method  @xcite .",
    "the interested reader will refer to reference  @xcite for more details .",
    "let us now focus on the recursion relation  [ brock ] .",
    "we use again the lattice - path representation , as defined in the previous section . given a pair @xmath18 of crossing paths , with no _ a priori _ distinguished vertex , let us denote by @xmath225 the length of their intersection ( see figure  [ brock.proof ] ) .",
    "note that this intersection can be a point ( @xmath226 ) , a horizontal or a vertical segment ( of length @xmath225 ) .",
    "if @xmath227 is the set of pairs , then @xmath228 since there are @xmath229 possible choices for the distinguished vertex and there are @xmath230 such pairs of paths .       in the case where @xmath231 , if the distinguished vertex is not the point with the highest coordinates ( @xmath225 possibilities ) , as in figure  [ brock.proof ] , then a vertical or horizontal strip of the square lattice can be removed without changing the nature of the diagram : it is the strip of width 1 , at the right of ( respectively above ) the distinguished vertex if the intersection is horizontal ( respectively vertical ) . as a result ,",
    "one still have a square lattice ( but one of its side lengths is lowered by 1 ) with a pair of paths ( but the length of their intersection has been lowered by one in the process ) .",
    "that is why @xmath232 in conclusion , @xmath233 which achieves the proof .",
    "in this last appendix , we discuss what we know and what we do not know about the general @xmath9 case which was more widely studied in reference  @xcite .",
    "the different points and results tackled in the present paper are discussed .",
    "it will become clear that the possible existence of cycles in the partition - on - tiling problems is the major obstacle to simple generalizations .      as far as partitions on tilings are concerned , all that as been said in the octagonal case can be transposed to the general case : a fixed boundary @xmath9 tiling  @xcite can be coded in a single way as a partition on a @xmath32 tiling .",
    "the de bruijn lines are still defined as lines joining together the middles of opposite faces of rhombic tiles , and the parts of those partitions are still increasing along such lines .",
    "the reader can refer to bailey  @xcite for a more formal treatment of this question .",
    "note that in this case , there also exist de bruijn families of _ hyper - surfaces _ , associated with an edge orientation .",
    "however , as it was suggested in reference  @xcite , the geometry of configuration spaces might be more complex beyond the octagonal case .",
    "indeed , among the order relations @xmath24 between the parts of a partition - on - tiling problem , nothing forbids _ a priori _ the existence of cycles of inequalities , such as @xmath234 , which enforces all these variables to be equal .",
    "at least two examples of @xmath235 tilings ( in relation with @xmath236 tiling problems ) are known which display such cycles . the first one can be found in reference @xcite ( example 10.4.1 ) and the second one in @xcite ( example 3.5 ) . in these examples ,",
    "the tilings are defined by their dual de bruijn grids   which are families of 2-dimensional de bruijn surfaces in a 3-dimensional space   together with an orientation of de bruijn lines .",
    "when such a cycle exists , all the parts of the cycle have a `` collective behavior '' , which is not compatible with the previous description : they behave like a single _ effective _ part .",
    "in particular , the number of effective parts in this partition problem , denoted as @xmath237 , is strictly smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "thus the counting polynomial of this partition problem becomes : @xmath238 the counting polynomial of the whole tiling problem is a sum of such polynomials , with possibly many different @xmath237 .",
    "moreover , the existence of cycles invalidates the proof of the connectivity of the configuration space ( section  [ config.space ] ) .",
    "as far as we know , this point is an open question in the general @xmath239 case .",
    "note however that whenever one can prove that order relations on fibers contain no cycles , then the configuration space is connected .",
    "we prove that the existence of cycles does not alter the previous results about the sums of coefficients @xmath76 and walks in configuration spaces , provided these objects are suitably defined : if we focus only on coefficients @xmath240 associated with configuration spaces of effective dimension @xmath22 ( and not @xmath241 ) , then the sum @xmath242 of these coefficients is equal to",
    "the number of maximal walks in the corresponding @xmath243 configuration space .",
    "note that this quantity @xmath242 still characterizes the leading coefficient of the counting polynomial ( of degree @xmath22 ) as @xmath18 goes to infinity .",
    "more precisely , if there exists a cycle in the partition problem on a membrane , we have just seen that the coefficients @xmath244 of this problem do not contribute to @xmath242 . on the other hand ,",
    "let us consider a step in a walk in the @xmath243 configuration space : we have seen that the part @xmath245 which differentiates the two consecutive configurations of this step is such that all parts lesser ( resp .",
    "greater ) than @xmath245 in the graph are equal to 1 ( resp . 0 ) .",
    "this part is equal to 0 in a partition and to 1 in the other one .",
    "as far as the parts of the cycle are concerned , since they are all equal , they can not but jump from 0 to 1 all together , which is not conform to our definition of walk in the configuration space , in terms of _ single _ elementary flips . conversely and for similar reasons , a maximal walk in the configuration space can not give a membrane with cycles .    in conclusion ,",
    "as well @xmath242 as the number of walks are not concerned by partitions with cycles , and the above result remains valid .    before going on , let us specify what the extremal tilings become in larger dimension : @xmath110 and @xmath111 are defined by partitions where all the parts are equal to 0 and 1 , respectively . therefore the corresponding tilings present a faceted aspect , as on figure  [ macle ] . note that among the different possible faceted tilings , the two extremal ones depend on how the @xmath1-th de bruijn family of surfaces is chosen .",
    "at last , we recall that there can not exist a descent theorem as simple as the octagonal one in the general case .",
    "indeed , its derivation is closely related to the existence of a zero - descent simplex in each partition - on - tiling problem , that is to the @xmath22-dimensional character of the associated configuration space .",
    "but we have shown that this point is not granted in general , since there can exist partition - on - tiling problems for which the configuration space has a dimension @xmath237 smaller than @xmath22 .",
