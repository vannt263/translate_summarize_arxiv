    "scaling relations between observable properties and total gravitating mass are a critical ingredient for cosmological tests based on galaxy clusters ( for a review , see @xcite ) . for tests using the abundance , clustering and growth of clusters ,",
    "scaling relations provide essential mass proxies and are fundamentally important in accounting for selection biases .",
    "our knowledge of these relations and the systematics that affect them currently limits the achievable constraints on some cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "measurements of cluster gas mass fractions , which constrain the mean matter density cosmic expansion history ( e.g. @xcite ) , can also be expressed in terms of a scaling relation , namely gas mass as a function of total mass .",
    "in addition , the scaling relations are of considerable astrophysical interest , reflecting the complex response of the baryonic components of these systems to their overall gravitational potentials , environments and formation histories . for example , departures from the self - similar form introduced by @xcite provide clues to non - gravitational processes at work in clusters ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in previous work ,",
    "we have emphasized the need to model covariance between measured quantities in the analysis of cluster scaling relations @xcite .",
    "here , we distinguish further between various contributing factors to such covariance :    1 .   covariance that is intrinsic to the measurement process . for example",
    ", when multiple quantities are measured from an x - ray observation , poisson uncertainties due to photon counting affect these quantities in a coherent rather than independent way .",
    "covariance due to explicit use of one measurement to inform another .",
    "for example , if the compton @xmath0 signal from a sunyaev - zeldovich observation is measured within a radius determined from an x - ray observation , the statistical error in the radius determination coherently affects the errors on @xmath0 and on any x - ray quantities measured within that radius .",
    "covariance that is introduced by models that are fitted to the cluster data .",
    "the first concern above is straightforwardly addressed by jointly fitting or measuring all quantities of interest from the observations , and propagating the measurement errors using monte carlo sampling .",
    "the distribution of the resulting samples automatically contains all the information about the measurement covariance .    unlike the first , the second and third issues results from decisions on the part of the observer . for",
    "the second issue noted above , the use of monte carlo sampling to handle the error propagation can again allow the measurement covariance to be straightforwardly understood .    in this paper , we are concerned with the third issue identified above , in particular as it applies to mass measurements of galaxy clusters based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) , and scaling relations that are formed with such masses .",
    "we argue below that some widely employed procedures used to model cluster data introduce strong priors that can influence the resulting scaling relation constraints , and thus hamper our ability to perform robust astrophysical and cosmological measurements .",
    "fortunately , there are simple , alternative approaches that do not suffer from these problems , which are also discussed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] provides a brief introduction to galaxy cluster mass measurements , scaling relations and the self - similar model . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we discuss the various methods for estimating hydrostatic masses that have been proposed , with particular emphasis on the priors that each methods imposes on both masses and the resulting scaling relations . in section  [ sec : meta ] , we review and discuss results on the mass  temperature relation slope from the literature , with attention to the impact of these modeling priors .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "many galaxy cluster mass estimates in the literature are based on x - ray observations .",
    "x - ray data provide two observables that scale physically with total mass , namely the luminosity in the observed energy band and the temperature of the x - ray emitting , hot intracluster medium ( icm ) . under the assumption of spherical symmetry , spectral and surface brightness data measured in projection",
    "can be de - projected , yielding three - dimensional profiles of emissivity and temperature .",
    "these two can be combined to infer the icm density profile , ) , low - redshift clusters , and luminosity measured in the soft x - ray band ( e.g. 0.52.0@xmath1 ) , this conversion is essentially independent of temperature . ] and thus the gas mass , as well as the bolometric luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for clusters that are approximately spherical and close to hse",
    ", such data can also be used to constrain the total mass profile . specifically , hse implies a relationship between the density and temperature profiles of the icm , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the total mass , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath6 is newton s constant , and @xmath7 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "conventionally , scaling relations are formed by relating the observables of interest to the total mass , @xmath8 , within a particular radius , @xmath9 , jointly defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the critical density of the universe at the cluster s redshift .",
    "typical choices for @xmath12 range from 2500 ( intermediate radius ) to 200 ( approximately the virial radius ) . combining these equations ,",
    "one can immediately write @xmath13^{-1 } \\left[\\frac{k}{\\mu{{\\ensuremath{m_{\\mathrm{p}}}}}g}\\right ] t(r_\\delta ) \\ , \\mathcal{f}(r_\\delta ) , \\\\",
    "m_\\delta & = & \\left[\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\delta{{\\ensuremath{\\rho_{\\mathrm{c}}}}}(z)\\right]^{-1/2 } \\left[\\frac{k}{\\mu{{\\ensuremath{m_{\\mathrm{p}}}}}g}\\right]^{3/2 } t(r_\\delta)^{3/2 } \\ , \\mathcal{f}(r_\\delta)^{3/2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14    clusters forming from idealized , spherical gravitational collapse with no additional heating or cooling are expected to have self - similar ( i.e. described by the same function of @xmath15 for every cluster ) gas and dark matter density profiles . assuming hse , the temperature profiles of clusters will also have a self - similar shape ( though not a common normalization ) .",
    "this case was studied by @xcite , who derived power - law predictions for scaling relations using masses defined by equation  [ eq : radius ] : are written in terms of @xmath16 , the normalized hubble parameter . ]",

    "@xmath19 is the integrated , intrinsic sunyaev - zeldovich signal ( i.e. the thermal energy of the gas ) , and @xmath20 refers to the bremsstrahlung luminosity of the plasma ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "@xmath22 may be the temperature at radius @xmath9 or some weighted average of @xmath3 within @xmath9 , since the scalings are identical given self similarity [ @xmath23 is constant ] .    for simplicity",
    ", we will henceforth eliminate most of the constants , setting @xmath24 in practice , the redshift dependence represented by @xmath11 must be properly accounted for ; however , it is incidental to the focus of this work . by eliminating these terms ,",
    "we effectively consider the simplified case of scaling relations at a single redshift and fixed density contrast .      as an example",
    ", we consider the isothermal @xmath25 model .",
    "this case is deliberately simplistic ( indeed , the results below are well known ) , but it serves to illustrate some features of hse mass estimation using parametrized models that are relevant to our discussion in section  [ sec : methods ] .    in this model",
    ", the three - dimensional gas density and temperature profiles are parametrized by @xmath26 the gas mass is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "applying the hydrostatic equation , the mass profile is @xmath29 which yields a solution for the characteristic radius , @xmath30 from this , we can write the relationship between temperature and mass for clusters described by this model , @xmath31    in the self - similar case , all clusters have the same values of @xmath25 and @xmath32 , and so the self - similar scaling @xmath33 follows directly from equation  [ eq : betatm ] . furthermore , the hypergeometric function in @xmath34 ( equation  [ eq : betamgas ] ) assumes a constant value , leading to a constant gas mass fraction , and the other scaling laws in equation  [ eq : selfsimilar ] follow straightforwardly : @xmath35    conversely , departures from self - similarity result in changes to these scaling laws . for example , consider the case in which @xmath32 remains constant , but @xmath25 varies from cluster to cluster .",
    "the expectation value of the characteristic mass at fixed temperature can be written as @xmath36^{3/2 } , \\nonumber\\\\    & = & { \\ensuremath{\\left\\langle \\left.\\beta^{3/2 } \\right| t_0 \\right\\rangle } } \\left[\\frac{3t_0}{1+\\left({{\\ensuremath{r_{\\mathrm{c}}}}}/r_\\delta\\right)^2}\\right]^{3/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the distribution of @xmath25 values for clusters with temperature @xmath38 .",
    "thus , if @xmath25 varies systematically with temperature as @xmath39 , then the @xmath40@xmath41 slope implied by this model is modified to @xmath42 ( figure  [ fig : simple ] ) . the generalization when both @xmath25 and @xmath32 vary is straightforward , and the effect on the other scaling laws",
    "can be derived similarly .",
    "when deriving hydrostatic cluster masses , a common practice is to fit parametric functions for the three - dimensional gas density and temperature profiles to the observed surface brightness and temperature data , and then to derive the total cluster mass profile using equation  [ eq : hse ] . for comparison with the other methods described below",
    ", it should be noted that selecting parametrized models for @xmath2 and @xmath3 is completely equivalent ( via equation  [ eq : hse ] ) to choosing parametrizations for @xmath43 and @xmath3 , and thus implicitly imposes a prior on the form of @xmath43 . because these functions share parameters , varying model parameters produces covariance in @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "that is , the choice of parametrized models also constitutes an implicit prior on the scaling relations , as described below .",
    "generalizing equation  [ eq : betamtexpect ] , we can write the mean mass  temperature relation resulting from fits to parametrized @xmath2 and @xmath3 models as ( equation  [ eq : rmsolution ] ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the full set of parameters describing @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and @xmath22 is the measured gas temperature used to form the scaling relation .",
    "typically , @xmath22 is an emission - weighted average , dominated by the signal from relatively small radii , in which case @xmath23 is a measure of the overall shape of the temperature profile . for self - similar clusters ,",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath18 are constant , to _ measured _",
    "@xmath22 vary , even for self - similar clusters .",
    "we do not consider such effects here . ] and the self - similar slope of @xmath46 is trivially recovered . however ,",
    "if either of these quantities varies systematically with mass , the slope may be perturbed from the self - similar value .",
    "the explicit appearance of the exponent @xmath46 in equation  [ eq : parammt ] makes clear that , in practice , our ability to detect departures from self - similarity using this approach depends on measuring the shape of the temperature and density profiles at @xmath9 . in the case of temperature , this is a challenging task for current x - ray observatories at even intermediate cluster radii ( e.g. @xmath47 , a common choice ) .",
    "furthermore , and not incidentally , the priors on the forms of the temperature and density ( or mass , equivalently ) profiles must be flexible enough to admit departures from self - similarity . in practice ,",
    "the parametrizations employed are generally motivated by observable features of the surface brightness and temperature profiles , raising the possibility that the relatively low signal - to - noise at intermediate radii , and subsequent assumption of regular behavior in the profiles [ i.e. similar values of @xmath23 and @xmath18 ] , produces a bias favoring self - similarity .",
    "conversely , if the parametrizations provide too much flexibility near @xmath9 to be effectively constrained by the data , then departures from self - similarity can not be constrained either . in the extreme case where the data provide no constraint at all on the profiles near @xmath9 , the bracketed expression in equation  [ eq : parammt ] simply samples the prior ( the allowed region in model parameter space ) .",
    "if that prior is independent of @xmath22 , as common practice would dictate , the resulting scaling relation must have the self - similar slope on average , with the prior simply determining the size of the scatter about the relation .",
    "this behavior is explicitly demonstrated in right panel of figure  [ fig : simple ] , which shows a mass  temperature relation resulting from random realizations of a non - isothermal , parametrized cluster model ( see appendix  [ sec : sims ] ) .",
    "the randomized density and temperature profile models vary widely in shape and normalization , but because these variations have no mass dependence , the structure of equation  [ eq : parammt ] results in a self - similar mean scaling relation .",
    "thus , the inability of current observatories to constrain high - resolution temperature profiles at the radii of interest poses a dilemma for the fully parametric approach to mass estimation . allowing too little freedom in the adopted forms of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 profiles risks assuming implicitly that clusters are self - similar . on the other hand , allowing too much freedom",
    "can result in the profiles at @xmath9 being so poorly constrained that departures from self - similarity in individual clusters can not be constrained either ; based on the argument above , this case may well also result in an apparently self - similar scaling relation on average .",
    "apart from temperature , the fully parametric mass estimate depends on the shape of @xmath2 at @xmath9 .",
    "both @xmath49 and @xmath0 have a dependence on this quantity , being integrals of @xmath2 weighted towards large radii",
    ". however , the surface brightness profile can be determined at much higher resolution than temperature from x - ray data , meaning that priors on the shape of @xmath2 need not be as influential .",
    "provided that the choice of density parametrization is not overly restrictive , we would thus expect biases towards self similarity to be less of a concern for the @xmath49@xmath40 relation compared to @xmath41@xmath40 or @xmath0@xmath40 . the x - ray luminosity  mass relation should be essentially free of this bias , since it is dominated by emission from the dense gas at cluster centers , at radii typically @xmath50 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that the @xmath20@xmath40 relation is the only one of these scalings for which the fully parametric approach to mass estimation has consistently measured strong departures from self - similarity in the slope ( e.g. @xcite ; see also section  [ sec : meta ] ) .",
    "an alternative method for determining cluster hydrostatic mass profiles was developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) . in this approach , a functional form for the total mass profile",
    "is explicitly adopted , and used in conjunction with a non - parametric description of the surface brightness to predict the temperature in concentric shells .",
    "temperature measurements from spectral data then provide the means to constrain the parameters of the mass model .",
    "in contrast to fully parametric methods , the semi - parametric approach does not restrict the forms of the icm density or temperature profiles .",
    "apart from the regularization imposed by the size of the annular regions analyzed ( a factor in all of the approaches discussed here ) , these profiles are not constrained a priori .",
    "whereas the fully parametric approach implies an implicit prior on the form of @xmath43 , the semi - parametric method explicitly adopts a prior on the form of this function , typically motivated by numerical simulations of cluster formation ( e.g. the model of @xcite , hereafter ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the semi - parametric approach does not impose a prior on the form of the mass  temperature relation ( or the other scaling relations ) in the sense of equation  [ eq : parammt ] .",
    "that is not to say that the procedure imposes no priors at all ; the choice of a particular form for the mass profile explicitly does so . in this case , however , the effect of the prior on the mass reconstruction is completely transparent , and the goodness of fit furthermore provides a means to evaluate the mass model , a significant advantage .",
    "the most general possibility for hydrostatic mass analysis is a fully non - parametric de - projection .",
    "examples include the methods introduced by @xcite and @xcite , in which numerical derivatives of non - parametric icm density and temperature profiles are directly used to reconstruct the enclosed mass , subject to the constraint that mass increase with radius ; and by @xcite , in which the total densities in concentric spherical shells are free model parameters . in a sense , these approaches are , respectively , logical extensions of the fully parametric methods , which use the derivatives of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to derive the mass , and the semi - parametric methods , which model the mass profile directly .",
    "however , these non - parametric methods require very high quality data compared to methods which impose some kind of prior on the mass distribution ; as has already been mentioned , x - ray data typically can not resolve the temperature gradient near @xmath51 .",
    "the use of these approaches has thus been relatively limited .",
    "finally , the explicit assumption of hse can be bypassed by estimating mass using a proxy ( e.g. @xmath49 or @xmath52 ) from an external scaling relation .",
    "this approach clearly carries its own prior , namely the validity of the mass proxy , which must be verified and calibrated using true mass determinations .",
    "there are also restrictions on what scaling relations can sensibly be investigated using this technique ; for example , given its definition , @xmath53-derived masses should not be used to investigate scalings with gas mass or temperature . on the other hand , for hot clusters ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath49 is a good mass proxy whose determination is essentially independent of temperature @xcite , so masses estimated from @xmath49 can reasonably be used to study the @xmath40@xmath41 relation in this mass range ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the appropriate use of mass proxies can thus potentially increase the available sample size and redshift range for studying some scaling relations .",
    "the comparison of scaling relations derived in different works is complicated by a variety of potential systematics , including ( potentially redshift - dependent ) selection effects , instrument cross - calibration , and the use of different regression methods over the years , in addition to the issues discussed in this paper ( see also appendix  [ sec : comments ] ) . nevertheless , it is interesting to test whether there is any trend in scaling relation results from the literature with the mass modeling technique employed .",
    "here we focus on mass  temperature relations measured from x - ray data , which have a particularly long history .",
    "a sampling of @xmath40@xmath41 slopes and reported uncertainties from the literature over the past 12 years is shown in figure  [ fig : mtslopes ] @xcite . in some cases",
    ", we have included multiple results from the same authors , where different data sets or mass models produced noticeably different results . in the figure , red circles are results obtained by fitting fully parametric @xmath2 and @xmath3 models .",
    "blue triangles indicate results using a non - parametric description of the icm along with an explicit prior on the form of the total mass profile ( semi - parametric methods ) .",
    "the green square reflects a study of massive clusters where gas mass was used as a proxy for total mass .",
    "temperature measurements used in the displayed results are all emission - weighted averages , and masses in a given study are estimated at a constant value of @xmath12 ( see below ) .",
    "and @xmath3 models ; blue triangles show results using a non - parametric description of the icm along with an explicit prior on the form of the total mass profile ; and the green square uses gas mass as a proxy for total mass .",
    "the dashed line shows the self - similar value of the slope . ]    among the results based on fits to very simple @xmath2 and @xmath3 models are :    1 .",
    "two results from @xcite where masses were estimated from x - ray observations .",
    "the first slope , @xmath55 , is from a heterogeneous sample with measured temperature profiles .",
    "for the second , the isothermal @xmath25 model was fitted to the data of @xcite , resulting in a slope of @xmath56 . in both cases ( as well as their third result , below ) ,",
    "masses were rescaled to @xmath57 .",
    "2 .   the first two results from @xcite use a compilation of clusters for which resolved temperature profiles were available , with masses estimated at @xmath47 by fitting a @xmath25 model density profile and assuming a polytropic relationship between gas density and temperature .",
    "the first slope , @xmath58 , uses the entire sample , while the second , @xmath59 , was obtained by excluding 4 clusters with measured @xmath60 .",
    "the third result shown from @xcite and the slope from @xcite were derived by fitting different subsets of the data of @xcite , respectively finding slopes of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the @xcite analysis provides masses at @xmath47 from isothermal @xmath25 model fits .",
    "more recent works using @xmath2 and @xmath3 fits generally have used more complicated models , which are detailed in the respective papers :    1 .",
    "@xcite used masses measured by @xcite , who fitted functions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 to x - ray data .",
    "the figure shows their slope of @xmath63 for clusters with @xmath64 at @xmath65 , the largest radius for which no extrapolation was required .",
    "their results at other radii are very similar .",
    "2 .   @xcite fitted parametrized models to 13 clusters , obtaining mass  temperature relations at @xmath66 and 500 with both emission- and mass - weighted temperatures . in the figure , we show the emission - weighted slope for @xmath47 , @xmath67 .",
    "the best fitting values in the other cases ranged from 1.51 to 1.64 .",
    "the analysis was extended to 17 clusters in @xcite , resulting in a slope of @xmath68 .",
    "3 .   @xcite fitted a sample of 23 groups and 14 clusters , spanning @xmath69 , obtaining a slope of @xmath70 at @xmath47 .",
    "4 .   @xcite",
    "fitted the models of @xcite to 28 clusters with @xmath71 , finding a slope of @xmath72 at @xmath47 .",
    "the mass  temperature slopes that rely on fully parametric fits to @xmath2 and @xmath3 tend to cluster in the 1.501.65 range .",
    "the exceptions are one result from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* using the isothermal @xmath25 model ) and one from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* using a polytropic model ) . in the former case , @xcite comment",
    "that there exists a clear correlation between measured values of @xmath38 and @xmath25 in the data @xcite , @xmath73 . based on section  [ sec : isothermalbeta ]",
    ", one might expect such a correlation to result in a steeper slope when the isothermal @xmath25 model is used .",
    "the simple @xmath42 formula from section  [ sec : isothermalbeta ] over - predicts the size of the effect : @xmath74 implies a yet steeper slope than was observed .",
    "the full explanation likely involves the effect of the third fit parameter , @xmath75 , as well as the measurement errors and the method used to fit the scaling relation . in @xcite , eliminating the clusters with the smallest @xmath25 measurements ( which also happen to be at the low - temperature end of the data set ) reduces both the empirical @xmath25@xmath38 correlation and the mass  temperature slope ( compare their first and second results in the figure ) , supporting the qualitative notion that model parameter correlations contribute to steepening of the slope .",
    "similarly , the @xcite data set used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their third result above ) and @xcite has an empirically smaller correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath25 , and fits to a correspondingly shallower slope .",
    "the works using more complicated @xmath2 and @xmath3 models generally show less strong departures from the self - similar value .",
    "relatively fewer authors have used an explicit prior on the form of the mass profile , along with a non - parametric description of the icm :    1 .",
    "the third result from @xcite employs masses from @xcite , obtaining a slope of @xmath76 .",
    "the mass profiles were constrained by a combination of galaxy velocity dispersion and x - ray temperature data .",
    "2 .   @xcite fitted a mass profile motivated by @xcite to x - ray data for 24 hot ( @xmath77 ) clusters , obtaining a slope of @xmath78 at @xmath66 . however , when they allow the normalization of the scaling relation to evolve with redshift , the measured mass  temperature slope is steeper , @xmath79 .",
    "3 .   @xcite fitted an mass profile to non - parametric surface brightness and temperature data for 42 massive , dynamically relaxed clusters , obtaining hse masses at @xmath66 .",
    "the profile provides an acceptable fit to the data ( see also @xcite ) . combining these mass measurements with temperatures from an extension of the work in @xcite",
    ", we obtain a mass  temperature slope of @xmath80 ( see appendix  [ sec : a08mt ] ) .    the final result shown in the figure",
    "is from @xcite , who used gas mass as a proxy to estimate total masses at @xmath81 for a sample of 94 hot , massive clusters , obtaining a mass  temperature slope of @xmath82 . because the gas mass fraction was calibrated using the data of @xcite , the two results are not entirely independent . on the other hand ,",
    "relatively few of the @xcite clusters are in the @xcite data set , so this dependence should largely be limited to the normalization of the scaling relation .",
    "apart from the @xcite slope , which has a large uncertainty , the results that use explicit priors on the form of the mass profile or employ gas mass as a proxy appear to prefer a relatively steep slope compared with the other works , @xmath83 . given that mass models such as the profile are well motivated by numerical simulations and provide an acceptable fit to cluster data ( e.g. @xcite ) , the segregation apparent in figure  [ fig : mtslopes ] suggests that the implicit priors in fully parametric @xmath2 and @xmath3 models bias the resulting @xmath40@xmath41 slopes towards the self - similar value .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the influence of priors on hydrostatic mass estimates of clusters and on the resulting mass  observable scaling relations .",
    "the use of fully parametric gas density ( or x - ray brightness ) and temperature profiles , similar to those commonly used in the literature , introduces an implicit prior on the form of the mass profile via the hydrostatic equation .",
    "furthermore , the structure of the prior thus imposed results in an implicit prior on the cluster scaling relations .",
    "if the parametrized models employed are insufficiently flexible , or conversely if they are too general to be constrained at the radii of interest , then constraints on the scaling relations will be biased towards having self - similar slopes .",
    "alternative techniques for hydrostatic mass measurement exist which , by construction , do not suffer from this bias .",
    "the most common of these is a semi - parametric approach , in which a parametric prior on the form for the mass profile is explicitly adopted , with the icm described independently and non - parametrically .",
    "typically , the priors used here are motivated by the results of numerical simulations .",
    "an advantage of the semi - parametric approach is that it requires no a priori assumptions about the potentially complex form of the icm density and temperature profiles , and that the applicability of the mass profile model can be straightforwardly evaluated through the goodness of fit .",
    "we comment further on the relative merits of various methods , and offer general recommendations , in appendix  [ sec : comments ] .    in the literature ,",
    "results for the mass  temperature slope obtained by fitting parametric @xmath2 and @xmath3 profiles tend to cluster relatively near the self - similar value .",
    "semi - parametric analyses appear to prefer a significantly steeper mass  temperature relation , although there are relatively few such works to consider .",
    "while a variety of systematic effects can potentially affect the scaling relations , this segregation of values for the @xmath40@xmath41 slope suggests that the priors imposed during mass estimation have a significant influence that needs to be considered carefully .    as cluster surveys at all wavelengths",
    "are expanded to higher and higher redshifts , and are used to investigate more complex cosmological questions , accurate calibration of the relevant scaling relations will only become more important .",
    "gravitational lensing will make a unique contribution to these efforts , particularly in assessing the residual bias in icm - based mass estimates due to the hse assumption .",
    "nevertheless , icm - based mass measurements for relaxed systems will remain an important ingredient in cluster cosmology due to the higher precision and lower systematic scatter of individual estimates compared to lensing .",
    "it is therefore critical , going forward , that the priors employed in these measurements be minimal , straightforwardly testable , and well understood .",
