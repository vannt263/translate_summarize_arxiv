    "the weibull and ew distributions provide a simple and close form solution to many problems in lifetime and reliability . however",
    ", they do not provide a reasonable parametric fit for some practical applications , for example the weibull distribution is not useful for modeling phenomenon with non - monotone failure rates .",
    "the bathtub - shaped and the unimodal failure rates which are common in reliability and biological studies can not be modeled by the weibull distribution .",
    "recently , attempts have been made to define new families of probability distributions that extend well - known families of distributions and at the same time provide great flexibility in modeling data in practice .",
    "the exponential - geometric ( eg ) , exponential - poisson ( ep ) , exponential - logarithmic ( el ) , exponential - power series ( eps ) , weibull - geometric ( wg ) and weibull - power series ( wps ) distributions were introduced and studied by adamidis and loukas @xcite , kus @xcite , tahmasbi and rezaei @xcite , chahkandi and ganjali @xcite , barreto - souza et al .",

    "the main reasons for introducing the ewp distribution are : ( i ) this distribution due to its flexibility in accommodating different forms of the risk function is an important model that can be used in a variety of problems in modeling lifetime data .",
    "( ii ) this distribution is a suitable model in a complementary risk problem base ( basu and klein , @xcite ) in presence of latent risks , in the sense that there is no information about which factor was responsible for the component failure and only the maximum lifetime value among all risks is observed .",
