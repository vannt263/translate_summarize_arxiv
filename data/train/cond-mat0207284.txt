    "despite being in principle a simpler system , hard - disk fluid mixtures have received much less attention in the literature than fluid mixtures of hard spheres .",
    "this may well be tied to the fact that up to now no analytical solution to the percus  yevick equation has been found for even dimensionality . in any case , what this has meant is that fewer results are available for fluid mixtures of hard disks than for hard - sphere mixtures .",
    "in particular , a very scarce number of proposals for the equation of state ( eos ) of these mixtures has been made @xcite , although the trend seems to be reversing recently , and even fewer simulations have been performed to assess the value of such proposals . in a recent paper , barrio and",
    "solana @xcite proposed an eos for a binary mixture of additive hard disks .",
    "such an equation reproduces the ( known ) exact second and third virial coefficients of the mixture and may be expressed in terms of the eos of a single component system .",
    "they also performed monte carlo simulations and found that their recipe was very accurate provided an also very accurate eos for the single component system ( in their case it was the eos proposed by woodcock @xcite ) was taken as input .",
    "the comparison with other eos for the mixture available in the literature indicated that their proposal does the best job with respect to the monte carlo data . among these other eos for the binary mixture considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the one introduced by santos _",
    "a few years ago @xcite also shares with barrio and solana s eos the fact that it may be expressed in terms of the eos for a single component system .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present a detailed analysis of these two different equations of state since the comparison made in ref .",
    "@xcite may be misleading in that it was not performed by taking the _ same _ eos for the single component system in both proposals .",
    "a preliminary report of this work can be found in ref.@xcite .    in order to carry out the analysis ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we recall the two different formulations for the eos of a binary mixture of additive hard disks in a unified notation as well as provide the explicit ( approximate ) expressions for the eos of the single component system that will be used in the actual calculations .",
    "this is followed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] by a discussion of the results and some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider a binary mixture of additive hard disks of diameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the total number density is @xmath2 , the mole fractions are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the packing fraction is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the compressibility factor , @xmath8 being the pressure , @xmath9 the absolute temperature and @xmath10 the boltzmann constant .",
    "then , barrio and solana s eos for a binary mixture of hard disks , @xmath11 , may be written in terms of a given eos for a single component system , @xmath12 , as @xmath13 ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is adjusted as to reproduce the exact third virial coefficient for the mixture @xmath16 , namely @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the reduced third virial coefficient for the single component system and @xmath16 is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the eos for the mixture , consistent with a given eos for a single component system , introduced recently by santos _",
    "_ reads @xcite @xmath22 we stress the fact that eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is simpler than eq.([1 ] ) [ which must be complemented with eqs.([2])([4 ] ) ] .",
    "in addition , the structure of eq.([5 ] ) is valid for any number of components , while eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) requires the third virial coefficient , which is known exactly only for _ binary _ mixtures . in order to proceed with a quantitative analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , we have to specify @xmath12 . while many choices are available , we will restrict ourselves to the three following eos of the single component system :    1 .   woodcock",
    "s eos @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the value of the crystalline close - packing and the @xmath25 @xmath26 are the ( known ) reduced virial coefficients @xcite .",
    "2 .   the levin approximant of erpenbeck and luban @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath286@xmath29n@xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "3 .   the eos proposed by santos _",
    "@xcite @xmath32    the eos ( [ woodcock ] ) and ( [ levin ] ) are more complex than the eos ( [ shy ] ) in the sense that they require the exact knowledge of the first six virial coefficients , while eq .",
    "( [ shy ] ) is constructed by using the first two virial coefficients only and enforcing a pole at @xmath33 . despite its simplicity",
    ", however , eq .  ( [ shy ] ) does a remarkably good job when compared with simulation data , although it is of course less accurate than the more sophisticated eos ( [ woodcock ] ) and ( [ levin ] ) @xcite .",
    "in table [ table1 ] , we show the results of eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) when woodcock s eos @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ woodcock ] ) , for the single component system is used as input in both equations , as well as the available mc data @xcite . as seen in table [ table1 ]",
    ", it is fair to say that both recipes are of comparable accuracy with respect to the monte carlo results , their difference being generally smaller than the error bars of the simulation data , although @xmath11 performs slightly better than @xmath34 .",
    "this may be fortuitous since if one takes for @xmath12 in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) the levin approximant @xcite , eq .   ( [ levin ] ) , ( which is known to give the most accurate approximation to the single component compressibility factor @xcite ) the apparent ( slight ) superiority of @xmath11 is no longer there . for instance , the theoretical values of table [ table1 ] corresponding to the packing fraction @xmath35 are increased by about 0.03 when the levin approximant rather than woodcock s eos is used as input , so that in this case the accuracy of @xmath34 is generally slightly better than that of @xmath11 .",
    "this is further illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] , where in order to enhance the differences we have plotted @xmath36 versus @xmath37 , @xmath38 indicating the use of eq.([1 ] ) taking for @xmath12 the eos by woodcock .",
    "the figures show that , in general , the differences between the eos ( [ 1 ] ) and the eos ( [ 5 ] ) , taking of course the same @xmath39 as input , are smaller than or of the order of the error bars of the simulation data . as expected , a better agreement with the simulation data is obtained when either of the more accurate eos ( [ woodcock ] ) or ( [ levin ] ) is used as input instead of the much simpler eos ( [ shy ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the best agreement at the two largest densities , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , corresponds to the use of the levin approximant for @xmath39 .",
    "let us try to understand why both eos for the mixture give practically equivalent results when the same input is used in both .",
    "first , it may be shown that @xmath34 , while not reproducing the exact third virial coefficient @xmath16 , yields a very good estimate of it @xcite , namely @xmath42(\\pi/4)^2\\langle \\sigma^2\\rangle^2 $ ] .",
    "if we replace that estimate into eq.([2 ] ) , we get @xmath43 by using this estimate in barrio and solana s eos , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 \\left [ z_{\\text{s}}(\\eta ) -1\\right ] -\\frac{\\eta } { 1-\\eta } . \\label{8}\\ ] ] according to the approximation involved in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , the difference @xmath46 is small if the asymmetry of the mixture is small ( @xmath47 ) and/or @xmath48 is small . the function @xmath49 is plotted in fig .   [ fig4 ] for the cases where @xmath12 is given by woodcock s eos , by the levin approximant , and by the shy eos . in all instances it is practically zero up to @xmath50 but then it grows rapidly .",
    "the most disparate mixture considered in barrio and solana s simulations corresponds to @xmath51 , @xmath52 , which yields @xmath53 .",
    "this explains the fact that @xmath54 in the simulated cases .",
    "it should be noted however that eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) tends to overestimate the actual difference @xmath55 ( for instance , in the case where @xmath51 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is given by woodcock s eos , this difference is @xmath59 , while the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) yields @xmath60 ) , so that its main purpose is to illustrate the fact that both eos yield practically equivalent results for not very asymmetric mixtures . on the other hand",
    ", more important differences can be expected for disparate mixtures , especially in the case of large densities . at a given density and a given diameter ratio @xmath61 the smallest value of the parameter @xmath62 corresponds to a mole fraction @xmath63 for the large disks , namely @xmath64 .",
    "thus , @xmath65 if @xmath66 and , according to eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath67 .",
    "let us consider now the limit in which the small disks become point particles ( @xmath68 ) and occupy a negligible fraction of the total area .",
    "in that case , the compressibility factor of the mixture must reduce to @xcite @xmath69 the first term represents the ( ideal gas ) partial pressure due to the point particles in the available area ( i.e. , the total area minus the area occupied by the large disks ) , while the second term represents the partial pressure associated with the large disks . in the limit @xmath68 with @xmath3",
    "finite ( or , more generally , for @xmath70 ) , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 [ note that in this limit the approximation ( [ 6 ] ) becomes correct ] , so that @xmath73 @xmath74 \\left [ z_{\\text{s}}(\\eta ) -1\\right ] .",
    "\\label{11}\\ ] ] therefore , while eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is consistent with the exact property ( [ 9 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) violates it .",
    "in fact , the right - hand side of ( [ 7 ] ) , with @xmath75 , gives the deviation of barrio and solana s eos from the exact compressibility factor in the special case @xmath68 .",
    "in summary , in this report we have performed a detailed comparison of the eos proposed by barrio and solana @xcite and the one introduced by santos _ et al .",
    "we find that both proposals lead to comparable accuracy when the same eos for the single component system is used and confirm that the more accurate the @xmath12 the more accurate the resulting compressibility factor for the binary mixture . in favor of santos _",
    "s proposal , apart from its simpler form which also yields a very reasonable estimate of the known third virial coefficient , is the fact that it is readily extendible to the multicomponent case ( including polydisperse mixtures ) and complies with the exact limit in which the small disks are point particles , while @xmath11 does not share these assets .    the research of m.l.h .",
