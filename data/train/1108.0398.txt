    "with the lhc recently surpassing the tevatron for the world record in hadron collider beam intensity and energy , we stand ready to test and expand our current understanding of particle physics .",
    "the lhc is well on its way in hunting for the higgs boson and for physics beyond the standard model . to engage in these ambitious searches",
    ", however , a detailed picture of standard model backgrounds is necessary .",
    "higher order qcd is an important theoretical tool in both higgs production and the standard model background .",
    "the qcd corrections are large and much effort has been dedicated to calculating important cross sections @xcite .",
    "while some processes will require next - to - next - to - leading order precision and resummation of large logarithms , for many processes knowledge through next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the perturbative expansion will be sufficient .",
    "this need for nlo calculations has been discussed and codified in an experimenter s wishlist @xcite .",
    "one - loop calculations in qcd are therefore a crucial part of theoretical studies of backgrounds and signals at the lhc .",
    "as the number of external partons increases , feynman - diagrammatic techniques encounter difficulties , especially at loop level .",
    "this has motivated many attempts to seek improved techniques . in recent years",
    "there has been rapid progress significantly reducing the computational intensity behind nlo calculations .",
    "the unitarity method , pioneered by bern , dixon , dunbar and kosower in the mid - nineties @xcite , offers an alternative using the branch - cut structure of loop integrals to find the coefficients of the integrals in terms of products of on - shell tree amplitudes .",
    "use of generalized unitarity is natural in this framework , giving further enhancements to the method  @xcite .",
    "the tree amplitudes are sewn together across various generalized channels to reconstruct the loop amplitude . in this way",
    "only physical degrees of freedom are used .",
    "one - loop amplitudes for various supersymmetric theories can be constructed in their entirety through the use of four - dimensional cuts , though non - supersymmetric theories , including qcd , have cut - free rational terms that must be handled through other means  @xcite . by using complex momenta ,",
    "britto , cachazo and feng showed that generalized quadruple cuts determine all scalar box integral coefficients as products of four on - shell tree amplitudes @xcite , motivating new reduction procedures on the integrand .",
    "ossola , papadopoulos and pittau ( opp ) followed suit with a purely algebraic method to reduce tensor integrals to a basis of master scalar integrals @xcite in a form directly usable in numerical programs .",
    "the opp method uses a particular parametrization of the loop momentum to find coefficients for all scalar integrals by solving a system of linear equations .",
    "forde followed with a method for simple extraction of triangle and bubble coefficients in four - dimensional cuts that exploits the analytic structure of the integrand @xcite .",
    "coefficients for all scalar integrals can be found through the limiting behavior of the products of tree amplitudes by using the momentum parametrization in ref .",
    "@xcite , first given in ref .",
    "@xcite . a numerical variant of forde s method",
    "was then developed and applied in ref .",
    "there have also been important improvements in feynman diagrammatic techniques  @xcite .",
    "another important technique that greatly simplifies amplitude calculations is helicity methods  @xcite . at tree level",
    "these lead to enormous simplifications , especially for massless amplitudes . the massless spinor - helicity formalism in four dimensions",
    "has been an invaluable tool for simplifying calculations and exposing the structure of amplitudes starting with the discovery of the parke - taylor formula for maximally helicity - violating tree amplitudes  @xcite . at loop level helicity methods have also played an important role in pushing back the calculational frontiers .",
    "recently the first nlo calculation of a hadron - collider process with five final - state objects was presented : @xmath1 + 4-jet production  @xcite .",
    "this calculation relied on using spinor variables in the tree amplitudes composing the unitarity cuts .    at loop level",
    "the application of four - dimensional helicity methods is much trickier than at tree level because of the use of dimensional regularization , which requires that the loop momenta be outside of four dimensions .",
    "this can drop rational pieces not captured by four - dimensional unitarity cuts .",
    "a purely four - dimensional method relies instead on on - shell recursion relations to reconstruct the rational pieces  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to abandon four - dimensional helicity in the cuts and use @xmath0-dimensional generalized cuts , which simultaneously give cut - constructible and rational terms  @xcite .",
    "rational terms arise through the interference of the divergences in loop integrals with the order @xmath2 pieces of @xmath3-dimensional loop momenta .",
    "a means for tracking these within the opp framework in terms of a set of feynman - like rules has been given in ref .",
    "work by ellis , giele , kunszt and melnikov combines @xmath0-dimensional generalized unitarity with the opp method for numerical calculations  @xcite . a related approach due to badger @xcite associates the @xmath4-dimensional pieces to masses to give the rational terms , and a numerical version of this has been developed and applied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given the success of helicity methods when combined with generalized unitarity at pushing back the frontiers  @xcite , it seems reasonable to try to find improved means of combining the two techniques . in this paper",
    "we bring @xmath0-dimensional unitarity and spinor helicity together : we work in @xmath5 using a six - dimensional helicity formalism due to cheung and oconnell @xcite to calculate qcd amplitudes , including nlo corrections to higgs processes , at one loop .",
    "we capture both the cut - constructible and rational pieces while enjoying the conveniences of a spinor - helicity formalism , and are in fact able to write the answer in terms of massless four - dimensional spinors through a decomposition of their six - dimensional counterparts . at the end of the calculation",
    ", we analytically continue the loop momenta to @xmath6 dimensions and perform a state - sum reduction to reduce the spin states of six dimensions to match our desired regularization scheme . in this paper",
    "we focus on the four - dimensional helicity ( fdh ) scheme @xcite .",
    "loop computations combining six - dimensional helicity and unitarity to obtain supersymmetric amplitudes have been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite , though for the cases treated there , there was no need to apply a state - sum reduction procedure as we do here .",
    "we illustrate the technique using various four - point qcd amplitudes as examples , including ones with external quarks .",
    "we also present a simple five - point example . as a more sophisticated example",
    ", we evaluate an amplitude involving the higgs boson and three gluons .",
    "this process is mediated by a heavy - quark loop @xcite , so nlo involves a two - loop process . however , in the large top - quark mass limit , we can replace the top loop with an effective operator @xcite , thereby bringing our nlo computation down to one loop . in all cases",
    "we reproduce known results confirming the validity of the formalism .",

    "section [ 4pointglue ] brings us to sample calculations of the one - loop four - gluon amplitude @xmath8 for various internal - particle states .",
    "we find that a state - sum reduction is necessary to eliminate the extra - dimensional polarization states of six dimensions compared to four dimensions .",
    "we also present our results for a maximally helicity - violating configuration for a gluon loop , as well as for the five - point amplitude @xmath9 . in section [ extferm ]",

    "the dependence of a one - loop coefficient on the dimensionality of spacetime is at most linear .",
    "such terms arise from a closed loop of contracted metric tensors and/or gamma matrices from vertices and propagators making up the loop .",

    "suppose we calculate in @xmath221 with five - dimensional loop momentum .",
    "we will have three polarization states of the internal gluons , and we will obtain coefficients for five dimensions .",
    "now suppose we upgrade to @xmath5 but leave our loop momentum in five dimensions .",
    "we view this as being the same loop momentum as in the @xmath221 case ; the only difference is now we have added an additional polarization state of the gluon , which can be thought of as being along the sixth dimension of six - dimensional space .    it should be noted that the restriction on the loop momentum does not prevent us from obtaining the correct @xmath5 coefficient ; problems arise only when we take it down to four dimensions .",
    "this can be understood through a fact mentioned in appendix [ intbasisapp ] : the loop momentum components beyond four dimensions only enter coefficients in a particular combination through contractions of the loop momentum with itself , @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the four- and @xmath4-dimensional pieces of the loop momentum respectively .",
    "as long as we do not set this to @xmath196 , we find the full coefficient ( for a more in depth discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "so , the contribution to the @xmath5 coefficient due to the extra polarization state ( with polarization along the sixth dimension ) is exactly the difference between the @xmath221 and @xmath5 coefficients . to see what this difference is",
    ", we go to the feynman rules .",
    "a relevant three - gluon vertex , with polarizations taken into account , is @xmath225 where @xmath226 is an outgoing external momentum and @xmath159 and @xmath227 are outgoing internal loop momenta .",
    "we wish to examine the contribution from the polarization in the sixth dimension , so we look at only those components of @xmath228 and @xmath229 . when these are contracted with @xmath230 , @xmath226 , @xmath159 or @xmath227 , they vanish since none of those vectors contain a sixth - dimensional component .",
    "the only non - vanishing contraction is that between the sixth - dimensional components of @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "our vertex then becomes    @xmath231    up to a sign depending on the normalization of the polarization vectors .",
    "this is the two - real - scalar gluon vertex with polarization of the gluon included .",
    "therefore the contribution of the polarization in the sixth dimension is equal to that of a scalar particle , and the @xmath221 and @xmath5 coefficients differ by a coefficient found using cuts where the internal gluon loop has been replaced by a scalar loop , @xmath232 for our fdh coefficient then , we find @xmath233 coefficients in the fdh scheme can be found from six - dimensional coefficients by subtracting twice the contribution of a scalar - loop diagram .",
    "( here we only studied the three - gluon vertex .",
    "similar arguments can be used for a four - gluon vertex ; in fact , it is true that any @xmath65-gluon tree amplitude with two gluons polarized along the sixth dimension is equivalent to a tree amplitude with @xmath234 gluons and two scalars @xcite . )",
    "this leads us to the physical interpretation that the polarization states in six dimensions consist of the polarization states of four dimensions plus two scalars , but that they may be mixed in some nontrivial way .",
