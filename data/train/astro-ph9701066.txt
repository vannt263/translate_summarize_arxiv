    "the henry draper classification divided carbon stars into two groups n and r on the basis of their spectral features .",
    "the n stars exhibit very strong depression of light in the violet part of the spectrum .",
    "they are the classical carbon stars that are most easily detected in infrared surveys and used as tracers of an intermediate age population in extragalactic objects .",
    "the r stars , on the other hand , have warmer temperatures , and blue / violet light is accessible to observation , and atmospheric analysis .    the most extensive analysis of the r stars has been done by dominy ( 1984 ) , who found that in the warm r0@xmath1r4 stars , c is overabundant on average by approximately 0.7 dex relative to the sun and to normal g and k giants . on the other hand he found that the o abundance is normally near solar , and the n abundance just slightly enhanced . at cno cycle equilibrium",
    "both c and o are depleted substantially . the lack of oxygen and carbon depletion , therefore , led dominiy to the conclusion that the cno cycle operating near equilibrium is not responsible for the fact that c / o @xmath2 1 in these stars .",
    "the excess carbon has to come from some other process .",
    "dominy also found that the s process element abundances are nearly solar , similar to results of gordon ( 1968 ) , and green et al .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with most other carbon and carbon - related stars ( see reviews by mcclure 1984a , 1985 ) .",
    "the n , s , barium , ch , sgch , and dwarf carbon stars all have significantly enhanced abundances of the s process elements relative to iron ( e.g. , lambert 1985 ; green and margon 1994 ) .",
    "the n stars and many of the s stars are assumed to have undergone helium - shell flashing on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and the third dredge - up phase has brought carbon and s process elements to the surface ( e.g. , see iben and renzini 1983 ) .    like many of the barium , ch , sgch and dwarf carbon stars , the warmer r stars are too faint to be on the agb .",
    "scalo ( 1976 ) has reviewed the status of various carbon - related stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , and has pointed out that the r0@xmath1r4 stars lie in a similar temperature / luminosity domain as the barium stars .",
    "they are well below the lower luminosity boundary of the onset of helium shell flashing .",
    "the lack of s process enhancement , and low luminosity led dominy ( 1984 ) to conclude that the r stars probably received their enhanced carbon from the helium - core flash at the tip of the first ascent giant branch .",
    "this still remains the most viable hypothesis , although it is not known how the core - flash contaminants have been mixed to the surface of the star .",
    "in the late 1970 s , it had become apparent that the classical carbon stars could be explained by helium - shell flashing on the agb , whereas many of the other stars with enhanced carbon could not , because they were too faint for agb evolution .",
    "mcclure ( 1979 ) , suggested the possibility that the ch stars were binaries , because in globular clusters they tended to be found only in ones of very low central concentration where binaries may not be disrupted as easily .",
    "a velocity survey of the barium stars quickly led to the conclusion that all barium stars are binaries ( mcclure , fletcher and nemec 1980 ) , and later surveys showed that ch stars as well as barium stars are all binaries ( mcclure 1983 , 1984b ) , presumably having undergone mass - transfer episodes .",
    "these results were confirmed by observations of jorissen and mayor ( 1988 ) , who also showed that a large fraction of s stars are binaries .",
    "the latter stars are found to belong to two groups ( e.g. brown et .",
    "al . 1990 and references therein ) . those that exhibit the radioactive s process element tc",
    "are single agb stars undergoing helium - shell flashing that is slowly raising the c / o ratio to greater than unity .",
    "those that do not exhibit tc are found to be all binaries that have received material contaminated with c and s process elements from a companion that had undergone helium - shell flashing on the agb .",
    "thus a binary mass - transfer hypothesis has explained most of the carbon - related objects that are either too faint to be on the agb , or that do not exhibit radioactive tc , which has a half life that is a good fraction of a star s lifetime on the agb .",
    "the peculiar abundances in these stars all originated from the agb .",
    "the warmer r stars suffer the same problem in our understanding that we had in the late 1970 s for the barium and ch stars .",
    "they are too faint to be agb stars .",
    "therefore , when it was found that barium stars were likely all binaries , a survey was begun of radial velocities of the r stars also .",
    "note , however , that at that time the s process abundance of the r stars was unclear .",
    "therefore , it was considered quite possible that the r stars would fit into the same agb @xmath1 carbon star connection as the barium and ch stars .",
    "a sample of 38 r stars ( based on their hd classes ) was picked , mostly from the compilation by yamashita ( 1972 ) , who examined spectra of a large number of carbon stars , and identified strengths of various bands and lines for each star . among the r stars ,",
    "the warmer r0@xmath1r4 stars are the most similar to normal giants , and less likely to exhibit velocity `` jitter '' characteristic of more luminous giants which have more extended and less stable atmospheres . mostly r0@xmath1r4 stars were included in the sample , therefore , but a few r5-r9 stars were also observed .",
    "the problems of sorting out other types that may contaminate the sample ( in particular the ch stars ) will be discussed below .",
    "the observations were performed using the radial - velocity spectrometer on the 1.2-m telescope of the dominion astrophysical observatory in victoria ( see fletcher et al .",
    "1982 ; mcclure et al .",
    "1985 for descriptions of the instrument ) .",
    "although this instrument is capable of a precision of about @xmath3 0.3 km s@xmath4 , because of the faintness of the r stars and the limited time spent per observation , the final errors were larger than this . from repeated observations , the standard deviation of a single observation",
    "was found to be on the average @xmath5 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the radial - velocity values and julian dates ( @xmath6 ) for all observations in the sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is very difficult to pick a pure sample of a particular type of carbon star because they are defined by spectral characteristics which may be difficult to detect at low dispersion , and these characteristics sometime overlap between different stellar - population types .",
    "the approach taken here was to select a fairly large sample of stars that had been classified as type r , and worry later about sorting out misclassified objects , when better data and classifications became available .",
    "unfortunately , as a result of this , some non - r stars have been included in my previous preliminary estimates of binary frequency ( e.g. , mcclure 1989 ) .",
    "the final adopted classifications for stars in the sample are listed in table 2 .      with the most recent classifications , especially those of keenan ( 1993 ) and barnbaum et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , there are four stars in the sample that should be rejected because they are n stars .",
    "the velocities for these four stars are shown at the top of figure 1 .",
    "the scatter in velocities for each of them is significantly greater than the precision of the spectrometer , and greater than the scatter for the true r stars in the sample .",
    "the average of the standard deviations of the individual observations is @xmath3 1.62 km s@xmath4 .",
    "however , there is no evidence for long - term binary motion , the scatter being just a `` jitter '' which is typical for high luminosity stars with extended atmospheres ( e.g. , pryor et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "eight stars in the sample are classified as r5-r9 , and the velocity data for these are shown in the middle part of figure 1 .",
    "these stars again are well up on the giant branch , and they exhibit a similar velocity jitter .",
    "the average of the standard deviations for the individual observations in this case is @xmath3 1.60 km s@xmath4 .",
    "again , there is no convincing evidence for binary motion .",
    "the star with the largest deviations , hd 59643 , is the coolest star in the sample , with a classification of r9 .",
    "the problem of distinguishing between ch stars and r stars is a very difficult one , especially if the spectra are at rather low resolution as is the case for many of these stars .",
    "it is very important that this be done , however , because the ch stars have been shown to be binaries ( mcclure 1984b ) , and since we are trying to determine the binary frequency for the r stars here , we do not want ch binaries contaminating the sample .",
    "the ch stars were mostly classified as r stars before they were recognized as a separate class by keenan ( 1942 ) .",
    "the main distinguishing spectral features are very strong ch bands , enhanced lines of s process elements and weaker fe group elements as well as various strengths of c@xmath7 bands .",
    "many r stars also have quite strong ch , however ( see yamashita 1972 , figure 10e ) , and at low dispersion where the strengths of narrow lines are difficult to estimate , a ch star may look very similar to an r star .",
    "the ch stars are mostly high - velocity - halo objects , whereas the r stars belong to the low - velocity - old - disk population ( mcleod 1947 ) .",
    "therefore , any high - velocity object can normally be assumed to be a ch star .",
    "there are , however , a few low velocity ch stars , which yamashita ( 1975a ) has identified spectroscopically , and referred to as `` ch - like '' stars . their spectra appear to be identical to the ch stars .",
    "if stars of this type are misclassified as r stars , they will contaminate the sample , and may affect the estimation of binary frequency .",
    "one star , hd 16115 , which has been classified by yamashita ( 1975a ) , and by keenan ( 1993 ) as a ch - like star , has been kept in the r star list on the basis of its s process and fe abundance .",
    "although ch bands are strong , dominy ( 1984 ) finds a nearly normal abundance at high dispersion for both the s process elements and fe in this star , and this is one of the main distinguishing features between a ch and an r classification .",
    "four other stars , whose velocities are exhibited at the bottom of figure 1 , have been classified as ch or ch - like .",
    "hd 85066 remained with an r3 classification in the compilation by yamashita ( 1972 ) , although it exhibits his strongest ch index value .",
    "hartwick and cowley ( 1985 ) , on the other hand , have classified it more recently at higher resolution as a ch star .",
    "this star is a definite binary with a period of 2902 days .",
    "the other three stars have been classified as ch - like by yamashita ( 1975a ) .",
    "bd  @xmath8 is a definite binary with a period of 446 days .",
    "bd  @xmath9 exhibits erratic velocity behavior , although it can not be due to long term binary motion .",
    "perhaps there has been a difficulty with identification on some nights at the telescope , but because it is not an r star , it is not important for the present subject .",
    "one other ch - like star hd 197604 shows no evidence for binary motion .",
    "if one neglects bd  @xmath9 , two out of three ch - like stars are binaries , which is not inconsistent with the high binary frequency of their high - velocity counterparts .",
    "orbital elements are listed in table 3 for the two ch stars that are definite binaries .",
    "the velocities as a function of phase , resulting from the orbital solutions are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the velocities for the remaining 22 r0@xmath1r4 stars are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the range of dates in the plots is from mid-1979 to mid-1996 .",
    "one would be hard pressed to see any evidence for binary motion from these r0@xmath1r4 star data .",
    "this is surprising considering that the binary frequency for normal g - k giants appears to be of the order of 20% .",
    "gunn and griffin ( 1979 ) comment that in their velocity observations of field giants , about 30% of stars are variable with amplitudes of a few km s@xmath4 over times scales of a few years .",
    "mermilliod and mayor ( 1992 ) have carried out the most extensive systematic velocity program for binary detection among late - type giants , having surveyed numerous stars in 177 open clusters .",
    "they find 187 binaries among 905 giants , or a frequency of @xmath021% .",
    "monitoring of a small random sample of 39 k giants by the present author , the same sample as discussed in harris and mcclure ( 1983 ) supplemented by more recent observations , shows six binaries , or a frequency of 15% .    comparing zero binaries among 22 r stars , with this large combined sample of normal giant stars",
    ", one can carry out a @xmath10 test of homogeneity in a @xmath11 contingency table ( johnson and bhattacharyya 1985 ) .",
    "this gives a @xmath10 of 5.621 , indicting that the possibility that the r stars have a normal binary frequency can be rejected at the 98% confidence level !",
    "if one were to retain r5 stars in the sample , this would provide five more non - binaries , since even with the small velocity jitter in these , long term velocity variation can be ruled out .",
    "they just add to the significance of this result .",
    "it appears very likely that some process that produces carbon in the atmospheres of r stars can not operate in a binary system , or alternatively , causes any original binary companion to disappear .",
    "the first possibility seems remote .",
    "it is difficult to think of such a process that will operate in single stars but not in wide binary systems .",
    "likely , given the luminosities of the warmer r stars , the process in question is one that mixes helium - core - flash material to the surface of the star .",
    "possibly the r stars were all binaries at one time , and the process in question caused the disappearance of their companions .",
    "the most likely event would be the coalescence of a binary system that had a separation of components that was too small for evolution up the giant and asymptotic branches to proceed normally .",
    "coalescence perhaps causes mixing in the vicinity of the core during or after the helium - core flash .",
    "smith and demarque ( 1980 ) discuss the effects of mixing at the core flash in the context of trying to explain the existence of the sgch stars .",
    "they showed that the star becomes fainter than the normal horizontal branch as hydrogen is mixed into the core . during the second ascent up the giant branch , convection zones",
    "might then reach down to bring the carbon produced in the flash up to the surface .",
    "they concluded that the sgch stars were too faint to be explained in this manner .",
    "however , the r stars are significantly brighter than this , and smith and demarque s analysis could very well apply to them , with coalescence of a companion being the process that causes the mixing .",
    "if the r stars are produced in this way , one would expect no subgiant or dwarf r stars , and this does appear to be the case .",
    "the subgiant and dwarf carbon - related stars that have been analyzed all have enhanced s process elements ( green and margon 1994 ; bond , private communication ) , unlike the r stars .",
    "one might expect , given the present hypothesis , that the resulting star should be rotating .",
    "angular momentum would be gained by the stellar atmosphere from the orbital energy of the companion spiraling in to the center of the r star .",
    "for this reason , observations were made in july 1996 to measure the width of spectral lines in several r stars , and in normal k giants for comparison .",
    "cross - correlation line profiles of these stars were observed with the same radial - velocity spectrometer which was used for the radial - velocity measurements , but care was taken to obtain a complete profile including continuum on each side of the line .",
    "figure 4 shows this comparison for two r stars ( dots ) relative to two k giants ( solid curves ) .",
    "there is no evidence for rotational broadening of the r star profiles , so that this must be taken into account in any binary evolution explanation .",
    "angular momentum gained by a model stellar atmosphere must be dissipated or transferred inwards for this hypothesis to remain viable .",
    "i wish to thank doug bond , murray fletcher , les saddlemyer , and frank younger for help over the years in operation of the telescope and radial - velocity spectrometer .",
    "i thank jim hesser , chad hogan , les saddlemyer , and andy woodsworth for contributing observations to this project over the years .",
    "i also thank chris tout for very useful discussions .",

    "<S> after @xmath016 years of radial - velocity observations of a sample of 22 r - type carbon stars , no evidence for binary motion has been detected in any of them . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising considering that approximately 20% of normal late - type giants </S>",
    "<S> are spectroscopic binaries , and the fraction is close to 100% in barium , ch , and subgiant / dwarf ch and barium stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested , therefore , that a process that has caused the mixing of carbon to the surface of these stars can not act in a wide binary system . </S>",
    "<S> possibly , the r stars were once all binaries , but with separations that would not allow them to evolve completely up the giant and asymptotic giant branchs without coalescing . </S>",
    "<S> this coalescence may be the agent which causes carbon produced in the helium - core flash to be mixed outwards to a region where convection zones can bring it to the surface of the star . </S>"
