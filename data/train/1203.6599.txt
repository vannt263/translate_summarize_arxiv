    "in the last decade , search engines have become widely used indispensable tools for searching the web . for such engines ,",
    "it is essential that the search results not only consist of web pages related to the query terms , but also rank the pages properly so that the users quickly have access to the desired information .",
    "the pagerank algorithm at google is one of the successful algorithms that quantify and rank the importance of each web page .",
    "this algorithm was initially proposed in @xcite , and an overview can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of the pagerank algorithm is that it is based solely on the link structure inherent in the web .",
    "the underlying key idea is that links from important pages make a page more important .",
    "more concretely , each page is considered to be voting the pages to which it is linked .",
    "then , in the ranking of a page , the total number of votes as well as the importance of the voters are reflected .",
    "this problem is mathematically formulated as finding the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of a certain stochastic matrix associated with the web structure .    for the pagerank computation ,",
    "a critical aspect is the size of the web .",
    "the web is said to be composed of over 8 billion pages , and its size is still growing . currently , the computation is performed centrally at google , where the data on the whole web structure is collected by crawlers automatically browsing the web . in practice ,",
    "the class of algorithms that can be applied is limited .",
    "in fact , the basic power method is employed , but it is reported that this computation takes about a week @xcite .",
    "this clearly necessitates more efficient computational methods .    in this regard ,",
    "several approaches have recently been proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "an adaptive computation method is developed , which classifies web pages into groups based on the speed of convergence to the pagerank values and allocates computational resources accordingly .",
    "another line of research is based on distributed approaches , where the computation is performed on multiple servers communicating to each other .",
    "for example , monte carlo methods are used in @xcite , while the work in @xcite utilizes the block structure of the web to apply techniques from the markov chain literature . in @xcite , methods based on the so - called asynchronous iterations @xcite in numerical analysis are discussed .    in this paper , we follow the distributed approach and , in particular , develop a randomized algorithm for the pagerank computation ; for recent advances on probabilistic approaches in systems and control , see @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is fully distributed and has three main features as follows : first , in principle , each page can compute its own pagerank value locally by communicating with the pages that are connected by direct links .",
    "that is , each page exchanges its value with the pages that it is linked to and those linked to it .",
    "second , the pages make the decision to initiate this communication at random times which are independent from page to page .",
    "this means that , in its implementation , there is neither a fixed order among the pages nor a centralized agent in the web that determines the pages to update their values .",
    "third , the computation required for each page is very mild .",
    "the main result of the paper shows that the algorithm converges to the true pagerank values in the mean - square sense .",
    "this is achieved by computing the time average at each page . from a technical viewpoint ,",
    "an important characteristic of the approach is that the stochasticity of the matrix in the original problem is preserved and exploited .",
    "we first propose a basic distributed update scheme for the pages and then extend this into two directions to enhance its performance and flexibility for implementation .",
    "it is further noted that in @xcite , this approach has been generalized to incorporate failures in the communication as well as aggregation of the web structure . in @xcite , a related result on finding the variations in the pagerank values when the web data may contain errors",
    "is given .",
    "we emphasize that the approach proposed here is particularly motivated by the recent research on distributed consensus , agreement , and flocking problems in the systems and control community ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for additional details , we refer to @xcite . among such problems , our approach to pagerank computation",
    "is especially related to the consensus , where multiple agents exchange their values with neighboring agents so that they obtain consensus , i.e. , all agents reach the same value .",
    "the objective is clearly different from that of the pagerank problem , which is to find a specific eigenvector of a stochastic matrix via the power method .",
    "however , the recursion appearing in the consensus algorithm is exactly in the same form as the one for our distributed pagerank computation except that the class of stochastic matrices is slightly different .",
    "these issues will be discussed further .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : pagerank ] , we present an overview of the pagerank problem .",
    "the distributed approach is introduced in section  [ sec : dist1 ] , where we propose a basic scheme and prove its convergence .",
    "its relation with multi - agent consensus problems is discussed in section  [ sec : consensus ] .",
    "we then develop two extensions of the basic distributed algorithm : one in section  [ sec : simul ] is to improve the rate of convergence by allowing multiple pages to simultaneously update and the other in section  [ sec : approx ] to reduce the communication load among the pages .",
    "the proposed algorithm is compared with an approach known as asynchronous iteration from the field of numerical analysis in section  [ sec : asynch ] .",
    "numerical examples are given in section  [ sec : example ] to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "part of the material of this paper has appeared in a preliminary form in @xcite .",

    "a probability vector is a nonnegative vector @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "unless otherwise specified , by a stochastic matrix , we refer to a column - stochastic matrix , i.e. , a nonnegative matrix @xmath10 with the property that @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",

    "we denote by @xmath18 the vector containing the absolute values of the corresponding entries of @xmath19 .",
    "the norm @xmath20 for vectors is the euclidean norm . the spectral radius of the matrix @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "we use @xmath22 for the identity matrix .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief introductory description of the pagerank problem ; this material can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .    consider a network of @xmath23 web pages indexed by integers from 1 to @xmath23 .",
    "this network is represented by the directed graph @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 is the set of vertices corresponding to the web page indices while @xmath26 is the set of edges representing the links among the pages .",
    "the vertex @xmath27 is connected to the vertex @xmath28 by an edge , i.e. , @xmath29 , if page @xmath27 has an outgoing link to page @xmath28 , or in other words , page @xmath28 has an incoming link from page @xmath27 . to avoid trivial situations , we assume @xmath30 .    the objective of the pagerank algorithm is to provide some measure of importance to each web page .",
    "the pagerank value , or simply the value , of page @xmath31 is a real number in @xmath32 $ ] ; we denote this by @xmath33 .",
    "the values are ordered such that @xmath34 implies that page @xmath27 is more important than page @xmath28 .",
    "the basic idea in ranking the pages in terms of the values is that a page having links from important pages is also important .",
    "this is realized by determining the value of one page as a sum of the contributions from all pages that have links to it .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath33 of page @xmath27 is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , i.e. , this is the index set of pages linked to page @xmath27 , and @xmath37 is the number of outgoing links of page @xmath28 .",
    "it is customary to normalize the total of all values so that @xmath38 .",
    "let the values be in the vector form as @xmath39^n$ ] .",
    "then , from what we described so far , the pagerank problem can be restated as @xmath40^n,~~\\sum_{i=1}^n x^*_i = 1 , \\label{eqn : xa : pr}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath41 , called the link matrix , is given by @xmath42 note that the value vector @xmath43 is a nonnegative unit eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 of the nonnegative matrix @xmath44 . in general",
    ", for this eigenvector to exist and to be unique , it is sufficient that the web as a graph is strongly connected @xcite , there is a sequence of edges which connects @xmath27 to @xmath28 . in terms of the link matrix @xmath44 , strong connectivity of the graph",
    "is equivalent to @xmath44 being irreducible . ] .",
    "however , the web is known not to be strongly connected .",
    "thus , the problem is slightly modified as follows .",
    "first , note that in the real web , the so - called dangling nodes , which are pages having no links to others , are abundant .",
    "such pages can be found , e.g. , in the form of pdf document files having no outgoing links .",
    "these pages introduce zero columns into the link matrix . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we redefine the graph and thus the matrix @xmath44 by bringing in artificial links for all dangling nodes ( e.g. , links back to the pages having links to a dangling node ) . as a result",
    ", the link matrix @xmath44 becomes a stochastic matrix , that is , @xmath45 for each @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that there exists at least one eigenvalue equal to 1 .    to emphasize the changes in the links that we have just made , we state the following as an assumption .",
    "the link matrix @xmath44 given in is a stochastic matrix .",
    "next , to guarantee the uniqueness of the eigenvalue 1 , a modified version of the values has been introduced in @xcite as follows : let @xmath46 be a parameter such that @xmath47 , and let the modified link matrix @xmath48 be defined by @xmath49 in the original algorithm in @xcite , a typical value for @xmath46 is chosen as @xmath50 ; we use this value throughout this paper . as shown later in , however , large @xmath46 has the effect of faster convergence in the computation while it can also average out the pagerank values . ] .",
    "notice that @xmath51 is a positive stochastic matrix . by the perron theorem @xcite ,",
    "this matrix is primitive is said to be primitive if it is irreducible and has only one eigenvalue of maximum modulus . ] ; in particular , the eigenvalue 1 is of multiplicity  1 and is the unique eigenvalue of maximum modulus ( i.e. , with the maximum absolute value ) .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding eigenvector is positive .",
    "hence , we redefine the value vector @xmath43 by using @xmath51 in place of @xmath44 in as follows .",
    "the pagerank value vector @xmath43 is given by @xmath52^n,~~\\sum_{i=1}^n x^*_i = 1 .",
    "\\label{eqn : prvec}\\ ] ]    as mentioned in the introduction , due to the large dimension of the link matrix @xmath51 , the computation of the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 is difficult .",
    "the solution that has been employed in practice is based on the power method .",
    "that is , the value vector @xmath43 is computed through the recursion @xmath53 where @xmath54 and the initial vector @xmath55 is a probability vector . the second equality above follows from the fact @xmath56 , @xmath57 . for implementation ,",
    "the form on the far right - hand side is important , exhibiting that multiplication is required using only the sparse matrix @xmath44 , and not the dense matrix @xmath51 .",
    "based on this method , we can asymptotically find the value vector as shown below ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    in the update scheme , for any initial state @xmath58 that is a probability vector",
    ", it holds that @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "we now comment on the convergence rate of this scheme .",
    "denote by @xmath61 and @xmath62 the largest and the second largest eigenvalues of @xmath51 in magnitude .",
    "then , for the power method applied to @xmath51 , the asymptotic rate of convergence is exponential and depends on the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath51 is a positive stochastic matrix , we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in @xcite that the structure of the link matrix @xmath51 leads us to the bound @xmath66    we next provide a simple example for illustration .",
    "+    [ ex:1]consider the web with four pages shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4nodes ] . as a graph , this web",
    "is strongly connected , and there are no dangling nodes .",
    "the link matrix @xmath44 and the modified link matrix @xmath51 can easily be constructed by and , respectively , as @xmath67 where we used the value @xmath50 from @xcite .",
    "then , the value vector @xmath43 can be computed as @xmath68^t$ ] .",
    "notice that page 2 has the largest value since it is linked from three pages while page 1 , which has only one link to it , has the smallest value .",
    "on the other hand , pages 3 and 4 have the same number of incoming links , but page 4 has a larger value .",
    "this is because page 4 has more outgoing links , and thus it receives more contribution from page 3 than what it gives back .",
    "in this section , we propose a distributed approach to compute the value vector @xmath43 .",
    "consider the web from the previous section .",
    "the basic protocol of the scheme is as follows : at time @xmath69 , page @xmath27 initiates its pagerank value update ( i ) by sending the value of page @xmath27 to the pages that are linked and ( ii ) by requesting the values from the pages that are linked to page @xmath27 .",
    "all pages involved in this process renew their values based on the latest available information .    to implement the scheme in a distributed manner",
    ", we assume that the pages taking the update action are determined in a random manner .",
    "this is specified by the random process @xmath70 , @xmath57 .",
    "if at time @xmath69 , @xmath71 , then page @xmath27 initiates an update action by communicating and exchanging the values with the pages connected by incoming and outgoing links .",
    "specifically , @xmath72 is assumed to be i.i.d . , and its probability distribution is given by @xmath73 this means that each page takes the update action with equal probability . in principle , this scheme may be implemented without requiring a centralized decision maker or any fixed order among the pages .",
    "in particular , consider the distributed update scheme in the following form : @xmath74 where @xmath54 is the state",
    "whose initial state @xmath58 is a probability vector , @xmath75 is the mode of the system , and @xmath76 , @xmath3 , are called the distributed link matrices and are to be determined ; @xmath77 is a parameter replacing @xmath46 in the centralized scheme .",
    "the first step in the development is to introduce the distributed link matrices . for each @xmath27 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath84 is obtained as follows : ( i ) the @xmath27th row and column coincide with those of @xmath44 ; ( ii ) the remaining diagonal entries are equal to @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ; and ( iii ) all the remaining entries are zero .",
    "more formally , we have @xmath88 it follows that these matrices are stochastic because the original link matrix @xmath44 possesses this property . as we shall see later , this property indeed is critical for the convergence of the scheme .",
    "[ ex:3]we continue with the 4-page web in example  [ ex:1 ] .",
    "the link matrices @xmath76 are given by @xmath89    to clarify the properties of the link matrices @xmath76 just introduced , we consider the simpler update scheme @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the state with @xmath58 being a probability vector , and the mode @xmath72 is specified in . in particular , we focus on its average dynamics .",
    "the mean @xmath92 $ ] of the state @xmath91 follows the recursion @xmath93 , where @xmath94 $ ] is the average matrix and @xmath95 $ ] is the expectation with respect to the random process @xmath72 .",
    "hence , we now inspect this matrix @xmath96 . due to the probability distribution of @xmath72 in",
    ", we have @xmath97 it is obvious that @xmath96 is a stochastic matrix since all @xmath76 are stochastic .",
    "the following lemma shows some properties of this matrix @xmath96 that will be useful later .",
    "[ lem : abar]for the average matrix @xmath96 given in , we have the following :    1 .",
    "2 .   there exists a vector @xmath99 which is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 for both matrices @xmath44 and @xmath96 .",
    "( ii )  from ( i ) , we have @xmath103 .",
    "this implies that every eigenvector @xmath104 of the link matrix @xmath44 associated with the eigenvalue 1 is also an eigenvector of the average matrix @xmath96 for the same eigenvalue .",
    "the lemma above provides some justification for the proposed distributed approach .",
    "that is , even though the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath96 have different structures , they share an eigenvector for the eigenvalue 1 , which corresponds to the pagerank vector .      as in the case with the original link matrix @xmath44 , for the average matrix @xmath96 , the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 may not be unique .",
    "we follow an argument similar to that in section  [ sec : pagerank ] and introduce the modified versions of the distributed link matrices .",
    "since the link matrices @xmath76 are stochastic , we can rewrite the distributed update scheme in as @xmath105 where the modified distributed link matrices are given by @xmath106 this expression is derived by the relation @xmath56 because @xmath91 in is a probability vector for each @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath107 are positive stochastic matrices .",
    "similarly to the argument on the link matrices @xmath76 above , the problem at this second step is as follows : we shall find the modified link matrices @xmath107 by choosing the parameter @xmath78 such that their average and the link matrix @xmath51 from share an eigenvector for the eigenvalue 1 .",
    "since such an eigenvector is unique for @xmath51 , it is necessarily equal to the value vector @xmath43 ( see ) .",

    "a simple way of defining @xmath107 would be to let @xmath113 as in the case with @xmath51 ; however , it can be shown that there is no clear relation between the original matrix @xmath51 and the average matrix @xmath111 such as that between @xmath44 and @xmath96 as we have seen in lemma  [ lem : abar ] . instead",

    "the eigenvalue 1 is simple and is the unique eigenvalue of maximum modulus .",

    "hence , @xmath111 and @xmath51 share an eigenvector for the eigenvalue 1 . however , both @xmath111 and @xmath51 are positive stochastic matrices . therefore , by the perron theorem @xcite",
    ", for these matrices , the eigenvalue 1 is of multiplicity 1 and is the unique one having the maximum magnitude .",
    "moreover , by , the corresponding eigenvector coincides with @xmath43 .    from ( iii ) in the lemma",
    "above , it follows that the value vector @xmath43 can be obtained by the power method , i.e. , by the average system in as @xmath123 , @xmath60 .",
    "hence , in an average sense , the distributed update scheme asymptotically provides the correct values .",
    "it is interesting to observe that this can be achieved though the original link matrix @xmath44 does not explicitly appear in the scheme .",
    "in fact , an eigenvector of the matrix @xmath51 is computed through randomly switching among the distributed link matrices @xmath107 .    however , this property turns out not to be sufficient to guarantee convergence of @xmath91 to the true value @xmath43 . from lemma  [",
    "lem : taum](ii ) in the appendix , we can show that for any sequence @xmath124 , there exists a sequence of probability vectors @xmath125 such that , for any @xmath58 , it holds that @xmath126 as @xmath60 .",
    "the vector @xmath127 and hence the state @xmath19 in general do not converge .",

    "therefore , in the distributed approach , we resort to computing the time average @xmath79 of the states .",
    "the following theorem is the main result of this section .",

    "as can be seen in , the link matrices @xmath76 are sparse .",
    "thus , at time @xmath69 , communication is required only among the pages corresponding to the nonzero entries in @xmath133 .",
    "each page then performs weighted addition of its own value , the values just received , and the extra term @xmath134 .",
    "consequently , the amount of computation required at each page is limited at any time .",
    "implementation issues such as how web pages can exactly make local computations are outside the scope of this paper .",
