    "topological insulators ( tis ) are currently on the research front of condensed matter physics , because of their fundamental interest and potential applications in spintronic devices  @xcite . two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis",
    "are also called the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) systems , as they can host the interesting qsh effect , in which quantized spin current or spin accumulation can be generated in response to an applied electric field .",
    "a qsh system is an insulator in the bulk with a pair of conducting gapless edge states traversing the bulk band gap  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the edge states has its origin in the nontrivial bulk topological properties , which are usually characterized by the @xmath1 index  @xcite or spin chern numbers  @xcite , but their gapless nature is protected by the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry . while the nondissipative electronic transport through the edge modes is immune to nonmagnetic disorder , the edge states will become gapped and anderson localized in the presence of tr - symmetry - breaking perturbations  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the qsh effect is often unstable in realistic environments . up to now",
    ", conductance through edge channels near the theoretically predicted quantized value has been detected only in small samples of hgte quantum wells  @xcite and inas / gasb bilayers  @xcite . realizing qsh effect that is as robust as the conventional quantum hall effect is still challenging .",
    "recently , it was numerically demonstrated that the @xmath0 qsh effect driven by an @xmath0 electric field is fundamentally different from the intensively researched @xmath2 qsh effect  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath2 qsh effect , which must be carried by edge states , the @xmath0 qsh effect can occur in the bulk without involving the fragile edge states , hence being robust against tr - symmetry breaking and disorder .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 spin - dependent electronic transport has started to capture attention in recent years , stimulating the emerging field of @xmath0 spintronics .",
    "jiao and bauer theoretically predicted that the much larger @xmath0 voltage could be used to detect spin currents in the spin pumping transport  @xcite .",
    "wei @xmath3 @xmath4 found experimentally that the @xmath0 spin current is much larger than the @xmath2 component in a ferromagnet - normal junction with time - dependent magnetization vector  @xcite .    in this paper , we show that the basic characteristics of the low - frequency @xmath0 qsh effect can be described by a simple analytical theory based on the time - dependent scattering matrix formalism .",
    "the @xmath0 spin hall conductivity in the adiabatic regime is linked to the winding numbers of the reflection matrices in the electrodes , which also equal to the spin chern numbers of the qsh material .",
    "the theoretical result is consistent with the numerical calculation based upon the kubo linear - response theory  @xcite .",
    "our theory indicates that while the @xmath0 and @xmath2 qsh effects behave quite differently , they share the same topological origin .",
    "we further show that when ferromagnetic metals are used as electrodes , the topological @xmath0 spin current will induce an electrical voltage difference along the electrodes , suggesting a possible experimental way to observe the @xmath0 qsh effect by electrical means .    in the next section",
    ", we present a general theoretical description of the @xmath0 qsh effect based on the scattering matrix formula . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the bhz model as a concrete example , and evaluate the the winding numbers and spin hall conductivity . in sec .",
    "iv , a possible way to measure the @xmath0 spin hall conductivity experimentally is proposed .",
    "the final section contains a summary .",
    "let us consider the setup illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "two metallic bars ( blue ) are deposited on top of a qsh sample . when an @xmath0 electric voltage difference is applied to the bars",
    ", an @xmath0 electric field @xmath5 is established between the bars , and in response , a hall spin current @xmath6 is generated in the biased region .",
    "two metallic gates ( red ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are deposited between the bars near the edges of the biased region , which serve as source and drain electrodes for the hall spin current . to facilitate our general discussion , we assume that the @xmath0 electric field also exists in the electrodes . this assumption does not change the topological properties of the system , and will not affect the main conclusion .",
    "the sizes of the biased region and electrodes are taken to be sufficiently large , so that we can neglect any finite - size effects . as a result",
    ", the hamiltonian of the system of the biased region and electrodes takes the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the 2d momentum , where @xmath12 is an operator , and @xmath13 is a good quantum number .",
    "@xmath14 is the vector potential of the @xmath0 electric field @xmath5 . in the biased region",
    ", @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of the qsh material with a band gap , while in the electrodes , it represents the hamiltonian of a metal .",
    "the remaining region of the qsh sample , which is neither excited by the @xmath0 electric field nor in contact with the electrodes , will behave just like an ordinary insulator  @xcite , and so is not included into the hamiltonian .",
    "qsh effect .",
    "two metal bars ( blue ) are deposited on top of a 2d qsh material . when an @xmath0 electrical voltage is applied to the metal bars , an electric field @xmath15",
    "will be generated in the @xmath16 direction . in response ,",
    "an @xmath0 hall spin current @xmath6 is created along the @xmath17 direction .",
    "two metal gates ( red ) with length @xmath18 , i.e. , gates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are deposited near the two edges of the biased region as source and drain electrodes for the spin current .",
    "we first assume the electrodes to be nonmagnetic .",
    "later , we will show that if ferromagnetic metals are used as the electrodes , an @xmath0 electric voltage difference @xmath19 can be induced between the inside edges of the two electrodes , suggesting a possible way to detect the @xmath0 qsh effect electrically . , width=268 ]    the electron fermi energy is set to be in the band gap of the qsh material .",
    "we consider first the ideal case , where the electron spin is conserved .",
    "we focus on the right electrode , and the situation in the left electrode is similar . let @xmath20 be the reflection matrix for an electron with spin @xmath21 ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) at the fermi level transmitting from the electrode toward the biased region . in the adiabatic regime , the spin current density pumped into the electrode at time @xmath24 can be evaluated by using the scattering matrix formula  @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 as the cross - section of the biased region .",
    "we notice that the reflection matrices depend on @xmath24 only through the variable @xmath10 , such that @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . by using these relations and replacing the summation over @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ spinjs1 ] ) by an integral , we derive the @xmath0 spin hall conductivity , defined as @xmath29 , to be @xmath30 where @xmath31    since",
    "the electron fermi energy is in the band gap of the qsh material , an electron incident from the electrode will be fully reflected , and the reflection matrices must be unitary , i.e. , @xmath32 . besides , they are periodic functions of @xmath13 in a brillouin zone . as a result , one can identify immediately @xmath33 as winding numbers , which are always integers .",
    "therefore , while the spin hall conductivity @xmath34 is defined as the ratio between two time - dependent quantities , i.e. , the @xmath0 spin current @xmath6 and @xmath0 electric field @xmath15 , it is integer - quantized at any time , in units of the spin conductivity quantum @xmath35 , in the adiabatic regime . very often ,",
    "continuous models are employed in theoretical works . in a well - defined continuous model",
    ", the electron wavefunctions should be continuous in the @xmath36 limit , which implies @xmath37 under this condition , @xmath33 remain to be integer - quantized . in the example",
    "considered later , we will see that @xmath33 in fact equal to the spin chern numbers of the qsh system .",
    "when small spin - mixing perturbations , such as the rashba spin - orbit coupling , are present , spin - flip reflection processes will occur with small probabilities , and the @xmath0 spin hall conductivity will deviate from the integer - quantized value in a gradual manner , similarly to the @xmath2 qsh effect .",
    "we need to point out that the @xmath0 hall spin current originates from the time dependence of the hamiltonian caused by the @xmath0 applied electric field , as clearly indicated by eq .",
    "( [ spinjs1 ] ) .",
    "one might think that by taking the limit @xmath38 , the conclusion for the @xmath0 qsh effect should be applicable to the @xmath2 qsh effect , which is not true .",
    "for an exactly static electric field ( @xmath39 ) , since one can choose an electrostatic scalar potential to make the hamiltonian independent of time , no spin current can be generated in the setup shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the @xmath2 qsh effect must be carried by the edge states .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 qsh effect is substantially different from the @xmath2 qsh effect .",
    "moreover , the above general discussion about the @xmath0 qsh effect does not rely on any symmetries , which is also different from the @xmath2 qsh effect .",
    "small tr - symmetry - breaking perturbations will open an energy gap in the spectrum of the edge states in a qsh material , and the edge states become exponentially localized immediately due to their one - dimensional nature . as a consequence , the @xmath2 qsh effect will be destroyed for sufficiently large samples .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 qsh effect is a bulk transport phenomenon , being robust against tr - symmetry breaking and disorder  @xcite .",
    "as a concrete example , we consider the bhz model , which can be used to describe the hgte quantum wells  @xcite or inas / gasb bilayers  @xcite .",
    "the bhz model hamiltonian reads @xmath40 here , we retain the @xmath41 term with @xmath42 , as it ensures that the condition eq .",
    "( [ limcond ] ) is fulfilled , and the topological properties of the system are properly defined .",
    "in fact , the spin chern numbers of this model , given by @xmath43 $ ]  @xcite , are dependent of @xmath8 .",
    "other nonessential nonlinear terms of momentum in the original model have been neglected for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath0 qsh effect , as a topological transport phenomenon , is insensitive to the material details of the electrodes .",
    "we model the electrodes by using a simple parabolic hamiltonian @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is taken to be large compared with all other energy scales , so as to guarantee that the electrodes have sufficient number of conducting channels for the spin current to flow through .",
    "finite potential barriers of height @xmath46 and thickness @xmath47 exist at the interfaces between the qsh material and electrodes , similar to the setup considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . by following the same procedure detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , linearizing the hamiltonians of both the qsh material and electrodes with respect to @xmath48 , one can obtain for the reflection coefficients @xmath49}{\\mbox{ch}(\\gamma_{0}d)-\\sin(\\theta ) \\mbox{sh}(\\gamma_{0}d)}\\ , \\label{rupup0}\\ ] ] and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 $ ] .    for the present model , the reflection matrix @xmath20 is simply a number , satisfying @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , with changing @xmath13 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , @xmath56 keeps traveling on the unit circle around the origin on the complex plane , and forms a closed orbit due to single - value condition eq .",
    "( [ limcond ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 defined in eq .",
    "( [ wind ] ) is the winding number of the closed orbit around the origin . for convenience ,",
    "the winding number may also be expressed as @xmath57\\ , \\label{wind2}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the argument of @xmath56 . in the absence of the potential barrier ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath59 , the reflection amplitude eq .",
    "( [ rupup0 ] ) reduces to @xmath60 .",
    "the winding number can be determined by tracking how the argument @xmath58 of @xmath56 evolves with changing @xmath13 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we plot four different representative behaviors of @xmath61 . for simplicity",
    ", we have chosen the unit set , where @xmath62 . from fig .",
    "2(a ) , we see that if @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath61 increments @xmath65 with varying @xmath13 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath61 decrements @xmath65 . in the other cases , where @xmath63 and @xmath67 , or @xmath66 and @xmath64 , @xmath61 does not change",
    "the behaviors of @xmath68 can be analyzed similarly .",
    "consequently , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ wind2 ] ) the following expression for the winding numbers @xmath69\\equiv c_{\\uparrow(\\downarrow)}\\ . \\label{bhz_wind}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] interestingly , the winding numbers are exactly equal to the spin chern numbers of the bhz model .",
    "as expected , the @xmath0 spin hall conductivity is integer - quantized , @xmath70\\frac{e}{4\\pi}\\equiv(c_{\\uparrow}-c_{\\downarrow } ) \\frac{e}{4\\pi}$ ] , which is consistent with the numerical result calculated from the kubo theory at low frequencies  @xcite .",
    "this relation indicates that while the @xmath0 and @xmath2 qsh effects behave quite differently , they share the same topological origin .",
    ", as a function of @xmath71 , for ( a ) four different sets of @xmath72 , and ( b ) four sets of @xmath73 .",
    "the other parameters are taken to be @xmath74 , and ( a ) @xmath75 , ( b ) @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    ", width=268 ]    for a nonvanishing potential barrier , i.e. , @xmath78 , the condition @xmath53 is still satisfied .",
    "this means that with changing @xmath13 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , the reflection amplitudes @xmath56 always move on the unit circle around the origin on the complex plane . as a result ,",
    "the winding numbers can not change values with changing @xmath79 .",
    "in other words , eq .  ( [ bhz_wind ] ) remains valid for a nonvanishing potential barrier . here , based upon the same topological argument",
    ", we may also get some insight into why the @xmath0 spin hall conductivity @xmath29 is integer - quantized , being independent of time . at a given time @xmath24 ,",
    "the system hamiltonian @xmath80 has some small deformation from @xmath81 .",
    "as long as the difference @xmath82 is not large enough to close the band gap , the winding numbers and spin hall conductivity are unchangeable . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we plot the argument @xmath61 of @xmath83 for some different sets of @xmath79 and @xmath84 in the case @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we see that while its curve deforms with changing @xmath79 or @xmath84 , @xmath61 always increments @xmath65 , independent of the barrier strength or time . for essentially the same reason , it is easy to understand that whether the @xmath0 electric field exists in the electrode does not affect the expressions for the winding numbers and @xmath0 spin hall conductivity .",
    "the winding numbers may change values , only if the bulk band gap in the qsh material closes . in this case , the condition @xmath53 of full reflection no longer holds , and the trajectories of @xmath85 can sweep across the origin on the complex plane , which leads to a change in the winding numbers , signaling a topological phase transition .    similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , one can also include the rashba spin - orbit coupling into @xmath86 , and find that it leads to small deviation of the spin hall conductivity from the integer - quantized value , in the second order of @xmath87 with @xmath88 as the strength of the rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "now we propose a method to experimentally measure the @xmath0 spin hall conductivity by electrical means .",
    "for the same setup shown in fig .  1 , we suggest to use ferromagnetic metals as gates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with their magnetic moments aligned along the @xmath89 axis .",
    "the ferromagnets are assumed to have a length @xmath18 , in the @xmath17 direction , much greater than the spin diffusion length @xmath90 . as demonstrated above",
    ", the spin current generated is topological and insensitive to the material parameters of the electrodes .",
    "when the @xmath0 electric field @xmath15 is applied , a pure @xmath0 spin current density @xmath91 will flow out of the source electrode and into the drain electrode .",
    "the principle of the proposed method can be explained as follows .",
    "the amplitude of the spin current decays into the electrodes within about a spin diffusion length @xmath90 , and its spin - up and spin - down components recombine to cancel each other",
    ". since the majority - spin and minority - spin bands of a ferromagnet have different 2d conductivities , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the voltage drops ( strictly speaking , drops of the electrochemical potential ) in the two spin channels caused by the spin current are not equal in magnitudes , giving rise to a net @xmath0 electric voltage drop . if the voltages at the outside edges of the ferromagnetic electrodes are made equal through grounding or short - circuiting , as shown in fig .  1",
    ", a voltage difference @xmath19 will appear between the inner edges of the electrodes , which can be measured by using an @xmath0 voltage meter .    to calculate the voltage difference",
    ", we employ the semiclassical spin diffusion equation for a ferromagnetic metal , which can be written as  @xcite @xmath94 here , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the electron non - spin - flip and spin - flip relaxation times , @xmath98 is the spin - dependent electrochemical potential for spin - up ( @xmath99 ) and spin - down ( @xmath100 ) electrons , respectively , and @xmath101 is the fermi velocity in the ferromagnets . the usually small spin dependence in the fermi velocity has been neglected  @xcite . the spin - dependent electrical current is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the drude conductivity .",
    "we consider first the drain electrode @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", the topological pure spin current @xmath104 flows from the qsh material into the the electrode .",
    "the boundary condition at the left edge @xmath105 of the electrode is given by @xmath106 while that at the right edge @xmath107 reads @xmath108 since the right edge is grounded . from eqs .",
    "( [ diffuseeq])-([bound2 ] ) , one can readily obtain for the spin - dependent electrochemical potential @xmath109 @xmath110 with @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath90 is the spin - diffusion length .",
    "the electric voltage @xmath113 in the ferromagnet is the average of spin up and down chemical potentials , @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "the electric voltage in gate @xmath7 can be solved similarly .",
    "we find that the electric voltage at the right edge of gate @xmath7 is equal to that at the left edge of gate @xmath8 in magnitude , but with an opposite sign . as a result ,",
    "the electric voltage difference between the two inside edges of gates @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xmath115 , which can be derived to be @xmath116 here , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the majority - spin and minority - spin conductivities , as mentioned above .",
    "therefore , by measuring the electric voltage difference @xmath19 , the spin hall conductivity @xmath117 can be determined .",
    "in summary , we have developed an analytical theory of the @xmath0 qsh effect by using the time - dependent scattering matrix method .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 spin current flowing from the qsh material into an electrode is linked to the winding numbers of the reflection matrix of the electrode , which also equal to the spin chern numbers of the qsh system .",
    "the @xmath0 qsh effect is a bulk transport phenomenon , being substantially different from its @xmath2 counterpart , which relies on the existence of symmetry - protected gapless edge states . a possible way to observe the @xmath0 qsh effect",
