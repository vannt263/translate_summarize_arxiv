    "many fields such as high - energy astrophysics etc . may involve flows at speeds close to the speed of light or influenced by large gravitational potentials such that the relativistic effect should be taken into account .",
    "relativistic flows appear in numerous astrophysical phenomena , from stellar to galactic scales , e.g. super - luminal jets , gamma - ray bursts , core collapse super - novae , coalescing neutron stars , formation of black holes and so on .",
    "the governing equations of the relativistic hydrodynamics ( rhd ) are highly nonlinear so that their analytical treatment is extremely difficult . a primary and powerful approach to understand the physical mechanisms in rhds",
    "is numerical simulations .",
    "the pioneering numerical work may date back to the finite difference code by may and white with the artificial viscosity technique for spherically symmetric general rhd equations in the lagrangian coordinate @xcite .",
    "wilson first attempted to numerically solve multi - dimensional rhd equations in the eulerian coordinate by using the finite difference method with the artificial viscosity technique @xcite , which was systematically introduced in @xcite . since 1990s",
    ", the numerical study of the rhds began to attract considerable attention , and various modern shock - capturing methods based on exact or approximate riemann solvers have been developed for the rhd equations , the readers are referred to the early review articles @xcite and more recent works on numerical methods for the rhd equations in @xcite .",
    "recently , second - order accurate direct eulerian generalized riemann problem ( grp ) schemes were developed for both 1d and 2d special rhd equations @xcite and the third - order accurate extension to the 1d case was also presented in @xcite .",
    "the grp scheme , as an analytic high - order accurate extension of the godunov method , was originally devised for non - relativistic compressible fluid dynamics @xcite , by utilizing a piecewise linear function to approximate the `` initial '' data and then analytically resolving a local grp at each interface to yield numerical flux , see the comprehensive description in @xcite .",
    "there exist two versions of the original grp scheme : the lagrangian and eulerian . the eulerian version is always derived by using the lagrangian framework with a transformation , which is quite delicate , particularly for the sonic case and multi - dimensional application .",
    "to avoid those difficulties , second - order accurate direct eulerian grp schemes were respectively developed for the shallow water equations @xcite , the euler equations @xcite , and a more general weakly coupled system @xcite by directly resolving the local grps in the eulerian formulation via the riemann invariants and rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .",
    "a recent comparison of the grp scheme with the gas - kinetic scheme showed the good performance of the grp solver for some inviscid flow simulations @xcite .",
    "combined with the moving mesh method @xcite , the adaptive direct eulerian grp scheme was developed in @xcite with improved resolution as well as accuracy . the accuracy and performance of the adaptive grp scheme",
    "were further studied in @xcite in simulating 2d complex wave configurations formulated with the 2d riemann problems of non - relativistic euler equations .",
    "recently , the adaptive grp scheme was also extended to unstructured triangular meshes @xcite .",
    "the third - order accurate extensions of the direct eulerian grp scheme were studied for 1d and 2d non - relativistic euler equations in @xcite and the general 1d hyperbolic balance laws in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the paper is to develop a second - order accurate direct eulerian grp scheme for spherically symmetric general rhd equations .",
    "the traditional godunov - type schemes based on exact or approximate riemann solvers can be extended to the general rhd equations from the special rhd case through a local change of coordinates in terms of that the spacetime metric is locally minkowskian @xcite .",
    "similar idea can be found in developing the so - called locally inertial godunov method for spherically symmetric general rhd equations @xcite .",
    "however , such approach can not be used to develop the direct eulerian grp scheme for the general rhd equations , because it is necessary to resolve the local grp together with the local change of the metrics taken into account .",
    "moreover , the metrics should be approximately obtained at the cell interface by accurate scheme for the sse equations to keep the continuity of the approximate metric functions . in short , developing the grp scheme for the general rhd equations is not trivial and much more technical than the special relativistic case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : goeq ] introduces the governing equations of general rhds in spherically symmetric spacetime and corresponding riemann invariants as well as their total differentials .",
    "the second - order accurate direct eulerian grp scheme is developed in section [ sec : scheme ] .",
    "the outline of the scheme is first given in section [ sec : outline ] .",
    "then the local grps are analytically resolved in section [ sec : resolugrp ] , where sections [ sec : resolurare ] and [ sec : resolushock ] resolve the rarefaction and shock waves by using the riemann invariants and the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions , respectively , section [ sec : pupt ] concludes the the limiting values of the time derivatives of the conservative variables at the `` initial '' discontinuous point along the cell interface for both nonsonic and sonic cases , and section [ sec : acoustic ] discusses the acoustic case .",
