    "constraining the star formation and chemical evolution histories of galaxies is one of the fundamental goals in observational cosmology .",
    "the evolution of the global star formation rate ( sfr ) has to map the evolution over cosmic time of its products , i.e. the baryonic and metal content of the universe .",
    "the most direct way to constrain the star formation and chemical evolution history over cosmic times is to trace back galaxy properties ( star formation rate , metallicity , stellar mass ) through observations at different redshifts .",
    "several studies on the evolution of the rest - frame uv emission density of galaxies , converted into star formation or metal ejection rates , have converged into a picture in which the maximum of galaxy star formation activity occurs over the redshift range @xmath4 and declines sharply from @xmath5 towards the present @xcite . while several recent studies have built a consistent picture of the decline in cosmic star formation rate from @xmath61 to the present ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , more uncertain is the behaviour at redshift higher than 2 , because of the poor understanding of the effect of dust on the sfr derived from uv spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "a broad peak of high star formation over the redshift range @xmath7 and then a rapid decline toward the present are features predicted ( or reproduced ) also by both chemical evolution models @xcite and by semianalytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a complementary approach is to study the chemical and star formation history over cosmic times through the so - called ` fossil cosmology ' , i.e. determining the past history of the universe from its present contents .",
    "this approach has benefited from large spectroscopic surveys in the local universe , such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which provide detailed spectral information for hundreds of thousands of galaxies .",
    "based on such surveys , @xcite and @xcite have constrained the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) from the ` cosmic optical spectrum ' , which represents the average emission from all the objects in a representative volume of the universe and has the advantage of being fitted by simpler models of star formation histories than those needed for individual objects . @xcite and @xcite have applied a data compression algorithm ( moped , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to extract the sfh of @xmath8 sdss dr1 galaxies from their optical spectra .",
    "this work has been recently extended to the sdss dr3 ( three times larger sample ) by @xcite , with improvements both in the data and in the modelling sides ( see also tojeiro et al . 2007 , ocvirk et al .",
    "2006 and cid fernandes et al .",
    "2007 for similar methods to recover stellar content and star formation histories from galaxy spectra ) .",
    "this allowed them to derive the cosmic sfh from the ` fossil record ' and study it as a function of the present - day stellar mass of galaxies .",
    "the contribution to the global sfr by galaxies of different mass is being studied not only in the local universe but also at higher redshift .",
    "@xcite studied the dependence of the cosmic sfh directly on the stellar mass at the epoch of observation over the redshift range @xmath9 , based on a near - infrared selected sample from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , @xcite have quantified the decrease with redshift of the mass limit above which star formation appears to be quenched , based on a sample of more than 8000 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath10 drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "these results confirm those previously found by @xcite for @xmath11 .",
    "while high- and intermediate - mass galaxies have transitioned to a quiescent phase of star formation by @xmath12 , less massive systems dominate the star formation rate density till the present epoch .",
    "it appears , though , that the global star formation rate has been declining since @xmath61 for all galaxies populations , at a rate which is independent of stellar mass , as shown by @xcite estimating sfrs of @xmath1315000 combo-17 galaxies from uv and ir luminosities and accounting for individually ir - undetectable galaxies @xcite .",
    "an important consistency check for all these studies comes from the comparison of the density of stellar mass and of metals at different epochs expected from the cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories ( i.e. the integral of these histories ) with those directly measured .",
    "the evolution of the global stellar mass density out to @xmath14 has been first determined by @xcite . in concordance with estimates of the cosmic sfh",
    ", their study suggests that the redshift range @xmath15 is a critical epoch when galaxies are growing rapidly attaining their final stellar mass .",
    "much effort has been put also in measuring the chemical composition of galaxies at different epochs , through optical nebular emission lines studies at @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "all these studies have highlighted a shortfall of metals in observed galaxy populations with respect to expectations from the cosmic sfh , known as the ` missing metals ' problem at redshift around 2.5 @xcite .",
    "a large fraction could be hosted in a recently discovered population of sub - dlas @xcite .",
    "not more than @xmath19 percent seems to be in intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and probably @xmath20 percent of metals is still ` missing ' from the census @xcite .",
    "these metals are likely locked in the hot gas phase @xcite .",
    "the present - day distribution of metals is still highly uncertain , because little is known about the chemical composition of the possibly dominant baryonic component , the warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "however the fraction of metals contained in galaxies , in particular those locked into the stellar component , has increased from @xmath21 to the present , and is probably comparable to the fraction of metals outside galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in this work we focus on the baryonic and metal content of the stellar component of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "what is the total amount of metals and baryons locked up into stars by the present epoch ?",
    "what is the resulting average stellar metallicity of the present - day universe ? to address these questions we join together information about the stellar mass and chemical properties of present - day galaxies , supported by the large statistics provided by the sdss . the sample we analyse span large ranges in physical , spectral and morphological properties , and constitute in this sense a representative sample of the local universe",
    "this allows us also to study how metals and baryons are distributed among galaxies with different properties . in particular , we want to quantify the fraction of metals , in comparison to the fraction of baryons , locked up in galaxies as a function of their stellar mass , morphology and age .",
    "we exploit new estimates of physical parameters , such as stellar metallicity and stellar mass , that we previously derived ( * ? ? ?",

    "we include all galaxies types , from quiescent early - type to actively star - forming galaxies . in our previous works we focused only on galaxies with high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra , because of the poor constraints that can be obtained on stellar metallicity from low - s / n spectra .",
    "we circumvent here this problem by stacking individual spectra of low - s / n galaxies with similar properties in order to obtain high - s / n ( average ) spectra .",

    "in section  [ totalz ] we derive the mass density of baryons and of metals locked up in stars , expressed also in terms of the average stellar metallicity of the local universe .",
    "we then discuss several sources of systematic uncertainties in section  [ errors ] and compare with other estimates in the literature in section  [ literature ] .",
    "section  [ distrz ] provides an inventory of the stellar metallicity and stellar mass today , focusing on the characteristic age of the stellar mass and metallicity distributions in section  [ age ] .",
    "we compare the observed distributions of stellar mass and stellar metallicity with those predicted by the millennium simulation in section  [ millennium ] .",

    "we note that the sample analysed is defined on the dr2 coverage , but we use the photometric reduction of the dr4 release .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that we found a systematic difference of @xmath130.16  mag in the @xmath28-band model magnitudes for a subset of galaxies from one release to the other , which can affect the overall normalization of the stellar mass density . the spectroscopic measurements and",
    "fibre colours were instead consistent within the errors between releases .",

    "the comparison is based on five spectral absorption features , namely ,  and  as age - sensitive indices , and  and  as metal - sensitive indices , all of which have at most a weak dependence on element abundance ratios . after constructing the probability density function of age , metallicity and stellar mass for every galaxy ,",
    "the median of each likelihood distribution represents our estimate of the corresponding parameter , while half of the @xmath29 percent interpercentile range gives the associated @xmath30 ( gaussian - equivalent ) uncertainty . in this work",

    "the quality of the spectrum influences directly the uncertainties in the derived physical parameters , stellar metallicity being the most affected one : the average uncertainty on stellar metallicity decreases from 0.21  dex to 0.12  dex when high - s / n galaxies only are considered .",

    "@xmath31 satisfies the s / n requirement . excluding galaxies with @xmath32 we would therefore preferentially miss diffuse systems with potentially subsolar metallicity .",

    "n galaxies need to be considered as well .      in order to include low - s / n galaxies , in addition to the subsample with @xmath33 , we create composite high - s / n spectra by coadding the spectra of low - s / n galaxies with similar properties .",
    "first of all , we require galaxies to have similar velocity dispersion .",
    "the broadening due to stellar velocity dispersion affects the measured spectral absorption indices .",
    "when deriving physical parameters estimates we do not correct for this , instead each spectrum is compared only to those models in the library with velocity dispersion similar to the observed one .",
    "it is therefore important that the galaxies that contribute to each coadded spectrum span a range in velocity dispersion comparable to the observational error .",
    "moreover , metallicity , age and stellar mass all show correlations with velocity dispersion , absolute magnitude and  ( see e.g. figs  7,8 of paper  i and figs  6,10 of paper  ii for early - type galaxies ) .",
    "we thus choose to coadd the spectra of low - s / n galaxies with similar velocity dispersion , @xmath0-band absolute magnitude and 4000 - break . by binning into these quantities",
    "we are confident that the scatter in the physical parameters of the galaxies contributing to each stacked spectrum is small .",

    "our study has shown that the stellar metallicity and the stellar mass distributions do not differ significantly , in particular at the high - mass end .",
    "in other words , the galaxies that contribute most of the total amount of metals in stars have properties similar to those containing the bulk of the total mass in stars .    the typical galaxy in the present - day universe where baryons and metals reside has a concentration parameter of 2.7 ( indicating a disc and a significant bulge component ) , a @xmath379 , corresponding to a fairly old stellar age of @xmath136  gyr , and a stellar mass of @xmath380 .",
    "note that the characteristic mass found here is above the stellar mass of @xmath381 at which the transition from low - mass , metal - poor , disc - dominated galaxies to high - mass , metal - rich , bulge - dominated galaxies occurs .",
    "galaxies with masses greater than @xmath381 , where the mass - metallicity relation starts to flatten @xcite , contain more than 80 percent of the total amount of mass and metals in stars .",
    "the stellar metallicity and stellar mass distributions differ most significantly with respect to concentration and stellar age ( as indicated also by the colour and ) , in the sense that the relative contributions to the total stellar mass and to the total metallicity are reversed in late - type galaxies , compared to early - type galaxies ( morphologically or photometrically classified as such ) . separating galaxies on the basis of their concentration parameter",
    ", we find that bulge - dominated and disc - dominated galaxies provide the same fraction of the total mass in stars ( 30 or 50 percent depending on the cut in @xmath48 adopted ) . on the contrary , the contribution of disc - dominated galaxies to the mass density of metals is lower than that of bulge - dominated galaxies ( with the same cuts in concentration ) .",
    "for example , defining early - type galaxies as those having @xmath71 and late - types those having @xmath31 , the two classes of galaxies both contribute 30 percent to the stellar mass budget , but 40 and less than 25 percent respectively to the total metal budget in stars .",
    "similar considerations hold for the distributions as functions of colour or .",
    "we find that at least 50 up to 75 percent of the stellar mass ( and of the metals ) is locked into red - sequence galaxies ( depending on the assumed colour cut ) .",
    "these fractions are in good agreement with previous results from e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show that these observational distributions are physically translated into the corresponding distributions in age .",
    "more than 50 percent of the mass and the metals locked up in stars reside in galaxies with ages older than 6.3  gyr .",
    "it would be tempting to translate the characteristic age of the stellar populations contributing most of the metals and of the mass into a characteristic redshift of formation .",
    "unfortunately , this can not be done straightforwardly because our stellar ages are averages over all the stellar populations in a galaxy , weighted by mass or by light .",
    "thus they are very sensitive to the galaxy sfh and , on average , closer to the last significant episode of star formation . given the different timescales of star formation expected in galaxies with different mass , it is reasonable to look at the distributions of mass and metals against ( mass - weighted ) age for different stellar mass bins .",
    "this shows that most of the mass and metals come from galaxies older than a characteristic age which becomes progressively younger from massive to less massive galaxies .",
    "considering only massive galaxies ( @xmath382 ) at least 50 percent of the mass and metals is in systems older than 8.5  gyr , which would correspond to a redshift @xmath383 .",
    "this redshift is compatible with the redshift range @xmath384 at which the cosmic star formation rate density starts to decline ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the evidence that the bulk of star formation in massive galaxies has occurred at high redshifts , while low - mass galaxies are still in a phase of active star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although galaxies appear to experience the same rate of decline in their global star formation from @xmath61 to the present independently of mass @xcite .",
    "comparison of the observed distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with those predicted by the millennium simulation shows a good agreement in the distributions against stellar mass .",
    "however , an excess at low stellar masses ( roughly below @xmath385 ) is visible , which has been already pointed out in the luminosity or stellar mass functions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the agreement between our observations and the models becomes worse when mass - weighted age and stellar metallicity are considered .",
    "although successful in reproducing the general trend of increasing both age and metallicity with mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the models predict narrower ranges in these physical parameters than observed .    our study provides a new determination of the total amount of metals locked up in stars today and allows us for the first time to derive a quantitative and accurate description of the properties of the galaxies hosting different fractions of the metals and of the stellar mass in the local universe .",
    "such distributions represent important constraints on models of the cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories .",
    "the detailed knowledge of the distribution of metals , coupled to the stellar mass distribution , will allow a more direct comparison with predictions from semianalytic models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "ongoing large redshift surveys , like vvds @xcite , goods @xcite , deep2 @xcite , zcosmos @xcite , will make it possible to extend this kind of studies to redshifts as high as @xmath12 and thus , not only to build a more consistent picture of the cosmic star formation history , but also to understand which are the galaxies that most strongly contributed to its evolution since @xmath5 .",
