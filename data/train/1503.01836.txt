    "near - infrared ( nir ; @xmath10.8 - 2.5 @xmath0 m ) observations can provide a wealth of information addressing numerous outstanding questions about the physics and lifecycles of galaxies .",
    "many diagnostic lines are present in this wavelength range : h@xmath4 and coronal lines can be used to trace molecular gas and super - excited , often outflowing , material ; obscured broad line regions ( blrs ) can be revealed ; [ feii ] emission may probe shock - excited gas associated with supernova activity or jets ; and stellar absorption lines may measure stages of stellar evolution that have less obvious optical signatures , to name just a few examples .",
    "nir observations of inactive galaxies , starbursts , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have already given rise to advances in areas from stellar population studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ".    one topic of much recent interest is the contribution of thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars to the nir luminosity of galaxies .",
    "the complexity of this stage of stellar evolution , which occurs in stars of m@xmath5 at ages of @xmath10.3 - 2 gyr , makes it very difficult to model accurately ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the available observed spectra of single stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) span only a limited range of age and metallicity .",
    "whereas some models predict only weak spectral features and a minor contribution from tp - agb stars to the nir luminosity of a galaxy @xcite , others predict that these stars will cause strong molecular absorptions and contribute as much as 80% of the k band light @xcite .",
    "this can have a large effect on the stellar masses and stellar population ages derived from observations @xcite .",
    "distinguishing between these models is not straightforward : recent studies have come to very different conclusions regarding whether a large contribution from tp - agb stars is required @xcite or ruled out @xcite by observations of globular clusters , post - starburst galaxies , and high - redshift galaxies .",
    "high - quality nir spectra of galaxies can be used to search for the molecular absorption bands , such as cn , c@xmath4 , and h@xmath4o , expected from these stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "detailed investigations of these bands in nearby galaxies with a range of properties will aid the development of the models necessary to understand and predict the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies at z@xmath13 , at the age when their initial stellar population was producing large numbers of tp - agb stars .    towards the opposite end of the stellar luminosity range",
    ", it has been reported that the centers of elliptical galaxies contain an enhanced fraction of low - mass stars , indicating that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) may not be universal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relative numbers of high- and low - mass stars produced during an episode of star formation will affect the influence of the star - forming region on its surroundings , as well as determine the chemical evolution of a galaxy , making the stellar imf an important area of study .",
    "much of the evidence for a non - universal imf has come from studies of stellar absorption lines around 1 @xmath0 m , such as the 0.99 @xmath0 m wing - ford feh band which is stronger in dwarf stars than in giants .",
    "imf - sensitive features can also be found throughout the nir @xcite .",
    "modeling of the nir features , especially in conjunction with optical spectra to break the degeneracy between the effects of the imf and metallicity , may be used to infer the presence of a `` bottom - heavy '' imf , and perhaps also to constrain the overall shape of the imf of extragalactic stellar populations @xcite .    both stellar- and",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed sed studies suggest that the weak agn that exists in many liners can not supply sufficient ionizing photons to power the optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "other power sources must therefore contribute , such as jet or supernova shocks , or stellar photoionisation .",
    "@xcite were able to explain the nir [ fe ii ] 1.26 @xmath0m / pa@xmath6 ratio in several liners with an aging starburst model , and correlations between line emission and optical stellar surface brightness / luminosity and soft x - ray emission suggest that post - agb stars are important sources of ionizing photons in many objects @xcite . in fact , @xcite find that post - agb stars and white dwarfs could account for the placement of liners on the `` agn branch '' of optical line diagnostic diagrams , and this could also explain their extended line emission @xcite .",
    "if the emission lines in liners are indeed not directly indicative of the presence of a weak agn , this would considerably alter our view of agn demographics . by providing tracers of young stars ( e.g. pa@xmath7 , pa@xmath6 , and br@xmath8 ) and shocked gas ( e.g. [ fe ii ] , h@xmath4 )",
    ", nir spectra can be used to investigate the significance of these sources of ionization @xcite . in higher - luminosity active nuclei ,",
    "high - excitation nir coronal lines can be used to probe the agn ionizing continuum and the density of the surrounding medium , as well as outflows and gas - jet interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as well as stars and line - emitting gas , hot dust and the accretion disk also leave detectable ir signatures in a significant fraction of agn @xcite .",
    "the ir spectra of many seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars show an inversion around 1 @xmath0 m , interpreted as the minimum between the agn - heated dust whose emission peaks in the mid - infrared ( mir ) , and the accretion disk that emits strongly in the optical / uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low accretion rates ,",
    "however , this situation is expected to change .",
    "the inner region of the accretion disk is predicted to be replaced by an advection - dominated accretion flow @xcite , implying that the disk emission should shift redwards , perhaps into the nir @xcite .",
    "furthermore , various models suggest that the obscuring torus of the agn unified model should disappear when the accretion rate becomes sufficiently low @xcite .",
    "the dust continuum in such nuclei should therefore be weak .",
    "ir studies of the accretion disk and dust have so far been carried out on only a few low - luminosity agn , using high - resolution imaging in the nir and mir @xcite . using nir spectroscopy to reveal the disk and dust emission over a range of agn luminosities",
    "may unearth systematic trends that will allow a better understanding of accretion and obscuration in agn at low accretion rates .",
    "several sizeable compendia of nir spectra of local galaxies exist in the literature .",

    "* ) , a handful of groups have presented spectra covering the whole @xmath10.82.5 @xmath0 m range .",
    "@xcite compiled large - aperture spectra of 28 normal galaxies , creating template spectra of various morphological types and calculating k - corrections for these objects .",

    "most recently , a nir atlas of 23 star - forming galaxies was published by @xcite , and their stellar populations analyzed in @xcite .    in this paper , we present gemini nir spectroscopy of the nuclei of 50 galaxies , almost all from the palomar survey @xcite .",
    "the palomar galaxy survey provides a spectral atlas of a near - complete , flux - limited ( b@xmath912.5 mag ) sample of nearby , northern galaxies .",
    "the 486 palomar galaxies were observed in the optical with a 2  slit at a spectral resolution of r@xmath12000 , and the resulting spectra revealed 420 emission - line objects - seyferts , liners , transition objects ( to ; objects with [ oi ] strength intermediate between hii region galaxies and classical liners ) and hii nuclei - tracing nuclear activity at low luminosities .",
    "the uniform , statistically - significant data set has been an invaluable aid to research on a wide range of issues .",
    "the galaxies selected for this work were chosen from among the palomar galaxies showing emission lines in their optical spectra , with seyfert , liner , or , occasionally , to classification .",
    "the data complement published nir galaxy spectra in several ways .",
    "some of the more luminous , nearby agn in the subsample provide an opportunity to study numerous , strong agn emission lines . in most of the galaxies , however , the emission lines are weak and the continuum emission is dominated by starlight .",
    "this , together with the good signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectra , allows detailed study of undiluted atomic and molecular stellar absorption features .",
    "the wide , simultaneous wavelength coverage , in some cases with good enough telluric line removal to reveal the regions between the conventional @xmath10- , @xmath11- and @xmath12-band atmospheric windows , offers an extensive overview of the properties of nearby galaxy nuclei in the nir . and ,",
    "as the palomar galaxies are bright and nearby , it has been possible to obtain high - quality nir spectra with a relatively modest investment of telescope time .    in  [ sample ]",

    "[ obsdr ] gives details about the observations and data reduction , as well as information about accessing the spectra and the code used to produce them . in  [ results ]",
    "we show some illustrative spectra , compare the absorption - line and continuum spectra of intermediate - age and old galaxies , and discuss the emission lines observed in the data .",
    "additional material , including notes about individual objects , and the optical and nir spectrum of each one , is given in appendix [ a1 ] . in appendix",
    "[ a2 ] , we examine how the quality of the data between the nir atmospheric windows depends on the atmospheric water vapor column at the time of the observations .",
    "the intent of this paper is to present the spectra , point out some noteworthy features of the data , and act as a useful reference for the general nir properties of local galaxy nuclei .",
    "further analysis of various aspects of the data set will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "the galaxies selected for this work were drawn from the palomar nearby galaxy survey @xcite . with the exception of ngc  205 , an inactive galaxy chosen as an example of an intermediate - age stellar population (  [ abs ] ) , the targets are all classified by @xcite as seyferts , liners and tos . as well as these 48 galaxies , we also observed two non - palomar objects ( 1h1934 - 063 and ngc  7469 ) in common with @xcite , to compare the results with previously published spectra .",
    "the characteristics of the palomar emission - line galaxies in this sample , and those of the remainder of the seyferts , liners and tos in the original palomar study , are shown in figure [ histo ] .",
    "the objects studied here were chosen primarily to extend the range of agn with nir spectra to lower luminosities than currently available .",
    "the hard x - ray luminosities of the agn are therefore generally low relative to well - known seyferts such as ngc  1068 and ngc  4151 ( log ( l@xmath2 [ erg s@xmath3 ) = 42.8 and 42.5 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "they do , however , lie towards the high end of the x - ray luminosity distribution of the palomar seyferts / liners / tos as a whole .",
    "this is because ( i ) in future work we are interested in decomposing the spectra into stellar and agn ( accretion disk and dust ) components , and recovering agn emission from seeing - limited spectra of very low - luminosity agn may not be possible ; and ( ii ) brighter nuclei were prioritized in order to enable observations in sub - optimal conditions (  [ obsdr ] ) .",
    "the brighter nuclei also tend to be well - studied objects with plentiful ancillary data , potentially allowing fuller exploitation of the data .",
    "the sample contains comparable numbers of seyfert and liner nuclei of both types 1 and 2 , and their host galaxies span a range of morphological types from e to sm .",
    "the distances to the galaxies range from 0.7 - 92 mpc , with a median of 20 mpc .",

    "these are all spiral galaxies with dust lanes crossing the line of sight ( see notes in appendix [ a1 ] ) , suggesting that this spectral shape is due to extinction .",

    "the locations of molecular bands ( other than co ) that are prominent in spectra of late - m giants , s stars , and c - n stars , as shown by @xcite , are indicated by horizontal lines in figure [ abslines_fig ] .",
    "these bands are generally weak , broad , and often overlapping in wavelength , and stars other than tp - agb stars may contribute to them .",
    "for instance , the noticeable absorption around 0.94  @xmath0 m in our spectra may be a blend of zro ( m giants , s stars ) , cn ( c - n stars , supergiants ) , and tio ( late - m giants and dwarfs ) .",
    "similarly , the broad , shallow dip between @xmath1 1.32  1.5 @xmath0 m is likely caused by both h@xmath4o and cn .",
    "the relatively isolated vo feature at @xmath171.05 @xmath0 m is particularly strong in late - type m giants @xcite .",
    "a full determination of the dependence of these molecular features on the stellar populations of these galaxies requires accurate stellar population synthesis modelling , and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , as a preliminary exploration , in figures [ igals ] and [ ogals ] we compare the ir and optical spectra of galaxies identified as `` intermediate - age '' and `` old '' .",
    "the intermediate - age category consists of three objects that are well - known for their strong balmer absorption lines , indicating star formation occurring within the last 1.5 gyr .",
    "these galaxies are ngc  205 , ngc  404 , and ngc  4569 @xcite .",
    "roughly 70% of the optical light of ngc  205 is emitted by stars with ages @xmath10.1  1 gyr @xcite , and this galaxy is used by @xcite as the intermediate - age template object in their optical stellar population synthesis work on low - luminosity agn .",
    "they find that ngc  404 and ngc  4569 are the galaxies in their sample with the most significant intermediate - age populations , with upwards of 70% of the 4020  emission accounted for by the ngc  205 template .",
    "the old galaxies are those with ages @xmath185 gyr , based on published analysis of their optical spectra . the central optical spectra and/or line indices of these objects are best described by stellar populations with ages of @xmath15  11 gyr ( see references in appendix [ a1 ] ) . many of the galaxies in this sample fit this criterion , so for clarity of presentation we restrict that category in figure [ ogals ] to those with the cleanest telluric line removal ( defined as s / n@xmath1920 at 1.32 - 1.37 @xmath0 m )",
    "these are ngc  2768 , ngc  2832 , ngc  3147 , ngc  4548 , ngc  4594 , and ngc  5850 .",
    "a qualitative comparison of figures [ igals ] and [ ogals ] suggests some systematic differences between the nir spectra of intermediate - age and old galaxies .",
    "first , the nir continuum shape of the old galaxies differs from that of the younger galaxies , becoming noticeably flatter at short wavelengths .",
    "this is not due to extinction ; dust is not detected in hst optical images of ngc  2832 , for example @xcite , and a variable nuclear uv source is detected in ngc  4594 ( despite the galaxy being highly inclined ; * ? ? ?",
    "neither is agn activity likely to be responsible for altering the shape of the spectra .",
    "ngc  205 and ngc  2832 have very different ages and continuum shapes , yet neither shows evidence for agn activity ( beyond the presence of a few , very weak emission lines in ngc  2832 ; appendix a ) .",
    "the different spectral shape of the intermediate - age galaxies therefore appears to be due to their younger , bluer stellar populations relative to those of the old galaxies .",
    "the 1.6  @xmath0 m `` bump '' , which is strong in the atmospheres of k- and m - type giants and supergiants @xcite , is also more pronounced in the old galaxies .",
    "additionally , the broad , molecular absorption features are generally stronger in the old objects .",
    "this is noteworthy given that the stellar populations of the intermediate - age galaxies should contain large numbers of the tp - agb stars discussed above and in  [ intro ] .",
    "depending on their age , metallicity , and pulsation cycles , these stars have deep features from molecules such as cn , c@xmath4 , h@xmath4o , and vo @xcite .",
    "this is reflected by the evolutionary population synthesis models of @xcite , which predict strong molecular features in stellar populations with ages @xmath11 gyr . however , the 1.1 @xmath0 m cn band in the galaxies in figure [ igals ] is weak compared to that in the old galaxies , as are the 1.05 @xmath0 m vo band and the feature at @xmath10.93 @xmath0 m ( likely a blend of cn , tio , and zro ) . gauging the strength of the @xmath11.4 @xmath0",
    "m h@xmath4o band is difficult because of the likely blending with cn absorption , the adjoining h@xmath16 bump , and telluric residuals in ngc  205 and ngc  404 , but any minimum around this wavelength appears no stronger in the intermediate - age galaxies than in the old ones .    this simple comparison ,",
    "although based on just a few objects , suggests that models that predict a relatively featureless nir spectrum will provide a better description of galaxies with significant intermediate - age populations .",
    "one caveat is that the intermediate - age galaxies all have relatively low stellar velocity dispersions ( 20 @xmath20 ) , while with the exception of ngc  4548 ( @xmath21 = 113 km s@xmath22 ) , the old galaxies are high - dispersion systems with 140 @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the well - known relations between @xmath21 and metallicity @xcite and the abundances of carbon , nitrogen , and @xmath7-elements @xcite then suggest that the intermediate - age galaxies are metal - poor , while the old galaxies are metal - rich .",
    "the spectral differences between these sets of galaxies may therefore reflect differences in metallicity as well as in age .",
    "this conclusion also relies on the optical spectra being a reasonably reliable indicator of the age of the stellar population that dominates in the nir .",
    "differences in stellar populations derived from optical and nir spectra have been observed in star - forming and seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "these differences have been attributed to the inclusion of regions of star formation in the wider optical slit ; the detection of dust - enshrouded stellar populations in the nir ; and the differing sensitivity of the optical and nir regimes to stars of different ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has also been found that post - starburst spectra indicative of intermediate - age stars can arise in spatially isolated regions of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "we are therefore working to obtain aperture - matched optical data for in - depth population synthesis of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "nonetheless , these observations provide an initial illustration of the nir characteristics of intermediate - age and old stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "emission lines are also present in many of the spectra , being particularly numerous and prominent in some of the seyferts . in figure",

    ", the optical spectrum is a good predictor of the ir emission - line spectrum : objects with plentiful , strong lines in their optical spectrum have a rich ir line spectrum , and vice versa .",

    "mid - ir spectra covering the nucleus and inner ring show emission in several h@xmath4 and fine structure lines , and the detection of [ o iv ] 25.9 @xmath0 m emission at the nucleus implies the presence of either an agn , wolf - rayet stars , or shocks @xcite .",
    "pah emission is also detected at the nucleus , as well as in the ring .",

    "the gnirs spectrum ( fig . [ f48 ] ) is similarly free from detectable emission lines .",
    "qualitatively it is rather similar to those of the liners and transition objects in this sample , but many of the absorption lines are shallower and the broad h - band `` bump '' (  [ cont ] ) appears somewhat weaker than in many other objects .",

    "the gnirs spectrum ( fig . [ f50 ] ) shows all these lines in addition to [ sivii ] at 2.48@xmath0 m , which was not previously reported .",
    "the main difference between the present and previous nir spectroscopy is that the continuum in the gnirs spectrum is flatter .",
    "this is probably because the 0.3  slit used for these observations is significantly smaller than that of previous observations ( 0.8 ) and therefore includes less emission from the host galaxy . otherwise , the spectroscopy presented here matches very well previous observations covering a similar wavelength interval .",
    "+        * ngc 7469 ( s1 ) * + this seyfert1 galaxy has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "its most prominent characteristic is a circumnuclear ring ( 1.5@xmath63 ) of powerful starburst activity observed at radio , optical , near - infrared , and mid - infrared wavelengths ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , with a luminosity that amounts to two - thirds of the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy .",
    "nir spectroscopy of this source has been published by several authors including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gnirs emission line spectrum ( fig . [ f49 ] ) agrees well with that presented by @xcite .",
    "the main difference is found in the continuum , with the gnirs spectrum displaying an excess of continuum over the underlying power - law at the red end of the spectrum , peaking at @xmath64 m .",
    "this feature can be interpreted as emission from dust heated to its sublimation temperature ( @xmath1 1800  k ) by the agn .",
    "although this excess was also detected by @xcite , it is more conspicuous in the gnirs spectrum , probably due to the smaller slit width which isolates the nir emission from the host galaxy and circumnuclear ring of star formation .",
    "@xmath0 m and [ siii ]  0.907 , 0.953@xmath0",
    "m are the most conspicuous lines observed , and high - ionization lines of [ sviii ] , [ six ] , [ sivi ] , [ sivii ] and [ six ] are also identified .",
    "stellar absorption features are detected mostly in the @xmath11- and @xmath12-bands , and the 2.3 @xmath0 m co bandheads are prominent .",
    "the cat at 0.85  @xmath0 m is also present but is affected by the superimposed , broad oi  0.845@xmath0 m emission line .",
    "the regions between the traditional nir bands suffer from poor atmospheric transmission and strong absorption from telluric molecules ( fig .",
    "[ trans ] ) .",
    "access to these regions can be desirable , however , for studies of features such as h@xmath4o and c@xmath4 bands in evolved stellar populations , or emission lines in redshifted galaxies .",
    "the main atmospheric absorber in these inter - band regions is h@xmath4o , while co@xmath4 also contributes around 1.4 , 1.6 , and ( especially ) 2.0 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "telluric water vapor is monitored at several observatory sites , giving observers the opportunity to adapt their observing strategy to the prevailing conditions . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "though , the empirical relationship between atmospheric water vapor and the s / n in the inter - band regions of the final spectrum , after dividing by a standard star to remove the telluric lines , has not yet been presented in an easily - accessible form . in the gnirs data set we have many pairs of galaxies and standard stars observed under a wide range of observing conditions .",
    "we therefore use the galaxy spectra to explore the effect of telluric water vapor on data quality in the regions of the spectrum around 1.35 and 1.85 @xmath0 m .",
    "first , figures [ tau1 ] - [ tau4 ] present the reduced spectra arranged in order of increasing 225 ghz zenith optical depth ( @xmath65 ) , or atmospheric water vapor column ( wv ) , at the start of the observation data are available , and ngc  315 and ngc  4395 , whose poor sky subtraction makes them unsuitable for this analysis . ] .",
    "the 225 ghz optical depth is measured every 10 minutes by a tipping radiometer at the caltech submillimeter observatory @xcite , and is related to the water vapor column above mauna kea as wv = 20(@xmath65 - 0.016 ) mm @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric water vapor column varies with elevation and azimuth angle @xcite , so @xmath65 is not necessarily an accurate indication of the water vapor column affecting the gnirs observations .",
    "nonetheless , the trend to lower s / n in the inter - band regions with increasing @xmath65 is clear .",
    "ngc  2768 , for instance , observed at @xmath66 ( wv@xmath10.7 mm ; figure [ tau1 ] ) , displays a very clean spectrum , whereas the inter - band regions of ngc  1358 ( @xmath67 ; wv@xmath15 mm ; figure [ tau4 ] ) are unusably noisy . roughly speaking ,",
    "the inter - band regions tend to be fairly free of residuals from dividing by the standard star up to @xmath68 ( wv@xmath11.1 mm ) .",
    "regardless of the water vapor , however , almost all spectra display at least a small residual just shortwards of the pa@xmath7 wavelength of 1.875 @xmath0 m , where the atmosphere is virtually opaque even in the best conditions .    in fig .",
    "[ snvtau ] we show the s / n achieved in the galaxy spectra in two areas of strong h@xmath4o absorption .",
    "on the whole , the s / n in these inter - band regions increases markedly as the wv decreases . at 1.35  1.39 @xmath0 m ( between the j and h bands ) , s / n@xmath130 - 70 is often achieved below wv@xmath11.3 mm .",
    "improvement is also seen at 1.81  1.85 @xmath0 m ( between h and k ) , with s / n@xmath120 quite frequently being reached in dry conditions .",
    "there is considerable scatter in the plots , though , particularly at 1.81  1.85 @xmath0 m .",
    "the point at 1.2 mm , s / n=5.4 in the right - hand plot is ngc  3169 .",
    "the airmass match between this galaxy and its standard star was unusually poor , which may account for its unusually low s / n given the water vapor .",
    "there is no obvious reason for the other points in the lower left corner of the plot , which may instead be related to random spatial and temporal variations in the atmosphere .",
    "while the trend in s / n vs @xmath69 is clear , the absolute values of the s / n obtained in very dry conditions are less straightforward to interpret .",
    "they may either indicate the limit on the achievable s / n imposed by systematic errors from the division by the standard star , or they may reflect the s / n that could be achieved for each object in the exposure time used for the observations , or other effects . for comparison , we also show the s / n in neighboring , relatively `` clean '' spectral regions .",
    "as expected , the s /",
    "n in those regions is not related to the water vapor column . in this particular data set ,",
    "the s / n achieved at 1.35  1.39 @xmath0 m in dry conditions is comparable to that obtained in a relatively absorption - free region of the h band at 1.51  1.55 @xmath0 m . at 1.81  1.85 @xmath0 m , the s / n is systematically lower than that reached at 1.73  1.77 @xmath0 m , regardless of the conditions .",
    "the fact that we obtain similar s / n at 1.35  1.39 and 1.51  1.55 @xmath0 m is likely an artifact of our simple definition of the s / n as the mean / rms of the points in that region .",
    "all else being equal , the s / n at @xmath11.35 @xmath0 m will be lower than that at @xmath11.55 @xmath0 m , simply because the strong atmospheric absorption means that the telescope receives fewer photons from the astronomical object at those wavelengths .",
    "the fact that the s / n is similar in regions of high and low transmission implies that systematic effects are limiting the measured s / n in the regions of high transmission . in this case , this likely results from the fact that the galaxy spectra contain real spectral structure that contributes to the measurements of the rms in the spectrum .",
    "when similar s / n is reached in regions of low transmission , we are probably also measuring similar spectral structure .",
    "observations of pairs of featureless standard stars , which were not obtained as part of this observing program , would enable a more in - depth exploration of the limiting s / n that can be achieved in dry conditions . nonetheless , we can draw some general conclusions .",
    "on one hand , it is possible to achieve s / n of several tens even in regions of very poor atmospheric transmission when the atmospheric water vapor column @xmath701 mm . on the other hand , observing when the local @xmath69 meter indicates low water vapor is not a foolproof means of attaining high s / n : the relation between s / n and @xmath69 in figure [ snvtau ] contains considerable scatter .",
    "also , it is important to realize that the atmospheric transmission is zero under many of the narrow lines that are blended together in fig .",
    "[ trans ] ( see e.g. the high - resolution mauna kea transmission spectrum shown by * ? ? ?",
    "this means that if a narrow spectral feature lies at one of these wavelengths , it will not be detected in the final spectrum even if the telluric line cancellation is very good .",
    "a number of groups have been investigating correcting for telluric absorption using atmospheric models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "until these methods are in widespread use , we hope that the analysis presented here will aid the planning of observations at the edges of the nir atmospheric windows .",
