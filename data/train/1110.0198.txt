    "although hydrodynamic models have seldom been used in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , they are widely used in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , where a very strong interacting matter called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed .",
    "it has been found that this matter has a very small viscosity and behaves like a nearly perfect fluid .",
    "below the temperature @xmath3 mev hadronization happens and the viscosity of the system increases .",
    "although there have already been extensive studies on the shear viscosity of the qgp  @xcite and that of the relativistic hadron gas  @xcite , only a few studies have been devoted to the viscosity of nuclear matter formed in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "even fewer studies have been devoted to the isospin dependence of the viscosity  @xcite .",
    "it is thus of great interesting to study the viscosity of the neutron - rich nuclear matter , especially its isospin dependence , formed in the intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions as in the ibuu transport model .",
    "many methods in the literature have been used to study the viscosity  @xcite , among which directly using green - kubo formulas is the first - principle way of the study  @xcite . in the present study",

    "this approach is helpful in studying how the pauli blocking , in - medium cross sections and in - medium effective masses will affect the shear viscosity and can give qualitative ideas how the shear viscosity changes with density , temperature and isospin asymmetry of the nuclear matter .",

    "the parameter @xmath34 is used to mimic the density dependence of the symmetry energy while keeping the properties of symmetric nuclear matter unchanged .",
    "comparison between the results from the ibuu transport model calculation with the experimental results of isospin diffusion data leads to @xmath35 at subsaturation densities  @xcite and with that of @xmath2 ratio somehow leads to a super soft symmetry energy @xmath36 at suprasaturation densities  @xcite . in the following @xmath37",

    "a smaller relaxation time means the nucleon on average experiences more frequent collisions .",
    "a constant cross section would make the relaxation time decrease with increasing momentum , as higher - momentum nucleons are more likely to collide with others . using the energy - dependent free - space nucleon - nucleon cross sections , there are peaks around @xmath110 mev , corresponding to the minimum values of the free cross sections as shown in fig .  [ freecs ] . due to the smaller effective masses of nucleons in the nuclear medium , which leads to smaller in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross sections , the relaxation times are larger .",

    "it is seen that there are always more chances for collisions between nucleons with different isospins than those with same isospin , mainly because of the larger degeneracy factor for @xmath119 than @xmath120 as in eqs .",

    "[ taurhot ] the effects of density and temperature on the relaxation time are displayed .",
    "it is seen that compared with the case at @xmath40 mev , the relaxation time is generally larger at @xmath38 mev , due to the fact that the nucleons are less energetic at lower temperatures .",
    "furthermore , there appears a peak around @xmath124 mev indicating a stronger pauli blocking effect near the fermi surface .",
    "this can be understood as nucleons near the fermi surface are more likely to collide with those below the fermi surface due to larger cross sections at lower center - of - mass energy , but these collisions are largely blocked at @xmath38 mev . at @xmath41 the peaks move to a higher momentum and are even stronger , as the fermi momentum is higher and the pauli blocking effect is stronger due to the less diffusive distribution function as shown in fig .",
    "again the relaxation times are larger from smaller in - medium cross sections , and at higher densities and lower temperatures this effect is larger due to smaller nucleon effective masses .        the specific viscosity , i.e , the ratio of the shear viscosity over the entropy density , is shown in upper panels of fig .",

    "although the effective mass decreases with increasing density , which leads to a larger flux between flow layers as in eq .",
    "( [ shearf ] ) , and a larger relative velocity between nucleons in eqs .",
    "( [ tausame ] ) and ( [ taudiff ] ) , the pauli blocking effect is stronger at higher densities .",
    "the combined effects lead to an increasing trend of the specific viscosity with increasing density at lower temperatures , but a slightly decreasing trend with increasing density at higher temperatures when the pauli blocking effect is much weaker .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to seen that the specific viscosity is larger in neutron - rich nuclear matter than in symmetric nuclear matter at all the densities and temperatures , especially at lower temperatures .",
    "this is because that the neutron relaxation time is larger than proton in neutron - rich nuclear matter and it contributes more to the total shear viscosity according to eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) due to a less diffusive neutron momentum distribution function . at lower temperatures ,",

    "the specific viscosity is much larger at lower temperatures and higher densities , when the in - medium cross sections are smaller from smaller in - medium effective masses . the isospin effect on the specific viscosity is somehow smaller , compared with the results from free - space nucleon - nucleon cross sections , due to the isospin - dependent modification on the in - medium cross sections . as the effective mass of neutrons is larger than that of protons in neutron - rich nuclear matter , the isospin effect on @xmath126 is smaller from in - medium cross sections than that from free - space cross sections , as shown in panel ( e ) of fig .  [ tauisospin ] . at @xmath40 mev ,",
    "the specific viscosity is only about @xmath127 @xmath128 , which is already close to the value of qgp extracted from the transverse momentum spectrum and elliptic flow using the viscous hydrodynamic model  @xcite .",
    "the specific viscosity obtained in this way is similar to that extracted from the buu model calculation using the green - kubo formulas  @xcite , which is around @xmath129 at lower energies and reduces to as low as @xmath130 at higher energies .",

    "the large isospin effect is also observed in results from the brueckner theory  @xcite . the parabolic approximation is good even for very large isospin asymmetry , and it seems to be better at lower densities or higher temperatures .",
    "in this paper i discussed the specific viscosity from the relaxation time approach by using the mdi interaction and the nucleon - nucleon cross sections from the experimental data modified by the in - medium effective masses as used in the ibuu transport model calculations . in neutron - rich nuclear matter , the relaxation time of neutrons increases while that of protons decreases , compared with that in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the specific viscosity decreases with increasing temperature because of more frequent collisions and weaker pauli blocking effect . at lower temperatures , the specific viscosity increases with increasing density due to increasing effect of pauli blocking while at higher temperatures it slightly decreases with increasing density due the smaller in - medium effective masses . the specific viscosity increases with increasing isospin asymmetry , mainly from the larger relaxation time of neutrons in neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "both the shear viscosity and specific viscosity roughly follow the parabolic approximation with respect to the isospin asymmetry .    as in this frame work",
    ", the effect of the interaction on the specific viscosity only comes from the effective mass , i.e. , the momentum dependence of the single - particle potential , the value of @xmath34 , which determines the density dependence of the symmetry energy , will not affect the results .",
    "in reality , the transitive matrix @xmath140 will also be modified in the medium , especially at higher densities . in a more realistic brueckner - hartree - fock calculation",
    "@xcite , the in - medium cross section is calculated by consistently taking account of the two - body and three - body nucleon forces . it was found that the in - medium cross section is more isotropic compared with the cross section in free space as the forward and backward peaks are largely reduced , and including the three - body force would further reduce the nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "an isotropic cross section generally leads to a smaller viscosity than an anisotropic one with forward and backward peaks as the effective transport cross section is larger in the former case , while including the contribution from the three - body force seems to increase the viscosity .",
    "in addition , the system is assumed to consist of uniform nuclear matter in the present study . at higher densities and/or temperatures ,",
    "inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions such as @xmath141 become important , and @xmath142 resonances and pions will be abundantly produced . at lower densities and/or temperatures , liquid - gas phase transition will occur and clusters will be formed .",
