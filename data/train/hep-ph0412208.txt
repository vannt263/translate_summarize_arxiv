    "the series of workshops on `` what comes beyond the standard model ? '' started in 1998 with the idea of organizing a real workshop , in which participants would spend most of the time in discussions , confronting different approaches and ideas .",
    "the picturesque town of bled by the lake of the same name , surrounded by beautiful mountains and offering pleasant walks , was chosen to stimulate the discussions .",
    "the idea was successful and has developed into an annual workshop .",
    "very open - minded and fruitful discussions have become the trade - mark of our workshop , producing several published works .",
    "it takes place in the house of plemelj , which belongs to the society of mathematicians , physicists and astronomers of slovenia .",
    "* why has nature made a choice of four ( noticeable ) dimensions ?",
    "while all the others , if existing , are hidden ? and what are the properties of space - time in the hidden dimensions ?",
    "* how could nature make the decision about the breaking of symmetries down to the noticeable ones , if coming from some higher dimension @xmath6 ? *",
    "why is the metric of space - time minkowskian and how is the choice of metric connected with the evolution of our universe(s ) ? * where does the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter originate from ? *",
    "why do massless fields exist at all ? where does the weak scale come from ?",
    "* why do only left - handed fermions carry the weak charge ?",
    "why does the weak charge break parity ? * what is the origin of higgs fields ? where does the higgs mass come from ? * where does the small hierarchy come from ? ( or why are some yukawa couplings so small and where do they come from ? ) * do majorana - like particles exist ? * where do the generations come from ? * can all known elementary particles be understood as different states of only one particle , with a unique internal space of spins and charges ?",
    "* how can all gauge fields ( including gravity ) be unified and quantized ?",
    "* why do we have more matter than antimatter in our universe ? *",
    "what is our universe made out of ( besides the baryonic matter ) ? * what is the role of symmetries in nature ?",
    "* what is the origin of the field which caused inflation ?",
    "* how are the randomness and the fundamental laws of nature connected ?",
    "we have discussed these and other questions for ten days .",
    "some results of this efforts appear in these proceedings .",
    "some of the ideas are treated in a very preliminary way .",
    "some ideas still wait to be discussed ( maybe in the next workshop ) and understood better before appearing in the next proceedings of the bled workshops",
    ". the discussion will certainly continue next year , again at bled , again in the house of josip plemelj .",
    "there is ( not yet ) any experimental evidence , which would be in disagreement with the standard electroweak model ( one should , of course , understand the neutrino nonzero masses just as a natural extension of the standard model ) .",
    "but the standard electroweak model has more than 20 parameters and assumptions , the origin of which is not at all understood .",
    "there are also no theoretical approaches yet which would be able to explain all these assumptions and parameters .",
    "we expect a lot from experiments on new extremely sophisticated and expensive accelerators and spectrometers , but measurements will first of all corroborate or not predictions for several events calculated with models and theories .",
    "the standard electroweak model assumes the left handed weak charged doublets which are either colour triplets ( quarks ) or colour singlets ( leptons ) and the right handed weak chargeless singlets which are again either colour triplets or colour singlets .",
    "it also assumes three families of quarks and leptons and the corresponding  anti quarks  and  anti leptons  , without giving any explanation about the origin of families and  anti families  .",
    "it assumes that the quarks and the leptons are massless - until gaining a ( small ) mass at low energies through the vacuum expectation value(s ) of higgs fields and yukawa couplings , without giving any explanation , why is this so and where does the weak scale come from .",
    "the great advantage of the approach of ( one of ) us , which unifies spins and charges@xcite , is , that it proposes possible answers to open questions of the standard electroweak model .",
    "we demonstrate that a left handed @xmath0 weyl spinor multiplet includes , if the representation is interpreted in terms of the subgroups @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the sum of the two @xmath10 s , spinors and  anti spinors  of the standard model - that is the left handed @xmath8 doublets and the right handed @xmath8 singlets of with the group @xmath9 charged quarks and chargeless leptons , while the  anti spinors  are oppositely charged and have opposite handedness . right handed neutrinos and left handed anti neutrinos - both weak chargeless - are also included .",
    "we demonstrate that , when starting with a spinor of one handedness only , although spinor representations of subgroups contain represetations of both handedness with respect to each of the subgroups , yet each of the two representations might be distinguished by the charges - the gauge kaluza - klein charges - of subgroups and accordingly , the choice of the representation of a particular handedness is still possible , and accordingly spinors couple chirally to the corresponding gauge fields .",
    "our gauge group is @xmath0 - the smallest complex lorentz group with a left handed weyl spinor containing the needed representations of the standard model .",
    "the gauge fields of this group are spin connections and vielbeins@xcite , determining the gravitational field in ( d = 14)-dimensional space .",
    "then a gauge gravitational field manifests in four dimensional subspace as all the gauge fields of the known charges , and ( as alleady written ) also as the yukawa couplings .",
    "it was demonstrated@xcite that the approach offers a possible explanation for families of spinors and their masses , since a part of the gravitational gauge fields originating in higher than four dimensions appears as terms manifesting the yukawa couplings , postulated by the standard electroweak model .",
    "the approach suggests ( approximate ) symmetries of mass matrices , requires that four - rather than three - families appear at low energies and suggests splitting of the four families into two by two families .",
    "it also suggests that the proposed symmetries must be slightly broken , so that the mixing matrices (  ckm  matrix in the case of three families ) would not be just unity .    in this work",
    "we start with the action , suggested by the approach , as well as with by the approach suggested approximate symmetries of the matrix elements of the yukawa couplings .",
    "we study , how the way of breaking the suggested symmetries influences the mass matrices ( expectation values of yukawa couplings in the approach ) and the mixing matrices . trying to keep suggesting symmetries as far as possible and minimizing the number of free parameters of the model , we discuss the properties of the mixing matrices and by fitting the free parameters with the experimental data ( using the monte - carlo procedure )",
    ", we were able to make some preliminary predictions for matrix elements of the mixing matrice for four families of quarks , as well as for the mass of the fourth @xmath1 quark .",
    "in this section we present some of properties of one weyl spinor of the group @xmath0 in terms of the properties of subgroups @xmath11 and of @xmath12 .",
    "we formulate spinor representations as products of binomials , which are either nilpotents or projectors - clifford algebra odd and even binomials of @xmath13 s , respectively . for details",
    "we kindly ask the reader to see refs.@xcite .",
    "we define two kinds of the clifford algebra objects , with the properties @xmath14 the operators @xmath15 are introduced formally as operating from the left hand side ( as @xmath13 s do ) on all the clifford algebra objects , but they are indeed define as operating from the right hand side as follows @xmath16 with @xmath17 for a clifford even and odd object , respectively .      the generators of the subgroups @xmath21 and the two @xmath10 , needed to determine the spin , the weak charge , the colour charge and the two hypercharges will be written in terms of @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 representing the corresponding subgroup and @xmath25 the corresponding structure constants .",

    "it can easily be checked that the only solution is @xmath374 neither 3 nor 6 satisfies .",
    "this gives that the dimension is 4 .",
    "fortunately @xmath370 equals 2 ( the dirac bispinor ) as it must since it is the inversion  which can only interchange one block with another  that requires blocks .",
    "there can thus be only two .",
    "the dimension then must be 3 or 6 , but can only be 4 .",
    "that seems to imply that any universe is impossible .",
    "fortunately the choices are 3 and 4 , thus can be both .",
    "uniquely 3 + 3 = 6 ; the three generators of so(3 ) plus the three of so(3 ) gives the same number of generators as the six of so(4 ) .",
    "that group is not simple but only semisimple .",
    "it is easy to prove that this is the only orthogonal group that is not simple  only for dimension 4 can this argument work . and",
    "that is just the dimension the argument gives .",
    "each of the so(3 ) groups has the correct number of transformations to satisfy the condition from real angles , the two together satisfy the condition for complex ones .",
    "one group acts on each of the two - dimensional spinors , the other group acts on the pair treating it as a two - dimensional spinor ( each of which has two components ) .",
    "the six generators of so(4 ) break into two sets , each of the three generators of so(3 ) . only for dimension 4 is this splitting possible .    why does this work ?",
    "the ( complex ) statefunction must split into two corresponding parts ( since space also allows an inversion ) , here each themselves of two parts giving four ( components ) altogether .",
    "rotations act ( identically ) on each of the two pieces but boosts ( changes of speed ) do not , differing in minus signs .",
    "however as there are two parts an additional set of transformations mixes them .",
    "hence the group of transformations of real space , co(4 ) , has twelve parameters .",
    "but there are an additional three parameters because the inversion gives a pair of spinors and this group mixes them .",
    "coordinate systems obtained by these transformations on space are possible  it must be possible to write physical laws using any .",
    "equations have to be form - invariant under them .",
    "thus space allows a 15-parameter set of transformations , the same number as that of su(4 ) .",
    "the electron statefunction illustrates this .",
    "rotations mix up and down states .",
    "but we have pairs of these .",
    "so another set of rotations mixes the pairs ( each a pair ) .",
    "two sets of rotations are thus needed giving two sets of transformations on complex statefunctions .",
    "each of the two sets of ( three ) rotations has a set of ( homomorphic ) transformations on complex variables  each acts in a three - dimensional space which is one of the two possible spaces allowed by the first condition .",
    "thus the set ( of the two sets together ) , with six parameters ( three complex parameters so six real numbers ) plus the set of unitary transformations mixing the blocks ( spinors ) have a ( homomorphic ) set of unitary transformations going with it .    in summary",
    "what transformations are there for this 4-dimensional complex statefunction ? clearly those of su(4 ) .",
    "however if we rotate ( with complex parameters ) we induce transformations on each of the two - dimensional spinors .",
    "there are two 3-dimensional real spaces whose transformations act independently on these spinors ( because so(4 ) , being uniquely semisimple , splits into two parts ) .",
    "this gives 12 transformations .",
    "also the pair of spinors is a 2-dimensional complex number , giving three more transformations .",
    "the total number is thus 15 , equal to that of su(4 ) .",
    "space must have dimension 4 .",
    "yet that is not unique .",
    "is it 4 of space , 3 of space and 1 of time , or 2 of each ?",
    "the signature is irrelevant to these arguments ; only the number of parameters mat- ters .",
    "both so(4 ) and so(2,2 ) are only semisimple  ( @xcite , p.  868 ;  @xcite , p.  274 ) , which is necessary for this argument  ( @xcite , p.  52 ;  @xcite , p.  340 ) .",
    "each consists of two parts these acting on 3-dimensional spaces .",
    "but 3-dimensional spaces do not satisfy as we see .",
    "however so(3,1 ) fortunately is simple .",
    "physics , a universe , is only possible in a space of dimension 3 + 1 , three of space plus one of time .",
    "these conditions are necessary  only dimension 3 + 1 is possible  but that does not mean that the groups are homomorphic , only that they can not be in any other dimension .",
    "it is well - known that they are  ( @xcite , p.  65 ) ,  ( @xcite , p.  6 ) , so this need not be discussed here .",
    "the universe is possible , but just barely .",
    "the equations must have integer solutions .",
    "there is no reason to expect that any have integer solutions , that there is any integer that satisfies any one  and certainly not all .",
    "change only one number in any of the equations even by 1 .",
    "then its solution would not be an integer . that mere change would make universes hopeless .",
    "and there must be two blocks , which is just what the inversion gives .",
    "but the inversion has nothing to do with the counting arguments that give the requirement of two blocks .",
    "as we see there are several  independent  arguments ; none should be satisfied and definitely not all , all together . yet",
    "strangely there is one dimension and one only  it is unique  that does satisfy all  and all at once .",

    "such diagrams violate conservation of energy ( thus the entire set must ) . while there are various ways of considering this , protons can not decay because of conservation of energy as we see formally below .",

    "can this take a baryon to a state whose fermions are only those not having strong interactions ?    what is a proton ?",
    "mathematically ( the only way it can be treated ) it is a function obeying dirac s equation with mass @xmath378 and the ( here irrelevant and suppressed electromagnetic , gravitational ) , weak and strong interactions ( whose forms are irrelevant ) .",
    "it is the presence of interactions that determines what a proton is .",
    "( correctly an object is an eigenstate of the two poincar invariants  ( @xcite , sec .",
    "6.3 , p.  114 ) . for a free particle , and one with an electromagnetic interaction ,",
    "dirac s equation is equivalent . whether this is true with other interactions seems unknown so consequences of , perhaps important , differences if any are not clear . and putting interactions in invariants , which must be done whether dirac s equation is used or not , might limit them .",
    "particles are also eigenstates or sums of the momentum operators  ( @xcite , sec .  5.4 , p.  93 ) ,",
    "of which the hamiltonian is one .",
    "we ignore these , and refer to dirac s equation but discussions should be of invariants which might be revealing .",
    "the statefunction ( a better term than wavefunction ) of the proton is a solution of coupled nonlinear equations .",
    "we need information about it but can not solve so represent it in a way that allows analysis using an expansion .",
    "the arguments though are exact ; we do not calculate so need not truncate .    the physical particle , labeled with a capital , that obeying dirac s equation with all interactions , is a sum of states ( schematically ) : @xmath379 summing over all states to which the proton is connected by interactions including any number of pions and so on .",
    "the summations represent ones over internal labels and integrals over momenta .",
    "all are suppressed ; this argument is very general .",
    "state @xmath380 is the function satisfying dirac s equation with the weak interaction , but not the strong .",
    "the effect of that is given by this sum which is thus an eigenstate with mass @xmath378 , of the total hamiltonian , including all interactions .",
    "individual terms in the sum differ in energy and momenta ; it is the sum that has the eigenvalues .",
    "thus what this does is to write the strongly - interacting object as a sum of terms of objects ( states satisfying equations ) that have no strong interactions .",
    "hence we are putting in the strong interaction explicitly by writing the physical object as this sum .",
    "we then can distinguish between objects with and without the particular interaction we wish to consider .",
    "coefficients are determined by the requirement that this be a solution of that set of complete equations for all objects to which the proton is coupled , directly or indirectly , and normalization @xmath381 .",
    "also the initial state , a wavepacket , taken as a proton at rest , gives the coefficients at @xmath377 = 0 .    the effect of the hamiltonian is seen from that of @xmath351 which is a sum of the free particle hamiltonians for the proton , pion ( and so on ) and leptons , plus terms for weak and strong interactions .",
    "the state of the system is a sum of terms , one the state of the proton , another ( if decay were possible ) the product of pion and lepton states and such , each summed over other labels and with integrals over momenta or space .",
    "the free part of @xmath351 changes the phase .",
    "the weak interaction part , were decay possible , decreases the coefficient of the proton in the sum , while increasing that of the ( say ) pion plus lepton , initially zero  starting as a proton , the state becomes a sum of the proton , its contribution decreasing , plus the pion plus lepton state , with increasing contribution ( and so on for other states ) .",
    "for the decaying pion the behavior is similar : starting as a pure pion it becomes a sum of that plus a state of leptons with the contribution of the first decreasing , of the second increasing .",
    "what goes wrong ?",
    "the weak interaction acts on @xmath380 supposedly causing it to decay , so the final state is @xmath382 showing the transition to a pion plus a lepton , and to three leptons , and so on , with coefficients of non - occurring terms zero .",
    "the energy of @xmath383 is @xmath378 , not @xmath384 , so needs contributions from all terms .",
    "but @xmath383 is say a lepton plus a pion so other terms , to which this is orthogonal , can not contribute .",
    "hence we can see why the proton can not decay .",
    "state @xmath380 satisfies the equation with the weak interaction , thus is caused to decay by it .",
    "but its mass is not the physical mass since the equation it satisfies is not the equation satisfied by the physical object .",
    "however the physical object decays ( were that possible ) because of the decay of each of these terms .",
    "each term however gives a state with energy less than the mass of the mass of the physical object .",
    "it is only the sum of masses that equals the physical one . but these ( smaller ) masses can not be summed because the final states are different .",
    "the physical proton can decay to only one ( for each decay ) and the mass of that one is less than the mass of the initial state .",
    "the decay of the proton can not conserve energy , thus can not occur .",
    "an intuitive way ( which must be used very carefully as it can be misleading ) of looking at this is that the proton has a contribution to its mass because of its strong interaction and this disappears when it decays .",
    "the argument for electric - charge conservation is the same .",
    "charge conservation is related to gauge invariance , a partial statement of poincar invariance  ( @xcite , sec .",
    "3.4 , p.  43 )  this relates an allowed interaction to the poincar group . an interaction violating charge conservation would not transform under gauge transformations as other terms in the hamiltonian , giving poincar transformations ( on massive objects ) that induce gauge transformations ( on massless ones ) resulting in physically identical observers who undergo the different gauge transformations  these can not be fully specified  thus physically identical , but who see different hamiltonians .",
    "the hamiltonian would not be well - defined , implying inconsistent physics .",
    "it is fortunate that charge is conserved .",
    "there are other implications requiring investigation ; we mention a few in hope of stimulating such .",
    "all interactions known are of lowest order .",
    "for electromagnetism linearity is enforced by gauge ( poincar ) transformations  ( @xcite , sec .",
    "4.2 , p.  57 ) . for strong interactions ,",
    "take a particle , a @xmath386 or @xmath387 , that emits a pion .",
    "higher order terms would couple it not to a single pion , but to more .",
    "intuitively we can guess why only lowest order occurs since it gives diagrams which we interpret ( purely heuristically ) as two or more pions emitted sequentially .",
    "higher - order means that these are emitted together .",
    "however this is the limit of the lowest order in which the time between emissions goes to zero .",
    "a higher order interaction would be this limit which is included in the lowest order as one case ; higher - order terms adding nothing would be irrelevant . summing all diagrams , and integrating over time , would give contributions from terms that have the same effect as higher - order ones , thus changing only the value of the sum , so the value of the coupling constant  an experimental parameter ( at present ) .",
    "thus we could not distinguish contributions from terms of different order implying higher order would be undetectable .",
    "this regards particles as virtual . but consider a decay in two steps , each emitting a pion . if the intermediate object s life were sufficiently short this would be equivalent to pions being emitted simultaneously .",
    "if a nucleon had an interaction of the form @xmath388 , the emission of an @xmath389 pair could be thought of as due to the decay of a pion , and the interaction taken as the limit of the emission of a pion and then its decay , when its lifetime becomes zero , merely changing the sum .",
    "these are purely heuristic and must be investigated in greater depth .",
    "this is part of a long investigation of how geometry through its transformation groups limits and determines physics  @xcite .",
    "geometry is quite powerful , and quite limiting . and",
    "physics is quite limited  strangely enough to laws that allow life  @xcite .",
