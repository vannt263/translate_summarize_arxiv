    "relative delays between the synchrotron ( our _ swift _ uvot data ) and the inverse compton ( our _ swift _ xrt and _ fermi _ lat data ) counterparts , are dominated by energy stratification and geometry of the emitting region . in ssc - dominated zones the synchrotron emission is co - located with the inverse - compton production site , and such 4-day optical - uv to @xmath16-ray lag",

    "another contribution to such deviations might also be the averaging over long periods of time , hence combining variability effects , resulting in a cumulation of photons from different activity `` flavors '' ( different source brightness and spectral hardness ) being included in the evaluation of the spectrum . in the case of pks 1502 + 106",
