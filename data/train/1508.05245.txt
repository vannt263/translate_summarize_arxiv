    "degenerate optical parametric oscillators ( dopos ) consist of a driven optical cavity containing a crystal with second - order optical nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "down - conversion in the crystal can generate a field at half the frequency of the driving laser and classical electrodynamics predicts that such field will start oscillating inside the cavity only if the external laser power exceeds some threshold value , where the nonlinear gain can compensate for the cavity losses .",
    "a fully quantum - mechanical theory , on the other hand , reveals that even below threshold the down - converted field is not vacuum , but a squeezed field whose quantum correlations increase as the threshold is approached .",
    "recent developments in the fabrication of crystalline whispering gallery mode ( cwgm ) resonators @xcite have opened the way to study the intracavity interplay between down - conversion and optomechanics @xcite , a setup that we will refer to as _ degenerate optomechanical parametric oscillator _ ( dompo ) .",
    "so far , it has been shown that the presence of down - conversion in an optomechanical cavity can help enhancing mechanical cooling @xcite , normal mode splitting @xcite , sensitivity in position measurements @xcite , or even bringing optomechanics close to the strong coupling regime with additional bath engineering @xcite . in all these works , however , the nonlinear crystal is operated as a parametric amplifier , providing a nonlinear gain to some external field that is injected in the cavity at the down - converted frequency ( _ stimulated _ down - conversion ) .",
    "in contrast , the description of the interaction between the field generated via _ spontaneous _",
    "down - conversion and the mechanical mode is much more challenging , since ( below threshold ) the former is purely quantum mechanical @xcite , so that the optomechanical coupling can not be linearized and does not admit a simple gaussian description .    in this work",
    "we provide a theory for the dompo which can be trusted all the way to threshold , and is obtained by combining traditional adiabatic elimination techniques with our recently developed self - consistent mori projector ( c - mop ) theory @xcite . to this end",
    "we first introduce the master equation which models the dompo , and perform an adiabatic elimination of the optical modes by neglecting the mechanical backaction .",
    "the mechanical state is found to stay approximately thermal for parameters compatible with current cwgm resonators , with an effective temperature dependent on the steady - state value and two - time correlation function of the down - converted photon number , which we derive in two ways .",
    "first by treating the pump mode as a classical field ( semi - classical approach ) , allowing us to obtain simple analytical expressions and provide a physical explanation for the regions of significant cooling , showing that the system provides a realistic implementation of the cooling - by - heating mechanism @xcite below threshold .",
    "second , by using c - mop theory on the optical dynamics to find reliable results at threshold and justify the absence of the mechanical backaction onto the optics .",
    "remarkably , this accurate approach allows us to prove that the semi - classical predictions break down when working very close to threshold , where cooling is shown to disappear .",
    "these results might have strong implications not only for future analysis , but also for previous results which make use of semi - classical approaches while working very close to threshold @xcite .",
    "in the final section we apply c - mop theory on the full optomechanical problem , and identify the region of the parameter space where the mechanical backaction on the optics is negligible ( which contains the parameters of our interest ) .",

    "one is in the vicinity of the threshold point and can be traced back to the vast increase of the photon number @xmath61 which makes @xmath62 for virtually any value of the remaining parameters .",
    "however , as we will show below with the c - mop approach , so close to threshold this semi - classical approach breaks down , hence rendering this prediction incorrect .",
    "the other region , which turns out to be of major significance when aiming for optimal cooling , corresponds to @xmath63 , see the black solid line in fig .",
    "[ nf classical ] .",

    "[ nf classical ] to the region above the black dashed line ) .",
    "this transformation diagonalizes the hamiltonian in the optical liouvillian ( [ ls ] ) , so that , defining the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the transformed state @xmath69 evolves according to @xmath70+(\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}+1 ) \\mathcal{d}_{a_s}[\\tilde{\\rho}]+\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}\\mathcal{d}_{a_s^\\dagger}[\\tilde{\\rho } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & -[\\mathrm{i}\\omega a_m^\\dagger a_m,\\tilde{\\rho}]+(\\omega / q)\\{(\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{th}+1)\\mathcal{d}_{a_m}[\\tilde{\\rho}]+\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{th}\\mathcal{d}_{a_m^\\dagger}[\\tilde{\\rho}]\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + [ \\omega\\eta_\\mathrm{om}m(a_s^2 a_m^\\dagger - a_s^{\\dagger 2 } a_m),\\tilde{\\rho}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] within the rotating - wave approximation , valid under the conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , see appendix [ cooling by heating app ] .",

    "the optomechanical coupling is dressed by the squeezing parameter @xmath75 , similarly to the dressing by the intracavity field amplitude in standard sideband cooling @xcite . however , at difference with that case the interaction exchanges phonons with pairs of photons ( rather than single photons ) , thus explaining why @xmath76 is the resonance condition for cooling . within this condition , assuming @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we furthermore find @xmath79 .",
    "the cooling efficiency @xmath43 thus receives an additional contribution @xmath80 from the effective thermal photon number , which is a direct consequence of the nonlinear nature of the effective optomechanical coupling in ( [ newpictureme ] ) that can not be found in standard sideband cooling , as we discuss in appendix [ cooling by heating app ] .",

    "the simplest way of obtaining the optical correlator @xmath111 is by using standard linearization on @xmath171 . in this approach ,",

    "the semi - classical approach has allowed us to get analytical and physical insight into the problem .",
    "it is however well known that this approximation fails close to the critical point , although there is no systematic way of checking where exactly within the semi - classical formalism itself .",
    "hence , to determine where it exactly breaks down and to find more accurate results for those parameters , we make use of the recently developed c - mop technique @xcite , which allows finding reduced equations for the constituent parts of a composite system , even in situations where there is significant backaction among its parts and no time - scale separation between their dynamics .    for parameters compatible with cwgm resonators , the theory is already regularized by using c - mop only in the optical problem ( dopo ) , which provides a more accurate description for the optical correlation function ( [ two time corr ] ) and photon number that enter the effective mechanical dynamics . the application of c - mop to the dopo has been detailed in @xcite , but we review its most relevant steps for completeness in appendix [ c - mop theory ] . specifically , we use a combination of c - mop and a gaussian - state approximation , which provides an efficient and accurate tool capable of regularizing the divergencies and unphysical predictions of the semi - classical approach .",
    "in particular , we show in appendix [ c - mop theory ] that at threshold the decay rate of the optical correlator scales as @xmath92 , while the photon number as @xmath93 , in contrast to semi - classical results in which the former goes to zero while the latter diverges .",
    "we show a very representative case for the phonon number @xmath90 as a function of the distance to threshold @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ nf cmop vs classical ] .",
    "the method finds perfect agreement with the semi - classical predictions sufficiently below threshold , in particular verifying the cooling - by - heating effect presented above .",
    "most importantly , we find that the absolute minimum phonon number is indeed reached when the resonance condition @xmath94 is met . on the other hand , close to threshold",
    "we find a significant correction to the semi - classical predictions for the fundamental limit @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , while this is independent of the distance to threshold @xmath46 in the semi - classical picture , c - mop shows that it actually increases very rapidly as the critical point is approached , and hence no cooling is found no matter how much the efficiency @xmath43 is increased .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that when @xmath95 ( as happens at threshold ) , @xmath73 becomes imaginary and there is no resonance for the optomechanical interaction .",
    "the adiabatic elimination of the optical fields which we have used throughout the work relies on the time - scale separation between the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom . in particular ,",
    "such an approach neglects mechanical backaction onto the optics , which is a good approximation as long as the rate of any mechanical perturbation is much smaller than the intrinsic relaxation rate of the optics @xmath96 .",
    "far from the critical point the optical relaxation rate is @xmath6 , which usually dominates over any other rate in the system .",
    "however , as the critical point is approached the dopo dynamics exhibits a critical slowing down , and its relaxation rate becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "hence , in our work that considers parameters close to threshold , it is very important to check that the desired time - scale separation is present .",
    "an intuitive argument supporting such a time - scale separation follows from relating the mechanical backaction rate with the optical frequency - shift induced by the optomechanical interaction , @xmath97 , where we have used ( [ displacement ] ) .",
    "hence , using the scaling of @xmath61 and @xmath96 obtained in the previous section at threshold , the condition @xmath98 becomes @xmath99 , which is very well satisfied for the parameters that we work with .",
    "moreover , note that this condition is automatically satisfied when working within the monostability condition @xmath100 as long as @xmath101 .",
    "we can set more rigorous bounds to the region where mechanical backaction is negligible by using c - mop theory @xcite , since , in contrast to adiabatic elimination methods , it does not rely on the concept of time - scale separation or absence of backaction effects .",
    "hence , we apply this theory to the dompo system by using the time - dependent self - consistent mori projectors @xmath102 and @xmath103 , that is , using a bipartition `` optics @xmath104 mechanics '' for the system .",

    "in the main text we have shown that significant cooling can be obtained when working in the resolved sideband regime @xmath216 and close to the resonance condition @xmath217 .",

    "the photon - number operator is transformed into @xmath225 , and hence the optomechanical interaction can be approximated by @xmath226 within the rotating - wave approximation as long as @xmath227 .",

    "( [ app full master equation ] ) , with the only difference that the optical liouvillian is replaced by @xmath230 , corresponding to a single - mode at finite temperature , and the optomechanical interaction @xmath231 by @xmath232 .",
    "the adiabatic elimination of the optical mode can be carried out exactly in the same way as we did in appendix [ app1 ] , and under the cooling condition @xmath76 it would lead to the heating and cooling rates    @xmath233    where @xmath234 is the bare optomechanical cooperativity , and @xmath235 is a thermal state with mean photon number @xmath74 . the cooling efficiency is then given by @xmath236\\tilde{\\rho}_s\\}=2cm^2\\hspace{-1mm}\\left(\\hspace{-0.5mm}\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}\\hspace{-0.5mm}+\\hspace{-0.5mm}\\frac{1}{2}\\hspace{-0.5mm}\\right)\\hspace{-1mm}.\\ ] ] the `` cooling by heating '' effect is clearly seen because the cooling efficiency increases with the effective thermal photon number @xmath74 .",
    "but it is important to note that this enhancement of the cooling efficiency is a direct consequence of the commutator appearing in the trace , contributing as @xmath237=4a_s^\\dagger a_s+2 $ ] , which in turn comes from the fact that the effective optomechanical interaction @xmath238 corresponds to the exchange of phonons with pairs of photons . in the usual sideband laser cooling scenario ,",
    "the effective optomechanical interaction is bilinear , e.g. @xmath239 , meaning that the commutator in the expression above is replaced by @xmath240=1 $ ] , and hence the thermal photonic background does not enter the cooling efficiency .",
    "let us finally note that the fundamental limit can be written as @xmath241\\tilde{\\rho}_s\\}}=\\frac{\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}^2}{2\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}+1}\\;\\xrightarrow[]{\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}\\gg1 } \\ ; \\frac{\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}}{2},\\ ] ] which increases linearly with the effective thermal photon number .",
    "hence , as explained in the main text , the `` cooling by heating '' mechanism is optimized by finding a proper trade off between the increase in the cooling efficiency ( `` good noise '' ) and the increase in the fundamental limit ( `` bad noise '' ) .",
    "it is to be noted that within the usual sideband laser cooling , any thermal background will still contribute to this fundamental limit , @xmath242\\rho_s\\}\\xrightarrow[]{\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}\\gg1}\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{eff}$ ] , but , as explained above , it provides no enhancement of the cooling efficiency @xmath43 . in other words , in standard sideband cooling the thermal background acts only as `` bad '' noise .",
    "we emphasize that these expressions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 agree with the ones provided in the main text , which have been first calculated exactly within the semi - classical approach , and then approximated to leading order in @xmath243 for @xmath76 .",
    "despite the analytical and physical insight that it provides , the semi - classical approach suffers from several issues , most importantly its divergent character at threshold , which shows that it can not be trusted when working close to such point .",
    "unfortunately , there is no systematic way of checking within the formalism itself where exactly it fails .",
    "this question can only be answered by comparing it to a more accurate approach .",
    "to this aim , we have applied our recently developed self - consistent mori projector ( c - mop ) theory @xcite . in particular",
    "this approach has allowed us to characterize optical steady - state observables such as the photon number @xmath61 or the correlation function @xmath111 in all relevant parameter space , including threshold .",
    "we detailed the application of c - mop theory @xcite to the dopo problem in @xcite , including its combination with the gaussian - state approximation that we use in this work , which was shown to be quite accurate both for steady - state quantities and dynamics .",

    "in contrast , c - mop theory works with the reduced states of the pump and signal modes , @xmath245 and @xmath246 , respectively , whose coupled dynamics are approximated by the set of nonlinearly coupled equations    [ cmop eq app ] @xmath247\\nonumber   \\\\ & & + \\left ( \\frac{\\chi}{2}\\right)^2\\left\\{\\left[a_s^2\\,,\\,h_s(t)\\right]+\\text{h.c.}\\right\\ } , \\\\",

    "it is in those regions where a gaussian - state approximation becomes extremely useful .",
    "as the name suggests , such approximation consists in assuming that the reduced signal and pump states are gaussian , meaning that they are completely characterized by first and second order moments . under such circumstances",
    ", we can approximate third and fourth order moments of @xmath182 as in ( [ gsamoments ] ) , and the c - mop equations provide a closed set of nonlinear equations for the first and second order moments of the operators @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",

    "<S> degenerate optomechanical parametric oscillators are optical resonators in which a mechanical degree of freedom is coupled to a cavity mode that is nonlinearly amplified via parametric down - conversion of an external pumping laser . below a critical pumping power the down - converted field is purely quantum - mechanical , making the theoretical description of such systems very challenging . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a theoretical approach that is capable of describing this regime , even at the critical point itself . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the down - converted field can induce significant mechanical cooling and identify the process responsible of this as a cooling - by - heating mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that , contrary to naive expectations and semi - classical predictions , cooling is not optimal at the critical point , where the photon number is largest . </S>",
    "<S> our approach opens the possibility for analyzing further hybrid dissipative quantum systems in the vicinity of critical points . </S>"
