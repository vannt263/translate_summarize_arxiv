    "[ ptb ]    caduna5.epsc:/users/desktop/documents/google drive / articoli / articoli - in - preparazione / cardonedurantenazarov1/graphics / caduna5__4.pdf    it is very important in the above - mentioned approach to detect embedded eigenvalues that the asymptotic procedures in use are completed in such a way they provide both , a formal derivation of asymptotic expansions and an operator reformulation of the diffraction problem in the framework of the perturbation theory of linear operators , see , e.g. , @xcite , which helps to conclude a smooth ( actually analytic ) dependence of scattering matrices on geometrical parameters describing the waveguide shape .",

    "the above - mentioned criterion for the existence of embedded eigenvalues is formulated in terms of the matrix @xmath97 , see theorem [ theorema ] and note that its proof is completed by theorem [ theoremma ] about solutions of the problem ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) with a fast exponential decay . in section [ sect3 ] we construct formal asymptotic expansions of the augmented scattering matrix which are justified in  section [ sect6.4 ] . in order to detect an embedded eigenvalue in section [ sect4 ] we need the main asymptotic and first correction terms .",
    "the two - fold nature of the box - shaped perturbation manifests itself in different anstze for the diagonal entries @xmath99 and @xmath100 of the matrix @xmath97 . in the first case the asymptotic procedure looks like as for a regular perturbation of the boundary , that is the boundary layer phenomenon does not influence the main asymptotic term @xmath99 in the expansion@xmath101 in the second case the correction term @xmath102 in the expansion @xmath103 results from the boundary layer phenomenon while the regular expansion affects higher - order terms only .",
    "it should be emphasized that the augmented scattering matrix is unitary and symmetric and the main asymptotic term in the expansion@xmath104 of the anti - diagonal entries can be computed by means of both the approaches .    in section [ sect4 ]",
    "we first reduce the criterion @xmath105 from theorem [ theorema ] to an abstract equation and second solve it with the help of the contraction principle .",
    "finally we formulate theorems [ theoremex ] and [ theoremun ] on the existence and uniqueness of the embedded eigenvalue .",

    "we evaluate remainders in the asymptotic formulas ( [ s11])-([s01 ] ) for the augmented scattering matrix theorem [ theoremasy ] while the boundary layer phenomenon brings additional powers of @xmath108 into bounds of estimates .",
    "other necessary properties of the matrix are clarified in section [ sect7 ] where the uniqueness of the embedded eigenvalue is verified , too .",

    "the reflection coefficient @xmath142 ought to be regarded as a scattering matrix of size @xmath154 in view of the only one couple of waves ( [ 13 ] ) which are able to drive energy along the waveguide ( [ 11 ] ) .",
