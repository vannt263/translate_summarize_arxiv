    "in the last thirty years a continuing effort has been devoted to the investigation of superheavy nuclei both in experiments and in theoretical research .",
    "a fascinating challenge in the study of these nuclei is the quest for the islands of stability where the next magic numbers beyond @xmath1 and @xmath0 may be located .",
    "experiments made at gsi , dubna and berkeley have allowed the synthesis and detection of some superheavy nuclei .",
    "for instance , light isotopes of the elements @xmath7 , 111 and 112 have been obtained at gsi and dubna @xcite .",
    "they have been identified by their characteristic @xmath8-decay chains which lead to already known isotopes .",
    "these new nuclei are expected to be deformed , consistently with the predicted occurrence of a deformed magic shell closure at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "first data of some heavier and more neutron - rich isotopes of atomic number @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath13175 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) produced by means of fusion reactions have also been measured at dubna @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions made at the end of the sixties pointed towards the existence of an island of long - lived superheavy elements ( she ) centered around @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the nuclei around the hypothetical doubly magic element @xmath16114 were expected to be nearly spherical with longer half - lives .",
    "such superheavy nuclei , having a negligible liquid - drop fission barrier , would be stabilised mostly by quantal shell effects .",
    "many of the more recent theoretical works on superheavy nuclei are based on the nuclear mean field approach and can be classified in two main groups .",
    "on the one hand , we have the macroscopic - microscopic models which include a liquid - drop contribution for the part of the energy which varies smoothly with the number @xmath17 of nucleons , and a shell correction contribution obtained from a suitable single - particle potential for the fine tuning . on the other hand , there are the self - consistent hartree - fock or hartree calculations based on skyrme forces or on the relativistic non - linear @xmath18 model , respectively .",
    "the nuclei in the range around @xmath19 already detected in experiments bridge the gap between the known actinides and the unknown superheavy elements . with the advent of more experimental data",
    ", a commendable endeavor has been undertaken in nuclear structure research @xcite aimed at verifying the reliability of the present theoretical models in the regime of the heavier actinides and of the discovered superheavy nuclei around @xmath7 , which requires deformed calculations .",
    "the fact that many of the observed data for she are for odd - even decay chains renders the calculations and the comparison with experiment even more complicated , since the deformed level density is high and the observed nuclei may be in isomeric states .",
    "calculations with self - consistent models of some @xmath8-decay chains @xcite , deformation energy curves along the fission path @xcite , and shell structures @xcite find that there is a gradual transition from well - deformed nuclei around the deformed @xmath9 and @xmath10 shell closures to spherical shapes approaching larger superheavy nuclei around the putative @xmath5 magic neutron gap , in qualitative agreement with the earlier studies in mac - mic and semiclassical models . still , the hartree - fock model mass formula of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts large deformations in many of the isotopes of @xmath6 and in almost all of the @xmath3 isotopes .",
    "as pointed out in some recent works , the description of deformed she may require to consider triaxial deformations and reflection - asymmetric shapes @xcite ( ref .  @xcite pioneered the relativistic mean field triaxial calculations ) .",
    "it is even possible that there exist isolated islands of stability associated with exotic ( semi - bubble , bubble , toroidal , and band - like ) topologies in nuclei with very large atomic numbers @xcite .",
    "another longstanding goal of the nuclear structure studies in the field of superheavy nuclei has been to establish the location in @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the next _ spherical double _ shell closures for elements heavier than @xmath22pb , and of the largest shell effects which are a necessary condition for the stability of she against fission . in this context ,",
    "most of the calculations published in the literature are performed in spherical symmetry .",
    "it is well established that the macroscopic - microscopic calculations predict spherical shell closures at @xmath6 and @xmath5 @xcite . in self - consistent calculations , however , the proton and neutron shell structures strongly affect each other and other @xmath20 and @xmath21 values can appear as candidates for shell closures depending on the model interaction .",
    "for example , hartree - fock calculations with a variety of skyrme forces show the most pronounced spherical shell effects at @xmath23 and @xmath5 @xcite . as an exception to this rule , skyrme parametrizations such as ski3 and ski4 which have a modified spin - orbit interaction prefer @xmath3 and @xmath6 , respectively , for the proton shell closure @xcite .",
    "hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations with the finite range gogny force predict @xmath24 and @xmath25 as possible spherical ( or nearly spherical ) shell closures @xcite . at variance with skyrme hartre ",
    "fock , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory with the conventional scalar and vector meson field couplings typically prefers @xmath3 and @xmath2 as the best candidates for spherical shell closures @xcite .",
    "of course , the different nature of the spin - orbit interaction in the skyrme and rmf models is pivotal in deciding the location of the stronger shell effects .",
    "detailed comparisons between skyrme hartree - fock and rmf calculations of she can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies in the predicted spherical shell closures for she motivate us to reinvestigate them using the more general rmf model derived from the chiral effective lagrangian proposed by furnstahl , serot and tang @xcite . in this first attempt to apply the effective field theory ( eft ) model to the region of superheavy nuclei",
    "we will restrict ourselves to analyze the occurrence of double shell closures and the shell stabilizing effect in spherical symmetry , as done e.g.  in refs .",
    "we want to learn whether in this respect the eft approach shows a different nature compared to the usual rmf theory or not .",
    "the possible extension of the calculations to deformed geometries and the subsequent application of the eft model to the heavier actinides and the lighter transactinides where experimental data have been measured is left for future consideration .    the relativistic model of refs .",
    "@xcite is a new approach to the nuclear many - body problem which combines the modern concepts of effective field theory and density functional theory ( dft ) for hadrons .",
    "an eft assumes that there exist natural scales to a given problem and that the only degrees of freedom relevant for its description are those which can unravel the dynamics at the scale concerned .",
    "the unresolved dynamics corresponding to heavier degrees of freedom is encoded in the coupling constants of the theory , which are determined by fitting them to known experimental data .",
    "the lagrangian of furnstahl , serot and tang is intended as an eft of low - energy qcd . as such",
    ", its main ingredients are the lowest - lying hadronic degrees of freedom and it has to incorporate all the infinite ( in general non - renormalizable ) couplings consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd . to endow the model with predictive power the lagrangian",
    "is expanded and truncated .",
    "terms that contribute at the same level are grouped together with the guidance of naive dimensional analysis .",
    "truncation at a certain order of accuracy is consistent only if the coupling constants eventually exhibit naturalness ( i.e. , if they are of order unity when in appropriate dimensionless form ) . in the nuclear structure problem",
    "the basic expansion parameters are the ratios of the scalar and vector meson fields and of the fermi momentum to the nucleon mass @xmath26 , as these ratios are small in normal situations .",
    "to solve the equations of motion that stem from the constructed effective lagrangian one applies the relativistic mean field approximation in which the meson fields are replaced by their classical expectation values .",
    "eft and dft are bridged by interpreting the expansion of the effective lagrangian as equivalent to an expansion of the energy functional of the many - nucleon system in terms of nucleon densities and auxiliary meson fields .",
    "the rmf theory is then viewed as a covariant formulation of dft in the sense of kohn and sham @xcite .",
    "that is , the mean field model approximates the exact , unknown energy functional of the ground - state densities of the nucleonic system , which includes all higher - order correlations , using powers of auxiliary classical meson fields .",
    "this merger of eft and dft provides an approach to the nuclear problem which retains the simplicity of solving variational hartree equations with the bonus that further contributions , at the mean field level or beyond , can be incorporated in a systematic and controlled manner .",
    "if the chiral effective lagrangian is truncated at fourth order , in mean field approach one recovers the same couplings of the usual non - linear @xmath18 model plus additional non - linear scalar - vector and vector - vector meson interactions , besides tensor couplings @xcite .",
    "the free parameters of the resulting energy functional have been fitted to ground - state observables of a few doubly - magic nuclei .",
    "the fits , parameter sets named g1 and g2 @xcite , do display naturalness and are not dominated by the last terms retained ; an evidence which confirms the usefulness of the eft concepts and validates the truncation of the effective lagrangian at the first lower orders .",
    "the ideas of eft have been fruitful @xcite , moreover , to elucidate the empirical success of previous rmf models , like the original @xmath18 model of walecka @xcite and its non - linear extensions with cubic and quartic scalar self - interactions @xcite . however , these conventional rmf models truncate the effective lagrangian at some level without further physical rationale or symmetry arguments .",
    "the introduction of new interaction terms in the effective model pursues an improved representation of the relativistic energy functional @xcite .",
    "previous works have shown that the eft model is able to describe in a unified manner the properties of nuclear matter , both at normal and at high densities @xcite , as well as the properties of finite nuclei near and far from the valley of @xmath27 stability @xcite , with similar and even better quality to standard rmf force parameters . with this positive experience at hand , in the present paper",
    "we want to investigate the predictability of the new effective lagrangian approach to the nuclear many - body problem in extrapolations to superheavy nuclei .",
    "concretely , we shall focus on analyzing the model predictions for spherical shell closures .",
    "our calculations will be performed in spherical symmetry .",
    "though deformation is an important degree of freedom for she @xcite , we are searching for spherical shell stability around @xmath28114 and @xmath29120 where deformation is expected to be small and where the shell structure has often been analyzed in the spherical approximation @xcite . for exploration",
    ", we also compute hyperheavy nuclei around @xmath30 which spherical calculations have found to correspond to a possible region of increased shell stability @xcite .",
    "deformation would certainly change the picture in the details and add deformed shell closures , e.g. , like those predicted around @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , but it should not change drastically the predictions for the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 where the strongest shell effects show up already in the spherical calculation . of course , for a quantitative discussion , one needs to account for deformation effects which will serve to extend the island of shell stabilized superheavy nuclei and to decide on the specific form of the ground - state shapes of these nuclei .",
    "our analysis uses the eft parameter sets g1 and g2 @xcite . the results are compared with those obtained with the nl3 parameter set @xcite , taken as one of the best representatives of the usual rmf model with only scalar self - interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we briefly summarize the rmf model derived from eft and our modified bcs approach to pairing .",
    "the third section is devoted to the study of several properties of superheavy nuclei such as two - particle separation energies and shell gaps , average pairing gaps , single - particle energy spectra , and shell corrections .",
    "the summary and conclusions are laid in the fourth section .",
    "the eft model used here has been developed in ref .",
    "further insight into the model and the concepts underlying it can be gained from refs .",

    "variation of the energy density ( [ edf ] ) with respect to @xmath37 and the meson fields gives the dirac equation fulfilled by the nucleons and the klein - gordon equations obeyed by the mesons ( see refs . @xcite for the detailed expressions ) .",
    "we solve the dirac equation in coordinate space by transforming it into a schrdinger - like equation .",
    "in this work we shall employ the eft parameter sets g1 and g2 of ref.@xcite that were fitted by a least - squares optimization procedure to 29 observables ( binding energies , charge form factors and spin  orbit splittings near the fermi surface ) of the nuclei @xmath38o , @xmath39ca , @xmath40ca , @xmath41sr and @xmath22pb .",
    "a satisfactory feature of the set g2 is that it presents a positive value of @xmath42 , as opposed to g1 and to most of the successful rmf parametrizations such as nl3 .",
    "we note that the value of the effective mass at saturation @xmath43 in the eft sets ( @xmath44 ) is somewhat larger than the usual value in the rmf parameter sets ( @xmath45 ) , which is due to the presence of the tensor coupling @xmath46 of the @xmath47 meson to the nucleon @xcite .",
    "also , the bulk incompressibility of g1 and g2 is @xmath48 mev , while the nl3 set has @xmath49 mev .      in order to describe open - shell nuclei the pairing correlations have to be explicitly taken into account .",
    "the most popular approach for well - bound isotopes has been the bcs method",
    ". however , the bcs approximation breaks down for exotic nuclei near the drip lines because it does not treat the coupling to the continuum properly .",
    "this difficulty is disposed of either by the non - relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory , with skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite forces , or by the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) theory @xcite .",
    "pairing correlations are another important ingredient in the study of superheavy elements .",
    "furthermore , some of the predicted regions of shell stability in superheavy nuclei lie close to the drip point and a suitable treatment is required . many calculations of she have often used a zero - range two - body pairing force @xmath50 , with adjustable strengths for protons and neutrons ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a study of she using the rhb approach , with the nl - sh parameter set , was carried out in ref.@xcite .    to deal with the pairing correlations we use here a simplified prescription which we have previously found to be in acceptable agreement with rhb calculations @xcite .",
    "the procedure is similar to the one employed for skyrme forces in ref .",
    "@xcite . for each kind of nucleon",
    "we assume a constant pairing matrix element @xmath51 , which simulates the zero range of the pairing force , and we include quasibound levels in the bcs calculation as done in ref .",
    "these levels of positive single - particle energy , retained by their centrifugal barrier ( neutrons ) or by their centrifugal - plus - coulomb barrier ( protons ) , mock up the influence of the continuum in the pairing calculation .",
    "the wave functions of the considered quasibound levels are mainly localized in the classically allowed region and decrease exponentially outside it . as a consequence , the unphysical nucleon gas which surrounds the nucleus if continuum levels are included in the normal bcs approach is eliminated @xcite .",
    "we restrict the space of states involved in the pairing correlation to one harmonic oscillator shell above and below of the fermi level , to avoid the unrealistic pairing of highly excited states and to confine the region of influence of the pairing potential to the vicinity of the fermi level .    as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the solution of the pairing equations allows us to find the average pairing gap @xmath52 for each kind of nucleon .",
    "we write the pairing matrix elements as @xmath53 .",
    "we have fixed the constants @xmath54 by looking for the best agreement of our calculation with the known experimental binding energies of ni and sn isotopes for neutrons , and of @xmath55 and @xmath56 isotones for protons @xcite .",
    "the values obtained from these fits are @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 mev for the g1 set , @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 mev for the g2 set , and @xmath61 mev and @xmath62 mev for the nl3 interaction .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we applied this improved bcs approach with the g1 and g2 parametrizations to study one- and two - neutron ( proton ) separation energies for several chains of isotopes ( isotones ) from stability to the drip lines .",
    "we found a reasonable agreement with the available experimental data , similar to the one obtained using the nl3 set .",
    "the analysis showed that the parameters sets based on eft are able to describe nuclei far from the @xmath27-stability valley when a pairing residual interaction is included .",
    "traditionally a large gap in the single - particle spectrum has been interpreted as an indicator of a shell closure , at least for nuclei of atomic number @xmath63 . however , for a large nucleus like a superheavy element , it may not be sufficient to simply draw the single - particle level scheme and to look for the gaps , due to the complicated structure of the spectrum and the presence of levels with a high degree of degeneracy .",
    "moreover , in a self - consistent calculation , a strong coupling between the neutron and proton shell structure takes place .",
    "therefore , when dealing with she it is imperative to look for other quantities to reliably identify the shell closures and magic numbers , apart from the analysis of the single - particle level structure .",
    "here we shall consider the following observables as indicators for shell closures : + a ) a sudden jump in the two - neutron ( two - proton ) separation energies of even - even nuclei , defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of neutrons ( protons ) in the nucleus for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "a sharp drop in @xmath68 means that a very small amount of energy is required to remove two more nucleons from the remnant of the parent nucleus .",
    "thus , the parent nucleus is more stable which is a character of magicity .",
    "this observable is an efficient tool to quantify the shell effect because of the absence of odd - even effects @xcite .",
    "+ b ) the size of the gap in the neutron ( proton ) spectrum is determined by half of the difference in fermi energy when going from a closed shell nucleus to a nucleus with two additional neutrons ( protons ) .",
    "this quantity is very well accounted for by the two - neutron ( two - proton ) shell gap which is defined as the second difference of the binding energy @xcite : @xmath69 this quantity measures the size of the step found in the two - nucleon separation energy and , therefore , it is strongly peaked at magic shell closures .",
    "+ c ) the neutron and proton average pairing gaps @xmath52 of open - shell nuclei can be related to the odd - even mass difference , from where the empirical law @xmath70 can be derived @xcite . however , for closed shell nuclei @xmath52 should vanish .",
    "thus , we shall use the vanishing of the average pairing gap obtained from our calculations as another signal for identifying closed shell nuclei .",
    "we next calculate the above observables for the isotopic chain of @xmath3 and for several isotonic chains , assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "we employ the parameter sets g1 and g2 due to the eft formalism and compare the results with those obtained from the standard rmf parametrization nl3 , which is well established as a successful interaction for nuclei at and away from the line of @xmath27 stability .",
    "it is to be mentioned that the previous indicators correspond to energy differences between neighbouring nuclei .",
    "however , they do not have a direct connection with the shell corrections which stabilize a given ( @xmath71 ) superheavy nucleus against fission @xcite .",
    "the shell corrections are related to the difference between the nuclear binding energies and the predictions of a liquid - drop model . as a complementary study , after our search for spherical shell closures",
    ", we shall analyze the shell corrections for the discussed chains of she .",
    "we first consider the chain of isotopes with atomic number @xmath3 , which is found as a magic number in recent relativistic mean field calculations of nuclei in the superheavy mass region @xcite .",
    "figure 1 collects the results obtained with the eft parameter set g2 .",
    "the two - neutron separation energies @xmath73 are displayed in the upper panel of this figure .",
    "the @xmath73 graph shows a smooth decrease with increasing neutron number @xmath20 throughout the whole chain except for the sudden jumps after the neutron numbers @xmath2 , 184 , and 258 .",
    "these jumps indicate the possible occurrence of a shell closure at these neutron numbers . using eq .",
    "( [ d2q ] ) we calculate the two - nucleon shell gap for neutrons for the same isotopic chain , and present the result in the middle panel of figure 1 .",
    "sharp peaks in @xmath74 are found at the same neutron numbers 172 , 184 , and 258 .",
    "it is seen that the peaks of @xmath2 and @xmath4 are more marked than the peak of @xmath5 .",
    "actually , the height of the peak at @xmath5 is around only one third of that of the peak at @xmath2 .",
    "one may note that the amplitude of the jumps in @xmath74 for shell closures is smaller in the she region than in the region of normal mass nuclei .",
    "this is expected due to the increase of the single - particle level density with increasing mass number .",
    "for example , for @xmath22pb and for the doubly - magic isotopes of tin and calcium we find values of @xmath74 between some 5 and 10 mev .",
    "the average pairing gap @xmath52 is representative of the strength of the pairing correlations .",
    "the curve for the neutron pairing gaps , displayed in the bottom panel of figure 1 , shows a structure of arches that vanish only at @xmath2 , 184 , and 258 . since the proton pairing gap @xmath75 is zero throughout the whole @xmath3 chain , we have not plotted it .",
    "although we use a simplified prescription for the calculation of the pairing gap @xcite , our value for @xmath52 can be considered as an average of the different state - dependent single - particle gaps which would be obtained if one had used a zero - range pairing force , as done e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , all of the three analyzed observables are pointing to the same neutron numbers as the best candidates for shell closures for @xmath3 with the g2 parametrization .",
    "the magic character of the proton number @xmath3 in combination with @xmath2 , 184 , and 258 is tested in the calculations for isotonic chains that we present in the next subsection . in analyzing the shell effects from a spherical calculation",
    "it is to be kept in mind that only for doubly - magic nuclei one can guarantee a spherical shape , when protons as well as neutrons experience a spherical shell closure . for open - shell nuclei",
    "the spherical solution does not always correspond to the ground state .",
    "inclusion of deformation might add extra stability for some @xmath3 nuclei other than @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and perhaps additional peaks would develop with respect to the neighboring background in the curve for @xmath74 , apart from the sudden jumps we have detected by means of the spherical calculation .",
    "only a deformed calculation could definitively decide in such cases the appropriate ground - state shape .",
    "nevertheless , the spherical solution gives a firsthand and overall view of the sequence of spherical shell closures , which we have obtained from indicators which imply differences of energies but not their absolute values .    in order to analyze the force dependence of the location of the shell closures for the superheavy nuclei",
    ", we calculate the quantities @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath79 with the eft set g1 and with the nl3 parameter set for the same isotopic chain @xmath3 and display the results in figures 2 and 3 , respectively . as in the case of the g2 set",
    ", the proton pairing gap @xmath75 vanishes for the whole chain of @xmath3 isotopes and it is not drawn .",
    "the global nature of the curves of figures 2 and 3 is quite similar to that observed previously with the g2 set .",
    "abrupt jumps in @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and the vanishing of the average neutron pairing gap @xmath79 , indicate shell closures at @xmath2 and 258 in both of the g1 and nl3 sets .",
    "the height of the peaks of @xmath74 at @xmath2 and 258 is very similar between the g1 and g2 sets , while they attain the largest values in the nl3 set . for the @xmath5 system , @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "show only a moderate jump in both g1 and nl3 , indicating a weaker shell closure than for @xmath2 and 258 .",
    "moreover , the neutron pairing gap @xmath79 does not vanish at @xmath5 with the g1 and nl3 sets , indicating that the occupancy of the single - particle levels is diffused across the fermi level , contrarily to the case of g2 .",
    "one expects a relatively large energy gap to appear between the last occupied and the first unoccupied single - particle levels for the neutron numbers corresponding to the shell closures detected above .",
    "let us now look into the neutron single - particle spectra , displayed in figure 4 , for the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 nuclei .",
    "all the three parameter sets g2 , g1 and nl3 show a large gap above the fermi energy for @xmath2 and 258 .",
    "but for the neutron number @xmath5 , there appear only moderate gaps across the fermi level for the g2 and g1 sets , and the gap is still smaller for nl3 .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous discussions of the other indicators .",
    "inspecting the @xmath4 level spectrum one can appreciate another visible energy gap across the neutron numbers @xmath80 ( 1k@xmath81 level ) and @xmath82 ( 1j@xmath83 level ) in all of the parameter sets . in spite of this ,",
    "no distinct indications for a shell closure were found for @xmath80 or @xmath84 in the curves of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath79 in figures 13 .",
    "if one compares the spectra for the three systems @xmath2 , 184 , and 258 , it can be noticed that the gap between two particular levels is strongly modified along the isotopic chain .",
    "consequently , an analysis of the spectra alone would not suffice and the use of the discussed energy indicators becomes mandatory in order to make predictions for shell closures in superheavy nuclei .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the isotonic chains of the neutron numbers which we have detected as candidates for spherical shell closures in the preceding study of the isotopic chain of @xmath3 .",
    "we start with the @xmath2 isotonic chain in figure 5 , which displays the two - proton separation energy @xmath85 , the two - proton shell gap @xmath86 , and the average pairing gaps @xmath75 and @xmath79 in the superheavy region from @xmath87 up to the proton drip line , for the eft model g2 and for the conventional rmf model nl3 . for brevity we do not present the results from the g1 set , since",
    "the previous section has shown that the predictions of g2 differ from nl3 more than in the case of g1 .    from figure 5",
    "one realizes that all the indicators signal a very robust shell closure at @xmath3 , and a much weaker shell closure at @xmath6 .",
    "the proton gap @xmath86 ( @xmath88 mev ) of the nucleus @xmath76 is nearly twice as large as the corresponding neutron gap @xmath74 ( @xmath89 mev , figures 1 and 3 ) . for",
    "the nl3 set , in addition , a little jump in @xmath85 and a small peaked structure in @xmath86 indicates the possibility of a weak shell closure taking place at @xmath90 .",
    "it is nevertheless known that the region around @xmath90 is deformed @xcite and thus the spherical solution does not correspond to the ground state .",
    "moreover , from the bottom panel of figure 5 , we see that the neutron pairing gap @xmath79 vanishes from @xmath7 till the proton drip point , but it is non - zero for smaller atomic numbers .",
    "the non - vanishing neutron pairing gap for the ( @xmath91 ) combination tells us that this can not be a doubly - closed shell nucleus .",
    "therefore , the neutron number @xmath2 exhibits a strong shell closure for the proton number @xmath3 but this magicity is washed out for @xmath92 . in conclusion , in the region of superheavy nuclei the magicity of a particular neutron number depends on the number of protons present in the nucleus .",
    "we next analyze the shell closures for @xmath5 and @xmath4 in combination with different proton numbers .",
    "in figure 6 we display the results for the @xmath5 isotonic chain .",
    "curves are somewhat similar to those for @xmath2 . in the g2 parametrization",
    "one identifies @xmath6 and @xmath3 as possible shell closures though the size of the jump in @xmath86 , which is similar for both proton numbers , is small if we compare it with the jump observed for ( @xmath93 ) in figure 5 . in the case of the nl3 parameter set",
    "there is some evidence for a weak shell closure at @xmath6 only , because the neutron pairing gap for @xmath3 does not vanish which prevents the combination ( @xmath94 ) from representing a doubly - magic nucleus .",
    "the results for @xmath4 neutrons are shown in figure 7 .",
    "we again find a strong signature for a shell closure at @xmath3 in both the g2 and nl3 parameter sets , whereas the indications for a shell closure at @xmath6 are much weaker .",
    "one also observes prominent jumps in @xmath85 and @xmath86 at @xmath95 ( nl3 ) and @xmath96 ( nl3 and g2 ) .",
    "but in this region , close to the proton drip line , the neutron pairing gap does not vanish .",
    "this implies that only the combination of @xmath4 with proton numbers @xmath6 and @xmath3 may exhibit a double shell closure character .",
    "figure 8 depicts the proton single - particle spectra obtained with the g2 and nl3 parametrizations for the illustrative examples of the @xmath97 , @xmath76 , @xmath98 , and @xmath77 nuclei .",
    "looking at the proton spectra for the systems with @xmath2 , a very large gap can be observed for 120 protons ( between the 2f@xmath99 and 3p@xmath100 levels for g2 , and between the 2f@xmath99 and 1i@xmath101 levels for nl3 ) .",
    "instead , practically no gap exists for 114 protons ( between the 2f@xmath102 and 2f@xmath99 levels ) , specially for the nl3 set .",
    "this is consistent with the very weak signals of magicity of @xmath6 in the case of the @xmath2 isotonic chain shown by the @xmath85 and @xmath86 indicators in figure 5 .    with the addition of only 12 neutrons , the proton spectra for",
    "the systems with @xmath5 exhibit a different pattern than for @xmath2 near the fermi energy ( cf .",
    "figure 8) .",
    "the gaps occurring between the levels corresponding to 114 protons and to 120 protons are now comparable in magnitude .",
    "this fact is in agreement with the relatively magic character of the @xmath98 and @xmath77 nuclei predicted by the indicators plotted in figure 6 . in any case , even for @xmath5 , the magicity of @xmath6 is always smaller than the one shown by @xmath3 , as one can see from the comparison of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "this discussion shows again the strong dependence of the proton ( neutron ) shell closures of she on the neutron ( proton ) numbers and thus the importance of using the energy indicators .      the stability of superheavy elements with an atomic number larger than @xmath103 is possible",
    "thanks to the shell effects . in the liquid droplet model picture",
    "these superheavy nuclei are unstable against spontaneous fission because the large coulomb repulsion can no longer be compensated by the nuclear surface tension .",
    "however , she may still exist because the quantal shell corrections generate local minima in the nuclear potential energy surface which provide additional stabilization .    in our context",
    "the shell correction energy is also useful as a different test for checking the robustness of the shell closures . for experimentally known shell closures , i.e.",
    ", up to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the shell corrections are strongly peaked around the magic numbers ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , providing enhanced binding for magic nuclei .",
    "however , in the superheavy mass region , instead of displaying sharp jumps , the shell corrections depict a landscape of rather broad areas of shell stabilized nuclei @xcite .",
    "still , in these areas the closed shell nuclei show a larger stabilization ( i.e. , more negative shell corrections ) than their neighbors . in the present subsection",
    "we want to study the shell corrections around our selected nuclei with @xmath6 and @xmath3 , and @xmath2 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the calculation of the shell correction energy is based on the strutinsky energy theorem @xcite which states that the total quantal energy can be divided in two parts : @xmath106 the largest piece @xmath107 is the average part of the energy which depends in a smooth way on the number of nucleons ( namely , the part well represented by the liquid droplet model ) . the smaller piece , the shell correction @xmath108 , has instead an oscillating behaviour .",
    "the oscillations are due to the grouping of levels into shells and display maxima at the shell closures . according to the idea of strutinsky ,",
    "the average part of the ground - state energy of a shell model potential can be obtained by replacing the hartree - fock occupation numbers @xmath109 ( 1 or 0 for occupied or empty states ) with occupation numbers @xmath110 smoothed by an averaging function @xcite .",
    "the shell correction @xmath108 is computed as the difference of the exact energy to that average part .",
    "the strutinsky smoothing procedure requires the use of several major shells .",
    "this faces the problem of the treatment of the continuum when realistic finite depth potentials are employed @xcite .",
    "our strategy here , working in coordinate space , and consistently with our approach to the treatment of pairing , is to perform the strutinsky smoothing including the quasibound levels which are retained by their centrifugal barrier ( centrifugal - plus - coulomb barrier for protons ) .",
    "we have taken 7 major shells above the fermi energy ( i.e. , states up to around 50 mev above the fermi level ) and have considered curvature corrections up to @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "we have found that the plateau condition of the averaged energy @xcite is fulfilled for a smoothing parameter @xmath112 mev for both protons and neutrons .",
    "as we have discussed , the quasibound levels included in our calculation do not depend on the size of the box where the calculation is performed .",
    "these levels , usually with high angular momentum , lie close in energy to the rhb canonical levels @xcite .",
    "of course , one limitation of our approach is that some resonant levels with low angular momentum can be missed , more easily for neutrons , and then their contribution is shared among the higher angular momentum levels which we include in the calculation .    the total ( neutron - plus - proton ) shell corrections stemming from our calculations for the isotopic chains with @xmath6 and @xmath3 are displayed in figure 9 .",
    "the equivalent graph for the isotonic chains with @xmath2 , 184 , and 258 is presented in figure 10 .",
    "again , we point out that our calculation is performed in spherical symmetry and thus the calculated shell corrections represent in general an upper bound to the actual ones .",
    "stronger shell stabilization could still be provided by deformation .",
    "the magnitude of the shell correction energy @xmath108 is dictated by the level density around the fermi level . a high level density in the vicinity of the fermi energy yields a positive shell correction reducing the binding energy , whereas a low level density gives a negative shell correction which increases the binding energy .",
    "the shell corrections obtained with the g2 and nl3 sets are rather similar for the investigated isotopic and isotonic chains .",
    "this is so because the single - particle levels around the fermi surface essentially show the same ordering with both parameter sets and there are only small differences in the spin - orbit splittings , as it can be realized from figures 4 and 8 .",
    "the results for the set g1 are also similar to those of g2 and nl3 and thus we do not display them in figures 9 and 10 .    in figure 9",
    "the isotopic chain of @xmath3 shows a large negative shell correction at @xmath2 , due to the presence of low angular momentun levels near the fermi energy for both neutrons ( 4s@xmath113 , 3d@xmath100 and 3d@xmath99 levels ) and protons ( 3p@xmath113 and 3p@xmath100 levels ) .",
    "these levels imply a comparatively lower level density and thus a more negative shell correction .",
    "the isotopic chain also shows another local minimum around @xmath114 , but in this case the shell correction energy is less negative than for @xmath2 .",
    "the pattern exhibited by the total shell correction for the @xmath3 isotopes looks very similar to that of the neutron shell correction displayed in figure 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the nl3 parameter set , which was computed by means of the green s function procedure .",
    "looking at the curves for the @xmath6 isotopic chain represented in figure 9 one realizes that the shell corrections are globally weaker than that for @xmath3 chain , which means less stability .",
    "they also present minima at @xmath2 and at @xmath5 , although in this case the situation is reversed and the largest corrections correspond to @xmath5 instead of @xmath2 .    in the upper panel of figure 10",
    "the shell corrections for the @xmath2 isotonic chain clearly show only one minimum at @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath5 chain ( middle panel ) displays one more local minimum at @xmath6 , though the magnitude of the shell correction obtained for @xmath6 is smaller than for @xmath3 .",
    "our total shell corrections for @xmath2 and @xmath5 show similar patterns to the proton shell corrections of nl3 which are depicted in figure 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite for these same isotonic chains .",
    "the curves of the shell correction for the @xmath4 hyperheavy nuclei ( lower panel of figure 10 ) are overall very much flat in comparison to those for the isotonic chains of @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "the absolute minimum again appears at @xmath3 .",
    "there is also a very small kink at @xmath6 .",
    "the comparison of the curves in the 3 panels reveals that at @xmath3 all the curves show the most prominent minima . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the shell corrections for @xmath2 have no dip at all , but they display a small kink for @xmath5 and @xmath4 .    from the analysis of the shell correction energy",
    "we see that the location of the minima in the shell stabilized regions of she is in good agreement with the conclusions about the shell closures that we inferred from the study of the previous indicators . due to the fact that the minima in the shell corrections for superheavy nuclei are often not very pronounced , but rather shallow , we note the usefulness of analyzing the shell corrections as a complementary means to assess the predictions made on the basis of the energy indicators .",
    "we have investigated the predictions of the g1 and g2 parametrizations of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained from the modern effective field theory approach to relativistic nuclear phenomenology for the occurrence of spherical double shell closures and the shell stabilizing effect in superheavy nuclei . within an isotopic or isotonic chain of she",
    "the possible shell closures are identified by a simultaneous occurrence at a given @xmath21 or @xmath20 of a large jump in the corresponding two - nucleon separation energy @xmath68 , a pronounced peak in the two - nucleon shell gap @xmath115 , and the vanishing of the average pairing gaps @xmath79 and @xmath75 . to treat the pairing correlations we have employed an improved bcs model that was used successfully in ref.@xcite in calculations of isotopic and isotonic chains with magic proton or neutron numbers .",
    "first we have studied the isotopic chain of @xmath3 , which is found to be a magic number in previous rmf calculations .",
    "neutron shell closures arise at @xmath2 and @xmath4 in all the considered parameter sets ( g1 , g2 and nl3 ) . in the particular case of the g2 set",
    "@xmath5 appears as another possible neutron shell closure , though it is not as robust as for @xmath2 or @xmath4 .",
    "the magic character of @xmath3 is supported by the fact that the average proton pairing gap vanishes along the whole isotopic chain .",
    "next we have investigated the isotonic chains with @xmath2 , 184 and 258 for @xmath116 . from this analysis the candidates",
    "to proton shell closures have been found to be @xmath6 ( weakly ) and @xmath3 ( strongly ) .",
    "other possible candidates different from @xmath6 and @xmath3 present a non - vanishing neutron pairing gap .",
    "we conclude that the parameter sets g1 and g2 derived from the effective field theory approach clearly point out towards the doubly - magic character of the ( @xmath93 ) and ( @xmath117 ) combinations , which is in agreement with the predictions of the nl3 set .",
    "a minimum condition for a superheavy nucleus to be stable against fission is that the shell effects must be able to provide enough binding to compensate for the huge coulomb repulsion among protons .",
    "compared to normal nuclei where the large negative shell corrections are peaked at the magic numbers , the she display broad areas of shell stabilization around the possible shell closures .",
    "we have computed the shell corrections for the analyzed superheavy nuclei by means of an strutinsky smoothing .",
    "the continuum has been parametrized by taking quasibound levels which in coordinate space are retained by their centrifugal barrier .",
    "we have found a region of shell stabilization for isotopes of @xmath6 and @xmath3 in the range of neutron numbers @xmath118 .",
    "the shell corrections are larger for @xmath3 than for @xmath6 , and in both cases show peaks at @xmath2 and @xmath5 which indicates the larger stability of these nuclei relative to their neighbors . for the isotonic chains of @xmath2 and @xmath5 the more negative shell corrections appear at @xmath3 , although a smaller peak shows up at @xmath6 pointing out the relatively stable character of this nucleus , at least compared with the immediate neighbors .",
    "the curve of the shell corrections for the isotones of @xmath4 is mostly flat , but again a depression can be recognized around @xmath3 .    to summarize , in previous works @xcite we showed that the parameter sets derived from the effective field theory approach to the low - energy nuclear many - body problem @xcite work nicely for both @xmath27-stable and @xmath27-unstable nuclei .",
    "this is in addition to their ability to yield a realistic equation of state at densities above saturation which compares very favorably with microscopic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations @xcite . in the present study",
    "we have applied the eft model to deal with the theoretical description of some properties of superheavy nuclei . in particular",
    ", we have seen that the g1 and g2 parameter sets reproduce the strong double shell closure at @xmath2 and @xmath3 predicted by the standard rmf parametrizations , as well as a double shell closure at @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly enough , the new parameter set g2 shows some evidence for a double shell closure of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 nucleus traditionally predicted by the macroscopic - microscopic models , as well as by the skyrme interaction ski4 .",
    "the results presented here are a first prospect of the performance of the eft model in the description of she .",
    "our calculations have been restricted to spherical shapes . as we have discussed , this is not an impeding drawback for the effects investigated in this work . however , for comparisons with the measured data on the heavier actinides and the experimentally synthesized she around @xmath7 , one definitively needs to perform deformed calculations .",
    "in the future it will be worthwhile trying to include deformation degrees of freedom into the eft model to extend the study to deformed nuclei of the she island .",
