    "it has long been known that graphite intercalated compounds ( gics ) can display a superconducting behavior at low temperature @xcite . however , until the discovery of ytterbium and calcium intercalated graphite @xcite ( t@xmath1(ybc@xmath0)=6.5 k and t@xmath1(cac@xmath0)=11.5 k ) , the critical temperatures achieved were typically inferior to 5 kelvin .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that even higher critical temperatures ( up to 15.1 k ) can be achieved in cac@xmath0 applying hydrostatic pressure ( up to 8 gpa)@xcite .",
    "this is presently the highest t@xmath1 reported in a gic .",
    "from a practical point of view gics are appealing since carbon is a very versatile element . beside the fact that the three most known carbon crystalline structures ( fullerene , graphite and diamond ) display superconducting behavior upon intercalation @xcite or doping@xcite , carbon is also interesting for the possibility of making nanotubes which can display a superconducting behavior @xcite .",
    "moreover the number of reagents which can be intercalated in graphite , by using chemical methods or high pressure synthesis , is very large . consequently finding gics with even higher critical temperatures is not a remote possibility .",
    "therefore theoretical calculations can be a precious tool for the investigation of superconductivity in gics .",
    "the nature of superconductivity in intercalated gics is still controversial . due to their layered nature and to the presence of an intercalant band at the fermi level ( e@xmath5 ) , csnyi _",
    "_ @xcite suggested a non - conventional exciton pairing mechanism @xcite . on",
    "the contrary mazin @xcite proposed an electron - phonon mechanism mainly sustained by ca vibration . in a previous work@xcite",
    "we suggested that the pairing is mediated by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "in particular the carriers are mostly electrons in the ca fermi surfaces coupled with ca in - plane and c - out of plane vibrations .",
    "the calculation of the isotope effect coefficient showed that the contribution of ca in - plane vibrations and c out - of - plane vibrations to superconductivity is comparable .",
    "experimental data seem to confirm that the pairing in cac@xmath0 and ybc@xmath0 is indeed due to the electron - phonon interaction , but several open questions remain . from the exponential behavior of the penetration depth in cac@xmath0 lamura _",
    "@xcite deduced an isotropic gap of magnitude @xmath6(0)=1.79@xmath7 0.08 mev .",
    "a similar isotropic gap ( @xmath6(0)=1.6@xmath7 0.2 mev ) has been measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath8 are in agreement with the bcs theory .",
    "similar conclusions have been obtained from the specific heat jump at superconducting transition@xcite .",
    "thermal conductivity data in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite indicate that in ybc@xmath0 the order parameter has s - wave symmetry too and exclude the occurrence of multiple gaps .",
    "isotope effect measurements @xcite show a huge ca isotope coefficient , @xmath9 , in disagreement with theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , since the gap and specific heat data are correctly described by dft calculations , meaning that the calculated electron - phonon coupling is probably correct .",
    "even more interesting is that the total isotope effect would be probably larger than 0.5 , although c - isotope effect measurements are necessary to confirm this and to judge the validity of the measurements of @xmath10 . in any case , the large ca - isotope coefficient , the measured superconducting gap and the jump of the specific heat at the transition they all go in favor of a phonon mediated mechanism with , most likely , a single s - wave gap .    in this work",
    "we want to push a step forward the prediction that can be made by the electron - phonon theory .",
    "this is important since it may allow to identify gics with higher critical temperatures and it also represents a significative benchmark for dft simulations .",
    "it was noted @xcite that all the superconducting gics possess an intercalant fermi surfaces at e@xmath5 .",
    "this fact is relevant for both pairing mechanisms proposed . in the case of a conventional electron - phonon mechanism",
    "the electrons in the intercalant fermi surface are the ones strongly coupled to the phonons @xcite .",
    "thus we study the possible occurrence of superconductivity in graphite intercalated with alkaline earths ( ac@xmath0 with a = ba , sr , mg ) .",
    "all these gics have an intercalant fermi surface at e@xmath5 so they are good candidates for superconductivity .",
    "we predict the critical temperatures for bac@xmath0 and src@xmath0 in the framework of the electron - phonon coupling theory .",
    "as mentioned before , the critical temperature of cac@xmath0 and ybc@xmath0 is enhanced with pressure .",
    "resistivity measurements under pressure show that , at @xmath11 8 gpa , cac@xmath0 undergoes a structural phase transition to a new superconducting phase with a lower critical temperature .",
    "the new structure seems to be stable at least up to 16 gpa . in other successive works magnetic@xcite and",
    "resistive @xcite measurements were performed in a much smaller range of pressures ( 0 - 1.6gpa ) and the behavior observed was confirmed .",
    "pressure also increases the critical temperature of ybc@xmath0 up to approximatively 7.0 k at @xmath112.0 gpa . in this case",
    "too a structural transition is seen towards a new superconducting phase with lower t@xmath1 . in both ybc@xmath0 and cac@xmath0",
    "the dependence of t@xmath1 is linear with similar @xmath12 ( 0.4 for ybc@xmath0 and 0.5 for cac@xmath0 ) .",
    "the fact that t@xmath1 can be enhanced with pressure suggests that this can be a general mechanism for superconducting in gics .",
    "it is then important to study superconductivity as a function of pressure in bac@xmath0,src@xmath0 and finally cac@xmath0 .    after illustrating in section [ sec : technical ] and [ sec : structures ] the technical parameters and the lattice structures used in the simulations , we study the electronic structure ( sec .

    "we use a @xmath18 and @xmath19 uniform k - point meshes and hermite - gaussian smearing ranging from 0.1 to 0.05 ry . in order to obtain very accurate phonon - frequencies for the low energy modes ( below 15 mev )",
    "it is crucial to use a large cutoff for the charge density ( 600 ry at least ) and a very high convergence threshold in the phonon calculations . for the evaluation of the electron - phonon coupling and of the electronic density of states we use @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 meshes respectively . for the @xmath22 average over the phonon momentum * q * we use a @xmath23 @xmath24points mesh .",

    "the increase of t@xmath1 has been confirmed by other two successive works measuring t@xmath1 in a much smaller range of pressure @xcite . at 8gpa",
    "the system seems to undergo a phase transition towards a different structure with a lower superconducting t@xmath1 .        .",
    "[ fig : breanchiecac60 - 5gpa ]    to study the behavior of t@xmath1 under pressure we calculate the phonon dispersion and the electron - phonon coupling at 5gpa , for which a t@xmath36 was detected in experiments .",
    "the comparison between the phonon dispersions at 0gpa and 5gpa is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : breanchiecac60 - 5gpa ] . as can be seen , while the lowest ca phonon mode is slightly softened ( mostly at x ) , the others ca and c@xmath37 phonon modes are hardened .",
    "however the overall change is fairly small and the eliashberg functions @xmath38 at 0 and 5gpa have no sizable differences ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha2fcap ] ) . at higher pressures",
    "the phonon frequencies become imaginary , similarly to what happens in src@xmath0 at 16.5gpa . in particular",
    "the largest softening occurs at x for the lowest ca mode and it becomes negative in the range of 7 - 10 gpa .",
    "the lowest phonon frequency at x is extremely dependent on the hermite - gaussian smearing used in the calculation and as a consequence much larger k - point mesh must be used to correctly identify the phase transition ( using a 10x10x10 mesh and smearing 0.04 still gives results which are not converged ) .",
    "however it is clear that at a sufficient high pressure the system will become unstable and the lowest ca phonon frequency at x will approach zero .    more insight on the superconducting properties can be gained by computing @xmath39 and @xmath22 at 0 and 5 gpa . in this range of pressures",
    "these parameters have very similar values and consequently the critical temperature changes only slightly ( see table [ tab : scpressgics ] ) , from 11.03 k at 0gpa to 11.40 k at 5gpa .        .",
    "[ fig : alpha2fcap ]    the calculation for t@xmath1 under pressure are in stark disagreement with a recent theoretical calculation@xcite obtained using the same method ( dft ) and the same code .    the disagreement with the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite can be explained by the following . in ref .",
    "@xcite the electron - phonon coupling is calculated close to the structural transition ( at 10gpa ) where the ca phonon frequency strongly softens . just before the structural transition , @xmath40 and consequently @xmath41 . in this",
    "limit ( close to the transition),_the behavior is highly non linear_. on the contrary in ref.@xcite the behavior is assumed linear between 0gpa and 10gpa @xcite .",
    "our calculation at 5.0 gpa giving essentially the same t@xmath1 as at 0 gpa shows that this is not the case .",
    "we remark that in the calculation of the electron - phonon coupling at 0 and 5gpa it is crucial to use at least a 4@xmath424@xmath424 q - point mesh .",
    "if the smaller @xmath43 mesh is used , the electron - phonon coupling of the ca modes is overestimated , since the point at x ( which is included in the mesh and has a considerable electron - phonon coupling ) has a too large weight .",
    "the consequent increase of t@xmath1 under pressure is much larger than in the @xmath44 mesh .    from the preceding discussion it follows that dft calculations give a non linear behavior of t@xmath1 versus pressure , in stark disagreement with experiments .",
    "in particular the increase of t@xmath1 as a function of pressure is too weak when compared with experiments . in the next section",
    "we discuss what can be the origin of such disagreement .",
    "in this work we theoretically investigated the occurrence of superconductivity in graphite intercalated with alkaline earths ( in particular ba , sr , ca , mg ) .",
    "most of these systems have been already synthesized ( bac@xmath0,src@xmath0 and cac@xmath0 ) , while mgc@xmath0 has been proposed@xcite as a good candidate for superconductivity due to its light mass and small force constants , possibly leading to large electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we predict the critical temperatures of bac@xmath0 and src@xmath0 to be 0.23 k and 3.02 k respectively .",
    "moreover we also predict a substantial increase in the critical temperature under pressure for these two systems , namely at 8 gpa the critical estimated temperatures for bac@xmath0 and src@xmath0 are 0.81 k and 5.16 k respectively .",
    "we hope that these predictions can stimulate additional experimental work so that the nature of the pairing in gics can be further elucidated",
    ". moreover it would be important to judge the reliability of dft in calculating the superconducting properties of different gics .",
    "indeed , while superconducting gap and specific heat measurements are in very good agreement with dft calculations the only available measure of the ca isotope effect @xcite in cac@xmath0 is in stark disagreement with dft predictions @xcite .",
    "the claim that the isotope effect coefficient of ca is 0.5 , if verified by the corresponding measurement of the c isotope effect , would open new perspectives .",
    "we have also shown that mgc@xmath0 is energetically unstable against phase separation in mg and graphite . moreover , even assuming that it can be synthesized using pressure methods , the minimized structure at zero pressure obtained using dft has imaginary phonon frequencies at the point x. nonetheless it is interesting to note that the softening at the point x occurs when the interlayer spacing is reduced in cac@xmath0 and is connected to a large electron - phonon coupling in this point .",
    "this information suggests that the t@xmath1 of cac@xmath0 can probably be raised synthesizing mg@xmath2ca@xmath3c@xmath4 alloys .",
    "concerning cac@xmath0 , a puzzling problem is the dependence of the critical superconducting temperature upon pressure .",
    "experimentally t@xmath1 increases as a function of pressure , but as we have shown in this work , t@xmath1 increases much faster than what dft calculations predict .",
    "further work is necessary to explain the origin of this disagreement , mainly on the experimental side .",
    "indeed diffraction data as a function of pressure are absolutely necessary .",
    "if there is a phase transformation upon pressure , the structure minimized with dft at finite pressure would not be correct .",
    "the fact that the tc versus pressure curves are very smooth seems to exclude an abrupt transition .",
    "a possibility is that a staging transition occurs in cac@xmath0 under pressure .",
    "this transition could be continuous , meaning that the staging occurs progressively in the sample .",
    "it is indeed well known that gics are extremely sensitive to these kind of transitions occurring isothermally under very modest pressures .",
    "for example kc@xmath45 , which is a stage 2 gic , starts a staging transition at 2.5 kbar versus a stage 3 structure .",
    "the transition is continuous and completely achieved at @xmath11 6.5 kbar@xcite .",
    "similar transitions have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for mc@xmath46 and mc@xmath47 ( n=2,3,4 ) with m = rb , cs .",
    "if such a transition occurs in cac@xmath0 then it would not necessarily show up in the t@xmath1 versus pressures curves , but it would explain the disagreement between experiment and theory .",
    "of course other more complicate explanations are possible , including unconventional superconductivity . in all the case , the origin of superconductivity in intercalated gics is not yet completely understood .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussion with a. gauzzi , g. loupias , m. dastuto , n. emery , c. herold and l. boeri .",
    "calculations were performed at the idris supercomputing center ( project 061202 )                                                  the results for src@xmath0 at 16.5 gpa should be considered only qualitative since much larger q- and k - points mesh should be used . moreover very close to the structural instability anharmonic effects might become relevant ."
