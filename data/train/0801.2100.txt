    "the claimed relationship between accretion rate , @xmath5 , and mass , @xmath6 , in pre - mainsequence stars ( e.g. natta , testi & randich 2006 and references therein ) originates from the more direct observational result that in class ii pre - mainsequence stars the accretion luminosity , @xmath0 , is similarly found to correlate with stellar luminosity , @xmath7 .",
    "the accretion luminosity is deduced from the luminosity in the emission lines of hydrogen ( in natta et al . , 2006 ,",
    "these are pa@xmath8 and br@xmath9 ) , together with modeling of the emission process ( natta et al .",
    "2004 ; calvet et al .",
    "the modeling appears to be relatively robust . in order to deduce the quantities",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 from the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath7 , it is necessary to be able to deduce the stellar properties .",
    "this is done by placing the object in a hertzsprung - russell diagram and making use of theoretical pre - mainsequence tracks for non - accreting stars ( e.g. dantona & mazzitelli 1997 ) .",
    "the result of this exercise indicated a correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is close to @xmath12 .",
    "the simplest theoretical expectation ( in the case of disc accretion where neither the fraction of material in the disc nor the disc s viscous timescale scale systematically with stellar mass ) is instead that @xmath13 .",
    "the claimed steeper than linear relationship thus motivated a variety of theoretical ideas about specific scalings of disc parameters with stellar mass ( alexander & armitage 2006 , dullemond et al 2006 ) .",
    "clarke & pringle ( 2006 ) however suggested that the claimed correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 could be understood as follows .",
    "they noted that the distribution of datapoints in the plane of @xmath7 versus @xmath0 ( figure 1 ) more or less fills a region that is bounded , at high @xmath0 by the condition @xmath14 and , at low @xmath0 , by observational detection thresholds , which roughly follow a relation of the form @xmath15 .",
    "they noted that when this relation between @xmath0 and @xmath16 is combined with specific assumptions about the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and between @xmath7 and stellar radius @xmath17 ( based on placing the stars on pre - mainsequence tracks at a particular age , or narrow spread of ages ) then the resulting relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is indeed @xmath18 .",
    "they thus claimed that it is currently impossible to reject the possibility that the claimed , steeper than linear , relationship is an artefact of detection biases .",
    "clarke & pringle ( 2006 ) also pointed out that the distribution of detections in the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath7 plane may nevertheless be used to tell us something about conventional accretion disc evolutionary models . in this paper",
    "we explore the extent to which this might be achieved . the first question which needs to be addressed",
    "is why there is a spread of values of @xmath0 at a given value of @xmath7 .",
    "secondly we need to understand _ why _ the upper locus of detections corresponds to @xmath19 , since there seems no obvious reason why this should correspond to a detection threshold or selection effect .",
    "we begin here ( section 2 ) by setting out a simple argument why  as a generic property of accretion from a disc with mass much less than the stellar mass  one would expect the distribution to be bounded by the condition @xmath19 .",
    "in section 3 we use the ideas of hartmann , cassen & kenyon ( 1997 ) to develop an approximate evolutionary code for accreting pre - mainsequence stars and demonstrate its applicability by comparison with the tracks of pre - mainsequence stars computed by tout , livio & bonnell ( 1999 ) .",
    "in section 4 we apply the code to pre - mainsequence stars accreting from an accretion disc with a declining accretion rate and investigate the range of disc parameters required to obtain the observed range of @xmath20 .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "from a theoretical point of view there are three relevant timescales in the case of star gaining mass by accretion from a disc .",
    "the first is    @xmath21    which is the current timescale on which the stellar mass is increasing .",
    "the second is    @xmath22    which is the current timescale on which the disc mass is decreasing .",
    "the third is the kelvin - helmholtz timescale    @xmath23    which is the timescale on which the star can radiate its thermal energy .",
    "it is also the timescale on which a star can come into thermal equilibrium . on the pre - main sequence , when the luminosity of the star is mainly due to its contraction under gravity , @xmath24 is also the evolutionary timescale .",
    "we see immediately ( since @xmath25 ) that    @xmath26    the pre - mainsequence stars in which we are interested , class  ii ( the classical t  tauri stars ) , all have the following properties :    \\(i ) they have passed through the major phase of mass accretion which occurs during the embedded states class 0 and class i. this implies typically that they have been evolving for some time with their own gravitational energy as the major energy source .",
    "deuterium burning interrupts this briefly but only delays contraction by a factor of 2 or so .",
    "thus for these stars we may expect that they have an age @xmath27 roughly .",
    "\\(ii ) the masses of their accretion discs are now small , @xmath28 .",
    "further , accretion disc models at such late stages ",
    "i.e. the so called asymptotic stage when most of the mass that was originally contained in them has been accreted on to the central object  exhibit a power law decline in @xmath29 with time and thus have the generic property that the age of the disc is about @xmath30 .",
    "if most of the star s lifetime has been spent accreting in this asymptotic regime , we may roughly equate the age of the disc and the age of the star and write @xmath31 .",
    "given this , we see immediately that , for these stars , we expect @xmath32 and therefore that @xmath33 .    in the following section we test this argument by evolving a suite of model star - disc systems in the @xmath34 plane .",
    "rather than attempting to carry out full stellar evolution computations of accreting and evolving pre - mainsequence stars ( e.g. tout et al .",
    "1999 ) , we here adopt the simplified approach of hartmann , cassen & kenyon ( 1997 ) .",
    "we begin with a stellar core of mass @xmath35 and radius @xmath36 .",
    "we prescribe the accretion rate @xmath37 and thus the stellar mass as a function of time    @xmath38    hartmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) write the energy equation as    @xmath39 \\ ,   + \\ , l_d.\\ ] ]    in deriving this equation they assume that the star is always in hydrostatic balance and , being fully convective , can be treated as an @xmath40 polytrope .",
    "account is taken of the conversion of gravitational energy into thermal energy via @xmath41 work as well energy input from deuterium burning @xmath42 and energy loss via radiative cooling at the photosphere @xmath43 . in the form written",
    "above , it is assumed that the material accreting on to the star arrives with zero thermal energy .",
    "this is probably a good approximation to the case where material enters the star via a radiative magnetospheric shock or from a disc boundary layer .",
    "the rate of energy input to the star delivered by deuterium burning is parameterised ( following the expression given by stahler 1988 for an @xmath40 polytrope ) by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the mass fraction of hydrogen and @xmath46 is the fraction of deuterium remaining in the star relative to the accreted material .",
    "we assume that the accreted material has the same abundance as the star before deuterium begins burning and we take this initial mass fraction to be @xmath47 as did tout et al .",
    "we fix the hydrogen mass fraction at @xmath48 .. we recover their @xmath49 in equation  ( [ deut ] ) with @xmath47 . ]    the variation of @xmath46 is given by ( equivalent to stahler 1988 ) .    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the energy available from fusion of deuterium .",
    "because of timestep problems we set @xmath52 once the value of @xmath46 falls below some small value @xmath53 . except where explicitly mentioned , we take @xmath54 .    for a fully convective star , the stellar entropy is controlled by the outer ( photospheric ) boundary condition which takes account of the strong temperature sensitivity of the surface opacity for stars on the hayashi track .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) adopt a fit to the ( non - accreting ) stellar evolutionary tracks of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) in the form    @xmath55    they stress that this fit is only approximate and is adequate only in the mass range @xmath56 .    in order to provide some estimate of the accuracy of this simplified evolutionary scheme , we compared the results against the full stellar evolution calculations of tout et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , for the case of constant accretion rate ( having first satisfied ourselves that stars in the appropriate mass range in tout et al are indeed well fit by the parameterisation of the photospheric condition given by ( 9 ) ) .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , for accretion rates @xmath57 and  @xmath58 . on each track ( where possible ) we plot the point",
    "at which the stellar mass is @xmath59 and  @xmath60 together with the corresponding points on the tracks .",
    "both sets of computations had the same initial values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the stars first descend a hayashi track , while being driven across to higher effective temperature by the accreting matter .",
    "when the core temperature reaches about @xmath63k they evolve up the deuterium - burning main sequence .",
    "once deuterium fuel is exhausted they resume their descent towards the zero - age main sequence , leaving their hayashi tracks when the stellar luminosity drops to the point that the kelvin timescale becomes greater than the accretion timescale . at this point ,",
    "accretion is again important and the tracks are then driven to higher effective temperatures .",
    "up to these points our simplified model appears to be in reasonably good agreement with tout et al ( 1999 ) s models , even at early times and low masses , when the equations are formally incorrect .",
    "all the points are accurate to within a factor of two in luminosity and to within 10 per cent in effective temperature .",
    "we conclude that this simplified model is adequate for the task in hand .",
    "in view of our ignorance about formation history of pre - mainsequence stars in terms of their accretion history , we need to make some assumptions about the form of @xmath37 . in doing so",
    ", we are guided by some simple physical ideas .",
    "it needs to be borne in mind , however , that although our simple assumptions give rise to results which provide a reasonable description of the data , this does not imply that the assumptions are necessarily correct nor that they are the only ones which might work .",
    "we assume that most of the mass which has accreted on to a t tauri star has been processed through an accretion disc .",
    "this assumption , coupled with the observational fact that protostellar discs are at most 10  20 per cent of the stellar mass and usually much less , tells us that the evolution of the accretion disc has progressed into its late , asymptotic phase .",
    "lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ; see also hartmann et al .",
    "1988 ) present similarity solutions for accretion disc evolution using the simple assumption that the kinematic viscosity varies as a power law of radius .",
    "they find that for such discs , the disc accretion rate varies at late times as a power law in time with @xmath64 , for some @xmath65 .",
    "this is true more generally for discs in which the viscosity also varies as powers of local disc properties , such as surface density ( pringle 1991 ) .",
    "here we take @xmath66 , corresponding to kinematic viscosity being proportional to radius ( hartmann et al . 1988 ) .",
    "we assume that t  tauri stars only become visible at a time @xmath67 after the onset of formation and take @xmath68yr .",
    "we consider four sets of models in terms of the disc mass fraction @xmath69 at time @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the final stellar mass .",
    "we consider @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in order to stay within the credibility limits of our evolutionary scheme we consider final masses only in the range @xmath74 .",
    "we also need to define the stellar accretion rate from time @xmath75 . at @xmath75",
    "we start with @xmath76 . in principle , the evolution of the star for @xmath77 can depend critically on the accretion rate prior to this point .",
    "this is simply because the evolution timescale for a pre - mainsequence star is always comparable to its age , so that it has never had time to forget its initial conditions . in order to minimise this effect , we assume that the accretion rate does not increase with time .",
    "this is probably reasonable for stars which form in isolation ( e.g. shu , adam & lizano 1987 ) , but may not be valid for more dynamical modes of star formation , when late interaction and merging may be normal ( e.g. bate , bonnell & bromm 2002 ) . to be specific",
    "we assume that the accretion rate is of the form @xmath78 and that @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are chosen to ensure that the integral of @xmath5 between zero and infinity is @xmath82 and that the integral of @xmath5 from @xmath70 to infinity is @xmath83 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we note that , since @xmath84 , the disc is always in the asymptotic regime at the stage that it is classified as a t tauri star .",
    "we stress that the form of the evolutionary prescription that we have adopted for @xmath85 prior to @xmath70 is not the only one that produces a given disc and stellar mass at @xmath70 and that - depending on the temporal history and location of matter infall onto the disc - a variety of prior histories , with the same integrated mass , are possible .",
    "our intention here is however not to explore all possibilities but to adopt a plausible and easily adjustable prescription with which one can investigate the system s evolution in the @xmath86 plane .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "3 we show the results of these computations showing the accretion luminosity ( @xmath0 ) as a function of stellar luminosity ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we plot results for two final masses @xmath87 and @xmath88 and for the four initial disc mass fractions @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we plot the positions starting at time @xmath91yr and then at intervals of @xmath92yr until time @xmath93yr . in table 1",
    "we give the values of @xmath80 and of @xmath81 corresponding to these parameters .",
    "we note that in all our models @xmath94 ; thus , by the time that the star is deemed to be a classical t tauri star , the accretion rate has been declining as a power law over the majority of the system s lifetime .    from fig .",
    "3 we see that our data points more or less fill the range @xmath95 in the range of values of @xmath7 which are accessible to our computations .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that with a more detailed evolutionary scheme , valid at lower masses , this trend would continue to lower values of @xmath7 .",
    "thus these simple assumptions , coupled with this simplified evolutionary scheme are capable of producing the typical observed spread of points in the @xmath96 diagram ( see fig .  1 ) .    the stars in fig",
    "3 are evolving at essentially constant mass because , by assumption , @xmath97 and have already consumed all of their initial deuterium . at constant mass ,",
    "equation  [ photobc ] gives @xmath98 . for a star evolving on the kelvin - helmholtz timescale",
    "this implies @xmath99 and thus that @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath101 and we have assumed @xmath102 we have @xmath103 .",
    "from this we deduce that as time varies , we have approximately @xmath104 for @xmath66 this is @xmath105 .",
    "thus the slope of the tracks in fig .",
    "3 is a result of the ratio of the rates at which the star and the accretion disc evolve .",
    "owing to the photospheric boundary condition this ratio just depends on @xmath106 .",
    "it might be thought suggestive that the relation @xmath107 ( which holds in the case @xmath66 , at least over the range of @xmath7 for which ( 9 ) is valid ) , is very close to the mean relationship in the observational data .",
    "it is then tempting to see this as observational support for a viscosity law with this value of the power law index .",
    "however , we stress that when we experimented with a different viscosity law , which changed the slope of the individual stellar trajectories according to equation ( 12 ) , the distribution of stars in the @xmath108 plane was indistinguishable , filling , as it did , the available parameter space between @xmath19 and observational detection thresholds .",
    "we note that at fixed @xmath7 there is a trend for lower values of @xmath0 to correspond to lower values of @xmath109 , the disc mass fraction at the time when the star is deemed to appear as a classical t  tauri star .",
    "thus in this picture the spread of values of @xmath20 at fixed @xmath7 comes about because of the spread of disc masses at late times .",
    "such a spread could be due to a number of reasons such as a range of initial disc sizes ( i.e. initial angular momenta ) or a variety of disc truncations caused by dynamical interactions .",
    "there is also a trend for lower values of stellar mass @xmath6 to correspond to lower values of @xmath7 .",
    "it is evident , however , that the tracks in this diagram intermingle to some extent . at the times",
    "plotted @xmath97 , so each track corresponds essentially to a fixed stellar mass .",
    "thus it is clear that at a given value of @xmath7 there can be a spread of stellar masses depending on the assumed stellar age .",
    "we have shown , using simplified stellar evolution calculations for stars subject to a time dependent accretion history , that a plausible morphology of the @xmath110 plane for t  tauri stars has the following features ,    \\(i ) an upper locus corresponding to @xmath111 and    \\(ii ) diagonal tracks for falling accretion rates as stars descend hayashi tracks .",
    "we have argued that ( i ) is a generic feature of stars which are accreting from a disc reservoir with mass less than the central star coupled with the assumption that the mass depletion timescale of the disc is comparable to the age of the star .. the first is necessary for stars to be classified as classical t  tauri stars while the second results from the gradual decay of the accretion rate .",
    "we show that the slope of of the diagonal tracks ( ii ) is related to the index of the power law decline of accretion rate with time at late times .",
    "this itself depends on the scaling of viscosity with radius in the disc . for reference ,",
    "if @xmath112 , then @xmath105 along such tracks , whereas if @xmath113 then @xmath114 .    we however argue that , as long as observational datapoints appear to fill the whole region of the @xmath34 plane that is bounded by the upper limit ( i ) and luminosity dependent sensitivity thresholds , it will remain impossible to deduce what viscosity law or what dependence of disc parameters on stellar mass will be required in order to populate this region .",
    "this is because of the severe degeneracies that exist between stellar mass , age and accretion history ( our results show that in order to populate the desired region , it is necessary that there is , at the least , a spread in both stellar mass and initial disc properties ) .",
    "it is not , however , necessary to posit any particular scaling of disc properties with stellar mass in order to populate the plane , in contrast to the hypotheses of alexander & armitage 2006 and dullemond et al 2006 .",
    "likewise , although , as noted above , the trajectories followed by individual stars in this plane are a sensitive diagnostic of the disc viscosity law , this information is washed out in the case of an ensemble of stars which simply fill this plane .",
    "we therefore conclude that such data could only yield useful insights if regions of the plane turned out to be unpopulated ( or very sparsely populated ) . there is a shadow of a suggestion in figure 1 that at low @xmath7 the data falls further below the locus @xmath115 than at higher luminosities although",
    ", given the sample size , this difference is not statistically significant ( clarke & pringle 2006 ) . any such edge in the distribution could in principle re - open the possibility of constraining disc models .",
    "we however emphasise that this low luminosity regime can in any case not be explored by the simple evolutionary models that we employ here , and that  if it becomes necessary to investigate this regime  it will be essential to use full stellar evolution calculations .    finally , we note that we have chosen to relate our study to observational data in the @xmath116 plane because the ratio of these quantities is straightforwardly derivable from emission line equivalent widths .",
    "thus this comparison is more direct than the alternative , i.e. the comparison with observational data that has been transformed into the plane of @xmath117 versus @xmath6 via the use of isochrone fitting and the application of theoretical mass - radius relations .",
    "it is nevertheless worth noting that the upper locus of @xmath118 corresponds to a line with @xmath119 .",
    "although it is often taken as self - evident that this is the expected ratio ( in the case that the maximum initial ratio of disc mass to stellar mass is independent of stellar mass ) , this actually only corresponds to @xmath119 in the case that the disc s initial viscous time is independent of stellar mass .",
    "given the possible variety of viscosity values and radii of protostellar discs it is not at all evident that these should conspire together to give the same viscous timescale  until , that is , that one realises that all discs in the asymptotic regime have viscous timescale which is equal to the disc age .",
    "the conclusion that the upper locus should follow the relation @xmath119 is thus a very general one .    in summary",
    ", we conclude , as in the study of clarke & pringle ( 2006 ) , that the observed population of the @xmath120 plane , and the consequent relationship between @xmath29 and @xmath6 , is strongly driven by luminosity dependent sensitivity thresholds and an upper locus at @xmath121 .",
    "the main new ingredient injected by our numerical calculations and plausibility arguments is that we now understand that this observed upper locus can be understood as a consequence of plausible accretion histories , given the current properties of the relevant pre - mainsequence stars .",
    "in addition , our computations indicate the range of initial disc properties that are required in order to populate the region of parameter space occupied by observational datapoints : we are able to reproduce the observed range of values of @xmath20 at a given value of @xmath7 by assuming once the t  tauri phase has been reached , the disc mass fractions lie roughly in the range @xmath122 , independent of stellar mass .",
