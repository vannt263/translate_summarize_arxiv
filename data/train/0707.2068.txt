    "binary bound states are seen to exist in lattice simulations above @xmath1 and are also predicted @xcite using lattice interparticle potentials .    since a complete quantum description tends to rely on perturbative methods other approaches have to be adopted in order to perform calculations at strong coupling .",
    "one approach as was discussed in @xcite , is to model the strongly interacting quark and gluon quasiparticles as a classical non - relativistic colored coulomb gas .",
    "this model is analyzed using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in which real time correlators can be extracted .",
    "the interaction between quarks was taken as a coulomb potential with a strong repulsive core in order to _ mock up _ quantum - mechanical effects .",
    "a second example is a model treating charmonium in the sqgp @xcite , where initial ensembles of quark pairs from pqcd events are evolved classically according to a langevin model with an additional interaction potential included between quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the interaction potential was taken from lattice @xmath2 internal energy data with quantum - mechanical effects mimicked by simply turning off the potential below the approximate bohr radius .",
    "if these models are to be refined it is necessary that we consider quantum - mechanical effects more carefully .",
    "the construction of an effective interaction which mimics the effects of quantum dynamics was first performed by kelbg @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to generate classical effective @xmath3 potentials which take into account quantum - mechanical effects , first the dynamics and then the symmetry or anti - symmetry which must exist in the wavefunction for the @xmath4 pair .",
    "we want to find an effective potential @xmath5 whose @xmath6 boltzmann factor yields the diagonal term of the @xmath7 density matrix : @xmath8 for example , if this corrected interaction were used in the modeling of charmonium discussed in the previous paragraph , the final equilibrium distribution obtained by the fokker - planck evolution would be the correct quantum - mechanical distribution .",
    "this would obviously improve estimates for the intermediate states as well .",
    "these effective interactions would also have use in the md simulations discussed earlier .    in this work",
    "we calculate effective quark - antiquark potentials from the internal energy of static @xmath9 pairs calculated in @xcite based on lattice calculations of the @xmath9 @xmath10 energy in @xcite .",

    "now we focus on the problem at hand , obtaining an effective potential appropriate for simulations of heavy flavor quarks or plasma quasiparticles .",
    "internal and free energies for static quark - antiquark pairs have been calculated at temperatures above deconfinement @xcite , and either of these energies could be used to construct an effective interaction .",
    "however , it is not clear which potential would best be used in the simulation of dynamical heavy quarks .",
    "shuryak and zahed @xcite have argued that the rapid rotation of the quarks in bound states causes the timescales of interest to be relatively short , and therefore the appropriate energy for the interaction would be the internal energy .",
    "however , mocsy and petreczky @xcite , have found that potential models which use the free energy instead of the internal energy as the interaction potential best describe the spectral functions which were extracted from the euclidean correlators on the lattice using the maximal entropy method .",
    "while this does not yet rule out the argument of shuryak and zahed ( there is still significant uncertainty in the spectral function obtained using the maximal entropy method ) , it clearly establishes that at the time of this publication , there is no clear answer concerning which potential best describes the interaction between heavy quarks .    with no specific bias towards the use of either energy for describing the interaction",
    ", we will consider the internal energy .",
    "we parameterize the internal energy in the temperature range @xmath89 as follows :    @xmath90    this potential is similar in form to the screened cornell potential as first proposed in @xcite .",
    "the first part of the potential is the usual screened coulomb potential with temperature dependent coupling ( @xmath91 ) and debye mass ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "these values were extracted from the lattice data and parameterized as follows . for the coupling",
    "constant we use a form similar to that from the leading log order renormalization group equation , @xmath93^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the fit to the debye mass goes as @xmath94 which is consistent with the lowest - order perturbative calculations @xcite with additional corrections to account for the data better : @xmath95 .",
    "the second part of the potential takes on the same form as a screened linear confining potential .",
    "we choose a different functional form than the usual @xmath96 in order that the potential remains flat at intermediate and large distances instead of having a maximum and then becoming repulsive at larger @xmath97 as in the case of the cornell potential .",
    "we find that a parameterization of the _ string tension _ as @xmath98 reproduces the lattice data reasonably well across a large range of temperatures .",
    "the final parameters are @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the potential we use is then given as : @xmath101    subtracting away the internal energy at @xmath102 is convenient when we use the bpl convention for the bound state projection operator @xmath103 .",
    "the results of the fit to the internal energy compared to the lattice data as well as the resulting potentials is shown in fig  [ fig : potlat ] .",
    "any parametrization of the lattice results for the heavy quark potentials will be strongly dependent on temperature .",
    "so far , we have only considered creating effective potentials from temperature - independent potentials ( for example , the coulomb potential ) .",
    "starting from temperature - dependent potentials is straightforward .",
    "however , because there seems to be little discussion of this in the literature , we show how our results may be generalized to the temperature - dependent case",
    ".    consider the following partial differential equation , @xmath104 this equation is identical to the bloch equation ( eq .  [ eq : bloch ] ) but with the hamiltonian , @xmath105 , taken at the fixed temperature @xmath54 . because the potential in @xmath105 is at a fixed temperature ,",
    "the solution to [ eq : blochtemp ] is the same as before , @xmath106 by setting @xmath107 we find that the right - hand side is exactly the density matrix .",
    "therefore the prescription for a temperature - dependent hamiltonian is simple : fix the potential at the temperature of interest for all @xmath108 , then solve for the density matrix exactly as we have done in the previous sections ( _ i.e. _ either using the bloch equation or numerically with pimc methods ) .",
    "finally set @xmath109 .",
    "this example shows how the analogy between the matrix elements of a density matrix , and imaginary- time propagators , breaks down when the potential has temperature dependence .      using the lattice potential from the previous section",
    "the methods of section [ veff ] can be applied .",
    "do the previous results justify using the kelbg potential to approximate the effective @xmath9 potential ?",
    "well , since the divergent term in eq .",
    "[ eq : param ] is the screened coulomb term at small @xmath97 , we may work in units where @xmath110 .",
    "the question then is whether or not @xmath54 is sufficiently small in units of the bohr energy @xmath111 .",
    "the answer is yes , since in the extreme case where the bohr energy is the highest and the temperature is at the lowest ( near @xmath1 ) , we actually have @xmath112 , where our results for the coulomb case clearly show the kelbg potential working well down to @xmath113 .",
    "so we are confident that our methods will work well for the temperature range of interest .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc ] we show the results for @xmath83 for charmonium and bottomonium ( dotted blue and green lines respectively ) at a temperature @xmath114 . as in the coulomb case",
    "the effective potential takes on a finite value at @xmath115 .    .",
    "the dotted ( upper ) curves show @xmath87 and the solid ( lower ) curves show the result after the orthogonalization to the lowest bound state . ]",
    "it is also possible to include the effect of the lowest bound state as was done in the coulomb case .",

[ fig : bound ] . also shown in fig .  [ fig : bc ] as solid lines is the effective potential when the lowest bound state is included using the bpl formulation . at @xmath114 the effect of the bound state is to lower the potential by about 5% for charmonium and by about 15% for bottomonium .",
    "the effect is even smaller at higher temperatures .    in order for the results given above to be useful in future simulations we now quote some useful results for kelbg - like screened coulomb and linear potentials .",
    "we note that equation  [ eq : u1 ] can be integrated exactly in the case of a screened coulomb potential , @xmath117 with the result :    @xmath118\\ ] ]    and for a linear potential @xmath119 : @xmath120\\ ] ]    which can be used as an approximation to the _ confinement _ term in the lattice potential at small distances .",
