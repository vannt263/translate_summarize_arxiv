    "coupled surface and grain boundary motion is an important phenomenon controlling the grain growth in materials processing and synthesis .",
    "a commonly used model to study this coupled effect is called ",
    "quarter loop \" geometry introduced by dunn et al .",
    "@xcite .    in the quarter loop geometry",
    ", there are two grains between which there is an interface called grain boundary as shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the two grains are of the same material and differ only in their relative crystalline orientation .",
    "the grain boundary runs parallel to a free surface before it turns up and attaches to upper surfaces at a groove root .",
    "when heated at a specific temperature , the grain boundary migrates to reduce the surface energy and to heal the orientation mismatch . since the driving force is constant the grain boundary moves at a constant velocity after a short time decay .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the bicrystal is uniform along the cross - section direction .",
    "thus it is reasonable for us to consider only two dimensional(2d ) geometry in this paper .",
    "this geometry contains two types of motion .",
    "one of them is mean curvature motion for the grain boundary . and the other one is surface diffusion for the upper surfaces .",
    "more detail about this model is give in  @xcite .",
    "motion by mean curvature is an evolution law in which the normal velocity of an interface is proportional to its mean curvature .",
    "more precisely , the motion of an interface @xmath0 satisfies @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes the velocity in the normal direction of @xmath0 , and @xmath3 stands for the mean curvature of @xmath0 .",
    "first proposed by mullins  @xcite to model the curvature driven diffusion on the surface of a crystal , surface diffusion is a different evolution law in which the normal velocity of an interface is proportional to the surface laplacian of mean curvature .",
    "the motion of interface @xmath0 satisfies @xmath4 here @xmath5 stands for the normal velocity and @xmath6 stands for the operator of surface laplacian which is defined as @xmath7    in two dimensions , surface diffusion can be reduced to a normal direction motion with a speed function depending on the second derivative of the curvature with respect to arc length , i.e. , @xmath8 here @xmath9 is arc length parametrization .",
    "since the problem is proposed in two dimensions , the motion by surface diffusion always refers to equation ( [ eq : surdiff ] ) instead of the general case ( [ eq : q1 ] ) in this paper .",
    "we shall prove later in the appendix that we could normalize @xmath10 and @xmath11 by rescaling the time and space .",
    "since this reformulation make the problem neither harder or easier we will take both @xmath10 and @xmath11 as one .",
    "surface diffusion is an intrinsically difficult problem to solve numerically even in two dimensions .",
    "the main difficulty is that it is stiff due to the fourth order derivatives and such that an explicit time stepping strategy requires very small time steps .",
    "moreover , owing to the lack of a maximum principle , an embedded curve may not stay embedded , in other words , it may become self - intersected during the evolution .",
    "travelling wave solutions have been derived for the whole nonlinear problem and for a linearized problem in  @xcite and  @xcite respectively . these analytic results are used to verify numerical results in this paper .",
    "the formulations in this paper will be proposed in parameterized form .",
    "there are two reasons why we prefer the parameterized form .",
    "firstly , we try to set up a versatile formulation that is extensible to other problems , such as the evolution of a closed curve , other freely positioned triple junction problems and even the evolution curve networks , wherever for a single type motion or a mixed type motion .",
    "secondly , even for the coupled grain boundary motion , the function @xmath12 which represents the exterior surface may not be single - valued as shown in fig.[fig : exception ] and this phenomena is physically reasonable  @xcite . also for such consideration",
    "we will treat the exterior surface as two curves separated by the triple junction in the following discussion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ se:2 ] ,",
    "parabolic equations are derived for the motion by mean curvature and the motion by surface diffusion separately .",
    "the boundary conditions including the triple junction conditions and domain boundary conditions are discussed in section [ se:3 ] referring to the analytic work of novick - cohen et al .",
    "@xcite and wong et al .",
    "@xcite . in section [ se:4 ] , the well - posedness for a linear parabolic system that is closely related to the full nonlinear problem",
    "is analyzed and followed by a discussion about the artificial tangential condition . from section [ se:5 ]",
    "to [ se : tangential ] we discuss the numerical details including discretization , time stepping and some other numerical issues .",
    "we start the discussion for a pdae system in section [ se:8 ] .",
    "an interesting computational example of surface diffusion is given in section [ se : star ] .",
    "the linear well - posedness of the pdae system is analyzed in section [ se:9 ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the problem in the cartesian coordinate system which is give as below(see  @xcite ) .",

    "a numerical result is shown in fig.[fig : car ] .",
    "the disadvantage of using cartesian formulation is that it is not applicable to non - single valued case as shown in fig.[fig : exception ] .",
    "what s more , since the grain boundary is nearly singular at the junction , it requires very small grid size for accuracy . for wider application",
    "we consider two parametric formulations in the rest of this paper .",
    "in this section we derive a parabolic system to model the coupled motion . here and throughout this paper we use @xmath24 to represent a parameterized curve with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the coordinates .",
    "several more notations should be introduced as well .",
    "the arc length parameter is denoted by @xmath27 and any other parameter is denoted by @xmath28 . @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for unit tangential direction and unit normal direction respectively .",
    "@xmath3 stands for curvature .",
    "although all final equations are parameterized by @xmath31 , the arc length parametrization is useful for the intermediate deviations .",
    "we first derive a parabolic equation to describe the motion by mean curvature .",
    "similar discussion has been addressed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we give a brief description for reader s convenience .    with the notations introduced above one",
    "has @xmath32 @xmath33 here the subscript @xmath9 stands for the derivative of @xmath34 with respect to arc length @xmath9 .",
    "direct computation shows that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 which stands for the length of the curve from point @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is @xmath41 norm of @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 ) with respect to @xmath31 to botain @xmath44 by previous derivations one can compute the normal component of vector @xmath45 and obtains @xmath46 thus , if we set up a formulation : @xmath47 it is obvious that the motion described by ( [ eq : curvature1 ] ) has normal velocity @xmath3 .",
    "this gives us an option to describe the motion by mean curvature .",
    "equation ( [ eq : curvature1 ] ) is fully parabolic which means it is parabolic in both the normal component and tangential component .",
    "there are some other equations that can also describe curvature motion , for example , @xmath48 but this system is not fully parabolic .",
    "a linearization shows that this system is parabolic in the normal component and hyperbolic in the tangential component .",
    "a discretization of system ( [ eq : alternate ] ) will not have the good numerical properties as those of a fully parabolic system due to the lack of regularity in the parametrization as shown in  @xcite .",
    "considering the good properties of a parabolic formulation , we hope to find a parabolic formulation for motion by surface diffusion .",
    "by analogy with the approach to the mean curvature motion described above , we try the following form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 includes some lower order terms and will be determined such that @xmath51    we focus our study on finding out @xmath50 in the rest of this section .",
    "note first the following equation ( see appendix for proof ) , @xmath52 compare equation ( [ eq:145 ] ) and ( [ eq : ksss ] ) to get a choice for @xmath53 , @xmath54 one will find later that the fourth order terms appeared in ( [ eq : newl ] ) could be cancelled with each other and such that @xmath53 involves only third or lower order derivatives .",
    "start by equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) and differentiate several times with respect to @xmath31 to get following relations , @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 dividing through equation ( [ eq:16 ] ) by @xmath58 and noticing the fact that @xmath59 one obtains @xmath60 substitute equation ( [ eq:116 ] ) into ( [ eq : newl ] ) , rewrite arc length parametrization @xmath9 into @xmath31 using ( [ eq:17])-([eq:15 ] ) . since vector @xmath61 is perpendicular to @xmath30 and has no contribution to normal direction we can ignore all @xmath61 terms and obtain @xmath62    substitute equation ( [ eq : f ] ) back into ( [ eq:14 ] ) and collect to get the scheme as @xmath63    we would like to point out that the choice of @xmath53 is not unique .",
    "a similar expression has been given by garcke et al .",
    "in  @xcite .      we now give the fully parabolic system , @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for the grain boundary and @xmath66 stand for the left branch and right branch of the upper surface respectively .",
    "all curves are represented by @xmath39 with @xmath67 .",
    "this system will be solved numerically with the boundary conditions discussed in the next section .",
    "the grain boundary and the two upper surfaces meet together at one end which is referred as triple junction .",
    "the other end of the three curves tends to infinity in the quarter loop geometry . for numerical reasons ,",
    "we compute this problem in a bounded domain .",
    "this domain is chosen large enough such that it can simulate the motion at least for a short time .",
    "this restriction is reasonable since the curves are asymptotically flat for the parts far away from the triple junction .",
    "all computations presented in this paper are constrained in a finite domain @xmath68 $ ] and the curves are parameterized with @xmath69 $ ] .    at @xmath70",
    "the three curves meet at a triple junction and at @xmath71 the three curves meet the artificial domain boundary separately .",
    "we first discuss the boundary conditions at the triple junction .",
    "first of all , three curves should have common coordinates at @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath72    by young s law we have two more conditions which are referred as angle conditions : @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the angle between curve @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a constant measuring the relative surface energy between the grain boundary and exterior surface .",
    "the continuity of the surface chemical potentials implies that @xmath78 here the superscripts are indices of curves .",
    "and the balance of mass flux implies that @xmath79 where the expression for @xmath80 is obtained by taking the derivative of the expression of @xmath3 directly",
    ".    we must be careful about condition ( [ eq : potentials ] ) .",
    "basically , we need the two upper surfaces have the same convexity . since @xmath31 has opposite directions for the two curves the odd time derivatives will have opposite signs when computed by parametric form .",
    "thus we should put a minus sign for ( [ eq : potentials ] ) and keep the same for ( [ eq : mass ] ) .      at the other ends of the curves we put several artificial conditions such that they do not move during evolution and keep being flat .",
    "this is reasonable since they start being flat and they will not be influenced by the motion of the triple junction in a short time .",
    "the following conditions are imposed at @xmath71 , @xmath81      we should point out that the whole system contains two second order equations and four fourth order equations and it should have ten conditions at the junction point for well - posedness . recall that there are only eight junction conditions as have been addressed above .",
    "thus , we need two more conditions .",
    "there are several options to impose the extra conditions . and we will prove later that different conditions could only change the parametrization of the curves and will not change the profiles of the curves . since these conditions do change the tangential velocities of the grid nodes we refer them as artificial tangential conditions .",
    "as one of the options , the following two conditions are applied into the system : @xmath82",
    "in this section , we analyze the well - posedness of the system proposed above .",
    "we linearize around fixed straight line solutions and get a system that has the same highest order parabolic behavior as the original problem .",
    "the well - posedness we do gives the conditions that match those that in more complicated nonlinear analysis gives , where such analysis exists .",
    "and therefore , we believe the results of the analysis should apply to the full nonlinear problem .      to linearize the system we consider a perturbation expansion around the tangential direction at the triple junction for each curve , i.e. , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a constant vector standing for the unit tangential direction .",
    "substitute above equations into ( [ eq : sys ] ) , linearize and keep the leading order terms to get a linear system : @xmath85 for convenience , we omit the bar above @xmath34 in following discussion .",
    "the linearization of the triple junction conditions is straightforward .    *",
    "common point at @xmath70 : @xmath86 * angle conditions : @xmath87 * continuity of surface chemical potentials : @xmath88 * balance of mass flux : @xmath89 * artificial tangential conditions : @xmath90    the linear system ( [ eq : linearized ] ) can be solved using laplace transforms to get @xmath91 where @xmath92{s}\\quad \\lambda_2=(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i)\\sqrt[4]{s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and here @xmath9 temporally stands for the transformed time variable of laplace transform .    for simplicity ,",
    "we first suppose the angles between any two curves are @xmath93 .",
    "substituting solution ( [ eq : sol ] ) into boundary conditions one obtains a @xmath94 coefficient matrix @xmath95(transposed ) @xmath96    linear well - posedness requires that the determinant of matrix @xmath95 is nonsingular for any @xmath9 satisfying re@xmath97 .",
    "since the well - posedness depends only on their relative positions , we suppose further that @xmath98 with these assumptions , one obtains the determinant of @xmath95 : latexmath:[\\ ] ]    without changing the well - posedness of the problem we specify one of the tangential directions , say @xmath177 .",
    "further we assume @xmath178 since @xmath179 now the solution is changed to @xmath180 apply these solutions to boundary conditions to get an @xmath181 matrix @xmath95 and compute the determinant of @xmath95 directly to get @xmath182 for the special case when one of the angles @xmath183 is @xmath184 , for example , @xmath185 , @xmath186 the determinant of the coefficient matrix is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    and if both @xmath183 are @xmath184 , @xmath188 the corresponding determinant of the matrix @xmath95 is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    are well - posed if @xmath104 and @xmath190 .",
    "note that the well - posedness property here coincides with that for the parabolic system we got before .",
    "we proposed two formulations to describe the coupled surface and grain boundary motion .",
    "both of them are well - posed and easy to be implemented by finite difference method .",
    "numerical results are shown to be accurate .",
    "the pdae formulation behaves better than the parabolic form does . and",
    "since all grid points are equispaced for the pdae formulation it is convenient to regrid globally when necessary .",
    "this often happens when the curves expand or shrink quickly .",
    "it is obvious that these schemes can also be used to simulate the motion of a curve that involves only mean curvature motion or surface diffusion as shown in section [ se : star ] .",
    "and they are extensible to any normal direction motion .",
    "wherever applicable these methods are more efficient comparing to the level set methods .",
    "but they can not manage topology changes during the evolution .",
    "the authors would like to thank amy novick - cohen for the helpful information on recent progress about the model addressed in this paper .",
    "the original curvature motion and surface diffusion are given as @xmath191 without loss of generality will shall prove in particular in a parameterized form that we may normalize both @xmath10 and @xmath11 by rescaling the time and space .",
    "suppose the original motions are modelled by @xmath192 we first rescale the time by @xmath193 then equation ( [ eq : rescale ] ) becomes @xmath194 the spatial variable @xmath195 are rescaled as @xmath196 and we can easily verify that @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the arc length in the new system .",
    "more derivation shows that @xmath199 now equation ( [ eq : rescale2 ] ) becomes @xmath200 here we use the same notation @xmath30 since the normal direction does not change .",
    "if we choose @xmath201 then equation ( [ eq : rescale3 ] ) becomes @xmath202 this complete the normalization of coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "one has the following fact @xmath203 differentiating ( [ eq : kappa ] ) with respect to @xmath9 one obtains @xmath204 @xmath205 then an expression for @xmath206 can be derived , @xmath207 on the other hand , one has @xmath208 take derivative again and calculate the inner product of @xmath209 @xmath210 @xmath211 substitute equation ( [ eq:39 ] ) into ( [ eq:36 ] ) to get @xmath212 using equation ( [ eq:40 ] ) together with the fact that @xmath213 one obtains @xmath214 which completes the proof .",
