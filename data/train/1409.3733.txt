    "the phases of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at nonzero temperature ( @xmath0 ) and the quark - chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) are of much interest both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it has been established in lattice qcd with the physical quark masses that there does not exist a genuine phase transition at nonzero temperature and zero baryon density but only a rapid crossover from the hadronic state to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . in the cold and dense region",
    "@xmath2 , in contrast , reliable lattice simulations are still missing because of the notorious sign problem , although various attempts have been made @xcite .",
    "low - energy effective models of qcd @xcite tell us that there is a critical point ( cp ) at @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the critical line of the first - order phase transition in the low - temperature region terminates and that becomes second order @xcite .",
    "we mention that there can be variants or alternatives of the phase diagram with multiple or no critical points when the vector interaction @xcite , color superconductivity with and without charge neutrality and/or the anomaly terms are incorporated @xcite , even apart from the possibility of inhomogeneous phases @xcite .",
    "the global structure of the qcd phase diagram , including the identification of the cp , can be investigated experimentally using relativistic heavy ion collisions by comparing the collision events with different collision energies .",
    "an experimental program to perform such an investigation , called the beam energy scan program , is now ongoing at the relativistic heavy ion collider @xcite .",
    "the existence of the cp may be confirmed by the measurement of fluctuation observables in this program @xcite .",
    "experiments at the planned facilities at gsi , nica and j - parc would also contribute to reveal physical properties of the cp as well as the its existence .",
    "we emphasize here that the cp appears when the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken , and the identifications of the order parameter of the second - order transition and the associated soft modes are _ not _ simple and involved @xcite . in the chiral limit where the current @xmath5 quarks are massless , the order parameter _ is _ the chiral condensate , and the critical line of the first - order transition in the low - temperature region is connected at the _ tricritical point _ ( tcp ) with the critical line of the second - order transition ; the associated soft modes to the phase transition are the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the order parameter , which are identified with the sigma and the pionic modes , respectively @xcite .",
    "we notice that there is no scalar - vector coupling at the tcp due to the chiral symmetry .",
    "when the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken with the nonzero current quark masses , the second - order transition in the high - temperature region turns to a crossover and the sigma and pionic modes stay massive even at the cp : indeed the sigma mode has a mass @xmath6 around the cp with @xmath7 being the dynamically generated constituent quark mass .",
    "moreover , in such a case with an explicit chiral - symmetry breaking at @xmath8 , the scalar - vector cross - correlation term @xmath9 does not vanish , and , hence , the scalar mode is coupled with the density - density correlator @xmath10 @xcite ; this is because charge conjugation symmetry is violated with nonzero @xmath1 , and the left- and right - handed quarks are coupled owing to the breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the soft mode , the mass of which _ vanishes _ at the cp , is a superposition of the number - density fluctuation ( phonon ) and the sigma mode , and the qcd cp belongs to the same universality class as the liquid - gas phase transition , which is called  model h \" in the classification scheme by hohenberg and halperin @xcite : precisely speaking , the soft mode associated with the cp consists of not only the sigma and the phonon mode but also the entropy fluctuations , i.e. , the hydrodynamic modes @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate how the soft mode associated with the cp affects in turn the quark spectrum near the cp .",
    "we employ the simplest nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite without the vector coupling to describe the soft mode associated with the cp . in this model ,",
    "the collective mode in the scalar channel has a support in the spectral function not only in the timelike region but also in the spacelike region , the latter of which is composed of particle - hole excitations and describes the soft mode associated with the cp @xcite .",
    "it is known that the quarks coupled with the bosonic excitations at nonzero temperature show an unexpected rich structure in the spectral function , even apart from the formation of the celebrated plasmino excitations at extremely high temperatures as given in the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) approximation in gauge theories @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the spectral properties of quarks coupled with the soft modes at zero density were examined above but near the critical temperature of the second - order chiral transition in the chiral limit .",
    "it was found that a novel peak is formed around the zero energy as well as the normal and the antiplasmino ones , which then makes a three - peak structure in the quark spectral function : the formation of the far - low - lying peak is owed to the mixing between a quark ( antiquark ) and an antiquark hole ( quark hole ) by a resonant scattering of the quasiquarks with the soft modes with small but nonzero masses @xcite .",
    "such a formation of the three - peak structure in the spectral function of a fermion coupled with a bosonic excitation at @xmath11 is now confirmed beyond one loop @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a similar third peak in the ultrasoft region has been shown to exist in gauge theories at high temperature beyond the htl approximation on the basis of a novel resummation technique @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the neutrino spectrum shows similar three peaks containing an ultrasoft branch at electroweak scale temperature @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that such a three - peak structure in the fermion spectrum tends to be suppressed as the fermion mass becomes large @xcite .",
    "thus one might naturally suspect that the quark spectrum near the cp , which is realized when the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken , would not have any anomalous structure like that seen near the critical temperature in the chiral limit .",
    "however , a recent paper @xcite of the present authors shows that it may not be the case : in fact , the quark spectral function in this region can have an anomalously low - lying peak due to the coupling with the stable pionic modes with a nonhyperbolic dispersion relation around the pseudocritical temperature , which leads to a van hove singularity of the joint density of states in the imaginary part of the quark self energy .    in the present paper , we shall show that the quark spectrum around the cp shows yet another unexpected behavior due to the coupling to the phononlike soft mode in the spacelike region .",
    "the spectral properties of fermions at nonzero @xmath1 have been studied in gauge theories in the hard dense limit @xcite and also the electron spectrum in high density plasma @xcite .",
    "the modification of the quark spectrum near the cp is different from both of these cases , because the soft mode associated with the cp consists of particle - hole states in the spacelike region .",
    "it will also be shown that the effects of the van hove singularity present around the crossover region at @xmath12 almost die out around the cp .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",

    "we also note that although in a quite different context , shen and reddy @xcite calculated the neutrino scattering from hydrodynamic modes in hot and dense neutron matter using a transport equation . however , an extension of the model for such a complete description of the hydrodynamic modes and their couplings to the quark is beyond the scope of the present work .    in fig .",

    "behaviors of @xmath115 and @xmath120 for @xmath148 mev shown in the far - left panels are similar to those plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tp048ap ] , whereas clear peak structures in these functions , i.e. , the peaks in @xmath115 at @xmath154 mev and im@xmath120 at @xmath122 mev , observed near the cp are slightly obscured for this @xmath0 .",
    "this result shows that the soft mode associated with the cp can affect the quark spectrum even apart from the cp on the ridge of the chiral susceptibility . as @xmath0 is raised further , the effect of the soft mode gradually ceases to exist as shown in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3spc ] . in the lower middle panel",
    "one finds that the bump structure at @xmath155 mev almost disappears for @xmath156 mev .",
    "accordingly , the energy shift of the position of the quasiquark peak compared with the mfa value becomes smaller as shown in the upper middle panel .",
    "the lower right panel shows that the bump structure in im@xmath120 disappears almost completely for @xmath157 mev .    in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3spc ] , one finds that @xmath115 again forms a sharp peak at @xmath158 significantly smaller than the constituent quark mass @xmath7 , although the effect of the soft mode associated with the cp is suppressed . from the behavior of @xmath120 shown in the lower right panel",
    ", one finds that this modification comes from the singular behavior of @xmath120 around @xmath159 mev . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , these singularities are the van hove singularity in the scattering process of quarks and pionic modes induced by the nonhyperbolic dispersion relation of the pionic modes .",
    "this result shows that the effect of the pionic modes becomes more prominent as @xmath1 is lowered instead of the soft mode associated with the cp .    off the ridge of the chiral susceptibility ,",
    "the strength of the soft mode rapidly decreases as @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 are away from the cp .",
    "the strength of the peak in the quark spectrum originated from the scattering of the soft mode accordingly decreases rapidly .",
    "for example , when @xmath0 is raised from the cp with fixed @xmath160 , the distortion of the quark spectrum due to the soft mode is insignificant already at @xmath161 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the quark spectrum at nonzero temperature and density near the cp of the chiral transition in an effective model . the soft mode associated with the second - order transition at the cp is the scalar - density fluctuation in the spacelike region @xcite . in the present study , we have investigated the effect of this soft mode on the quark spectrum for the first time .",
    "we have shown that the soft mode strongly couples to a quark and an antiquark at vanishing momentum near the cp . as a result of this coupling , a quasiquark peak",
    "is created at the energy significantly lower than that in the mean - field approximation .",
    "it is also found that the strong modification of the quark spectrum due to the soft mode is observed over a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the ridge of the chiral susceptibility .",
    "the effect of the soft mode , however , is suppressed rapidly off the ridge . in our previous study @xcite , we found that the quark spectrum near the pseudocritical temperature at @xmath12 is strongly modified by the van hove singularity @xcite .",
    "although such a singularity is observed even for nonzero @xmath1 , the effect of the singularity is negligibly weak near the cp .    in the present study ,",
    "we have limited our attention to the quark spectral function at zero momentum , since the soft mode influences the quark spectrum at vanishing momentum most strongly . on the other hand ,",
    "excitation modes near the fermi momentum are relevant degrees of freedom in high density but low - temperature systems",
    ". the study of modes near the fermi surface is left as a future work . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] , a complete analysis of the quark spectrum near the cp will require us to incorporate all the hydrodynamic modes including the number - density fluctuation ( phonon ) and entropy fluctuations .",
    "the coupling to the density fluctuations may be taken into account by the inclusion of the vector interaction @xcite within this model .",
    "there are some attempts to incorporate the fermion - hydrodynamic modes coupling in the analysis of the phase structure and transport properties of the many body systems @xcite .",
    "we hope that we can report on such an analysis that extensively takes care of the coupling of the hydrodynamic modes to the quark near the cp elsewhere .",
