    "let @xmath17 , @xmath18 , be a connected domain with a compact lipschitz boundary  @xmath19 .. for @xmath2 , let @xmath3 denote the laplacian @xmath20 in @xmath4 with the robin boundary conditions @xmath21 at  @xmath19 , where @xmath7 stands for the outer unit normal .",
    "more precisely , @xmath22 is the self - adjoint operator in @xmath23 generated by the sesquilinear form @xmath24 here and below , @xmath25 denotes the @xmath26-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "one checks in the standard way that the operator @xmath3 is semibounded from below .",
    "if @xmath4 is bounded ( i.e. @xmath4 is an interior domain ) , then it has a compact resolvent , and we denote by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , its eigenvalues taken according to their multiplicities and enumerated in the non - decreasing order . if @xmath4 is unbounded ( i.e. @xmath4 is an exterior domain ) , then the essential spectrum of @xmath3 coincides with @xmath29 , and the discrete spectrum consists of finitely many eigenvalues which will be denoted again by @xmath10 , @xmath30 , and enumerated in the non - decreasing order taking into account the multiplicities .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of the eigenvalues @xmath10 for large @xmath31 .",
    "it seems that the problem was introduced by lacey , ockedon , sabina  @xcite when studying a reaction - diffusion system .",
    "giorgi and smits  @xcite studied a link to the theory of enhanced surface superconductivity .",
    "recently , freitas and krejik  @xcite and then pankrashkin and popoff  @xcite studied the eigenvalue asymptotics in the context of the spectral optimization .",
    "let us list some available results . under various assumptions",
    "one showed the asymptotics of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant depending on the geometric properties of  @xmath4 .",
    "lacey , ockedon , sabina  @xcite showed   with @xmath34 for @xmath35 compact domains , for which @xmath36 , and for triangles , for which @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the smallest corner .",
    "lu and zhu  @xcite showed   with @xmath34 and @xmath36 for compact @xmath39 smooth domains , and daners and kennedy  @xcite extended the result to any fixed @xmath28 .",
    "levitin and parnovski  @xcite showed with @xmath34 for domains with piecewise smooth compact lipschitz boundaries .",
    "they proved , in particular , that if @xmath4 is a curvilinear polygon whose smallest corner is  @xmath38 , then for @xmath40 there holds @xmath37 , otherwise @xmath36 .",
    "pankrashkin  @xcite considered two - dimensional domains with a piecewise @xmath35 smooth compact boundary and without convex corners , and it was shown that @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the maximum of the signed curvature at the boundary .",
    "exner , minakov , parnovski  @xcite showed that for compact @xmath35 smooth domains the same asymptotics @xmath43 holds for any fixed @xmath28 .",
    "similar results were obtained by exner and minakov  @xcite for a class of two - dimensional domains with non - compact boundaries and by pankrashkin and popoff  @xcite for @xmath44 compact domains in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "cakoni , chaulet , haddar  @xcite studied the asymptotic behavior of higher eigenvalues .",
    "the computation of further terms in the eigenvalue asymptotics needs more precise geometric assumptions . to our knowledge ,",
    "such results are available for the two - dimensional case only .",
    "helffer and pankrashkin  @xcite studied the tunneling effect for the eigenvalues of a specific domain with two equal corners , and helffer and kachmar  @xcite considered the domains whose boundary curvature has a unique non - degenerate maximum .",
    "the machinery of the both papers is based on the asymptotic properties of the eigenfunctions : it was shown that the eigenfunctions corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues concentrate near the smallest convex corner at the boundary or , if no convex corners are present , near the point of the maximum curvature , and this is used to obtain the corresponding eigenvalue asymptotics .    the aim of the present note is to consider a new class of two - dimensional domains  @xmath4 .",
    "namely , our assumption is as follows : @xmath45 such domains are not covered by the above cited works : all the corners are non - convex , and the curvature is constant on the smooth part of the boundary , and it is not clear how the eigenfunctions are concentrated along the boundary . we hope that our result will be of use for the understanding of the role of  non - convex corners .    in order to formulate the main result we need some notation .",
    "denote the vertices of the polygon @xmath46 by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and assume that they are enumerated is such a way that the boundary @xmath19 is the union of the @xmath49 line segments @xmath50 $ ] , @xmath51 , where we denote @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "it is also assumed that there are no artificial vertices , i.e. that @xmath54 $ ] for any @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath56 the length of the side @xmath57 , and by @xmath14 the dirichlet laplacian @xmath58 on @xmath16 viewed as a self - adjoint operator in @xmath59 .",
    "the main result of the present note is as follows :    [ thm1 ] for any fixed @xmath8 there holds @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath9th eigenvalue of the operator @xmath13 .    the proof is based on the machinery proposed by exner and post  @xcite to study the convergence on graph - like manifolds .",
    "actually our construction appears to be quite similar to that of post  @xcite used to study decoupled waveguides .",
    "we remark that due to the presence of non - convex corners the domain of the operator @xmath3 contains singular functions and is not included in  @xmath62 , see e.g. grisvard  @xcite .",
    "this does not produce any difficulties as our approach is purely variational and is entirely based on the analysis of the sesqulinear form .",
    "for @xmath2 , denote by @xmath63 the following self - adjoint operator in @xmath64 : @xmath65 it is well known that @xmath66 the sesqulinear form @xmath67 for the operator @xmath63 looks as follows : @xmath68    [ lem2 ] for any @xmath69 there holds @xmath70    denote by @xmath71 the orthogonal projector on @xmath72 in @xmath64 , then by the spectral theorem we have @xmath73 for any @xmath74 . as",
    "@xmath75 is normalized , there holds @xmath76 and we arrive at the conclusion .",
    "another important estimate is as follows , see lemmas  2.6 and  2.8 in  @xcite :    [ lem - lp ] let @xmath77 be an infinite sector of opening @xmath78 , then for any @xmath79 and any function @xmath80 there holds @xmath81 \\,1 , & \\theta\\in [ \\pi,2\\pi ) .",
