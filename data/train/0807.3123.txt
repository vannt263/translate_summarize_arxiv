    "although @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s have been studied extensively since their discoveries , their prompt production mechanism is still not well understood . for reviews on quarkonium production the reader is referred to refs  @xcite .",
    "below we only summarise some relevant aspects .",
    "initially , prompt production of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s was assumed to take place via the leading order _ colour singlet model _ ( csm ) .",
    "however , in 1997 , cdf studies showed large excesses in the amount of prompt quarkonia produced with respect to theory predictions  @xcite , and new production mechanisms were invented . among the most popular approaches",
    "is non - relativistic qcd , where production at parton level can also take place via a colour octet quark pair . while this _ colour octet mechanism _ ( com ) is quite successful in explaining the transverse momentum spectra of quarkonia , the polarisation predictions of the com mechanism are in sheer disagreement with experimental data : production via a colour - octet state predicts a significant transverse polarisation of @xmath0  s and @xmath1 s , while recent tevatron data contradict this prediction  @xcite .",
    "the csm in its own has been revived recently , when it has been shown that nlo and nnlo qcd contributions  @xcite as well as @xmath2-channel cut contributions  @xcite arising from relativistic corrections could lead to an enhancement of the production cross section of the csm , while predicting a polarisation closer to the data .",
    "given the puzzling situation , it is the utmost importance to study prompt quarkonia at the lhc , where they can be studied with vast statistics up to high transverse momentum .",
    "standard measurements are generally related to kinematical distributions of the quarkonium decay products , such as differential cross section and polarization measurements , and focus on decays into muons .",
    "although these provide useful information , they may be sensitive to other factors .",
    "hence it is important to investigate additional observables . in particular",
    ", we should take into account not only the kinematics of the quarkonium itself , but also that of particles produced in association .",
    "in fact , in some cases prompt quarkonia can be searched for in association with a heavy quark pair  @xcite .",
    "also , for an unambiguous understanding of quarkonium production , direct production should be studied , for example @xmath3 production could be studied by radiative decays into @xmath0 s .    in this note",
    "we discuss general aspects of prompt @xmath0  and @xmath1(1s ) production at the lhc . also , we show examples of observables that are sensitive to the hadronic activity directly around the quarkonium , thereby allowing to extract information about the radiation emitted off the coloured heavy quark pair during production .",
    "the results apply only to a general purpose lhc detector , and for this work we took the cms parameters  @xcite as reference .",
    "we do not distinguish here between direct and indirect ( via radiative @xmath3 decay ) prompt @xmath0-production .",
    "the outline of this note is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss event generation of @xmath0  and @xmath1(1s ) in pythia . in section 3",
    "we discuss the production of @xmath0 s at the lhc , and study the differences in radiation between different production toy models .",
    "we will also study the @xmath0-reconstruction efficiency . in section 4",
    "we concentrate on @xmath1 s .",
    "section 5 contains conclusions .",
    "we have produced @xmath0-events using pythia 6.409  @xcite .",
    "the implementation  @xcite is based on the nqrcd approach and quarkonium production via the singlet ( lo ) and octet mechanism .",
    "the octet @xmath4-states have a mass of 3.1 gev .",
    "the values of the nrqcd matrix elements are taken from ref .",
    "we have modified the default branching ratios for the radiative decays of the @xmath5-states into @xmath0 s to correspond to the recent pdg values  @xcite .",
    "the polarisation has been set to zero .",
    "production via @xmath5 states is included . in this study we forced the @xmath0  and @xmath1",
    "to always decay into @xmath6 , the branching ratios are 5.93% and 2.48% respectively  @xcite .",
    "the following features are included .",
    "we have made use of an event reweighting function , allowing the quarkonia cross section to be dampened at small @xmath7 values , in analogy to the underlying event formalism in pythia  @xcite .",
    "the events obtain a weight @xmath8 according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the transverse momentum evaluated in the rest frame of the scattering , @xmath11 the momentum transfer scale , and @xmath12 the regularisation scale , used also in the underlying event cross section regularisation . as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : wi ] , at small @xmath13a suppression is obtained while at large @xmath13the cross section is unmodified .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is be extrapolated from the @xmath15 value determined at 1960 gev to the lhc energy : @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ xs ] ( left ) we demonstrate the regularisation procedure , as well as the difference between the old pythia ( before version 6.324 ) and the new production model .",
    "below we discuss @xmath0-production , however it applies to @xmath1 s too .",
    "if the @xmath0  is produced via the singlet model , the @xmath4  does not radiate and the charmonium is thus produced in isolation ( when produced at lo ) , up to normal underlying event activity . when it is produced via the octet mechanism , the situation is not apriori clear , but it is reasonable to assume that a shower can evolve and that the charmonium is embedded in a certain amount of shower activity .",
    "this results from 1 ) repeated @xmath17 branchings before the branching @xmath18 , and 2 ) from the radiation off the colour octet @xmath4-state once formed .",
    "there are several switches to regulate the hadronic activity . using these",
    ", we generate @xmath0 s in four different production mechanisms , each with varying amount of radiation .",
    "* production via _ singlet _ only .",
    "the @xmath0 s are produced in isolation . in the hard process",
    "a number of hard gluons is emitted for colour neutralization , but these are recoiling against the @xmath0  and thus expected to be back - to - back to the @xmath0 . * octet production only , where the octet @xmath19 undergoes only a small amount of parton shower evolution only . here",
    "mstp(148)=0 , implying that the splitting kernel used for the branching @xmath20 is the @xmath21 kernel , modified for the @xmath4-mass . only a small amount of activity if expected to be emitted during the parton cascade , yet the activity is expected to be much larger than in the colour singlet case . this case is referred to as _ octet low radiation _ scenario .",
    "* octet production only , but mstp(148)=1 and mstp(149)=0 .",
    "now the splitting kernel for @xmath20 is the @xmath17 one , again modified for the @xmath4-mass . in each branching",
    "the @xmath4-state is likely to get the largest energy : @xmath22 .",
    "the amount of radiation is larger than in the previous case , however because of the suppression of @xmath23 only a small amount of hard gluons is expected around the @xmath0 .",
    "this case is referred to as _ octet medium radiation_. * octet production only , but now mstp(148)=1 and mstp(149)=1 . again the @xmath17 splitting kernel is used , but now @xmath22 and @xmath23 have equal probability ( in reality @xmath22 still dominates due to mass effects ) . here a significant amount of hard gluons can be emitted before the hadronisation process , in fact showering activity might be overestimated .",
    "we will refer to this case as _ octet high radiation _ scenario .",
    "it must be emphasised that these models are straw - man models , and that we do not expect any of them to reproduce the data by itself .",
    "finally , note that cdf data can be reproduced by adding singlet and octet contributions , but that any of the 3 octet models together with the singlet model fit the data .",
    "for the production of prompt @xmath0@xmath24-events we have generated events in 5 bins of @xmath10 , the transverse momentum exchanged in the hard process ( 0 - 10 , 10 - 20 , 20 - 30 , 30 - 50 , 50-@xmath25 gev ) .",
    "this was done in view of the large production cross section at low @xmath13 , in order to have statistics also at large @xmath13 . in total 2 m events in four different production scenarios ( see sec .  [ pytshower ] ) have been generated .",
    "the luminosity of the lowest @xmath26-bin for the singlet model corresponds to only 0.2 pb@xmath27,while the higher @xmath26bins correspond to higher luminosities .",
    "we applied a filter at generator level requiring two muons with @xmath28 and @xmath29 gev/@xmath30 .",
    "as background for the @xmath0-production studies we have considered non - prompt @xmath0-events",
    ". an inclusive non - prompt @xmath0  sample has been generated ( pythia setting msel=1 , cross section 55 mb ) , and passed through a dimuon generator level filter ( @xmath28 and @xmath31 gev/@xmath30 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the sample we use is 4.45 pb@xmath27 , corresponding to roughly 400000 filtered non - prompt j / psi - events .",
    "prompt @xmath1 s have been generated in the four different production scenarios of sec .",
    "[ pytshower ] , corresponding to 100 pb@xmath27 , without @xmath26-bins . here",
    "a dimuon filter was used requiring the muons to have @xmath28 and @xmath32 gev/@xmath30 . since",
    "the @xmath1-production cross section is smaller than that of @xmath0 s , we will need more lhc data , possibly including pile - up .",
    "we included here 5 pile - up events per @xmath1-event .",
    "as background for the @xmath1-production studies we have used an inclusive @xmath33 sample generated again with msel=1 in pythia , corresponding to 0.14 pb@xmath27 .",
    "all events are processed through a toy - detector based on the expected performances of the cms detector  @xcite .",
    "we have not included trigger requirements , but being interested in high values of the transverse momentum of the quarkonium ( see sec 4 ) , we expect no problems in triggering .",
    "typically , a double muon with some threshold would be used , for example 3 gev for each muon  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ xs ] ( right ) the differential cross section for a cms - like detector as function of @xmath13  is shown for the four production cases . to obtain the total cross section the singlet curve",
    "should be added with one of the three octet curves .",
    "the singlet curve decreases rapidly with @xmath13 , as expected . for the octet cases ,",
    "the decrease is faster for models with more radiation , since here the @xmath4  loses more energy in radiating .",
    "although the curves are well separated at high transverse momentum , these curves are influenced by different factors , such as initial and final state radiation , the mass of the cc - octet , and parameters entering in the cross section dampening  @xcite . in conclusion , it is important to find complementary observables .    to have a rough idea of the statistics expected at cms , we display in tab .  [",
    "tab : numbers ] the numbers of @xmath0 s produced within acceptance in ranges of @xmath13  in 100 pb@xmath27 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      just like @xmath0 s a general purpose detector could detect @xmath1 s by detecting the muons . the reconstruction efficiency with respect to the filtered events as a function of @xmath34  if displayed in fig .",
    "[ zyeff ] ( right ) . as opposed to @xmath0 s , @xmath1 s",
    "can be reconstructed down to zero transverse momentum . indeed , even when @xmath34@xmath35 , the momentum of the then back - to - back muons is sufficiency large to be detected , because of the high @xmath1-mass ( 9.46 gev ) .",
    "furthermore , the value of the reconstruction efficiency where it plateaus is seen to be larger for @xmath1 s than for @xmath0 s .",
    "this is due to the fact that the muons from @xmath36 have a larger separation angle than those of @xmath37 , so are better detectable .      in fig.[upsact ]",
    "( left ) we display the variable @xmath38 at reconstruction level . in fig.[upsact ] ( right ) the transverse momentum density d@xmath7/d@xmath39 is shown for @xmath1 s between 20 and 40 gev for the four @xmath1  production models , in a cone @xmath40 around the @xmath1 , at reconstruction level .",
    "although the amount of hadronic activity is smaller than for @xmath0 s , the differences are still well visible . to obtain these results ,",
    "first the tracks coming from pile - up have been subtracted .",
    "the main background is from qcd events , where we have b - quarks decaying into muons .",
    "the spectrum is well - known . due to the weak b - decay ,",
    "the hadronic activity around these reconstructed muon - pairs is high .",
    "unfortunately , studying this background with the current monte carlo samples is difficult .",
    "the efficiency for a @xmath33 background event to end up both close to the @xmath1-mass and at high @xmath34 , is very tiny . to study the background with sufficient statistics , a more dedicated monte carlo generation should be done . in real data , however ,",
    "we expect studying background not to be a limiting factor to this analysis , because it can be studied accurately in the sidebands left and right of the @xmath1-mass window . having no other background components , most probably it can simply be subtracted to obtain the hadronic activity of pure @xmath1 s .",
    "up to today the prompt quarkonium production mechanism is not understood .",
    "lhc will open up new possibilities for studying quarkonium production . apart from cross section and polarisation measurements , it is important to study different observables .",
    "an example is shown here , and suggests studying observables sensitive to hadronic activity produced in association with prompt quarkonia .",
