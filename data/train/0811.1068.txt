    "since the launch of the _ swift _ satellite in 2004 , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) aboard has revealed several new features of early x - ray afterglow light curves of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. , mzros 2006 ; zhang 2007 for reviews ) : ( i ) the transition from prompt phase to afterglow phase usually exhibits steep decline of x - ray flux , which is generally interpreted as the high - latitude tail of prompt emission ( i.e. , curvature effect ; fenimore et al . 1996 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; ) , ( ii ) a shallow decay usually follows the steep segment during the first hours , which could be caused by a spread of lorentz factors in grb ejecta ( rees & mezros 1998 ) or a continuous energy injection into grb ejeta due to lasting activities of grb central engines ( e.g. , dai & lu 1998a , 1998b ; zhang & mszros 2001a ; dai 2004 ; fan & xu 2006 ; yu & dai 2007 ) , and ( iii ) bright x - ray flares superimposing on underlying afterglow emission were observed from nearly a half of the _ swift _ grbs ( burrows et al . 2005 ; see chincarini et al .",
    "2007 and falcone et al .",
    "2007 for more recent statistic studies ) .",
    "these discoveries are of great importance for revealing the nature of grb central engines , and especially , x - ray flares are widely accepted to be due to some delayed intermittent activities of the central engines .    in the sight of model",
    ", the delayed intermittent activities might be episodic accretion onto a central object due to a chopped accretion disk ( perna et al .",
    "2006 ) , or episodic accretion due to a modulation of the accretion flow by a magnetic barrier ( proga & zhang 2006 ) , or magnetic reconnection on a nascent differentially - rotating massive neutron star ( dai et al . 2006 ) , etc .",
    "many scenarios were designed in the past few years , but none of them is conclusive ( see zhang 2007 for a review ) . however , the key point is that , in almost all of these scenarios , internal dissipations in late - ejected materials are usually required to produce flare emission .",
    "the leading mechanism for internal dissipation is late internal shocks ( liss ; burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; fan & wei 2005 ) , which are generated by collisions among some shells ejected at different times with different lorentz factors and energies .",
    "hitherto , the properties of lis - produced emission have been discussed for a few times ( e.g. , fan & wei 2005 ; wu et al .",
    "2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; zou et al .",
    "2006 ; fan et al .",
    "2007 ; galli & guetta 2008 ) .",
    "however , the properties of the pre - collision shells , which are directly determined by the late activities of the central engines , were not concerned in their works . in this paper , in contrast , we give a more detailed description for the dynamics of liss including internal forward and reverse shocks , and then investigate the predicted x - ray flare luminosity and the shape of light curves within a wide model parameter space . by confronting the theoretical predictions with some observational features of x - ray flares",
    ", we can find some constraints on the model parameters .",
    "furthermore , it must be helpful to constrain the model more stringently by performing a simultaneous observation in the high - energy @xmath1-ray bands for x - ray flares in the _ fermi _ era .",
    "as suggested previously by wang , li , & mszros ( 2006 ) , fan & piran ( 2006 ) , and galli & guetta ( 2008 ) , high energy flares are expected to arise from inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of low - energy flare photons off some relativistic electrons .",
    "these electrons belong to either grb ejecta ( i.e. external inverse compton , eic ) or flare ejecta self ( i.e. synchrotron self - compton , ssc ) . based on the same consideration ,",
    "we discuss the detectability of high energy flares in the _ fermi _ era with the careful description for lis dynamics along with the constraints from x - ray observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the dynamics of a pair of shocks arising from a collision between two homogeneous shells and the resulting synchrotron radiation of the shocked electrons . in section 3",
    ", the model is tested by some observational features of x - ray flares .",
    "in section 4 , we estimate the accompanying ssc high - energy emission and its detectability in the _ fermi _ era .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section 5 .",
    "after the prompt phase of a grb , the central engine might still be able to eject some separate shells with different lorentz factors and energies due to its delayed intermittent activities .",
    "collisions between these shells generate liss , which give rise to the observed x - ray flares . for simplicity , the scope of the paper is restricted within one collision between two homogeneous shells .",
    "we set the time zero point at the grb trigger and measure time in the observer s frame . at a time of @xmath2 ,",
    "the central engine ejects a shell denoted by @xmath3 , which moves at a constant bulk lorentz factor @xmath4 and carries an isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy luminosity @xmath5 .",
    "the particle number density of the shell measured in its comoving frame ( denoted by a prime hereafter ) can be calculated by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius of the shell . some time ( @xmath8 ) later",
    ", another shell denoted by @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is assumed to be ejected again .",
    "we require @xmath12 in order to let shell @xmath9 catch up and collide with the prior shell @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , a collision between @xmath3 and @xmath9 takes place at the radius @xmath13 and the time @xmath14 . for @xmath15",
    ", they read @xmath16 @xmath17 the collision time @xmath18 determines the observed onset time @xmath19 of a flare in physics .",
    "strictly , @xmath19 should be mildly larger than @xmath18 since the physical onset is usually buried by normal afterglow emission .    due to the collision ,",
    "a pair of shocks are generated , including a forward shock and a reverse shock that propagate into shells @xmath3 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "separated by the two shocks and a contact discontinuity surface , the system is divided into four regions : ( 1 ) unshocked shell @xmath3 , ( 2 ) shocked shell @xmath3 , ( 3 ) shocked shell @xmath9 , and ( 4 ) unshocked shell @xmath9 , bulk lorentz factors of which are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "considering the motion of the shocked regions relative to unshocked regions 1 and 4 , respectively , two relative lorentz factors can be calculated by @xmath23 then , according to the jump conditions between the two sides of a shock ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , we can calculate the internal energy densities of the two shocked regions by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium between the two shocked regions requires @xmath28 , which yields @xmath29 for four given parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , that describe the basic properties of the pre - collision shells , we can obtain the value of @xmath1 by solving equations ( [ relgam ] ) and ( [ dyne ] ) .",
    "in particular , for four limits shown in the ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) parameter space ( see figure 1 ) , these equations can be solved analytically .",
    "for @xmath34 , we have ( i ) if @xmath35 , @xmath36 which means the forward shock is relativistic and the reverse shock is newtonian ( rfs & nrs ) ; ( ii ) if @xmath37 , @xmath38 which means both the forward and reverse shocks are relativistic ( rfs & rrs ) ; ( iii ) if @xmath39 , @xmath40 which means the forward shock is newtonian whereas the reverse shock is relativistic ( nfs & rrs ) . finally , ( iv ) for @xmath41 , both the forward and reverse shocks are newtonian ( nfs & nrs ) .",
    "since @xmath42 , @xmath31 , and the ratio @xmath43 are unchanged with the moving of the shells , the values of @xmath1 as well as @xmath44 and @xmath45 can keep constant before the shocks cross the shells . in principle , when one shock crosses the corresponding shell , the other shock should be decelerated in the rest frame of its upstream material . however ,",
    "if the energy carried by the remaining unshocked material is much less than the energy of the total shocked material at that time , @xmath1 would be not changed significantly .",
    "so , we can treat with @xmath1 as a constant always approximately if we assume the crossing times of the two shocks to be equal more or less . after both shocks vanish , the merged shell no longer interacts with any other materials until it is caught up with by the third late - ejected shell .",
    "the above analysis on kinematics and dynamics yields the evolution of the radius of the system after the collision , @xmath46 where we redefine the time @xmath47 by resetting the time zero point from the grb trigger to the flare onset time .",
    "we can define an initial expansion time from equation ( [ rt ] ) , @xmath48 and find that the increase of the radius before @xmath49 can be ignored ( i.e. @xmath50 ) but after @xmath49 the radius increases linearly with time ( i.e. @xmath51 ) .",
    "moreover , as the propagation of the shocks , the total electron numbers can be calculated by @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the two shocked regions ( dai & lu 2002 ) , both of which are proportional to @xmath47 before the shock crossing .",
    "for the two shocked regions , fractions @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the internal energy are assumed to be carried by magnetic fields and hot electrons , respectively .",
    "then , the strength of the magnetic fields reads @xmath56 , whose variation is determined by the evolution of @xmath57 . denoting the comoving volume of a shocked region as @xmath58",
    ", we adopt @xmath59 by ignoring a possible spreading of the hot shocked materials . in the presence of the shocks that might be able to suppress the spreading of the hot materials , the neglect of the spreading may be plausible .",
    "however , after the shock crossing time @xmath60 ( we assume here the two shocks cross at a similar time ) , the spreading of the hot materials into the vacuum can not be ignored and the hot materials should experience an adiabatic cooling . during this phase ,",
    "we assume that the volume of the merged shell is determined by a simple power - law as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a free parameter and its value is taken from 2 to 3 .",
    "then , the particle number densities would decrease as @xmath63 and the internal energy densities as @xmath64 due to adiabatic cooling .",
    "therefore , a multi - power temporal behavior for the magnetic field strength can be found : @xmath65 @xmath66    as usual , we assume that electrons are accelerated by the shocks to distribute as @xmath67 for @xmath68 , where the minimum lorentz factor is defined as @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 or @xmath45 . additionally , the cooling lorentz factor , @xmath72 $ ] , also needs to be introduced , above which the electrons lose most of their enegies .",
    "the compton parameter @xmath73 defined as the ratio of the ic to synchrotron luminosities can be estimated by @xmath74/2 $ ] with @xmath75 $ ] ( sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "then , by calculating two characteristic frequencies and a peak flux density , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the luminosity distance of the source , a multi - power synchrotron spectrum contributed by a shock can be written as ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .    to obtain x - ray light curves further",
    ", the temporal dependence of the characteristic quantities also needs to be presented as follows :    \\(i ) in the case of @xmath85 , @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88    \\(ii ) in the case of @xmath89 , @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 from the above expressions , we can see that @xmath93 reaches its minimum value at @xmath49 , while @xmath94 starts to decrease at the same time .",
    "so , the relationships between @xmath93 and @xmath94 as well as the spectra and light curves can be found easily by fixing and comparing the values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 at @xmath49 .",
    "observations have shown that x - ray flares may consist of one or a few pulses .",
    "we consider one pulse to be mainly produced by one collision between two shells . here",
    "we do not try to fit x - ray observational data in detail , which requires a more elaborate model that takes the fine structure of pre - collision shells into account . instead , we only test the model by some fundamental observational features of x - ray flares .",
    "statistic studies found that the average flare fluence ( in @xmath95 kev band ) is approximately a factor of ten less than the fluence of prompt emission as @xmath96 ( falcone et al .",
    "2007 ) and the flare peak times @xmath97 concentrate into the range from 100 to 1000 s ( chincarini et al . 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , according to @xmath98 , the temporal width of flares , @xmath99 , can be estimated to be from a few to several ten seconds . by considering the spread of the distributions of these quantities",
    ", we suggest to take @xmath100 as the lower limit for the peak flux of x - ray flares . for a typical luminosity distance @xmath101 cm for grbs ,",
    "we give @xmath102 as the lower limit for x - ray flare luminosity .    in order to derive some constraints on the model from this luminosity lower limit",
    ", first we show two ( @xmath103 ) parameter spaces in figure 2 with certain values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 : @xmath106 for the left panel and @xmath107 for the right panel , which correspond to different dynamic cases .",
    "according to the variation of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , .",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 from the spectrum due to the shock that dominates the x - ray emission and thus the subscription @xmath110 of the quantities is omitted in this section . ]",
    "the parameter spaces can be roughly divided into four regions denoted by ` a , b , c , d ' , where different relationships among @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath111 are given as listed in table 1 .",
    "we then use some shaded contours to show the regions where model - predicted x - ray luminosity exceeds the observational lower limit .",
    "obviously , region ` a ' is restricted significantly by this luminosity constraint due to the slow cooling of electrons ( as indicated by @xmath112 ) that leads to a low radiation efficiency . to be more specific",
    ", we can conclude further that ( i ) in order to produce sufficiently strong flare emission , it is required that @xmath113 .",
    "this means that at least one of the forward and reverse shocks is mild - relativistic ; and ( ii ) when @xmath114 , we can obtain the highest theoretical x - ray luminosity , because this parameter region roughly locates the boundary between regions ` c ' and ` d ' , where the relationship @xmath115 can be found , indicating a high x - ray radiation efficiency .",
    "second , in order to uncover the dependence of the emission on parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we also show two corresponding parameter spaces in figure 3 with certain values of @xmath42 and @xmath31",
    ". a minimum value of @xmath116 for @xmath105 can be found , but the constraint on @xmath104 is loose .",
    "this indicates that the resulting x - ray luminosity is mainly determined by the kinetic - energy luminosity of the lagged rapid shell rather than that of the leading slow shell .",
    "finally , in the above calculations for x - ray luminosity , we ignored possible synchrotron self - absorption of the x - ray photons , which is able to suppress the x - ray emission .",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption thickness at the x - ray band can be calculated by ( panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) @xmath117 where @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath81 for @xmath121 and @xmath83 for @xmath122 . by scanning the whole parameter spaces shown in figures 2 and 3 , we find that the values of @xmath123 are always much lower than unity due to the large internal shock radius , which means the synchrotron self - absorption of the x - ray photons",
    "can be ignored safely .",
    "we here test the model by considering the shape of the observed x - ray flare light curves , a basic feature of which is the rapid rise and fall . following the frequency relationships given in table 1 , we can find three possible types of the theoretical x - ray light curves , as shown schematically by the black lines in figure 4 for @xmath124 where the time zero is set at the flare onset time .",
    "the light curves break at several characteristic times and the corresponding temporal indices ( @xmath125 ) are listed in table 1 .",
    "all of the segments after @xmath60 are steepened significantly by the shock crossing effect . by confronting these theoretical light curves with the observed ones , on one hand",
    ", it is easy to understand the observed steep rise by resetting the time zero point of the log - log figure from the flare onset time to the grb trigger . on the other hand , as discovered by liang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the rapid decline of most x - ray flares seems to be consistent with the curvature effect that predicts a temporal index being equal to the simultaneous spectral index plus 2 . as shown by the black lines in figure 4 ,",
    "the intrinsic decline slope of the last segment is @xmath126 for all types of the theoretical light curves and the corresponding spectral index is @xmath127 due to @xmath128 . for @xmath129 and @xmath130 ,",
    "the inequation @xmath131 can be satisfied easily .",
    "this inequation indicates that , in any case in our model , the observed x - ray flux decay should be dominated by the curvature effect , as shown by the grey lines in figure 4 .",
    "in addition , although some relatively flat segments with @xmath132 or @xmath133 appear in types ii and iii light curves , we still can not rule out any one of them absolutely , because these segments that could not be very far from the flare onset time may be steepened by the time zero effect dramatically .",
    "because a part of the synchrotron photons would be boosted to higher energy by their ic scattering off some relativistic electrons , high energy counterparts of x - ray flares are expected naturally . in the following calculations ,",
    "we restrict our attention within the lis model and ssc scenario . before a specific calculation for the ssc emission",
    ", we first estimate the flux sensitivity of the lat aboard the _ fermi _ by @xmath134 following zhang & mszros ( 2001b ) who adopted the criterion that at least five photons are collected if the instrument is source dominated , where @xmath135 is the photon energy and @xmath136 is the integration time . the effective area @xmath137 of the instrument is taken as a constant of @xmath138 and the dependence of the area on the photon energy",
    "is neglected .",
    "however , after a transition time of @xmath139s ( gou & mszros 2007 ; yu et al .",
    "2007 ) , the sensitivity should start to scale as @xmath140 due to a limitation by the background for a long - time observation .",
    "following sari & esin ( 2001 ) , the ssc spectrum contributed by a shock can be obtained by shifting the seed synchrotron spectrum to higher energy range , i.e. estimating the two break frequencies and the peak flux density of the ssc spectrum respectively by @xmath141 this approximative treatment is finely valid when the effect of the klein - nishina suppression is unimportant .",
    "considering the highest - energy electrons whose energy enter the klein - nishina regime , we refer to the third break in the ssc spectrum , @xmath142 above which the ssc spectrum follows @xmath143 ( gupta & zhang 2007 ; fragile et al .",
    "therefore , the approximative ssc spectrum can be summarized as follows ( gupta & zhang 2007 ) @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath81 for @xmath147 and @xmath83 for @xmath148 .",
    "using equation ( [ sscspe ] ) , we calculate the peak flux of gev @xmath1-ray flares as shown by the shaded contours in figure 5 . comparing these gev emission contours with the dashed contours that correspond to the x - ray luminosity",
    ", a positive correlation between these two emission components can be found .",
    "for the grbs at a typical distance of @xmath149 cm , the high energy counterparts of the relatively brighter x - ray flares could be detected by the lat , whereas those associated with weaker x - ray flares leak .",
    "the lat sensitivity here ( @xmath150 ) is calculated for a typical flare onset time of several hundred seconds and represented by the dash - dotted line in the figure .",
    "furthermore , according to the expression of @xmath74/2 $ ] , we know that the relative importance of the ssc and synchrotron emissions may be sensitive to the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath151 . therefore , we show the gev @xmath1-ray flux at the time of @xmath152 varying in the ( @xmath55 , @xmath153 ) parameter space in figure 6 .",
    "it can be seen that the high energy flux is mainly sensitive to @xmath151 and equipartition values for @xmath151 are required .",
    "in addition , we would like to show some example spectra numerically in figure 7 using a more elaborate code that was developed in yu et al .",
    "the lis model is usually employed to explain the observed grb afterglow x - ray flares . however , a careful description for lis dynamics and some observational constraints on it still need to be investigated . based on this consideration ,",
    "we studied the properties of lis - produced emission in the framework of a simplified paradigm , i.e. internal forward - reverse shocks generated by a collision between two homogeneous shells . with a lower limit for the observed x - ray luminosity , we found a mildly high ratio of the lorentz factors of pre - collision shells , which leads to at least one mildly - relativistic internal shock .",
    "our results also show that the brightest x - ray flares might imply a high variability of lorentz factors as indicated by @xmath154 .",
    "the luminosity of the x - ray flares is mainly determined by the kinetic energy luminosity of the delayed rapid shell rather than the leading slow shell .",
    "after an investigation of the characteristic frequencies in a wide parameter space , three types of theoretical x - ray light curves are found , all of which are ended by a very steep decay with @xmath155 .",
    "this indicates that the flare emission during the decay phase is probably dominated by the curvature effect , which is consistent with the observational inference found by liang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we also investigated the peak flux of the gev @xmath1-ray counterparts in the ssc scenario . by comparing the gev flux with the flux sensitivity of the _ fermi _ lat",
    ", we found that the high energy flares associated with relatively brighter x - ray flares could be detected by the lat for a distance of @xmath149 cm to the source , where an equipartition value of @xmath55 is required .",
    "this possible detection will be very helpful to discriminate different origins of high energy flares and different models for x - ray flares . as mentioned above ,",
    "two types of high energy flares are predicted by the lis model including the ones due to the ssc and eic emission . in the ssc case , a good temporal correlation between the x - ray and high energy flares are expected , whereas a significant temporal extension appears for high energy flares in the eic case ( fan et al .",
    "in addition , besides the lis model , some authors suggested that x - ray flares may be produced by a delayed external shock and the corresponding high energy emission was also expected ( galli & piro 2007 ) .",
    "but for the delayed afterglow model it is difficult to explain the reoccurrence of x - ray flares in one grb afterglow .",

    "<S> we study afterglow flares of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in the framework of the late internal shock ( lis ) model based on a careful description for the dynamics of a pair of shocks generated by a collision between two homogeneous shells , . </S>",
    "<S> first , by confronting the model with some fundamental observational features of x - ray flares , we find some constraints on the properties of the pre - collision shells that are directly determined by the central engine of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> second , high energy emission associated with x - ray flares , which arises from synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission of liss , is investigated in a wide parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted flux of high energy flares may reach as high as @xmath0 , which is likely to be detectable with the large area telescope ( lat ) aboard _ the fermi space telescope _ ( formerly glast ) . </S>"
