    "<S> the enigmatic pseudogap phase in underdoped cuprate high @xmath0 superconductors has long been recognized as a central puzzle of the @xmath0 problem . </S>",

    "<S> however , the origin of the ordering wavevector and the mechanism of the charge order is unknown . at the same time , earlier data show that precursive superconducting fluctuations are also associated with this phase . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the pseudogap phase is a novel pairing state where electrons on the same side of the fermi surface are paired , in strong contrast with conventional bcs theory which pair electrons on opposite sides of the fermi surface . in this state </S>",
    "<S> the cooper pair carries a net momentum and belong to a general class called pair density wave ( pdw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic pairing mechanism comes from a gauge theory formulation of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) picture , where spinons traveling in the same direction feel an attractive force in analogy with ampere s effects in electromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we call this amperean pairing </S>",
    "<S> . charge order automatically appears as a subsidiary order parameter even when long range pair order is destroyed by phase fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> our theory gives a prediction of the ordering wavevector which is in good agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the quasiparticle spectrum from our model explains many of the unusual features reported in photoemission experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi arc , the unusual way the tip of the arc terminates and the relation of the spanning vector of the arc tips to the charge ordering wavevector also come out naturally . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how the onset of the kerr effect in this state can be accommodated . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose an experiment which can directly test the notion of amperean pairing .    since the early days of cuprate superconductivity research , the pseudogap phase has been identified as a central piece of the high t@xmath1 puzzle.@xcite the pseudogap opens below a temperature @xmath2 much above t@xmath1 in underdoped cuprates , and is visible in the spin susceptibility as detected by the knight shift , in tunneling spectroscopy and in _ c_-axis conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) shows that the pseudogap opens in the anti - nodal region near @xmath3 , ( we set the lattice constant @xmath4 to unity ) , leaving behind ungapped `` fermi arcs '' centered around the nodes . </S>",
    "<S> recent x - ray scattering data @xcite reveal that the pseudogap is likely to be a distinct phase , characterized by the onset of a charge density wave ( cdw ) with wavevectors at @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 _ decreases _ with increasing doping , thus confirming evidence for charge order found earlier by stm @xcite and nmr experiments . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite recent advances include stm and x - ray studies on the same bi-2212 samples . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite other signatures include kerr rotation,@xcite the emergence of anisotropy in the nernst effect , etc.@xcite ( another set of experiments found the onset of intra unit cell magnetization ( loop currents ) at a somewhat higher temperature.@xcite we shall not address this phenomenon in this paper . )    </S>",
    "<S> the cdw is enhanced by a magnetic field and appears to be connected to the high magnetic field state where quantum oscillations have been observed.@xcite indeed , recent work @xcite claims that the intrinsic @xmath8 of some underdoped ybco samples may be as low as 22  t , a shockingly low energy scale compared with the energy gap scale as well as @xmath9 . at the same time the onset of superconductivity causes a reduction of the cdw amplitude,@xcite suggesting that the pseudogap should be considered a competing phase . however , up to now the identity of this phase is not at all clear because the data seem to be giving conflicting signatures . </S>",
    "<S> certain features of the pseudogap state suggests the presence of short range superconducting order . for example , diamagnetic fluctuations are observed much above t@xmath1 @xcite and the spectral weight of the drude conductivity between members of the bilayers in ybco is found to increase below @xmath10180  k , a trend consistent with fluctuating superconductivity and opposite to gap formation due to charge order . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite on the other hand , the cdw is rather long ranged in the plane , but it does not resemble a conventional cdw driven by fermi surface nesting . a recent comparison of @xmath7 with the nesting vector connecting the fermi surfaces at the anti - nodal points in single layer bi@xmath11sr@xmath12la@xmath13cuo@xmath14 ( bi2201 ) found that @xmath7 is larger by about a factor of 2 . instead the cdw vector was suggested to connect the ends of the fermi arcs where the gap is zero or very small.@xcite this directly contradicts the standard cdw picture where an energy gap is expected at precisely that point ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we discuss in greater detail later , this difficulty is anticipated in an earlier study where detailed arpes data show that the spectrum contains highly anomalous features which can not be understood with a cdw model.@xcite in this paper we propose a new model for the pseudogap state which combines pairing and cdw and addresses all the mysterious properties described above .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is based on the idea of amperean pairing introduced earlier in the context of quantum spin liquids.@xcite the u(1 ) spin liquid is described by a spinon fermi surface coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field . in this system </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to transverse gauge field ( gauge magnetic field ) is strong and unscreened . just as in electrodynamics , </S>",
    "<S> the current of a carrier produces a gauge magnetic field which creates an attractive force to another carrier moving in the same direction , due to the ampere effect . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse gauge field mediated interaction contributes the following to the action,@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume , @xmath17 = 1/kt , @xmath18 is the velocity of the spinon with momentum @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the gauge field propagator and @xmath21 is the spinon destruction operator with spin @xmath22 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we showed that due to the singular nature of the gauge propagator , the fermi surface is unstable to a special kind of pairing where particles in the vicinity of a given spot @xmath23 on the fermi surface form cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this is radically different from conventional bcs pairing , which pair particles on opposite sides of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> we called this amperean pairing .    in one version of the rvb theory of high @xmath0 superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> a spinon fermi surface is formed which is coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field.@xcite unlike the spin liquid , there is also a gapless charge degree of freedom which is described by a bosonic holon coupled to the same gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> the bosons tend to condense and convert the spinons to electrons with a reduced spectral weight equal to @xmath24 , the hole doping concentration . </S>",
    "<S> while the gauge field is gapped by the anderson - higgs mechanism , the gap is small for small @xmath24 and gauge fluctuations remain important over a large temperature range , which is referred to as the incoherent fermi liquid region.@xcite since it is in this region that the pseudogap state is formed , it is reasonable to assume that the same amperean mechanism is at work and eq.(1 ) still applies . up to now </S>",
    "<S> the standard rvb picture is that d wave pairing of spinons onsets below a certain temperature.@xcite instead , we assume that the amperean pairing has a slightly lower free energy and pre - empts the d wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable because many states are competitive in energy with the d - wave state , including pair density wave states which share common properties with amperean pairing as discussed below.@xcite as we shall see , amperean pairing leaves segments of gapless excitations which contribute to a t linear entropy , exceeding the t@xmath25 term for d - wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , even if d - wave pairing is the true ground state , the amperean state can have a lower free energy above some temperature . in the cuprate it is natural to view the hole fermi surface as the analog of the large and almost circular fermi surface in the spin liquid problem . as shown in fig.1 ,     with momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 and similarly near @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the cooper pairs carry momentum @xmath29 and @xmath28 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> red lines mark some of the scans shown in fig.3 . </S>",

    "<S> it is convenient to measure all momenta from @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the mean field decoupling of eq.(1 ) @xmath31 where we have set @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 in eq.(1 ) and @xmath36 comes from the remainder of the equation and is proportional to a sum over @xmath37 of @xmath38 . instead of attempting a self consistent solution of the mean field equation , in this paper we simply assume a reasonable form of @xmath39 and explore the resulting quasiparticle structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is an essential first step because the quasiparticle spectrum is quite different from our intuition based on the convention bcs pairing . </S>",

    "<S> we see from eq.(2 ) that the pairing order parameters carry a total momentum of @xmath43 or @xmath44.@xcite this is because the pair is made up of two fermions moving in the same direction and the total momentum is @xmath45 . by choosing @xmath46 and @xmath47 to have the same amplitude , </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter is modulated in space as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this belongs to a general class of pairing which has been named pair density wave ( pdw).@xcite historically the first example of pdw is the loff state ( or more precisely the lo state ) where the pdw is argued to be more stable than the uniform state when the fermi surfaces are split by zeeman splitting.@xcite more recently another example has been introduced in connection with stripe formation in the lbco system near doping @xmath49.@xcite we shall refer to this as stripe pdw . </S>",
    "<S> there the spins form a spin density wave with wavevector @xmath50 which is interpreted as anti - phase neel states separated by charged domain walls which produces charge order at wavevector @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductor is assumed to be modulated at the same @xmath52 and interpreted as @xmath53 wave superconductors with anti - phase domains . </S>",
    "<S> the state was introduced to explain the observation that while a superconducting state exists much above @xmath0 within each layer , the layers fail to order coherently.@xcite indeed , the stripe pdw has been shown to be energetically competitive in earlier projected wavefunction studies @xcite and has been suggested as being stabilized in high magnetic fields.@xcite we note that the microscopic picture of this state is very different from our amperean pairing state . </S>",
    "<S> the stripe - pdw begins with the stripe picture of the sdw and up to now has been discussed only in connection with the stripe phenomena near @xmath54 . the amperean pairing picture is not associated with any sdw order . instead the wavevector is given in terms of fermi surface spanning vectors which _ decreases _ with increasing doping , a trend opposite to that of stripe pdw . </S>",
    "<S> the main driving force is the pairing energy which can be a high temperature scale . </S>",
    "<S> we may refer to our state as 2@xmath55 pdw . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in common with the stripe pdw , there is a cdw with period @xmath56 associated with amperean pairing . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite possible that amperean pairing help stabilize the stripe - pdw state in certain materials such as lbco which favor sdw ordering and stripe formation . </S>",
    "<S> the stripe pdw is then separated from the high temperature amperean pair state by the phase transition near 50k . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that in our view , amperean pairing is the driver and the cdw is a subsidiary order parameter .    </S>",

    "<S> here we present a phenomenological scenario applicable to the incommensurate case .    </S>",
    "<S> let us define the phases of the various order parameters as @xmath141 , @xmath142 . if @xmath143 the pairing is modulated in space as @xmath144 where @xmath145 plays the role of the overall pair phase while @xmath146 determines the location of the crests of the pdw . </S>",
    "<S> the term in the free energy @xmath147 is the phenomenological basis for generating the induced order @xmath148 and @xmath149.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite the @xmath150 order has so far not been observed . </S>",
    "<S> eq.(8 ) generates locking between the phases of the form @xmath151 . @xmath152 and @xmath153 appears to be independent , but there are subtleties associated with vortex formation.@xcite,@xcite nevertheless it is possible that phase fluctuations produced by conventional @xmath154 vortices can destroy the @xmath152 correlation while leaving @xmath153 intact . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is possible that the induced cdw order has long range order while the pairing is short range.@xcite in reality , disorder pinning limits the spatial order . for incommensurate @xmath52 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath153 can be set to zero by choosing the origin of @xmath155 and the locking term becomes simply @xmath156 . </S>",
    "<S> physically @xmath157 describes the relative location of the crests of the pdw and cdw . when it is locked to 0 or @xmath105 , </S>",
    "<S> reflection symmetry is preserved in the plane . </S>",
    "<S> a deviation of @xmath157 from 0 or @xmath105 can come from higher order terms in the free energy of the form @xmath158 etc . </S>",
    "<S> , which gives a locking term @xmath159 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath4 and @xmath160 are opposite in sign and @xmath161 the free energy has a minimum at @xmath162 thereby breaking the reflection symmetry in the plane . to break reflection symmetry along @xmath163 note that the stacking in the @xmath163 direction can take on two distinct forms : @xmath164 $ ] or @xmath165 $ ] , thereby introducing a sense of chirality . while we do not have a microscopic basis for the appearance of a finite @xmath166 , this argument at least offers the possibility that kerr rotation onset is associated with amperean pairing and checkerboard cdw order .    </S>",
    "<S> is there a way to directly detect the pdw ? </S>",
    "<S> the pairing response function @xmath167 can be measured @xcite by constructing a tunnel junction between an optimally doped cuprate superconductor and a material with a low t@xmath1 , such as bi-2201 and operate at a temperature between the two t@xmath1 s . </S>",
    "<S> the pair momentum is supplied by a parallel magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling current vs magnetic field and voltage is predicted to be proportional to @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the penetration depth of the superconductor ( assumed to be thick ) and d the barrier thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuating pdw will give rise to a peak in the tunneling current at @xmath172 corresponding to @xmath173 . </S>",
    "<S> the same experiment can be performed at low temperature using d wave or conventional s - wave superconductor . if the pdw co - exists with d wave pairing , a peak in the current is predicted to emerge at a field far greater than that expected for the fraunhofer pattern coming from the d - wave order . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of this peak will contain information about the degree of the pdw order . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the pdw may even develop long range order ( limited by disorder ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that a term @xmath174 is allowed , where @xmath175 is the d wave pairing order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this term pins the phase @xmath176 and since @xmath177 is assumed to be already locked , the individual phases @xmath178 will be pinned up to @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath179 may have long range order , in the phase where domain walls with @xmath105 phase shifts are not important . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the term in the landau free energy @xmath180 implies that a cdw with wave - vectors @xmath181 is predicted to appear in the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> it has come to our attention that stm measurements at 6k on optimally doped ybco has found charge ordering with two sets of ordering vectors at @xmath7 = 0.28 @xmath182 and 0.14 @xmath183 ( in units of @xmath125 ) along the x and y axes . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we would like to re - interpret these cdw s to correspond to our @xmath184 and @xmath185 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the recent discovery of cdw order at @xmath7 = 0.28 in optimally doped bisco lends support to this interpretation . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed by direct x - ray measurement , the appearance of @xmath185 in the superconducting state serves as a strong confirmation of our theory .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental advances have put severe constraints on the nature of the pseudo gap state . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of amperean pairing gives a consistent account of all the unusual phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be fully understood why long range order is not achieved below @xmath2 and above a small `` @xmath8 . '' </S>",
    "<S> phase fluctuations are presumably at play but a detailed thermal and quantum description of the short range ordered state will be highly desirable . if it is possible to increase the interlayer josephson tunneling by building artificial mbe structures , we expect phase fluctuations will be suppressed and it will be extremely interesting to see if a long range ordered amperean superconducting state at a relatively high temperature between @xmath9 and @xmath2 can be stabilized .    </S>",
