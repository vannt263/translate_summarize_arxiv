    "when the interaction between light and matter is strong , photons propagating in a dielectric can couple to excitons and form composite bose particles known as polaritons  @xcite .",
    "since these composite bosons have a light mass , there has long been interest in the possibility that they might undergo bose condensation at relatively high transition temperatures .",
    "while the concept of a bose condensate of bulk polaritons has been discussed extensively  @xcite , in the open system , low - energy polaritons are merely long wavelength photons , which are not conserved  @xcite . as a result , polaritons are unable to condense into the ground state making the bulk polariton condensate an intrinsically non - equilibrium phenomenon . however , providing the lifetime of the polaritons is long compared to the thermalization time , the confinement of the photons in a microcavity may allow for the development of a quasi - equilibrium condensate .    in recent years , improvements in the technology of semiconductor quantum wells",
    "has made the study of high - q strongly - coupled planar microcavities almost routine for iii - v , ii - vi and some organic semiconductors  @xcite . pumped both near resonance  @xcite ( i.e. the cavity is excited at a ` critical ' angle ) or non - resonantly  @xcite ( i.e. the system is excited at large angles ) , sharp superlinear increase of the low energy polariton photoluminescence has been observed .",
    "polaritons are characterised by a very short radiative lifetime ( of the order of @xmath0 ps ) due to leakage from the cavity .",
    "this has to be compared with the time scale to establish equilibrium with the lattice , @xmath1 , and the equilibration time of the polaritons themselves , @xmath2 ; the former controlled largely by exciton - phonon scattering and the latter by exciton - exciton scattering processes .",
    "dynamical ( or quasi - equilibrium ) condensation of polaritons can be reached when @xmath3 . due to the ` bottleneck effect '  @xcite ,",
    "thermalization of small momenta polaritons by acoustic phonons is suppressed , causing a slow relaxation of polaritons in the low energy state .",
    "this process is found to be strongly suppressed at higher values of the pump power where superlinear emission occurs  @xcite .",
    "recently , evidence of quasi - equilibrium condensation , where the polariton life time reaches the relaxation time , including second order coherence in the optical field , has been observed  @xcite .    within a bosonic picture involving tightly bound excitons ,",
    "much work has been published on polariton dynamics under non - resonant excitation , e.g. by making use of a rate equation approach  @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on the signatures of the fermionic nature of polaritons when the excitation density increases . here ,",
    "the theoretical framework is not fully established even in the case of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the relative role of coulomb forces ( i.e. direct interaction between electron - hole pairs ) and photon mediated interactions has not been studied .",
    "there is also an incomplete understanding of the effects of disorder , inelastic scattering and ` decoherence ' phenomena , this being very important in drawing a distinction between polariton condensation and conventional lasing .",
    "furthermore , previous theories , including those that incorporate effects due to disorder and decoherence , have been at the mean field level .",
    "our aim here is to address all three of these issues .      beginning with the pioneering work of keldysh and coworkers  @xcite ,",
    "the continuous transition between the bose condensed and bcs - like phase of the equilibrium electron - hole system has been discussed within the framework of a mean - field theory characterised by an order parameter involving the coherent polarisation .",
    "refinements of the mean - field theory by comte and nozires  @xcite to include the effects of screening provided a consistent theory of the electron - hole liquid and condensate phases . in recent years",
    ", considerable efforts have been made to explore the influence of light - matter interaction in the non - equilibrium electron system driven by an external phase coherent laser source  the optical stark effect  @xcite .",
    "however , only recently has the effect of quantum phase coherent coupling of photons and excitons in the closed system been addressed .",
    "cavity polaritons interact both directly via the coulomb coupling of their excitonic part , and indirectly via occupancy constraints on the excitonic component , sometimes referred to as phase - space filling .",
    "since polariton masses are typically very small , the coherence temperature increases rapidly with number density . once the characteristic interaction energy , either the dipole coupling energy or the coulomb interaction , is larger than the coherence temperature of free polaritons , one must use an interacting theory .",
    "if the density is still low enough that excitons are not strongly overlapping , an appropriate approximation is to treat the excitons as bosons with a short range repulsion , or equivalently as two level systems . however , if the exciton density is high enough that the excitons become unbound then the separate electron and hole ( fermionic ) degrees of freedom are recovered .",
    "note then that there are at least two and generally three crossovers as a function of increasing excitation : from a dilute gas of weakly interacting polaritons to a strong coupling regime , where nevertheless excitons are bound ; then to a regime where the density of excitons is high enough that they unbind ( and which may be weakly coupled to light , in the sense that the rabi frequency is small in comparison to the kinetic energy ) .",
    "if , as is usual , the latter regime is one of weak coupling , nevertheless at high enough excitation one may reach a strong coupling regime where the optical field provides the largest scale in the problem .",
    "it is in the intermediate , fermionic , regime of weak coupling , that conventional semiconductor lasers operate  @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical work has addressed the question of the existence of coherent , condensed polariton states in a simplified model .",
    "taking just a single cavity photon mode , polariton condensation has been explored within the framework of an effective ` zero - dimensional ' model in which excitons are trapped in isolated quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "treated as two - level systems , the hamiltonian for the coupled exciton - photon system can be presented as a dicke model .",
    "the model allows for an inhomogeneous broadening of the levels , while a quasi - equilibrium condition was imposed by fixing the total number of excitations . at the level of mean - field ( which becomes exact when the number of exciton states coupled by the same microcavity field is large )",
    ", the ground state of the polariton system can be written as a variational wave function .",
    "this wave function is a superposition of coherent states of the exciton and photon in which both the amplitude of the cavity field and the electron polarisation acquire a non - zero expectation value .    within the same two - level system model , the effect of decoherence processes",
    "have recently been studied in  @xcite .",
    "treated again at the mean - field level , decoherence gradually suppresses the excitonic component of the order parameter , driving the system toward a gapless , weak - coupling regime similar to that of a conventional laser .",
    "although the zero - dimensional system does provide intuition about the collective properties of the polariton condensate , by its construction , it is not able to discriminate between the bec and bcs - like character of the condensate phase in the low and high density limits .",
    "furthermore , the restriction of the model to a single cavity photon mode does not allow for the consideration of fluctuations and dispersion of the excitations in the polariton condensate phase .",
    "finally , in the two - level formulation , coulomb interaction is not considered self - consistently , and both at mean - field level and beyond mean - field , the coherent polarisation and the coherent photon field are locked together . among other consequences",
    ", this means that in this model the screening of coulomb interaction by an increase of the density of excitations can not be taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "such an effect is mimicked by the fermionic space filling effect , which also has the result of increasing the photon component at high excitation levels .    in the following",
    ", we will tune the strength of the light - matter interaction so as to explore the interplay of exciton and polariton condensation in a quasi two - dimensional microcavity system . here , in contrast to the localised exciton theory , one can expect weak potential disorder to impact strongly on the integrity of the condensate phase  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to keep our discussion general , we will include the symmetry - breaking effect of a weak potential disorder on the condensate .",
    "although the mean - field theory has the capacity to describe the entire continuous interpolation between the low density bec phase and the high density bcs - like phase , for simplicity , we will limit our analysis of the mean - field theory and fluctuations to the high density phase .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian for the coupled electron - hole / photon system can be separated into constituent components according to @xmath4 here , @xmath5 represents the interacting hamiltonian of the electron and hole degrees of freedom in a semi - conducting quantum well , while @xmath6 describes the random potential generated by quenched impurities and lattice defects .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the hamiltonian associated with the cavity photons and finally @xmath8 represents the exciton - photon dipole coupling interaction .",
    "following the notation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and adopting an ` electron picture ' in which @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) represent the annihilation and creation operators of an electron with momentum @xmath13 in the conductance ( valence ) band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eband ] ) , the hamiltonian for a direct band - gap semiconductor is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total electron density operator . here , for simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the electrons are spinless . taking the middle of the gap as the energy reference",
    ", we assume a parabolic conduction and valence band of particles @xmath16 where , for simplicity , we have assumed the electrons and holes exhibit the same effective mass , @xmath17 . at the level of mean - field",
    ", one can confirm that this assumption is innocuous and corresponds to replacing the effective mass with the double of the reduced mass .",
    "in contrast , deviation from parabolicity in the physical system impairs the capacity for perfect nesting of the fermi surface and reduces the potential for pair correlation .",
    "finally , for convenience , we have introduced in eq .",
    "the concept of an effective fermi energy @xmath18 , which , along with the chemical potential @xmath19 , is determined self - consistently as a non - trivial function of the total number of excitations in the system   ( see later in section  [ sec : chemi ] ) .",
    "in addition to the lattice potential , the electrons and holes experience a coulomb interaction . in the _ high density regime _",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the areal density of the particles , ( i.e. when the the excitonic bohr radius @xmath22 is much larger than the average distance between electron and holes @xmath23 ) , the coulomb interaction is screened due to both electrons and holes  @xcite : @xmath24 in the two - dimensional system , the screening length is approximately set by the bohr radius @xmath25 .",
    "hence , in this limit , the coulomb interaction can be replaced by a short range contact interaction  @xcite , @xmath26 with a strength given by the angular average over the fermi surface @xmath27 here @xmath28 denotes the rydberg energy associated with the exciton and sets the characteristic energy scale of the interaction . therefore , as a consequence of the screening , an increase in the total number of electronic excitations leads to a reduction in the effective strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "notice that , although the condensed state may have a gap , we shall be discussing the dense limit , where the coherence length is much longer than @xmath29 , and so this will not influence the important short range part of the potential .    ) and conductance ( @xmath30 ) band , and the interactions included in the model  . ]    to incorporate the effect of disorder , we suppose that the electron - hole system is subject to a generic weak impurity potential , @xmath31 \\ ; . \\ ] ] naively , since the electrons and holes carry opposite charge , their response to potential impurities should be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign .",
    "however , differences in the dielectric properties of the conduction and valence band electrons , combined with the potential asymmetry imposed by the quasi two - dimensional geometry , implies that the potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not perfectly anticorrelated .",
    "furthermore , there are mechanisms of disorder such as variations in the width of the quantum well through atomic terracing , strain fields , etc . ,",
    "that act on electrons and holes with the same sign .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will suppose that a generic disorder potential is comprised of two channels : a potential @xmath34/2 $ ] which acts symmetrically as a ` charge - neutral ' potential and , as we will see , does not effect the integrity of the condensate phase .",
    "a second , statistically independent , potential @xmath35/2 $ ] acts as an asymmetric ` charged ' component , and presents a pair - breaking perturbation which gradually destroys the excitonic condensate .",
    "as mentioned above , its effect in the dense exciton system on the integrity of the exciton insulator phase has been explored in an early work by zittartz  @xcite . in both cases",
    ", we will suppose that the potentials @xmath36 are drawn at random from a gaussian white - noise distribution , with zero mean , and variance given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the associated scattering times , and @xmath40 is the two - dimensional density of states of the spinless electron system .",
    "restricting attention to the high density phase , setting @xmath41 , we will further suppose that the impurity potential impose only a weak perturbation on the electron and hole degrees of freedom , allowing therefore the dynamics to be treated quasi - classically .",
    "this completes the description of the electron - hole system .",

    ", we will suppose that the electron - hole system engages just a single sub - band for which @xmath47 . in practice , providing the sub - band separation is substantially larger than the quasi - particle energy gap that develops in the electron - hole system , neighboring sub - bands can be safely neglected .",

    "on one hand , we expect this approximation to be valid in the weak coupling limit between photon and matter , where these additional terms can be ` integrated out ' , giving a small ` renormalisation ' of the single particle electronic and photonic dispersion laws . at the same time , since we are dealing with a system where the temperature is much smaller than the photon frequency , we can neglect the tiny spontaneous population that would be generated by these non - resonant terms .    to mimic the effect of the external photon source , we suppose that the electron - hole / photon system is held in quasi - equilibrium by tuning the chemical potential @xmath19 in   to fix the total number of excitations @xmath49 however , how the system chooses to portion the excitations between the electron - hole and photon degrees of freedom depends sensitively on the properties of the condensate .",
    "this completes the formal construction of the microscopic many - body hamiltonian . in order to explore the mean - field content and the collective excitations of the light - matter system",
    ", we will draw on the theory of the weakly disordered superconductor . using conventional field theoretic methods",
    ", we will show that the low - energy properties of the system can be cast in the framework of an effective field theory with an action of non - linear sigma - model type  @xcite . partitioning our discussion into properties of the mean - field content of the theory and the role of fluctuations , we will focus on the phase diagram of the system as a function of density and disorder on one side , and the nature of the collective excitations on the other .",
    "since the field theory technology disguises much of the physical content , we will close the introduction with an overview of the findings of the mean - field theory .",
    "as well as summarising the main results , it will provide a useful prospective for the formal analysis .     and",

    "this reproduces the mean - field thermodynamic properties of a system subject only to a ` charged ' weakly disorder potential , @xmath60 . by analysing these mean - field equations , the generalisation of those derived by zittartz  @xcite for the exciton insulator system",
    ", we will describe the rearrangement of the ground state due to condensate formation .",
    "in particular , we will show that the condensate of the polariton system is characterised by an order parameter which engages the combination of the phase locked polarisation and photon amplitudes . the mean - field phase diagram ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] ) can be characterised in terms of the total density of excitations , @xmath51 , the disorder strength @xmath61 and the following dimensionless material parameters , respectively the coupling to the photon field and the coulomb coupling strength ( see expression  ): @xmath62 here , the constant of proportionality @xmath63 depends on the thickness @xmath64 of the quantum well , @xmath65 denotes the characteristic energy separation between the photon band edge and the chemical potential ( measured in units of the rydberg ) , and @xmath66 .",

    "when the density @xmath51 is low , the majority of excitations are invested in electrons and holes ( see figure  [ fig : nehph ] ) and therefore , as the density increases , the chemical potential rises linearly . here , providing the density is large enough to keep the particles unbound , the condensed phase is reminiscent of the exciton insulator one , even if a small fraction of photons do contribute to the condensate ( see the inset of figure  [ fig : nehph ] ) .",
    "eventually , as the chemical potential approaches the band edge , @xmath71 , the photons are brought into resonance and the character of the condensate changes abruptly . here",
    ", the excitations become increasingly photon - like , with @xmath51 diverging exponentially when the chemical potential converges on @xmath71 . at the same time , screening suppresses the excitonic coupling constant , determining the majority of the excitation in the condensate to acquire a photon - like character .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure  [ fig : nehph ] , where the normalised number of _ total _ electrons @xmath72 and photons @xmath73 ( see eq .  ) are plotted as a function of the density of excitations . in the inset of the picture , instead , the fraction of photons to excitons _ in the condensate _ ( for the exact definition , see later on , eq .  ) clearly shows an abrupt growth as the density of excitations in increased above the value @xmath74 , which we will see to coincide with the maximum density which can be reached at @xmath75 in absence of photons .",
    "staying at the level of mean - field , the ` charged ' component of the disorder potential presents a symmetry breaking perturbation which depletes the excitonic component of the condensate . as such , its effect on the condensate depends sensitively on the density of excitations . when @xmath76 , the condensate has a particle - hole character and the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) mimics the behaviour of the symmetry broken exciton insulator  @xcite  and therefore of a superconducting system in presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "when the scattering rate @xmath39 is comparable to the value of the unperturbed order parameter , the system enters a gapless phase before the condensate is extinguished altogether . at larger densities ,",
    "the condensate becomes photon - dominated and therefore robust against any value of the disorder potential .",
    "interestingly , however , the residual effect of the disorder exposes a substantial region of the phase diagram where the system is gapless .",

    "taken at the level of the mean - field approximation , the transition to the condensed phase would be associated with the development of a sharp coherent peak in the density distribution at @xmath325 . however , in the quasi two - dimensional quantum well geometry , the proliferation of massless phase modes destroys true long range order . instead , the bulk transition to the condensed phase is of berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type  @xcite . in this case , one expects the bulk transition to be reflected in the development of power - law correlations in the density distribution . strictly speaking , to infer the characteristic power - law dependence of the correlations , one should restore gauge invariance of the action under global phase rotations .",
    "however , guided by a parallel investigation of trapped excitons in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can infer the nature of the long ranged correlations simply from the spectrum of the phase mode determined above .    in the present case",
    "the calculation is complicated slightly by the fact that , to establish the impact of the massless collective fluctuations on the photon distribution , one must find their projection onto the phase mode associated with the photon field .",
    "this , in turn , introduces a ` form factor ' which reflects the superfluid stiffness .",
    "then , when parameterized as @xmath326 , discarding massive fluctuations , one obtains the characteristic power - law divergence  @xcite @xmath327 with the ( superfluid ) stiffness given by @xmath328 ^ 2}{\\tilde{g}^2 } }    { \\displaystyle\\frac{a_2}{2 } } \\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{\\xi_{\\text{coh}}}{l}}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{\\mathcal{r}y}\\psi^2    \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath282 is the superconducting coherence length .",
    "the corresponding spatial correlation function assumes the characteristic logarithmic divergence at long distances : @xmath329 ^ 2\\rangle \\operatorname*{\\simeq}_{|{{\\mathbf r}}| \\to \\infty }    { \\displaystyle\\frac{k_{{\\text{\\sc{b } } } } t}{2\\pi \\rho_s } } \\ln    \\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{|{{\\mathbf r}}|}{\\xi_{t}}}\\right)\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath330 represents the thermal length .",
    "restoring gauge invariance , and noting that the dominant contribution to the amplitude mode comes from mean - field , we obtain : @xmath331 this integral can be exactly evaluated in two - dimensions , giving , for temperatures @xmath332 , the result : @xmath333 as noted at the end of section  [ sec : gaple ] , when @xmath239 , the amplitude and phase modes coincide and , in particular , the phase mode acquires a mass proportional to the distance from the critical point . here , in the non - condensed phase ,",
    "the density distribution asymptotes to a constant at small @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the properties of a model for cavity polaritons in the high density regime , where the interplay between coulomb interaction , the photon mediated coupling and the effect of disorder in the quantum well gives rise to different domains in the phase diagram .",
    "changing the density , we have shown that the character of the condensate changes from being excitonic in character to photonic .",
    "the effective coupling constant is determined by the sum of the direct screened coulomb interaction and the effective interaction induced by the exchange of photons . when the condensate has largely excitonic character , we have shown that the ` charged ' disorder presents a pair - breaking channel which destabilises the condensate phase .",
    "increasing the density of excitations , the system moves towards a region dominated by photons . here",
    ", the increasing insensitivity of the condensate to disorder inhibits the complete quenching of coherence , while leaving open the possibility of a gapless region where the condensate manifests the properties of a semiconductor laser . in the condensed phase , across the whole range of densities",
    ", we have determined the spectrum of collective excitations .",
    "the parameter regimes we have explored are in principle accessible in semiconductor microcavities . in iii - v and ii - vi semiconductors ,",
    "microcavities have been constructed with measured values of the rabi splitting approaching @xmath334  @xcite , and even larger values for an organic semiconductor  @xcite . since the exciton rydberg and inverse density of states take values similar to or smaller than this energy ( depending on material ) , the dimensionless photon coupling @xmath180 can be made of order unity . to reach the high density ` plasma ' regime for the electron - hole system",
    ", one must obtain electron - hole densities @xmath335 of order unity or greater , but this is indeed the typical operating density of a semiconductor laser .",
    "indeed semiconductor lasers are conventionally modelled as a degenerate electron - hole plasma , though of course their operation is conventionally at temperatures somewhat larger than the rydberg .",
    "perhaps more important than their temperature is that real lasers are open systems and thus have dynamical decoherence and dephasing processes that we have not included here . to the extent",
    "that pair - breaking by static disorder mimics dynamically induced decoherence , we may interpret the pair - breaking parameter @xmath256 as the dephasing rate @xmath336 introduced into laser rate equations . with this identification parameters for a conventional laser  @xcite",
    "are indeed well in the limit @xmath337 .    as a final remark , for the clean system , the model considered in this work bears similarity with that discussed in the context of atomic condensation .",
    "the polariton hamiltonian considered in this work has been used by many to model the atom / molecule interaction in a fermi system positioned close to a feshbach resonance ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with an appropriate dictionary of correspondence , both the mean - field content of the theory as well as the spectrum of collective excitations can be compared in the two systems .",
    "as outlined in section  [ sec : excit ] , the second variation @xmath338 + \\delta s_{\\text{ph } + \\sigma}$ ] of the total action is given by two contributions , one coming from the action for the semiclassical green function   and the other from the photonic   and excitonic   actions .",
    "starting with the first contribution , we consider the parameterization   for the @xmath339 matrix and linearize the equation of motion   in the fluctuation terms @xmath340 and @xmath341 , @xmath342 -    { \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2\\tau_c } } [ \\bar{q } , \\sigma_3 \\sigma_3^{{\\text{\\sc{cc } } } } \\bar{q } w    \\sigma_3 \\sigma_3^{{\\text{\\sc{cc } } } } ] \\\\",

    "the equation for @xmath340 can be easily solved in term of the components @xmath345 .",
