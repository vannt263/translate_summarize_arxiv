    "a variety of processes in biological cells are performed and controlled by large protein complexes rather than single proteins .",

    "contemporary structural biology and molecular biophysics are thus concerned with understanding of ever larger and more dynamically complex molecular assemblies .",
    "force spectroscopy is a powerful method to study mechanical properties of single biopolymers and biomolecular assemblies .",
    "a typical force spectroscopy experiment uses atomic force microscope ( afm ) , or optical tweezers , to measure the response of a biomolecular system to stretching , squeezing , or torsional manipulation @xcite .",
    "these experiments have provided a variety of information on transport and force generation in cells , dna replication and transcription @xcite , dna unknotting and unwinding @xcite , atp synthesis in mitochondria @xcite , mechanical behavior of virus capsids under squeezing @xcite , and other biologically relevant problems .",
    "there is a growing recent interest in theoretical and experimental assessments of mechanical stability of protein complexes .",
    "if there are no covalent bonds between individual proteins then stretching by the afm tip may result in dissociation of the complex , unraveling of the constituent proteins , or both .",
    "the outcome reflects the strength of the binding forces and the structural organization of the complex .",
    "examples of the systems considered so far include the titin z1z2-telethonin @xcite , dimeric tubulin @xcite , the 3@xmath0 domain - swapped cystatin @xcite , oligomeric fibrinogen @xcite , covalently and non - covalently linked homo - dimeric systems with the cystine knot motif @xcite , and the homo - trimeric capsomers of the ccmv virus capsid @xcite . in particular , dima and joshi @xcite have identified a viscoelastic behavior in unraveling of the intermeric couplings of tubulin chains . in distinction to the fibrous systems @xcite , there is no physiologically motivated direction of pulling in the cystine knot , capsomer , and cystatine complexes @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the response to stretching has been found to be strongly anisotropic : it depends on which site the tip is attached to and which site serves as an anchor .",
    "this is a significant extension of the anisotropy phenomena that have been observed in monomeric proteins @xcite .    in this paper , we direct our attention to the anisotropic effects arising in mechanical manipulation of heterodimers . as an illustration we consider a cell adhesion complex in which mechanical manipulation may lead either to unfolding , or to dissociation , or to both effects combined , depending on the geometry of pulling . specifically , we focus on the murine cd48 - 2b4 complex @xcite with the protein data bank structure code of 2ptt .",
    "protein 2b4 is a heterophilic receptor present at the surface of natural killer cells .",
    "the antigenic cd48 proteins are expressed on surfaces of various immune cells .",
    "interactions of cd48 with 2b4 regulate the activity of the natural killer cells , which are components of the innate immunity against tumors and virally infected cells .",
    "even though the cd48 - 2b4 complex appears not to have been studied through the single molecule manipulation techniques yet , it serves as a convenient system for theoretical epxlorations .",
    "the crystal structure of the cd48 - 2b4 complex that we use in this study comprises two extracellular immunoglobulin - like domains : the c2-type domain of cd48 ( shown in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) , and the cd48-binding domain of 2b4 ( shown in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "these domains comprise 110 and 112 amino acid residues , respectively , which means that the cd48 - 2b4 system is too large for a thorough all - atom molecular dynamics study on relevant time scales . here",
    ", we use a coarse - grained structure - based model to study the response of the cd48 - 2b4 complex to stretching at constant speed . for simplicity",
    ", we consider stretching only by the terminal sites .",
    "some ways of choosing them may result in partial or complete unfolding of the constituent proteins , and other may lead to splitting of the complex into separate parts .",
    "we explore the roles of the inter- and intra - protein interactions in the competing processes of unfolding and dissociation of the cd48 - 2b4 complex .    the 2b4 receptor binds to cd48 with a modest strength , with the equilibrium dissociation constant in the low micromolar range and very fast on and off rates @xcite . in the native state ,",
    "19 residues of 2b4 are in contact with 16 residues of cd48 , and most of the contacting residues belong to loops and turns in cd48 and in 2b4 .",
    "the cd48 - 2b4 interface involves only 36 contacts , as determined by atomic overlaps ( see the methods section ) , and one of our focal points is quantitative analysis of how and when these contacts break during the dissociation process .",
    "we find that the dissociation scenarios as well as the force - displacement patterns depend sensitively on the choice of the termini that are used to implement stretching . in some cases",
    ", the proteins separate without any noticeable deformations or structural changes ; in other cases , cd48 unfolds partially before the proteins dissociate .",
    "however , the inter - protein contacts always break in groups rather than sequentially .",
    "the 36 contacts between cd48 and 2b4 can be divided into three distinct patches , which are denoted here as a , b , and c , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "we find that the three interface patches cooperate as units in resisting the stretching forces .",
    "we also find that a significant resistance to stretching arises due to two types of mechanical clamps , which involve shear and tensile forces , respectively . in shearing ,",
    "two @xmath1-strands slide by , see the left - hand panel of fig .  [ shearvstensil ] . in tensile strain ,",
    "the separation between two residues in contact increases along the line connecting them , as illustrated in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ shearvstensil ] .",
    "some choices of the pulling termini generate merely tensile effects , followed by separation of the protein complex .",
    "other choices involve both types of mechanical clamps , in which case several force peaks arise on the path to separation .",
    "the largest of the force peaks needs not be tensile in origin , and its height is not necessarily related to the binding strength of the complex .",
    "this observation is relevant for the interpretation of force spectroscopy experiments on protein complexes .",
    "since there is no force spectroscopy data on the cd48 - 2b4 complex that we could compare with our simulation results , we also simulate stretching of synaptotagmin  1 , which is a membrane - trafficking multidomain protein that has been studied thoroughly in single - molecule pulling experiments @xcite .",
    "synaptotagmin  1 facilitates fusion of synaptic vesicles .",
    "its cytoplasmic part is composed of two domains , c2a and c2b , which together form the c2ab complex .",
    "our simulation results agree with experimental findings .",
    "in particular , we find that c2ab is significantly less stable than the i27 domain of titin , and that the c2a domain in the complex is less stable mechanically than its c2b partner .",
    "we use our coarse - grained structure - based model @xcite , in which each amino acid residue is represented by a single bead centered on its c@xmath2 position .",
    "the beads are tethered together into chains by strong harmonic potentials with the spring constant @xmath3@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the depth of the potential well associated with the native contacts , which serves as the basic energy scale in our model .",
    "the native contacts are identified using an overlap criterion @xcite applied to the coordinates of all heavy atoms in the native structure .",
    "however , the amino acid pairs that are very close sequentially , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are excluded from the contact map @xcite . it should be noted than our scheme to identify native contacts is different than in , for example , self - organized polymer model @xcite where a uniform length cutoff is used .",
    "the interactions within the native contacts are described by the lennard - jones potential @xmath8 \\label{eq:6 - 12}\\ ] ] here , @xmath9 is the distance between residues @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the contact , and the parameters @xmath12 are chosen so that each contact in the native structure is stabilized at the minimum of the lennard - jones potential .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is approximately given by @xmath13  pn   , as has been determined by comparing simulational results to the experimental ones on a set of 38 proteins @xcite .",
    "the contacts between the proteins are treated in the same manner as the contacts within the proteins as both sets are dominated by hydrogen bonds .",

    "the solvent is implicit and the system evolves in time according to the langevin dynamics .",
    "the overall force acting on a particular bead @xmath10 is a sum of three terms : ( i ) the direct force @xmath17 that derives from all the potential terms , ( ii ) the damping force that is proportional to the velocity of the bead , and ( iii ) the random force , @xmath18 , that represents thermal noise .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion @xmath19 are solved by the fifth order predictor - corrector algorithm with the time step of @xmath20 . here , @xmath21 is the damping coefficient and all beads are assumed to have the same mass @xmath22 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the native contacts can break during the time evolution .",
    "our criterion for this to happen is that the distance between residues @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a contact exceeds @xmath29 .",
    "stretching of the cd48 - 2b4 complex is implemented by attaching harmonic springs to two terminal amino acids .",
    "one of the springs is fixed in space and the other one is moved with a constant speed , @xmath30 , so that the distance it travels in time @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "the force constant of the pulling springs is taken as @xmath33@xmath34 , which corresponds to about 1  pn / nm and is close to the elasticity of typical afm cantilevers @xcite .    in our simulations , the response force , @xmath35 , acting on the pulling spring is measured and averaged over time periods that correspond to the spring displacements of 0.5   @xcite .",

    "we now turn our attention to the process of cd48 - 2b4 separation .",
    "the separation event takes place at the moment when no contacts are present between cd48 and 2b4 for the first time on the trajectory .",
    "the corresponding spring displacement at which separation takes place will be denoted by @xmath91 .",
    "s2 in si shows that @xmath91 decreases with @xmath30 in a way that depends on the protocol and the pathway .",
    "its most significant dependence is observed for pathway 2 in protocal n - c@xmath52 , which is the pathway that finds no continuation at small speeds .",
    "the decrease in @xmath91 reflects the greater role of thermal fluctuations at lower speeds since fluctuations foster separation .",
    "the spring displacement @xmath36 does not directly relate to the end - to - end distance , @xmath92 , between the pulling termini .",
    "in fact , @xmath92 reflects transformations in the structure in a more direct manner .",
    "s3 in si shows that @xmath93 ",
    "i.e. the value of @xmath92 corresponding to separation  also depends on @xmath30 , although usually less sensitively .",
    "for instance , there is much less variation in @xmath93 compared to @xmath91 in the c - c@xmath52 protocol . on the other hand",
    ", they are about the same for both pathways in the n - c@xmath52 protocol .      to our knowledge",
    ", there have been no single - molecule pulling experiments performed on the cd48 - 2b4 complex .",
    "thus the assumptions underlying the construction of our model , especially about the relative strength of the inter - protein contacts remain untested . to establish connections to force spectroscopy experiments on membrane - associated multidomain proteins , we performed pulling simulations of synaptotagmin  1 .",
    "the latter protein is involved in remodeling the plasma membrane during neurotransmitter release at the synapse .",
    "the cytoplasmic region of synaptotagmin  1 contains two domains , c2a and c2b , which together form the c2ab module .",
    "these two domains are quite similar structurally but have been found to exhibit different mechanical stabilities within the c2ab module @xcite .",
    "the issue which is analogous to that pertaining to the cd48 - 2b4 complex is whether it is indeed sensible to assume that the inter - domain contact energy , which we denote here by @xmath94 , is about the same as the contact energy @xmath5 within each domain .",
    "[ synaptotagmin1 ] shows a typical @xmath35-@xmath36 curve and the corresponding scenario diagram for @xmath95 and @xmath69  /@xmath28 .",
    "the highest force peak ( labelled as b in fig .",
    "[ synaptotagmin1 ] ) is associated with rupturing the core of the c2b domain .",
    "the second highest peak ( labeled as a in fig .  [ synaptotagmin1 ] ) arises when @xmath40 and @xmath45 of the c2a domain unravel .",
    "this event is followed by breaking the c2ab interface , which results in a minor force peak ( labeled by i in fig .",
    "[ synaptotagmin1 ] ) .",
    "a typical simulation configuration at this stage is depicted in the lower right corner of fig .",
    "[ synaptotagmin1 ] .",
    "it is similar to the relevant configuration obtained in steered molecular dynamics simulations performed at a pulling speed that is three orders of magnitude larger than used here @xcite .",
    "after extrapolation to the experimental pulling speed , see fig .",
    "[ synaptotagmin1 ] , we obtain the values of @xmath37 to be equal to @xmath96  pn and @xmath97  pn for the force peaks b and a , respectively",
    ". these values are consistent with the experimental results of about 100  pn and 50  pn ( with the statistical error of about 20  pn ) for the c2b and c2a domains @xcite .",
    "we now consider the situation in which @xmath94 is distinct from @xmath5 .",
    "we find that if @xmath98 then the c2a domain becomes much more stable than the c2b domain , which disagrees with experimental findings . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath99 then the second highest force peak becomes associated with rupturing the core of the c2a domain rather than with unraveling of @xmath40 and @xmath45 , see fig .",
    "s4 in si . however , the characteristic forces ( @xmath100/ and @xmath101/ for c2a and c2b , respectively , at @xmath69  /@xmath28 ) are very close to those presented in fig .",
    "[ synaptotagmin1 ] ( @xmath102/ and @xmath103/ ) at the same speed of pulling .",
    "nevertheless , the appearance of the whole @xmath35-@xmath36 pattern is much closer to the experimental one when @xmath95 than when @xmath94 is reduced .",
    "we therefore conclude that assuming the equality of @xmath94 and @xmath5 is consistent with the experimental results and with the similarity of the physical nature of the interdomain contacts .",
    "the mechanical stability of adhesion proteins and their complexes is necessary to sustain interactions and signaling between cells . to investigate the mechanical stability of the adhesion protein complex cd48 - 2b4 , we have performed pulling simulations using our coarse - grained structure - based model .",
    "we find that the force peaks arise either as a result of shear between @xmath1-strands in cd48 or due to tensile mechanical clamps between cd48 and 2b4 , depending on the mode of pulling and dissociation pathway .",
    "if there are several force peaks in a given @xmath104 curve then , in general , the maximal one may be associated with shear or with the tensile separation . in the former case",
    ", the measurement of @xmath37 would not provide an estimate of the adhesion forces .",
    "table [ table ] provides a summary of our findings regarding the values of @xmath37 for various protocols of stretching . for a given @xmath30 ,",
    "the table is symmetric .",
    "we present it in a way which gives values of @xmath37 for two pulling speeds : above the diagonal the data correspond to @xmath30 of @xmath105  /@xmath28  the standard used in our surveys of mechanostability @xcite  and below the diagonal they correspond to @xmath106  /@xmath28 , which is in the lower range of speeds used in protein - related afm experiments @xcite .",
    "the highlighted diagonal blocks in the table correspond to same - chain pulling which results either in structure unfolding ( n - c ) or just deformation ( n@xmath52-c@xmath52 ) .",
    "the off - diagonal blocks correspond to pulling of different chains which results in dissociation .",
    "the @xmath30 dependencies are seen to be comparable in these two classes of pullings , and dissociation may come either with a smaller or larger @xmath37 than unraveling .",
    "we observe existence of strong anisotropies . for dissociation ,",
    "@xmath37 varies between 0.9 and 1.7 @xmath5/ at the extrapolated experimental speed . for unraveling  between 1.35 and 1.55 @xmath5/ .",
    "in the n - c protocol , and also on the first pathway of the n - c@xmath52 protocol , @xmath37 is caused by shear between @xmath1-strands in cd48 .",
    "in other pulling protocols , @xmath37 is due to tensile mechanical clamps between cd48 and 2b4 .",
    "it is important to note that the largest force signal during dissociation may actually come from shearing and not tensile separation .",
    "both cd48 and 2b4 are anchored in membranes through the c - terminal ends @xcite .",
    "the forces acting on the cd48 - 2b4 complex during cell adhesion are thus applied in the c - c@xmath52 direction ( although membrane fluctuations on nanometer scales may alter this direction to some extent @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that in the c - c@xmath52 pulling simulations neither cd48 nor 2b4 unravels ( both proteins maintain their structure ) and the entire cd48 - 2b4 interface acts as a whole to resist external forces with @xmath107  @xmath5/ at the experimental speed of pulling .",
    "the latter value corresponds to about 150  pn .",
    "these results suggest that the cd48 - 2b4 complex is adapted to resist significant forces while maintaining the structure of individual proteins .",
    "in particular , the disulfide bond between cys  3 and cys  100 prevents the rupturing of contacts within 2b4 .    *",
