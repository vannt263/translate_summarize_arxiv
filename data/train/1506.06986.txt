    "the universe is expanding at an increasing rate supported by various observations such as supernova type 1a explosions , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao)@xcite . there is a need for a kind of energy to fill roughly @xmath3 of the universe that causes the late time accelerated expansion . the @xmath2-cold dark matter",
    "( cdm ) model is currently the best cosmological model explaining this expansion .",
    "it is assumed that the cosmological constant , @xmath2 , may arise from vacuum fluctuations .",
    "however , there is a large ( at least sixty orders of magnitude ) discrepancy between the predicted energy density of the vacuum in particle physics ( of the order @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the planck mass ) and the energy density of the cosmological constant obtained from fitting the @xmath2cdm model predictions to observations , i.e. @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is called the cosmological constant problem and many models have been proposed to overcome this problem .",
    "one of those that relates the vacuum energy to the qcd vacuum has been proposed by f. r. urban and a. r. zhitnitsky @xcite at which veneziano ghost field was firstly considered as a candidate for the late time acceleration .",
    "veneziano first proposed this field as a ghost by putting a minus sign into the propagator with the aim of solving the @xmath7 problem .",
    "this field is called ghost , since it describes the long range interactions of qcd @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the model proposed by urban and zhitnitsky",
    ", the qcd vacuum energy is related to the fundamental qcd parameters and it is in the order of @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the hubble parameter , light quark mass , light quark condensate and mass of the @xmath11 meson , respectively .",
    "this energy density is in the same order of magnitude with the observations implying that the vacuum energy can be considered as qcd vacuum .",
    "the idea of using qcd in cosmology is not new ; such that ample knowledge of qcd at finite baryon density and temperature has been used to understand a wide range of phenomena in cosmology such as the structure of neutron stars , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and so on . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that different phases of qcd at finite temperature and density lead to interesting effects . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is stated that the gravity may be a low energy effective theory of qcd , instead of being a fundamental interaction .",
    "it is believed that at very high temperatures ( higher than the critical temperature ) , the quark condensates are not formed and the universe consists of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the equation of state ( eos ) parameter of qgp is investigated .",
    "the standard calculations in qcd are generally performed in minkowski space - time with topological susceptibility @xmath12 for zero scalar curvature . in refs .",
    "@xcite , to investigate the qcd nature of dark energy , it is realized that if our universe is embedded on a nontrivial finite manifold , such as a torus , the energy density should be proportional to the deviation from the minkowski space - time . in this model",
    ", the topological susceptibility @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the topological charge density and @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the conventional qcd gluon fields and @xmath18 . although @xmath19 is a total derivative , the standard witten - veneziano solution of @xmath7 problem implies that @xmath13 does not vanish .",
    "this causes an unphysical pole at zero momentum in the correlation function of @xmath20 .",
    "using @xmath21 ; with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the decay constant and the polarization vector , respectively ; as well as @xmath24 , one can write @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the propagator of ghost field and the minus sign is considered to solve the @xmath7 problem @xcite . by introducing a single light quark with mass @xmath27 and the matrix element of the @xmath11 field via @xmath28 one",
    "gets @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass squared of the physical @xmath11 field . on the other hand ,",
    "the relevant ward identity for qcd with light quarks @xmath31 is satisfied . by using these relations and @xmath32 , the famous witten - veneziano relation , @xmath33 ,",
    "is obtained .",
    "the deviation mentioned above is related to the finite size ( l ) of the manifold and @xmath34 .",
    "the topological susceptibility is related to the energy density through @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the angle of qcd .",
    "the corrections due to very large but finite size of the manifold are small .",
    "it is important to mention that if one knows the @xmath36 dependence of vacuum energy , one can compute the energy mismatch that arises in theory between the infinite minkowski and finite compact space - times .",
    "this effect is entirely due to the ghost and only much smaller corrections arise from all other qcd fields . from - , one can write ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath37=-\\delta \\chi = \\delta \\left(\\frac{m_0 ^ 2 \\lambda_{ym}^2 } { m_{\\eta^{\\prime}}^2 } \\right ) \\simeq -c \\frac{2h}{m_{\\eta{\\prime } } }   \\left(\\frac{m_0 ^ 2 \\lambda_{ym}^2 } { m_{\\eta^{\\prime}}^2 } \\right)\\simeq",
    "-c \\frac{2n_fh}{m_{\\eta{\\prime}}}\\mid m_q \\langle \\bar{q}q \\rangle\\mid < 0 . \\label{final}\\ ] ]",
    "the @xmath36 dependence of vacuum energy at @xmath38 and for @xmath39 quark flavors with equal mass is given as @xmath40 in ref .",
    "@xcite , such that @xmath41 .",
    "note that all contributions from the gluon condensates and condensates from the higgs field and etc .",
    ", cancel out in the subtraction as they appear with equal magnitude . from one can write @xmath42    this energy density in an expanding background , the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time , is analyzed in ref",
    "the global topology could be a torus and frw metric still locally describes the space - time .",
    "the universe may have a non - trivial topology and there are different searches on this , such as the matched circle test .",
    "it must be mentioned that these searches yield no detection of a compact topology @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , urban and zhitnitsky use the qcd vacuum energy in frw space - time to calculate some cosmological parameters and compare the model predictions with those of the @xmath2cdm and cosmological observations . in the calculations",
    ", they consider the qcd parameters at zero temperature ( late time ) to investigate the evolutions of eos parameter of dark energy and hubble parameter at low redshifts . in the present study , we extend those calculations by considering the qcd parameters at finite temperature . by increasing the temperature we can go from late time to the early universe and look for the variations of qcd vacuum , and as a result , variations of the cosmological parameters with respect to time ( temperature ) .",
    "in particular , we use the temperature dependent @xmath43 and @xmath44 to investigate the ghost energy density parameter ( @xmath45 ) , eos parameter of ghost dark energy ( @xmath46 ) , total eos parameter ( @xmath47 ) , hubble ( @xmath48 ) , and deceleration ( @xmath49 ) parameters as a function of e - folding n and redshift z. the results are compared with those of zero temperature existing in the literature as well as the @xmath2cdm .    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we present some details of the model at finite temperature and its modifications on the energy conservation in the following section . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the cosmological parameters and their time evolution .",
    "the last section is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "as previously discussed , the energy density of qcd ghost field , @xmath50 , can be related to the hubble parameter at late time as @xmath51 with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the light quark condensate at zero temperature , @xmath54 is the average light quark mass ( up and down ) , @xmath55 @xcite is the mass of @xmath11 meson at vacuum , @xmath56 is the speed of light , @xmath57 is today s value of the hubble parameter ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 denotes the number of flavors .",
    "we use the natural units @xmath60 .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is constant at zero temperature . by setting @xmath62 and putting all other values ,",
    "the energy density of qcd ghost field is found as @xmath63 which leads to a consistent prediction with the observations at late time . to investigate the dependence of @xmath64 on temperature , we need to know the dependence of the quark condensate @xmath65 and @xmath66 on temperature . in the present study ,",
    "we use the parametrization for the behavior of the quark condensate in terms of the temperature given in ref .",
    "@xcite which can be fitted to the following function : @xmath67 this parametrization reproduces the lattice qcd predictions on the temperature - dependent light quark condensates @xcite .    the behavior of @xmath11 meson mass with respect to temperature is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be parametrized in terms of temperature as @xmath68 where we took the critical temperature @xmath69 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using the above parametrizations",
    ", we plot the dependence of the quark condensate , @xmath43 , and @xmath70 in terms of temperature up to @xmath71 in figure 1 . from this figure",
    "we see that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constant up to some temperatures after which they start to diminish , drastically .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 also remains unchanged up to roughly @xmath72 , after which it immediately falls to zero .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the variation of hubble parameter ( left panel ) and its zoomed version ( right panel ) in terms of n / z are depicted in figure [ fig : mathubble ] . for comparison , in the same figure",
    ", we also show the variation of hubble parameter in @xmath2cdm model as well as the variation of this parameter obtained at constant @xmath64 by ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath73 we also add the most recent data @xcite to figure [ fig : mathubble ] .    from this figure , we see that our model s prediction ( @xmath74 ) on variation of @xmath48 is very close to that of the @xmath2cdm model and very well fits to the observational data .",
    "the behavior of @xmath48 versus @xmath75 for @xmath76 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite given in the interval @xmath77 considerably differs from the others in the interval @xmath78 , although it predicts the same @xmath48 with other models and observational data at @xmath79 . from this figure",
    ", we also see that , when going from the late to early time , the hubble parameter drastically increases in terms of e - folding .",
    "another cosmological parameter is the deceleration parameter , defined as @xmath80 the deceleration parameter @xmath49 versus n / z for late time is depicted in figure [ fig : matq ] .        from this figure",
    ", we read that the behavior of @xmath49 with respect to @xmath75 at late time shows roughly good consistency with the predictions of @xmath2cdm .",
    "it is well known that the transition from positive to negative values of @xmath49 refers to the transition from deceleration to the present acceleration in expansion .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig : matq ] , in the @xmath2cdm model , this transition occurs at @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , while in our model , the acceleration starts a bit later at nearly @xmath83 .",
    "the ghost dark energy model proposed by urban and zhitnitsky @xcite at zero temperature gives the energy density compatible with the cosmological observations at late time .",
    "we extended their model from late to early periods of the universe and searched for the variations of some cosmological observables in terms of temperature by considering the temperature - dependent qcd parameters .",
    "we discussed the variations of the energy density parameter of ghost dark energy , the eos parameters of the ghost and total fluid , the hubble and deceleration parameters with respect to n / z .",
    "it has been found that the ghost dark energy plays no role at early universe and it is produced after @xmath84 .",
    "the lack of ghost dark energy before @xmath84 is in agreement with the predictions of the standard big bang on the decelerated expansionary phases ( matter and radiation dominated eras ) .",
    "our prediction on @xmath45 is in a good consistency with the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite existing in the interval @xmath85 for constant @xmath64 and non - interacting case .",
    "the model predicts the eos parameter of ghost dark energy to be @xmath86 near to the critical temperature , although it drastically increases to @xmath87 referring to the behavior as a cosmic string in the presence of radiation .",
    "it remains unchanged up to the radiation matter equality . in this interval",
    ", the total eos parameter of the fluid shows that the qcd ghost is dominated by the radiation and the predictions stay consistent with the bbn s and so with the values for the abundance of light elements . after radiation matter equality , the ghost field eos parameter becomes roughly @xmath88 in the presence of matter and remains unchanged up to @xmath89 , after which it evolves to @xmath1 for late time . after radiation - matter equality ,",
    "the total eos parameter becomes zero representing the deceleration in expansion up to @xmath90 , after which it starts to drop to @xmath1 referring to late time accelerated expansion .",
    "the transition from the deceleration to acceleration in expansion happens a bit later in our model compared to the @xmath2cdm .",
    "the late time predictions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 are in good agreement with those of ref .",
    "@xcite for constant @xmath64 and non - interacting case .    in the case of hubble parameter ,",
    "our prediction is consistent with that of the @xmath2cdm and better fits to the recent observational data at late time compared to the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite for constant @xmath64 existing in the interval @xmath78 .",
    "all models have the same predictions at @xmath79 .    for the deceleration parameter",
    ", our model predicts that the change in sign of this parameter ( transition from the decelerated expansionary to the accelerated expansionary phase ) occurs a bit later than that of the @xmath2cdm model although these models have roughly the same predictions on the behavior of @xmath49 with respect to @xmath75 at late time .",
    "the obtained results at finite temperature in the present work point out that the qcd ghost vacuum can be still a valid candidate to dark energy .",
    "interestingly , this dark energy source has a dynamical equation of state parameter equal to @xmath0 at the early universe and @xmath1 today , behaving similar to the cosmological constant at late time .",
    "this dynamical property of eos parameter can be checked by fitting to observations .",
