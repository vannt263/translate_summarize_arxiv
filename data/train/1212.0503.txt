    "generally , the  observed radio spectra of  most pulsars can be modelled as a  power law with  negative spectral indices of  about  -1.8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if a  pulsar can be observed at  frequencies low enough ( i.e.  ) , it may also show a  low - frequency turnover in  its spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "on the  other hand , lorimer  ( 1995 ) mentioned three pulsars which have positive spectral indices in  the  frequency range 300 - 1600  mhz .",
    "later , maron  ( 2000 ) re - examined spectra of  these pulsars taking into account the  data obtained at  higher frequencies ( above  1.6  ghz ) and  consequently were the  first to demonstrate a  possible existence of  spectra with  turnover at  high frequencies , about 1  ghz .",
    "kijak  ( 2011a ) provided a  definite evidence for  a  new type of  pulsar radio spectra .",
    "these spectra show the  maximum flux above 1  ghz , while at  higher frequencies the  spectra look like a  typical pulsar spectrum . at lower frequencies ( below 1  ghz ) ,",
    "the  observed flux decreases , showing a positive spectral index ( @xcite ) .",
    "they called these objects the  gigahertz - peaked spectra ( gps ) pulsars .",
    "a  frequency at  which such a  spectrum shows the  maximum flux was called the  peak frequency .",
    "kijak  et  al .",
    "( 2011a ) also indicated that  the  gps pulsars are relatively young objects , and  they usually adjoin such interesting environments as hii regions or compact pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "additionally , some of  them seem to  be coincident with  the  known but sometimes unidentified x - ray sources from third egret catalogue or hess observations .",
    "we can assume that  the  gps appearance owes to the environmental conditions around the  neutron stars rather than to the  radio emission mechanism .",
    "psr  b1259 - 63 was also listed by  lorimer  ( 1995 ) as a pulsar with  positive spectral index .",
    "therefore , it seems a natural candidate to  be classified as the  gps pulsar .",
    "this pulsar is in an unique binary with a  massive main - sequence be star . has a  short period of  48 ms and  a  characteristic age of  330  kyr .",
    "its average dispersion measure  ( dm ) is  about 147  pc  @xmath0 and  the  corresponding distance is about 2.75 kpc .",
    "the companion star ls  2883 is a  10-mag massive be star with  a  mass of about 10m@xmath1 and  a  radius of  6r@xmath1 .",
    "be stars are generally believed to  have a  hot tenuous polar wind and  a  cooler high - density equatorial disc .",
    "the  psr  b1259 - 63/ls  2883 emits unpulsed non - thermal emission over a  wide range of  frequencies ranging between radio and  @xmath2rays , and  its flux varies with  orbital phase .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the  flux at  the  given frequency apparently changes with  orbital phases .",
    "when the  pulsar is close to  periastron , the  flux generally decreases at  all observed frequencies and  the  most drastic decrease is observed at  the  lowest frequency .",
    "moreover , we noticed all types of radio pulsar spectra .    psr  b1259 - 63 is a object with relatively high dispersion measure which means that its transition frequency is very high",
    "this implies that we definitely have to take into consideration both refractive ( riss ) and diffractive ( diss ) scintillations when analysing spectra for a given day .",
    "we used diffractive bandwidth @xmath3 and timescale @xmath4 from scintillation observations of the pulsar made far from periastron at 4.8 ghz and 8.4 ghz ( @xcite ) to estimate values of these parameters at 1.4 ghz and 2.4 ghz assuming @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote frequency and distance respectively .",
    "we estimated the values of @xmath4 to be ranging from 40  s at 1.4  ghz to 360  s at 8.4  ghz which suggests that diffractive scintillations should not affect the average flux measurements ( observing sessions was usually 4 hours long ) .",
    "roughly estimated refractive timescales vary from 12  hours at  8.4  ghz to more than 20  days at  1.4  ghz . however",
    ", for lower frequencies the modulation index is relatively small which means lower uncertainty estimates when measuring flux .",
    "high frequency observations will be affected by refractive scintillations what leads to conclusion that flux values should be averaged over epochs and/or orbital phase intervals to be more reliable .",
    "close to  the  periastron point the spectra of  b1259 - 63 resemble those of  the gps pulsars .",
    "the spectrum for the  orbital epochs further from the  periastron point are more consistent with  typical pulsar spectra ( i.e.  power - law and  broken ) . moreover , detailed study of  psr  b1259 - 63 spectra revealed the  appearance of  all  types of  spectral shapes , including a  flat spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ detailed ] ) .",
    "we believe that the case of  b1259 - 63 can be treated as  a  key factor to  our understanding of  not only the  gps phenomenon ( observed for the solitary pulsars with  interesting environments ) but also other types of  untypical spectra as  well ( e.g.  flat or  broken spectra ) .",
    "this in turn would suggest , that the  appearance of  various non - standard spectra shapes in  the  general population of  pulsars can be caused by  peculiar environmental conditions .",
