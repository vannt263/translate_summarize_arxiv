    "the search for efficient , high - power , inexpensive , compact , and room - temperature methods of generation of coherent teraherz ( thz ) radiation is one of the main topics in modern optoelectronics and photonics  @xcite .",
    "its importance is based on the fact that thz radiation has unique potential for a wide range of applications from diagnostics of different materials ( including semiconductors , chemical compounds , biomolecules , and biotissues ) , imaging ( for medical and security purposes ) , to remote atmospheric sensing and monitoring , astronomy , etc .  @xcite .    in previous works",
    "we have focussed on a new approach to the problem of generation of short coherent thz pulsed radiation by taking advantage of dramatic enhancement of the nonlinear response of a medium via maximal quantum coherence @xcite , created in atomic and molecular gases with different level configurations ( double-@xmath1 , v-@xmath1 , double - v schemes ) by coherent laser radiaiton .    as is well - known , quantum coherence can dramatically change the optical properties of media .",
    "for example , lasing without population inversion ( lwi )  @xcite and electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite have been demonstrated @xcite in coherently driven media .",
    "these unusual properties are employed for generation of electromagnetic radiation of different frequencies ranging from ir  @xcite to uv  @xcite , and gamma - rays  @xcite .",
    "enhancement of coherent raman scattering via maximal coherence has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite , and it has applications to enhanced real time spectroscopy ( fast cars )  @xcite .",
    "previously , the double @xmath1 scheme with near - maximal raman coherence was used for highly efficient conversion of blue to ultraviolet light in @xmath2 vapor @xcite .",
    "a new type of gas - phase optical parametric oscillator @xcite was suggested for frequency downconversion to generate 1.88 @xmath3 m radiation in pb vapor , and efficient infrared upconversion @xcite was suggested to convert infrared light with a 100 @xmath3 m wavelength to the visible .",
    "the first experimental demonstration supporting these ideas was performed in @xcite where 5 @xmath3 m ir radiaiton was generated in @xmath4 atomic vapor .",
    "many results in this area have been obtained in gases , but , recently , eit has been generalized and extended to solids with a long - lived spin coherence @xcite , a class of solid materials , namely , rare - earth and transition metal ion doped dielectrics have been suggested as very attractive from the point of view of realization and applications of eit .",
    "several applications of eit to improve performance of solid state lasers have been already proposed @xcite .",
    "lwi , first realized in a gas medium @xcite , recently has been demonstrated in solids as well @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the approach of generation of thz radiation via resonantly induced coherence to solid state media .",
    "the coherence at the corresponding transition can be induced by coherent optical fields as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruby - levels ] .",
    "electronic levels of the thz transition are coupled by a pair of optical fields with rabi frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 to a common ground state forming a v system of energy levels .",
    "coherence @xmath7 induced by the optical fields at the thz transition gives rise to polarization provided that the corresponding dipole moment is not zero , which will radiate out a thz pulse with rabi frequency @xmath8 .",
    "this method differs from the one proposed in @xcite for gaseous media where the optically prepared thz coherence produces no macroscopic polarization of gaseous media at a thz transition ( this is the manifestation of symmetry with respect to inversion ) , the reason is that an electrically allowed dipole moment at the two - photon transition is zero since it is typically forbidden ( although , it is important to note here that the magnetic dipole moment can be non - zero even in gases , we discuss this opportunity later ) . for doped solids having sites with no inversion symmetry is common , such as the one occupied by cr@xmath9 ( simplified energy level structure is shown in fig.([fig : ruby - levels]a ) ) in ruby , the corresponding two - photon transition dipole moment is not zero , resulting in all three transitions in the @xmath0 scheme being allowed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that using nonlinear optical mixing in a semiconductor heterostructure for generation of few - cycle thz pulses was proposed in @xcite .",
    "in ruby closely spaced r@xmath10 and r@xmath11 lines arise from transitions between the ground state of the cr@xmath9 ion ( @xmath12a@xmath11 ) and its first excited state ( @xmath13e ) .",
    "each of these cubic - field states is split by the trigonal crystal field and spin - orbit coupling into a pair of kramers doublets , 0.38 @xmath14 apart in the ground state and 29.14 @xmath14 apart in the @xmath13e state .",
    "the width of the r lines is about 11 @xmath14 at room temperature and @xmath15 @xmath14 at the temperature of liquid nitrogen .",
    "the transitions from the @xmath12a@xmath11 ground state to levels @xmath13e are spin - forbidden , and have oscillator strength @xmath16 ( r@xmath10 , r@xmath11 line peak cross - section is @xmath17 cm@xmath13 at the temperature of liquid nitrogen and @xmath19 cm@xmath13 at room temperature ) .",
    "they are predominantly electric - dipole in nature , since the inversion symmetry of a cubic crystal field is broken by crystal field trigonal distortions and odd - parity lattice vibrations .",
    "namely , the odd - parity component of the crystal field at the cr@xmath9 ion mixes odd - parity states of high energy into the even parity d states between which r - transitions are observed and makes them weakly allowed . the magnetic - dipole contribution to the r - lines",
    "is estimated to be @xmath20 of the strength of the elecric - dipole transitions @xcite .",
    "the 29 @xmath14 transition in ruby has history which is as rich as the ruby laser itself .",
    "it was considered promising for realization of a quantum counter for far - infrared radiation ( fir ) @xcite on one hand , and as a system very convenient to study interaction processes of non - equilibrium phonons with two - level electronic systems ( so - called phonon spectrometer ) , on the other @xcite .",
    "there was also a proposal to make a far - infrared laser at this transition pumping via the r@xmath11 line , but due to the unfavorable ratio of relaxation rates ( fast relaxation at the fir and slow at the optical r@xmath10 transition ) , the laser could operate only at liquid helium temperature and the estimated gain did not exceed losses @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that 29 @xmath14 fir was produced by non - linear mixing of two ruby laser beams , one emitting at r@xmath10 and another at r@xmath11 , in linbo@xmath21 @xcite and in znte crystals @xcite , with the efficiency @xmath22 .",
    "the method proposed in the present work would allow pulsed thz radiation to be easily produced from a dual - color ruby laser itself , operating at both r@xmath10 and r@xmath11 lines , thus significantly miniaturizing the system .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in the next section we describe a theoretical model used to calculate parameters of generated thz pulses . in section iii",
    "we consider possibilities of phase - matching for fields in different regimes ( cw and short pulses ) . in section",
    "iv we make estimates showing the perspective of the suggested scheme as well as discuss a proposed experiment with a standard femto - second laser setup .",
    "next we show that the system we have considered is not limited , i.e. there are many systems to which our theory can be applied .",
    "finally we compare the efficiency of our scheme with the methods of generation of thz radiation used nowadays and possible applications that are opened due to the high efficiency of the proposed technique .",
    "the ruby system shown in fig.([fig : ruby - levels]a ) includes eight states , four in the ground @xmath23 and four in the excited @xmath24 one . in our theoretical analysis",
    "we describe it using only three levels as in fig.([fig : ruby - levels]b ) , since this simple model takes into account all essential physics and allows us to make estimates of expected thz radiation characteristics and required optical field parameters .    for the proposed technique to work",
    "we need to make sure that an efficient @xmath0 scheme can be realized . in the case of a single fs pulse ,",
    "driving both optical transitions simultaneously , we will have only one polarization , for example , linear . for two pulses we can choose each pulse polarization separately .",
    "selection rules for the right circular and left circular polarizations are shown in fig.([fig : sel - rules]a ) @xcite .",
    "as one can see , neither for the right , nor for the left circular polarization a @xmath0 scheme involving r@xmath10 and r@xmath11 transitions can be organized . for a linear polarization perpendicular to the optic axis , which is an equal sum or difference of the right and left ones , there are four @xmath0 schemes possible , shown in fig.([fig : sel - rules]b ) .",
    "taking into account the relation between the coefficients c@xmath25 and c@xmath26 : @xmath27 , one can see that the schemes a and c cancel each other , since the products of the matrix elements are opposite ( @xmath28 for a and c , respectively ) . on the other hand , for schemes b and d",
    "the products are the same ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these two @xmath0 schemes will interfere constructively and induce the thz coherence .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the system shown in fig.([fig : ruby - levels]b ) is given by @xmath30\\ ] ] @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the rabi frequency of the respective field , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the electric dipole matrix elements of the optical transitions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 of the thz transition @xmath40 , respectively ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the frequencies of the electronic and thz transitions ; @xmath44 is the amplitude of the respective electromagnetic field .",
    "the time - dependent density matrix equations are @xmath45-\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma \\rho + \\rho \\gamma),\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the relaxation matrix , and @xmath47 is the total hamiltonian .    to estimate the efficiency of thz radiation generation and required laser field intensities we first consider the system ( [ eq : den - matr ] ) in the limit of ultrashort pulses , which are short compared to relaxation times of the system , and neglect propagation effects for the optical fields .",
    "in this simplified picture we assume that the system is driven by two resonant fields with equal time - dependent rabi - frequencies @xmath48 ( assumed real ) . in the case of a v - scheme considered in this work",
    "the stirap technique , proposed in @xcite for maximal molecular coherence excitation in a @xmath1 energy system , is not applicable . in the case of the v scheme maximal coherence",
    "is excited by two fields of equal rabi frequency and duration , acting simultaneouly .",
    "the system is then described by the following set of equations @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 due to the symmetry of the model system @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 - real .",
    "let us introduce new variables @xmath58 @xmath59 for which , taking into account ( [ eq : sigcb ] ) and ( [ eq : rhoaa ] ) , the following relation can be obtained @xmath60 giving @xmath61 . for the new variables we arrive at the following system of equations @xmath62 @xmath63 which can be further simplified",
    "if we substitute @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 the solution of this system is @xmath67 @xmath68 it follows from eq.([eq : beta - sol ] ) that maximal coherence @xmath69 will be excited by a pair of pulses with area @xmath70 each .",
    "taking pulses of a gaussian shape @xmath71 with the area of the pulse @xmath72 , we will have the maximal coherence excited when @xmath73 .",
    "the excited coherence will give rise to the polarization which will radiate out a coherent thz pulse .",
    "it is worth noting that this mechanism is similar to free - induction decay ( fid ) @xcite in photon echo : excitation of a maximal coherence in a two - level system by a @xmath74 pulse , followed by emission of a coherent pulse .",
    "the difference is that typically in solids the fid decay is governed by the dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening of the transition leading to decay of the corresponding coherence during the time @xmath75 . in the case of ruby",
    "the thz transition is homogeneously broadened even at liquid helium temperature , so the decay of the thz coherence is determined by the homogeneous width of the corresponding transition .    for two long pulses , which can be considered as cw ( in the sense that optical and thz coherences approach the steady - state ) , with approximately equal rabi frequencies @xmath76 , resonant with the corresponding optical transitions",
    ", we get the thz coherence @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the optical and thz coherence decay rates , respectively . in this case",
    "the maximal thz coherence @xmath80 will be excited provided that @xmath81 , which is a usual steady - state eit threshold condition .",
    "let us now estimate the peak intensity and energy of the optical pulses necessary to excite required coherence .",
    "the peak intensity of the pulse is expressed in terms of the peak rabi - frequency as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the width of an optical transition , @xmath84 is the refractive index at the optical wavelength , @xmath85 is the optical wavelength , and @xmath86 is the corresponding absorption cross - section . the energy of a single pulse can be calculated as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the laser beam cross - section .",
    "a complete self - consistent calculation also includes field propagation equations @xmath89 where index @xmath90 indicates all fields and corresponding polarizations , @xmath91 is the corresponding coupling constant , @xmath92 are the frequencies of the optical and thz fields , @xmath93 is the density of the medium , @xmath94 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath95 is the corresponding refractive index , and @xmath96 are losses for the field during propagation in the crystal due to scattering , diffraction , or non - resonant absorption . for optical fields these losses",
    "are usually small , but for the thz field in free space the diffraction losses given by @xmath97 should be taken into account . to avoid diffraction losses",
    "the crystal can be placed in a waveguide for thz radiation , then the distribution of the field mode should be taken into account .",
    "propagation effects are important for nonlinear interactions such as wave mixing .",
    "let us consider two regimes : cw , when the spectral widths of pulses is smaller than the splitting between the levels of the thz transition , and pulsed one , when the spectral width of pulses exceeds the splitting between the levels .    in the cw regime",
    "the field @xmath8 at the output of the crystal is given by ( assuming that the thz pulse propagates in @xmath98 direction ) @xmath99 @xmath100 if losses are neglected .",
    "here @xmath101 is the length of the crystal , and the prefactor describes phase - matching ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the direction of thz propagation is given by the phase - matching condition ( see fig.3 ) @xmath103 to satisfy the phase - matching condition @xmath104 for the thz pulse to propagate in @xmath98 direction ( along the crystal ) the angle between the optical fields has to be adjusted according to the equantion @xmath105 rewriting a condition for optical and thz frequencies @xmath106 in the form of @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the wavelength of the optical ( thz ) field . for the case of ruby the refractive index for thz radiation is twice larger than the one for optics , @xmath110 @xcite , then the angle between directions of propagation for optical fields @xmath111 .",
    "the angle between the @xmath112 vectors and the thz field propagation direction is @xmath113 in this case .",
    "this provides an interesting opportunity to design a dual - wavelength ruby laser working simultaneously at @xmath114 and @xmath115 lines that can also generate thz radiation , as is shown in fig.[fig : phase - matching]c .",
    "the crystal will simultaneously serve as a thz waveguide in this case .",
    "now we turn to a short pulse excitation regime . for many femtosecond laser experimental setups",
    "it would be an interesting extension to include an option of thz generation . the phase - matching in this case",
    "can be obtained by excitation of thz coherence with two optical beams with the same frequencies but different directions of propagation .",
    "it is instructive to show how it works in this case .",
    "let us consider the problem in the simplest case of lowest order of perturbation in coherent pumping fields .",
    "the density matrix equations look like @xmath116 @xmath117    @xmath118    a solution of this set of equations is given by    @xmath119    one can see that the phase - matching between the optical fields and the thz field is achieved by appropriate tilting of the optical beams at the angle @xmath120 ; in particularly , for ruby @xmath121 .",

    "it is important to note that the proposed technique can be applied to other solid materials with suitable transitions in the thz range .",
    "similar schemes can be found in other ions as well , since for a typical rare - earth or transition metal ion the level structure is complex , having many crystal field and spin - orbit split components , separated by tens to hundreds of wave numbers .",

    "it allows one to decrease peak optical intensities to induce maximal thz coherence and results in higher convertion efficiency .",
    "the technique can also be applied to rare - earth ion doped materials , for example pr@xmath9 doped hosts , such as laf@xmath21 @xcite , y@xmath11sio@xmath218 @xcite ,",
    "caf@xmath11 @xcite with the ground and excited state stark splittings being in a broad range 17 - 100 @xmath14 and higher , the same splittings are found in nd@xmath9 doped crystals , such as yag @xcite and yvo@xmath215 @xcite , and a number of others , for example tm : yag @xcite and er : yag @xcite and er : ylif@xmath215 @xcite .",
    "also it is important to note that the technique can be applied to gases as well , but the coupling to thz radiation in this case occurs by a magnetic - dipole moment ( macroscopic polarization due to an electric - dipole moment is zero because of symmetry reasons ) . typically the magnetic dipole moment is smaller than the electric dipole one , so efficiency is smaller , but for higher densities and pressures this approach can still produce thz radiation .",
    "the dipole moments for optical transitions can be stronger than for ruby , so the coherence can be larger .",
    "this possibility is an extension of the method proposed in @xcite , although its analysis is beyond of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the next important remark is related to the case when the thz transition of interest belongs to the ground state .",
    "then there are a lot of new opportunities to use more sophisticated methods of coherence preparation .",
    "in particular , the method of pulsed coherence production via stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite can be used to control the duration of the thz pulse similarly to @xcite .",
    "generally , all methods for coherence preparation via femtosecond pulse shaping developed to improve the sensitivity of coherent raman scattering @xcite , in particular , frequency chirping@xcite and fractional stirap  @xcite , matched pulses  @xcite , etc . can be applied .",
    "it is interesting to compare the method of thz generation proposed in recent works @xcite and in this paper with currently available ones .",
    "there are a variety of methods already considered successful for generation of short thz pulses , so it is worth to compare the above estimates with the currently achieved parameters .    at the moment",
    "the most impressive results in generation of short thz pulses were achieved using electron beam based sources , free - electron lasers ( fel ) @xcite and synchrotrons @xcite . for fels ,",
    "typically thz pulses of about 1 ps duration with 1 - 40 ns distance between micropulses are generated , grouped into a few-@xmath219s trains .",
    "energies of the micropulses are about 1 - 50 mj ( the parameters of felbe laser , rossendorf , germany ) .",
    "recently , substantially higher powers of coherent broadband thz pulses , produced by synchrotron emission , were obtained from the electron beamline @xcite .",
    "hundreds of fs - short half - cycle thz pulses were generated with energies up to 100 @xmath219j .",
    "thz pulses with ns durations were achieved in thz semiconductor lasers ( quantum cascade lasers , p - ge and n - si lasers @xcite-@xcite ) , limited by the need of cryogenic cooling and in the case of p - ge lasers by high electric and magnetic fields required for laser operation . in p - ge lasers",
    "@xcite-@xcite 20 ps pulse durations were obtained in a mode - locked regime with peak power up to several watts in a few-@xmath219s train of pulses .    the obvious advantages of the optical crystal based thz emitters discussed in this work over fel and synchrotron sources are compactness ( typical optical solid - state materials are significantly smaller ) , cost , and ease of handling .",
    "compared to thz qc lasers the crystals are much easier to grow and handle , they also can provide better coupling between the thz mode and the generating material due to a larger size of crystals .",
    "other methods of short thz pulse generation are based on interaction of different materials with ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "the most popular ones , giving subpicosecond thz pulses , are the photocurrent method using the auston - switch technique @xcite and the optical rectification technique @xcite .",
    "since the proposed crystal - based thz sources are closer in their characteristics to these methods , we will make a more detailed comparison .",
    "recently thz sources based on amlifier - laser systems such as ti : sapphire , utilizing different methods of thz radiation generation such as optical rectification in nonlinear crystals and laser - produced plasma and photocurrent thz generation in semiconductor antennas , became popular .",
    "the transition metal and rare - earth ion doped crystals proposed in this work as thz emitters are suitable for amplifier - laser - based thz systems working in a single - shot regime @xcite , since the typically long ( hundreds @xmath219s - milliseconds ) population decay time of excited states of these ions limits the repetion rate .",
    "crystals are also better in terms of saturation , able to withstand high laser pulse fluence and thus very compatible with low - repetiotion rate table - top laser systems producing pulses with energies in the 10 - 100 mj range with @xmath220 hz repetion rates .",
    "fig.[fig : comp-1 ] compares the predicted in @xcite performance of different amplifier - laser - based thz sources and ruby at room temperature , at optical pulses energy of @xmath220 mj .",
    "it shows that ruby is expected to perform as good as the biased gaas antenna with 1 kv / cm dc bias field and the plasma thz source with an external bias field , slightly yielding them in conversion efficiency .",
    "fig.[fig : comp-2 ] compares the predicted in @xcite performance of different amplifier - laser - based thz sources at room temperature and ruby at liquid helium one , at optical pulses energy of @xmath221 mj .",
    "the ruby source at liquid helium temperature can compete with the the plasma source utilizing the fundumental and second harmonic optical fields in terms of thz pulse energy and conversion efficiency , and yields it in peak thz field amplitude .",
    "new methods of thz generation proposed in @xcite for atomic and molecular gases and in the present work for doped crystals potentially have very high efficiency , they offer the possibility of thz pulses with controlled durations including femtosecond region and the possibility of generation of pulses with high energy , already comparable with synchrotron or free - electron laser based thz sources .",
    "implementation of the method , therefore , will open exciting opportunities in many fields of thz applications such as the time - resolved thz spectroscopy . using intense short pulses of thz radiation generated by the proposed method will significantly increase the performance of spectroscopic measurements , allowing maximal ( among currently existing methods ) temporal resolution .",
    "extremely high efficiency of the proposed technique opens a way for orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity of the spectroscopic methods , thz tomography , non - destructive quality control , medical diagnostics and biomaterial characterization .",
    "another advantage of the proposed scheme is a better control over the phase of the generated thz radiation , resulting in lower ( pulse duration @xmath176 bandwidth ) product compared to the non - coherent techniques .",
    "resulting thz pulses have narrower bandwidth , thus offering an opportunity of better resolution measurements .",
    "coherence of the generated thz pulses combined with their high energy opens the way to various non - linear phenomena in the thz range , as well as to coherent phenomena similar to the ones observed with lasers in the visible range , such as rabi oscillations , coherent transients , etc .",
    "the proposed methods have , therefore , high potential for investigation of nonlinear effects in chemical and biological objects , in medical applications , which is a substantial , practically unexplored field of research .",
    "in the present work we proposed a new technique for generation of short intense thz pulses in coherently driven doped optical crystals . the method is based on excitation of maximal thz coherence by a pair of resonant optical pulses , resulting in polarization build - up in the medium , which will radiate a thz pulse . as an example , a well - known laser material cr@xmath9:al@xmath11o@xmath21 ( ruby ) is considered and numerical estimates of expected thz and required optical field parameters are given . a number of other doped crystals , having transitions in the thz range , are suggested .",
    "comparison is made with the existing methods of short thz pulses generation .    in summary ,",
    "the optical crystal based thz sources proposed in this work can potentially produce short high energy ( hundreds pj - tens @xmath219j ) thz pulses with durations ranging from 1 ps up to several ns",
    ". the generated thz radiation will be coherent , thus offering the possibility of coherent interaction between the thz pulses and probed media .",
    "this allows one to study various types of nonlinear penomena .",
    "obvious advantages of crystals are their compact size , ease of growth and handling , robustness and low cost .",
