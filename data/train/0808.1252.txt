    "elastic electron - nucleus scattering has been for many years a very useful tool to investigate the size and shape of stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "electrons interact with nuclei basically through the electromagnetic force .",
    "if the energy of the electrons is high enough , they become a relatively clean probe to explore precisely the internal structure of nuclei , insensitive to strong interaction effects . in particular , the analysis of electron scattering data provides most valuable information about the charge distribution in atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "developments in accelerator technology and detection techniques nowadays allow experimentation with nuclei beyond the limits of @xmath0-stability .",
    "the number of nuclei whose masses have been measured keeps growing @xcite and this tendency is expected to continue with the use of radioactive isotope beams ( rib ) @xcite .",
    "a new generation of electron - rib colliders using storage rings is now under construction in riken ( japan ) @xcite and gsi ( germany ) @xcite .",
    "these facilities will offer unprecedented opportunities to study the structure of exotic unstable nuclei through electron scattering in the elise experiment at fair in germany @xcite and the scrit project in japan @xcite .",
    "therefore , the theoretical investigation of exotic nuclei with models of purported reliability in stable isotopes is a timely and challenging problem .",
    "such effort will test the ability of the established nuclear theory in the domain of exotic nuclei , and may as well provide valuable references for future experiments .    in recent literature , several theoretical studies of elastic electron - nucleus scattering in exotic nuclei",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "some of these works are concerned with analyzing electron scattering in light nuclei , where exciting exotic phenomena such as the appearence of halos may take place . that is the case of e.g.  @xmath1he @xcite , @xmath2li @xcite , @xmath3b @xcite , @xmath4o and @xmath5s @xcite nuclei , where possible effects on scattering from the occurrence of halos have been investigated .",
    "light nuclei require a microscopic treatment of the scattering interaction to properly deal with the underlying shell model structure @xcite .",
    "other works study the variation of the charge form factors along isotopic @xcite and isotonic @xcite chains of medium and heavy mass nuclei .",
    "it has been found that , when the number of neutrons ( protons ) in these isotopic ( isotonic ) chains increases , the squared modulus of the charge form factor and the position of its minima show , respectively , an upward trend and a significant inward shifting in the momentum transfer .",
    "in addition to electron scattering , it is worth mentioning that proton scattering may be another valuable tool to investigate the changes in the charge density of the nucleus , especially at its interior , as one proceeds to the drip lines along isotopic chains  @xcite .    to investigate the internal structure of nuclear charge densities , the de broglie wavelength of the probe has to be of the order of 1 fm .",
    "this means that the energy of the electron beam has to be of the order of several hundred mev .",
    "therefore , for accurate theoretical calculations of differential cross sections ( dcs ) and electric charge form factors , one needs to solve the elastic scattering of dirac particles in the scalar potential pertaining to the nuclear charge distribution .",
    "the simplest approach is the plane - wave born approximation ( pwba ) , where one assumes that the initial and final states of the electron can be described by plane waves .",
    "although the pwba is able to account for important features of scattering , it is not enough accurate for quantitative calculations of the electric charge form factor .",
    "a more elaborate method is supplied by the glauber theory using a relativistic eikonal approximation of the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to a systematic study in elastic electron - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "the most sophisticated calculations of electron - nucleus scattering employ the exact phase - shift analysis of the dirac equation .",
    "this method corresponds to the so - called distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite and was employed e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we apply a modified version of the recently published code elsepa @xcite to the elastic electron - nucleus scattering problem .",
    "this code was originally devised to perform accurate dirac partial - wave calculations of elastic scattering of electrons and positrons by atoms , positive ions , and molecules in the low - energy domain .",
    "the main input needed for solving the elastic electron - nucleus scattering problem is the charge density of the target nucleus . in the present article we use charge densities obtained with mean field models for calculating electron scattering off medium and heavy mass nuclei . for this purpose",
    ", we employ effective nuclear interactions of current use in nuclear structure physics .",
    "it is known that the overall trends of the elastic electron - nucleus scattering in medium and heavy nuclei are , in general , reasonably reproduced by the theoretical charge densities obtained in the mean field approximation .",
    "however , different effective interactions predict electric charge form factors and dcs that differ in fine details and describe with different quality the experimental data . in our study we consider the non - relativistic skyrme forces skm@xmath6 @xcite and sly4 @xcite , and the covariant models nl3 @xcite , fsugold @xcite , g2 @xcite , and dd - me2 @xcite .",
    "they are representative examples of effective interactions that accurately describe the ground - state properties of finite nuclei and some of their collective excitations .",
    "the parameters of the alluded microscopic interactions have been determined from careful calibration to observables such as binding energies , single - particle levels , and charge and diffraction radii of a variety of selected nuclei .",
    "the nucleon density distributions of the skyrme hartree - fock and relativistic mean field theories are obtained by numerical solution of the quantal mean field variational equations .",
    "the effects of the neutrons on the proton density are taken into account , in a self - consistent manner , through the interaction terms of the effective force or lagrangian . therefore",
    ", no parametrized shapes of the density profiles are implemented .",
    "nevertheless , most of the mean field calculations of finite nuclei assume point - nucleon densities .",
    "the charge density is obtained from the proton point - like distribution folded with the proton charge form factor @xcite @xmath7 a value @xmath8 @xmath9 corresponds to a proton root mean square ( rms ) radius of 0.81 fm .",
    "this is the standard prescription in the fitting procedure of the parameters of most skyrme forces and relativistic mean field interactions to the experimental data of finite nuclei , including charge radii .",
    "the covariant models of ref.@xcite are an exception to this fact , and in particular the interaction g2 @xcite that we will employ in several of our calculations .",
    "the effective lagrangian of g2 incorporates the low - energy electromagnetic structure of the nucleon within the theory @xcite .",
    "it is to be emphasized that in g2 the charge density is obtained directly from the solution of the mean field equations and that there is no folding to be performed with external single - nucleon form factors , hereby maximizing the predictive power . in the other mean field forces considered in our work",
    "we will neglect the contribution of the neutron charge form factor @xcite to the charge density .",
    "this is known to be a reasonable approximation up to moderate momentum transfers @xcite , which is the region analyzed in the present study of scattering .",
    "moreover , it ensures consistency with the method applied originally to fit the parameters of these interactions ; additional modifications into the charge densities could spoil , e.g. , their accurate predictions for charge radii .",
    "it is to be mentioned that the mean field treatment would reach its limits in the study of exotic light nuclei , where the shell model structure and halos can become prevailing features @xcite .",
    "therefore we do not attempt to treat these light systems in the present work .",
    "the development of suitable tools and a unified framework to deal with charge densities and electron scattering in nuclei across the mass table remains an outstanding problem in the field , maybe appropriate for new initiatives like the unedf collaboration to build a universal nuclear energy density functional @xcite .",
    "the present article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the theoretical formalism .",
    "the mean field description of finite nuclei in the non - relativistic and relativistic frames is shortly discussed .",
    "the dirac partial - wave calculation of elastic scattering of electrons by nuclei implemented in the code elsepa is summarized . in section iii ,",
    "the elastic electron scattering results obtained from the charge densities of the above - mentioned effective interactions are studied by comparing with available experimental data for several stable nuclei . in section",
    "iv we investigate the theoretical predictions for elastic electron - nucleus scattering in the tin and calcium isotopic chains from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line .",
    "these calculations are performed with the relativistic mean field interaction g2 @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are laid in the final section .",
    "in the current section we review the basic features of the skyrme and relativistic mean field models that we will employ to compute the theoretical nuclear charge densities .",
    "we also summarize the calculation of dirac distorted waves for elastic electron - nucleus scattering in the code elsepa .",
    "the reader conversant with effective nuclear mean field models and with knowledge of the basics of dirac partial - wave calculations may prefer to proceed directly to the discussion of results that starts in section iii .",
    "the mean field approach assumes that nucleons move independently in a mean field generated by the other nucleons of the atomic nucleus .",
    "useful tools for mean field calculations of nuclei are the non - relativistic hartree - fock method with phenomenological interactions and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) hartree model with effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological forces and effective lagrangians usually depend on about ten adjustable parameters that are fitted to reproduce relevant ground - state properties , such as binding energies and charge radii of a few nuclei .",
    "a common trend of phenomenological interactions used in the mean field approach is their simple mathematical structure . in the non - relativistic mean field models , the skyrme interactions @xcite are among those most widely used .",
    "skyrme forces are zero - range interactions , which do not require calculations of exchange contributions .",
    "these forces have been employed for describing ground - state properties of the atomic nucleus , low - energy excited states , fission and fusion barriers , nucleon - nucleus and heavy - ion potentials , etc .",
    "( see e.g.  ref .",
    "the parameter set skm@xmath6 @xcite is the classical paradigm of such a model .",
    "it is known to yield charge densities in overall agreement with densities inferred from experiment @xcite .",
    "sly4 @xcite is a more modern version of the skyrme force that was calibrated with special care for the isospin sector and for predictions of neutron - rich matter that occurs e.g.  in neutron stars .",
    "the rmf theory of hadrons has become another useful tool for the study of bulk and single - particle properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei @xcite . in the relativistic model ,",
    "nucleons are treated as dirac particles that interact by exchanging virtual mesons .",
    "the covariant theory automatically takes into account the spin - orbit force , the finite - range , and the density - dependence of the nuclear interaction . the no - sea approximation , which disregards effects from the dirac sea of negative energy states ,",
    "is adopted .",
    "the open parameters of the model are the meson coupling constants and some of the meson masses . after fitting them to binding energies , charge radii , and other well - known empirical data of a few selected nuclei ,",
    "the covariant theory predicts average properties of spherical and deformed nuclei over the whole periodic table in very good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "the original walecka lagrangian @xcite contained @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 mesons without any meson self - interactions .",
    "it was able to predict the correct saturation point of nuclear matter , albeit with a very large incompressibility modulus .",
    "the model was refined with the introduction of sigma meson self - interactions @xcite .",
    "a parameterization of this type is e.g.  the celebrated nl3 model @xcite .",
    "these parameter sets properly describe the data about finite nuclei , but often display differences , at densities above the saturation point , with microscopic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations of the nuclear matter equation of state @xcite . a better agreement with the latter calculations at densities up to 23 times",
    "the saturation density is achieved by incorporating a quartic vector meson self - interaction in the effective lagrangian .",
    "another interesting addition is a mixed isoscalar - isovector coupling @xcite , which allows one to modulate the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the variation of this coupling leaves the binding energy and proton rms of a finite nucleus almost unaltered , but it considerably modifies the rms radius of the neutron distribution .",
    "a representative instance of this type of model is the fsugold parameter set @xcite .",
    "this set yields an equation of state that is considerably softer than in nl3 , for both symmetric matter and neutron matter . apart from the binding energies and charge radii of nuclei , fsugold delivers a satisfactory description of several modes of collective excitations having different neutron - to - proton ratios .",
    "the lagrangian density associated with the g2 parameter set is inspired by effective field theory methods .",
    "it contains all couplings consistent with the underlying qcd symmetries up to the order considered in the expansion scheme @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the majority of mean field models , g2 describes the low - energy electromagnetic structure of the nucleon within the theory by means of vector - meson dominance and derivative couplings to the photon , cf .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "as indicated above , this means that no additional calculations with external nucleon form factors are needed to obtain the charge density , and that the electromagnetic effects of the protons and neutrons are included within the low - energy regime in a unified framework @xcite . the g2 set explains finite nuclei and nuclear matter with a commendable level of accuracy .",
    "it predicts a soft equation of state both around saturation and at high densities that is consistent with recent measurements of kaon production and flow of matter in energetic heavy - ion collisions as well as with observations of masses and radii of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "recent formulations of the rmf theory do not introduce mesonic self - interactions but make the coupling constants of the mesons density dependent , like in the dd - me2 parameter set @xcite .",
    "these models accurately describe the properties of finite nuclei and , in addition , the associated equation of state of nuclear and neutron matter at supra - saturation agrees with the trends of microscopic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations that start from the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction .    pairing correlations need to be taken into account for the calculation of open - shell nuclei .",
    "we will describe them in both , non - relativistic and relativistic frames , through a modified bcs approach that takes into account the continuum by means of quasi - bound levels owing to their centrifugal ( neutrons ) or centrifugal - plus - coulomb barriers ( protons ) @xcite . for the skyrme models used in this work ,",
    "the pairing correlations are introduced by using a zero - range density - dependent force whose parameters can be found in ref .  @xcite . in the case of the covariant nl3 , g2 , and fsugold models ,",
    "we describe the pairing correlations by means of a constant matrix element fitted to reproduce the experimental binding energies of some selected isotopic and isotonic chains @xcite . in the dd - me2 parameter",
    "set a fixed gap is considered , determined from experimental odd - even mass differences  @xcite .",
    "the elsepa code @xcite was originally designed for the calculation of elastic scattering of electrons and positrons by atoms , positive ions , and molecules .",
    "we have adapted it to handle high - energy electron scattering by nuclei .",
    "elsepa computes the dcs using the conventional relativistic partial - wave method , which was first formulated by yennie et al .",
    "the projectile electron is assumed to feel the electrostatic field of the nuclear charge distribution .",
    "the potential energy of an electron at a distance @xmath13 from the center of the nucleus is given by v(r ) = - 4e ( _ 0^r _ ch ( r ) r^2 r .",

    "at the energies of interest for the electron - nucleus problem , the effect of screening by the orbiting atomic electrons is limited to scattering angles smaller than 1 degree ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which are well below the angular range covered by the electron - nucleus scattering measurements . consequently",
    ", electron screening is ignored in the present calculation . since the nuclear charge density is assumed to vanish beyond a certain radius @xmath15 ( i.e.  the radius of the box where the nuclear charge distribution is calculated ) ,",

    "the agreement with experiment deteriorates when the scattering angle increases , pointing out again some possible deficiencies in the inner region of the theoretical charge density distributions .    to make a more quantitative analysis of the electron scattering dcs derived from the mean field charge densities , we introduce a normalized square weighted difference ( @xmath52 ) , or comparison magnitude , with respect to the dcs measured in experiment . for each nucleus and electron beam energy ,",

    "valuable insights into the study of electron scattering often stem from consideration of modeled charge densities and electric charge form factors . moreover , these parameterized forms are instrumental in experimental data analyses .",

    "recalling eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , this correlation allows one to establish a straightforward relationship between @xmath99 and the helm parameter @xmath90 in the tin isotopic chain : @xmath104 we also find that the rms charge radii of the tin isotopes exhibit a considerable linear correlation with the momentum transfer @xmath99 , as depicted in the lower panel of fig .

    "if for guidance we consider the expression ( [ eq17 ] ) of the electric charge form factor in the adopted helm model , we see that the natural variables to investigate the variation of the charge form factor are @xmath79 and @xmath110 .",

    "therefore , the mass - number variation of @xmath109 is left as the principal source for the @xmath91-dependence of the value of the squared charge form factor at @xmath112 .",
    "it is then reasonable that the change with @xmath91 of @xmath113 and @xmath109 is correlated along the isotopic chain , a feature confirmed by fig.[fsqtin ] . as a physical insight , helped by eq .",

    "such experiments are envisaged at fair @xcite and the scrit @xcite project in the nearby future , using exotic nuclei provided by radioactive isotope beams .",
    "we have confined our study to medium and heavy mass isotopes where the mean field approach can be applied .",
