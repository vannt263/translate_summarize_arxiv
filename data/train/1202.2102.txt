    "nonlocality is an old age theme in the quest of regular ( ultraviolet complete ) theories of fundamental interactions @xcite , but for long time it has largely been ignored due to the initial success of regularization schemes .",
    "however , when gravity is concerned , the usual renormalization procedure runs into insurmountable difficulties and nonlocality might turn out to be an unavoidable requirement .",
    "this is due to the fact that we expect the spacetime to drastically change its nature when probed at distances comparable to the planck length .",
    "in such a view the conventional description in terms of smooth differential manifold would be just the low energy limit for a highly exited , granular spacetime plagued by local loss of resolution .",
    "this feature is translated as the emergence of a natural cut off , _",
    "i.e. _ , a fundamental length supposed to cure the usual bad short distance behavior of gravity .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that all the major formulations of quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , asymptotically safe gravity , noncommutative geometry , generalized uncertainty principle encode the idea of a fundamental length and turn out to be not local in the conventional sense . given this background we could proceed by analyzing the nonlocal character emerging in one of the current candidate theories of quantum gravity and possibly derive phenomenological consequences from it . even if fascinating , this route might present additional difficulties which may vary according to the limitations of each specific formulation . alternatively one would like to study nonlocality , as a specific character by itself , irrespective of the above formulations of quantum gravity .",
    "in such a way one could hope to disclose , in a simpler way , deep conceptual features about the issue of the ultraviolet completion of gravity and , in principle , confront the conclusions with those coming from the above candidate theories of quantum gravity .",
    "this research program is so intriguing that many authors have employed nonlocal theories in a variety of contexts ( for an incomplete list of examples see @xcite ) .",
    "the standard procedure to implement nonlocal effects consists in considering an infinite order of derivative terms in field actions . among the several possibilities , in this paper we want to study the effect of nonlocality on the gravitational field by assuming the form of the action recently proposed in @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath1 where in place of the ricci scalar @xmath2 we have @xmath3 with @xmath4 a bi - local distribution defined by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is an operator of @xmath7 , the dimensionless generally covariant dalembertian operator , and @xmath8 a free parameter which fixes the length scale of the theory .",
    "the above action can be seen as the leading term of what recently proposed in the context of a quantum theory of gravity with higher derivative corrections to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "the general strategy of theories of this kind is to find a suitable form of @xmath6 so that the euclidean momentum space function @xmath9 plays the role of the cutoff function in the quantum gravity perturbation theory expanded against a fixed background spacetime at all orders .    to reach the above goal we need to restrict the functional class where @xmath10 can be chosen . for notational convenience ,",
    "let us start by writing the euclidean momentum space representation of @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "according to @xcite , the first requirement for @xmath11 is to be an entire function when treated as a function of the complex variable @xmath13 .",
    "otherwise any singularities of the function @xmath11 for finite @xmath13 will lead to the appearance of some additional non - physical singularities in ( [ uvfeh ] ) .",
    "then we distinguish three possible cases .",
    "first , the function @xmath11 is an entire function of order @xmath14 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a positive number . for these functions",
    "there is not any direction in the complex plane @xmath13 , along which they could decrease .",
    "consequently , they can not play the role of the cutoff functions and in this case it is impossible to make the perturbation theory finite .",
    "a second case occurs when the function @xmath11 is an entire function of order @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17 such a function may have only one direction in the complex plane along which it may decrease and provide a consistent cutoff .",
    "finally the third choice is an entire function of order higher than @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a positive function satisfying the condition @xmath20 at @xmath21 for any @xmath22 .",
    "such a function may have some regions where it converges when @xmath21 so that it may be chosen as a cutoff function for the construction of a finite unitary perturbation theory .    in this paper",
    "we draw our attention to nonlocal gravity as emerging from virtual graviton exchange . to this purpose",
    "we recall that the family of noncommutative geometry inspired black holes ( ncbhs ) @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) corresponds to black hole solutions of nonlocal gravity with an operator @xmath10 represented in terms of an entire function of order higher than @xmath0 @xcite , _ i.e. _ , @xmath23 for the strong nonlocal character implemented by entire functions of this kind , ncbhs exhibit intriguing features .",
    "first , ncbhs consistently reproduce at scales larger than @xmath8 the behaviour of the corresponding einstein gravity black holes .",
    "second , ncbhs enjoy regularity properties at the origin , where in place of the conventional curvature singularity a regular desitter core accounts for the nonlocal , fluctuating character of the manifold in terms of quantum vacuum energy associated to virtual gravitons",
    ". local violations of energy conditions at the origin confirm the departure from a classical description of the gravitational field at short scales .",
    "third , ncbhs have an improved thermodynamics : the hawking temperature , even for the static , neutral case , admits a maximum followed by a positive heat capacity , stable , terminal phase of the evaporation @xcite .",
    "in addition ncbhs have companion geometries like regular collapsing shells @xcite and traversable wormholes @xcite .    despite their attractive features",
    ", ncbhs might not be the only kind of nonlocal black holes . as a consequence we want to study the case of entire functions different from ( [ ncentire ] ) .",
    "the goal of this investigation is twofold : on the one hand we would like to know if the new features of ncbhs depend on the specific choice of the above entire function or can be considered as general characters of nonlocality ; on the other hand we would like to release the strong requirement of entire function of order higher than @xmath0 to study milder and more economic nonlocal modifications of gravity .",
    "not surprisingly , in doing so we will show that not only noncommutative geometry but also a theory based on the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) is nothing else than a particular realization of a nonlocal theory .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ uno ] we derive the general form of nonlocal corrections to black hole metrics , in section [ due ] we analyze the case of an entire function of order @xmath0 , in section [ tre ] we study a model of gup black hole and finally in section [ quattro ] we draw the conclusions by comparing all the existing families of black holes derived up to now in this way .",
    "to derive nonlocal effects on the gravitational interaction we need an action to describe how the nonlocal geometry , modeled by ( [ uvfeh ] ) , behaves when coupled to a static matter source , _ i.e. _ , @xmath24 where the matter action @xmath25 will be specified below .",
    "the field equations can be obtained by varying ( [ totaction ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath26 . by neglecting surface terms coming from the variation of the generally - covariant dalembertian",
    ", we find the nonlocal version of einstein equations @xcite @xmath27 we notice that these equations can be cast in an equivalent form .",
    "the advantage of the euclidean momentum space representation is that @xmath10 becomes an elliptic operator and therefore has a unique , well defined inverse .",
    "one can conveniently work in euclidean momentum space and rotate back to pseudo euclidean spacetime at the end of the calculation . as a result one finds @xmath28 where the divergence free tensor @xmath29 eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) has the familiar form of einstein gravity coupled to a generalized source term @xmath30 , while ( [ e0 ] ) describes nonlocal gravity equations coupled to ordinary matter @xmath31 .",
    "the two forms are equivalent . as a static source we consider the case of a pressure - less static fluid at the origin whose action is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy density describing a massive , point - like particle .",
    "the corresponding energy momentum tensor reads @xmath34 and the spacetime , solution of either ( [ e0 ] ) and ( [ e1 ] ) , enjoys the usual static , spherically symmetric form @xmath35 where the coefficient @xmath36 has the form @xmath37 the function @xmath38 is the unknown and incorporates all the sought effects of nonlocality . in the limit @xmath39 ,",
    "the function @xmath38 is subject to the requirement of matching newton s constant , @xmath40 . before solving the above equations one has to prescribe the form of @xmath6",
    "we start by considering the entire functions of order @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath43 to determine @xmath38 , it is more convenient to follow the gravity field equations in the form ( [ e1 ] ) and derive @xmath44 by applying @xmath45 on @xmath31 . for later convenience",
    "we temporarily adopt free falling cartesian - like coordinates and we calculate @xmath46 as a first step we introduce the following schwinger representation @xmath47 second we apply the above operator on the dirac delta , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath48 as a result one obtains the action of the operator @xmath49 , _",

    "it admits just @xmath54 moments .",
    "we recall that physically the quantity @xmath55 is the energy density , which is smeared out for the effect of nonlocality .",
    "therefore the mass @xmath56 is no longer concentrated into a point but it is `` diluted '' according to @xmath57 this mass cumulative distribution @xmath58 lets us solve einstein equations in terms of the metric component written as @xmath59 . by equating the latter with ( [ ef ] ) , one can determine the initial unknown @xmath60 the final step is to calculate the above integral .",

    "specifically we have the noncommutative schwarzschild black hole ( `` nc - schw '' ) @xcite , the noncommutative dirty black hole ( `` nc - dirty '' ) @xcite - both corresponding to nonlocal gravity solutions with entire function of order higher than @xmath0 - the nonlocal gravity black hole with entire function of order @xmath0 ( `` @xmath41 '' ) and the gup modified black hole ( `` gup '' ) - corresponding to a nonlocal gravity solution with entire function of order lower than @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     as expected from the general theory @xcite , nonlocality determines a uv complete theory of gravity only if the order of entire functions is @xmath202 .",
    "we showed that this can be translated into the `` language of black holes '' by saying that curvature singularities are replaced by regular desitter cores which account for the quantum vacuum energy of virtual gravitons . in the case of @xmath203",
    "such a vacuum energy develops ( a fact that can be viewed by looking at the violation of energy conditions in the vicinity of the origin ) but it is not regularized .",
    "the net effect is just a deformation of the profile of the curvature singularity whose degree of divergence is decreased . as a result for all",
    "@xmath204 one finds that the newtonian potential admits a maximum and vanishes at the origin . on the other hand at large scales nonlocal",
    "effects quickly die off and all black hole metrics consistently match the classical schwarzschild geometry .",
    "we showed that the presence of stationary points of the newtonian potential for all @xmath204 has repercussions in two directions : i ) the global structure of the corresponding black hole solutions is modified by allowing the horizon extremization ; ii ) the hawking temperature does not diverge because the black hole undergoes a phase transition from a negative heat capacity evaporation phase to a positive heat capacity cooling down which terminates with a zero temperature remnant configuration .",
    "accordingly the black hole temperature never reaches values high enough to disrupt the geometry by permitting a consistent semiclassical description of all the evaporation process .",
    "the remnant mass is not only the mass of the black hole in the extremal configuration but also the threshold mass for developing horizons : lighter masses lead to horizonless regular geometries for @xmath202 and naked singularities for @xmath14 .",
    "in addition for all @xmath204 the area law of the black hole entropy is preserved in form : the only modification occurs at the level of coupling constant where the usual @xmath127 is replaced by the nonlocal running coupling @xmath128 .",
    "in summary we showed that the way nonlocality deforms the short distance behavior of gravity has model independent characters with the only exception of the singularity avoidance in the case @xmath14 .",

    "the phenomenology of microscopic black holes in particle detectors nonlocal deformations of black hole thermodynamics might lead to distinctive signatures .",
    "even if in the present paper we studied the four dimensional case only we argue that the possibility of having a maximum black hole temperature would imply a hawking emission in terms of soft particle on the brane , a fact that is in marked contrast to the results for schwarzschild black holes as shown in @xcite . on the other hand in the presence of a non - asymptotically flat term , _",
    "i.e. _ a cosmological constant , nonlocal black holes have a thermodynamics equivalent to a van der waals gas in which the role of the average volume occupied by a particle is played by the cut off @xmath8 ( or equivalently @xmath154 in the gup case ) @xcite . on the ground of this result , one may think to exploit the black hole phase transition to describe , via the gauge - gravity duality paradigm , the nuclear matter transition from the `` classical '' skyrme crystal to a phase where quantum effects weaken the bond between baryons and eventually melt the crystal into a nuclear gas with consequent switch of the deconfinement phase into a cross over ( for more details see @xcite ) . as a related issue to black holes we recall that the uv completeness of these theories can lead to a two - dimensional planck scale spectral dimension for a diffusive process propagating over a nonlocal background manifold @xcite .",
    "this fact is important since it lets us conclude that nonlocality might be the key ingredient to disclose self - renormalizability properties of gravity at the planck scale , by virtue of a mechanism of dynamical dimensional reduction .",
    "all the above considerations hold at a qualitative level while the families of nonlocal black holes are quantitatively slightly different ( see tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] for a summary of their properties and parameters ) .",
    "we think that their differences are an advantage rather than a limitation .",
    "for instance having different values for the threshold mass implies a variety of scenarios for the production of black holes , that , by considering only the case of @xmath200 theories , would be out of reach of the present ground based experiments @xcite . in an ideal world",
    "one would like to reverse the logic by trying to determine the exact profile of the entire function @xmath10 from experiments .",
    "this can be done also in the absence of extradimension : it has been shown that neutrino oscillations are sensible to nonlocal gravity modifications opening the possibility of direct observations in neutrino telescopes like icecube and antares @xcite .",
