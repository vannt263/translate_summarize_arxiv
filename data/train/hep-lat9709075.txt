    "supersymmetry is difficult to realize on the lattice .",
    "this is not so surprising since the lattice regularization breaks the translational invariance , which forms a subgroup of the supersymmetry .",
    "as the translational invariance is restored in the continuum limit , we can restore supersymmetry in the continuum limit .",
    "but the price we have to pay for the latter is that we need fine - tuning in general . for 4d @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills",
    "( sym ) theory , one can use the wilson - majorana fermion for the gaugino and recover supersymmetry in the continuum limit by fine - tuning the hopping parameter to the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "some numerical works have been started along this line @xcite .",
    "fine - tuning is a hard task , however , as is known in the numerical studies of the chiral limit in qcd , and a method without fine - tuning is highly desired .",
    "the overlap formalism @xcite can be used for this purpose , since it preserves exact chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "the problem here is that the formalism is not suitable for numerical simulation as it stands . a practical proposal made by ref .",
    "@xcite is to use the domain - wall formalism @xcite , and to decouple the unwanted zero mode by adding majorana mass term for it .    in this article",
    ", we examine whether this approach really works when the gauge field is switched off as a first step .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian of the system numerically and study the dispersion relation of the energy eigenstates for various additional majorana mass .",
    "the action of the model consists of two parts : @xmath1 @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 . with this action ,",
    "one obtains a right - handed massess weyl fermion and a left - handed one localized at the boundaries of the fifth direction @xmath5 , respectively . in the @xmath6 limit ,",
    "the chiral symmetry is exact and we end up with one massless dirac fermion @xcite . for finite @xmath7 ,",
    "the chiral symmetry is broken but this breaking vanishes exponentially with increasing @xmath7 @xcite .    when we consider 4d @xmath0 sym theory , the fermion is in the adjoint representation , which is real , and",
    "hence the weyl fermions can be viewed as majorana fermions , one of which has to be decoupled , while the other kept exactly massless .",
    "let us identify the zero mode in @xmath8 as the massless majorana fermion we want , namely the gaugino .",
    "in order to decouple the unwanted zero mode in @xmath9 , we introduce the additional term @xmath10 to the action . note that since the fermions are in a real representation , we can introduce majorana mass term for each weyl fermion , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , independently , without violating the gauge symmetry .",
    "there is a variety of choice for the @xmath10 , but as the simplest one , we restrict ourselves to the majorana mass term for the @xmath9 localized at the boundary @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath12",
    "we derive the hamiltonian of the system from the action and diagonalize it numerically . since we have switched off the gauge field ,",
    "the system is translationally invariant , and therefore we can partially diagonalize the hamiltonian by working in the momentum basis . we calculate numerically the energy eigenvalues for fixed three - dimensional momentum @xmath13 .    for moderate majorana mass",
    "we have one massless weyl fermion localized at @xmath14 as expected .",
    "figure  [ fig : dispersion1 ] shows the energy of @xmath8 and @xmath9 as a function of @xmath15 where @xmath16 when the majorana mass is @xmath17 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath8 has a linear dispersion relation , while the @xmath9 has a mass gap .",
    "= 6.5 cm    one might think that larger majorana mass only results in larger mass for @xmath9 without any problem , but this is not the case . figure  [ fig : dispersion2 ] shows the dispersion relation for large majorana mass @xmath18 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    one can see that although the @xmath8 remains massless , the doublers of @xmath8 become massless also .    in order to clarify the situation , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : doubler ] the mass of the next lightest mode at @xmath19 as well as that of the doublers of @xmath8 as a function of the majorana mass .",
    "the doublers have mass of the order of the cutoff for @xmath20 , but for @xmath21 , the mass decreases with increasing majorana mass as @xmath22",
    ". the doublers with many @xmath23 s in the momentum component are heavier than those with less @xmath23 s .",
    "the mass of the next lightest mode at @xmath19 grows linearly as the majorana mass increases , but saturates for @xmath24 . by looking at the wave functions , we find that this mode consists mostly of @xmath9 for @xmath25 , and becomes a mixture of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath26 .",
    "the behavior of the doublers for large majorana mass we have seen in the previous section can be understood in terms of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the situation considered is the case in which dirac mass and majorana mass term coexist .",
    "when we diagonalize the mass matrix of the fermion , a very small eigenvalue appears when the majorana mass is much larger than the dirac mass .",
    "in fact , the doublers have the two types of mass term in our model .",
    "the dirac mass term comes from the wilson term in ( [ action0 ] ) and can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of @xmath23 s in the momentum component of the doubler . together with the majorana mass term which comes from ( [ majorana ] )",
    ", we have the following mass matrix for the doublers . @xmath29 the eigenvalues of this matrix for @xmath30 are given by @xmath31,@xmath32 .",
    "the second one is almost zero for @xmath33 , which explains why the doublers become very light for large majorana mass .",
    "we examined whether the proposal for decoupling the unwanted zero - mode in the domain - wall approach by adding the majorana mass term for it works when the gauge field is switched off .",
    "above all , we clarified what values we should take for the majorana mass to be added .",
    "we observed the desired dispersion relation for moderate values of the majorana mass , which means that the approach is promising .",
    "we pointed out , however , that for too large majorana mass , the doublers of the desired majorana fermion become very light .",
    "we gave a natural explanation for this phenomenon in terms of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "we can also obtain the above result by the analysis of the fermion propagator @xcite , which will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our next task is of course to switch on the gauge field , which we would like to report in future publications ."
