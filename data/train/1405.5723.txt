    "this association of a grb and a sn occurs most commonly in a family of less energetic long grbs with the following characteristics : 1 ) isotropic energies @xmath3 in the range of @xmath4@xmath5  erg @xcite ; 2 ) a soft spectrum with rest - frame peak energy @xmath6  kev , although the instruments are sensitive up to gev ; 3 ) supernova emissions are observable up to a cosmological distance @xmath7 .",

    "family 2_.    doubts were advanced that sne may be associated with very bright long grbs : naive energetic arguments considered that there can hardly be a sn in a powerful grb within the single star collapse model ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the issue of the coincidence of very energetic grbs with sn has represented for some years an authentic `` terra incognita '' .",
    "the crucial point is to clarify whether this association of grbs and sne is only accidental or necessary , independent of their energetics . up to june 2014 , out of @xmath12 long grbs with known redshift @xmath7 , 19 grbs associated with sne belonging to the _ family 2 _ have been observed @xcite , and grb 130427a with isotropic energy @xmath13  erg is the most energetic one so far .",

    "actually the possible relevance of a binary system in the explanation of grbs was already mentioned in a pioneering work of @xcite and in @xcite , but the binaries in their case were a trigger to the traditional collapsar model .    the opportunity to probe the igc paradigm has come from the prototypical source grb 090618 , a member of _ family 2_. this source , has an extremely high energetics ,",

    "it soon became clear that this _ episode 3 _ , which had been interpreted in the traditional approach as part of the grb afterglow @xcite , appeared to be the seat of a set of novel independent process occurring after the end of the grb emission and preceding the optical observation of the sn , which we indicated as _",
    "episode 4_.    recently , progress has been made in the analysis of _ episode 1_. it is characterized by the explosion of the feco core , followed by the hypercritical accretion onto the ns which leads to the reaching of the critical mass of the ns and consequently to its induced gravitational collapse to a bh . the hypercritical accretion of the sn ejecta onto the ns has been estimated using the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton formalism to be @xmath43 , here @xmath44 is the solar mass @xcite , see e.g. , in@xcite .",

    "as observations of additional sources fulfilling the igc paradigm were performed , some precise qualifying features for characterizing _ episode 3 _ have been found :    \\a ) in some grbs with known redshift belonging to this _ family 2 _ the late x - ray luminosities at times larger than @xmath0  s appeared to overlap , when duly scaled in the proper rest frame of the grb source .",

    "this unexpected result has led to adopt this universal luminosity versus time relation in the late x - ray emission of _ episode 3 _ as a distance indicator .",
    "for some grbs without a known cosmological redshift and exhibiting the general features of the four episodes , we imposed the overlapping of the late power law x - ray emission in their _ episode 3 _ with the ones of the * _ gs _ * and we have consequently inferred the value of the cosmological redshift of the source .",

    "in fact , prior to grb 130427a , the only known case of an equally energetic source , grb 080319b , gave some evidence of an optical bump @xcite , but in no way a detailed knowledge of the sn spectrum or type .",

    "contrary to the traditional approach which generally considers a grb to be composed of the prompt emission followed by the afterglow , both of which vary from source to source , the igc paradigm for this _ family 2 _ has introduced the _ episode 3 _ which shows regularities and standard late time light curves , largely independent of the grb energy .",

    "we first proceed to identify the power law component of the light curve after the steep decay and the end of the plateau .",
    "this power law component , in the present case of this most energetic source grb 130427a , has a power law index @xmath80 and it extends all the way from @xmath58  s to @xmath81  s without jet breaks .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which find no jet break , but differs from @xcite in which a break of the later time light curve is claimed .",
    "we turn now to an additional crucial point : to confirm that the x ray emission of _ episode 3 _ belongs to the sn ejecta and not to the grb .",
    "to do this it is crucial , as already done for other sources , to determine the presence of a thermal component in the early time of _ episode 3 _ and infer its temperature and the size of its emitter . indeed , by analyzing the xrt data , we find that adding a blackbody component efficiently improves the fit with respect to a single power law from 196  s to 461  s. the corresponding blackbody temperature decreases in that time duration from @xmath82  kev to @xmath83  kev , in the observed frame .",
    "figure [ pobb ] shows the evolution of the power law plus blackbody spectra in three time intervals , clearly the flux of thermal component drops along the time , as well as the temperature corresponding to the peak flux energy decreases .",
    "@xcite find that a single power law is enough to fit the _",
    "data in the _ nustar _ epochs , the reason could be that the thermal component has faded away or exceeded the observational capacity of the _ swift _ satellite in the _ nustar _ epochs , which start later than @xmath84  s.    by assuming that the blackbody radiation is isotropic in the rest frame , the emitter radius along the light of sight increases from @xmath85  cm at 196  s to @xmath86  cm at 461  s in the observed frame , orders of magnitude smaller than the emission radius of the grb , which is larger than @xmath87  cm in the traditional grb collapsar afterglow model .",
    "the size of @xmath88  cm at hundreds of seconds is consistent with the observation of supernova ejecta . after considering the cosmological and the relativistic corrections , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the time in the laboratory and observed frame respectively , and @xmath2 is the lorentz factor of the emitter",

    "in addition to the traditional requirements for the optical supernova emission in _ episode 4 _ , the much more energetically demanding requirement for the general multi - wavelength emission of _ episode 3 _ has to be addressed .      in the previous sections",
    "we have emphasized the clear evidence of gev emission and its analogy in the late power law luminosities as functions of the arrival time for the x - ray , optical and gev emissions . equally important in this section",
    "is to emphasize some differences between the x- , @xmath9-ray , and the high energy gev emission , especially with respect to the onset of _ episode 3 _ at the end of prompt emission in _ episode 2 _ ( see fig .  [ gev ] ) .",

    "we have analyzed the gev emission from @xmath103 s to @xmath104 s , dividing this time interval into seven sub - intervals and in each of them collecting the corresponding maximum photon energy and photon index of the spectral energy distribution , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the extended interaction of the @xmath16-ns and its binary ns companion in the sn ejecta provides environment for @xmath115-processes to create the needed neutron rich very heavy elements to attribute some of the electromagnetic energy in _ episode 3 _ to nuclear decay , @xmath116  erg .",

    "also these processes can lead to a power law spectrum @xcite , similar to the one presented in this article and in our recent letter .",
    "the grb emission of _ episode 2 _ interacting with the supernovae ejecta could represent that energy injection long sought by fermi for the onset of his acceleration mechanism @xcite .    both of the above processes can indeed operate as energy sources for the mildly relativistic x - ray component and the relativistic gev emission of _ episode 3_.    we are currently examining additional bdhn sources and giving particular attention to understanding the highest gev energy emission , which is unexpected in the traditional @xmath115-process . the inferred @xmath2 lorentz factor for the gev emission point to the possibility of a direct role of the two remaining components in the igc paradigm : the newly born neutron star ( @xmath16ns ) and the just born black hole ( see fig .  [ matrix ] )",
    "there is also the distinct possibility that these two systems have themselves become members of a newly born binary system @xcite .",
    "we have recalled that grb 130427a is one of the most energetic grbs ever observed ( @xmath117  ergs ) , with the largest @xmath9-ray fluence and the longest lasting simultaneous optical , x - ray , @xmath9-ray and gev observations of the past 40 years .",
    "for this reason we have performed our own data analysis of the _ swift _ and _ fermi _ satellites ( see secs .  [ sec:3 ] ) in order to probe the bdhn nature of this source ( see sec .  [ sec:3.3 ] ) and infer new perspectives for the igc paradigm and the physical and astrophysical understanding of grb .",
    "we summarize the main results by showing how the analysis of grb 130427a should be inserted in a wider context with three different areas : a)the formulation and the observational consequences of the igc paradigm ; b ) the comprehension induced by the multi - wavelength observations of grb130427a ; c ) the bdhn versus hn properties .",
    "relevance of bdhn in establishing a new alternative distance indicator in astrophysics .",
    "each one of these topic is going to be summarized in 3 bullets .",
    "1a ) the igc paradigm introduces in astrophysics a new experience which has been already successfully applied in particle physics : to understand that a system traditionally considered elementary is actually a composed system and that new components in the system can appear at the effect of collisions or decay .",
    "well known physical examples are represented by the introduction of the quark @xcite , or the creation of new particles in a decay or collision of elementary particle systems : the fermi theory of beta decay or the mesons production in en electron positron collision in storage rings are classical examples .",
    "these facts are today routinely accepted in particle physics although fermi had to spend efforts to explain them at the time @xcite . in astrophysics this situation is new : to see that a process until recently considered elementary , as the grb , does indeed contains four different astrophysical systems and that two of them , the feco core undergoing sn and the companion ns binary , interacting give origin to two different new system a @xmath16ns and a bh and especially that the entire process occur in less the 200 s is a totally new condition . for its understanding a new approach technically and conceptually is needed .",
    "the new style of research is more similar to the one adopted in particle physics then the one in classical astronomy , see figure [ matrix ] .",
    "2a ) possibly the most profound novelty in this approach , for the understanding of grbs , has been the introduction of the four episodes shortly summarized in sec.[sec:1 ] .",
    "the traditional grb description corresponds to _",
    "episode 2_. _ episode 1 _ corresponds to the dynamical accretion of the sn ejecta onto the companion ns .",
    "we are now considering an enormous rate of accretion of @xmath118  g  s@xmath119 , @xmath87 times larger then the one usually considered in binary x - ray source in systems like centaurus x-3 or cygnus x-1 ( see e.g. , in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this process has opened a new field of research by presenting the first realization of the hypercritical accretion introduced by bondi - hoyle - littleton as well the testing ground of the neutrinos emission pioneered in the @xcite and @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] .",
    "the pure analytic simplified solutions in @xcite have been now supported by direct numerical simulation in ( * ? ? ? * and fig .  1 therein ) .",
    "3a ) the main revolution of the igc paradigm for grbs comes from the discovery of the universal laws discovered in _",
    "episode 3 _ which compare and contrast to the explosive , irregular phases , varying from source to source in all observed grbs , in their _ episode 1 _ and _ episode 2_.the universality of _ episode 3 _ as well as the precise power laws and scaling laws discovered changes the field of grb analysis making it one of time resolved , high precision , reproducible measurements .",
    "additional unexplored physical phenomena occurs in _ episode 3 _ , adding to the new ultra - relativistic regimes already observed in the _ episode 2 _ in previous years , see figure [ pisani ] and figure [ nesting ] as well as figure [ lc ] .",
    "1b ) following the work on the * _ gs _ * @xcite and the more recent work on the nested structures , we have first verified that the soft x - ray emission of grb 130427a follows for time @xmath120  s the power - law decay described in @xcite .",
    "surprisingly in this most energetic grb unveils such power - law behavior already exists at the early time as t @xmath121  s ( details in ) . from the x - ray thermal component observed at the beginning of _ episode 3 _ following a spiked emission at @xmath121  s , a small lorentz factor of the emitter is inferred ( @xmath122 ) : this x - ray emission appear to originate in a mildly relativistic regime with a velocity @xmath123 , in addition it does not appear to have substantial beaming and appears to be relatively symmetric and with no jet break , see figure [ lc ] , and .",
    "2b ) we have proceeded to make a multi - wavelength analysis of _ episode 3 _ where we have compared and contrasted optical data from _ swift_-uvot and ground based telescopes , x - ray data from _ swift_-xrt , @xmath9-ray data from _ fermi_-gbm , as well as very high energy data in the gev from _ fermi_-lat .",
    "the high energy emission appears to be detectable at the end of the prompt radiation phase in _ episode 2 _ , when the fluence of x - ray and @xmath9-ray of the prompt exponentially decrease and becomes transparent for the very high energy photons in the _ fermi_-lat regime . from the transparency condition of the gev emission a lorentz gamma factor of @xmath124",
    "is deduced . in principle",
    "this radiation , although no brake in its power law is observed , could be in principle beamed , see figure [ gammagev ] .",
    "3b ) although the light curves of x - ray and gev emission appear to be very similar , sharing similar power - law decay index , their lorentz @xmath2 factors appear to be very different , and their physical origin are necessarily different . within the igc model the x - ray and the high energy can originate from the interaction of some of the physical components ( e.g. , neutron star and black hole ) newly created in the c - matrix : the interaction of the grbs with the sn ejecta @xcite may well generate the x - ray emission and the associated thermal component .",
    "the high energy should be related to the novel three components , the bh , the @xmath16ns and the sn ejecta . from the dynamics",
    "it is likely that the @xmath16ns and the bh form a binary system , see e.g. , @xcite and the presentation by one of the authors .",
    "1c ) the verification of the bdhn paradigm in grb 130427a has confirmed that for sources with isotropic energy approximately @xmath125  erg , the common power law behavior is attained at earlier times , i.e. , @xmath126  s , and higher x - ray luminosities than the characteristic time scale indicated in @xcite , see figure  [ pisani ] . from the observation of the constant - index power law behavior in the first @xmath61  s of the x - ray luminosity light curve , overlapping with the known bdhne , it is possible to have an estimate of : 1 ) the redshift of the source , 2 ) the isotropic energy of the grb and 3 ) the fulfillment of the necessary and sufficient condition for predicting the occurrence of the sn after @xmath109  days in the rest frame of the source , see e.g. , gcn 14526 .",
    "this procedure has been successfully applied to grb 140512a ( ruffini et al . in preparation ) .",
    "2c ) the overlapping with the * _ gs _ * members of the late x - ray emission observed by swift xrt , referred to the rest frame of the source , introduces a method to establish and independent distance estimator of the grbs .",
    "although this method has been amply applied ( e.g. grbs 060729 , 061007 , 080319 , 090618 , 091127 , 111228a ) , we also declare that there are some clear outlier to this phenomenon : grb 060614 @xcite , 131202a @xcite and 140206a @xcite .",
    "these are all cases of great interest and the solution of this contradictions my reveal to be of particular astrophysical significance .",
    "particularly interesting is the case of grb 060614 since the cosmological redshift has not been directly measured and there can be a misidentification of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "3c ) as first pointed out in @xcite and , further evidenced in @xcite , the crucial factor which may explain the difference between the _ family 1 _ and _ family 2 _ of grbs is the initial distance between the feco core and its binary ns companion . the accretion from the sn ejecta onto the companion ns and the consequent emission process decrease by increasing this distance : consequently is hampered the possibility for the binary companion ns to reach its critical mass .",
    "unlike _ family 2 _ , in _ family 1 _ no bh is formed , no grb is emitted , and no _ episode 2 _ nor _ episode 3 _ exist , only a softer and less energetic radiation from the accretion onto the neutron star will be observed in these sources .",
    "the problem of explaining the coincidence between the grb and supernova in the case of the _ family 1 _ is just a tautology : no grb in this family exist but only a hypernova .",
    "this article addresses recent results on the igc paradigm applied to long grbs .",
    "the igc paradigm and the merging of binary neutron stars has been also considered for short grbs and is now being further developed .",
    "we acknowledge the use of public data from the _ swift _ and _ fermi _ data achieve .",
    "we thank robert jantzen for his careful reading and valuable advise .",
