    "this paper presents a numerical investigation of a turbulent channel flow with sinusoidal spanwise oscillations of the walls . the flow over the oscillating walls results from the combination of two simpler flows , i.e. a canonical turbulent channel flow in the streamwise direction and an oscillating boundary - layer - type flow in the transversal ( spanwise ) direction .",
    "the most relevant characteristic of this modified turbulent flow is the time - sustained reduction of the streamwise wall - shear stress , first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the drag reduction effect is caused by the weakening of the relevant turbulence - producing events in the vicinity of the wall @xcite , but the precise details are still poorly understood .",
    "it has also been established @xcite that a net energetic saving of the order of 10% ( determined by taking into account the power spent to move the walls against the viscous resistance of the fluid ) can be obtained by carefully tuning the parameters of the oscillation .",
    "another property of this flow that will be exploited in the following is that , once the flow field is averaged along the streamwise and spanwise homogeneous directions , the spanwise velocity profile agrees with the laminar solution of the so - called second stokes problem @xcite , hence uncoupling from the complex dynamics of the all - encompassing turbulence . in the spirit of the wall - oscillation technique ,",
    "research works have appeared on the drag reduction effects of forcing the turbulence by spanwise travelling waves @xcite , by spanwise oscillating lorentz forces @xcite , by spanwise oscillating suction and blowing @xcite , and by steady streamwise oscillations of the spanwise wall velocity @xcite .",
    "the wall oscillation has also been shown to be effective in reducing the growth rate of the most unstable g@xmath1rtler vortex developing on a concave surface @xcite .",
    "an important step towards practical applications of the oscillating - wall technique is the recent finding of a scaling parameter @xmath0 that is suggested to be related to the amount of drag reduction .",
    "this parameter depends on the quantities defining the sinusoidal oscillation , namely the period of oscillation @xmath2 and the maximum wall velocity @xmath3 .",
    "( a third parameter describing the oscillation is the peak - to - peak wall displacement @xmath4 , which is @xmath5 for a sinusoidal waveform . ) @xcite have correlated their drag reduction direct numerical simulation ( dns ) data with @xmath0 , which was found from physical arguments pertaining to the interaction between the spanwise laminar stokes layer and the near - wall turbulence .",
    "a least - squares fit yielded a power - law expression for @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite ( denoted by qr hereafter ) have recently improved the analysis by @xcite on the basis of a dns dataset of a turbulent channel flow modified by the motion of both walls , for a reynolds number @xmath6 defined by the friction velocity of the natural turbulent flow and half the distance between the channel walls .",
    "the accuracy of their dataset brought to light a linear relation between the drag reduction and @xmath0 , which was suggested to hold as long as @xmath2 remains smaller than a typical integral time scale of the wall turbulence .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to investigate further the possibility of estimating the drag reduction through the parameter @xmath0 . in qr the correlation analysis between @xmath0 and the drag reduction",
    "was carried out only with their dns data . in the present analysis",
    "all the drag reduction datasets available in the literature are employed to compute a new , and more general , least - squares fit .",
    "a useful by - product of this procedure is that each dataset ( both from experiments and dns ) can be discussed in terms of its difference from the fit . since the literature data show a considerable scatter , comparing the actual measurements of drag reduction with the predictions via @xmath0 permits an indirect assessment of their accuracy .",
    "the linear fit allows us to identify and study easily two distinct periods of wall oscillation that are optimal in terms of drag reduction .",
    "although in dns studies the oscillation parameters can be chosen freely , @xmath7 , the optimal period of oscillation for fixed maximum wall velocity , has usually been the quantity of interest . on the other hand ,",
    "an experimental campaign is likely to reveal @xmath8 , the optimal period at fixed maximum wall displacement .",
    "indeed , in a laboratory the wall motion is usually produced by a crank - slider mechanism , which allows varying @xmath2 for fixed @xmath4 .",
    "qr however noted that @xmath8 had never been observed by experimentalists , probably because the flow at these high frequencies of oscillation is difficult to test .",
    "the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath7 was left unnoticed until qr pointed out that @xmath8 should be smaller than @xmath7 , which is known to be constant at @xmath9 ( when scaled by the friction velocity of the undisturbed flow , karniadakis and choi , 2003 ) .",
    "qr s analysis also showed that @xmath8 should be a function of @xmath4 itself .",
    "although their limited data appeared to validate these unconfirmed conjectures , it is an important aim of the present study to verify the existence of @xmath8 and to assess its properties .    the analytical expression for @xmath0 yields additional information .",
    "as a further aim , we shall use @xmath0 to seek the smallest values of the oscillation parameters which guarantee a non - zero drag reduction effect .",
    "these oscillating conditions are referred to as  minimal \" throughout the paper .",
    "the same analysis will also allow us to determine the oscillatory conditions needed to attain a specified amount of drag reduction and of net energy saving .",
    "we shall also address the important issue of the effect of reynolds number on the drag reduction .",
    "this point is still open to discussion , as the conclusions of previous studies do not fully agree .",
    "the experimental analysis of a turbulent boundary layer by @xcite has shown that increasing the reynolds number based on the momentum thickness and free - stream velocity from @xmath10=500 to 1400 ( with @xmath11 ) had no influence on the drag reduction .",
    "@xcite s experimental results in a pipe flow modified by circular wall oscillations have also indicated that changing the reynolds number based on the bulk velocity and the pipe diameter from @xmath12=23,300 to 36,300 gives variations of drag reduction which are of the order of the uncertainty range .",
    "the dns of a turbulent channel flow conducted by @xcite has instead revealed that the reduction in wall friction can be halved by increasing the reynolds number from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we shall carry out a few dns to ascertain whether or not increasing @xmath15 affects the drag reduction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "procedure ] , the numerical procedure and the discretization parameters are described .",
    "the main steps of the analysis by qr are briefly recalled in section  [ sec : laminar - analysis ] , where the parameter @xmath0 and the function @xmath8=@xmath16 are defined .",
    "section  [ sec : topt ] discusses the quality of the analytical prediction of @xmath8 on the basis of the dns results .",
    "the minimal wall forcing conditions and the dependence of the drag reduction on the oscillatory parameters are presented in section  [ sec : minimal ] .",
    "section  [ sec : reynolds ] describes the effect of the reynolds number on the drag reduction .",
    "section  [ sec : validation - datasets ] presents the drag reduction data available in the literature , providing an evaluative overview on the state of the art in terms of a comparison between the amounts of drag reduction and the estimates based on @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to a summary .",
    "we have studied the turbulent flow in a channel with moving walls through direct numerical simulations of the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations .",
    "the walls move in phase along the spanwise direction with velocity @xmath17 figure [ fig : figure_1 ] displays a sketch of the computational domain .    our pseudo - spectral solver is described in @xcite : it is based on fourier expansions in the homogeneous directions and on fourth - order accurate , compact finite - difference schemes for the discretization of the differential operators in the wall - normal direction .",
    "aliasing errors in the computation of the non - linear terms are eliminated by expanding the flow variables into a ( at least ) @xmath18 larger number of modes for each homogeneous direction before transforming from the fourier to the physical space .",
    "the temporal integration is carried out with a partially - implicit procedure : a third - order , low - storage runge - kutta method for the convective terms , and a second - order crank - nicolson scheme for the viscous terms .",
    "the mixed spatial discretization is advantageous from the viewpoint of parallel computing @xcite , and allows employing computing machines connected by standard networking hardware to achieve a large computational throughput .",
    "the simulations described in this paper have been carried out on a computing system available in dedicated mode at the university of salerno , made by 64 machines , each with two opteron cpus .",
    "we have performed the calculations at two values of the reynolds number : @xmath6 , 400 based on @xmath19 , half the distance between the channel walls , and on @xmath20 , the friction velocity of the uncontrolled case .",
    "the computational parameters for @xmath6 have been chosen to replicate those in qr , if exception is made for a slightly finer wall - normal discretization .",

    "the + superscript indicates quantities scaled by the inner units of the unperturbed turbulent flow .",
    "a few calculations with very high @xmath3 have required an even smaller ( up to one half ) time step , due to stability constraints .",
    "a single case at @xmath6 has taken 11 seconds for one time step and 5 days for the full simulation with 8 machines .",
    "the wall - clock time for the whole set of simulations has been slightly more than two weeks with the full use of the computational power .    for the @xmath6 case ,",
    "we have carried out one simulation for the canonical flow and 28 simulations for different @xmath28 pairs .",
    "the skin - friction coefficient for the fixed - wall case is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the time- and space - averaged streamwise wall - shear stress , @xmath31 is the fluid density and @xmath32 is the bulk velocity .",
    "this value essentially coincides with the value estimated by the following empirical formula given in @xcite at page 279 : @xmath33 three values of @xmath4 have been considered , @xmath34 . at a given @xmath4 , we have explored the existence of @xmath8 by varying @xmath2 along the hyperbola @xmath35 in the @xmath28 space .",
    "the amount of drag reduction has been determined by a procedure ( qr ) which involves discarding the initial temporal transient , averaging over time and along the homogeneous directions , and considering both walls to enlarge the statistical sample . for the @xmath14 case ,",
    "we have carried out one simulation for the canonical flow ( @xmath36 , only 1% smaller than the value given by ( [ eq : cf - re - tau ] ) ) and three simulations with @xmath37=12 and @xmath38=30 , 125 and 200 .",
    "the analysis is based on the close agreement between the space - averaged ( along the homogeneous directions ) spanwise flow and the laminar solution for the second stokes problem , defined by @xmath39 @xcite . at relatively high frequencies , the space - averaged spanwise flow uncouples from the space - averaged streamwise flow , although the spanwise turbulent fluctuations are significantly altered by the wall motion @xcite .",
    "we can explain this agreement as follows .",
    "the space - averaged spanwise momentum equation is @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the barred quantities are averaged along @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the turbulent spanwise velocity , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the wall - normal and spanwise velocity components fluctuating about their corresponding space - averaged quantities .",

    "[ fig : figure_2 ] shows @xmath50 at different oscillation phases from the start - up of the wall motion for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it initially increases , reaches a maximum when @xmath53 , and then decreases as the transient elapses after a few oscillation periods .",
    "as @xmath50 is negligible once the new modified turbulent flow is established , it follows that @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "the fact that @xmath56 does not coincide with @xmath57 during the initial transient is reflected in the time history of the space - averaged spanwise wall - shear stress @xmath58 .",
    "it is observed in fig .",
    "8 at page 12 in @xcite that this quantity deviates slightly from the laminar value at @xmath53 , when @xmath50 reaches its maximum value .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath0 is now introduced .",
    "it has been expressed by @xcite as the product of @xmath59 , the maximum acceleration of the stokes layer at a specified wall - normal location , and @xmath60 , a distance from the wall at which the oscillating layer directly affects the turbulent flow .    at the root of this procedure",
    "lies the laminar solution for the second stokes problem @xcite : @xmath61 the maximum spanwise acceleration @xmath59 at a wall - normal distance @xmath62 is obtained by differentiating ( [ eq : stokes ] ) with respect to @xmath63 : @xmath64 it is further required that the maximum spanwise velocity of the stokes layer at @xmath65 be larger than a typical value @xmath66 of the spanwise velocity fluctuations .",
    "the wall forcing must be intense enough for the stokes layer to influence the turbulent fluctuations and disrupt the near - wall turbulence - producing cycle . by imposing the above condition and",

    "we have assumed that @xmath150 does not change location in the @xmath113 space , which remains to be verified .",

    "accuracy concerns for dns - based datasets arise mostly from issues related to the spatio - temporal discretization and the computational procedures . in laboratory experiments hot - wire anemometry has often been employed and the measurements may have been biased by errors due to the highly three - dimensional flow field . a comparison among all the drag reduction data have been carried out by qr in the space of the parameters @xmath28 , but the analysis did not convey the desired information about the accuracy because of the high scatter of the data .",

    "the pipe flow data by @xcite at @xmath170 and @xmath171 also have the same slope , but are lower than the linear regression , probably on account of the high values of @xmath15 .",
