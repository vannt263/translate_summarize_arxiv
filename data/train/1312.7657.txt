    "radiative corrections to the graviton / matter vertex have been investigated since the 70 s by berends and gastmans @xcite in the qed case , who quantified the impact of these corrections to the bending of photons and fermions in an external localized gravitational field .",
    "these results were based on the study of 3-point functions ( gravitational form factors ) with two fermions ( @xmath1 ) or two photons ( @xmath2 ) in external gravity , and one insertion of the energy momentum tensor ( emt ) @xmath3 of the matter fields .    the very small size of these corrections , which affect the angles of deflection , combined with the experimental difficulty to improve on their direct measurements , call into question the possibility of using these effects as a possible test of general relativity .",
    "perhaps , it is for this reason that the study of the electroweak corrections to the bending angles have not drawn any attention on these processes until the analysis of @xcite and , more recently , of @xcite , which concern the fermion / graviton vertex .    in the photon case",
    ", the @xmath2 vertex in qed has been re - investigated in the analysis of the conformal anomaly action in @xcite , later extended to the electroweak case in @xcite . in the @xmath4 case",
    ", the study has been separated into the flavour - changing @xcite and flavour diagonal sectors @xcite , the first of the two playing a significant role in the analysis of possible flavour transitions in the presence of a scalar component in the external gravitational field , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this aspect will be re - addressed in our current study .",
    "the issue concerning the size of these corrections and their relevance can be resolved by noticing that the very same interactions become significant in the presence of sizeable gravitational backgrounds .",
    "such are those due to black holes , which are ubiquitous in galactic centers , and surging to remarkable relevance in the analysis of galaxy structure formation .",
    "obviously our formalism , which simply extends to the electroweak case the original analysis of @xcite , remains valid only in the case of small fluctuations around a flat spacetime metric , where curvature effects are ignored , and does not allow to handle backgrounds characterized by a strong curvature .",
    "it could , however , be extended to include further corrections related to the curvature scale of certain backgrounds , in the limit in which gravity is treated as an external classical source .    for this reason",
    ", we think that our analysis allows to highlight some of the basic features of the interaction of the standard model lagrangian , once this is immersed in a weak gravitational background , clarifying some of the specific features of this coupling at a perturbative level .",
    "in particular , the renormalizability of the theory , which remains intact in this extended framework , is an important feature of these computations , not shared by other backgrounds .",
    "one of the specific features of our results is their possible application to the neutrino sector , which has received some attention in recent years ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we will provide indeed the expression for the qed and electroweak corrections to the scattering of a neutrino off an external source .",
    "these results are the starting point in the derivation of the equation relating the angle of deflection to the impact parameter of the collision , in the case of a static heavy source of the gravitational field .",
    "the use of an impact parameter formalism allows to merge the usual quantum corrections , computed in the exact electroweak theory , with the semiclassical method in which the incoming asymptotic quantum state is described by a particle approaching the source at a distance @xmath5 , with @xmath5 denoting the impact parameter .",
    "this method has been used in @xcite and in the more recent literature on the computation of corrections to the gravitational scattering of quantum fields both in static @xcite and in rotating ( lense - thirring ) backgrounds @xcite . except for the case of the qed corrections , already discussed in @xcite and",
    "that we recompute , a general analysis of the weak corrections and of the modified lense equations , which may impact the structure of cosmic shears , is left to future work .",
    "the primary goal of our work is to extend our previous analysis of the @xmath1 vertex , by computing the radiative corrections to the cross section in an external gravitational field , in the limit of a source of large mass , i.e. in a scattering off a potential . in this case",
    "we discuss both the limits of low and high momentum transfers . at low momentum transfers",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian which describes the flavour - changing transitions .",
    "we also discuss the cross section for the exchange of a scalar component for the gravitational field , with the inclusion of the electroweak effects .",
    "our expressions for fermion scattering are specialized both to ordinary and to weakly interacting fermions , such as neutrinos or dark matter particles , by the inclusion of suitable form factors which account for interactions in the inner core of the source .",
    "we conclude our analysis with some perspectives and possible extensions of our work , to be left for further studies . being this work the third in a sequel @xcite",
    ", most of our previous notations and results will be necessary in order to proceed with the applications discussed here .",
    "in this section we briefly review the main features of the coupling of the standard model in an external gravitational field , focusing our attention on the fermion sector .",
    "we recall that the dynamics of the standard model plus gravity is described by the action = _ sm + _ g + _ i with @xmath6 containing the standard model ( sm ) lagrangian , while _ g & = & -d^4 x r + _ i & = & d^4 x r h^h [ thelagrangian ] denote respectively the einstein gravitational term of the action and a term of improved action @xmath7 , involving the higgs doublet @xmath8 .",
    "the latter is responsible for generating a symmetric and traceless energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is obtained by extending the ordinary lagrangian of the standard model to a curved metric background .",
    "@xmath7 vanishes in the flat space time limit , due to the vanishing of the ricci scalar in the same limit .",
    "its corresponding emt @xmath9 ) , however , is non - vanishing . with the inclusion of @xmath7 , varying the action @xmath10 with respect to the fields of the sm allows to generate an emt which is symmetric without any additional symmetrization .",
    "we remark that @xmath11 is conformal at the value @xmath12 and guarantees the renormalizability of the model , including all green functions at any order in @xmath13 containing only insertions of external graviton fields @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "we will be using the flat metric @xmath16 , with an expansion of the form & & g_= _ + h _",
    "+ o(^2 ) + & & g^=^ - h^ + o(^2 ) + & & = 1+h + o(^2 ) , where @xmath17 is the trace of the metric fluctuations .",
    "the interaction between the gravitational field and matter , at this order , is mediated by diagrams containing a single power of the emt @xmath18 and multiple fields of the standard model .",
    "the tree level coupling is summarized by the action _",

    "the complete emt of the standard model , including ghost and gauge - fixing contributions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the fermionic part of the emt is obtained using the vielbein formalism .",
    "indeed the fermions are coupled to gravity by using the spin connection @xmath20 induced by the curved metric @xmath21 .",
    "this allows the introduction of a derivative @xmath22 which is covariant both under gauge and diffeomorphism transformations .",

    "we will denote with @xmath31 the transition amplitude between the intial and the final state induced by the insertions of the emt vertex , with initial and final wave functions included , while @xmath32 will be denoting the corresponding vertex in momentum space , i.e. ^=|u(p_2)v^u(p_1 ) , having labeled the momenta of the incoming and outgoing fermion with @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",

    "the computation of the angle of deflection for the fermion involves a simple semiclassical analysis , in which one introduces the impact parameter representation of the same cross section .",

    "onbviously , the bending angle of neutrinos , charged leptons and dark matter particles will be affected by the geometry of the source and by the strength of the fermion interaction with the source .",
    "this will vary if , for instance , the particles are allowed to enter the core of the gravitational source , as in the neutrino and the dark matter cases . for this reason we will proceed by determining the structure of these corrections , providing more general cross sections beyond the point - like approximation .      once we allow a finite size for the mass distribution , expression ( [ leading ] ) gets modified .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for beams of neutrinos or dark matter particles which may have , in principle , impact parameters smaller than the source radius . in this case",
    ", it is intuitively clear that in the limit of a weak gravitational background , gauss theorem in gravity implies that only the region of the source of radius smaller than the particle impact parameter is relevant in the scattering process .",
    "this can be shown rigorously directly from the spherically symmetric schwarzschild metric .",
    "however , the proof - in the weak field limit - of factorization of the 3-dimensional euclidean metric from the schwarzschild solution , requires some technical steps which are left to an appendix ( appendix [ schw ] ) .",
    "this allows to avoid the use of polar projectors in the scattering amplitude - for spherically symmetric backgrounds - which would render the treatment more involved from the computational side .",
    "our discussion , here , is limited to the case of a uniform mass distribution , but it can be generalized to any distribution of spherical symmetry , in the weak field limit . using this result , it follows that the metric fluctuations of a distributed source can be described ( in @xmath79 units ) by the field h_= - |s _ with the potential of the distributed source @xmath80 , given by _ d(r)=-(r - r ) -(3 - ) ( r - r ) .",

    "* non - weakly interacting fermions *    for this reason , as in the case of the localized gravitational source , for non - weakly interacting fermions we restrict the integration region of the scattering amplitude in the form    i_if =- d x_0_>r d^3 p_2 |h_(x ) t^(x)| p_1 , where we have restricted the integration region to @xmath82 , i.e. outside the radius of the gravitational source . therefore , according to ( [ pot ] ) , it is convenient to denote the contributions to the gravitational field coming from the external region as @xmath83 . at leading order , for interactions",
