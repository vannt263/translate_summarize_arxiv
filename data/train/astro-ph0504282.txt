    "this paper is the second of a series dedicated at obtaining high resolution spectroscopy of distant galactic old open cluster giant stars to derive new or improved estimates of their metal content . in @xcite",
    "we presented results for berkeley  29 and saurer  1 , the two old open clusters possessing the largest galactocentric distance known , and showed that they do not belong to the disk , but to the monoceros feature ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) . here",
    "we present high - resolution spectra of four giant stars in the old open clusters berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 .",
    "the latter cluster , in particular , is of particular interest , since its heliocentric distance is among the largest currently known .",
    "+ with this paper we aim to enlarge the sample of old open clusters with metallicity obtained from high resolution spectra , and to test the common assumption of axisymmetry made in chemical evolution models about the structure of the milky way disk . for this purpose we selected two open clusters with about the same age located one ( berkeley  66 ) in the second galactic quadrant , and the other ( berkeley  22 ) in the third galactic quadrant .",
    "significant differences in metal abundance for clusters located in different disk zones would hopefully provide useful clues about the chemical evolution of the disk and about the role of accretion and infall phenomena .",
    "+ the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "sections  2 and 3 illustrate the observations and the data reduction strategies , while section  4 deals with radial velocity determinations . in section  5",
    "we derive the stellar abundances and in section  6 we revise the cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "the radial abundance gradient and the abundance ratios are discussed in section 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the results of this paper are finally discussed in section  9",
    "the observations were carried out on the night of november 30 , 2004 at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory under photometric conditions and typical seeing of 11 arcsec .",
    "the hires spectrograph @xcite on the keck i telescope was used with a 11 x 7 slit to provide a spectral resolution r = 34,000 in the wavelength range 5200@xmath18900   on the three 2048@xmath24096 ccds of the mosaic detector .",
    "a blocking filter was used to remove second - order contamination from blue wavelengths .",
    "three exposures of 15001800 seconds were obtained for the stars berkeley  22@xmath1400 and berkeley  22@xmath1579 . for both berkeley  66@xmath1785 and berkeley  66@xmath1934 we took four exposures of 2700 seconds each . during the first part of the night ,",
    "when the telescope pointed to berkeley  66 , the observing conditions were far from optimal , due to the presence of thick clouds .",
    "for this reason our abundance analysis in this first cluster is limited to berkeley  66@xmath1785 . for the wavelength calibration , spectra of a thorium - argon lamp",
    "were secured after the set of exposures for each star was completed . the radial velocity standard hd  82106",
    "was observed at the end of the night .",
    "+ in fig .  1 we show a finding chart for the two clusters where the four observed stars are indicated , while in fig .",
    "2 we show the position of the stars in the color@xmath1magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , based on published photometry ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "images were reduced using iraf , including bias subtraction , flat - field correction , frame combination , extraction of spectral orders , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction and spectral rectification .",
    "the single orders were merged into a single spectrum . as an example , we show in fig .  3 a portion of the reduced , normalized spectrum of be  22 - 400 .",
    "no radial velocity estimates were previously available for berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 .",
    "the radial velocities of the target stars were measured using the iraf fxcor task , which cross - correlates the object spectrum with the template ( hd  82106 ) .",
    "the peak of the cross - correlation was fitted with a gaussian curve after rejecting the spectral regions contaminated by telluric lines ( @xmath3   ) . in order to check our wavelength calibration",
    "we also measured the radial velocity of hd  82106 itself , by cross - correlation with a solar - spectrum template .",
    "we obtained a radial heliocentric velocity of 29.8@xmath40.1 km s@xmath5 , which perfectly matches the published value ( 29.7 km / sec ; @xcite ) .",
    "the final error in the radial velocities was typically about 0.2 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the two stars we measured in each clusters have compatible radial velocities ( see table  1 ) , and are considered , therefore , _ bona fide _ cluster members .",
    "we derived equivalent widths of spectral lines by using the standard iraf routine _",
    "splot_. repeated measurements show a typical error of about 5@xmath110 m , also for the weakest lines .",
    "the line list ( fei , feii , mg , si , ca , al , , na , ni and ti , see table  3 ) was taken from @xcite , who considered only lines with equivalent widths narrower than 150m , in order to avoid non - linear effects in the lte analysis of the spectral features .",
    "log(gf ) parameters of these lines were re - determinated using equivalent widths from the solar - spectrum template , solar abundances from @xcite and standard solar parameters ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "initial estimates of the atmospheric parameter @xmath7 were obtained from photometric observations in the optical .",
    "bvi data were available for berkeley  22 @xcite , while vi photometry for berkeley  66 has been taken from @xcite .",
    "reddening values are e(b@xmath1v)= 0.62 ( e(v@xmath1i)= 0.74 ) , and e(v@xmath1i)= 1.60 , respectively .",
    "first guess effective temperatures were derived from the ( v@xmath1i)@xmath7 and ( b@xmath1v)@xmath7 relations , the former from @xcite and the latter from @xcite .",
    "we then adjusted the effective temperature by minimizing the slope of the abundances obtained from fe  i lines with respect to the excitation potential in the curve of growth analysis .",
    "for both clusters the derived temperature yields a reddening consistent with the photometric one .",
    "+ initial guesses for the gravity @xmath8(g ) were derived from :    @xmath9    taken from @xcite . in this equation",
    "the mass @xmath10 was derived from the comparison between the position of the star in the hertzsprung@xmath1russell diagram and the padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "the luminosity @xmath11 was derived from the the absolute magnitude @xmath12 , assuming the literature distance moduli of 15.9 for berkeley  22 @xcite and 17.4 for berkeley  66 @xcite .",
    "the bolometric correction ( bc ) was derived from the relation bc@xmath7 from @xcite .",
    "the input @xmath8(g ) values were then adjusted in order to satisfy the ionization equilibrium of fe  i and fe  ii during the abundance analysis .",
    "finally , the micro@xmath1turbulence velocity is given by the following relation @xcite :    @xmath13 = 1.19 \\times 10^{-3 } \\times t_{eff } - 0.90 \\times",
    "log(g ) - 2\\ ] ]    the final adopted parameters are listed in table  2 .",
    "the lte abundance program moog ( freely distributed by chris sneden , university of texas , austin ) was used to determine the metal abundances .",
    "model atmospheres were interpolated from the grid of kurucz ( 1992 ) models by using the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8(g ) determined as explained in the previous section . during the abundance analysis @xmath7 , @xmath8(g ) and @xmath14",
    "were adjusted to remove trends in excitation potential , ionization equilibrium and equivalent width for fe  i and fe  ii lines .",
    "table  3 contains the atomic parameters and equivalent widths for the lines used .",
    "the first column contains the name of the element , the second the wavelength in  , the third the excitation potential , the fourth the oscillator strength @xmath8 ( _ gf _ ) , and the remaining ones the equivalent widths of the lines for the observed stars . +",
    "the derived abundances are listed in table  4 , together with their uncertainties .",
    "the measured iron abundances are [ fe / h]=@xmath10.32@xmath15 and [ fe / h]=@xmath10.48@xmath16 for berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 , respectively . the reported errors are derived from the uncertainties on the single star abundance determination ( see table  4 ) . for berkeley",
    "66@xmath1934 no abundance determination was possible because the s / n ratio in our spectrum was too low to perform any equivalent width determination .",
    "+ finally , using the stellar parameters ( colors , t@xmath17 and log(g ) ) and the absolute calibration of the mk system ( @xcite ) , we derived the stellar spectral classification , which we provide in table  1 .",
    "our study is the first to provide spectral abundance determinations of stars in berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 .",
    "here we briefly discuss the revision of the properties of these two clusters which follow from our measured chemical abundances ( see figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "we use the isochrone fitting method and adopt for this purpose the padova models from @xcite .",
    "berkeley  22 is an old open cluster located in the third galactic quadrant , first studied by @xcite . on the basis of deep vi photometry he derived an age of 3 gyr , a distance of 6.0 kpc and a reddening e(v@xmath1i)=0.74 .",
    "the author suggests that the probable metal content of the cluster is lower than solar .",
    "here we obtained [ fe / h]=@xmath10.32 , which corresponds to z=0.008 and roughly half the solar metal content .",
    "very recently @xcite presented new bvi photometry , on the basis of which they derive a younger age ( 2.0 - 2.5 gyr ) , but similar reddening and distance , also suggesting that the cluster posseses solar metal abundance .",
    "the two photometric studies are compatible in the vi filters , being the difference in the v and i zeropoints less than 0.03 mag .",
    "both the studies show that the cluster turnoff is located at v = 19 and a clump at v = 16.65 .",
    "+ according to @xcite , with a @xmath18 mag ( @xmath19 being the magnitude difference between the turnoff and the clump ) and for the derived metallicity , one would expect an age around 3.5 gyr .",
    "this preliminary estimate of the age is in fact confirmed by the isochrone fitting method . in fig .",
    "4 the solid line is a 3.3 gyr isochrone , which provides a new age estimate of 3.3@xmath40.3 gyrs for the same photometric reddening and galactocentric distance derived by @xcite . both the turnoff and the clump location are nicely reproduced .",
    "the uncertainty reflects the range of isochrones which produce an acceptable fit . + for comparison , in the same figure we over - impose a solar metallicity isochrone for the age of 2.25 gyr ( dashed line in fig .  4 ) , and for the same reddening and distance reported by @xcite .",
    "this isochrone clearly does not provide a comparable good fit . when trying to fit the turnoff , both the color of the red giant branch and the position of the clump can not be reproduced .",
    "berkeley  66 was studied by @xcite and @xcite , who suggested a reddening e(v@xmath1i)=1.60 and a metallicity in the range @xmath20 \\leq 0.0 $ ] . by assuming these values , @xcite derived a galactocentric distance of 12.9 kpc and an age of 3.5 gyrs .",
    "we obtain a significantly smaller abundance value [ fe / h]=@xmath10.48@xmath40.24 for a spectroscopic reddening of e(v@xmath1i)=1.60 , which is consistent with the @xcite estimate . by looking at the cmd ,",
    "the turnoff is situated at v = 20.75 , whereas the clump is at v = 18.25 , implying a @xmath19 of 2.5 . for this @xmath19 and the derived [ fe / h ] , the @xcite calibration yields an age of about 4.7 gry , significantly larger than previous estimate . the value [ fe / h]=@xmath10.48 tanslates into z=0.006 , and we generated a few isochrones for this exact metal abundance from @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig  5 , where a 4 and 5 gyr isochrones ( dashed and solid line , respectively ) are overimposed to the cluster cmd .",
    "both the isochrones reasonably reproduce the turnoff shape but the 5 gyr one ( solid line ) clearly presents a too bright clump . on the other hand ,",
    "the 4 gyr isochrone reproduces well all the cmd feature .",
    "this new age estimate provides a reddening e(v - i ) = 1.60 and a heliocentric distance of 5 kpc .",
    "in fig .  6 we plot the open cluster galactic radial abundance gradient , as derived from @xcite , which is at present the most updated version of the gradient itself .",
    "the clusters included in their work ( open squares ) define an overall slope of @xmath10.06@xmath40.01 dex kpc@xmath5 ( solid line ) .",
    "the filled circles represent the two clusters analyzed here , and it can be seen that they clearly follow very nicely the general trend .",
    "in fact the dashed line , which represents the radial abundance gradient determined by including berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 , basically coincides with the @xcite one .",
    "+ we note that the gradient exhibits quite a significant scatter . one may wonder whether this solely depends on observational errors , or whether this scatter reflects a true chemical inhomogeneity in the galactic disk . + it",
    "must be noted however that between 10 and 14 kpc the scatter increases and the distribution of the cluster abundances is compatible also with a flat gradient .",
    "again , it is extremely difficult to conclude whether this behaviour of the gradient is significant , or whether the distribution of abundances is mostly affected by the size of the observational errors and the small number of clusters involved .",
    "abundance ratios constitute a powerfull tool to assign a cluster to a stellar population @xcite . in paperi ( @xcite ) we found that saurer  1 and berkeley  29 exhibit enhanced abundance ratio with respect to the sun , and we concluded that they probably do not belong to the galactic disk , since all the old open cluster for which detailed abundance analysis is available show solar scaled abundance ratios . + in table  5 we list the abundance ratios for the observed stars in berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 .",
    "our program clusters have ages around 3 - 4 gyrs and iron metal content [ fe / h ] @xmath21 @xmath10.3 - 0.4 .",
    "they are therefore easily comparable with similar clusters from the literature , such as tombaugh  2 and melotte  66 ( see @xcite , tab .",
    "we note that the latter two clusters and our program clusters have scaled solar abundances . indeed , at a similar [ fe / h ] and age , berkeley  22 and melotte  66 have similar values for all the abundance ratios .",
    "+ similar conclusions can be drawn for berkeley  66 , when compared with tombaugh  2 , an old open cluster of similar age and [ fe / h ] .",
    "all the abundance ratios we could measure are comparable in these two clusters . + these results therefore indicate that berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 are two genuine old disk clusters , which well fit in the overall galactic radial abundance gradient ( see previous section ) .",
    "berkeley  22 and berkeley  66 are two similar age open clusters located roughly at symmetric positions with respect to the virtual line connecting the sun to the galactic center .",
    "in fact for berkeley  22 we derive + 5.5 , @xmath12.0 and @xmath10.8 kpc for the rectangular galactic coordinate x , y and z , respectively , while for berkeley  66 we obtain + 4 , + 2.5 and 0.01 kpc .",
    "the corresponding galactocentric distances @xmath22 are 12.7 and 14.2 kpc for berkeley  66 and berkeley  22 , respectively .",
    "+ within the errors the two clusters possess the same metal abundance , suggesting that at the distance of 12 - 14 kpc from the galactic center the metal distribution over the second and third quadrant of the galaxy is basically the same .",
    "+ it is worthwhile to point out here that only 3 clusters are insofar known to lie outside the 14 kpc - radius ring from the galactic center : berkeley  20 , berkeley  29 and saurer  1 .",
    "@xcite showed that both berkeley  29 and saurer  1 do not belong to the disk , and therefore we are probably sampling here the real outskirts of the galactic stellar disk .",
    "+ the axisymmetric homogeneity is confirmed when we add a few more old open clusters located in this strip , like ngc 1193 , ngc  2158 , ngc  2141 , berkeley  31 , tombaugh  2 and berkeley  21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all these clusters are located in the second and third quadrant , have metallicities @xmath23 \\leq -0.25 $ ] and probably belong all to the same generation ( ages between 2 and 4 gyr ) .",
    "therefore , although with a significant spread , we conclude that at 12 - 14 kpc the disk is chemically homogeneous in [ fe / h ] within the observational errors .",
    "the scatter , if real , may be due to local inhomogeneities .",
