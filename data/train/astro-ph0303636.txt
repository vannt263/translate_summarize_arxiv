    "the most appealing cosmological scenario emerged in the mid 1980s as the flat cold dark matter model with a nearly scale free initial power spectrum , characterized by a gravitational potential @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . besides the usual ingredients like baryon content @xmath9 and a present expansion rate @xmath10 , the model has only a single free parameter , namely the amplitude of initial scalar perturbations @xmath11 .",
    "however , the wealth of observational results over the past decade has forced the inclusion of an extra parameter in the form of an effective cosmological constant @xmath12 .",
    "inflation plays a crucial role in explaining the flatness and homogeneity required by the observations , as well as providing a theory of the primordial spectrum of cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "the simplest single field models of inflation @xcite predict a flat universe with primordial perturbations which slightly deviate from exact scale invariance , @xmath13 or so @xcite , while more elaborate models with more parameters can go beyond this interval .",
    "for instance in the simplest models of hybrid inflation with two fields one can have @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a long period of inflation ( with more than 65 e - folds of expansion ) generates a huge patch which is much larger than the presently observable universe .",
    "cmb experiments manifest a striking agreement with this standard cosmological model @xcite . however , an interesting result of the data , which confirms earlier cobe dmr observations , is a lower amount of power on the largest scales when compared to that predicted by the standard @xmath15cdm models @xcite .",
    "accurate monte carlo simulations of the observations indicate that only 0.7% of the realizations of the models studied in @xcite have less power than the observed quadrupole .",
    "this number , which approximates the probability of observing a smaller quadrupole than the one observed by wmap in a realization of standard @xmath15cdm model , should not be compared to the posterior probability for the theoretical quadrupole to be equal or higher to the one predicted by standard @xmath15cdm model , given the small value measured by wmap .",
    "the latter is about 5% for @xmath15cdm best fit quadrupoles ( as can be easily estimated using a @xmath16 distribution for the quadrupole ) , and the difference between the two has been the source of some confusion in the literature @xcite .",
    "cdm models , and that the value observed by cobe for the quadrupole was slightly higher than the one measured by wmap .",
    "see also  @xcite for similar interpretations of the wmap data . ]",
    "the small posterior probability for @xmath15cdm model may still be taken as a hint that some other model may provide a better fit to wmap data .",
    "one could dismiss this result by attributing it to cosmic variance .",
    "we may simply live in a patch of the universe where the low @xmath0 multipoles happens to be small , for no special reason .",
    "one may even argue that with many independent measurements ( many bins ) it would be very surprising if the results of at least one of these measurements would not deviate strongly from theoretical expectations .",
    "indeed , wmap shows several such peculiarities at various values of @xmath0",
    ". therefore it would be premature to interpret the smallness of the low multipoles as a serious problem of the standard model , particularly in light of its great success in explaining and predicting major features of our universe in great detail .",
    "indeed this is the attitude adopted by ref .",
    "@xcite who mention the `` intriguing '' smallness of the low @xmath0 multipoles , but overall interpret their results as providing a strong confirmation of the standard inflationary paradigm .",
    "however , the deficit in power observed first by cobe dmr and now by wmap is an interesting result , and it is tempting to look for possible explanations for such an effect @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss some candidates for the mechanism by which the low @xmath0 multipoles may be suppressed . in other words , we shall investigate possible modifications of the standard model which can give much better probability to have small power in low @xmath0 multipoles .",
    "we distinguish between two possibilities in suppressing the low @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "one is related to the physics of the inflationary phase in the _",
    "early universe_. theoretically we have significant freedom in the design of inflationary potentials and , consequently , in the shape of the primordial power spectra @xcite .",
    "as we will show , one can also use the freedom in choosing initial conditions at the onset of inflation .",
    "this also provides a mechanism to affect the primordial power spectra .",
    "both effects can be related through the existence of a stage when the velocity of the scalar field is not negligible , either during or prior to the observed @xmath17-e - fold stage of inflation , and hence the perturbations can not be described using the usual slow  roll parameter approximation .",
    "the drawback of this approach is clear ; it is simply a tuning of parameters to obtain a feature close to the present horizon scale .",
    "a similar problem is encountered in other attempts @xcite .    as a second option",
    ", the suppression could be due to _ late universe _",
    "physics under the influence of an effective cosmological constant .",
    "this is probably the most interesting possibility , because it relates the suppression of cmb anisotropy power at horizon scales @xmath18 to the smallness of the cosmological constant , which becomes dominant precisely at times @xmath19 .",
    "the realization of such a mechanism would then link two seemingly unrelated coincidence problems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ late ] and  [ early ] we comment on late and early universe physics effects as a cause for the suppression . in section  [ model ]",
    "we present a simple example of an inflationary model used to obtain a spectrum with a cutoff . in section  [ cmb ] we fit two separate cutoff spectra to the observations in an attempt to constrain the scale of the cutoff .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "observations of late  time acceleration and low power on largest scales challenge our simplest theoretical expectations . in both cases",
    "the effects become manifest on scales comparable to the present size of the horizon , and at a time equal to the present age of the universe .",
    "this is seen as a coincidence problem : `` why now ? '' .    indeed",
    ", cmb observations suggest that the spectrum of density perturbations is nearly flat on scales even a few times smaller than the present size of the observable universe . therefore ,",
    "if we were born @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 years after the big bang , we would see cmb anisotropies that do not display any suppression of low multipoles ( unless we were living in an unusual part of the universe due to cosmic variance ) .",
    "similarly , if we were living @xmath20 years after the big bang , the value of @xmath22 would be less than 1% .",
    "it is thus tempting to search for a physical mechanism relating these two problems .",
    "this may require a nontrivial modification of gravity at the horizon scale .",
    "for example , it would be appealing to have a mechanism that would screen not only the cosmological constant @xcite , but also inhomogeneities on the scale @xmath23 , on which the effects of the cosmological constant become manifest .",
    "another idea is related to possible nonperturbative effects due to eternal inflation .",
    "for example , under certain assumptions concerning the choice of measure in the theory of eternal inflation , one can come to a paradoxical conclusion that we should live in a center of a spherically symmetric distribution of matter @xcite .",
    "this could lead to suppression of the large - angle anisotropy without affecting the small - angle effects .    however , these possibilities are very speculative . as a simpler alternative",
    "one may investigate whether the late time evolution of the metric fluctuations @xmath24 could be responsible for the suppression via the integral sachs ",
    "wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "the observed large ",
    "angle cmb temperature anisotropies are generated by scalar perturbations to the frw geometry , which in the longitudinal gauge can be written as @xmath25 the anisotropy has a contribution of @xmath26 sources at the last scattering time hypersurface @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , an integral contribution arises , in the case where time derivative @xmath28 is non - vanishing . here",
    "@xmath29 denotes the scale factor , @xmath30 the conformal time , and a prime denotes differentiation wrt @xmath30 .",
    "consider a scale free primordial spectrum @xmath31 .",
    "then , for the cmb angular power spectrum amplitudes we can adopt the result of @xcite @xmath32 where the coefficient @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 ^ 2 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is @xmath36 normalized to @xmath37 .",
    "the flat cdm model gives @xmath38 and @xmath39 at large scales .",
    "the flat @xmath15cdm model with pure cosmological constant @xmath40 gives instead @xmath41 , amplifying the power above the sachs ",
    "wolfe plateau @xcite .    however , the coefficients @xmath42 may be smaller than unity with particular solutions for the late time evolution of @xmath24 .",
    "this can be realized if the interference between the two terms in the integral  ( [ coeff ] ) is destructive , which in turn constrains the spectrum and evolution of the metric perturbation @xmath43 .",
    "this may require special models of the effective cosmological constant , or the addition of isocurvature fluctuations in the quintessence field  @xcite .",
    "we will address these possibilities in a future investigation .",
    "here we will describe modifications of the simplest inflationary models that can account for the suppression of the low @xmath0 multipoles .",
    "as we will see , these modifications have a common cause , which is the presence of a primordial or intermediate regime where some of the slow roll approximations are not valid ( without necessarily meaning the interruption of inflation ) .",
    "this results in a departure from the slow roll approximation when one evaluates the power spectrum originated during inflation .",
    "there have been many suggestions in the past on how to alter the amplitude of density perturbations produced during inflation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the simplest idea is to fine - tune the shape of the potential . in general , this procedure is far from being trivial .",
    "the amplitude of metric perturbations at the horizon crossing in the slow - roll approximation is given by @xmath44 where in the r.h.s .",
    "@xmath45 is a function of @xmath46 through @xmath47 , we use the units @xmath48 , and @xmath49 denotes the derivative wrt @xmath50 . this formula is convenient to gain a heuristic insight of the problem .",
    "once we start bending the potential , change occurs both in @xmath51 and in @xmath52 , and the relation between @xmath50 and the momentum @xmath46 of perturbations changes as well .    to do so , one does not have to use complicated potentials .",
    "one can use , for instance , the simple generic renormalizable potential @xmath53 by an appropriate choice of parameters we can generate significant features  dips or peaks  in the spectrum , as demonstrated in @xcite with exact solutions of the gauge invariant mode - by - mode equations for fluctuations . obviously , we must tune the parameters to place the dip of the power spectrum @xmath54 around the present day cosmological horizon .",
    "the situation is even simpler in the hybrid inflation scenario , which has more parameters by construction .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is mainly determined by the cosmological constant @xmath55 that does not change significantly during inflation . in this case , in order to make the amplitude of the potential smaller ( greater ) one should simply increase ( decrease ) the slope of the potential .",
    "suppose , for example , that we have @xmath56 ( as we should ) in the theory where the potential looks like @xmath57 at low @xmath50 , corresponding to the number of e - folds @xmath58 .",
    "suppose also that at larger @xmath50 the slope gradually increases and becomes 10 times greater on the scale corresponding to @xmath59 . then on this scale",
    "the amplitude of perturbations will become 10 times smaller .",
    "this should lead to a primordial spectrum @xmath54 with an amplitude which is strongly suppressed at low @xmath46 , which will give us a desirable effect in the cmb anisotropy .",
    "again , this requires some fine - tuning of the position of the place where the slope of the potential changes .",
    "an analogous spectrum was found in @xcite through a numerical mode - by - mode computation in the model @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , potentials of this type naturally appear in the simplest versions of hybrid inflation in supergravity ( f - term inflation @xcite ) .",
    "if one considers n=1 supergravity with a minimal khler potential and a very simple superpotential @xmath61 , one finds a potential of the following general form @xcite : @xmath62    note that the potential is steep at small and at large @xmath50 , and relatively flat for some intermediate values of @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to the cutoff of the spectrum at very short distances , as well as on the very large scale .",
    "a similar behavior was advocated in @xcite based on the wmap data and lss@xmath63 data . for certain natural values of parameters",
    "the infrared cutoff of the spectrum occurs on the scale of the horizon .",
    "this is exactly what one needs to explain the suppression of the low @xmath0 multipoles of cmb .",
    "it is usually assumed that the inflaton scalar field is moving very slowly at the beginning of inflation .",
    "this picture goes back to the early days of inflationary paradigm , when the field was supposed to be trapped in the minimum of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "therefore the initial speed of the field was supposed to be zero . in the language of density perturbations , @xmath64",
    ", this implied that the density perturbations produced at the beginning of inflation were very large , in complete agreement with the usual statement that the spectrum of density perturbations in simplest one - field inflationary models is red .",
    "however , in chaotic inflation @xcite the initial speed of the field @xmath50 can be quite large .",
    "the field eventually slows down when it approaches the inflationary regime , which is an attractor in the phase space of all possible trajectories @xmath65 . for a small subset of initial conditions the field may approach the inflationary trajectory relatively late , so that at the onset of the last 65 e - folds of inflation the field will have higher speed than is usually expected . in this case",
    "the amplitude of metric perturbations at the scale of the horizon will be smaller than expected , which in turn will result in a lower variance of cmb anisotropies at small @xmath0 .",
    "this marginal inflation requires a tuning of the initial conditions , and not of the shape of the potential .",
    "a similar situation may occur in hybrid inflation .",
    "the simplest potential for two - field hybrid inflation is @xcite @xmath66 the point where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a bifurcation point . for @xmath69",
    "the squares of the effective masses of both fields @xmath70 and @xmath71 are positive and the potential has a minimum at @xmath68 . for @xmath72",
    "the potential has a maximum at @xmath68 .",
    "the global minimum is located at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "inflation in this model occurs while the @xmath50 field rolls slowly from large values toward the bifurcation point .",
    "the space of initial conditions now is @xmath75 . in general evolution",
    "begins with large values of @xmath50 and @xmath76 , at the boundary with planck energy density . at large @xmath50",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath77 is given by the term @xmath78 , so the planck boundary is given by a set of four hyperbole @xcite @xmath79 we will assume that initially @xmath80 and take @xmath81 .",
    "the field @xmath50 on this branch can take any value up to @xmath82 ( for greater values of @xmath50 the field @xmath76 would have a super - planckian mass @xmath83 ) .",
    "suppose for definiteness that @xmath84 is close to its upper bound , so that the initial value of the field @xmath76 at the planck boundary is of order @xmath85 or somewhat greater .",
    "this allows for a short stage of chaotic inflation supported by the potential of the field @xmath76 when this field rolls down toward @xmath86 .",
    "after the first stage of inflation , the field @xmath76 rapidly oscillates , with the frequency just slightly smaller than the planck mass , and with the amplitude @xmath87 decreasing as @xmath88 .",
    "the oscillations induce a large contribution to the effective mass of the field @xmath50 : @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 stays either for the average square of the amplitude of the oscillations of the field , or for the fluctuations of this field produced during its decay to particles @xmath50 and @xmath76 .    in the beginning ,",
    "@xmath91 , so the field moves with a much greater speed than what one could naively expect by looking at the effective potential of the field @xmath50 and ignoring its interactions with the field @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a strong suppression of density perturbations produced at the first stages of hybrid inflation .",
    "however , eventually the term @xmath92 drops down and we enter the standard hybrid inflation regime producing perturbations with nearly flat spectrum .",
    "since the term @xmath93 drops down very rapidly , as @xmath94 , the transition between the flat spectrum produced at late stages of inflation and the strongly suppressed spectrum at the early stages of inflation occurs very abruptly , within a single e - fold of inflation .",
    "this is exactly what we want in order to explain the absence of the low @xmath0 multipoles .    in terms of the slow roll parameters",
    "@xmath95 , @xmath96 , one has @xmath97 . ,",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath98 , etc . , given in terms the inflaton potential and its derivatives .",
    "for our purposes however , it is convenient to keep the original parameters given in the text . ]",
    "suppression of the spectrum at small @xmath46 implies that @xmath99 , is large for @xmath46 corresponding to the scale of the present horizon .",
    "this means that in our examples some of the slow - roll parameters @xmath100 , etc .",
    ", at some early ( or intermediate ) stage of inflation were large .",
    "this can be attributed to the time derivatives @xmath101 , @xmath102 , etc .",
    "thus , departure from the slow roll approximation for calculating power spectrum is related to the regime where kinetic terms can not be neglected .",
    "we would like to mention also , that there is a new possibility of modulated cosmological perturbations from inflation @xcite , where one may use a different type of tuning to get desirable spectra from inflation , while leaving the inflaton potential unchanged .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we now study in a more detailed way one of the simplest possibilities we have discussed above , namely the existence of a period of fast rolling of the inflaton field @xmath50 ( with strong kinetic domination ) before the last stage of inflation .",
    "the period of inflation is assumed to last for about @xmath103 e - folds ( the exact length depending on the details of reheating ) such that the stage of fast roll can leave an imprint precisely at the largest scales we presently observe . as a working assumption ,",
    "we start with a homogeneous and flat universe already at the stage of fast roll , so that one may have to postulate the existence of a previous period of inflation at earlier times . apart for this requirement",
    ", we leave the details of the earlier universe unspecified , and we rather concentrate on the evolution of the background and of the cosmological perturbations starting from the fast roll regime .",
    "we are mainly interested in the spectrum of primordial perturbations .",
    "we first perform an exact mode - by - mode numerical computation in the context of chaotic inflationary potential and large initial velocity for the inflaton field .",
    "we will then compute the spectrum in a simpler idealized situation , with an instantaneous transition between a regime of kinetic domination and a nearly de - sitter stage . in this last case one",
    "can derive a simple analytical result which reproduces very well the exact spectrum obtained in the numerical evolution .",
    "we start with a quadratic inflaton potential , @xmath104 , and initial conditions @xmath105 , giving about @xmath106 e - folds of inflation . concerning the perturbations , we work in momentum space and focus on the mukhanov variable @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the perturbations in the inflaton field , @xmath24 is the metric perturbation given in eq .",

    "fit models . for @xmath169",
    "we find that the probability of exceeding the observed @xmath16 is 5.6% in the case of the standard model , 21.7% when using the template model cutoff , and 33.4% with the exponential cutoff of eq .",
    "[ cutoff ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we marginalize over the range in @xmath12 with a gaussian prior @xmath170 and plot the resulting @xmath16 values as a function of @xmath151 and cutoff scale @xmath5 .",
    "the contours shown are for @xmath171 values giving one , two , and three @xmath76 contours for two parameter gaussian distributions .",
    "we find that the distribution for the cutoff scale has a tail as @xmath172 close to the @xmath4 level .",
    "this is evident from the fact that the models asymptotically approach the scale invariant case which has a low but not vanishing probability with respect to the observations @xcite .",
    "the data however prefer a cutoff scale within the present observable universe at the @xmath165 level .",
    "finally we marginalize over @xmath151 with a flat prior to obtain the marginalized probability distribution in @xmath5 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . as the distributions do not vanish as @xmath172 we integrate the functions in the range @xmath173 to obtain 68% and 95% confidence limits . for the inflation model",
    "we find @xmath174mpc@xmath2 with a 95% upper limit of @xmath175mpc@xmath2 .",
    "similarly for the exponential cutoff model we find @xmath1mpc@xmath2 with a 95% upper limit of @xmath3mpc@xmath2 .",
    "it is important to note that the confidence limits depend on the integration measure adopted . in this case",
    "we have taken a measure linear in @xmath5 ; however an alternative would be to take a measure in @xmath6 which may be more suitable for the distribution of the cutoff scales given by inflation theories .",
    "this second option , which gives higher weights to lower wavenumbers , will crucially depend on the value chosen for the largest scales , @xmath176 .",
    "in the context of inflationary models it is natural to limit to those scales which left the horizon when the energy density of the universe was close to planckian .",
    "when faced with such ambiguities it is useful to refer to the difference in likelihoods between different values of @xmath5 .",
    "this allows an approximate estimate of the significance of having a cutoff without depending on any measure used in deriving confidence limits . as an example",
    "the difference in @xmath16 between the peak in the distributions and at @xmath177 is found to be @xmath178 for the exponential cutoff and @xmath179 for the inflation model .",
    "this indicates that the case with no cutoff is just over @xmath4 below our best ",
    "fit cutoff model .",
    "both cobe dmr and observations indicate a low value for the power on largest scales .",
    "interestingly , these scales are of the same order as the scale corresponding to the time of dominance of the cosmological constant .",
    "if one ignores the possible interpretation of the suppression of low multipoles due to cosmic variance ( which is perhaps the simplest and the least dramatic interpretation ) , one faces a new coincidence problem in addition to the usual one required to explain the late  time acceleration of the universe ( i.e. @xmath180 today ) . in this paper",
    "we briefly discussed the possibility that the late  time evolution of the metric perturbations @xmath181 may reduce the power in the low multipoles through integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect .",
    "this may require a combined investigation of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations in certain models of dark energy .",
    "the main emphasis of our paper was related to modifications of the simplest models of inflation due to the possible existence of a kinetic stage , when the velocity of the scalar field was not negligible .",
    "the breaking of the slow roll approximation which could occur at this stage may cause a significant suppression of the large scale density perturbations . in order to affect the low @xmath0 multipoles",
    ", this stage should occur in the beginning of the last @xmath17 e - fold period of inflation .",
    "clearly , this requires either fine tuning of parameters in the inflaton potential , or fine - tuning of initial conditions which are necessary to obtain a desirable modification of the spectrum close to the present horizon scale .    the final part of the paper has the aim to quantify with a simple example the level of suppression required by the data . a stage of kinetic domination before the observable stage of inflation can result in a sharp cutoff in the spectrum of primordial perturbations",
    ".    fits to the observations reveal that the data favour a cutoff in the spectrum although the significance of the `` detection '' is less than @xmath182 .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the @xmath177 case ( i.e. standard @xmath15cdm model ) is not a terrible fit to the data .",
    "the price of obtaining a better fit is the addition of an extra parameter in the theory which should probably be done under stronger observational evidence than we currently have .    on the other hand",
    ", we should note that when we attempt to evaluate all possible theories that could produce the required suppression of the spectrum , we consider the space of all possible cutoff parameters equally distributed in momentum space .",
    "meanwhile if we would assume equal prior distribution in space of parameters of inflationary models , this would translate into an approximately equal distribution in terms of @xmath183 rather than @xmath46 .",
    "this remark also applies to other attempts to explain the suppression of low multipoles @xcite and constitutes a choice of prior on @xmath5 a problem encountered when constraining many of the cosmological parameters ( e.g. a choice of uniform prior on @xmath10 as opposed to in @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , as we have discussed , a possibly less ambiguous quantity is the likelihood ratio between different values of the cutoff since this does not depend on any underlying theoretical distribution .",
    "we have quantified this in the previous section .",
    "we should also bear in mind that in any case , observations tell us the values of the parameters , and we should accept them even if they seem unusually fine  tuned . for example , many coupling constants in the standard theory of electroweak interactions are of the order @xmath184 .",
    "meanwhile the coupling constant of the electron and the higgs field , which is responsible for the electron mass , is @xmath185 .",
    "the smallness of this parameter is notable , but usually we do not assume that all coupling constants are random variables and do not calculate the probability to have such a small coupling constant on the basis of its comparison to other coupling constants in the theory . we still do not know why this coupling constant is so incredibly small , but it does not make the standard theory of electroweak interactions unacceptable . moreover , according to the standard model , the neutrino must be massless , meanwhile the recent data suggest that this is not the case .",
    "this means that we need to extend the standard model by making it even more complicated .",
    "however , this does not cast any doubts concerning the basic idea of gauge invariance and spontaneous symmetry breaking , which made the electroweak theory internally consistent",
    ".    high energy physicists never claim that they fine - tune the parameters of the theory , they simply fit the data . until very recently cosmologists did not need to do the same and had the luxury to debate which values of the parameters seemed more natural .",
    "we are now entering the age of precision cosmology , and we need to adjust our attitude accordingly .    during the last 20 years , the inflationary scenario emerged as the simplest and possibly even unique way of constructing an internally consistent cosmological theory .",
    "the main result of our paper is that , if needed , we can fit the parameters of the inflationary theory and make it consistent with the small amplitude of the large - angle anisotropy of the cmb .",
    "it is incomparably easier to do so than to explain all features of the spectrum of the cmb , as well as the observed homogeneity , isotropy and flatness of the universe without using inflation .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank dick bond , juan garcia - bellido , mark halpern , johannes martin , dmitri pogosyan , david spergel , max tegmark , and david wands for helpful discussions .",
