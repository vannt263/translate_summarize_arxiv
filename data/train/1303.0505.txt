    ", they can be divided into two subclasses , the z sources with near eddington luminosity ( @xmath2 ) and the atoll sources with much lower luminosity ( @xmath3 ) . the color - color diagram ( cd ) and hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) of z source have three branches , from top to bottom , which are so - called the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the normal branch ( nb ) and the flare branch ( fb ) @xcite , respectively",
    ". however , the cds / hids of atoll sources are obviously different from those of the z sources .",
    "a cd / hid of atoll sources also have three branches , the extreme island state , the island state , and the banana state . usually , a complete track of the z sources last from hours to days , whereas atoll sources last from weeks to months .",
    "in terms of the orientation of branches , the z sources are classified into the cyg - like z sources ( , and ) with a horizontal hb (  z \"- shaped tracks ) and the sco - like z sources ( , , and ) with a vertical hb (  @xmath4\"-shaped tracks ) .",
    "the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm was applied in order to obtain the power density spectra ( pds ) of lmxbs . in some z sources ( , , , , and so on ) , the hb quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) signals , which vary with frequencies in range from 13 hz to 55 hz ,",
    "are observed in the power spectra .",
    "almost all z sources have 5 - 7 hz qpo on nb and few of them have @xmath5 hz qpo on fb .",
    "the radiation hydrodynamic model @xcite was proposed to explain the @xmath0 6 hz nbos . in this model ,",
    "the nbos of z sources arise from the optical depth oscillation of in - flowing medium near the neutron star scatting by the outgoing x - ray flux .",
    "this model also explained a minimum in the nbo rms amplitude spectrum when the phase lag spectrum showed @xmath6 phase jump . in , a @xmath7 phase jump was observed around 6 kev , which was defined as pivot energy @xcite .",

    ", the time lags of nbo nearly remained 50 ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . for the hb / nb vertex regions in the z sources , the time lag increased with the source intensity decreased , which is the trend of accretion rate decreased .    in order to explain the observed time lag in compact star system(e.g .",
    ", bh- , ns - lmxbs , agns , and so on ) , many models are proposed , including the shot model @xcite , the propagation of accretion fluctuations model @xcite , and the comptonization models @xcite .",
    "the shot model mathematically explained the observed power spectra in lmxbs @xcite , the soft lag in the low frequency noise @xcite and the hard lag in the hbo simultaneously @xcite .",
    "it regarded the hbo as the signature of intensity modulation and the low frequency noise as the power spectral signature of shots , when the accretion matter fall onto the neutron star surface .",
    "the observed soft lag of low frequency noise could be interpreted if the shot envelopes in the soft energy band lag those in the hard energy band . meanwhile , the hard lag in the hbo may originate from a particular delaying of the qpo production in high energy band without distinctly interfering by low frequency noise .",
    "the time lag in the hard state of bh - lmxbs which displays hard lag in low frequency noise shows the exactly opposite to our results @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the hard state time lag in the cyg x-1 and found that the energy dependence of hard lag in low frequency noise as well as the hard lag increase with decreasing low fourier frequency .",
    "it seems contradictory to the uniform and compact comptonization corona model .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the observed hard lag in gx 339 - 4 corresponds to the viscous propagation of mass accretion instabilities through the disk .",
    "the emission of bh - lmxbs contains two parts , the power law dominant in the high energy band and the disk black body dominant in the low energy band . when the mass accretion fluctuations happened , the variabilities of disk black body emission lead to the power law emission variations on time scales of seconds .",
    "if the low frequency noise comes from these two components variations , then the hard lag appears . for the soft lag",
    ", it may be responsible by the power law illuminating the black body on time scales of milliseconds , where the the power law emission regions locate about tens of @xmath44 to the disk .    however , xte j1701 - 462 shows more complicated emission mechanism than bh - lmxbs @xcite . on the hb",
    ", the energy spectral of xte j1701 - 462 is composed of the multi - color black body from the disk , the black body from the ns surface and the cutoff power law from the corona above the disk , which dominate the emission in several kev , tens of kev and the hard tail respectively . on the nb and fb , the cutoff power law component becomes too faint to be detected .",
    "we indicate that there exist three possible lag mechanisms , the compton upscattering by the corona @xcite , the propagation of the accretion rate instabilities in the disk @xcite and the disk illuminating by the black body from the ns surface in xte j1701 - 462 .",
    "however , the soft lag introduced by the ns x - ray illuminating is likely the time scale of light travel from the ns to the disk , which is too low ( @xmath45 ) compared to our calculations .",
    "the propagation of the accretion rate instabilities in the disk only produce hard lag in low frequency noise which is not conform to the soft lag in xte j1701 - 462 .    the uniform comptonization models @xcite can not interpret the energy dependence of hard time lag and soft time lags in lmxbs . in order to explain soft lags and time lags evolution of qpos , a comptonization model with two - layer corona was proposed @xcite .",
    "when photons pass through the two - layer corona , the photons encounter the inverse compton scattering by hot electrons and gain energy .",
    "if the inner layer is hot and optical depth is @xmath46 , the hard photons are scattering more than the soft photons and the hard time lags observed .",
    "if the inner layer is optical thick , the photons are efficiently upscattered .",
    "when the harder photons pass through the out part corona with lower temperature , they will lose energy and the soft lags appear .",
    "@xcite explained that the accretion rate changing along branches leads to the time lag evolution . from multiwavelength campaigns of cyg x-2 ,",
    "the monotonically increasing in @xmath33 from the hb , via the nb , to the fb was reported @xcite .",
    "if the accretion rate of xte j1701 - 462 arise from the hb to the nb , the hot electrons in the inner layer corona are cooled by photons from the disk .",
    "this process will shrink the inner lay corona and the observed hbo time lags become smaller .",
    "lin and co - workers @xcite concluded that the accretion rate did not vary significantly along the z tracks but did along secular change , i.e. @xmath33 decrease from the z source to an atoll source . the time lag - qpo relation of the hb / nb vertex",
    "could be explained by the accretion rate decreasing ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 - 1 ] )",
    ". however , for the time lags evolution on the hb of xte j1701 - 462 , when the source intensity increased , the disk luminosity which was mainly contributed by comptonization ascended simultaneously ( see fig .",
    "20 in @xcite ) .",
    "when the luminosity of the disk component increases from the up turn to the hb / nb vertex , the temperature of the inner layer corona cool down through compton emission and then lead to a smaller radius layer . because the photons contributing to the hbo came from the disk , the time lags of hbo decrease as a function of @xmath28 was also observed . in a z track ,",
    "the time lag of hbo increasing towards high source intensity can be explained by the accretion rate increasing and the comptonization component variations . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggested an opposite accretion rate increasing direction , i.e. , from the nb to the hb , which could not reasonably explain the time lags evolution of xte j1701 - 462 .",
    "the near-180@xmath47 phase lag and the dip in rms amplitude spectrum were observed in and , but did not show in .",
    "@xcite provided two explanations for the nbos behavior for and and .",
    "firstly , they may have different viewing angle .",
    "secondly , with the radiation - hydrodynamic model for the qpos , the qpo of and are determined by optical depth oscillations while the qpos of are determined by luminosity variation , where the ns of has a weaker magnetic field .",
    "changes from a cyg - like z source , via a sco - like z source , to an atoll source in two years . the binary inclination and the strength of the ns magnetic field",
    "are invariant on such a short timescale @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate dominates the whole processes .",
    "we found near-160@xmath47 phase lag of nbos both in cyg - like phase and sco - like phase which are consistent with and .",
    "however , no pivot energy in rms amplitude spectrum was observed in the cyg - like phase . this can not be explained by the radiation - hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpreted that the nbo and the rms energy dependence in sco x-1 originate from the transition layer .",
    "the similar behaviors of time lag spectrum and rms amplitude spectrum between the cyg - like sources and the sco - like sources indicate that the nbos are irrelevant to the luminosity variation in .",
    "we investigated the cross sprctral and the qpos for the cyg - like phase and the sco - like phase of xte j1701 - 462 . the qpos increase from 12 hz to 53 hz on the hb and remain @xmath48 hz on the nb .",
    "these consist with other z sources .",
    "we also computed the time lags and hbos for the hb / nb vertexes ( interval i - iv ) .",
    "the two - layer corona comptonization model can explain the soft lag in low frequency noise and hard lag in hbo respectively .",
    "both the accretion increasing and the comptonization component variation can produce the hbos time lag evolution . for a ns - lmxb , we could not deduce its accretion rate increasing direction along branches in the hid only from the time lag variation .",

    "<S> we investigate the cross spectrum of xte j1701 - 462 in various types of neutron star - low mass x - ray binary subclasses , during its 2006 - 2007 outburst . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the relation between the time lags and temporal variabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the hard time lags accompany with the horizontal branch oscillations ( hbos ) and the soft time lags dominate the noise in the low frequency range 0.1 - 10 hz on hb . in the cyg - like phase , </S>",
    "<S> the time lags decrease on the middle normal branch ( nb ) from hb / nb vertex to nb / fb vertex , whereas the time lags are roughly invariant in the sco - like source . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss that the compton upscattering by the corona introduces the soft lag in low frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret that the variation of the comptonization component from the disk emission lead to the hbos time lags evolution along the z tracks . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the rms amplitude spectrum and phase lag spectrum for the nbo . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 @xmath1 phase lag is found . </S>",
    "<S> we present that the rms amplitude of both the cyg - like and the sco - like nbo linearly increase with the photon energy in low energy bands , and it will drop in the highest energy band . </S>"
