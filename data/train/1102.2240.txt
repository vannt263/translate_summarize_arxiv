    "the magnitude cross - correlations show a power law decay with time lag , and the scaling exponent is 0.25 . the result we obtain , that at the world level the cross - correlations between the magnitudes are long - range , is potentially significant because it implies that strong market crashes introduced at one place have an extended duration elsewhere  which is `` bad news '' for international investment managers who imagine that diversification across countries reduces risk .",

    "<S> a significant fraction of the world index cross - correlations can be explained by the global factor , which supports the utility of the gfm . </S>",

    "<S> we find 10 indices are practically uncorrelated with the global factor and with the remainder of the world indices , which is relevant information for world managers in reducing their portfolio risk . finally , we argue that this general method can be applied to a wide range of phenomena in which time series are measured , ranging from seismology and physiology to atmospheric geophysics . </S>"
