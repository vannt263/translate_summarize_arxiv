    "although known since the 1930 s as one of the elementary decay channels of exited nuclear states with transition energies of more than @xmath14mev @xcite , only limited theoretical and very limited experimental investigations of this process have been carried out in the following years .",
    "theoretical results concerning the angular correlation of the @xmath0- pairs were mainly based on born approximation and thus valid only for point - like low-@xmath15 nuclei and/or transition energies much higher than the threshold of 1.022mev @xcite . only in the early 1990 s more theoretical effort yielded results valid also for finite size nuclei and low transition energies ( below twice the threshold ) at least for electrical multipole transitions @xcite .",
    "correct treatment of magnetic transitions was achieved only recently @xcite , and the results for angular correlations are presented here .",
    "very few experimental results on ipc are published , and most of them on total ipc coefficients only , derived from the integral @xmath16yield @xcite . however , one very early experiment @xcite already measured the angular correlation for the 6mev e1 transition in @xmath17 , but without any energy measurement .",
    "this and other transitions of even higher energies in light nuclei have been measured recently @xcite both energy and angle resolved .",
    "the results were in reasonable agreement with born approximation , as expected , since this approximation should be valid for these cases .",
    "however , @xmath0-pairs emitted via ipc from heavy nuclei are of considerable interest , since ipc is the only known source of @xmath0-pairs with a sharp sum energy .",
    "narrow lines with sum energies ( @xmath18 ) in the range @xmath19 have been found in heavy - ion experiments around the coulomb barrier at gsi @xcite .",
    "the angular correlation of the emitted leptons is of particular interest , since the response of the various setups depends strongly on it .",
    "prior to this work , no data have been available .",
    "additionally , the most recent theoretical results shown below should be tested experimentally .",
    "the angular correlation of electron - positron pairs emitted by internal pair conversion ( multipolarity @xmath20 ) can be expressed in terms of legendre polynomials @xcite    @xmath21    the differential pair conversion coefficient @xmath22 and the anisotropy coefficients @xmath23 are calculated numerically .",
    "the calculation is performed using dwba , i.e. , the electron and positron wave functions are taken to be the exact scattering solutions of the dirac equation for the coulomb potential of an extended nucleus @xcite .",
    "the differential pair conversion coefficient and the anisotropy coefficients depend therefore on the nuclear charge number , as well as on the nuclear transition energy and the multipolarity and parity of the nuclear transition .",
    "thus , the calculation goes beyond the born approximation , where electron and positron wave functions are considered as plane waves @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 is also tabulated in @xcite .",
    "1 shows the angular correlation for m1 pair conversion of an lead nucleus ( @xmath24 ) and a transition energy of @xmath25  mev .",
    "the energy difference @xmath26 amounts to @xmath27  kev , which corresponds to the experimental data presented in this work ( see fig .",
    "10 below ) .",
    "the calculation was performed assuming a point - like nucleus ( dashed curve ) as well as an extended nucleus ( full curve ) .",
    "the point nucleus approximation is not very realistic for magnetic pair conversion in highly - charged nuclei since it overestimates the pair emission rate .",
    "finally the dotted curve corresponds to the result obtained within the plane wave born approximation @xcite , which displays the typical forward - peaked behaviour previously expected for the pair emission . for high nuclear charge numbers ,",
    "the angular correlation deviates strongly from the born approximation result .",
    "the pair emission occurs then nearly isotropic .",
    "this behaviour is elucidated by fig .",
    "2 , which depicts the angular correlation , assuming a @xmath25  mev m1 transition with symmetric splitting of the transition energy on the electron and the positron and various nuclear charge numbers .",
    "also in the case of electric monopole pair conversion ( denoted as e0 pair conversion ) the angular correlation deviates from the born approximation result if one takes full account of the nuclear charge number @xcite .",
    "the angular correlation is then written as @xmath28 again the differential pair conversion coefficient @xmath29 and the anisotropy coefficient @xmath30 are computed numerically by employing the scattering solutions of the dirac equation and assuming an extended nucleus . using these coulomb - distorted plane waves @xcite internal pair conversion results in a strong dependence on the nuclear charge number . in fig .",
    "3 the anisotropy coefficient is plotted versus the kinetic positron energy for the @xmath31  mev e0 transition in zr ( @xmath32 ) ( full curve ) and u ( @xmath33 ) ( dotted curve ) .",
    "if the nuclear charge number is increased the angular correlation starts to deviate from the born approximation result @xcite ( dashed curve ) and becomes more isotropic .",
    "as in the heavy - ion experiments @xcite , we use two identical iron - free , orange - type @xmath6- spectrometers  @xcite , facing each other with a common object point , at which a target wheel is placed ( fig .",
    "4 ) . positrons ( @xmath16 ) emitted in the backward ( @xmath34 ) and electrons ( @xmath35 ) emitted in the forward hemisphere ( @xmath36 ) are focussed onto the corresponding lepton detectors .",
    "each lepton detector consists of an array of high - resolution si pin diodes , called pagoda .",
    "intrinsic to this setup is the capability of focussing , at a given field setting , only a certain momentum interval of @xmath16 or @xmath35 by rejecting the opposite charge .",
    "this is of major advantage because the high @xmath7 background is suppressed completely on the @xmath16side , while the selection of only a certain band of @xmath35-momenta on the @xmath35side enables operation with the strong sources required by the low branching ratios .",
    "the leptons are identified by matching their momentum , derived from the hit - point on the pagoda and the spectrometer field setting , with their energy , measured by the pin diodes .",
    "this efficiently suppresses backgrounds due to @xmath8 rays .",
    "an additional coincidence requirement with the 511  kev annihilation radiation is thus not necessary for the @xmath16 identification .",
    "the momentum - energy matching in addition rejects the @xmath37 leptons backscattered from the pin diodes almost completely , a unique feature of this setup . as mentioned above , for the lepton identification only events for which the energy - momentum relation is fulfilled are accepted , with the result that the remaining lepton misidentification is small and",
    "can be determined reliably .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "5 for the case of the positron identification . as can be seen a clear signature for the focussed positrons is obtained .",
    "in such a spectrum all other particles , like electrons and @xmath8 rays scattered from the vacuum vessel walls and the spectrometer coils as well as positrons backscattered from the detectors , result in a broad continuous background distribution which can be determined quantitatively .",
    "the situation is very similar for the case of the electron identification .",
    "each of the two identical lepton detection systems consists of 72 segmented , high - resolution , 1 mm thick , si- pin diodes which are mounted on 12 roofs , 6 detectors on each roof ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . each detector chip has a trapezoidal shape ( 24 mm base , 16 mm top , and 16 mm height ) which is tilted by @xmath38 relative to the spectrometer axis .",
    "each detector is also subdivided into three electrically separated sectors , each covering an azimuthal angular range of @xmath39 = @xmath40 . a matrix readout , each roof as well as each three neighboring sectors at the same azimuthal angle to one preamplifier , records information on energy and arrival time of a lepton hitting a detector . cooling the detectors to @xmath41c ,",
    "the e@xmath42e@xmath43-sum - energy and time resolution achieved amounts to @xmath4415 kev and @xmath444 ns ( fwhm ) , respectively .",
    "the opening angle of the @xmath0pair , @xmath9 , is measured directly within a range of @xmath45 in the laboratory .",
    "using the @xmath46separation of the pagoda s , this range can be subdivided into ten angular bins ( see table 1 ) with centroids in the range @xmath9  =  70@xmath47  167@xmath47 .",
    "these angular bins cover the same solid angle of 0.62sr@xmath48 , except the first and last , which cover only half of this value .",
    "this is due to simple combinatorics : for each of the angular bins all combinations between @xmath16  and @xmath35  pagoda columns with the same @xmath49 are put together . for @xmath49=0@xmath50  and 180@xmath50",
    "only one column on the other pagoda contributes , but for e.g.  @xmath49=20@xmath50 both signs are possible and two columns of the other pagoda contribute to this @xmath9-bin .",
    "the values given in table  1 have been calculated via a monte carlo simulation , which takes into account a realistic source spot size and the shadowing of the coils via ray tracing . the same code , but extended to handle the angular correlation of the emitted pairs , small - angle scattering and energy loss in the source , was also used for results shown later in this paper .",
    "each pagoda array covers a maximum momentum acceptance of @xmath51 = 30% which corresponds to an energy interval of @xmath52150 kev at a lepton energy of 300 kev . within this momentum interval ,",
    "the full - energy peak efficiency is 10% and 11% of 4@xmath53 , for electrons and positrons , respectively ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to cover an area in the @xmath54-@xmath11  plane larger than given by the momentum acceptance of the spectrometers ,",
    "the spectrometer currents are stepped up and down in a correlated manner , where each step is done after the same live - time interval .",
    "thus an intrinsic correction for dead time effects due to different count rates is achieved .    under the assumption , that the @xmath55-dependant longitudinal dispersion of the spectrometers cancels , the pair detection efficiency of the double - orange setup can be written as follows :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the detection efficiency of the spectrometers for isotropic emission , depending on energy distribution and spectrometer current sweep , and @xmath58 depends on the angular correlation of the leptons .",
    "however , for any given angular correlation , the relative number of counts in every angular bin of the setup does not depend on energy distribution or spectrometer fields .",
    "the angular correlation can thus be deduced from the relative intensities alone .",
    "the above mentioned assumption is justified , if leptons entering the spectrometers at any accepted angle @xmath55 from the axis and passing the spectrometer will hit any of the pagoda s detectors . for a given",
    ", fixed spectrometer current this is true for the flat top of the efficiency of @xmath59 . at the edges of the flat top",
    "the efficiency drops fast to zero , and the efficiency in this case depends on @xmath55 . when the spectrometers are used in current sweep mode , the flat top region is extended over the whole acceptance range covered , and a @xmath55 dependance is present only at the steep edges .",
    "with the setup described above we investigated the 1.76mev e0 transition in @xmath2  and the 1.77mev m1 transition in @xmath4 , using radioactive sources .      the first excited @xmath60 state at 1.76mev of the @xmath60 nucleus @xmath2  is forbidden for normal @xmath8 decay and it s main decay channels are internal conversion , emitting electrons with sharp energy given by the transition energy minus the @xmath35  binding energy ( @xmath61 ) and internal pair conversion ( @xmath62 ) emission .",
    "the strongest of these branches emits two @xmath8 s back to back @xcite .",
    "there is even a report of a very weak single - gamma branch @xcite , made possible by coupling to the atomic shell electrons ] , emitting @xmath0-pairs with sharp sum energy given by the transition energy minus the equivalent of the pair s mass .",
    "the sum energy is thus @xmath63kev@xmath64kev=738kev .",
    "this energy can be shared arbitrarily between @xmath35  and @xmath16 , leading to a broad @xmath11  distribution . due to final state coulomb interaction with the nucleus field this distribution",
    "is shifted to higher @xmath16energies and thus positive @xmath11  values .",
    "other decay modes of this transition have been studied in detail theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .",
    "the 1.76mev transition decays to @xmath4430% by ipc and is populated with a probability of @xmath65 @xcite by the @xmath7 decay of @xmath66with a q - value of 2.6mev .",
    "since this isotope is rather short - lived ( 64h ) , we used a @xmath3  source , where @xmath66  is produced in equilibrium by strontium @xmath7 decay with a q - value of 586kev .",
    "thus every @xmath0  pair created via ipc decay of the first excited state of @xmath2  is accompanied by about @xmath67 electrons from @xmath7 decay .",
    "especially the electrons from the @xmath3  decay cover exactly the range of investigated @xmath16  and @xmath35   energies of @xmath44150  600 kev , determined by the low energy cutoff below 150kev of our trigger electronics . to achieve satisfactory counting rates for a high statistics experiment , a very strong ( in the order of 1mci ) @xmath3source had to be used , leading to total countrates on the @xmath35  pagoda of up to about 2mhz as in the case of heavy - ion experiments .",
    "a very thin source had to be produced in order to keep broadening of the angular correlation by small - angle scattering of the outgoing leptons as small as possible . a source with 1.5@xmath68 m mylar foil plus a 0.2@xmath68 m aluminum ( needed to keep the source at ground potential )",
    "was produced from commercially available @xmath3   solution .    using this source",
    "we collected a number of 1.3@xmath69 @xmath0-pairs in the sharp sum energy line of the ipc transition over a background of mainly chance coincidences of @xmath16  from ipc and @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "however , the chance coincidence background can be determined quantitatively and subtraction yields the pure ipc spectrum ( fig .",
    "this spectrum is essentially background - free with a ratio of counts in the line ( fwhm 15.5kev ) to the rest of the spectrum of 5.7:1 .",
    "the tail on the low energy side is due to a small part of not suppressed backscattered leptons on either side .",
    "the high statistics in this experiment allows us to subdivide the data into 17 @xmath11  intervals of 66kev width and the ten opening angle bins of our spectrometer .",
    "theory predicts for this e0 transition an angular correlation of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is given by the conversion coefficient , source strength , detection efficiency and duration of the measurement . to determine the angular correlation coefficient @xmath30 the above given function",
    "is fitted to the measured data for each @xmath11  bin ( fig 7a ) , multiplying the first and last bin by two to correct for the smaller solid angle ( rf .",
    "section [ setup ] ) .",
    "however , the measured angular correlation includes also some small - angle scattering of the leptons in the source . to account for this",
    "the theoretical results were folded with small - angle scattering and the experimental response via a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the result of the simulation was fitted in the same manner as the measured data ( fig .",
    "7b ) . now the two values for @xmath30 can be compared .",
    "the effective source thickness of 550@xmath72  was calculated from the known thickness of the foils and with the assumption that the source material is pure . however , since the purity and the mean size of the crystallites of the active material are not well known , only a upper limit of about 1500@xmath72  can be given .    in figure 8",
    "we compare the anisotropy coefficients @xmath30 determined from the measurement with the theoretical calculations adapted to our experimental conditions via monte carlo simulation for various effective source thicknesses indicated . even for a 1500@xmath72  thick source",
    "the theoretical values lie above the measured values except for very large @xmath73 values .",
    "this is a hint that the real anisotropy coefficient might be somewhat smaller ( @xmath449% ) than the calculated values .",
    "however , within the uncertainties of the current analysis ( dominated by the uncertainty of the source thickness ) theory and experiment are consistent .",
    "the anisotropy given by older born approximation results [ with @xmath74 is inconsistent with the measurement .",
    "using a rather weak ( only a few @xmath68ci ) @xmath5  calibration source  source material was commercially available to produce a much stronger source in the same way as with @xmath3 ] we were also able to measure @xmath0-pairs from the weak ipc branch of the 1.77mev m1 transition in @xmath4 , leading to a narrow @xmath0sum - energy line at @xmath76 .",
    "since we detected here only a few pairs per hour , the statistics of this measurement does not allow to subdivide into several @xmath11  bins .",
    "due to the low rates practically no chance coincidences occur in this measurement , and the measured @xmath0  sum energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "9 is again of the same quality as that of fig . 6b .",
    "however , even the low statistics of this measurement allows us to subdivide into the ten opening angle bins and determine the angular correlation of the pairs .",
    "the theoretical prediction for @xmath77 is in this case more complex , but the form given in eq .",
    "[ anisotropy ] is the first order in a @xmath78 expansion of the correct result , so again the same fitting procedure can be used . as can be seen in fig .",
    "10 , the situation is very different from the e0 case reported in the last section : while for the e0 case the intensity decreases for larger @xmath9 values , in this case the intensity increases in the @xmath9 range covered by our setup , thus yielding a negative value of @xmath79 for the anisotropy coefficient .",
    "this is in strong disagreement with the theoretical results derived using the born approximation , but in good agreement with the most recent theoretical results ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    these new results have some impact on estimates for the expected strength of the accompanying @xmath8 line , if some of the previously reported sum energy lines found in heavy ion experiments could be explained by ipc processes .",
    "according to these findings the pair efficiency of our setup is much higher for angular correlations having the pattern of the m1 case than for angular correlations derived from born approximation .",
    "this is particularly true for lines appearing only in the 180@xmath50  bin of the setup , where the doppler shifts of the two leptons almost cancel : for this specific situation the detection efficiency is an order of magnitude larger for @xmath80 than for @xmath81 .",
    "we would thus expect a factor of ten weaker @xmath8 line for @xmath80 than in the old estimate  @xcite .",
    "only a detailed re - analysis of the old data  @xcite can clarify whether ipc could be the origin of these weak lines .",
    "it should be noted in this context that recent results , obtained from high - resolution doppler - shift spectroscopy in heavy - ion collisions at the coulomb barrier , have indeed revealed that weak @xmath0sum - energy lines from ipc transitions of moving emitters can appear in the measured spectra  @xcite .",
    "the measurements presented in this work prove the capability of our setup to detect the sharp @xmath0  sum energy line of the ipc decay of excited heavy nuclei despite the several orders of magnitude more intense background of electrons and @xmath8 rays from the same source .",
    "the measurement with the @xmath3  source clearly shows that this is even the case for very high count rates in the mhz range on the electron detectors , as they are typical also for in - beam measurements ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the results of the first energy and angle resolved measurements of ipc pairs made more than 60 years after the first theoretical prediction of this decay branch prove that born approximation is not suitable for the treatment of ipc transitions of only a few times the threshold in heavy nuclei even for the most simple e0 case and by no means for magnetic multipole transitions .",
    "the theoretical results for the angular correlation presented here , taking into account all relativistic corrections , the finite size of the nucleus and also the magnetic substates for magnetic transitions , are in agreement with the experimental results shown in this paper",
    ". the combined theoretical and experimental efforts of our groups have thus led to a better understanding of a fundamental decay channel of excited nuclei that was assumed to be very well understood for decades .                                                                          *",
