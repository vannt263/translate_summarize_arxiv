    "the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) is an effective , non renormalizable , low energy description of hadron dynamics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main motivation for this model is the natural way in which the phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking appears .",
    "the model has the same global symmetries of qcd , being therefore appropriate for describing low energy hadronic phenomenology .",
    "of special interest are processes involving pions , since they play a quite special role among hadrons .",
    "they are the lightest hadrons , being also pseudoscalar goldstone bosons .    in heavy ion relativistic collisions",
    ", it turns out that the pion multiplicity dominates by far any other hadronic signature , being dominant in the particle content of the central rapidity region , where we expect the quark gluon plasma to be created .",
    "this suggests that pion interactions , i.e. scattering processes , will be important .",
    "since those scattering processes occur in the presence of a thermal environment , our discussion should be presented in the frame of finite temperature quantum field theory .",
    "the main parameters associated to low energy @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering are the so - called scattering lengths , which depend on the isospin channel .",
    "the first measurements of @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths were done by rosselet et al @xcite .",
    "a review about the present experimental status of @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address once again the problem of determining the thermal behavior of the @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths , in the frame of the njl model , using the thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) formalism . for details about this formalism see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the novelty of our discussion is mainly technical , including the resumation in tfd of bubble diagrams associated to a propagating sigma meson , how to regularize products of distributions , as well as other non trivial intermediate steps that appear in the calculation of the diagrams .",
    "it should be noticed that the thermal behavior of the @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths in the njl model has being discussed long time ago in the imaginary time formalism , or matsubara approach @xcite .",
    "our results , specially for @xmath2 , do not agree with this paper .",
    "we do agree qualitatively , however , with the prediction for the thermal behaviour of @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths in the frame of chiral perturbation theory @xcite , and with a recent analysis based on the linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the variation of the scattering lengths as function of temperature , in particular for @xmath2 , begins at much lower values of temperature than the behavior found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the plan of this article is the following : after presenting the general formalism , we classify the relevant diagrams for getting the @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths according to the njl model . then , we proceed to extend our calculation to the finite temperature scenario . for this purpose , a resumation procedure of quark bubbles",
    "is presented in order to describe the thermal sigma meson . as a byproduct of our analysis we found also the thermal evolution of the pion mass .",
    "finally , we compare our results with previous articles about this subject .",
    "in general , the @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering amplitude can be parametrized according to    @xmath3    where the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote isospin components .    by using appropriate projection operators",
    "it is possible to get the following isospin dependent scattering amplitudes    @xmath8    where @xmath9 denotes a scattering amplitude in a given isospin channel . + below the inelastic threshold the partial scattering amplitudes can be parametrized as @xcite .    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a phase - shift in the @xmath12 channel .",
    "in fact our last expression can be expanded according to    @xmath13    the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the scattering lengths and scattering slopes , respectively . in general",
    "the scattering lengths satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "if we are only interested in the scattering lengths @xmath17 , it is enough to calculate the scattering amplitude @xmath9 in the static limit or at threshold i.e. when @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20    @xmath21    our lagrangian is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the quark fields , @xmath24 is a coupling constant and @xmath25 denotes the current quark mass .",
    "we will also consider an effective coupling @xmath26 between the internal quark lines and the external pions .",
    "notice that the model does not include a field associated to the scalar sigma meson .",
    "the propagator of the sigma meson is represented in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) trough a geometrical sum of quark bubbles s chains .",
    "[ fig : sumageom ] , where we show the effective exchange of a sigma meson in the @xmath27channel .",
    "the lowest order diagrams that contribute to the @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths in the njl model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scattpp ] , where the lines with an arrow inside the loops denote the quarks , and the double lines the sigma meson .",
    "the external legs are of course the physical pions with momentum @xmath28 which couple to the quarks trough the effective coupling @xmath26 .",
    "scattering lengths.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    at zero temperature these diagrams have been calculated by schulze @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that the fermion propagators depend on the constituent quark mass @xmath29 , instead of the current quark mass @xmath25 , because our calculations are done in the chiral broken phase .",
    "the quarks acquire their constituent mass due to a condensation of quark - antiquark pairs that appear in a completely analogous way to the cooper pairs in the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "this quark - antiquark pairing mechanism implies the appearance of the constituent mass trough the so called gap equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 , being @xmath32 the numbers of colors and @xmath33 the numbers of flavors . in our case",
    "we will take @xmath34 .",
    "in tfd we have to double the number of degrees of freedom in order to express any thermal average in the ensemble as a vacuum expectation value in a populated vacuum .",
    "the extra fields are called thermal ghosts and , therefore , the propagators in general will be given by a two by two matrix .",
    "in the case of fermions , the matrix propagator has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the sign function .",
    "note that the @xmath38 element is exactly the fermion dolan ",
    "jackiw propagator @xcite .",
    "we may define @xmath39 , separating explicitly the zero temperature from the finite temperature contribution .",
    "the other components of the matrix propagator appear only in internal lines which do not couple to external physical particles .",
    "therefore , in our case , we will have to deal with the full matrix propagator structure , at the one loop level , only when diagrams associated to the exchange of a sigma meson are considered .",
    "as we said , it is given as a sum of chains of quark bubbles .",
    "notice also that in general , there are two different coupling constants for the four quark vertices , depending on the type of quark lines that come together @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will now construct the effective thermal sigma meson propagator .",
    "in general , the chain of bubbles will imply a resumation of the type @xmath40 , where @xmath41is a matrix whose elements @xmath42 represent a bubble with an `` open vertex '' of type @xmath43 at the left side of the bubble , and with a vertex of type @xmath44 at the right side ( @xmath45 ) . in order to avoid double counting of vertices",
    "when powers of @xmath46 are considered , we have to introduce quark bubbles with an open vertex only at the left side .",
    "it is clear that each element @xmath47 involves the sum of the two possibilities to build a chain with two bubbles , in such a way that we have an open vertex of type @xmath43 at the left side and a vertex of type @xmath44 at the right side .",
    "this means that the two possible values for the vertex in between are included .",
    "the same happens for every matrix element of some power @xmath48 of @xmath46 .",
    "it is convenient to define the following matrix @xmath49 that essentially corresponds to @xmath40 , where , we have explicitly introduced the vertices @xmath50 associated to the left side of the sum of the quark bubbles .",
    "a similar treatment was introduced previously in the discussion of thermal renormalons in the @xmath51 theory @xcite .    in order to appreciate the role of the @xmath52 matrix",
    "let us consider diagrams ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : scattpp ] .",
    "there we have quark triangles that couple to the effective sigma meson trough open vertices . to be more explicit ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath53 the triangle diagram with an internal open vertex of type @xmath43 .",
    "then we introduce the vectors @xmath54 in this way , the complete amplitude for these kind of diagrams , including both the zero as well as the finite temperature parts , is given in this matrix language by @xmath55 in the case of the triangle diagrams @xmath56 and @xmath57 of fig .",
    "[ fig : scattpp ] , we need the following elements @xmath58to build the @xmath59 matrix . in the above expression @xmath60 denotes a zero ( finite ) temperature single bubble contribution .",
    "notice that @xmath61 because there is no support for the corresponding integrals , as can be checked , since we are using constituent quark masses @xmath29 , being @xmath62 . in order to handle other singular contributions , like products of delta functions with the same argument",
    ", it was necessary to take different external pion momenta , i.e. a kinematical configuration away from the threshold . in this way ,",
    "singularities disappear and we are able to compute the corresponding integrals , finding that they vanish identically when the limit to the threshold configuration is taken . because of the same reasons , the triangle diagram @xmath63 which couples to the sigma meson trough a vertex @xmath64 , vanishes . in this way , for the triangle diagrams we found @xmath65 where @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the usual fermi ",
    "dirac distribution @xmath69",
    "we have introduced a temperature dependent coupling @xmath70 between pions and quarks .",
    "this coupling can be obtained as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the single quark bubble ( pseudoscalar case ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : burbuja ] . at this point",
    "it is worthwhile to remember that such a quark bubble is used to model a pion in the njl approach .",
    "@xmath73 selects the isospin channel : @xmath74 corresponds to the @xmath75 and/or @xmath76 and @xmath77 are associated to the @xmath78 . in the previous equation , @xmath79 is the thermal pion mass which is obtained in the next section .",
    "following the notation introduced by schulze @xcite , all diagrams at zero temperature are given in terms of the three following integrals @xmath80where @xmath81 is a 3-momentum cutoff . after performing the angular and the @xmath82 integrals",
    ", we found @xmath83    in the njl approach , the gap equation plays a fundamental role . at finite temperature",
    "@xcite it acquires the form @xmath84    the thermal corrections to the effective sigma meson propagator , at the level of a single quark bubble are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : burbuja ] , but where the @xmath85 has been replaced by the identity matrix according to the njl lagrangian .",
    "this loop is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is @xmath88 notice that at this level the dolan ",
    "jackiw propagators are enough .",
    "in particular , the thermal contributions arise from the insertion of only one pure thermal propagator @xmath89 in the loop .",
    "the other propagator has to be the normal one at zero temperature .",
    "it is easy to see that two thermal propagators do not contribute .",
    "the denominator @xmath90 that appears in the @xmath59 matrix ( [ eq : z ] ) is given by @xmath91 using the thermal mass gap equation ( [ eq : gapt ] ) this expression can be written as @xmath92 following the same procedure , we could also construct an effective pion propagator , which is not necessary for our purpose of getting the @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering lengths . from this analysis , however , we get the thermal pion mass determined from the pole of the effective propagator @xmath93 the behavior of @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpit ] .",
    "this allows us to express the quotient @xmath94 in terms of the other quantities that appear in the previous equations . replacing @xmath94 in ( [ eq : abc ] )",
    "we get @xmath95 an expression for @xmath96 was also found trough the mass gap equation in the matsubara or imaginary time formalism by previous authors @xcite .",
    "we agree qualitatively with them .",
    "it is important to remark that in equation ( [ eq : densigma ] ) , @xmath97 is the usual pion mass at zero temperature because we are implementing a calculation at the one loop level .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath96 in the last expression goes beyond this approximation .    finally , we get the following expression , consistent at the one loop perturbation theory , for the effective sigma meson propagator @xmath98    in addition to the triangle diagram given in eq .",
