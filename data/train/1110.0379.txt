    "superconducting circuits are a promising technology for the realization of quantum information on a solid state platform .",
    "several types of qubits  @xcite have been developed realizing high fidelity single qubit operations  @xcite .",
    "rapid progress has also been made towards the realization of robust and scalable universal two - qubit gates  @xcite .",
    "the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed )  @xcite architecture demonstrated to be particularly promising for scalable quantum information . in this scheme highly entangled two  @xcite and three qubits  @xcite have been generated and simple quantum algorithms have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the coherence times of the present generation of devices ( @xmath1s ) are about three orders of magnitudes larger than the first implementations . a relevant step further toward this enhancement has been the elimination of linear sensitivity to low - frequency ( @xmath0 ) noise by operating qubits at `` optimal '' working points . after the first `` sweet spot '' operation demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , a further boost of qubit performances has been achieved in a cqed design named `` transmon ''  @xcite , which is almost insensitive to the detrimental effect of @xmath0 charge noise  @xcite at the price of reduced anharmonicity . however , cqed architectures share with other implementations the presence of @xmath0 flux noise whose amplitude has a characteristic order of magnitude  @xcite , and of @xmath0 critical current noise  @xcite",
    ". together with relaxation processes due to quantum noise , dephasing due to 1/f flux and critical current noise still limits the time scales over which phase coherence and _ entanglement _ are preserved .",
    "in fact , further improvement of the coherence times at least of one order of magnitude would be required to reach the level for practical quantum error correction  @xcite . recently in a new circuit - qed architecture employing a three - dimensional resonator the error correction threshold has been approached  @xcite .",
    "`` optimization '' is thus a key - word of the present generation of superconducting nano - circuits .",
    "clever circuit design and optimal tuning of multi - qubit architectures , supplemented by the use of improved materials , are two complementary strategies currently exploited to address this problem .    a major question currently unsolved is establishing the best strategy to maintain long - enough a sufficient degree of entanglement . in the present article",
    "we address this issue considering a universal two - qubit gate realized by a fixed capacitive coupling of two transmons in a cqed architecture .",
    "the implementation of this scheme has been recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where a @xmath2 operation with individual single - shot non - destructive readout  @xcite and gate fidelity of @xmath3 , partly limited by qubit decoherence , has been demonstrated .",
    "a similar system has been studied theoretically in  @xcite . here",
    "we identify `` optimal ''  @xcite operating conditions of a transmons @xmath2 gate taking into account the multi - level nature of the nano - circuit .",
    "we find that an `` optimal coupling '' exists where the leading order effects of @xmath0 flux and critical current noise are eliminated .",
    "the amount of preserved entanglement is quantified by the concurrence between the two transmons , @xmath4 , which we evaluate in analytic form .",
    "the efficiency of the `` optimal coupling '' is demonstrated by the fact that , for typical @xmath0 noise spectra measured in superconducting nanocircuits , the concurrence is predicted to decay on a time scale  @xcite @xmath5s ( in the absence of other decay mechanisms ) . in addition , @xmath4 may attain values  @xcite guaranteeing violation of a bell inequality until @xmath6s and the gate fidelity is @xmath7 up to @xmath8s . finally , we demonstrate that the optimization is effective also in the presence of relaxation processes due to flux quantum noise . similarly to other cqed systems  @xcite , the gate efficiency can be limited by spontaneous emission through the resonator .",
    "this limitation is likely to be overcome by suitable purcell filters or protected designs  @xcite .",
    "the optimization proposed in the present article can further improve the considerable performance of cqed two - qubit gates based on cavity - mediated interaction  @xcite or on tunable effective interaction with microwave control  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , here effective elimination of omnipresent @xmath0 noise sources is achieved even if one qubit does not operate at optimal bias and without additional controls or bias lines beyond those used for the manipulation of individual qubits , an important feature for scalability .",
    "we consider two transmons with a fixed capacitive coupling , each qubit being embedded in its superconducting resonator used for control and bit - wise readout  @xcite .",

    "is embedded in a transmission line resonator whose relevant mode is modeled as a @xmath14 oscillator  @xcite .",
    "thus the hamiltonian of transmon @xmath15 consists of the cpb hamiltonian plus the dipole - like interaction with the @xmath14 oscillator  @xcite @xmath16 where phase , @xmath17 and charge , @xmath18 , are conjugate variables , @xmath19=i$ ] .",

    "of course , the perturbative scheme can not capture the non - vanishing charge dispersion of the transmon  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the exponential decrease of the charge dispersion with @xmath29 for @xmath30 only results from the exact diagonalization of the cpb hamiltonian in the phase basis  @xcite .",
