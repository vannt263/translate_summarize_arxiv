    "the radio source 3c  84 is associated with the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  1275 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is well known that 3c  84 has a pair of compact radio lobe structures on the central 10-pc scale @xcite .",
    "because of its proximity , it allows us to study the region within the central sub - pc scale using a very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) .",
    "it is an ideal laboratory to investigate the formation mechanism of relativistic jet ultimately powered by super - massive black holes and the interaction between the jets and ambient matter in the galactic central regions .",
    "thanks to the recent observations with _ fermi_/lat , we have a new opportunity to explore gev @xmath0-ray production mechanism in misaligned radio - loud agns @xcite .",
    "with cgro / egret , a few extragalactic radio galaxies , such as centaurus a @xcite , 3c  111 @xcite , and ngc  6251 @xcite had been already detected . however , the detection of ngc  1275 @xcite by _ fermi_/lat in 2008 august is particularly noteworthy because ngc  1275 was not detected by cgro / egret @xcite . the flux density detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat is about 7 times higher than the upper limit of egret sensitivity .",
    "intriguingly , the radio monitoring also shows the flux increase starting in 2005 .",
    "the time variation of @xmath0-ray flux density shows a similar trend with the radio flux density on the timescale of decades , implying the possible connection between the @xmath0-ray emission and variable radio component .",
    "overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc  1275 from radio to @xmath0-ray can be explained by the synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) model and the deceleration jet model @xcite adopting sub - pc for the size of emitting region .",
    "the authors derived lorentz factors of the emitting region @xmath4 ( @xmath5 deg , @xmath6 ) for the case of ssc model and @xmath7 varying from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 deg , @xmath11 varying 1.6 to 2.7 ) for the decelerating model , where @xmath12 and @xmath11 are the jet angle to the line of sight and the beaming factor of the emitting region , respectively .",
    "here we should stress that the size of the @xmath0-ray emitting region adopted in the sed models is comparable to a vlbi component size .",
    "therefore , it is essential to test the scenario of co - spatiality of gev @xmath0-ray and radio emitting regions by vlbi observations .    in order to find the radio counterpart of the gev @xmath0-ray emitting region",
    ", we have conducted vlbi observations using the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) at 22  ghz between 2006 june 14 and 2009 april 24 ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the monotonic increase of radio flux density mainly originated in the newly born bright component c3 ( paper i ) .",
    "the measured projected speed of c3 , however , was @xmath13 on average between 2007 october 24 and 2009 april 24 in the central sub - pc to pc scale .",
    "given previously estimated jet angle to the line of sight ( @xmath14 - @xmath15 : @xcite ) , the de - projected speed corresponds to 0.24@xmath16 - 0.55@xmath16 , i.e. slower than the speed of jet derived from the sed modeling @xcite .",
    "the result of vera observation implies @xmath17 , and there seems to be a discrepancy between the sed models and vlbi observations .    a possible idea to explain",
    "this discrepancy is that a jet component with relativistic speed other than c3 , located much closer to the central black hole ( within the central sub - pc ) , is responsible for the gev @xmath18-ray emission .",
    "if such a relativistic motion in the jet of 3c  84 occurs only in vicinity of the black hole , the speed of c3 could have been relativistic soon after the ejection from the core , and then it underwent to a rapid deceleration . also suggested that jets are relativistic in bright cluster galaxies but they decelerate very soon ( sub - parsec scale ) because of a strong interaction with the ism . in paper",
    "i , we argued possible detection of the relativistic speed at the early stage of emergence of c3 .",
    "however , this was not conclusive because of ( 1 ) the lack of spatial resolution of vera at 22  ghz and ( 2 ) possible screening by free - free absorption .",
    "in order to overcome the above potential problems , higher resolution observations at higher frequency are required .",
    "we explore the possible relativistic flow of c3 at the early stage of its emergence from the core with the archival vlba data at 43  ghz .",
    "we selected only data obtained from 2002 to 2008 , i.e. considering earlier epochs than those discussed in paper i. we also discuss the sed fit using one - zone ssc model involving the actual measured apparent motion of c3 and possible ideas for incorporating the vlbi observation with gev @xmath18-ray emission .    throughout this paper , we adopt the following cosmological parameters ; @xmath19  km sec@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( 1  mas = 0.353  pc , and 0.1  mas  yr@xmath20 = @xmath23 ) .",
    "first , we examined all of the ( available ) archival vlba data at 43  ghz obtained between 2002 to 2008 from the data archive system of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "data reduction was performed using astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . @xmath24",
    "@xmath25 amplitude calibration was done based on the measurements of the system noise temperature ( @xmath26 ) during the observations and the elevation dependent antenna gain provided by each station . in this process",
    ", we also applied opacity correction due to the atmospheric attenuation , assuming that the time variation of the opacity is not significant during each observation .",
    "fringe fitting was performed with the aips task fring . after applying the delay and rate solutions , we combined each set of data into one channel across the 8-mhz bandwidth .",
    "imaging and self - calibration process was performed using difmap software package @xcite .",
    "the final images were produced after iterations of clean , phase and amplitude self - calibration processes on successively shortened calibration time .",
    "second , we excluded the entire datasets with relatively poor dynamic range ( because of bad weather condition or lack of baselines ) .",
    "finally , we ended up with 28-epoch datasets ( shown in table [ tab : obsinfo ] ) . in almost all the archival data we analyzed , 3c  84",
    "was observed as a calibrator and the typical observing time is less than 10 min .",
    "the single dish monitoring data at 37  ghz is adopted from metshovi quasar monitoring program .",
    "the observations were carried out with metshovi 14-m radio telescope . in order to compare the vlbi and single dish lightcurves",
    ", we selected the data from 2001 december to 2008 december .",
    "details of these observations and calibration are described in .",
    "to obtain the flux density of each component of 3c  84 jet , we modeled the source structure using the difmap task modelfit . in the modelfit process , we fitted multiple elliptical gaussian model components to the visibility data of each epoch .",
    "we adopted the fitting model components that gave a good fit to the data as judged by relative @xmath27-squared statistics . in some cases , we adopted circular gaussian models or point sources instead of the elliptical gaussian if either of them were capable of reproducing a better fit .",
    "we consider the fit acceptable if the model components contain more than 95% of the total cleaned flux .",
    "resultant images mainly consist of three major components ( c1 , c2 , and c3 ; shown in  4 ) , although c2 is not identified in some epochs because of low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in addition to the major components , some faint minor components are fitted .",
    "the choice of adding a few minor components to the model is somewhat arbitrary , and it is difficult to maintain the consistency across the epochs .",
    "we note , however , that the choice of minor components does not appreciably affect the fitting results of the major components .    in order to check that the fit is not local minimum",
    ", we confirmed that the result is unchanged significantly by choosing different starting gaussian models .",
    "in general , it is difficult to measure a positional error of each component quantitatively from single epoch interferometric data . in particular",
    ", a systematic error , which arises from the deconvolution error , the presence of other nearby jet features and so on , is difficult to estimate separately .",
    "hence the sampled interferometric - visibility on the @xmath28-plane is poor , and therefore systematic error of component position may be large compared to long - track observations . for these reasons , we estimated the component positional errors by examining the scatters in the positions of components ( defined by the aips task maxfit ) in images between two close epochs ( within 10-day separation ) , such that the jet has approximately the same structure in both epochs .",
    "the apparent motion of @xmath29 will show 2.4 @xmath30as / day positional change ( @xmath31 0.01 of typical vlba 43-ghz beam ) , so the motion of the component is negligible within 10 days in this study .",
    "we have done this analysis on 11 pairs of images ( table [ tab : pairs ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : err ] shows the differences of position of c3 for these 11 pairs .",
    "each data point is normalized with the beam size averaged between the pair .",
    "the standard deviations along right ascension ( @xmath32 ) and declination ( @xmath33 ) normalized by beamsize ( @xmath34 ) are 0.150 and 0.098 , respectively . as in @xcite , the @xmath35% confidence interval of the standard deviation of population for statistical ensemble @xmath36 , @xmath37 , is estimated from @xmath38 sample of statistical ensemble @xmath36 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is @xmath41 statistics for d.o.f .",
    "= @xmath38 on which the event @xmath42 occurs with probability @xmath43 .",
    "we apply this estimator for right ascension ensemble ( @xmath36 = ra ) and declination ensemble ( @xmath36 = dec ) . given @xmath38 = 21 and @xmath44 = 0.95 , the standard deviation of population for both right ascension ( @xmath45 ) and declination ( @xmath46 ) is @xmath47 hereafter , the positional error of each component is set as 0.255 @xmath34 for right ascension and 0.166 @xmath34 for declination , where @xmath34 is the beam size on each epoch .",
    "figure [ fig:3c84_q_all ] shows the total intensity images at 43  ghz .",
    "information on all images is also summarized in table [ tab : vlba_q_sum ] .",
    "all images are convolved with the circular restoring beam with a diameter of 0.3  mas . after 2003 november 20",
    ", a new component c3 seems to emerge south of c1 . this new component gradually becomes brighter with increasing separation from component c1 .",
    "emergence of c3 is also seen in 22-ghz observations ( paper i ) around 2007 , but the vlba 43-ghz observations find that the component has already emerged in earlier epoch , because of thin opacity and/or higher resolution than the vera 22  ghz observations . after the emergence",
    ", c3 is advancing toward position angle @xmath48 170@xmath49 measured from c1 .",
    "its direction differs from that of c2 with respect to c1 by 40 - 50 degrees .",
    "no counter jet component is detected with a level of @xmath50 throughout all epochs .",
    "physical parameters of all fitted components are listed in tables [ tab : model_c1 ] , [ tab : model_c2 ] , and [ tab : model_c3 ] .",
    "we use the aips task maxfit to define the ( relative ) positions of components at each epoch .",
    "since absolute position in each image is lost at the self calibration and fringe fitting processes , we need to define the reference position for the argument of kinematics . in this work",
    ", we will evaluate kinematics with reference to the optically - thick radio core .",
    "thus we attempt to measure the spectral index of each component to define the reference position .",
    "we measured the spectral index @xmath44 for each component at 2008 november 27 , when 22  ghz and 43  ghz observations were carried out only one day apart .",
    "we define the spectral index between 43  ghz and 22  ghz as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are flux of components at 43  ghz and 22  ghz .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spectrum ] , the spectrum of c1 is flat ( @xmath54 ) while those of c2 and c3 are steep ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "it seems natural to interpret c1 as the radio core and c2 and c3 as optically - thin jet components .",
    "hereafter , we regard c1 as the reference position .    figure [ fig : positions ] shows the change of the peak position of c3 .",
    "the motion of c3 is mostly in the north - south direction , but also shows the motion in the east - west direction . to describe the positional change of c3",
    ", firstly we set a coordinate as shown in figure [ fig : separation ] .",
    "we define @xmath56 axis to be parallel to the line between the position of c1 and c3 in 2003 november 20 ( position angle = 161.4@xmath57 ) and @xmath58 axis to be perpendicular to @xmath56 .",
    "then , we fitted the positional change of c3 using a quadratic function in consideration for the change in speed for each axis ( figure [ fig : separation ] ) .",
    "position of c3 in @xmath56 and @xmath58 coordinates is parameterized as , @xmath59 where the units of @xmath56 and @xmath58 are in mas , @xmath60 is the time from 2003",
    "november 1 in years .",
    "the best fit parameters are , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . the apparent speed and acceleration can be calculated from these parameters .",
    "the apparent speed of c3 is changing from @xmath67 mas yr@xmath20 to @xmath68 mas yr@xmath20 ( or @xmath69 = @xmath70 to @xmath71 ) between 2003 november 20 and 2008 november 27 with acceleration rate of @xmath72 mas yr@xmath73 ( or @xmath74 yr@xmath20 ) . the averaged @xmath69 of c3 from 2003 november 20 to 2007 november 2 , when c3 is not identified in paper i , is derived to be @xmath75 .",
    "although paper i discussed possible detection of relativistic flow with @xmath76 during the middle of 2007 , we can not find such a fast motion at earlier epochs from high - resolution vlba data .",
    "thus , we can rule out the existence of relativistic flow with @xmath76 during 2006 - 2007 . in figure",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , the curved line shows the constraint on the jet speed and jet angle to the line of sight , based on the observed projected speed of c3 ( @xmath1 - @xmath2 ) , together with the jet speed and jet angle adopted in @xcite .",
    "there is a clear discrepancy between the measured motion and predicted jet speed from both one - zone ssc model and the deceleration model .",
    "the averaged apparent speed of c3 from 2007 november 2 to 2008",
    "november 27 is derived as @xmath77 from interpolation .",
    "this value is somewhat larger than the result of paper i ( @xmath78 on average between 2007 october 24 and 2009 april 24 ) .",
    "this inconsistency might be caused by ( 1 ) the difference of coordinate setting and time - dependence of fitting function , and/or ( 2 ) under - estimation of positional error in paper i. focusing on the epoch overlapping with paper i ( 2007 - 2008 ) , the separation of c3 is systematically larger than that in paper i by @xmath79  mas as if expected from the position shift of reference position ( peak position of c1 ) due to the optical depth .",
    "c2 is too faint to accurately determine its peak position , and higher dynamic range data are needed to identify and discuss it s kinematics .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows the lightcurve of total cleaned flux and the flux density of each component at 43  ghz , together with metshovi 37-ghz lightcurve .",
    "the flux of each component is defined as the integrated flux of gaussian component , which is identified with the gaussian models obtained by the difmap modelfit .",
    "an example of the result of gaussian fitting is shown in figure [ fig : model_ims ] .",
    "overall trends of the 43-ghz vlba total cleaned flux and metshovi 37-ghz lightcurve are very similar , and the flux density of metshovi at 37  ghz is always brighter by @xmath48 5 jy than that of vlba at 43  ghz throughout all epochs .",
    "this suggests that the flux variability essentially arises from the central pc region .    from 2002 to 2008 , the lightcurve of total vlba flux density shows moderate increase .",
    "after 2008 , rapid flux increase is clearly seen .",
    "c3 shows a significant flux density increase , which is consistent with paper i. c1 also shows a flux density increase , although not obvious in paper i. this could be because of large optical depth at 22  ghz .",
    "the increasing tendencies of c1 and c3 flux density resemble that of total cleaned flux .",
    "this indicates that the radio flare in central @xmath80 pc region originates in c1 and c3 , invoking the possibility that the gev @xmath18-ray emission originates in these innermost components .",
    "this view is consistent with the @xmath18-ray emitting zone derived by ( distance from the core @xmath31 1pc ) .",
    "in this section , we try to reproduce the broadband flux from @xmath0-ray emitting region of 3c  84 based on the quantities of c3 obtained as in  [ sec : results ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] , we show the observed sed of 3c  84 and one - zone ssc model fit to the observed sed using the size , flux , and @xmath81 of c3 component measured by the vlba observations .",
    "the flux data are the same as the ones in @xcite but we add the 43-ghz flux of c3 measured on 2008 august 27 .",
    "we assume that @xmath0-ray and vlba 43-ghz flux are emitted from the same sub - pc region . optical data",
    "( after the extraction of host galaxy contribution ; c.f . , @xcite ) is also used as flux upper limit of c3 .",
    "the @xmath69 at 2008 august is @xmath82 ( in figure [ fig : gamma ] ) . assuming the jet viewing angle as @xmath83 ( @xcite )",
    ", the intrinsic jet speed @xmath84 can be estimated as @xmath85 , which corresponds to @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the gaussian - fitted model size of c3 is @xmath88-@xmath89 . to fit the 43-ghz flux ,",
    "the size of @xmath0-ray emitting region is adopted as @xmath90 which is slightly smaller than the c3 model size .",
    "the detailed numerical treatment of synchrotron and inverse compton scattering processes is shown in @xcite and references therein .",
    "if we adopt @xmath91 as is the case in @xcite , 43  ghz lies below the frequency of low energy cutoff and therefore the spectral index should be @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed spectral index between 22 and 43  ghz @xmath94 as shown in figure [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "then , we adopt @xmath95 to raise the cutoff frequency . this fit is indicated by a solid line in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the model spectrum requires an extremely hard electron energy index @xmath96 occasionally seen in tev blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) if we try to reproduce the flux data at other wavelengths .",
    "the synchrotron opacity becomes unity at @xmath97  ghz , and the resultant model spectrum shows @xmath98 , which is still inconsistent with the observed spectral index .",
    "hence it seems difficult to attribute the broadband sed to the one - zone ssc emission from c3 .",
    "this indicates that some other components c1 and/or c2 also should be taken in account for the candidates for @xmath0-ray emitting region .",
    "following the detection of 3c  84 by _ fermi_/lat in 2008 , we discussed the kinematics of the newly formed jet component c3 using our vera radio observations for the period 2006 june - 2009 april in paper i. in this paper , we further explored the kinematics and lightcurves of c1 , c2 , and c3 using archival 43-ghz vlba data spanning a time interval from 2002 january to 2008 november , i.e. before the vera observations .",

    "the lightcurve of vlba at 43  ghz shows a trend similar to that of metshovi at 37  ghz , indicating that the increase of radio flux density arises from the region within the central @xmath99  pc",
    ". in particular , the rapid increase of flux density has been seen since the middle of 2008 .",
    "both c1 and c3 show the largest change of flux density for this flare .",
    "this indicates that the radio flare in the central @xmath99  pc region originates in both c1 and c3 .",
