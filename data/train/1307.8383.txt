    "when studying formal solutions of complex analytic ode near a multiple singular point , it is the general rule to find divergent series .",
    "however , one can always construct true analytic solutions , defined on certain sectors attached to the singularity , which are asymptotic to the formal solution , and which are in some sense unique .",
    "in general , the solutions on different sectors do not coincide , and if extended to larger sectors , they may drastically change their asymptotic behavior due to the presence of hidden exponentially small terms , known as the ( non - linear ) stokes phenomenon . in case where the singularity is a generic double point such sectorial solutions",
    "are obtained , using the borel and laplace transformations , as the borel sums of the formal one .",
    "it is now understood , that the divergence of the asymptotic series is caused by singularities of its borel transform , which also encode information on the geometry of the singularity . another way how to understand",
    "the stokes phenomena is by considering generic parameter depending deformations which split the multiple ( irregular ) singular point into several simple ( regular ) singularities : the local analytic solutions at each singular point of the deformed equation do not match , thus explaining why solutions with nice asymptotic behavior at the limit when the singular points coalesce only exist in sectors .    when investigating families of analytic systems of odes depending on a complex parameter , that unfold a multiple singularity , one is faced with the problem that the borel method of summation of formal series does not allow to deal with several singularities and their confluence .",
    "the goal of this article is to show how one can generalize ( unfold ) the corresponding borel ",
    "laplace transformations , in order to study bounded solutions of first order non - linear parametric systems with an unfolded double singularity of the form @xmath0 with @xmath1 an invertible @xmath2-matrix and @xmath3 .",
    "such solutions correspond to ramified center manifolds of an unfolded codimension 1 saddle - node singularity in a family of complex vector fields @xmath4    it is well known that for generic ( non - resonant ) values of the parameter @xmath5 , there exists a local analytic solution on a neighborhood of each simple singularity @xmath6 .",
    "previous studies of the confluence phenomenon ( see @xcite , @xcite ) have focused at the limit behavior of these local solutions when @xmath7 . because the resonant values of @xmath8 accumulate at @xmath9 in a finite number of directions , these directions of resonance in the parameter space could not be covered in those studies .",
    "we will construct a new kind of parametric solutions of systems which are defined and bounded on certain ramified domains attached to both singularities @xmath6 ( at which they possess a limit ) in a spiraling manner .",
    "they depend analytically on the parameter @xmath8 taken from a ramified sector of opening @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 from a sector of opening @xmath12 ) , thus covering a full neighborhood of the origin in the parameter space ( including those parameters values for which the unfolded system is resonant ) , and they converge uniformly when @xmath8 tends radially to 0 to a pair of the classical sectoral solutions : borel sums of the formal power series solution of the limit system , defined on two sectors covering a full neighborhood of the double singularity at the origin .",
    "in fact , each such pair of the sectoral borel sums for @xmath13 unfolds to a unique above mentioned parametric solution .",
    "we state these results in section [ subsec : bl-1.2 ] , and illustrate them in section [ subsec : bl-1.3 ] on the problem of existence of normalizing transformations for families of linear differential systems unfolding a non - resonant irregular singularity of poincar rank 1 .",
    "while these solutions can also be obtained by other methods , the advantage of our approach is that it provides a unified treatment for all values of the parameter @xmath8 and elucidates the form of natural domains on which the solutions exist and are bounded .",
    "most importantly , it gives an insight to intrinsic properties of the singularity and to the source of the divergence similar to that provided by the classical borel ",
