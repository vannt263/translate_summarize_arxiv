    "the classical unitary realization result of de branges and rovnyak for schur functions on the complex unit disk is the following : let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be separable hilbert spaces and let @xmath2 be an operator schur function on @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath2 is analytic with @xmath4 a contraction for all @xmath5",

    "this paper is a direct continuation of @xcite published earlier in this journal .",
    "we refer to that paper as `` part i '' and assume that the reader is familiar with it .",
    "in part i , the research is placed in its context and detailed background on passive system nodes is presented .",
    "results from part i will be referenced using a capital ` i ' ; e.g. thm .",
    "i.5.1 refers to ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.1 ) . in a certain sense ,",
    "the conservative model is a coupling of the two semi - conservative models in part i , but working with the conservative model is easier than working with those in part i. indeed , the conservative model has the same structure as its adjoint , and hence it combines all the good properties of the semi - conservative realizations .",
    "investigations closely related to that reported here have been undertaken before , starting from the work @xcite of de branges and rovnyak ; see @xcite for a nice historic overview of work on the disk case up to that point . for a good monograph on the disk case ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the first results in the right - half - plane setting are in @xcite ; here arov and nudelman used a linear fractional transformation to reduce the half - plane case to the disk case .",
    "most of the more recent publications on half - plane functional models also employ this so - called cayley transformation , but in the present paper we work the details out directly in the half - plane setting , in order to expose detail that is invisible in the disk setting .",
    "adamjan and arov @xcite showed how to embed the sz .- nagy - foia model into a suitably more general version of the lax - phillips scattering picture ( for the discrete - time setting ) ; much later nikolski - vasyunin [ nv86 , nv89 , nv98 ] refined this analysis by doing such an embedding also for a pavlov model and a suitably modified version of the de branges - rovnyak model .",
    "continuous - time versions of this analysis are also of interest , and we plan to investigate this in a forthcoming publication .    in @xcite an ( implicit ) `` lurking isometry '' argument and cayley transformations were used to obtain the existence of a conservative realization for any operator schur function on the disk or the right - half plane .",
    "the realization that we describe in the present paper is a more explicit alternative to the realization constructed in @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite have been extended to a multi - variable case in @xcite , and we expect also the present results to have natural extensions to various multi - variable settings .    the continuous - time conservative realization has been studied in the state / signal framework developed by arov and staffans , too , in @xcite . here the central idea is to consider in @xmath27 the graph of the toeplitz operator @xmath28 with symbol @xmath16 , where @xmath29 is a kren  space , without assuming any particular partition @xmath30 into an input space @xmath0 and output space @xmath1 . in this setting ,",
    "the action of the realization is a pure shift on the appropriate state space and projections onto input and output components are avoided , which leads to cleaner formulas and intuitively more transparent results ; see @xcite for details .",
    "again , in the present work the objective is to obtain as explicit formulas as possible for the input / state / output setting .",
    "finally , we mention that a closely related realization of a nevanlinna family ( corresponding to an impedance - passive setting rather than to the present scattering - passive setting ) in terms of a boundary relation has been worked out in @xcite ( or see @xcite for a more elaborate version ) .    the paper is laid out as follows : in  [ sec : sysnode ] we briefly present some additional background on conservative and simple system nodes that is needed in the present paper , with the auxiliary proofs on non - invertible intertwinements postponed to appendix [ app : intertwinement ] .",
    "the conservative model is introduced in  [ sec : consmodel ] after its state space has been constructed in  [ sec : statespace ] . in  [ sec : extrapolation ] , we present an explicit identification of the extrapolation space and calculate the ( unbounded ) control operator of the conservative model . the paper is concluded in ",
    "[ sec : recovering ] , where we exhibit the relationship with the classical de branges - rovnyak model .",
