    "in recent years , the discovery of high temperature superconductors has generated a renewed interest in understanding the magnetization properties of type ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "the magnetization process is usually described in terms of the bean model @xcite : as the magnetic flux enters into the sample from the boundaries , quenched disorder is responsible for the formation of a constant flux gradient .",
    "the bean model provides a phenomenological picture of average magnetization properties , such as hysteresis and thermal relaxation @xcite , but does not describe local space - time fluctuations .",
    "indeed , recent experiments showed that these fluctuations are not only common , but also large , spanning several length scales : the flux line dynamics is intermittent , taking place in avalanches @xcite , and flux fronts are fractal @xcite .    a widely used modeling strategy to describe the fluctuations in the magnetization process consists in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of interacting vortices , pinned by quenched random impurities @xcite .",
    "with this approach it has been possible to model flux profiles @xcite , hysteresis @xcite , avalanches @xcite and plastic flow @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of these studies @xcite is to link the macroscopic behavior , as described for instance by generalized bean models , to the microscopic vortex dynamics .",
    "recently , we have shown that the flux penetration due to interacting vortices in a disordered superconductor can be described by a disordered non - linear diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "the equation can be obtained performing a coarse - graining of the microscopic equation of motion of the vortices . in the absence of pinning",
    ", the equation reduces to the model introduced in ref .",
    "this model has been solved analytically to provide expressions for the dynamics of the front for different boundary conditions@xcite . when quenched disorder is included in the diffusion equations ,",
    "flux fronts are pinned in agreement with md simulations . varying the parameters of the equation",
    ", we observe a crossover from flat to fractal flux fronts , consistent with experimental observations .",
    "the value of the fractal dimension suggests that the strong disorder limit is described by percolation @xcite . in the weak disorder limit",
    ", we recover the analytical results derived in refs .",
    "@xcite . using this description , we can",
    "thus directly link continuum theories , for which analytical solutions are possible , to the microscopic equations used in md simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we systematically analyze the effect of different boundary conditions on the propagation of the flux front .",
    "a similar study was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite in the framework of non - linear flux diffusion in the absence of disorder .",
    "we show here that the results are in agreement with md simulations for various different boundary conditions .",
    "next , we analyze the effect of disorder by varying the pinning strength in the md system .",
    "the results are then interpreted theoretically by means of the non - linear diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose a phenomenological equation for the front position that is able to capture in a simple way the behavior of the system , recovering the numerical results for the different boundary conditions .",
    "in an infinitely long cylinder , flux lines can be represented as a set of interacting particles performing an overdamped motion in a random pinning landscape @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for each flux line @xmath0 is given by @xmath1~ , \\label{eq : vf}\\ ] ] where the effective viscosity is obtained from material parameters as @xmath2 .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the magnetic quantum flux , @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 is the resistivity of the normal phase and @xmath6 is the upper critical field . the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vf ] ) accounts for the vortex - vortex interaction and it is given by @xmath7 where the function @xmath8 is a bessel function decaying exponentially for @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the london penetration length @xcite .",
    "the interaction is cut off at a distance @xmath11 to improve computational efficiency . the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vf ] ) describes the interaction between pinning centers , modeled as localized traps , and flux lines . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the force due to a pinning center located at @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the range of the wells ( typically @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the total number of pinning centers ) . for the pinning force",
    ", we use the following expression : @xmath18 , for @xmath19 and zero otherwise . in the present simulations we restrict ourselves to the case",
    "@xmath20 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the implementation of thermal noise in md simulations ) .    as we discussed in the introduction",
    ", we intend to study the effect of different boundary conditions on the flux penetration .",
    "we start with an empty system and concentrate all the vortices in a small strip at the boundary . due to mutual repulsion",
    ", the vortices will be pushed inside the material , forming a flux front .",
    "there are several ways to implement the boundary conditions , corresponding to different experimental situations . here",
    ", we will consider the following boundary conditions @xcite :    * \\(a ) constant total number of vortices .",
    "experimentally this corresponds to an external control of the magnetic flux . *",
    "\\(b ) constant vortex concentration at the boundary .",
    "this case corresponds to an external control of the magnetic field . *",
    "\\(c ) total vortex number increasing at constant rate .",
    "this represents an external control of the flux rate .",
    "* \\(d ) boundary concentration increasing at constant rate , corresponding to a constant field rate .    as a word of caution",
    ", one should notice that boundary conditions can be more complicated in reality , due to complex surface barriers that oppose flux penetration .",
    "these are not considered here and the only surface barrier is provided by already entered flux lines .",
    "we perform md simulations based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : vf ] ) and analyze the flux front propagation for different values of the pinning strength @xmath21 .",
    "we typically use up to @xmath22 poisson distributed pinning centers of width @xmath23 in a system of size @xmath24 ) , corresponding to a density of @xmath25 .",
    "the number @xmath26 of flux lines depends essentially on the boundary condition adopted in the simulation .",
    "the injection of magnetic flux into the sample is implemented as in ref .",
    "@xcite , concentrating at the beginning of the simulation all the flux lines in a small strip @xmath27 , parallel to the @xmath28 direction , and imposing periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "the front position is taken as the @xmath29 coordinate of the most advanced particle in the system at different times .",
    "the case ( a ) , corresponding to a constant vortex number , was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we showed that the front position @xmath30 grows initially with time as @xmath31 for small times . eventually the front position slows down and saturates to a value @xmath32 which increases as the strength of the pinning centers @xmath21 is decreased . in particular ,",
    "the front pinning length @xmath32 was found to scale as @xmath33 @xcite . here",
    ", we compare this behavior with that of cases ( b - d ) .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath34 , corresponding to a clean superconductor ( i.e. , without defects ) in order to clearly identify the front penetration law in the initial regime . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show that the front advances as a power law with an exponent that depends on the boundary condition .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath35 for case ( b ) , @xmath36 for case ( c ) and @xmath37 for case ( d ) .",
    "the presence of disorder can affect all these behaviors in a different way , depending on the imposed boundary condition .",
    "the case ( b ) is quite similar to the case ( a ) studied in ref .",
    "@xcite : after an initial transient , the front gets pinned and the pinning length scales with the pinning strength ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) . in particular , the pinning length scales roughly as @xmath38 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . for case ( c )",
    ", the front never gets pinned .",
    "the effect of disorder is only to slow down the dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "a similar behavior is found for case ( d ) .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the front propagation can be described by coarse graining the system and obtaining a disordered non - linear diffusion equation .",
    "the equation that rules the evolution of the local vortex density @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a random _ friction _ force due to the pinning centers , with a typical value scaling as @xmath43 .    for @xmath20 and @xmath34 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fin ] ) can be solved exactly using scaling methods @xcite .",
    "in particular the density profiles obey the equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 depend on the boundary conditions and satisfy @xmath47 .",
    "for the cases considered : a ) @xmath48 , @xmath49 ; b ) @xmath50 , @xmath51 ; c ) @xmath52 , @xmath53 ; and d ) @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "these results are in perfect agreement with the numerical simulations reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , since the exponent @xmath46 describes the dynamics of the front position .",
    "the function @xmath56 also depends on the boundary condition and for the case ( a ) is given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 and vanishes for @xmath59 .",
    "the other cases are reported in refs .",
    "we check by md numerical simulations that , in the presence of disorder , the density profiles are described by the non - linear diffusion equation ( [ eq : fin ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we show that the profiles follow the @xmath34 solution and then deform when pinning starts to dominate .",
    "in order to understand in a simple way the effect of disorder on the front propagation for different boundary conditions , we can write an equation for the average position of the front .",
    "the approach is very similar in spirit to what is done for the imbibition of porous media @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , the front is driven by the density gradient against the pinning landscape .",
    "the density gradient can be estimated simply as @xmath60 , where @xmath30 is the front position and @xmath61 is the boundary density .",
    "the typical pinning force can simply be taken as @xmath62 .",
    "collecting these two contribution we write @xmath63 in order to close the problem we have to specify the behavior of the boundary density , which clearly will depend on the particular boundary condition chosen .",
    "let us consider the various cases :    \\(a ) when the total number of vortices is conserved , the boundary density decreases as the front advances .",
    "this can be explained by noting that the total number of vortices can be roughly estimated as @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 . inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc ] ) we obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 and time is expressed in units of @xmath68 .",
    "( [ eq : bc - a ] ) admits an implicit solution as @xmath69 which can be expanded for @xmath70 to give @xmath71 ( short times ) , and for @xmath72 ( long times ) yielding @xmath73 , corresponding to a pinned front .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the scaling found in numerical simulations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\(b ) the case of a constant vortex density at the boundary is similar to case ( a ) .",
    "the boundary condition is simply @xmath74 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc ] ) becomes @xmath75 where time is now expressed in units of @xmath76 . as in the previous case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc - b ] ) can not be solved explicitly but from the implicit solution it is possible to obtain the asymptotic behavior : @xmath77 at short times and @xmath78 at long times , in agreement with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "\\(c ) this case is similar to case ( a ) , with the difference that the total number of vortices increases with time ( i.e. @xmath79 ) . due to this",
    "the front is never pinned . in absence of pinning we",
    "recover the @xmath80 behavior observed in md simulations .",
    "we can not find an analytical solution of the equation in this case and resort to numerical integration .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] indicate that the front asymptotically grows as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the solution of the equation @xmath83 .",
    "thus for low pinning we expect that the coefficient @xmath82 decreases linearly with the pinning strength .",
    "this result is in agreement with the md simulation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "\\(d ) as in case ( c ) , the front is not pinned by the disorder , which has the only effect of reducing the front velocity .",
    "one can compute the asymptotic velocity imposing @xmath84 and inserting this expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc ] ) , that now reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the rate of increase of the boundary density . solving for @xmath87 one obtains @xmath88 .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the effect of different boundary conditions on the flux penetration in disordered type ii superconductors .",
    "we have conducted a series of md simulations of interacting vortices and interpreted the results in terms of a non - linear diffusion equation . in the limit of no disorder , the equation has been solved in refs .",
    "@xcite yielding solutions for the front propagation and the density profiles . here",
    "we have shown that these results are in perfect agreement with md simulations . moreover",
    ", we have found that the presence of pinning centers affects the behavior of the system and , depending on the boundary conditions , the front is either pinned or simply slowed down . to clarify these effects ,",
    "we have introduced a simple equation of motion for the front position , in the same spirit of washburn approach to imbibition @xcite . despite its simplicity",
    ", the equation captures the essential features of the front dynamics .",
    "an important question that still remains to be addressed is the relevance of these results for experiments .",
    "we can associate each one of the boundary condition studied here to different experimental conditions , corresponding to the way the field is applied to the sample . in many cases ,",
    "the presence of surface barriers for flux penetration could in principle modify the scaling behavior discussed here .",
    "we believe , however , that away from the surface this effect should not be important and the scaling would be recovered .",
    "in addition , thermal and quantum creep effects in general may lead to a slowly moving front , even when pinning is expected .",
    "it is possible to account for these effects in this framework considering the diffusion term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fin ] ) or adding a random noise term to the front propagation equation . in conclusion",
    ", we expect that our approach together with a systematic series of magneto - optical measurements performed under different magnetic field controls ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite , will represent significant steps for the understanding of the flux penetration phenomenon in disordered superconductors .",
