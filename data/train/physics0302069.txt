    "the purpose of this paper is to derive formulas for the orbit deflections caused by the fringe fields of non - solenoidal accelerator magnets .",
    "the main ingredient is a multipole expansion for fields having arbitrary longitudinal profile and including all field components ( and only those ) required to be present by maxwell s equations .    because terminology describing magnets depends on context",
    ", we define some of our terms , if only implicitly , by using them in this section .",
    "most magnets in accelerators are `` dipoles '' , `` quadrupoles '' or other `` multipoles '' where , in this paper , we distinguish by quotation marks the common names of these magnets from the dipole , quadrupole , multipole , etc . ,",
    "terms appearing in mathematical expansions of their magnetic fields .",
    "the particle orbits are _ paraxial _ , with _ small _ transverse displacements , @xmath0 , with slopes @xmath1 small compared to 1 because the orbits are more or less parallel to the @xmath2-axis , which is the magnet centerline . the dominant magnetic field components ( @xmath3 ) are therefore _ transverse _ to this axis , and the currents in most accelerator magnets are therefore _ longitudinal_. but",
    "actual magnet coils must have radial leads to return the currents and , because of practical considerations , they also have azimuthal currents .    the standard multipole expansion derives entirely from longitudinal magnet currents ( this includes the bound currents in ferromagnets ) .",
    "it is only for a _ long _ magnet whose length @xmath4 is large ( for example compared to a typical radial magnetic half - aperture @xmath5 ) that a single multipole term provides a good approximation to the field . yet , as concerns the effect of the magnet on a particle orbit , a common idealization is the _ short magnet _ or _ thin lens _ approximation , in which the entire deflection caused by the magnet occurs at a single longitudinal position .",
    "even more extreme than our straight line approximation is to treat the transverse orbit coordinates @xmath6 as constant through the entire magnet , body and ends ; the deflection ( say horizontal ) is proportional to a _ field integral _ of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 stands for any one of @xmath9 , that is , either of the transverse magnetic field components , or any of their derivatives with respect to @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 .",
    "commonly then , one defines an _ effective magnet length _ @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "this length is specific to the particular multipole the magnet is designed to produce . in spite of the facts that the magnet must be long to validate the multipole approximation , yet short to validate the thin element treatment , and that discontinuous magnetic fields violate the maxwell s equations , this approximation is curiously accurate for most accelerator magnets .",
    "because of this good start , it promises to be effective to improve upon the approximation by assuming that magnets have ideal multipole fields within the length @xmath14 , but also to include `` end fields '' applicable in regions of length @xmath15 and @xmath16 at input and output ends . in this approximation",
    "the transverse magnetic fields are continuous , but their derivatives are discontinuous at both ends of the fringe field regions .    in a well - designed magnet , the same multipole that is dominant in the central region is dominant in the end regions .",
    "but the fields in the end regions are necessarily more complicated and include longitudinal components @xmath17 .",
    "since the fields in these regions are , in principle , constrained only by maxwell equations , rigorous formulas for the deflections they cause can only be evaluated by solving differential equations appropriate for the detailed magnet end configuration . to obtain analytic formulas",
    "we must make some assumptions , the first of which is that the formulation is not intended to apply to `` intentional solenoids '' ( because of their large azimuthal currents and longitudinal field components ) .",
    "furthermore the only longitudinal fields included are those that are required by maxwell s equation to be present in regions of varying longitudinal profile .",
    "in other words , the formulas can be expected to be accurate for `` well - designed '' magnets , in which the dominant fringe field multipolarity matches the body multipolarity . this can , in principle , be assured by proper shaping of pole ends and proper conformation of the magnet return currents . in the absence of magnetic field measurements in the end regions , this is the only practical assumption one can make when predicting the fringe field deflections .",
    "if the fields _ have _ been accurately measured or calculated , to improve on formulas given in this paper , it would be necessary to separate out the ( presumably small ) extraneous components and include their effects perturbatively .",
    "one can not exclude the possibility of end geometries that introduce multipoles for which the extraneous fringe fields are large compared to the required fringe fields , either intentionally of unintentionally",
    ". the present formalism would not be directly applicable for such fields .    in this paper ,",
    "we derive first approximations for the deflections occurring in the end field regions , of the form @xmath18 and @xmath19  . like the thin lens approximation",
    ", these formulas assume the transverse orbit displacement is constant through the end intervals @xmath15 and @xmath15 .",
    "this is a much more valid assumption than assuming constant displacement through the whole magnet if , as is usually true , the end regions are `` short '' ; @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore terms proportional to transverse slopes @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be consistently included , in the formulas for the deflections .",
    "a criterion for the validity of treating the end region as short can be based on the inequality @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the usual beta functions and their derivatives with respect to the longitudinal position @xmath2 . when this is true the ( fractional ) rate of change of multipole strength @xmath26 is large compared to the ( fractional ) rate of change of lattice beta functions .",
    "there is often a tendency to believe that multipole contributions from opposite ends of a magnet cancel each other .",
    "but , since this is not universally valid , in this paper no such assumption will be made .",
    "in this section , a multipole expansion is developed that is appropriate for performing the calculation just described .",
    "this expansion is applicable to magnetic fields that depend arbitrarily on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath2 but , being a power series in the transverse coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 , its accuracy after truncation to an order @xmath27 deteriorates at large transverse amplitudes .",
    "the expansion is intended to describe an arbitrary `` multipole '' magnet along with its fringe field .",
    "the formalism presented here generalizes an approach described by steffen and reduces to formulas he gives in the case of `` dipoles '' and `` quadrupoles ''  @xcite .    in the current - free regions",
    "to which the beams are restricted , the magnetostatic field @xmath28 can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 an appropriate expansion is @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath34 depend on the longitudinal position @xmath2 can guide the shaping of the pole pieces of iron magnets to match , as closely as possible , equipotentials of @xmath31 .",

    "only one ( or in the case of combined function magnets , two ) of the multipole coefficients will be non - vanishing in the body of the magnet ( length @xmath14 ) and in this region only the @xmath55 terms in the expansions survive .",

    "are mainly concerned with the relative importance of the first two of these terms in the deflections caused by the actual magnet , including body and ends .",

    "this is done in appendix  a.    in the fringe regions of the magnet , the fields can be arranged so that they match the central fields at the ends of the body region and fall linearly to zero in the fringe regions .",

    "the lengths @xmath70 could be determined by best - fitting to measured fringe fields .",
    "but , to reduce the number of parameters in the remainder of this paper , and with some reduction in accuracy , a slightly different approach will be taken ; the impulses delivered by the fringe fields will be evaluated in a way that is independent of the fringe field lengths : all the integrals involved will be computed by using the `` hard - edge '' approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ taking the limit for which @xmath71 . in this limit",
    "the straight line approximation becomes exact .",
    "for the sake of consistency another point must also be made .",
    "since the dominant multipole in the magnet body is also dominant in the fringe field , there can be an appreciable contribution to the dominant field integral ( due to the magnet as a whole ) that comes from the fields in the fringe regions .",
    "it is a matter of taste whether this contribution is to be treated as part of the main field or part of the fringe field . in this paper , from here on , to simplify the formulas somewhat , the term `` fringe field '' will refer to components other than the dominant component , but restricted to those components necessarily associated with the dominant multipole . in other words , the contributions from the dominant multipole component in the fringe regions will be counted as part of the ideal magnet field integral . treating the magnet in this way increases its effective length probably making it",
    "more nearly equal to the the physical magnet length ; _ i.e. _ @xmath72 , and this will be assumed in all subsequent formulas .",

    "the fringe field importance in the case of the sns is striking , especially for quadrupole magnets , whereas in the case of the lhc can be completely neglected .",
    "note that similar results can be derived by careful dynamical analysis and computation of tune - shifts due to fringe fields or dynamic aperture analysis for both the lhc  @xcite and the sns  @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that even the approximate formula for round beams   is slightly pessimisitic and within a factor of 2 of the exact figure of merit .",

    "these results are in agreement with previous crude estimations which employed simple physics arguments based on maxwell laws  @xcite .",
    "finally , the formalism has been applied to the most common cases of multipole magnets , namely normal `` dipoles '' and `` quadrupoles ''  @xcite . since",
    "the straight line approximation has been used throughout , these formulas are only precise for magnetic fields that are well - approximated by step functions ( the `` hard - edge '' approximation ) .",
    "thus , the formulas contain no parameters associated with the fringe shape ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "also , as stated previously , only those fringe fields matching , and therefore required by , the nominal body multipolarity are accounted for",
    ".    numerical evaluation of the end / body figure of merit shows that fringe fields can be neglected in the magnets populating the arcs of large colliders like the lhc . in these rings ,",
    "the magnets are long enough and the emittances are so small ( of the order of @xmath162  m  rad ) that the effect of fringe fields is a tiny perturbation as compared to the dominant multipole errors in the body of the magnets .",
    "the effect may be important , however , in small rings , as the sns accumulator ring  @xcite or the muon collider ring  @xcite , where the emittance is large ( typically @xmath163  m  rad ) and the magnets much shorter .",
    "careful consideration should be also taken in the case of the magnets located in the interaction regions of the collider  @xcite , where the beta variation is quite big .",
    "it is perhaps appropriate to call attention to possible `` overly optimistic '' use of the scaling law . often quadrupoles are grouped in doublets or triplets in which the desired focal properties rely on the intentional , highly - tuned , near cancellation of deflections caused by more than one element . in such cases ,",
    "the fringe deflections are , of course , amplified , when evaluated relative to the gross multiplet deflection .",
    "this effect is most obvious at focal points .    since the early analytical studies of lee - whiting  @xcite and forest  @xcite , significant progress has been achieved for the construction of accurate maps which represent the motion of particles through the magnet fringe field , using either direct numerical evaluation with exact integration of the magnetic field  @xcite or parameter fit of an adequate function  @xcite ( _ e.g. _ the enge function  @xcite ) .",
    "these maps are essential for the study of non - linearities introduced by fringe - fields through hamiltonian perturbation theory techniques . on the other hand",

    "if the fringe fields are found to be important , a thorough numerical modelling and analysis of their effect has to be undertaken , including computation of the amplitude dependent tune - shift , resonance excitation and dynamic aperture  @xcite , as non - linear dynamics can be very sensitive to the details of different lattices and magnet designs .",
