    "this architecture would provide several advantages , since the wires require no or limited control , easing the fabrication requirements and improving their isolation from the environment . for a simpler integration in a solid - state architecture , the wires can be composed of spins . following seminal work by bose  @xcite , which showed that spin chains enable transporting quantum states between the ends of the chain ,",
    "the dynamics of quantum state transfer has been widely studied ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) and protocols for improving the fidelity by coupling engineering  @xcite , dual - rail topologies  @xcite , active control on the chain spins  @xcite or on the end spins only  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "recently these studies have been extended to mixed state spin chains  @xcite , which are more easily obtained in high - temperature laboratory settings  making them important protagonists in practical quantum computing .",
    "a further challenge to experimental implementation of quantum transport is the lack of chains with the desired coupling strengths , since coupling engineering is limited by fabrication constraints and by the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "these challenges highlight the need for a systematic study of mixed state transport in quantum systems beyond chains , including more complex network topologies . these topologies reflect more closely actual experimental conditions as well as systems occurring in nature . for example",
    ", there is remarkable recent evidence  @xcite that coherent quantum transport may be the underlying reason for the high efficiency ( of over 99% ) of photosynthetic energy transfer  @xcite .    to derive explicit conditions for perfect transport we quantify geometric constraints on the unitary propagator that drives transport in an arbitrary network . as a consequence , we find that transferring some mixed states in a network in general requires fewer conditions than pure state transfer .",
    "transport conditions for pure states have been previously quantified  @xcite , however , our method  relying on decomposing the propagator in orthogonal spaces  is fundamentally different and more suitable for mixed states .",
    "perfect transport occurs when the bulk of the network acts like a lens to _ focus _ transport to its ends . to make this physical picture more concrete , we describe mixed state transport as a continuous quantum walk over the network  @xcite that progressively populates its nodes . through this formalism ,",
    "we derive constructive conditions on the hamiltonian that results in the _ correlation _ of transport processes through different possible paths in the network .",
    "the correlation of transport processes leads to their constructive interference at the position of the two end - spins , giving perfect transport .",
    "while similar walk models have been applied to coherent transfer before ( see @xcite for a review ) , our work provides their first extension to transport involving mixed states .    the insight gained by describing quantum transport as correlated quantum walks can be used to construct larger networks where perfect transport is possible .",
    "here we show a strategy to achieve this goal by engineering the coupling strengths between different nodes of the network to construct _ weighted _ spin networks that support perfect mixed state transport .",

    "[ sec : vi ] experimental implementation of quantum information transport requires relaxing many of the assumptions made in ideal schemes . in this paper we analyzed a physical situation that is closer to experimental settings  information transport in mixed - state spin networks with complex topologies .",

    "this description provided a graphical construction to predict the system evolution , which highlighted the need of correlating the transport processes occurring along different paths of the network to obtain perfect transport .",
