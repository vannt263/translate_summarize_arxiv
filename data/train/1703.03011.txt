    "direct measurement of the thickness of the oxide layer as a function of time and potential is hindered by a number of challenges : the dynamic nature of the droplet shape makes measurements via optical techniques ( e.g. ellipsometry ) impractical , and electrical measurements ( impedance ) are complicated by the presence of faradaic reactions . here , we instead use electrochemical measurements to estimate both the average growth and dissolution rates of the oxide layer on the surface with a simple mathematical model .        to model the thickness",
    ", we first estimate the dissolution rate of the oxide ( which we assume to be constant for all @xmath4 ) in 1  m naoh . in regime",
    "a , where the droplets are spheroids , we employ a quasi - steady - state model , where the growth rate and dissolution rate of the oxide are assumed to be of equal magnitude .",
    "these rates are determined by the two variables measured during the experiment : the faradaic current and the 2d projection of the droplet surface area ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the faradaic current allows calculation of the amount of gallium oxidized as a function of time by @xmath73 where @xmath11 represents the current as a function of time , and @xmath74 represents charge transferred .",
    "the charge can be converted to moles of @xmath75 generated by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of electrons transferred in the oxidation reaction and @xmath78 is the faraday constant ( 96485 c / mol ) .",
    "we normalize this growth rate by the surface area of the droplet ; however , @xmath72 is not an accurate representation of the 3d surface area of the droplet @xmath79 in regime a. to estimate the actual surface area , we assume that the droplet is an oblate spheroid when the potential is applied . by measuring the radius of the droplet ( and with the volume already known ) , @xmath79 is determined by the surface area equation for an oblate spheroid @xmath80 where @xmath81 is @xmath82 from these values , the growth rate of the oxide in regime a ( and therefore , the dissolution rate across all regimes ) can be estimated @xmath83 the dissolution rate is assumed constant across regimes .",
    "we verified the dissolution rate by measuring the concentration of gallium ions in solution using atomic absorption spectroscopy ( perkin elmer icp - optical emission spectrometer ) .",
    "the measurements indicate that the calculated and measured value of gallium ions in solution differs by no more than a factor of 2 .",
    "we correlate the current measured in regimes b - d to ascertain the growth rate of oxide for each regime . because the droplets are flat in these regimes",
    ", @xmath72 is a good estimate of the true surface area of the drop .",
    "the thickness of the oxide @xmath84 depends on the relative rates of growth and dissolution , as predicted by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 represent the molecular weight and density of the oxide , respectively .",
    "we note that this model depends on several assumptions : we assume gallium oxide is the dominant species being grown on the surface of the droplet ; however , previous electrochemical studies indicate that gallium hydroxide and gallate salts form on the surface in alkaline solutions .",
    "we also acknowledge that this approach assumes a single value for the average growth ( across the whole surface ) , while visual inspection suggests that the layer is thicker in areas closer to the counter - electrode .",
    "further studies will be necessary to obtain a more quantitative measurement of oxide thickness gradients and their temporal dynamics .",
    "figure  [ fig : oxide ] shows the change in the growth rate as a function of time for the case of regimes b , c , and d. for each regime , the initial increase in the surface area causes a drastic decrease in the growth rate , which ultimately levels to a steady - state value .",
    "figures  [ fig : oxide]b , c ) show that the oxide thickness grows to a maximum of 1 - 4  @xmath14 m .",
    "the maximum oxide layer thickness increases monotonically with electrical potential , and is approximately three orders of magnitude larger than the oxide thickness in air .",
    "we perform a number of control experiments to isolate the key forces ( gravity , surface tension , oxidative stress ) and rule out other possible forces . here",
    ", we provide a summary of these experiments , along with calculations to quantify these forces where possible .",
    "to confirm the presence of oxidative stresses , we wet a liquid metal droplet onto a piece of copper tape , such that lateral spreading can no longer occur . applying the conditions of regime b causes visible buckling of the oxide to appear on the surface of the metal , which is indicative of compressive forces from oxidation ( see movie 5 ) .    to further support the importance of these forces",
    ", we apply up to 3 v potential difference to egain droplets placed in salt water ( 1  m naf ) with a two - electrode system . unlike naoh solutions , the naf does not dissolve the oxide , which allows the metal to form a thick oxide that prevents instabilities .",
    "however , gradually increasing the potential causes the formation of localized protrusions arising from the oxidative stress .",
    "furthermore , these protrusions occur at a lower potential than if the potential is set immediately ( rather than gradually ) to its highest value ( see movie 6 ) .",
    "electrostatic forces have been shown to actuate liquid metal toward a counter electrode . despite these forces , we find that positioning the counter electrode in solution above the droplet still results in outward - spreading even though any electrical forces would point inward and upward ( movie 7 ) .",
    "we determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force relative to gravity by tilting the apparatus .",
    "this introduces a lateral gradient , and the angle at which the gravitational force exceeds the electrostatic force is an upper estimate of the value of the electrostatic forces . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta ] , the average displacement of the droplet s leading edge changes sharply above @xmath91 . at this angle ,",
    "@xmath92 which is lower than all calculated gravitational pressures and is therefore a negligible effect . as an additional test , we find that decreasing the inner radius of the counter - electrode from 7.6 cm to 3.2 cm ( increasing the electric field ) not alter the spreading behavior of the droplet .",
    "another possible explanation of the behavior of regime b is lateral stresses caused by electrostriction . in the case of electrostriction",
    ", the oxide would act as a dielectric in a capacitor , with charges on either side acting to compress the oxide , which could create lateral forces to cause spreading .",
    "this force can be estimated by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the dielectric permittivity of the oxide layer ( which we assume to be @xmath95 m@xmath96 kg@xmath97 s@xmath98 a@xmath99 ) . even assuming an oxide layer thickness of 3 nm and an applied potential of 1 v , this force remains lower than the yield stress of the oxide layer ( 5 mpa vs. 30 mpa , according to parallel plate rheological measurements that quantify the yield stress of the native oxide @xcite ) ; additionally , the oxide thickness grows more quickly than the potential , indicating that this force is smaller at higher potentials .",
    "these calculations indicate that electrostriction is , by itself , unikely to be the driving force of regime b.      l droplet .",
    "the solid line is for a droplet brought immediately to @xmath100  v , while the dashed line is for a droplet brought to this same value at a rate of @xmath101  mv / s from the open circuit potential . ]    in all regimes , the droplet starts as a sphere and spreads upon application of an electric potential @xmath4 .",
    "however , this spreading also takes place under the influence of a small amount of inertia , which provides an effective pressure of @xmath102  pa where @xmath103  cp @xmath104 is the measured velocity at the leading edge . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inertia ] , these inertial forces are not the primary driver of spreading , but do influence the initial dynamics , including a small overshoot effect .",
    "these overshoot effects are likely also influenced by the dynamics of oxide deposition , which depends on the thickness of the oxide and therefore the way potential is applied to the metal ( e.g. step change or sweep ) ."

    "<S> [ fig : exp ] shows spreading of approximately @xmath41 the initial area of the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> the droplet surface becomes less shiny during this process , particularly around the droplet perimeter , indicating the presence of a rough surface oxide . a substantial decrease in interfacial tension , as is known to occur in the presence of oxides @xcite , is sufficient to explain the observed fingering instabilities . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : pl ] , this implies a conservative upper bound @xmath43  mn / m . </S>",
    "<S> the low interfacial tension is also evidenced by the shape of the branches and undulations , which exhibit both positive and negative radii of curvature .    in its final stages of spreading </S>",
    "<S> , the droplet thins to the point where one or more branches pinch off into small satellite droplets . </S>",
    "<S> if these satellite droplets lose their electrical contact , then their oxide layer dissolves , they become shiny in appearance , and their ( now high ) interfacial tension causes the liquid to bead up into a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> if the satellite droplets happen to reattach to the electrode , the metal can begin spreading again from this new site .    at larger values of @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , the droplet eventually grows a thicker oxide layer , which halts both the spreading and the development of the undulations ; this is regime c. instead of branching into a fractal , the droplet in fact _ contracts _ after about 10 seconds of initial spreading and undulating ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : sampledata]b ) . at still higher values of @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the oxide growth is sufficiently rapid that the metal stops spreading before any undulations develop ; this is regime d and also exhibits the surprising contraction .    the areal contraction of the metal in regimes c and d provides a key insight into the fractal fingering observed in regime b. the instabilities in regime b are only possible for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> yet , in regimes c and d the retraction is only possible for non - zero @xmath3 ; based on the height of the retracted droplets ( @xmath45  mm ) , we estimate a lower bound of @xmath46  mn / m . </S>",
    "<S> thus , surface activity of the oxide indeed lowers the tension of the metal ( from @xmath1  mn / m in the case of bare metal to as low as @xmath46  mn / m ) , but this drop is not sufficient to enable the instabilities in regime b. after ruling out additional forces such as elasticity , electrostatics , electrostriction , and inertia based on either calculations or experimental observations ( see supp . mat . ) , we determined that oxidative forces help drive instabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of anodic growth of oxides in aluminum @xcite have shown compressive oxidative stresses on the order of 0.1 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> based on the size of the droplets ( @xmath47  mm ) , this would correspond to a force / length of approximately @xmath48  n / m ; this force is more than enough to exceed the force provided by the interfacial tension of the metal at this scale ( 0.1 n / m ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the _ effective _ interfacial tension is the sum of the surface activity of the fluid ( tensile ) and the opposing ( compressive ) stresses from the oxidation process . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , such stresses are consistent with the fan - shaped protrusions observed on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the oxide buckles when the liquid metal ( under regime b conditions ) is laterally - confined , consistent with the presence of compressive forces . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : sampledata]c ) provide additional insight into the role of the oxide . in both regime c and d </S>",
    "<S> , the contraction of the droplet corresponds to a rapid increase in electrical resistance ( @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we associate this increase primarily with the thickening oxide layer , consistent with previous impedance @xcite and resistance measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the contribution of the ( compressive ) oxidative stress to the effective interfacial tension diminishes when the oxide gets too thick . as a result , the droplets contract in regime c and d due to the non - zero tension of the metal within the oxide .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sampledata]c shows that spreading only occurs at low resistance ( i.e. when ions can easily pass through the oxide ) and that it does not for higher resistance . </S>",
    "<S> note that the largest values of @xmath53 occur in regime a. while this might be surprising since the oxide is thinnest for low @xmath4 , these are non - ohmic resistances . </S>",
    "<S> we reason that the oxidative stress that drives regime b is possible since the potential is larger than regime a , yet the oxide is thinner than in regimes c and d ( see supp mat ) .    as a point of clarification , liquid metals </S>",
    "<S> have also been observed to migrate towards a counter electrode @xcite . while this might suggest the importance of electrostatic forces , our experiments suggest otherwise . positioning the counter electrode in solution directly above the droplet </S>",
    "<S> still results in outward - spreading even though the field lines are largely vertical . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , repeating the experiment with a counter electrode ring of half the diameter did not change the behavior of the regimes . however , replacing the circular counter electrode with a point - source placed to the side of the liquid metal caused it to migrate toward the counter electrode . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that this translational motion is driven by marangoni forces arising from gradients in tension rather than electrostatic forces . </S>",
