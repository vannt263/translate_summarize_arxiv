    "this is due partly to the lack of precise structure function data for @xmath12 and mainly due to the fact that the data included in global analyses actually probe the quark distribution , while the gluon density is constrained by the @xmath13 dependence of the data , that is by the evolution . in the low @xmath2 region",

    "note that the recent gluon from the mrst nnlo analysis  @xcite receives sizeable corrections both in size and shape compared to the nlo fit , signalling a large uncertainty of the gluon in this regime . in this context",
    "it is also interesting to note that the gluon as obtained from global fits can significantly change , both in normalisation and shape , if small @xmath2 resummations are incorporated into the analysis  @xcite .",
    "data for the exclusive @xmath1 process offer an attractive opportunity to determine the low @xmath2 gluon density in this @xmath11 domain , since here the gluon couples _ directly _ to the charm quark and the cross section is proportional to the gluon density _ squared _  @xcite .",
    "therefore the data are much more sensitive to the behaviour of the gluon .",
    "the mass of the @xmath17 vector meson introduces a relatively large scale , amenable to the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) description not only of large @xmath11 diffractive electroproduction , but also photoproduction of @xmath0 . the available @xmath0 data probe the gluon at a scale @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 gev@xmath16 for @xmath2 in the range @xmath20 ; that is just the domain where other data do not constrain the gluon reliably , see fig .",

    "to lowest order the @xmath22 amplitude can be factored into the product of the @xmath23 transition , the scattering of the @xmath17 system on the proton via ( colourless ) two - gluon exchange , and finally the formation of the @xmath24 from the outgoing @xmath17 pair .",
    "the crucial observation is that at high @xmath25 centre - of - mass energy , @xmath26 , the scattering on the proton occurs over a much shorter timescale than the @xmath23 fluctuation or the @xmath24 formation times , see fig .",

    "the integral over the charm quark loop is expressed in terms of the electronic width , @xmath31 , of @xmath0 , and the @xmath40 term in the final brackets reflects the contribution of the longitudinally polarised incoming @xmath41 .",

    "thus it becomes possible to extract the gluon density @xmath38 directly from the measured diffractive @xmath0 cross section .",

    "the relativistic corrections were intensively discussed in  @xcite .",

    "the contribution coming from @xmath68 is written in terms of the integrated gluon @xmath69 , that is the infrared part is absorbed into the input distribution at the ` transition ' scale @xmath70 .",
    "of course , at low @xmath11 the gluon extracted from a global analysis may be affected by the presence of absorptive corrections which are usually neglected . here",
    ", the absorptive corrections are expected to be smaller .",
    "the transverse size , @xmath71 , of the @xmath72 dipole produced by the ` heavy ' photon in dis has a logarithmic distribution @xmath73 starting from @xmath74 up to some hadronic scale . in the case of @xmath24 production the size of the @xmath17 dipole",
    "is limited by the size of the @xmath24 meson .",
    "even in photoproduction it is of the order of @xmath75 .",
    "since the probability of rescattering is proportional to @xmath76 , we anticipate a much smaller absorptive effect .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the nlo corrections was done in  @xcite .",
    "part of these corrections generates the running of @xmath77 , while part is similar to gluon reggeization in the bfkl approach .",
    "indeed , for @xmath24 electroproduction it was shown  @xcite using the conventional collinear factorisation scheme , that there is a nlo correction of the form  ( ) ( ) .",
    "[ eq : dlog ] in the @xmath36 factorisation approach such a correction may be included by replacing the @xmath37-channel gluon by the reggeized gluon .",
    "however this correction vanishes with a natural choice of the factorisation scale , @xmath63 , which was adopted in our prescription  @xcite .",
    "one therefore has reason to believe that the @xmath36 factorisation approach accounts for a major part of the nlo effect , and that the resulting ` nlo ' gluon may be compared to that in a set of nlo global partons .",
    "regularization scheme .",
    "our partons should also be considered to be in the @xmath78 scheme , since we use the @xmath78 definition of @xmath77 , and moreover the factorisation scale which provides the cancellation of the @xmath79 correction is also specified in the @xmath78 scheme . ]",
    "therefore we shall refer to the resulting distributions as nlo gluons .",
    "one also needs to account for the fact that the two gluons exchanged carry different fractions @xmath80 of the light - cone proton momentum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiagram ] .",
    "that is one has to use the generalised ( skewed ) gluon distribution . )",
    "description this should be considered as a nlo correction to the evolution of @xmath57 . since we do not consider the evolution , but just parametrise the scale dependence of the gluons ( see below ) , this correction is outside our analysis . ] in our case @xmath81 , and the skewing effect can be well estimated from  @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83/\\partial\\ln x$ ] .",
    "that is in the small @xmath2 region of interest we take the gluon to have the form @xmath84 .",
    "recall that the integral ( [ eq : nlointegral ] ) was written for the discontinuity ( i.e. for the imaginary part ) of the amplitude shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiagram ] . the real part may be determined using a dispersion relation . in the low @xmath2 region , for our positive - signature amplitude @xmath85 , the dispersion relation can be written in the form @xmath86    both corrections lead to an enhancement of the cross section .",
    "in the following , we present fits to the data for exclusive @xmath24 production from hera using the perturbative description discussed above .    in the low @xmath2 region it is expected that the @xmath2 dependence of the gluon density @xmath87 is well approximated by the form @xmath88 .",
    "however , the evolution in @xmath11 modifies this behaviour , enlarging the power @xmath89 as @xmath11 increases .",
    "in particular , in the double leading log ( dll ) approximation , we have the asymptotic form x g ~ ( ) .",
    "thus we need a @xmath11 dependent parametrisation . however , in the limited region of @xmath11 covered by the exclusive @xmath0 data , it is sufficient to use a simple parametric form xg(x,^2 )  =  n x^-  = a + b(^2/0.45  gev^2 ) .",

    ". however , they lead to similar results for the gluon . as the combined fit is very satisfactory ( @xmath93 )",

    "recall that the scale dependence of the power @xmath89 was generated by the evolution of the form @xmath100 .",

    "[ parameters ] , our simple ansatz for the form of the gluon , @xmath84 , using an @xmath2 independent power @xmath89 , works very well . to quantify the @xmath2 and @xmath11 behaviour , we tabulate the values of the power of the gluon , @xmath89 , from ( [ eq : gluonansatznlo ] ) at four @xmath11 values , compared to values estimated from mrst2004nlo  @xcite and cteq6.5 m gluons  @xcite ( tab .",
    "[ lambda ] ) . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo ] and tab .",
    "[ lambda ] , our nlo gluon fit seems to be incompatible with the strength of evolution of the mrst global fit ( e.g. at @xmath67 our gluon increases by a factor @xmath114 from @xmath115 to @xmath116 gev@xmath16 compared to @xmath117 for the mrst2004nlo gluon ) ; however , there is fair agreement in the evolution between our gluon and the cteq fit ( cteq evolves by a factor @xmath118 in the same regime , although in absolute normalisation our nlo @xmath0 prediction for the gluon agrees , on average , much better with the mrst nlo prediction ) .",
    "of course , this should be seen in light of the large uncertainties of both the mrst and cteq gluons at small @xmath2 and scales , see figs .",
    "[ fig : globalgluons ] and [ fig : nlo ] .",
    "this uncertainty persists at the largest scales probed in our fit .",
    "as these scales are rather low , the accuracy of the dglap approach may already be seriously affected by small @xmath2 effects and absorptive and power suppressed corrections .",
    "of course , in the @xmath36 factorisation approach there is some uncertainty arising from the infrared cut - off @xmath70 , below which we can not consider the @xmath36 integration literally .",
    "we have to express this low @xmath36 contribution in terms of the gluon integrated over @xmath119 up to @xmath53 .",
    "however , with our prescription for unintegrated partons , these two contributions match smoothly to each other .",
    "the ambiguity due to the choice of @xmath70 is quite small , as illustrated by the closeness of the dotted lines to our nlo gluons in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo ] .",
    "note that the difference between the lo and nlo gluons is large at the smallest @xmath2 values , both in the global parton analyses and for the gluons obtained from elastic @xmath24 production . for the global analyses this is due to the absence of the photon - gluon coefficient function at lo . at lo , the photon couples only to the quark parton , which is produced from a gluon at some scale @xmath120 , due to the strong ordering in @xmath36 . at low @xmath2 the gluon grows with @xmath121 , and , to provide the measured values of the proton structure function @xmath122 , we need a much larger gluon distribution in the lo formalism . at nlo",
    "the photon - gluon coefficient function is present , which provides a direct photon - gluon parton coupling at the scale @xmath11 , and , more importantly , a @xmath123 divergence appears in the quark - gluon splitting function , which accelerates the quark evolution and in turn requires less gluon . in elastic @xmath24 production",
    "we have an analogous situation . by carrying out the @xmath36 integration",
    ", we include the interaction with the gluon at large scales of the order of @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , part of this integral has @xmath125 , and may be regarded as one step of backward evolution . in summary , in dglap analyses based on collinear factorisation , the large change in the gluon distribution in going from lo to nlo is due to the strong ordering in @xmath36 and the absence of an additional loop integral in the lo coefficient function and parton evolution .",
    "inclusion of higher - order terms beyond nlo is expected to give a much smaller effect .",
    "they will mainly affect the normalisation and not the @xmath2 dependence of the gluon .",
    "the higher - order corrections in our approach are @xmath126 , but may be enhanced by large logarithms .",
    "the corrections which are enhanced by @xmath127 , and which may lead to some @xmath2 dependence , are absorbed in the form of the gluon distribution by choosing the appropriate factorisation scale @xmath63 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlog ] ) .",
    "then , in our nlo approach , the part of the @xmath36 integral which may be logarithmically large , is accounted for explicitly in the @xmath36 factorisation formalism which is used to obtain the @xmath36 integral .",
    "after this , those higher - order corrections , which are not included in the @xmath36 integral , are concentrated in the domain @xmath128 .",
    "thus the scale dependence of these higher - order corrections is driven mainly by the scale dependence of the running of @xmath77 which we take into account .",
    "the fact that the gluons obtained from our analysis turn out to be close to the gluon distributions coming from the global analyses for @xmath129 , where they are fairly stable , indicates that the omitted higher - order corrections are indeed small .",
    "photoproduction , using our lo and nlo gluon , compared to data .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the error band of the lo prediction , whereas the shaded band is our nlo prediction .",
    "the data points are the published zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite results , and the preliminary results from zeus  @xcite.,width=453 ]    we have extended our framework to predict elastic @xmath21 photoproduction , using our lo and nlo gluon with our cross section formulae including corrections and @xmath65 factor , see fig .",
    "[ fig : upsilon ] .",
    "although the data is sparse , the cross section predictions are reasonable .",
    "we conclude that this new information coming from our nlo analysis of elastic @xmath24 production data , in which the @xmath130 couple _ directly _ to the low @xmath2 gluon parton and where the cross section is proportional to the _ square _ of the gluon , is especially valuable to constrain the small @xmath2 behaviour of the gluon distribution .",
    "the accuracy of the elastic @xmath24 data is now sufficient , as indicated by the error bands ( arising from the experimental uncertainties ) on the extracted gluon distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo ] , to improve our knowledge of the gluon distribution at small @xmath2 , @xmath131 , considerably .",
    "this is in comparison to the small @xmath2 behaviour of the ` global ' gluon distributions , which is not well constrained by the inclusive dis structure function data .",
