    "in theories with a simple scalar field and an @xmath6 invariant self - interaction potential , is possible to find stable topological kinks interpolating asymptotically between the minima of the system . if additionally extra dimensions are considered and gravitation is included then the kink or domain wall interpolates between two anti de - sitter ( ads ) spacetimes and induces the standard gravitational interaction on the four - dimensional sector of the scenario @xcite .",
    "such scenarios are referred to as brane - worlds and it is surmised that the standard model fields should be localized on the topological defect @xcite .    as a first approximation to a scenario where the symmetry group of the standard model can be recovered inside the domain wall , in absence of gravity but in presence of a non - abelian symmetry ,",
    "kink solutions have been obtained in several opportunities .",
    "for example , a non - abelian scalar field interpolating between the minima of an @xmath7 invariant potential is found in refs .",
    "moreover , three kink solutions to an @xmath0 theory with a fourth order potential , all of them inducing asymptotically the breaking symmetry @xmath1 , are determined in ref .",
    "other models in terms of @xmath8 group are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the extension of these scenarios to the curved case is an issue that , far as we know , only has been address in two occasions , see refs .",
    "@xcite where , besides to find the gravitational version of the @xmath9 kink solution reported in refs .",
    "@xcite the perturbative stability is evaluated . among those results",
    "highlights the four - dimensional localization of nambu - goldstone bosons @xcite ( massless scalar excitations ) associated to symmetry group inside the kink which is an effect generated by the curvature of the spacetime . precisely in this effect",
    "we want to focus in this work .",
    "our proposal consist in consider the four - dimensional localization of the non - abelian scalar excitations of other scenarios different to the determined ones in ref .",
    "for such purpose , among the options mentioned above we set the @xmath0 kinks of the ref .",
    "@xcite because both the extension to gravitation and the stability analysis are similar to the ones carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , the properties of @xmath0 group , as we will see later , affect of different ways the confinement of the scalar excitations ( in addition to the nambu - goldstone bosons other massless scalar perturbations appear on the wall even in absence of gravity . )",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ solutions ] the gravitational setup for the @xmath0 kink is presented ; a sixth order higgs potential is considered in order to find self - gravitating kink solutions . in section [ excitations ] ,",
    "we focus in the four - dimensional localization of zero modes of the non - abelian scalar excitations .",
    "finally , in section [ summary ] our results and conclusions are summered and presented .",
    "consider the einstein - scalar field coupled system in five - dimensions @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a scalar field in the 45 adjoin representation of @xmath0 which transforms @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the parameters and generators of the group respectively and @xmath16 .",
    "in particular for the generators we have @xmath17    to find kink solutions a sixth order potential without odd terms is selected , @xmath18 actually , both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are vanishes because the field is antisymmetric ; thus , the reflexion symmetry , @xmath21 , is part of the model and the breaking of @xmath0 group _ via _ a kink is feasible . to details about @xmath6 symmetry and @xmath0 group see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , for the field we consider now , for the field we consider ( here and everywhere take @xmath22 as @xmath23 in @xmath24 ) @xmath25 such that in the gravitational background determined by @xmath26 we have ( prime indicates derivative with respect to extra coordinate ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 from ( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ eqfield ] ) respectively .    from ( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ eqfield ] ) respectively and for @xmath29 .",
    "in order to uncouple ( [ eccso(10 ) ] ) we set ( for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 non - vanish is possible to find numerical solutions , however we are interested in exact solutions which can be obtained taking the three parameters as zero ) @xmath33 and for @xmath34\\ ] ] three kink solutions can be found , all of them sharing the same boundary condition at @xmath35 @xmath36 but differentiated among them by the boundary condition at @xmath37 @xmath38 details about ( [ vacio- ] ) and ( [ vacios+ ] ) can be checked in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath39 , compatible with the boundary condition ( [ vacio- ] ) and the first condition of ( [ vacios+ ] ) , we get the symmetric kink which has a single component and is determined by @xmath40 with @xmath41    on the other hand , for @xmath42 in correspondence with the condition ( [ vacio- ] ) and the second condition of ( [ vacios+ ] ) , the asymmetric kink is obtained and in this case the scalar field has two components , @xmath43 where @xmath44    finally , for @xmath45 a solution associated both to the boundary condition ( [ vacio- ] ) and to the third condition of ( [ vacios+ ] ) is recovered , the superasymmetric kink , which , as in the previous case , has two directions @xmath46 where @xmath47    in the three cases , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are orthogonal generators of @xmath0 and the parameters @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are given by @xmath52 such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constrained as follows @xmath55    the solutions ( [ a ] ) , ( [ b ] ) and ( [ c ] ) are the gravitational extensions of the @xmath0 kinks found in ref . @xcite and correspond to warped spacetimes asymptotically ads@xmath56 with cosmological constant respectively determined by @xmath57    now , regarding the symmetry breaking induced by the non - abelian kinks , in correspondence with ( [ vacio- ] ) and ( [ vacios+ ] ) , at @xmath58 , @xmath9 is the remaining gauge symmetry induced for each kink ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; and clearly , at @xmath59 , this group is embedded in different manners in @xmath0 .    in @xmath60 , by contrast , the remaining groups are completely different . for the symmetric kink we have the vanish matrix for the field and",
    "automatically each @xmath0 generator annihilates the field . to the other scenarios the situation is more interesting . for the asymmetric kink we get on diagonal of the field an @xmath61 and an @xmath62 vanish and non - vanish block respectively and for the last scenario , superasymmetrc kink , on the diagonal of the field , both an @xmath63 vanish block and an @xmath64 non - vanish block",
    "are obtained .    to find the remain symmetry in the core of each scenario three basis for @xmath0",
    "are required such that the first of them includes to @xmath65 , the second one to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and the third one to @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "fortunately , these basis share 40 generators which are determined by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a normalization factor and @xmath72 a linear combination coefficient which is selected according to @xmath73 for @xmath74 ; @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "finally @xmath77 and @xmath78    on the other hand , such basis are distinguished by the following generators set for the symmetric , asymmetric and superasymmetric case respectively @xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81    to indicate the remaining group in @xmath60 , we will focus in the last two configurations since for the first one the result is straightforward .    for the asymmetric scenario ,",
    "@xmath82 generators annihilate the field in @xmath60 : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ; @xmath88 ; @xmath89 .",
    "the first 15 generators form a basis for @xmath90 , the following 3 ones are the generators of @xmath91 and the last one together with @xmath92 and @xmath93 are a basis for @xmath94 .    with regarding the superasymmetric kink we have @xmath95 generators annihilating the field in @xmath60 : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98,@xmath99,@xmath100 ; @xmath101 ; @xmath102 .",
    "in this case , the first 15 are associated to @xmath103 and the two remaining ones in correspondence with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , in the core of ( [ a ] ) , ( [ b ] ) and ( [ c ] ) respectively we have @xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath108    established the non - abelian scenarios , we continue with the four - dimensional localization of the scalar excitations .",
    "let @xmath109 and @xmath110 be solutions to the einstein scalar field equations ( [ einstein ] , [ eqfield ] ) .",
    "now , consider small deviations to @xmath109 and @xmath12 defined for @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "then , in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite from ( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ eqfield ] ) a pair the coupled equations for the excitations is obtained @xmath113 and @xmath114    now , taking into account the generalization of the bardeen formalism to the case of warped geometries presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the decomposition of @xmath111 in terms of tensor , vector and scalar modes , namely @xmath115 such that @xmath116    under infinitesimal coordinate transformation @xmath117 it is a fact that both @xmath111 and @xmath118 are not invariant variables , @xmath119 where @xmath120 thus , in consistency with ( [ barhab ] ) and ( [ barvarphi ] ) we get @xmath121 and @xmath122    remarkably , @xmath123 is invariant under ( [ infinitesimal ] ) and precisely we would like to replicate this property in the other fields . actually , the system of equations ( [ gravfluctuation ] , [ scalarfluctuation ] ) can be rewritten in terms of three gauge - invariant variables : a vector field and two scalar fields , defined by @xmath124 in addition , a gauge - invariant variable can be also defined for the non - abelian scalar fluctuation @xmath125    now , fixing gauge @xcite , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , where additionally @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and considering conformal coordinates , @xmath132 , after uncoupling we get @xmath133 and @xmath134 and the following constrains for the scalar fields @xmath135    as expected , from the point of view of a four - dimensional observer , a massless bound state for the gravitons is determined while for the vector field a normalizable solution is not feasible @xcite .    with regarding the scalar fluctuations , we define @xmath136 and @xmath137 such that for @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively is obtained @xmath140 and @xmath141 where @xmath142 and clearly the eigenvalues both of @xmath138 and of @xmath139 are positives , namely @xmath143 , and they come in pairs .",
    "in addition , in none of the towers of eigenfunctions a normalizable massless state is found which is to be expected because , when gravity is switched off , this massless mode correspond to the translational mode of the flat space @xmath0 kink @xcite .",
    "now , for @xmath144 but with @xmath145 we get @xmath146 with @xmath147 where @xmath148 which is diagonal for each of the basis indicated in previous section .",
    "the gravitational contribution is present in all of terms of ( [ vq ] ) . in particular , for a domain wall , the first two terms provide a volcano potential and the last one is a barrier of potential , @xmath149 , deformed by the contributions of the non - abelian scalar field , @xmath150 ; so , this term has the information about the effect of the group structure in the confinement of the scalar perturbations .",
    "therefore , to distinguish between the effect generated by the gravitation and the produced one by the symmetry group is necessary to refer to the corresponding flat case and to compare results .",
    "for the flat case , take into account that , when the gravity is switched off , we return to get ( [ scalar2 ] ) but with @xmath151 and @xmath152 in addition , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 must be considered @xcite .     generated from ( [ ddv1 ] ) .",
    "( dashed line ) @xmath156 obtained from ( [ ddv2]).,width=264 ]      for this scenario the symmetry group is preserved on the kink ; however , from ( [ scalar2 ] ) we find a massless states localized for each @xmath157 .    by defining ( both for this scenarios and for the other ones ) @xmath158 from ( [ ddv ] )",
    "we have respectively along @xmath159 and @xmath160 , with @xmath161 @xmath162 and @xmath163 hence , in both cases @xmath156 is a volcano potential ( see fig.[volcanos ] . in all figures",
    "the graphics are plotted in conformal coordinates considering @xmath164 ) and as a result a massless bound states along @xmath165 is expected .    in the flat case , for each set of generators respectively we have @xmath166 and @xmath167 which support a normalizable massless mode for each @xmath165 , the analogous ones of the gravitational case . notice that both ( [ vqf1 ] ) and ( [ vqf2 ] ) are pschl - teller potentials @xcite with a normalizable ground state confined in four - dimensions .      for @xmath168 ,",
    "six cases are found .",
    "along @xmath169 and @xmath170 , all of them associated to @xmath90 group , we find ( [ ddv1 ] ) and ( [ ddv2 ] ) respectively ; so , a massless bound state in the direction of each of those generators is expected .",
    "similarly , when the gravity is switched off we find the normalizable modes analogous to the gravitational ones since ( [ vqf1 ] ) and ( [ vqf2 ] ) respectively for each generators set are recovered .",
    "on the other hand , for the generators in correspondence with @xmath171 and @xmath172 , namely , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , we have @xmath175 for the gravitational case and @xmath176 for the flat case .",
    "hence , in both cases @xmath177 and the spectrum of eigenvalues of ( [ scalar2 ] ) is defined for @xmath143 .    with regarding the broken generators associated to ( [ s2 ] ) , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and two more from @xmath182 , @xmath183 ; twenty six in total , we find @xmath184 for first and second generators set ( plus signs for the first set , minus signs for the second set ) and @xmath185 for the last two generators .    in each of the cases identified for the broken generators , we obtain an identical @xmath156 to the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the gravitational background is similar to ( [ metric ] , [ warp ] ) but the symmetry group is @xmath7 .",
    "so , from ( [ ddv4 ] ) and ( [ ddv5 ] ) respectively an asymmetric ( see fig.[volcanoaf ] solid line ) and symmetric volcano potential is determined ; and as a result ; in the tower of eigenfunctions of ( [ scalar2 ] ) a normalizable massless mode is expected .",
    "when comparing with the flat scenario , where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are recovered , we noticed that the gravitation of the scenario favours the four - dimensional localization of these modes ; in absence of this one , ( [ ddv41 ] ) ( see fig.[volcanoaf ] dashed line ) and ( [ ddv51 ] ) do not support a normalizable zero mode .",
    "generated from ( [ ddv4 ] ) when gravity is switched on .",
    "( dashed line ) @xmath156 determined from ( [ ddv41 ] ) when gravity is switched off.,width=264 ]      for @xmath188 four cases are found . both in the direction of the 15 generators of @xmath103 and in the direction of @xmath69 , generator of @xmath105 , we have ( [ ddv3 ] ) .",
    "hence , there are not normalizable massless states along these generators .",
    "this also happens in flat case where ( [ ddv31 ] ) is obtained .    for the broken generators associated to ( [ s3 ] ) , ( [ ddv4 ] ) is obtained both for @xmath189 ( minus sings ) and for @xmath190 ( plus sings ) with @xmath191 .",
    "on the other hand , we get ( [ ddv5 ] ) for @xmath192 with @xmath193 .",
    "thus , along the broken basis massless bound states are found .",
    "remarkably , in absence of gravity the analogous modes are not normalizable since ( [ ddv41 ] ) and ( [ ddv51 ] ) are recovered .",
    "just as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found massless scalar states localized in the core of each @xmath0 scenario shown here . however , in addition to nambu - goldstone bosons expected other light scalar excitations are confined .",
    "the results are summered as follows .    for the first scenario ,",
    "the @xmath0 group is preserved on the kink ; nevertheless , we find scalar zero modes trapped by the wall .",
    "this effect is also shared by the second scenario where , inside the kink , @xmath194 and scalar massless fluctuations are localized along 14 generators of @xmath90 . on the other hand , for the third scenario",
    ", the symmetry pattern @xmath195 is recovered on the kink and along the broken generators we get scalar zero modes confined .",
    "this last one also happens inside the second configuration .",
    "after this comparison we noticed that , in addition to scalar states confined along broken generators ( nambu - goldstone bosons trapped by the thick brane ) , in the direction of the unbroken generators , with the exception of @xmath196 , we have scalar massless modes both localized and non - localized ; and it is a fact that , while the bound states are along the basis of @xmath197 group , the non - confined ones are along the basis of @xmath198 group . the asymmetric configuration , unlike the other ones , is a scenario where all these effects can be simultaneously observed : localized states along the @xmath90 generators , non - localized states along the basis both @xmath199 and @xmath172 , and nambu - goldstone fields trapped inside the kink .    by considering our results and the found ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , the four - dimensional localization of the nambu - goldstone bosons associated to unbroken group inside the non - abelian kink is a gravitational effect expected in these scenarios ( in absence of gravity they are not normalizable ) .",
    "furthermore , in our opinion , the properties of @xmath197 group , unlike the properties of @xmath198 group , could be favouring the confinement the scalar zero modes along the unbroken generators .",
