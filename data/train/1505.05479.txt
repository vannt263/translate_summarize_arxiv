    "there has been interest in identifying a variational principle basis for non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ( nesm ) . on the one hand ,",
    "phenomenological dynamics is well established .",
    "it consists of : ( a ) phenomenological relationships , such as ohm s law of electrical current flow , fick s law of diffusion , fourier s law of conduction , the newtonian law of viscosity , combined with ( b ) conservation laws , such kirchoff s current relationship , or similar relationships for flows of mass or heat .",
    "the combinations of relationships of types ( a ) and ( b ) leads to well - known dynamical equations such as the navier - stokes and burgers equations of hydrodynamics or the diffusion and smoluchowski equations , as elucidated in standard textbooks @xcite .",
    "however , the search for a microscopic statistical basis for these relationships has been more challenging ; see for example  @xcite .",
    "while there have been many powerful and important methods for particular calculations , including the langevin equation , master equation , fokker - planck and smoluchowski equations and others , nevertheless so far , there has been no foundational basis for nesm that provides the same power that the second law of thermodynamics provides for equilibria @xcite . indeed ,",
    "multiple context dependent variational principles have been proposed for nesm , such as minimum entropy production @xcite , maximum entropy production @xcite , and minimum energy dissipation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a general variational quantity remains illusive .",
    "a common basis in the above principles is to begin with the ` state entropy ' , @xmath0 where the @xmath1 s are the populations of equilibrium states @xmath2 .",
    "then , a ` local equilibrium ' assumption is made that @xmath3 , which is fundamentally only defined in the context of an extremum principle for predicting equilibrium , can also be a useful predictor near equilibrium .",
    "then the entropy production is defined as @xmath4 to determines rates of approach to equilibrium or of dissipation in steady states .",
    "one major drawback of the above methods is that they usually do not provide a natural quantifier for closeness to equilibrium ; there is no systematic way to improve the near equilibrium predictions in terms of an expansion parameter . here",
    ", we describe an approach based on path entropies , not state entropies , that does not have these problems , is applicable even far from equilibrium , has expansion parameters , and happens to give very simple routes to deriving properties of nesm .",
    "a goal of nesm has been to find a variational quantity which can be maximized while imposing suitable dynamical constraints .",
    "such an approach goes beyond phenomenological descriptions of only average forces and flows and explains fluctuating quantities and higher moments of dynamical properties as well . in 1980 , e.t .",
    "jaynes proposed a candidate nesm variational principle called ` maximum caliber ' ( max cal ) @xcite .",
    "we and others have explored its applicability as a general foundation for nesm  @xcite . here , we demonstrate that major results of nesm can be derived from assuming that max cal is a general foundational principle , these results are the green - kubo relations , onsager reciprocal relations , and a generalized prigogine s principle .",
    "for concreteness , we consider a discrete - time discrete - state system with two types of fluxes : of ` stuff ' @xmath5 and ` stuff ' @xmath6 .",
    "examples of @xmath5 and @xmath6 include heat , mass , electrical charge , momentum .",
    "we allow for the coupling between the two fluxes ; the flux of @xmath5 may depend in any way on the flux of @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the system reaches a macroscopic nonequilibrium stationary state after a long time after it has been coupled to gradients across its boundaries that set up the fluxes .",
    "figure [ figureaa ] illustrates with an example of coupled heat and particle flows in one dimension .",
    "suppose the system has @xmath7 discrete states @xmath8 .",
    "let us define an ensemble @xmath9 of stationary - state micro - trajectories @xmath10 of fixed duration .",
    "the duration of the trajectories is not important , so we keep it unspecified .",
    "based on how the system is coupled to the gradients and the internal structure of the system , each micro - trajectory @xmath11 will correspond to a specific value of flux @xmath12 of type @xmath5 ( and @xmath6 ) at any time @xmath13 .",
    "the ensemble average of the flux @xmath14 of quantity @xmath5 at time @xmath13 is then given by @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the probability of trajectory @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear that different probability distributions @xmath16 could lead to macroscopic fluxes @xmath14 and @xmath17 .",
    "the strategy of max cal is to seek the particular probability distribution @xmath16 that maximizes the path entropy and is otherwise consistent with the ensemble averaged fluxes @xmath14 and @xmath17 for all times @xmath13 .",
    "we maximize the path entropy or the caliber , @xmath18 subject to normalization and flux constraints . here , @xmath19 is the _ reference _ probability distribution of trajectories when there are no gradients , i.e. at thermodynamic equilibrium . from fig .",
    "[ figureaa ] , it is clear that there are multiple choices of @xmath19 , for example , it may correspond to the equilibrium distribution at @xmath20 and @xmath21 or to the distribution at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "as an aside , the conditions for equilibrium ( see below ) are that ( a ) there are no net fluxes at equilibrium i.e. @xmath24 and similarly for @xmath25 and ( b ) the equilibrium state satisfies microscopic reversibility : the trajectory ensemble averages at equilibrium are unchanged under path reversal . under the situation where the flux is odd under time - reversal the condition ( b ) yields ( a ) .",
    "the caliber @xcite is maximized with the constraints on the macroscopic fluxes of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at time @xmath13 for all @xmath13 , which are enforced by the set of lagrange multipliers @xmath26 and @xmath27 :    @xmath28    maximizing the caliber with respect to the trajectory probability @xmath16 gives @xmath29 \\right)\\label{eq : pgamma}\\ ] ] with the dynamical partition function @xmath30 @xmath31 \\right ) .",

    "for example , average flux quantities are first derivatives of the logarithm of the _ dynamical partition function _ : @xmath32 identical equations follow for @xmath17 .",
    "eq .   allow the calculation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the knowledge of the functional form of @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] as well as the constrained values .",
    "higher moments of the dynamical distribution function can be calculated by taking higher derivatives of @xmath37 .",
    "for example , the second order cumulants are @xmath38 identical expressions follow for @xmath6 .",
    "so far , this development is general , allowing for time - dependent fluxes .",
    "however , for our purpose below of touching base with three well - known results of nesm , we now restrict consideration to stationary flows , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for all times @xmath13 .",
    "appendix 1 shows that it follows that the corresponding lagrange multipliers @xmath41 , @xmath42 are also independent of time .",
    "now , we show how the green - kubo relations , onsager s reciprocal relations , and prigogine s minimum entropy production theorem , are derived quite simply from equations   and  .",
    "the green - kubo relations are well - known expressions that give the relationships between various transport coefficients , on the one hand , and time correlation functions at equilibrium , on the other . here",
    ", we show that they can be derived quite directly from max cal .",
    "consider a coupled flow system in the linear regime and at stationary state when the driving forces are small .",
    "the macroscopic dynamics is time invariant ( i.e. steady state ) .",
    "concentrating on the fluxes at some time , call it @xmath43 .",
    "now , expand around small driving forces @xmath44 .",

    "when two types of flows are linearly proportional to the two corresponding forces ( i.e. , in nea - requilibrium situations , then we have @xmath54 for this situation , onsager derived the reciprocal relationship that @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this result can be derived straightforwardly from maximum caliber . from eq .  , and above , we have    @xmath56    the last equality follows from microscopic reversibility of the equilibrium state .",

    "our development shows that @xmath58 order expansion of the flux in terms of the thermodynamic gradients will involve @xmath59 order cumulants functions among fluxes at equilibrium .",
    "these cumulants do have some symmetry properties owing to microscopic reversibility and translational invariance with respect to time .",

    "the principle of max cal is a putative variational principle for nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "we show here that max cal provides a natural and simple route to deriving several key results of nesm , including the green - kubo relations , onsager reciprocal relations and prigogine s minimum entropy production principle .",
    "it s principal advantages over other derivations are that it is not limited to near equilibrium , or to ` local equilibrium assumptions ' , has a natural ` order parameter ' for defining a distance from equilibrium , and has a sounder basis in principle than quantities like entropy production rates . in short ,",

    "here , we explore the question of whether there are higher - order reciprocal relations distant from equilibrium that resemble onsager s reciprocal relations for near equilibrium . we start with the coefficients of the second order terms . for @xmath60",

    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 flows have opposite parity under time reversal we obtain by microscopic reversibility and time translation @xmath96 summing over @xmath47 gives the first order transport coefficients implying they all vanish @xmath97 , so there can be no off diagonal coupling coefficient between flows of opposite parity",

    "the general form of equation   is written as @xmath102 and the time translation of the right hand side gives @xmath103 again with the time ordering @xmath90 gives the following more general result from microscopic reversibility @xmath104    when @xmath105 the three equations above combine to show that for each term like @xmath106 , which is a term in the moment expansion of the coefficient for the @xmath107 term in the second order expansion of @xmath60 , there is an equal term in the moment expansion of the @xmath108 coefficient for flux @xmath61 , @xmath109 with @xmath86 . in the expansion of @xmath60 part of the @xmath107 coefficient are @xmath110 with @xmath90 . these terms equal @xmath111 and belong to the same sum for the @xmath107 coefficient .",
