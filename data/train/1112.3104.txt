    "from an analysis of the iras point source catalogue data , several post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) candidates were detected @xcite . these stars",
    "have far - infrared ( iras ) colours similar to proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) @xcite .",
    "several of them are at high galactic latitude , like hd 161796 ( f3ib ) @xcite and ls ii + 34 26 ( b1iae ) @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength studies of these objects by several investigators have confirmed that these are indeed in post - agb stage of evolution @xcite .",
    "the post - agb stars seem to form an evolutionary sequence ( k , g , f , a to ob supergiant types ) in the transition region from the tip of the agb to the early stages of planetary nebulae @xcite . in order to understand the evolution from cooler to hotter post - agb types and then into the young pn stage ,",
    "it is important to detect and study several hot post - agb candidates . @xcite and @xcite presented the results of low resolution blue spectra of 40 iras sources with far - ir colours similar to pne and ppne @xcite .",
    "a few of these objects have shown rapid changes in mk spectral type @xcite .",
    "the importance of the detection of new hot post - agb candidates relies in objects such as sao 244567 ( hen 3 - 1357 ) and ls ii + 34 26 .",
    "sao 244567 evolved rapidly from a b - type post - agb star into a young pn within a period of 20 years @xcite .",
    "the variations in the spectrum of sao 244567 were dramatic .",
    "another star ls ii + 34 26 initially classified as a massive b supergiant @xcite turned out to be a rapidly evolving b - type post - agb star @xcite .",
    "other such object are lse 162 ( sao 85766 ) @xcite ( references therein ) and lsiv -12 111 @xcite .",
    "another reason to detect more hot post - agb candidates is their abundance peculiarities @xcite which are different when compared with the chemical composition of cooler post - agb stars @xcite . very few hot post - agb stars are known and most of them are at high galactic latitudes and several of them are not iras sources @xcite .",
    "we started a program to identify new hot post - agb candidates by obtaining spectra of selected stars from ls , lss and lse catalogues @xcite , in the hope that some of them would reveal their post - agb nature by variations in the spectrum . and , if we have a siginificant sample of hot post - agb candidates subsequent chemical composition study of these candidates may enable us to understand their abundance peculiarities . ls , lss and lse catalogues are best sources for selecting high latitude luminous hot stars .",
    "in this paper we present new spectral types for 44 of these stars based on observations made with the 1 m telescope of the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , chile .",
    "included are several iras point sources which were not included in the first paper @xcite .",
    "the observing list consisted of stars selected from the ls , lss , and lse catalogues ( table 1 ) .",
    "the stars selected are either iras point sources and or o , b and a supergiants at high galactic latitudes , according to mk types given in the literature .",
    "the sample is biased towards stars which show some post - agb characteristic , i.e. positional coincidence with an iras point source with far - ir colours similar to post - agb stars and pne @xcite , high galactic latitude or known spectral peculiarity , luminous o , b , and a spectral types , and emission lines in the spectrum .",
    "our sample includes 29 stars , which are not iras sources so that we may be able to detect , post - agb stars without dust shells , similar to bd+ 39 4926 @xcite .",
    "we selected 38 stars from the lss catalogue , 4 stars from lse catalogue and two stars from ls catalogue . in the total selected sample of 44 stars only 15 stars",
    "are iras sources ( table 2 , figure 1 ) .",
    "digital spectra of 44 selected ( table 1 ) southern candidates were obtained during 19th to 27th april 1994 using the spectrograph and 2d - frutti two - dimensional photon counting detector on the 1 m telescope of the cerro tololo inter - american observatory in chile .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 10 minutes to 30 minutes .",
    "because of limited observing time at our disposal we have observed the selected stars only once .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 3800  to 5000 , and judging from the comparison spectra , the resolution is about 3.5  .",
    "the data were extracted , wavelength calibrated , and normalized to the continuum with the standard iraf software .",
    "spectra of all the 44 stars are shown in figure 2 .",
    "results of analysis of spectra of 40 iras sources obtained during the above mentioned observing dates were given in paper - i @xcite .",
    "we have compared the spectra of our program stars with the spectra of standard ob stars @xcite .",
    "walborn and fitzpatrick made a digital atlas of the spectra of ob stars which they observed with the same instrument , but at higher resolution than that described above .",
    "we found that smoothing the walborn and fitzpatrick spectra by 3.5   produced nearly identical looking spectra for the o9.5v star hd 37468 , which we observed , and the walborn and fitzpatrick o9.5v standard hd 93027 .",
    "the errors in the spectral atlas of walborn and fitzpatrick are of the order of 0.2 to 0.3 subtypes . among the o - stars they could classify o9.5 and o9.7 and among b stars they could classify b0.5 and b0.7 .",
    "spectral types for non ob stars were estimated by comparison with the photographic atlas of @xcite .",
    "the spectral types determined from the present investigation are given in table 1 .",
    "for non - ob stars we have also used the digital spectral atlases of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , however these atlases are of much lower resolution than our spectra .",
    "the errors in our spectal types that we gave in table 1 are of the order of 0.3 to 0.5 subtypes .",
    "for example we were able to distinguish spectral differences among b1 , b2 , and b3 stars .",
    "the letters e , f , p , and n by the side of spectral types in table 1 are of standrard mkk notation .",
    "letter `` e '' indicates emission line(s ) in the spectrum , `` f '' indicates o - type star with emission lines , ( f ) indicates n iii emission is present and the notation ( ( f ) ) signifies that in addition to strong he ii 4686   weak n iii @xmath0@xmath0 4634 - 4640 - 4642 emission is present @xcite , `` p '' indicates peculiar , and `` n '' indicates broad lines .",
