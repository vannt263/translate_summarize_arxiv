    "the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) , one of the four missions in nasa s  great observatories \" series , was launched in 1991 april and operated in low earth orbit until its controlled re - entry in 2000 june .",
    "cgro was responsible for many discoveries in the study of gamma - ray bursts , accreting binaries , active galaxies , and pulsars ( see general reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quest for the origin of gamma - ray bursts @xcite led to the development and flight of the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the cgro .",
    "in addition to batse s primary science goals , its nine years of nearly continuous operation and all - sky capability allowed monitoring of the low - energy gamma - ray sky using the earth occultation technique ( eot ) .",
    "several new objects were discovered in the batse dataset with the eot , and numerous outbursts of transient and periodic sources were detected during the mission .",
    "here we present a compilation of batse eot observations that can be used as the basis for more detailed studies on individual sources , for which it is important to have a knowledge of the long - lived emission in the batse energy range .",
    "it is our hope that these results will stimulate and guide future observations of the low - energy gamma - ray sky . in this work",
    ", we performed a careful assessment of systematic error in deriving results for the entire mission .",
    "the intent was to push the instrumental and technical limits of the present application of the batse earth occultation technique ( eot ) .",
    "these data are made available on - line to other investigators through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) at nasa goddard space flight center , the web site of the batse earth occultation team at the nasa marshall space flight center , and the compton observatory science support center ( cossc ) .    to make the presentation of this work tractable , we divided the catalog into two parts .",
    "first , we emphasized the all - sky monitoring capability of batse .",
    "for the bright sources that vary on timescales greater than a few hours , we give an overview of activity and representative flux and spectral behavior .",
    "we also briefly make note of the science investigations performed with the eot during the mission .",
    "second , we performed a  sky survey \" of a comprehensive set of low - energy gamma - ray sources .",
    "we note that this is not a true survey , in that it is biased by preselection of sources .",
    "the emphasis is on obtaining good quality results along the galactic plane where accreting sources dominate the low - energy gamma - ray sky .",
    "we note that other missions with all - sky or wide - field coverage were operational between 1991 and 2000 .",
    "a non - exhaustive list includes the japanese _ ginga _ satellite , with its all - sky monitor , functioning between 1987 february and 1991 october @xcite , and covering the bandpass of 1@xmath220 kev , the scanning and imaging instruments aboard the french - russian spacecraft _ granat _",
    "@xcite , which operated between 1989 december and 1997 october , and the u.s .",
    "_ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) mission , with its all - sky monitor ( 2 - 12 kev ) @xcite , which began operation in 1995 december and remains operational .",
    "_ granat_/sigma @xcite , a coded mask , sodium iodide imaging detector system , provided considerable coverage and detailed images of the central region of the galaxy in the 35@xmath21300 kev bandpass .",
    "there were also scanning instruments of common design on board _ granat _ and danish _ eureca _ spacecraft known as watch @xcite that monitored a portion of the x - ray sky in the 5 - 120 kev band .",
    "the powerful wide field cameras @xcite on the italian - dutch _ bepposax _ satellite ( 1.8 - 28 kev ) provided coded aperture imaging for both surveying and monitoring of large areas of the sky .",
    "batse complemented these instruments by full - sky monitoring of the energy range from 20 kev up to about 1 mev .",
    "much potential remains for investigations using combinations of these datasets .",
    "batse served as an all - sky monitor using the earth occultation technique @xcite between 1991 april 23 and 2000 may 28 ( @xmath09.1y ) .",
    "this capability was used to trigger numerous pointed observations with the cgro and other observatories .",
    "we extracted earth occultation measurements from the batse dataset at a maximum rate of twice per 92 m orbit of cgro in sixteen energy channels between 20 kev and 1 mev .",
    "intensity data for any part of the sky , subject to the geometric constraints of occultation , were available for the duration of the mission with the exception of a few brief intervals ( see appendix b ) .",
    "although the batse eot was limited in sensitivity by high backgrounds and modest spatial resolution ( @xmath01@xmath3 ) , we could investigate intensity and spectral variations over a dynamical range from days to years .",
    "although @xmath0daily timescales have been accessible with pointed instruments , batse was the first all - sky monitor since those of _",
    "vela 5b _ @xcite and _ ariel 5 _ @xcite , to cover the upper end of this time range .    on the other hand , no low - energy gamma - ray full - sky surveys have been performed since the pioneering heao 1 a-4 experiment in 1977 - 79 @xcite .",
    "that experiment covered the energy range between 13 and 180 kev , and resulted in the detection of about 70 sources ( 7 of them extragalactic ) .",
    "such a survey with batse has been attempted by our group in the past @xcite using the earth occultation imaging technique @xcite .",
    "this did not prove to be an efficient way to survey the sky due to the limitations on computer time combined with residual features and the small size ( a few degrees ) of the images . a new effort , incorporating more sophisticated background modeling techniques developed for the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory_(integral)@xcite and detector point spread functions for limb geometry , holds much promise for achieving this goal @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 we compare the sensitivity of the batse deep sample ( this work ) with that of the heao 1 survey and a proposed future low - energy gamma - ray sky survey mission the _ energetic x - ray imaging survey telescope _ ( exist ) @xcite .",
    "the binning of the batse sensitivity curve reflects the maximum energy resolution obtainable with the eot .",
    "in addition to the list of monitored sources accumulated during the operation of batse , we reviewed the heao 1 a-4 hard x - ray @xcite catalog and the recent gamma - ray source compilation of @xcite for completeness of the known high energy galactic sources , and performed a literature search of other high - energy objects above the batse sensitivity threshold .",
    "we did not include the egret ",
    "unidentified \" sources from @xcite due to the probable extragalactic nature of many of them , and the relatively large uncertainty in location ( @xmath01@xmath3 ) that would strongly affect the measured flux using the eot .",
    "the sources addressed in this catalog are shown on a sky map in galactic coordinates in fig .",
    "we have included 179 sources in our deep sample of the sky .",
    "the majority of sources are accreting binaries ; however , we include the brighter sources from the other object classes for comparison .",
    "of the 179 sources , most ( 76% ) are accretors , i.e. , black hole or non - pulsed neutron star binaries ( 97 ) , or binaries containing pulsars ( 41 ) .",
    "again we stress that our deep sampling of the known gamma - ray sources should not be considered as a true background - limited survey to a given brightness threshold .",
    "however , by virtue of our comparisons to heao 1 a-4 survey data , we believe that we have a reasonably complete sampling of high energy accreting systems in the milky way galaxy down to an average flux level of @xmath030 mcrab ( 20 - 100 kev )",
    ".    we also note that to date , samples of objects have been performed with batse for active galaxies @xcite , supernova remnants @xcite , globular clusters @xcite , x - ray stars @xcite , and prompt emission from nearby novae @xcite .",
    "the most promising classes of sources , other than accreting binaries , for which batse has shown positive detections , are active galaxies , such as seyferts and blazars , and supernova remnants . as part of our 179-source sample , we included selected supernova remnants ( 17 ) ( some of which contain pulsars or soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) ) , active galaxies ( 12 ) , and x - ray emitting stars ( 12 ) , that overlap these other studies .    in sec .",
    "2 , we give a brief overview of batse and the use of the earth occultation technique .",
    "we then discuss production details for the catalog . in sec .",
    "3 we present highlights of the all - sky monitoring effort , and give an overview of science obtained for the different classes of detected sources . sec .",
    "4 presents the deep sample results and how they are organized .",
    "we describe a sky - dependent systematic error model and apply it to the measured source fluxes .",
    "we then examine the consistency of source detections by focusing on some of the weak sources in the few mcrab intensity range .",
    "this is done by testing with methods that are independent of the occultation step fitting routines . finally , in sec . 5",
    ", we briefly discuss applications of the catalog data .",
    "the earth occultation analysis technique utilizes the large area detectors ( lads ) on batse , which are sensitive to photons above 20 kev .",
    "compton gamma ray observatory _ including placement of the batse detector modules on the spacecraft is illustrated pictorially in fig .",
    "the lads are composed of sodium iodide ( nai(tl ) ) crystals , 1.27 cm ( 0.5 in ) thick by 50.8 cm ( 20 in ) across ( 2025 @xmath4 total area of one detector ) .",
    "eight modules are mounted on the corners of the cgro with normal vectors perpendicular to the faces of a regular octahedron .",
    "any point on the sky can viewed by four detectors at angles less than 90@xmath3 to the source direction . for the eot , the measurement sensitivity of the lads is maintained by combining statistics from two , three and ultimately four detectors at successively larger angles from any one of the detector normals .",
    "a full description of the batse detectors and the experiment can be found , for example , in @xcite . in a companion paper to this catalog (",
    "* see also references therein ) , we discussed the use of the eot in various forms , and described in detail a number of aspects of the technique such as source identification , sensitivity , and systematic error .",
    "the earth occultation technique was also developed and applied to batse data in a separate , parallel effort at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) @xcite .",
    "we discuss our results in comparison to this work in appendix c. in one orbit around the earth , two occultation step features , a rise and set pair , will be superimposed on the background counting rate as each point source is occulted .",
    "a measurement can be made of the intensity of a source in each energy channel at rise or set . in practice ,",
    "two measurements per orbit were not always achieved .",
    "the most common reasons were passages through the lower van allen radiation belt at the south atlantic anomaly when the detector high voltage was off , or that cgro was out of line - of - sight contact with the nasa tracking & data relay satellites , or data were flagged and not available for analysis .",
    "in addition , high declination sources ( @xmath541@xmath3 ) experience an interruption of occultations near the orbital poles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and source confusion , where occultations of one source are indistinguishable from another , limits the number of usable occultation steps .",
    "the combined impact of these effects caused earth occultation coverage averaged over one precession cycle ( @xmath052d ) to range between 80%-90% , at best , and at worst , about 50% .",
    "the count rate for a source in the lad was extracted by simultaneously fitting occultation step features with terms for each source in the fit and a quadratic polynomial to represent the detector background .",
    "the fit was performed independently for each lad and in each energy channel .",
    "occultation steps ( lasting @xmath010s ) are relatively sharp features superimposed on the slower background variations caused by orbital motion around the earth .",
    "we assumed that the background was smooth and adequately fit by a second order polynomial .",
    "occasional failures of this assumption were usually caused by the presence in the data of bright pulsars , weak bursts , solar flares , and other disturbances on the timescale of the fitting window .",
    "generally , in the absence of unusual background fluctuations , we have found that the lads were consistently reproducible in the measured fluxes based on tests using the crab nebula fluxes in a given detector , angle and energy bin . the only exception to this was the late mission ( approx .",
    "last two years ) loss of gain stabilization in lad 7 .",
    "we took this considerably further , however , to reduce measurement inconsistencies between lads that might be intermittent ( unusual background fluctuations ) , and lad - response related ( time - independent effects ) .",
    "we did this by ( 1 ) performing a flagging procedure for outliers at the single step level ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* sec 2.2 , page 152 ) , and also outlined in sec 2.3 of this manuscript ) , and ( 2 ) developing an empirical correction to the detector response based on the crab data in channels 1 - 10 in all eight lads at angles between 0 and 90 degrees ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* sec 3.5 , pages 167 - 170 ) .",
    "all light curves and spectra in the catalog were subjected to these two procedures except for a few sources as noted in sec .",
    "any remaining non - poissonian components in the data must then be accounted for in estimating systematic errors , which we have done on an average basis using a grid - interpolation procedure as discussed in sec 4.2 .",
    "more details of the properties of earth occultation features and how the eot was used can be found in @xcite .",
    "a raw count rate history for each point source was accumulated from fitting occultation steps on successive days ( usually about 15 - 30 steps per day ) .",
    "the instrument response was deconvolved in a following step to produce intensities in units of photon number , energy flux , or units relative to a reference source , such as the crab nebula .",
    "the process of generation and analysis of the occultation count rate histories is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the raw light curves , uncorrected for detector response , were generated with a software package known as of_w .",
    "the code carries or collects all information on source location , spacecraft orientation and trajectory , detector gains , and a limited amount of data on relative source intensity , required to extract source count rates from occultation step features in the batse cont ( 2.048s , 20 - 1000 kev in 16 energy channels ) data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more complete description of datatypes ) .",
    "in table 1 , we show the standard input parameters for of_w . the definitions of these parameters are : ( 1 ) 2@xmath6 , length of the background data sample in seconds .",
    "the data that define the _ fitting window _ were selected to be symmetric about the occultation step of the source of interest ( soi ) . from an analysis of relative size of systematic error to the statistical error using the second - degree polynomial for the background @xcite , a value for @xmath6 of @xmath0110s",
    "was found to be optimal .",
    "we also allowed an additional non - adjustable time of 20s for the width of the occultation step itself .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath7@xmath8 is the maximum detector aspect angle of a source ( i.e. , the angle between the detector normal vector and the vector toward the source ) allowed for source measurement .",
    "since there was no improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio by combining data from detectors beyond about 60@xmath3 , this was a convenient cutoff for choosing which detectors were used .",
    "this value produced a combination of one to four lads depending on cgro orientation .",
    "the only exceptions to this were cases where a small range of azimuthal viewing angles were occasionally blocked by the cgro high gain antenna .",
    "when this occurred we excluded these lads from the measurement .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath7@xmath9 is the maximum detector aspect angle for a source , with an occultation step time in the fitting window of the soi , that must be simultaneously fit with the soi ( * ? ? ? * see for fitting model details ) . a value of 70@xmath3 was selected because bright sources such as the crab or cygnus x-1 still have substantial flux even at very large aspect angles .",
    "( 4 ) @xmath10 is the minimum time separation between occultations of two sources in the fitting window that were allowed separate terms in the fit . if the times of the soi and an interfering source fell within the fitting window and satisfied the aspect angle criteria , but were within @xmath10=10s , then the fit was rejected by of_w . ( 5 ) @xmath11 is the minimum fraction of data packets accepted for an occultation step fit .",
    "the acceptance criterion helped to minimize potentially singular matrices and other instabilities in the fitting routines .",
    "for this work , @xmath11 was set at 95% . finally , ( 6 ) @xmath12@xmath13 is the threshold photon flux , which if exceeded , caused of_w to add a fitting term for an occultation step of a source within the fitting window of the soi , provided criterion ( 4 ) was not invoked .",
    "a database was kept of sources that were found from previous passes through the batse dataset to exceed @xmath12@xmath13 for intervals of more than a few minutes , and typically a day or longer .",
    "the value of @xmath12@xmath13 , 0.01 photons @xmath14s@xmath15 , refers to the energy band of 20 - 100 kev , which we took as our standard band for this work .",
    "in addition to a list of sources for measurement , of_w requires the following databases as also noted in fig .",
    "4 .      to optimize the sensitivity of the eot , we tried to minimize the number of source terms ( soi + potentially interfering sources ) in the fitting window .",
    "a database of source outburst times , and intensity bands provides information to determine whether terms for other sources should be included in the fit .",
    "this database was built up as new sources were found either through occultation analysis ( light curves and images ) or observations with other instruments .",
    "information about source outburst intensity levels as a function of time was read from the database by of_w before the flux measurement was performed .",
    "for a first complete pass through the batse dataset ( which we refer to as the  first iteration \" ) , @xmath12@xmath13 was set at 0.02 photons @xmath14s@xmath15 ( 20 - 100 kev , @xmath075 mcrab ) .",
    "sources dimmer than this threshold , however , were found to introduce significant interference in our measurements . for this work ( the second iteration ) , we lowered @xmath12@xmath13 to 0.01 photons @xmath14s@xmath15 ( 20 - 100 kev , @xmath035 mcrab ) . in table 2",
    ", we show the sources that consistently exceeded @xmath12@xmath13 ( identified as  persistent sources \" ) , along with their average flux , and for table 3 , we show those that exceeded @xmath12@xmath13 for an identifiable , but limited period of time . although a wide variety of source behavior was observed with batse ( see also the assessment of the rxte asm data by @xcite ) , table 3 sources were broadly classified as  transient sources \" ,",
    "although duty fractions could range from @xmath161% up to 90% . if the beginning and ending times of the fitting window fell within the outburst interval of a potentially interfering transient source , and it met the usual geometric criteria , a fitting term was included .",
    "for this particular iteration of the catalog , we have added a number of low - level outbursts for the transient sources in table 3 not previously reported in other publications .",
    "some special notes regarding the detection and monitoring of transients are given in appendix a.    a few bright x - ray binaries containing neutron stars , her x-1 , 4u 1700 - 377 , vela x-1 , cen x-3 , and oao 1657 - 415 , undergo complete eclipses by their companion stars and have well - documented ephemerides ( see fig . 5 )",
    "we took advantage of this in the fitting process by eliminating interfering source terms for these sources during eclipse .",
    "comparison of the eclipse times to the fitting window times were made in the solar system barycentric frame @xcite .",
    "cgro was 3-axis stabilized , and maintained the same orientation for extended periods , typically 2-week intervals .",
    "the cgro orientation was defined by the right ascension and declination of x and z - axes of the spacecraft in j2000 coordinates , and was used to determine the optimum detectors for the occultation measurement of the soi and potentially interfering sources .",
    "the sixteen channel cont data had programmable energy bins .",
    "these were usually kept to a standard set of values ( see appendix b ) , except for occasional changes that were made to allow higher resolution measurements of sources with strong spectral cutoffs such as pulsars and sgrs .",
    "energy calibration of the bin boundaries or  edges \" are required to obtain photon fluxes .",
    "they are also used to compute small electronic deadtime corrections in of_w , which depend on the total observed counting rate ( source + background ) .      before deconvolution of the detector response",
    ", we flagged ( i.e. , excluded ) any remaining large outliers from the single step raw light curve files .",
    "the two reasons for doing this were to place a tighter limit on obviously unphysical fitting results , and to exclude data contaminated by background fluctuations that flagging by daily visual inspection failed to remove @xcite .",
    "both of these situations were relatively rare ; however , they could produce spurious daily flux averages .",
    "we settled on a scheme that could be implemented without special treatment of individual sources , and was based on a filter for variations from an average flux level . in this scheme , we averaged the count rate from a source for each cgro observing period , and subtracted the average from the rates ( channels 1 - 10 ) over the same period .",
    "we then made a cut on the rates at @xmath173.5@xmath1 to remove outliers .",
    "this approach worked well for all sources except those that showed strong variations of 0.5 - 1 crab on timescales of minutes to a few hours .",
    "the persistent sources that fell into this category were cyg x-1 , sco x-1 , 4u 1700 - 377 , and vela x-1 . a few of the brighter",
    ", highly variable transient sources also exceeded this variability criterion during outburst . typically , the percentage of rates rejected in this way was less than 5% for the majority of sources , and did not significantly affect the measured fluxes and uncertainties .",
    "however cyg x-1 could , at times , have rejection rates as high as 13% .",
    "we therefore converted count rate data to photon fluxes for these four persistent sources without this flagging procedure .",
    "for the bright transient sources , we visually inspected the raw light curves during the times listed in table 3 , and removed flags on apparently good data that were set by the automated flagging procedure .",
    "two methods were developed to obtain flux and spectral information from the batse occultation count rate data .",
    "the first method is a fitting procedure used commonly in high energy astronomy called  forward - folding \" @xcite , where we assumed a spectral model that was a reasonable representation of a source flux in the lad energy range .",
    "then the selected model was folded through the instrument response @xcite for the illuminated detectors to determine model count spectra .",
    "the count data were fit , by varying the model parameters , in a chi - square minimization procedure .",
    "finally the best fitting model was integrated over the desired energy range to determine the photon flux .",
    "this method avoids a potentially unstable inversion of the batse response matrices , which have large off - diagonal elements due to the lad s relatively shallow detection depth and lack of compton suppression .",
    "it lends itself well to generation of multi - channel spectra , obtaining photon fluxes in a desired energy range , and performing broad - band spectral analyses . for the spectral analysis results in tables 2 and 3",
    ", we used a widely available code known as xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) , and for the flux history generation , a code developed locally for specific use with earth occultation data known as hisgen ( see fig .",
    "both codes use forward - folding to estimate photon fluxes .",
    "the second method uses the crab ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see for an example spectrum ) as a standard candle by obtaining a ratio of the count rate for a given source relative to that of the crab in the same detector orientation and energy channel .",
    "this is convenient for computing hardness ratios , epoch folding and investigating the deep sample results discussed later .",
    "the resulting fluxes were less model dependent than those using the forward - folding method .",
    "four energy bands in crab - relative units were selected to report the results of the deep sample in sec .",
    "4 : 20 - 40 , 40 - 70 , 70 - 160 , and 160 - 430 kev .",
    "the energy binning is somewhat constrained by the cont data channel binning scheme ( see appendix b , table b1 ) . and , although the lads have some sensitivity to fluxes in excess of 430 kev , we chose not to include a higher energy band due to statistics ( a relative lack of positive detections at higher energy ) , and the self - consistent treatment of systematic error which was based on a study only in the 20 - 100 kev range .",
    "conversion factors from the reported four - band crab relative intensities to photon and energy fluxes can be found in appendix b , table b2 .",
    "high voltage was first applied to the large area detectors on truncated julian date ( tjd ) 8362 , or 16 april 1991 .",
    "final shutdown occurred on tjd 11691 , or 26 may 2000 .",
    "data were available between tjd 8362 and 11690 , except for a few brief periods due to orbital reboosts and occasional mission anomalies as listed in appendix b. light curves and representative spectra for the sources considered persistent or transient by of_w ( a total of 58 objects ) can be found on the web at + http://gammaray.msfc.nasa.gov/batse/occultation + in visual as well as tabular form .",

    "4 ) . likewise ,",
    "transient ( t ) sources in the batse flare database appear in table 3 .",
    "the tables carry information about source type , characteristic spectral data , outburst times , and energy flux for these sources in the 20@xmath2100 kev band .    of the four general classes of sources represented in this catalog ( x - ray binaries , supernova remnants / pulsars / sgrs , agns and x - ray stars ) ,",
    "three are represented in tables 2 and 3 .",

    "emission in the low - energy gamma - ray range is understood to be primarily upscattered low - energy photons by the inverse compton process .",
    "batse studies have illustrated both spectral and intensity variations associated with state transitions ( e.g , high ( soft ) , low ( hard ) and off states ) of black hole binaries .",
    "such state transitions are thought to be driven by changes in the mass accretion rate .",
    "a prime example of this phenomenon is the 1996 hard - soft - hard state transition in cyg x-1 , which was monitored in both x - rays ( 2 - 12 kev ) with rxte / asm and low - energy gamma - rays with batse @xcite .",

    "the overall brightness of the secondary outbursts tends toward lesser intensity over time ( grs 1915 + 105 being an exception ) .",
    "sometimes there is an apparent return to x - ray quiescence between outbursts , e.g. , gro j1655 - 4 @xcite .",

    "the standard deviations were clearly broader than predicted for a gaussian distribution about zero flux due to systematic errors ( 1 @xmath1 = @xmath00.01 photons @xmath14s@xmath15 ) .",
    "we found broadening factors of about 20% ( between 70@xmath3 and 180@xmath3 longitude and peaking near a factor of 2 at about -105@xmath3 ) in excess of normal statistics .",

    "for any point sources less than @xmath1760@xmath3 longitude , and latitudes between 6@xmath3 and 10@xmath3 and between -6@xmath3 and -10@xmath3 , we also applied a two - point interpolation .",

    "we also show the assigned category , as determined after the corrections were applied .",
    "we note that transients , and especially those with low duty fractions , may have an average flux that is much less than the peak flux , and can appear anywhere on the curve .",
    "of the 179 sources , about 110 - 120 sources were above the 3@xmath1 flux limit .",
    "this agrees well with the combined number of sources ( 119 ) in categories a through c. note that category n sources with a slightly negative , non - significant flux , and all of the category i sources , whose fluxes are @xmath16 -3@xmath1 negative , are not visible in the log plot .",
    "the main effect of the systematic corrections is to smooth the trend of the lower part of the intensity curve , which shows a rollover at the low flux end .",
    "the physical interpretation of the rollover is that we are no longer able to distinguish significantly measurable flux due to systematic and statistical effects at low source intensity .",
    "we are also prone to missing sources in our biased sample such as transients or persistent sources with fluxes comparable to those in category c.    there is a possibility that the rollover of the intensity curve reflects the true galactic distribution of sources .",
    "the depth of our sample in flux is significantly beyond the @xmath070 sources detected in the heao 1 a-4 survey @xcite , even with batse s higher energy threshold .",
    "for example , hmxbs and lmxbs are thought , respectively , to be formed in binaries with population i and ii progenitor stars , and thus have sharply differing galactic distributions @xcite .",
    "however , to extrapolate information about source populations in our data is difficult due to the missing sources and the relatively small size of the sample .",
    "a deep , unbiased survey with an instrument such as exist , with excellent background rejection and spatial resolution characteristics , could produce a much more precisely determined extension and shape for the curve shown in fig",
    ". 13 .      before concluding this work , it is interesting to look at the robustness and consistency of the reported detections in table 4 without going into great detail . to do this , we examined sources at flux levels close to the sensitivity limit of the eot , i.e. , just above the level where systematic effects dominate .",
    "we saw from the grid analysis that there were positive as well as negative flux offsets at the measured control locations , as well as a few significant outliers .",
    "ideally , interpolation of the offsets should allow us to estimate systematic errors in the point source set .",
    "however , we have noted some shortcomings of the approach : there are category i sources remaining after the model was applied .",
    "another imperfection is that there are cases where a reasonably bright source is omitted from our model ( tables 2 and 3 ) , and we may erroneously subtract  real \" flux from the statistically - derived average .    from the analysis of the grid outliers and in the results of table 4 , we found that the hmxb psr 4u 1907 + 097 @xcite , and the lmxbs cir x-1 @xcite and h 1624 - 490 @xcite have a raw significance in the 20 - 100 kev band sufficient to be considered as category b , but in failing to identify these sources as bright sources , they fall into categories c , c , and n , respectively , after an overestimated correction .",
    "we also found reasonable agreement between our uncorrected fluxes ( i.e. , before systematic error corrections were made ) and the observed low - energy gamma - ray fluxes from the literature for these sources .",
    "the burster 1e 1724 - 307 of the terzan 2 globular cluster is another example ; 1e 1724 - 307 was the only category a source found in the deep sample .",

    "* see also fig .",
    "8) in the 20 - 100 kev band , and was not considered a bright source in the current pass through the data .",
    "we did not alter the systematic corrections to the flux for the four sources in the catalog , but it is likely , pending other tests , that these sources should be included in the bright source model for a future pass through the dataset .",
    "next we rigorously examined the category b subset of sources , a total of 29 objects , which we claimed are definite detections .",
    "these sources are gathered for inspection in table 5 .",
    "the ( model - dependent ) average fluxes ( 9.1y ) in the 20 - 100 kev band are between 1.2 and 9.6@xmath3710@xmath38 photons @xmath14s@xmath15 , with detection significances , including systematic error , varying between 10 and 52@xmath1 . unlike table 4 , we list both the uncorrected average flux and error , and the interpolated systematic correction based on the source location with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "eighteen of the 29 sources were within 10@xmath3 of the galactic plane and thus had corrections to the given flux average and error .",
    "correction factors to the average flux for the category b sources ranged as high as 150% in the gcr . as indicated in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , if f@xmath33 @xmath39 0 , it was subtracted from the statistical average .",
    "if f@xmath33 @xmath16 0 , it was added to the statistical average .",
    "as can be seen in column 4 of table 4 , the net effect of the systematic error corrections for the deep sample was to render a number of category b and c sources as a lower category , and some of the category i sources as category n. of the 29 sources in category b , 27 did not require recategorization after systematic corrections were applied .    on the other hand , there were a few cases where addition of a large correction factor to the average flux of a category c or n ( non - detection ) source resulted in a total corrected flux level and significance equivalent to a category b source .",
    "two of these appear in table 5 : 4u 1820 - 303 , a category b(c ) source , and 4u 1916 - 053 , a category b(n ) source .",
    "a previous survey for hard x - ray emission in the batse database @xcite reported 2@xmath1 upper limits of 30 mcrab for both 4u 1820 - 303 and 4u 1916 - 053 in the 20 - 100 kev band using 10 days of data .",
    "since that time , @xcite followed up the batse results with observations of both 4u 1820 - 303 and 4u 1916 - 053 with rxte , as did @xcite using _",
    "bepposax_. hard tails were observed in both sources . in our deep sample ,",
    "we report a 20 - 40 kev flux over 9.1y in table 5 from 4u 1820 - 303 of 11@xmath170.8 mcrab ( uncorrected ) in the 20 - 40 kev band , and a corrected flux of 23@xmath171.1 mcrab .",
    "the corrected flux is a reasonable factor of 4 - 5 lower than a recent rxte measurement of the hard x - ray flux by @xcite .",
    "4u 1916 - 053 showed no significant detection ( 0.9@xmath170.7 mcrab ) ( uncorrected ) in the 20 - 40 kev band , but a corrected flux of 38@xmath171.0 mcrab , reasonably close to the rxte and _ bepposax _ results , but about a factor of 2 higher .",
    "since it is unlikely that the source spends most of the time at flux levels more than that observed in the pointed observations , this suggests that the magnitude of the systematic correction for 4u 1916 - 053 is over - estimated .",
    "the sign of @xmath40 , i.e. , the sense of the correction , though , to render a significant positive measurement , is correct .",
    "of course , without specific knowledge of variability of the hard tails in these objects , it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion , but it is possible that rather large systematic error corrections could be suspect in our model .",
    "this is not too surprising , since we are under sampling a rather complex and rapidly changing residual flux as a function of sky location as shown in the top frame of fig 12 .",
    "we are also correcting the 4-band fluxes , which span the energy range between 20 and 430 kev , with a correction deduced for the 20 - 100 kev band .    to investigate the impact of the correction factors more generally , we computed the relative change in significance for all sources in our sample before and after the correction was applied .",
    "this is shown as a histogram in fig .",
    "the distribution is dominated by the simple multiplicative correction of the second moment ( centered at -0.3 ) , but in cases where the uncorrected , statistically - derived flux was very small relative to the systematic correction to the flux , @xmath40/@xmath24 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) was consequently very large .",
    "these are represented by the outlying wings of the histogram .",
    "we therefore made symmetric cuts on the distribution of fractional changes in significance about the median value at -1.05 on the low end of the distribution and 0.45 on the high end in fig .",
    "24 of the 179 sources had a fractional change in significance that fell outside of the vertical dashed lines .",
    "we also found that the absolute value of the significance was increased by application of the systematic error correction for 16 of the 24 sources beyond the cuts , whereas for most sources , the significance was reduced .",
    "we therefore decided it was better to quote the uncorrected relative crab rates in the four bands for these 24 sources in table 4 , including the two category b sources discussed above .",
    "the 4-band fluxes with no systematic corrections to the statistically - derived fluxes are denoted by the four band rates in parenthesis .",
    "the judgment here is that the uncorrected 4-band fluxes for these objects are closer to the true 9.1y averages .    in the following sections we illustrate the robustness of the category b source detections using periodicity searches and earth occultation imaging .",
    "it is important to establish the reliability of the eot method at these low flux levels .",
    "for example , detection of the black hole candidate ls 5039 @xcite in the low - energy gamma - ray band has not been reported previously in the literature , and 4u 1812 - 12 , was reported only for the first time in @xcite .",
    "x - ray binaries sometimes exhibit periodic or quasi - periodic intensity changes , and in most cases , the observed periods correspond to the orbital period of the binary ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "super - orbital periods ( @xmath42 ) also have been observed in accreting neutron star systems , and have been attributed to disk precession @xcite , and/or periodic reversals of the spin direction @xcite . @xcite",
    "have investigated periodic behavior in hmxbs in the batse eot database .",
    "here we use the identification of a period or quasi - period in the category b sources to add confidence to the detection of the fluxes presented in table 5 .",
    "searches for periodic behavior in unevenly sampled data from the eot are accomplished using the lomb - scargle algorithm for fourier transforms @xcite , and epoch folding techniques in specific cases .",
    "we first performed fourier transforms to create power density spectra ( pds ) of the 9.1-year one - day average light curves to search for periods in the flux variations from all sources .",
    "the pds were scanned in the frequency range between 0.002 d@xmath15 ( 500 days , 6.6 cycles ) and 0.5d@xmath15 ( the nyquist frequency of evenly sampled data ) .",
    "a simple threshold for reporting of a peak was set at a significance , or false alarm probability ( fap ) @xcite , of 0.01 ( fap=1 is roughly the level of poisson noise ) for the lomb periodogram .",
    "the fap is related to the pds peak power _ z _ @xcite as @xmath43 or if the probability is @xmath441 , @xmath45 .",
    "_ m _ is the number of independent frequencies and is related to the total number of flux values _",
    "n _ as @xmath46 the oversampling factor @xmath47 was set at a value of 4 , and the maximum ( high end ) frequency @xmath48 for the pds was set at 2 , so that _ m_=4_n_. it should be noted that the fap is strictly a meaningful quantity for a pds of gaussian distributed data that is normalized by the variance of the dataset . as we have shown earlier for eot light curves ,",
    "the second assumption is clearly violated .",
    "thus the faps should only be taken as an indication of relative significance .    in table 6",
    "we list the search results from the pds analysis of the category a and b sources .",
    "we limited ourselves to peaks in the pds that corresponded to orbital and super - orbital periods found in the literature .",
    "the far column indicates the fap computed for the power at the peak frequency .",
    "it can be seen that the fap ranges from relative large values @xmath00.01 ( closer to the poisson noise level but very significant ) to very small values for persistent , eclipsing category a sources such as cen x-3 , vela x-1 , oao 1657 - 415 , and 4u 1700 - 377 ( see also fig .",
    "5 ) , as well as some of the sources with superperiods such as lmc x-4 and her x-1 .",
    "the reported uncertainty in the centroid frequency is an approximate error based on the oversampling factor and not a formally derived error .",
    "the quoted error can be reduced by proper fitting of the pds and subtraction of the sinusoidal signal from the light curve , and the variance recomputed @xcite .",
    "since we are interested only in confirming detections of the category b sources , this analysis was not performed .    the only category b sources with detected periods using ffts were smc x-1 , lmc x-4 , and 4u 1538 - 522 .",
    "all are eclipsing hmxbs .",
    "both smc x-1 @xcite and lmc x-4 @xcite were previously known to show orbital and superorbital - related variations in the batse data .",
    "4u 1538 - 522 was already detected by batse via its pulsed emission @xcite , but this is the first reported eot detection of its orbital period of 3.728d .",
    "the fft analysis was performed only on the 1-day resolution light curves with a simple cutoff for the fap and is complicated by low frequency noise , cgro orbital precession , and other effects .",
    "for example , @xcite reported a marginal result for the orbital period of the hmxb pulsar 4u 1907 + 097 ( 8.3745d ) , a category c(b ) source , that did not show up in the pds search . since only a few category b sources were detected in the pds , we carried out epoch folding of the single step ( twice per cgro orbit sampling ) light curves of at known periods for selected category b sources . in fig 15(a ) , we show 9.1y single step light curves of the three category b sources folded at the _",
    "@xmath41 _ given in column 2 of table 6 and the light curve of 4u 1907 + 097 folded at 8.3745d . in fig 15(b ) , we show single step folded light curves for sources with the reported super - orbital periods in column 3 of table 6 .",
    "4u 1538 - 522 , lmc x-4 , and smc x-1 all exhibit sharp eclipse profiles , as well as prominent super - orbital variations for the latter two sources .",
    "we also epoch - folded single step 4-band rates searching for reported periods from soft x - ray and optical measurements among several of the remaining category b sources ( some perhaps binary - orbit related ) in x per ( 250d , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and cyg x-2 ( 9.84 , 40.4 , 53.7 , 61.3 , and 68.8d , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among these 10 sources ,",
    "no convincing periodicities were seen in the epoch folded light curves . given that the average fluxes of the hmxb eclipsers 4u 1538 - 522 , lmc x-4 , and smc x-1 are comparable to the other category b sources in table 5 , it is somewhat surprising that other binaries , which have reported periods in x - rays , did not show recognizable periodic variations in the epoch folded light curves .",
    "we point out that several of the category b + lmxbs are high inclination , compact , ultra - short period binaries known as  dippers \" .",
    "these close binaries have orbital periods of only minutes to hours .",
    "the actual dips and/or eclipses are very short , @xmath0few minutes , and are observed as absorption - induced changes in the soft x - ray flux ( @xmath0kev ) @xcite .",
    "such short duration absorption dips are not accessible using the batse eot ; however , the reported superorbital periods are easily within the timescales accessible for epoch folding , yet none were seen .",
    "more work should be done with these sources , but the apparent lack of periodicity in the lmxbs ( 6 out of 6 ) is interesting . assuming the reported x - ray and optical modulations are predominantly associated with disk precession as in the hmxbs , such effects do not appear to modulate the intensity of the observed gamma - ray flux in our category b lmxbs .",
    "due to the limited success of the periodicity searches in the category b light curves , we employed earth occultation imaging to localize the gamma - ray flux from these sources . the occultation imaging technique @xcite allows the construction of a 2-d image of a region of the sky to an accuracy of 1 - 2@xmath3 and has been used to identify new transients where the source location was previously unknown ( e.g. , gro j1655 - 40 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for more details of the method , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "most of the 29 category b sources of the eot catalog are strong enough that we might expect to detect them in a 15-day integration ( @xmath06.5@xmath1 for a 25 mcrab source in the 20 - 100 kev band ) . a non - detection , however ,",
    "does not imply that the eot signal does not come from this source , because the application and interpretation of the imaging technique is complex and depends on more than the strength of the source signal and spectral signature .",
    "each of the category b sources was examined over at least one time interval to look for an excess in the image at the source location .",
    "a suitable limb geometry was chosen by displaying the rising and setting limbs over an entire cgro precession period .",
    "this period will contain all possible limb geometries for a given source and allow the selection of the longest consecutive time interval with near - orthogonal rising and setting limbs for the best possible spatial resolution .",
    "images were generated for ten separate source locations within a 10@xmath3 by 10@xmath3 field of view .",
    "the technique is most efficient for imaging sources in the center of the field , but a true signal should appear when the source is offset from the center .",
    "offsets up to 1@xmath3 in each direction were considered and images were produced for lad energy channels 1 through 3 .",
    "although most of the category b sources exhibited at least some variability , the only flux - related selection of integration time intervals was made for those sources that are eclipsing binary systems or systems with a superorbital period .",
    "the rxte asm light curves ( http://xte.mit.edu/asm_lc.html ) allowed the selection of time periods when the x - ray emitter was not eclipsed by its companion and was not occulted by a warped accretion disk in those systems with a known superorbital period .",
    "table 7 summarizes the imaging results .",
    "22 of the 29 category b sources yielded at least one credible image .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining a good limb geometry is apparent in some of the sources where the contours appear elongated . in others ,",
    "the noisiness of the sky was responsible for the lack of image contours associated with the category b source .",
    "figures 16(a - d ) show some of the noteworthy images for the different types of astrophysical objects seen by batse .",
    "the agn 3c 273 has a spectrum hard enough to be imaged in the 100 - 300 kev energy range as seen in fig 16(a ) .",
    "figures 16(c ) and 16(d ) are both taken in the 50 - 100 kev energy range and show good source - centered images of the supernova remnant psr 1508 - 59 and the x - ray binary exo 0748 - 676 respectively .",
    "some source images suffer from source confusion .",
    "in particular 4u 1702 - 429 and 4u 1705 - 440 ( the latter a strong low - energy gamma - ray source in its hard state @xcite ) are close to both each other and to the category a source oao 1657 - 415 but separate contours delineate the sources in at least some of the grid positions .",
    "another case is that of 4u 1812 - 12 , which is close to gx 17 + 2 , a category a source , but has a much harder spectrum .",
    "even when it is offset from the center of the image , the contours may encompass both sources in channel 1 , but gx 17 + 2 drops out in channel 2 and the contours tighten around 4u 1812 - 12 .",
    "although these cases show poorly resolved contours , the spatial resolution is sufficient to support the reported detections of these sources .",
    "the ambiguity often disappears when the source of interest is in the center of the field - of - view , as can be seen in fig 16(b ) where the flux from 4u1812 - 12 ( also called ser x-2 ) swamps that from gx 17 + 2 even in the 20 - 50 kev range .",
    "the batse eot deep sample has interesting implications for future studies .",
    "the deep sample can serve as a guide / comparison tool to an unbiased survey with other instruments such as integral @xcite and _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "there also remains the possibility of an unbiased survey with batse @xcite .",
    "this catalog serves as a first critical analysis of the entire baste dataset , and these results are made available on the world wide web for potential applications , some perhaps unforeseen .",
    "the spectral information from batse were largely unexplored in this work .",
    "for example , it was not practical for us to present an analysis of the long - term spectra in the full 16 channel data that are available . however , we made limited comparisons of our 4-band results to those of the heao 1 survey @xcite , long - term flux averages ( @xmath05 yrs ) of the rxte asm compiled by @xcite , and to pointed instrument observations for agns and lmxb neutron stars from the _ bepposax _ and rxte .",
    "this can be done using the conversion factors given in table a3 , and the crab nebula , which averages about 75 c / s in the 2 - 12 kev asm band . allowing for the differing observation intervals involved",
    ", we find that our 4-band relative rates compare well in cross - checks with these results .",
    "this suggests that the batse data could be used at a next level to obtain duty fractions for these sources in various energy bands .",
    "we find from the category b analysis that some types of sources such as supernova remnants and agns show hard photon emission even into the 160 - 430 kev band as shown in table 5 .",
    "accreting pulsars , in contrast , have relatively hard spectra near the batse threshold and sharp spectral cutoffs at higher energy consistent with our understanding of their emission mechanisms . across the asm ( 2 - 12 kev ) and batse ( 20 - 40 kev ) bands ,",
    "the fluxes reported for the accreting pulsars are within a few @xmath1 agreement for the two instruments .",
    "the high duty fraction lmxb neutron stars with hard x - ray emission from pointed - instrument observations @xcite have fluxes that are also comparable with the averages given in table 5 .    we caution users not to over interpret some results , such as the sources in category c considered as possible detections .",
    "some could indeed be real detections , but represent the limits of the sensitivity of the current version of the batse eot , and the fluxes are dominated by the systematic corrections .",
    "for example , a few x - ray stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ) appear in this category ( none appeared in categories a or b and most are in category n ) , but the fluxes are too weak for testing with the methods employed in sec .",
    "we stress that the category c results definitely can suffer from source confusion and other systematic errors that could easily produce the low - level observed fluxes .",
    "as is , the 4-band relative rates in table 4 for the category c and n sources should be used only to derive upper limits on the 9.1y averages .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "this work was supported by the goddard space flight center compton gamma ray observatory science support center , which is funded by the nasa office of space science .",
    "we also acknowledge the availability of rxte asm data courtesy of the rxte science support center .",

    "the available literature on the results of batse detection and monitoring for transient sources is not always complete .",
    "the difficulty of identifying new sources , in particular , directly stems from the limited spatial resolution and sensitivity of the batse eot .",
    "as discussed in harmon ( 2002 ) , our ability to spatially resolve point sources on the sky is limited by the geometry of the earth s limb at the time of measurement , coupled with the slow change of this geometry ( @xmath0days ) as the spacecraft orbit precesses .",
    "this is compounded by the sometimes brief duration of transient outbursts .",
    "some special notes are provided here regarding activity that was not as well understood at the time of its occurrence .",
    "_ exo 1846 - 031 , gs 1843 + 00 and gs 1845 - 024 _    these sources , occupying a relatively small ( few - degree ) region on the sky , were all detectable at various times in the batse database .",
    "first noted in a deep search of the batse database using epoch folding , a source with a 241 day period was given the name gro j1849 - 03 ( zhang 1996a , 1996b ) . at that time",
    ", the regularity of the outbursts suggested that gro j1849 - 03 was a hmxb , but pulsations were not detected .",
    "later sensitivity enhancements in batse pulsar analysis , however , revealed 94-s pulsations detected at times of outbursts .",
    "this observation , combined with a pulse arrival timing analysis that revealed an orbital period of @xmath52 days , identified gro j184903 with gs 1845024 ( finger 1999 ) .",
    "a more precise positional confirmation was also made with the wide field camera on _ bepposax _ ( soffitta 1998 ) .",
    "batse observed short - lived transients with a hard spectrum in 1993 ( harmon 1993 ) and slightly less than a year later ( zhang 1994 ) in this same region of the sky .",
    "the spectral shape , both times , was reminiscent of a bhc .",
    "unfortunately , the limb geometry was not sufficiently to locate the source to more than a few degrees in one direction within the few days that the outbursts were observable . a follow - up observation two weeks",
    "after the 1994 outburst did not indicate any unusual optical activity in the vicinity of exo 1846 - 031 ( grindlay , garcia , & zhao 1994 ) .",
    "the batse error boxes were consistent with the reported discovery location of the black hole transient exo 1846 - 031 ( parmar 1993 ) , and so we tentatively identified the outbursts with this source ( zhang 1994 ) .    in table 3 , we include the regular outbursts of gs 1845 - 024 , a single outburst of the pulsar gs 1843 + 00 ( wilson 1997b ) and the two outbursts with hard spectra attributed to exo 1846 - 031 .",

    "a study of its properties with _ granat _",
    "( vargas 1997 ) indicated that the source , named grs 1739 - 278 , probably contained a black hole . because of its proximity ( @xmath01@xmath3 ) to a bright source discovered with batse only a few months earlier ( gro j1744 - 28 or  bursting pulsar \" ) ( fishman 1995 ; kouveliotou 1996 ) , it was difficult to separate the fluxes from the two sources .",
    "the first observations showing a clear detection of grs 1739 - 278 by rxte / asm was on tjd 10143 ( 1 mar 1996 ) , although a single measurement exists on tjd 10101 ( 19 january 1996 ) that indicates about a 3@xmath1 detection .",
    "greiner , dennerl , & predehl ( 1996 ) made a follow - up observation to the _ granat _ discovery on tjd 10158 ( 18 mar 1996 ) to get a more accurate location for the x - ray counterpart , and discovered a substantial x - ray scattering halo .",
    "due to the delay in arrival time of the scattered photons , the rosat results implied that the source could have first appeared as early as 1995 november - december .",
    "a very sparsely sampled batse light curve for grs 1739 - 278 indicated the source was visible as early as @xmath010035 ( 14 nov 1995 ) at a level of @xmath0200 mcrab in the 20 - 100 kev band , and decaying below the source confusion limit ( @xmath050 mcrab ) in the galactic center region by @xmath010497 ( 18 feb 1997 ) .",
    "these beginning and ending dates for the outburst were entered into the flare database and table 3 .    _ rxte transients xte j1550 - 564 , xte j1859 + 226 , xte j1118 + 480 , xte j1543 - 568 , xte j0111 - 7317 and v4641 sgr ( sagittarius ) _",
    "these transients were discovered in outburst by rxte during the final years of the cgro mission .",
    "several of these transients were quite bright and + reached a crab or more in the batse energy bandpass .",
    "the rxte / asm , which was designed to quickly locate and monitor new transients , generally was able to report these outbursts rapidly , sometimes even before batse data containing the same transient were received for processing .",
    "it is interesting scientifically , as well as important to our accounting of bright sources , to examine archival data for these transients , especially prior to the launch of rxte in 1995 .    as part of the deep sample ,",
    "light curves were generated for xte j1550 - 564 , xte j1859 + 226 , xte j1118 + 480 , xte j1543 - 568 , xte j0111 - 7317 and v4641 sgr .",
    "all showed detectable outbursts as recorded in table 3 .",
    "examination of light curves from the beginning of the cgro mission in april 1991 prior to the known outbursts occurring at various times after december 1995 did not show any emission more than five successive days greater than @xmath0100 mcrab intensity in the 20 - 100 kev band .",
    "outbursts of lesser duration and intensity could possibly be present in the dataset , but require more in - depth analysis .",
    "pulse height data from the batse large area detectors were normally acquired into 128 high energy resolution ( her ) channels . due to telemetry limits ,",
    "the her data were mapped into 16 broader energy channels and read out at 2.048s to create the continuous ( cont ) background data .",
    "eot measurements were made with the cont dataset . normally the cont channel bin edges were kept to a constant set of values , that , coupled with the lad gain control , kept the effective energy loss pulse height response per channel extremely stable . however , on rare occasions , the 128 to 16 channel mapping was changed to accommodate a greater energy dispersion when observations of sources with softer spectra and possible line features were desired ( e.g. , accreting pulsars or soft gamma - ray repeaters ) .",
    "table b1 shows several mapping schemes ( numbered 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4a and 4b ) that were used during the mission and the times in which these were applied . from column 2 , it can be seen that scheme 2 was used about 90% of the time .",
    "schemes 2 , 3 , 4a and 4b had in common several of the same her channels for which we could obtain 4-energy band data spanning changes in the her to cont channel mapping . using the crab fluxes as a standard candle , a tool was created for which the flux of any source relative to the crab could be generated in the energy bands 20 - 40 , 40 - 70 , 70 - 160 and 160 - 430 kev .",
    "the crab relative rates quoted in tables 4 and 5 can be converted to photon number per kev ( ph @xmath14s@xmath15 kev@xmath15 ) or energy flux per band using the multipliers given in table b2 .",
    "note that this method of four - band conversion to crab relative rates can not be used for schemes 0 or 1 , and so data before tjd 8406/81139 and for the brief intervals tjd 8807/8279 - 8809/64510 and 8812/65817 - 8812/66102 can not be treated in this manner .",
    "table b3 is a list of days when unusual or anomalous events occurred during the cgro mission and no earth occultation measurements could be extracted .",
    "these events produced gaps in most or all source flux histories at the given times .",
    "routine events causing loss of measurements such as source interference , exceeding the critical angle for earth occultation , or telemetry gaps are not included .",
    "table b3 gives the times , data condition reported , and the cause of the anomaly .",
    "skelton ( 1994 ) , ling ( 1996 , 2000 ) and co - workers at the jet propulsion laboratory developed an earth occultation software package over a period of several years with the intent to generate higher sensitivity results than can be obtained with the treatment described in harmon ( 2002 ) .",
    "the jpl package is known as the enhanced batse occultation package ( ebop ) and has been applied to batse data independent of the efforts at msfc .",
    "ling ( 2000 ) published a compendium of measurements ( also called a catalog ) for the 1991 may to 1994 october epoch .",
    "we feel it is very important to compare the results from ebop with those of this work , since there are significant discrepancies between what we report and what can be found in ling ( 2000 ) .",
    "primarily , there are two major differences between the jpl method and the method used here .",
    "first , ebop uses a semi - physical model for the detector background counting rates .",
    "the model is based on expected contributions of low - energy gamma - ray fluxes local to the low earth orbit ( leo ) environment .",
    "these include cosmic ray secondary radiation and activation products from orbital passes through radiation fields in leo .",
    "the jpl global background model consists of a mix of the local radiation components and a combination ( determined by the fit ) of the batse spectroscopic detector ( fishman 1989a , b ) counting rates as a predictor of the low - energy background in the lads .",
    "secondly , the extraction of source signals is usually performed in one - day segments , with a single fit including terms for _ all _ sources in the ebop catalog with no _ a priori _ assumptions of their intensity .",
    "the main goal of this work is increase sensitivity by fitting much longer intervals of background data than the four minutes typically used in our work , which does not require a sophisticated background model .    in table c1 , we compare selected results for a few sources from the deep sample in table 4 and the ebop catalog ( ling 2000 ) .",
    "to best illustrate the comparison , we selected sources over a range of flux intensities , as well as to pick sources that did not show a large degree of variability on timescales of months to years .",
    "table c1 shows fluxes in three selected energy bands with centroid energies that overlap in ebop and the table 4 deep sample .",
    "results from the deep sample are quoted with and without systematic error corrections .",
    "the ebop results are reported as minimum and maximum average fluxes for for several @xmath0400 day intervals in table 3 of ling ( 2000 ) .",
    "the deep sample results are the 9.1y averages from this work ( table 4 ) converted from mcrab to photon flux with the multiplicative factors from table b2 .",
    "for the crab , the two methods give very similar results , and confirm the cross - check of the of the two methods from ling ( 2000 ) .",
    "sources of moderate intensity , such as 4u 1700 - 37 and ngc 4151 , show significant discrepancies , particularly for the highest of the three energy bands .",
    "for relatively weak sources at the few mcrab level , such as the lmxb circinus x-1 , the supernova remnant psr 1509 - 58 , and the seyfert galaxy ngc 1275 , our average fluxes are roughly an order of magnitude less than the ebop results . for sct x-1",
    ", we only show upper limits ( @xmath162@xmath1 ) ( corrected for systematic error ) , whereas the jpl method yielded significant broad - band emission at least an order of magnitude higher .",
    "to make sure that the time interval for which the averages were constructed was not a major factor in the comparison , we generated long term spectra for tjd 8393 - 8800 as was done in ling ( 2000 ) .",
    "figures 17a and 17b show the broad - band spectra of cir x-1 and and psr 1509 - 58 using the msfc method with no systematic error correction applied , the ebop results from ling ( 2000 ) , and the table 4-band average fluxes with systematic error corrections .",
    "the broad - band spectra from the jpl and msfc methods are considerably different over most of the sensitive energy range of the lads .",
    "differences between the broad - band msfc data and the 4-band averages for cir x-1 are mostly caused by the large systematic error correction for that source .",
    "the findings reflect the same conclusions made using table c1 .",
    "ling ( 2000 ) discuss sources of error for the earth occultation analysis specific to ebop in some detail and point out that the high energy fluxes they see for some sources such as sct x-1 and ngc 1275 should be viewed with caution . since we observe considerably lower fluxes for these and other sources in the 160 - 430 kev band , it suggests that their concern could be justified .",
    "here we point out possible reasons for the discrepancy between our work and the ebop results .",
    "one possibility concerns unaccounted for components in the gamma - ray background for which the lads have significant sensitivity , but are not included in the jpl model .",
    "we have found that , when fitting the background near occultation steps for more than a few minutes , there is an increased likelihood for slow , very significant variations to cause the measured background to be considerably different from the assumed model .",
    "these variations are not associated in any way with occultation steps .",
    "such effects could be high energy diffuse emission from the galactic plane or unusual local background variations on specific days ( e.g. , solar activity or electron precipitation events ) that can affect the computed level of the background in the high energy ( a few hundred kev ) data .",
    "these variations from the model can be transferred to source terms which are fit simultaneously with the background .",
    "another possibility is the assumed set of sources used by the jpl method .",
    "jpl used a set of 64 sources , all of which are fit simultaneously , regardless of any intensity or time information .",
    "our catalog consisted of 179 sources , however , no more than 10 sources were fit simultaneously in the msfc method , and usually only 1 - 3 per 4-minute fitting window were typical .",
    "this reduces the tendency toward large scale coupling between source terms , and presupposes that we have partial information about what sources a detector is likely to be seeing .",
    "this may not explain anomalously large fluxes at high energy in the jpl data , but it can help to explain the tendency to yield fluxes higher than the msfc method for lower intensity sources . although a finite source set is also a problem for the msfc method , the strategy was to iteratively improve characterization of the sources in the catalog based on average brightness , times of transient activity , and to use a source set taken from published catalogs .",
    "our method therefore yields improved results by having a better knowledge of source activity each time a pass through the dataset is performed .",

    "<S> the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) , aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( cgro ) , provided a record of the low - energy gamma - ray sky ( @xmath020 - 1000 kev ) between 1991 april and 2000 may ( 9.1y ) . </S>",
    "<S> batse monitored the high energy sky using the earth occultation technique ( eot ) for point sources whose emission extended for times on the order of the cgro orbital period ( @xmath092 min ) or greater . </S>",
    "<S> using the eot to extract flux information , a catalog of sources using data from the batse large area detectors has been prepared . </S>",
    "<S> the first part of the catalog consists of results from the all - sky monitoring of 58 sources , mostly galactic , with intrinsic variability on timescales of hours to years . for these sources </S>",
    "<S> , we have included tables of flux and spectral data , and outburst times for transients . </S>",
    "<S> light curves ( or flux histories ) have been placed on the world wide web .    </S>",
    "<S> we then performed a deep - sampling of these 58 objects , plus a selection of 121 more objects , combining data from the entire 9.1y batse dataset . </S>",
    "<S> source types considered were primarily accreting binaries , but a small number of representative active galaxies , x - ray - emitting stars , and supernova remnants were also included . </S>",
    "<S> the sample represents a compilation of sources monitored and/or discovered with batse and other high energy instruments between 1991 and 2000 , known sources taken from the heao 1 a-4 @xcite and @xcite catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> the deep sample results include definite detections of 83 objects and possible detections of 36 additional objects . </S>",
    "<S> the definite detections spanned three classes of sources : accreting black hole and neutron star binaries , active galaxies and supernova remnants . </S>",
    "<S> the average fluxes measured for the fourth class , the x - ray emitting stars , were below the confidence limit for definite detection . </S>",
    "<S> flux data for the deep sample are presented in four energy bands : 20 - 40 , 40 - 70 , 70 - 160 , and 160 - 430 kev . the limiting average flux level ( 9.1 y ) for the sample varies from 3.5 to 20 mcrab ( 5@xmath1 ) between 20 and 430 kev , depending on systematic error , which in turn is primarily dependent on the sky location . to strengthen the credibility of detection of weaker sources ( @xmath05 - 25 mcrab ) , we generated earth occultation images , searched for periodic behavior using fft and epoch folding methods , and critically evaluated the energy - dependent emission in the four flux bands . </S>",
    "<S> the deep sample results are intended for guidance in performing future all - sky surveys or pointed observations in the hard x - ray and low - energy gamma - ray band , as well as more detailed studies with the batse eot .    </S>",
