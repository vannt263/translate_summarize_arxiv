    "let @xmath4 be a compact complex manifold .",
    "we denoted by @xmath5 for the complex dimension of @xmath4 .",
    "a basic invariant for @xmath4 is _ the algebraic dimension _ , which is usually denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "this is defined as the transcendental degree over @xmath7 of the field of meromorphic functions on @xmath4 , and thus roughly measures how many meromorphic functions exist on @xmath4 . for any compact complex manifold @xmath4",
    "we have @xmath8 .",
    "we have @xmath9 iff @xmath4 has only constant meromorphic functions , and @xmath10 iff @xmath4 is bimeromorphically equivalent to a projective algebraic manifold . for any @xmath4 , there exists a projective algebraic manifold @xmath11 and a surjective meromorphic map @xmath12 which induces an isomorphism for the meromorphic function fields of @xmath11 and @xmath4 , so that @xmath13 ; the meromorphic map @xmath12 is called _ the algebraic reduction _ of @xmath4 , and is known to be unique under a bimeromorphic equivalence .",
    "moreover , fibers of @xmath14 are necessarily connected .",
    "if @xmath15 , a general fiber of the algebraic reduction is always an elliptic curve ; this is a consequence of the fact that the degree of the canonical bundle of an algebraic curve is zero only when it is an elliptic curve . in the case @xmath16 and @xmath17 , a possible list of a general fiber of the algebraic reduction is obtained in @xcite ; basically the surfaces in the list are surfaces with non - positive kodaira dimension .",
    "when @xmath4 is 3-dimensional and belongs to the class @xmath18 , structure of a possible general fiber of algebraic reduction is determined by a.fujiki ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , theorem ) .",
    "but when @xmath19 , it is not easy to construct a ( non - trivial ) example of @xmath4 with @xmath20 which has a surface in the list as a general fiber of the algebraic reduction .    as is noticed by f.campana , c.lebrun , y.s.poon , m.ville and others , the so called _ the twistor spaces _ associated to self - dual metrics on real 4-manifolds provide examples of compact complex threefold @xmath21 which satisfies @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "some interesting examples are the twistor spaces of a ricci - flat khler metric on a complex torus and a k3 surface with the complex orientation reversed ; the algebraic reduction of these twistor spaces is a natural holomorphic projection to @xmath24 , which is differentiably a fiber bundle over @xmath24 whose fibers are a complex torus or a k3 surface respectively .",
    "also , a hopf surface has a conformally flat structure whose twistor space enjoys a similar property .",
    "further , in the case of hopf surfaces , fujiki @xcite showed that if @xmath23 , a general fiber of its algebraic reduction is either a hopf surface or a ruled surface over an elliptic curve .",
    "( we will call the latter as an elliptic ruled surface in the sequel . )",
    "these twistor spaces are quotient of @xmath25 minus two skew lines by a free linear @xmath26-action .    as examples of a different flavor , by donaldson - friedman @xcite , lebrun - poon @xcite , poon @xcite and others , if @xmath27 , the connected sum @xmath1 of @xmath0 copies of the complex projective planes admits a self - dual metric whose twistor space @xmath21 satisfies @xmath23 . for these examples ,",
    "the algebraic reduction is induced by the natural square root @xmath28 of the anti - canonical line bundle of @xmath21 , and from this , it may be readily seen , with a help of a useful result by pedersen - poon @xcite , that a general fiber of the algebraic reduction is a rational surface . thus rational surfaces actually occur as a general fiber of the algebraic reduction of a twistor space on @xmath1 if @xmath27 .",
    "also , it is not difficult to see that , for any twistor space @xmath21 on @xmath29 , other complex surfaces can not be a general fiber of the algebraic reduction for @xmath21 with @xmath23 .",
    "however , to the best of the author s knowledge , no example is known so far of a twistor space of algebraic dimension one on @xmath1 having any other surfaces in the list as a general fiber of the algebraic reduction .    in this article , we show that _ there exists a twistor space @xmath21 on @xmath1 satisfying @xmath30 whose general fiber of the algebraic reduction is birational to ( i ) a ruled surface over an elliptic curve , or ( ii ) a k3 surface . _",
    "the former type of twistor spaces are constructed over @xmath1 for arbitrary @xmath2 , while the latter is constructed only over @xmath3 . the algebraic reduction for both of these twistor spaces",
    "is induced by the anti - canonical system of the twistor space , and it is a pencil , having base curves .",
    "we briefly explain characteristic features of these twistor spaces .",
    "the twistor spaces with the pencil of elliptic ruled surfaces have a particular pair of rational curves which are base curves of the anti - canonical pencil .",
    "moreover these are _ double curves _ of the elliptic ruled surfaces .",
    "in particular , the surfaces are non - normal .",
    "these surfaces are obtained from their normalization by identifying each of two disjoint sections of the ruling by an involution on each .",
    "( this is why the two double curves are not elliptic but rational . )",
    "these twistor spaces admit a @xmath31-action , and each member of the pencil is @xmath31-invariant .",
    "there exists a reducible member of the pencil , whose irreducible components consist of two surfaces which are birational to _ a hopf surface_. the intersection of the two components is a non - singular elliptic curve , and it is a single orbit of the @xmath31-action . on the other hand , the twistor spaces with the pencil of k3 surfaces",
    "do not admit a @xmath31-action , and the base locus of the pencil consists of a pair of chains of curves formed by four rational curves . from the second betti number",
    ", these twistor spaces do not seem to have a direct generalization to the case @xmath32 .    at a technical level ,",
    "both of these twistor spaces are characterized by the property that they contain a rational surface of special kinds whose twice is an anti - canonical divisor of the twistor space .",
    "the most difficult part for analyzing the structure is to show that under this condition on the presence of the rational surface , the anti - canonical system is necessarily a pencil .",
    "this is shown by using a variation formula for the euler characteristic for a line bundle under a blow - up whose center is a curve .",
    "we apply the formula for a particular line bundle and the rational curves , which lead to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we first construct a rational elliptic surface @xmath33 admitting a non - trivial @xmath31-action , which satisfies @xmath34 .",
    "next we blowup this surface at fixed points of the @xmath31-action , and obtain a rational surface @xmath35 with @xmath31-action which satisfies @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "then we investigate the linear system @xmath38 for any @xmath39 .    by _ a real structure _ on a complex manifold , we mean an anti - holomorphic involution on it . throughout this section",
    "@xmath40 denotes a smooth elliptic curve equipped with :    * a real structure @xmath41 without fixed point , * a holomorphic involution @xmath42 which has 4 fixed points , and which commutes with @xmath41 .    also on the complex projective line @xmath24",

    "on the product @xmath44 , the holomorphic involution @xmath42 has exactly 8 fixed points .",

    "this quotient surface also has a real structure induced by that on @xmath44 .",
    "the projection @xmath46 induces a holomorphic map @xmath47 , which defines a structure of elliptic surface over @xmath48 on the quotient surface .",

    "the real structure on @xmath45 naturally lifts to @xmath33 , and we still denote it by @xmath41 .",

    "we note that the surface @xmath33 is uniquely determined by the isomorphism class of the initial elliptic curve @xmath40 . taking the composition with the above projection @xmath50",

    "this @xmath31-action on @xmath33 is compatible with the above elliptic fibration @xmath60 , and induces a non - trivial but non - effective @xmath31-action on the base space @xmath24 .",
    "* all regular fibers of @xmath61 are isomorphic to @xmath40 , and are mutually identified by the @xmath31-action .",
    "the two singular fibers of @xmath61 are @xmath31-invariant , and among their components only the double components @xmath56 and @xmath62 are point - wise fixed by the @xmath31-action .",

    "evidently the real structure and the @xmath31-action on @xmath33 naturally lift on the surface @xmath35 .",
