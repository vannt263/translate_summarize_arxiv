    "the recent measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the planck collaboration @xcite has found excellent agreement with the paradigm of slow - roll , small - field inflation . in particular , the fluctuations seem to be adiabatic and gaussian , with a slightly tilted power spectrum , confirming the generic predictions of slow - roll single - field inflation . also , there are no signs of tensor perturbations , which is expected for small - field models , but puts tension on popular large - field models of inflation .",
    "new inflation @xcite , in which inflation is driven by a scalar field that slowly rolls from a hilltop towards its global minimum , is an attractive class of models which can generate cmb perturbations inside the planck experiment s 1@xmath4 bounds .",
    "it also allows interesting connections between inflation and particle physics .",
    "as the inflaton takes on a vacuum expectation value after inflation , it can be identified with a symmetry - breaking higgs field which breaks e.g.  an extended gauge symmetry @xcite or some family symmetry @xcite . if the symmetry breaking produces any dangerous topological defects , those are produced at the beginning of inflation and are automatically diluted away by the subsequent exponential expansion . also , the field values during new inflation stay well below the planck scale , which makes it possible to derive predictions within an effective field theory without making strong assumptions about planck scale physics .    however , when models of new inflation are implemented in supergravity @xcite , the inflaton is a complex and not a real scalar field . as a complex scalar field has two independent components , supergravity models of new inflation",
    "are naturally two - field models . in this paper",
    ", we want to analyse how this two - field behaviour modifies the usual single - field predictions .",
    "we discuss for which model parameters the model reduces to the well - known single - field model , and how the predictions are modified otherwise .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first we introduce the inflaton potential , including the superpotential and khler potential from which the inflaton potential is derived .",
    "afterwards , we analytically study the initial conditions and field trajectories to understand under which conditions the model reduces to a single - field model , and under which conditions we expect that the multi - field dynamics should influence the inflationary predictions .",
    "finally , we use the @xmath0 formalism to numerically calculate the predictions of the two - field model .",
    "we finish with a brief summary of our results .",
    "in this paper , we will study new inflation with the inflaton potential @xmath5 for the real scalar fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which can be thought of as components of a complex scalar field @xmath8 .",
    "note that the inflaton potential is invariant under transformations @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these symmetries are also obvious in fig .",

    "if @xmath16 , our assumption is now valid . otherwise , we can follow up with a symmetry transformation @xmath9 to get @xmath17 . ]",
    "we only consider the case @xmath18 in which the inflaton slow - rolls down the potential ; for @xmath19 the inflaton would be stuck at the local minimum at @xmath20 and would have to tunnel to reach the global minimum .",
    "inflaton potentials of the form of eq .   can be constructed from different superpotentials and khler potentials .",
    "one possibility , used e.g.  in @xcite , is the superpotential @xmath21 with the superfields @xmath22 and @xmath23 and model parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "we use natural units with @xmath27 to keep the notation simple .",
    "we also include the leading terms in an expansion of the khler potential @xmath28 the scalar f - term potential for chiral superfields can be calculated from @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the formula @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the matrix inverse of the khler metric @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 given by eqs .   and , the scalar potential is @xmath35 we assume that @xmath36 so that the scalar component of @xmath22 has a mass above the hubble scale @xmath37 and is stabilized at 0 during inflation .",

    "in a multi - field model of inflation , the predictions can depend on the initial conditions . in this section ,",

    "we start from the assumption that at some point in time , the field is very close to @xmath42 .",
    "such a state can be generated dynamically e.g.  by a period of preinflation @xcite .",

    "the inflaton @xmath23 now sits at its `` initial value '' @xmath20 and can start slow - rolling down its potential .      when @xmath42 , the friedmann equations imply that the field does not move away from @xmath20 at all .",

    ", these quantum fluctuations dominate over the classical evolution ; we call this area the quantum diffusion region .",
    "after some time , however , @xmath23 has randomly walked away into some region where the potential is steep enough for the classical evolution to take over and the inflaton rolls away from @xmath42 , down the potential gradient towards the nearest minimum .",

    "not surprisingly , the size of @xmath70 determines where the transition between the two phases takes place : for larger @xmath70 , the growing phase lasts longer .",
