    "* bistable transition of p5ga hairpin under constant tension :* to study the dynamics of biopolymers under tension , we used the self - organized polymer ( sop ) model , a new class of versatile coarse - grained model that have been proven powerful in describing diverse problems in biomolecular dynamics at single molecule level , which includes proteins , rna , and molecular motors @xcite . among the molecules",
    "studied using sop model , the 22-nucleotide p5ga rna hairpin is the simplest one , whose dynamics was studied under various mechanical conditions such as force clamp and force ramp ( see methods ) , providing microscopic insights into rna hairpins in single molecule force experiments @xcite . here , we performed brownian dynamics simulation of the rna hairpin under varying tensions ( see methods ) . as shown previously @xcite ,",
    "the time trajectories that describe the dynamics of molecular extension ( @xmath2 ) show that the rna hairpin undergoes thermally - induced hopping transitions when the molecule is held around the transition mid - force @xmath3 .",
    "the force - dependent free energy profile @xmath4 with @xmath5 k , calculated from the distribution of molecular extension @xmath6 , becomes bistable at @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) by forming the native basin of attraction ( nba ) and unfolded basin of attraction ( uba ) at @xmath9 nm and @xmath10 nm , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) .",
    "the tension greater ( or smaller ) than @xmath3 , @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) tilts the free energy profile towards the uba ( or nba )",
    ". the force - dependent probability of being in the uba @xmath13 is calculated using @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the extension corresponding to the barrier top ( transition state ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) are the minimum and maximum extensions , respectively .",

    "[ fig:1]b ) . from the time trajectories",
    ", the @xmath23-dependent mean folding ( @xmath24 ) and unfolding time ( @xmath25 ) are also calculated and found to  approximately \" obey the bell - like relation @xcite ( fig .  [ fig:1]c ) .",
    "it is of note that the deviation from linearity on a log folding time scale is due to moving transition state resulting from the underlying folding landscape that deforms under mechanical force @xcite . + * oscillation - induced coherent transition of the p5ga hairpin :* according to theories , the nonlinear and bistable characteristics of the folding landscape of rna hairpin guarantee the manifestation of sr and ra if an oscillatory driving is externally applied to the molecule just like the sr discussed in the context of brownian particle on a bistable potential .",
    "however , given that there are many degrees of freedom whose dynamics experiences continuous dissipation over time , it is not obvious whether a small oscillatory force added to the rna can indeed be sensed along the backbone of biopolymer and renders the folding transition synchronous to the oscillatory force . for proteins and rnas where entropy play dominant role in shaping the underlying free energy landscape , the thermal noise strength ( temperature ) , kept at a physiological condition , is not a good variable to vary .",
    "instead , it would be more appropriate to vary the frequency of oscillatory force .",
    "to this end , we performed the many - body simulations using sop model by applying a small oscillatory force @xmath26 with @xmath27 pn to the 5-end of p5ga hairpin at @xmath28 pn and monitor the change in folding - unfolding dynamics , for various driving frequencies @xmath29 .",
    "our many - body simulations using the sop model of rna hairpin show that although the probability of being in the nba at @xmath28 pn is only @xmath30 % so that the folding is improbable , folding transitions occur more frequently and in coherence to a small oscillatory force at the period of @xmath31 ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c ) . here , it is noteworthy that @xmath32 for our rna hairpin at @xmath28 pn is similar to the sum of the two transition times in the absence of oscillatory driving , @xmath33 ms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c at @xmath28 pn ) , a theoretically well - known sr condition for symmetric bistable potential @xcite . +",
    "* mapping p5ga dynamics onto one - dimensional free energy profile :* to explore the details of sr and ra in the dynamics of rna hairpin more extensively , we simplified our many - body simulation using sop model into one - dimensional ( 1d ) simulation by showing that the dynamics of molecular extension @xmath34 from many - body dynamics can effectively be projected onto the dynamics of a quasi - particle under the 1d free energy profile @xmath35 . by using @xmath23-dependent free energy profile @xmath36 where the @xmath37 is directly interpolated from the energy profile at @xmath38 pn obtained by the sop simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , we modeled an associated langevin dynamics of the quasi - particle with a position @xmath34 as follows : @xmath39 . here , @xmath40 is the effective friction coefficient and @xmath41 is the random force that satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath42 with @xmath43 . folding and unfolding times , determined from time trajectories @xmath34 on @xmath35 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are in excellent agreements with those from the sop model ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) ( fig .  [",
    "fig:1]c ) .",
    "in addition , by imposing reflecting boundary condition at @xmath46 nm and @xmath47 nm , which are the minimum and maximum molecular extension , we analytically calculated the mean first passage ( kramers ) times @xmath48 for the folding and @xmath49 for the unfolding .",
    "we set the effective diffusion constant @xmath50 @xmath51 to match @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) ( solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c ) to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) at @xmath54 from the simulation results using sop model ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c ) .    the excellent agreement among differently calculated mean transition times @xmath55 justifies mapping the many - body dynamics of p5ga hairpin under varying @xmath23 onto the dynamics on 1d free energy profile described with molecular extension , @xmath2 . in fact , previous studies showed that @xmath2 is a good reaction coordinate on which both thermodynamics and kinetics of p5ga hairpin are faithfully described as long as @xmath23 does not greatly differ from @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this enables us to explore sr and ra of the rna folding - unfolding dynamics in a simpler way without compromising the goal of our study . to take into account the effect of external oscillatory force",
    ", we simply added a term @xmath56 ; thus , the stochastic equation describing the dynamics of @xmath34 in the presence of external oscillatory signal reads as follows : @xmath57 + * resonant activation in the folding and unfolding transitions of rna hairpins :* to investigate the effect of oscillatory driving on transition kinetics , we calculated the average folding time @xmath58 as a function of @xmath59 for time trajectories generated using eq.[eq : sv ] at @xmath28 pn for @xmath27 , 2.0 pn or unfolding time @xmath60 at @xmath61 pn for @xmath62 , 1.4 pn ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we found that the external oscillatory signal accelerates both folding and unfolding dynamics and maximizes the transition rates @xmath63defined by @xmath64 at @xmath65 ms by about 60 % and 30 % for both folding and unfolding , compared with those in the absence of the oscillatory driving .",
    "the enhancement of folding ( unfolding ) rate could still be called ra , following the theoretical studies on symmetric bistable potential @xcite .",
    "the presence of optimal condition of @xmath66 that minimizes the transition time indicates that there should be a matching condition for two frequencies between conformational fluctuation in folding landscape , which is induced by thermal noise , and the oscillation of input signal . for @xmath67 ,",
    "net driving force provided by the fast oscillating force is essentially zero ; @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath69 , the molecule experiences external tension that slowly varies between @xmath70 and @xmath71 during the transition time @xmath72 depending on the time interval @xmath73 . as a result , for @xmath74",
    "ms , @xmath58 at @xmath28 pn and @xmath27 pn varies between 2 ms and 30 ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c ) , and the corresponding mean folding time becomes @xmath75 ms as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a , which is greater than the @xmath76 ms at @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the extent of ra varies with the amplitude of oscillatory force ( @xmath77 ) ( compare circles and squares in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "it is conceivable that @xmath78 where @xmath79 nm at @xmath28 pn ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) provides extra work to rectify the random fluctuation of molecule in uba .",
    "therefore , the ratio of @xmath78 to free energy barrier @xmath80 from the uba to nba , i.e. , @xmath81 should determine the enhancement of folding rate at the ra condition . + * stochastic resonance in the refolding dynamics of rna :* folding time distributions @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b ) calculated from time trajectories ( fig .  [ fig:4]a ) are useful measure for characterizing sr . at fast driving @xmath83 ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b-1 ) , @xmath82 decays exponentially with a decay time 10.5 ms , which is consistent with the folding time in the absence of driving , @xmath84 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig:1]c ) .",
    "but at @xmath85 ms near the resonant condition , @xmath82 displays multiple peaks whose periodicity corresponds to the driving period of input signal , which is approximately equal to @xmath84 ( fig .  [ fig:4]b-2 ) .",
    "the multiple peaks are superimposed on the above - mentioned exponentially decaying contribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b-1 ) @xcite . at a slow driving @xmath86 ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b-3 ) , the @xmath82 has a broad and small peak around 25 ms and shows only a weak signature of coherence .    the degree of synchronization is quantified by calculating the @xmath87 value corresponding to the area under the first peak of @xmath82 , which is defined as @xmath88 where the integration is done over a time interval between @xmath89 and @xmath90 that defines the first peak in the @xmath82 @xcite . for example , for @xmath83",
    "ms , the @xmath82 exponentially decreases with no peak , thus @xmath91 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath82s with @xmath85 ms and 40.96 ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b-2 and [ fig:4]b-3 ) have the first peaks around 7 ms and 25 ms , respectively , leading to non - zero @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 calculated for the data @xmath82 of our 1d simulation for p5ga hairpin ( filled circles in fig .",

    "[ fig:4]d .",
    "we find that the unfolding is also synchronized with an optimal driving period around @xmath99 ms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c ) .",
    "thus , rna folding ( unfolding ) becomes maximally coherent at @xmath100 . due to asymmetric shape of potential leading to @xmath101 ,",
    "the sr condition for folding becomes @xmath102 , which is worth comparing with the conventional sr condition @xmath103 for symmetric bistable systems .",
    "there are many alternative measures to demonstrate the manifestation of sr .",
    "one measure , directly amenable to experiment , is the power spectrum @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes ensemble and long time averages for the trajectory @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath106 shows a narrow sharp peak with the frequency @xmath107 ms@xmath108 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b-2 ) .",
    "in addition , spectral behavior of dynamic susceptibility defined @xmath109 , which also becomes optimal at @xmath110 ms@xmath108 , can be used to quantify the response of system to an external driving force . +",
    "* biopolymers can filter the resonance frequency from the spectrum of an external signal :* due to the multitude of cellular processes nonequilibrium noise in the cell is decomposed into various frequencies . to check",
    "if our model can discriminate the resonant frequency using sr , we performed the 1d simulation for rna hopping transitions under @xmath28 pn by adding oscillatory forces consisting of different angular frequencies @xmath111 where @xmath112 ms@xmath108 , @xmath113 ms@xmath108 and @xmath114 ms@xmath108 ; here , the optimal folding period for the sr , @xmath115 ms , is included in the @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath82 for uniform amplitudes of the additive forces with @xmath117 pn ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) displays an oscillatory pattern with multiple peaks , suggesting that the folding is synchronous with the oscillatory force with the period @xmath32 . even for the case of nonuniform amplitudes , in which @xmath118 and @xmath119 have greater values than @xmath120 , the signature of synchronization to the oscillatory driving with @xmath32 is retained ( fig .  [ fig:5 ] )",
    "furthermore , even when we choose @xmath77 randomly from the values distributed between 0 and 2 pn at every time setp , we still found the @xmath82 with multiple peaks , which suggests that the p5ga system is capable of filtering the signal with frequency of @xmath121 out of the nonequilibrium noise . + * experimental demonstration of sr in biomolecular dynamics :* although the results discussed above are based on the numerical simulation that applies mechanical force directly acting to the ends of rna hairpin without mediating polymer handle as in actual optical tweezers experiment , our findings on sr and ra conditions for folding transition should not change qualitatively .",
    "as quantitatively discussed by hyeon _",
    "_ @xcite as well as recognized by others @xcite , the presence of handle polymers simply slows down the transition kinetics by pinning the motion of the two end points of biopolymers connected to the handles .",
    "furthermore , in all practical situations , the conformational transition time of biopolymers is much slower than the tension propagation time @xcite .",
    "therefore , even in the presence of handles sr is still realized at the optimal frequency , corresponding to the sum of the folding and unfolding transition times that are measured in the presence of handles .",
    "many - body simulation using sop model of rna hairpin in the presence of 20 nm handles attached to the two ends of hairpin confirms the realization of sr in the presence of handles ( see _ si text _ and fig.s1 ) . for the purpose of experimental demonstration of sr using biopolymers",
    ", it is recommended that the experiment is conducted at the transition mid - force ( @xmath3 ) , at which the folding and unfolding transitions are the most frequently observed @xcite ( fig.s2 ) . in this case , sr condition is expected to be formed around twice the mean hopping transition time ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "originally , the sr refers to the phenomenological observation that a system under an optimal thermal noise can amplify a weak external signal if the system is nonlinear .",
    "this paper restates the sr and ra condition by focusing more on the transition dynamics of biopolymers rather than the amplification of signal . furthermore , unlike the many studies that consider the sr using noise strength , i.e. , temperature , as a variable , the present study focuses on the  bona - fide sr \" with respect to the driving frequency . for biologically relevant environment ,",
    "whose temperature range should be narrowly defined , it is more appropriate to consider the effect of driving frequency on sr . folding and unfolding transitions of biopolymers enhanced under and synchronized to an external periodic signals , which is clearly demonstrated in our simulations , suggest that as long as the sr condition is met , conformational sampling of biopolymers in vivo occurs more frequently than in vitro , in response to the spectrum of athermal noise in the cell .",
    "true manifestation of sr and ra in the context of biopolymer dynamics in vivo should hinge on existence of the actual periodic frequency that is in resonance to the transition dynamics of biopolymer .",
    "it would be of great interest to investigate the power spectra of cellular noise and how biological dynamics , for instance , conformational transitions of riboswitch , are modulated in the presence of athermal signals from other dynamic components such as motion of ribosome translocation and associated gene regulation @xcite .",

    "<S> strikingly , our molecular simulations performed under overdamped condition show that even at a high ( low ) tension that renders the hairpin ( un)folding improbable , a weak external oscillatory force at a certain frequency can synchronously enhance the transition dynamics of rna hairpin and increase the mean transition rate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the rna dynamics can still discriminate a signal with resonance frequency even when the signal is mixed among other signals with nonresonant frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our computational demonstration of thermally induced resonance in rna hairpin dynamics is a direct realization of the phenomena called stochastic resonance ( sr ) and resonant activation ( ra ) . </S>",
    "<S> our study , amenable to experimental tests using optical tweezers , is of great significance to the folding of biopolymers in vivo that are subject to the broad spectrum of cellular noises .            </S>",
    "<S> the cell is a highly crowded and dynamic place with millions of biomolecules and their interactions @xcite . only recently </S>",
    "<S> the notion that the self - assembly and function of biomolecules in vivo could be very different from those in isolation has been highlighted in terms of macromolecular crowding and confinement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the implication from dynamics in vivo should not necessarily be limited to the confinement or crowding effect . besides the thermal noise , which is essential for activated internal motions and folding dynamics of biomolecules , of particular note are the nonequilibrium athermal signals produced from a plethora of active processes and collective actions among cellular constituents . </S>",
    "<S> for example , ribosome translocate along mrna strand less than every 0.1 s per codon @xcite ; molecular motor , kinesin , takes step along the microtubule approximately every @xmath0 ms @xcite ; collective beating of cilia occurs approximately every @xmath1 min @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how these nonequilibrium signals or noises affect fundamental processes in biology , particularly the folding dynamics of biopolymers @xcite , is the main concern of this paper . to address this issue </S>",
    "<S> , we study the effect of a weak oscillatory force on the transition dynamics of stretched rna hairpins as a test case .    in recent years a combination of experiments , theoretical arguments and simulations have been used to extensively study the conformational dynamics of biopolymers under mechanical control @xcite . among others , </S>",
    "<S> paramount precision of optical tweezers , which can both exert piconewton force to molecules and probe structural changes in nm scale , not only allowed us to quantify thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the molecule at single molecule level @xcite , but also provided unprecedented chances to manipulate the process of life @xcite . to emulate nonequilibrium athermal noise in vivo and </S>",
    "<S> study its effect on the conformational dynamics of biopolymers , high precision force instruments seem to hold good promise ; yet , no experiment to date has explored this issue .    </S>",
    "<S> given that the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids occur at overdamped fluctuating media , it may be surprising to learn that conformational transitions of biopolymers could become enhanced or synchronized to an externally exerted weak oscillatory signal . </S>",
    "<S> however , according to the notion of stochastic resonance ( sr ) , sensitivity of a system to external signal can be improved under thermal fluctuation , so that the system can discriminate the weak information carrying signals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , it has been shown for a single brownian particle in a bistable potential that synchronization of barrier crossing events to an externally driven oscillation occurs not only at an optimal noise strength but also at resonance frequency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at another oscillation frequency that differs from the frequency of synchronization , the mean first passage time over the barrier is minimized , which is called the resonant activation ( ra ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is possible to demonstrate the sr and ra in the conformational transition dynamics of biopolymers like rna hairpins , whose folding landscape is bistable near transition mid - force , by properly tuning the frequency of additive oscillatory force .    since the pioneering work of benzi _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there have been efforts to extend the idea of sr to a vast range of physical and biological phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , sr often mentioned in terms of macroscopic systems such as recurrence of the ice age cycle and sensory systems for higher order organisms , especially the latter of which is wired with complex biochemical networks , is always a subject of debate because the inherent complexity of a system consisting of a formidable number of variables often makes the origin of such resonance - like phenomena inconclusive . </S>",
    "<S> although phenomenological modeling of system dynamics using sr is still possible , there seems to be little convincing proof that the biological systems actually use sr in the cellular level @xcite . in this aspect , </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical demonstrations of sr and ra of a polymer chain in a confined space has more direct relevance to the biology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that sr and ra can indeed be manifested in self - organization process of biopolymers by using molecular simulation . </S>",
    "<S> although careful investigation is further required to confirm whether the sr and ra are actively utilized in the cell for its biological functions , it should be straightforward to demonstrate sr in the folding and unfolding dynamics of biopolymers by using single molecule force experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple experimental protocol for the demonstration . </S>"
