    "the relative abundances of carbon and oxygen in the star determine the chemical composition of the gas and dust in the outflows .",
    "oxygen - rich stars produce silicate dust and molecules such as h@xmath5o and oh . if the mass - loss rate is sufficiently high , the dust completely obscures the star at visible wavelengths , and the object is known as an oh / ir star because of its strong emission in the infrared ( ir ) , produced by the dust grains , and in radio oh lines , due to maser action by oh molecules .",
    "see habing ( @xcite ) for a detailed review of agb and oh / ir stars .",
    "the optically - thick dust envelopes of oh / ir stars may be the result of a recent increase in mass - loss rate : the so - called ` superwind ' phase ( e.g. justtanont et al .",

    "an important result from the infrared space observatory ( iso ) mission is the detection of emission from crystalline silicates in the far - ir spectra of many sources , including the circumstellar environments of young and evolved stars and solar - system comets ( e.g. waters et al .",

    "crystalline silicate bands have been detected in oh / ir star spectra ( cami et al .",
    "@xcite ) but are not seen in o - rich agb stars with low mass - loss rates , suggesting that the abundance of the crystalline materials is related to the density of the circumstellar matter at the dust condensation radius ( waters et al .",
    "iso has also detected thermal emission and absorption by water , in both the gaseous and solid ( ice ) phases ( e.g. barlow @xcite ) , from o - rich circumstellar environments .    in this paper",
    "we present iso spectra of seven well - known oh / ir stars covering a range of mass - loss rates .",
    "the spectrum of the archetypal mira variable , @xmath6  cet , is presented for comparison . for most of our targets ,",
    "the spectra cover the complete 2.4197@xmath0 m spectral range of iso .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the lower mass - loss rate objects , strong emission features due to amorphous silicates are present , but there are no obvious narrow features at @xmath7 @xmath0 m . for the redder objects , we find that the amorphous silicates features are , and that some structure is apparent at wavelengths @xmath7 @xmath0 m .",
    "these narrow features can be identified as crystalline silicates , both olivines and pyroxenes ( waters et al .",
    "the identifications are based on laboratory spectra of crystalline silicates ( jger et al .",
    "@xcite ; koike et al .",
    "@xcite , koike & shibai @xcite ) and similar bands seen in other objects on which detailed studies have been performed , i.e.  afgl  4106 ( molster et al .",
    "@xcite ) and to hd  45677 ( voors @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ ovcrystal ] represent the position of some important crystalline silicate complexes , which are listed in table  [ xtab ] .",
    "these crystalline silicate features are found in emission at the longest wavelengths but sometimes in absorption at somewhat shorter wavelengths , for example the 23.6  @xmath0 m olivine feature in oh32.8 and in oh26.5 ( see fig .  [ ovcrystal ] ) . the oh / ir stars presented here are the only objects known to exhibit crystalline silicates in absorption outside the 8 - 13 @xmath0 m wavelength region . for oh32.8",
    "this was already reported by waters & molster ( @xcite ) in comparison with afgl  4106 .",
    "the presence of the most important crystalline silicate features is indicated in table [ xtab ] for all the sources in our sample .",
    "note that those features are detected by close examination of the spectrum ; not all features are visible in the overview figures presented in this paper .",
    "detailed modelling of the wealth of crystalline silicate features shown by the individual objects is deferred to a future paper .",
    "the crystalline silicate features tend to appear in those sources having greater optical depth at 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , the sharpness of the crystalline silicate features shows a large variation .",
    "the sharpness is expected to be determined by properties of the crystalline silicates , such as the presence of impurities , the shape of the dust grains , and irregularities in the lattice structure .",
    "the spectrum of afgl  5379 does not show the sharp crystalline peaks found in the spectra of the other oh / ir stars and in the spectra of afgl  4106 and hd  45677 , but the shapes of its features do resemble the laboratory spectra of crystalline silicates ( jger et al .",
    "this suggests that the dust grains around these objects exhibit differences in the properties of the lattice structure , such as impurities , holes , and edge effects due to grain size .",
    "the appearance of the crystalline silicate emission features in the redder sources in our sample confirms the relationship between dust crystallinity and envelope colour temperature , and hence mass - loss rate , identified by waters et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , there seems to be a threshold value for the mass loss rate above which the crystalline silicate features appear in the spectrum .",
    "however , above this threshold value , the strength and width of the features seem to be uncorrelated to the mass loss rate .    fig .  [ oh104 ]",
    "presents a more detailed overview of the location of the crystalline silicate features . in the upper panel ,",
    "the upper spectrum is that of oh104.9 .",
    "the solid line represents the continuum fit obtained using the method described above . at longer wavelengths the spectrum shows emission features superposed on the pseudo - continuum .",
    "the 18-@xmath0 m _ absorption _ feature extends to @xmath8 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ oh104 ] clearly shows for both plots , there are crystalline _ emission _ features present within this wavelength region , in particular , the 17.520 @xmath0 m complex . for reference , the continuum - subtracted spectrum of afgl  4106 ( molster et al .",
    "@xcite ) is also plotted .",
    "the 20.6 @xmath0 m emission feature is probably related to crystalline silicates , although it is not yet identified ( molster et al .",
    "@xcite ; voors @xcite ) .",
    "these oh / ir star spectra are the first to show crystalline silicates in emission simultaneously with amorphous silicates in absorption in the same wavelength region .",
    "the presence of crystalline emission features in the spectrum of oh104.9 , at wavelengths where the amorphous dust component is still in absorption , implies that the crystalline silicate dust must have a different spatial distribution than the amorphous silicate dust .",
    "we consider two possible geometries : spherical and axi - symmetrical .    for the case of a spherically symmetric distribution , the crystalline dust can have a different radial distribution and be located further out in the envelope than the amorphous dust .",
    "the sws and lws beam sizes are much larger than the angular size of the dust shells of these oh / ir stars , so the amorphous silicate absorption can originate from the entire dust shell , while the crystalline silicate emission can arise from the cool outer layers of the dust shell , where the material is optically thin . if the crystalline silicates are located further out , we can conclude that the crystalline and amorphous dust has not formed at the same time , but that the amorphous dust annealed as it moved away from the star .",
    "this could imply that lower mass loss rate mira variables could in principle be able to form crystalline material as well , but that we can not detect it because the column densities are not high enough .",
    "however , given that higher temperatures are required for annealing amorphous silicates into crystalline silicates than are required for the formation of amorphous silicates themselves , it does seem unlikely that crystalline silicate grains could be formed further out in an outflow than amorphous silicate grains .",
    "one possibility is that some small fraction of the particles which formed in an outflow ( perhaps the smallest particles ) immediately annealed into crystalline silicates in the inner , hottest regions .",
    "the large total column density of amorphous silicate grains would lead to net absorption in the 10- and 18-um bands and thus obscure these hot crystalline silicates . when these particles are cooled while flowing outwards , the strong emission features of crystalline silicates at wavelengths longer than @xmath9  15  @xmath0 m can be seen superposed on the amorphous dust features .",
    "an alternative scenario for the observed behaviour is that oh / ir stars possess a dust disk , in addition to a more spherically symmetric outflow .",
    "two alternatives suggest themselves :    * crystalline silicates that have formed and moved out from the inner regions of the outflow produce emission bands that are seen superposed against the continuum emission and amorphous silicate features that arise from the disk .",
    "this would require that those oh / ir stars that have the largest 10-@xmath0 m amorphous silicate optical depths are the ones whose disks are seen most nearly edge - on .",
    "* the crystalline silicates are located in the disk , while the amorphous silicates are located mainly in the outflow and thus have a more spherically symmetric distribution , with the amorphous silicate absorption features arising from optically thick lines of sight towards the central star . depending on the inclination angle of the system , the crystalline silicate features can be seen in emission . when the disk is viewed face - on , the crystalline silicate features would be optically thin .",
    "radiation from most of the disk surface reaches the observer via lines of sight which pass through only the outer regions of the spherical dust shell , where the amorphous material is not optically thick .",
    "two mechanisms can be invoked to explain the high abundance of crystalline silicates in a disk .",
    "below the so - called glass temperature , only amorphous silicates condense , while crystalline silicates can form at temperatures greater than the glass temperature . at the high densities occurring in a disk ,",
    "condensation of silicates will be able to proceed at higher temperatures than usual ( gail & sedlmayr @xcite ) and the temperature range in which it is possible to condense crystalline silicates is thus broadened . in our current sample",
    "there is empirical evidence for a correlation between crystallinity and density .",
    "second , if there is amorphous material present in the disk , this can be transformed into crystalline material by annealing . in order to allow the annealing process of the silicates to proceed ,",
    "the dust - forming region should not cool too rapidly .",
    "an orbiting ( or slowly outflowing ) disk provides the required stability and keeps the amorphous silicates relatively close to the central star for a sufficiently long time for the annealing into crystalline material to occur .",
    "both the above mechanisms provide circumstances that allow the formation of crystalline silicates , which would not be the case if the stellar wind removes the newly - formed silicates at the outflow velocity , such that they rapidly cool .    in order to study the spatial distribution of both dust components in more detail , spectral mapping of the oh / ir stars",
    "is necessary .",
    "then we may be able to put constraints on the spatial distribution , and determine the annealing time , of the crystalline dust , using travel time and stability arguments .",
    "using laboratory data on annealing time scales , we may be able to determine physical parameters such as temperature and density in the circumstellar dust shell , thus helping to clarify the agb mass loss phase of stellar evolution .",
    "recent high - resolution imaging of the dust around evolved stars , such as mira ( lopez et al .",
    "@xcite ) and vy  cma ( monnier et al .",
    "@xcite ) , has shown that substantial inhomogeneities exist in the dusty outflows ; our spectra suggest that the dust around oh / ir stars may also show complex morphologies .    for any geometry of the circumstellar shell , the amorphous  crystalline volume ratio could also be affected by grain - grain collisions .",
    "such collisions have long been recognised as important processes for the evolution of grains in circumstellar envelopes ( see e.g.  biermann & harwit @xcite ) and in the interstellar medium ( jones et al .",
    "the shock wave driven into the two grains by the collision can lead to vaporization , the formation of high pressure phases , melting , annealing , and shattering depending on the pressures involved ( cf .",
    ", tielens et al .",
    "experiments show that at a relative collision velocity of , mechanical effects ( shattering , crater formation ) become important .",
    "thermal effects such as crystallization , involving the intergranular nucleation of new , strain  free grains in a previously highly deformed matrix start at somewhat higher velocities (; 700 kbar ) and are never very pervasive . above ( 1 mbar ) , melting followed by rapid quenching leads to glass formation ( bauer @xcite ; schaal et al .",
    "thus , these experiments imply that crystallization only occurs over a very narrow collision velocity range and is not very efficient . of course",
    ", if the projectile / target size ratio is large , even high velocity impacts will lead to a small volume fraction of the target grain passing through the regime where recrystallization can occur when the shock wave expands .",
    "given the grain velocity profile in agb outflows ( habing et al .",
    "@xcite ) , potentially crystallizing grain - grain collisions will be largely confined to the acceleration zone at the base of the flow .",
    "an important objection against annealing through grain - grain collisions is that the cooling time scales of dust grains are very short compared to the annealing time scales .",
    "therefore the silicate dust grains solidify in the amorphous state ( molster et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the annealing process can be described as a three dimensional random walk diffusion process on a cubic lattice ( gail @xcite ) , which provides an estimate of the annealing time scale as a function of dust temperature . at a",
    "the annealing time scale is and strongly increases for lower temperatures .",
    "the cooling time scale can be derived under the assumption that the power emitted by the dust grain is given by the planck function , modified by the planck mean of the absorption efficiency @xmath10 . by comparing the emitted power to the internal heat of",
    "the grain one finds for the cooling time scales for and for . in agreement with the experiments , only a small fraction of crystallized material is expected due to the grain - grain collisional shock loading .",
    "final assessment of the viability of this mechanism for the formation of crystalline silicates in agb outflows has to await detailed modeling of such grain - grain collisions in circumstellar outflows ( kemper et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "finally , we note that the spectrum of , which is due to a dust size distribution that is surely collisionally dominated , shows little evidence for crystalline silicates .",
    "although the 10  @xmath0 m spectrum of ( knacke et al .",
    "@xcite , aitken et al .",
    "@xcite ) may show some spectral structure resembling that of solar system comets ",
    "characteristic for silicate minerals  the longer wavelength bands so prominent in cometary spectra are completely absent in this source ( pantin et al .",
    "@xcite ) . while this may at first sight argue against this mechanism , the collisional velocities in this system may be much lower and predominantly lead to shattering .",
    "we have presented the complete sws / lws spectra for seven oxygen - rich evolved stars , together with the sws spectrum of an eighth source .",
    "for the oh / ir stars , which have optically thick dust shells , essentially all of the stellar luminosity is radiated in the wavelength region covered by iso .",
    "emission features of crystalline silicates are seen longwards of 15  @xmath0 m in the dustier objects .",
    "some of these emission features lie within the 20-@xmath0 m absorption feature of amorphous silicate , suggesting that the crystalline and amorphous components have different spatial distributions .",
    "the dust shells of these sources are sufficiently cool for abundant water ice to form , as indicated by the near - ir absorption and far - ir emission features of crystalline ice .    in a future paper ( kemper et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we will present some of the further analysis and modelling required to determine the physical conditions and processes which give rise to these very rich spectra .",
