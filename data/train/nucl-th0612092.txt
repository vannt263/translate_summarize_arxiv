    "pion reactions on few  nucleon systems provide access to various physics phenomena : deuterons can be used as effective neutron targets , null ",
    "experiments for isospin violation can be designed , and they are an important test of our understanding of the nuclear structure .",
    "what is therefore necessary is a controlled theoretical framework  a proper effective field theory needs to be constructed .",
    "a first step in this direction was taken by weinberg already in 1992 @xcite .",
    "he suggested that all that needs to be done is to convolute transition operators , calculated perturbatively in standard chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , with proper nuclear wave functions to account for the non  perturbative character of the few  nucleon systems .",
    "this procedure combines the distorted wave born approximation , used routinely in phenomenological calculations , with a systematic power counting for the production operators . within chpt",
    "this idea was already applied to a large number of reactions like @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5he@xmath6he @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath8 @xcite , where only the most recent references are given .",
    "the central concept to be used in the construction of the transition operators is that of reducibility , for it allows one to disentangle effects of the wave functions and those from the transition operators .",
    "as long as the operators are energy independent , the scheme can be applied straight forwardly  @xcite , however , as we will see below , for energy dependent interactions more care is necessary .    using standard chpt especially means to treat the nucleon as a heavy field .",
    "corrections due to the finite nucleon mass , @xmath9 , appear as contact interactions on the lagrangian level that are necessarily analytic in @xmath9 .",
    "however , some pion  few - nucleon diagrams employ few  body singularities that lead to contributions non  analytic in @xmath10 , with @xmath11 for the pion mass . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is explained how to deal with those .",
    "a problem was observed when the original scheme by weinberg was applied to the reactions @xmath12 @xcite : potentially higher order corrections turned out to be large and lead to even larger disagreement between theory and experiment . for the reaction @xmath13 one loop diagrams that in the weinberg counting appear only at nnlo where evaluated @xcite and they turned out to give even larger corrections putting into question the convergence of the whole series .",
    "however , already quite early the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite stressed that an additional new scale enters , when looking at reactions of the type @xmath14 , that needs to be accounted for in the power counting .",
    "since the two nucleons in the initial state need to have sufficiently high kinetic energy to put the pion in the final state on  shell , the initial momentum needs to be larger than @xmath15 the proper way to include this scale was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite  for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result ,",
    "pion @xmath16-waves are given by tree level diagrams up to nnlo in the modified power counting and the corresponding calculations showed satisfying agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "however , for pion @xmath17waves loops appear already at nlo . in the next section",
    "we will discuss their effect on the reaction @xmath1 near threshold . in some detail we will compare the effective field theory result to that of phenomenological calculations .    since the delta ",
    "nucleon mass difference , @xmath18 , is numerically of the order of @xmath19 , also the delta ",
    "isobar should be taken into account explicitly as a dynamical degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "we will use a scheme where @xmath20    once the reaction @xmath1 is understood within effective field theory one is in the position to also calculate the so  called dispersive and absorptive corrections to the @xmath2 scattering length .",
    "this calculation will be presented in section 3 .",
    "we close with a brief summary and outlook .",
    "the tree level amplitudes that contribute to @xmath21 are shown in fig .",
    "[ tree ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite all nlo contributions of loops that start to contribute and @xmath19  loops no longer contribute at a single order but in addition to all orders higher than where they start to contribute .",
    "] to @xmath12 at nlo were calculated in threshold kinematics  that is neglecting the distortions from the @xmath22 final and initial state interaction and putting all final states at rest . at threshold",
    "only two amplitudes contribute , namely the one with the nucleon pair in the final and initial state in isospin 1 ( measured , e.g. , in @xmath13 ) and the one where the total @xmath22 isospin is changed from 1 to 0 ( measured , e.g. , in @xmath21 ) isospin is changed from 0 to 1 in the production process and that can be extracted from @xmath23 , vanishes at threshold as a consequence of selection rules . ] .",
    "it was found that the sum of all loops that contain delta  excitations vanish in both channels .",
    "this was understood , since the loops were divergent and at nlo no counter term is allowed by chiral symmetry . on the other hand the nucleonic loops were individually finite .",
    "it was found that the sum of all nucleonic loops that contribute to @xmath13 vanish , whereas the sum of those that contribute to @xmath21 gives a finite answer .",
    "the resulting amplitude grows linear with the initial momentum .    at that time it appeared as a puzzle why the loops vanished for the reaction @xmath13",
    " no obvious symmetry reason could be identified . however , in ref .  @xcite it was pointed out that the linear growth of the amplitude for the charged pion production is the problematic one : when evaluated for finite outgoing @xmath22 momenta , the transition amplitudes turned out to scale as the momentum transfer .",
    "especially , the amplitudes then grow linearly with the external @xmath22 momenta . as a consequence , once convoluted with the @xmath22 wavefunctions , a large sensitivity to those was found , in conflict with general requirements from field theory . in light of these insights",
    "it was acknowledged that the loops for @xmath21 where the ones not understood .",
    "the solution to this puzzle was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be reported now .",
    "the observation central to the analysis is that the leading @xmath24 transition vertex , as it appears in fig .",
    "[ tree]@xmath25 , is energy dependent . using the notation of fig .",
    "[ vpipinn ] its momentum and energy dependent part may be written as vertex from @xmath26 as well as its recoil correction from @xmath27 are to be used already at leading order as a consequence of the modified power counting . ] @xmath28 for simplicity we skipped the isospin part of the amplitude .",
    "the first term in the last line denotes the transition in on  shell kinematics , the second the inverse of the outgoing nucleon propagator and third the inverse of the incoming nucleon propagator .",
    "first of all we observe that for on  shell incoming and outgoing nucleons , the @xmath29 transition vertex takes its on  shell value @xmath30  even if the incoming pion is off  shell , as it is for diagram @xmath25 of fig .",
    "this is in contrast to standard phenomenological treatments@xcite , where @xmath31 was identified with @xmath32  the energy transfer in on  shell kinematics  and the recoil terms were not considered .",
    "note , since @xmath33 the recoil terms are to be kept .",
    "the second consequence of eq . ( [ pipivert ] ) is even more interesting : when the @xmath29 vertex gets convoluted with @xmath22 wave functions , only the first term leads to a reducible diagram . the second and third term , however ,",
    "lead to irreducible contributions , since one of the nucleon propagators gets canceled .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ irred ] , where those induced topologies are shown that appear , when one of the nucleon propagators is canceled ( marked by the filled box ) in the convolution of typical diagrams of the @xmath22 potential with the @xmath12 transition operator .",
    "power counting gives that diagrams @xmath34 and @xmath35 appear only at order n@xmath36lo and n@xmath37lo , respectively .",
    "however , diagram @xmath25 starts to contribute at nlo and it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that those induced irreducible contributions cancel the finite remainder of the nlo loops in the @xmath21 channel .",
    "thus , up to nlo only the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ tree ] contribute to @xmath38 , with the rule that the @xmath29 vertex is put on  shell .",
    "the result found in ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ nnpi_result ] , where the total cross section ( divided by the energy dependence of phase space ) is plotted against the normalized pion momentum .",
    "the dashed line is the result of the model by koltun and reitan  @xcite , as described above , whereas the solid line shows the result of the chpt calculation of ref .",
    "phenomenological calculations for the reaction @xmath21 in near threshold kinematics are given , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .  @xcite . in both works",
    "in addition to the diagrams of ref.@xcite some delta  loops as well as short range contributions are included  heavy meson exchanges for the former and off ",
    "shell @xmath39 scattering for the latter . based on this the cross section for @xmath21 is now even overestimated near threshold .",
    "how can we interpret this discrepancy in light of the discussion above ?",
    "first of all , the nlo parts of the delta  loops cancel , as was shown already in ref .",
    "however , in both refs .",
    "@xcite only one of these diagrams was included and , especially for ref .",
    "@xcite , gave a significant contribution .",
    "the only diagram of those nlo loops shown in fig .",
    "[ nlodiags ] that is effectively included in ref .",
    "@xcite is the fourth , since the pion loop there can be regarded as part of the @xmath29 transition @xmath40matrix .",
    "however , as described , the contribution of this diagram gets canceled by the others shown in fig .",
    "[ nlodiags ] and the induced irreducible pieces described above .",
    "therefore , the physics that enhances the cross section compared to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite in refs .",
    "@xcite is completely different to that of ref .",
    "@xcite  the phenomenological calculations miss the essential contribution and are in conflict with both field theoretic consistency and chiral symmetry .",
    "what are the observable consequences of the difference between the chpt calculation and the phenomenological ones ?",
    "as explained , in the former the near threshold cross section for @xmath21 is basically given by a long  ranged pion exchange diagram , whereas the latter rely on short ranged operators with respect to the @xmath22 system .",
    "obviously those observables are sensitive to this difference that get prominent contributions from higher partial waves in the final @xmath22 system .",
    "we therefore need to look at the reaction @xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately , the total cross section for this reaction is largely saturated by @xmath22 @xmath42waves in the final state ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "17 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , linear combinations of double polarization",
    "observables allow one to remove the prominent components and the subleading amplitudes should be visible .",
    "we therefore expect from the above considerations that the phenomenological calculations give good results for polarization observables for @xmath21 , whereas there should be deviations for some of those for @xmath41 .",
    "predictions for these observables were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and indeed the @xmath43 observables with the deuteron in the final state are described well whereas there are discrepancies for the @xmath44 final state ( see fig .",
    "24 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it remains to be seen how well the same data can be described in the effective field theory framework .",
    "up to nnlo the number of counter terms is quite low : there are two counter terms for pion @xmath17waves , that can be arranged to contribute to @xmath13 and @xmath21 individually , and then there is one counter term for pion @xmath16waves , that contributes only to a small amplitude in charged pion production  @xcite . on the other hand there is a huge amount of even double polarized data available  @xcite  and there is more to come especially for @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 scattering length is known to a high accuracy from measurements on pionic deuterium @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath11 denotes the mass of the charged pion . in the near future a new measurement with a projected total uncertainty of 0.5% for the real part and 4% for the imaginary part of the scattering length",
    "will be performed at psi @xcite .",
    "what is striking with this result is the quite large imaginary part that may be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the relative momentum of the initial @xmath2 pair .",
    "the ratio @xmath49 was measured to be @xmath50 @xcite . at low energies diagrams that lead to a sizable imaginary part of some amplitude",
    "are expected to also contribute significantly to its real part .",
    "those contributions are called dispersive corrections . as a first estimate brckner speculated that the real and imaginary part of these contributions should be of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this expectation was confirmed within faddeev calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite . given the high accuracy of the measurement and the size of the imaginary part of the scattering length , another critical look at this result is called for as already stressed in refs .",
    "a consistent calculation is only possible within a well defined effective field theory  the first calculation of this kind was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and is briefly sketched here .    to identify the diagrams that are to contribute we first need to specify what we mean by a dispersive correction .",
    "we define dispersive corrections as contributions from diagrams with an intermediate state that contains only nucleons , photons and at most real pions . therefore , all the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ disp ] are included in our work .",
    "on the other hand , all diagrams that , e.g. , have delta excitations in the intermediate state do not qualify as dispersive corrections , although they might give significant contributions  @xcite .    the hatched blocks in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ disp ] refer to the relevant transition operators for the reaction @xmath12 depicted in fig .  [ tree ] .",
    "also in the kinematics of relevance here the @xmath29 transitions are to be taken with their on  shell value @xmath30 . using the cd  bonn potential  @xcite for the @xmath22 distortions we found for the dispersive correction from the purely hadronic transition @xmath51 where the numbers in the first bracket are the individual results for the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ disp ] , in order .",
    "there are two points important to stress , first of all the inclusion of the intermediate @xmath22 interaction is necessary ( and required based on power ",
    "counting ) and the crossed diagrams ( diagram @xmath35 and @xmath52 ) give a numerically significant contribution .",
    "the latter finding might come as a surprise on the first glance , however , please recall that in the chiral limit all four diagrams of fig .",
    "[ disp ] are kinematically identical and chiral perturbation theory is a systematic expansion around exactly this point .",
    "thus , as a result we find that the dispersive corrections to the @xmath2 scattering length are of the order of 6 % of the real part of the scattering length .",
    "note that the same calculation gave very nice agreement for the corresponding imaginary part  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite also the electro ",
    "magnetic contribution to the dispersive correction was calculated .",
    "it turned out that the contribution to the real part was tiny  @xmath53  while the sizable experimental value for the imaginary part ( c.f .",
    "( [ exp ] ) and [ opttheo ] ) was described well .    to get",
    "a reliable estimate of the uncertainty of the calculation just presented a nnlo calculation is necessary . at that order",
    "two counter terms appear for pions at rest that can be fixed from @xmath12 , as indicated above .",
    "for now we need to do a conservative estimate for the uncertainty by using the uncertainty of order @xmath54 one has for , e.g. , the sum of all direct diagrams to derive a @xmath55 of around @xmath56 , which corresponds to about 6% of @xmath57 .",
    "however , given that the operators that contribute to both direct and crossed diagrams are almost the same and that part of the mentioned cancellations is a direct consequence of kinematics , this number for @xmath58 is probably too large .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed comparison to previous works is given .",
    "differences in the values found for the dispersive corrections were traced to the incomplete sets of diagrams included .",
    "the process @xmath12 is a puzzle already since more than a decade . given the progress presented above we have now reason to believe that this puzzle will be solved soon .",
    "this mentioned results could only be found , because a consistent effective field theory was used .",
    "for example , the potential problem with the transition operators of ref .",
    "@xcite , pointed at in ref .",
    "@xcite , would always be hidden in phenomenological calculations , since the form factors routinely used there always lead to finite , well behaved amplitudes . the very large number of observables available for the reactions @xmath12 will provide a non  trivial test to the approach described .",
    "once the scheme is established , the same field theory can be used to analyze the isospin violating observables measured in @xmath59  @xcite and @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "first steps in this direction were already done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the former and in refs .",
    "@xcite for the latter .    based on the calculation for @xmath21",
    "we also performed a calculation for the dispersive and absorptive corrections to the @xmath2 scattering length that were calculated for the first time within chpt .",
    "the final answer turned out to be relatively small as a consequence of cancellations amongst various terms .",
    "this work is an important step forward towards a high accuracy calculation for the @xmath2 scattering length that will eventually allow for a reliable extraction of the isoscalar scattering length .",
    "however , before this can be done , isospin violating corrections  @xcite as well as the contributions from the delta  isobar need to be evaluated .",
