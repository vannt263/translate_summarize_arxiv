    "deep in the heart of northern england , on the banks of a river near a village at the edge of the lancashire pennines , there is a fine brick building dating from the late nineteenth century . here",
    "dwell two stout , well - preserved old ladies named victoria and alexandra",
    ". they will never invite you in for tea though , for the building is the ellenroad mill engine house and the two ladies are a giant , twin compound steam engine operating in tandem , originally built in 1892 . on weekends willing teams of overalled maids and butlers oil and polish the ladies and fire up the old lancashire boiler that delivers the steam to their cylinders to move the pistons that drive the giant , 80-ton flywheel .",
    "the speed of the engines is controlled by a centrifugal governor , and the motions of this device , occurring on time and spatial scales that can be appreciated by the human visual cortex , are fascinating to watch . originally patented by james watt in 1789 , the centrifugal steam engine governor is the most celebrated prototype example of a self - regulating feedback mechanism .",
    "the device consists of two steel balls hinged on a rotating shaft which is spun from a belt or gears connected to the flywheel , figure [ governor - sketch ] . in stable operation , as the speed of the engine increases the inertia of the flyballs swings the arms outwards , contracting the aperture of a valve which controls the speed of rotation by restricting the steam supply .",
    "if the engine lags due to an additional , imprecisely known , load ( in the mill this might have been another loom connected up to the engine by a belt drive ) the flyballs are lowered and the valve opens , increasing the steam supply to compensate .",
    "thus the design of the governor cleverly uses the disturbance itself , or deviation from set - point or desired performance , to actuate the restoring force .    in certain operating regimes",
    "the motions of the governor may lose stability , becoming oscillatory and spasmodic , amplifying the effect of the disturbance and thwarting control of the engine .",
    "nineteenth century engineers called this unstable behaviour _ hunting _ and devoted much effort to improving the design of centrifugal governors .",
    "james clarke maxwell was the first to formulate and analyse the stability of the equations of motion of the governor , explaining the onset of hunting behaviour in mathematical terms  @xcite , followed ( independently ) by vyshnegradskii@xcite .",
    "we analyse vyshnegradskii s equations for the governor s motion in section [ sec3 ] , as an exemplary three dimensional stability problem .",
    "the self - correcting centrifugal governor is a simple feedback control system because the changes in velocity are fed back to the steam valve .",
    "its widespread adoption during the 18th and 19th centuries dramatically transformed the steam - driven textile mills , the mining industry , and locomotion .",
    "( in 1868 , the year maxwell published `` on governors''@xcite there were an estimated 75,000 watt governors in england alone@xcite . ) without this device the incipient industrial revolution could not have progressed , because steam engines lacking self - control would have remained hopelessly inefficient , monstrous , contraptions , requiring more than the labour that they replaced to control them .",
    "watt s iconic governor also embodies a radical change in the philosophy of science . for several hundred years",
    "the mechanical clock , with its precise gears and necessity for human intervention to rewind it or correct error and its complete absence of closed - loop feedback , had been the dominant motif in scientific culture . in a common metaphor ,",
    "the universe was created and ordered by god the clockmaker .",
    "isaac newton had no doubt that god had initiated the celestial mechanics of the motions of the planets and intervened when necessary to keep his creation perfectly adjusted and on track@xcite .",
    "the clockwork view was also deeply satisfying to laplace , one of the most influential mathematicians of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .",
    "stability theory was developed some two centuries and more after newton published his _ principia _ ( 1687 ) , so he could not have known that the planetary orbits may be what poincar called poisson stable@xcite ( small perturbations are self - correcting )  or they may be chaotic .    as concepts of feedback and stability were developed rigorously and applied in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , divine open - loop control began to wane and there came a growing awareness of systems as dynamical entities that can regulate their own destiny and internally convert uncertain inputs into stable outputs .",
    "the technological advances in transport , power , and communications made possible by feedback control and applied stability theory are agents of change , the vectors of liberty , liberalism , and literacy in societies , themselves enabling the blossoming and seeding of more sophisticated ideas of feedback and stability in complex environmental , socio - economic , and biological systems .",
    "_ now , _ due to stability theory and feedback control , we may contemplate `` the fundamental interconnectedness of all things''@xcite , but back _ then , _ in the clockwork days , people could not .",
    "it is surely no coincidence that totalitarian governments favour clockwork metaphors .",
    "control theory , then , is a major strand in the development of modern nonlinear dynamics , but it is not the first .",
    "the centrifugal governor also transformed the practice of astronomy , in that it enabled fine control of telescope drives and vastly improved quantitative observations , and it is this earlier force ( already alluded to above in mention of newton s and laplace s work ) in the development of dynamical systems and stability theory  celestial mechanics  on which we now focus attention .",
    "the next stage of our nonlinear dynamics odyssey takes us from the post - industrial north of england to the miraculously intact ( given the destructions of wwii ) medieval city of regensburg in germany , to an older , humbler but no less important building than that which houses the ladies , the kepler museum .",
    "in addition to celebrating the life and work of johannes kepler ( 15711630 ) the museum houses priceless manuscripts , letters , publications , and astronomical instruments and interpretive exhibits that tell a lively and inspiring story , that of the development of celestial mechanics from galileo to its culmination , in analytic terms , in the work of poincar .",
    "an exhibit from the 18th century , an exquisitely engineered brass orrery , or clockwork model of the solar system , in its detail and precision expresses the satisfaction and confidence of the clockwork aficionados of the age of enlightenment .",
    "but a nearby exhibit expresses , rather presciently , the need for a new metaphor for scientific endeavour and achievement .",
    "it is an early 19th century relief in which kepler unveils the face of urania , the muse of astronomy , whereupon she insouciantly hands him a telescope and a scroll inscribed with his own laws , as if to say : `` hmm  not a bad job ; now take these back and do some more work then tell me why your elliptical orbits are non - generic '' .",
    "( see figure  [ kepler ] . )      despite laplace s confidence the problem of the stability of the solar system refused to go away , but instead took on a central role in the preoccupations of mathematicians , physicists , astronomers , and navigators post - newton .",
    "it was by no means clear , even to newton , that newton s law was sufficient to describe the motions of three or more celestial bodies under mutual gravitational attraction .",
    "the problem also refused to be solved , in the sense of what was accepted as a `` solution '' during the latter 18th century and first half of the 19th century , i.e. , analytically in terms of elementary or previously - known special functions .",
    "progress was made in the mid-1800s in improving series approximations but , not surprisingly , the hydra of nonconvergence soon raised one after the other of its ugly ( of course ! ) heads . by 1885 , when it was chosen by weierstrass as one of four problems in the mathematics competition sponsored by king oscar ii of sweden , the @xmath1-body problem had achieved notoriety for its recalcitrance  but in doing so it had also driven many of the seminal advances in mathematics and produced many of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century .",
    "the first problem in king oscar s competition was to show that the solar system as modeled by newton s equations is stable . in his ( corrected ) entry@xcite poincar invented or substantially extended integral invariants , characteristic exponents , and * poincar maps * ( obviously ) , invented and proved the * recurrence theorem * , proved the nonexistence of uniform first integrals of the three body problem , other than the known ones , discovered * asymptotic solutions * and * homoclinic points * , and wrote the first ever description of chaotic motion  in short , founded and developed the entire subject of geometric and qualitative analysis . then he concluded by saying he regarded his work as only a preliminary survey from which he hoped future progress would result .",
    "poincar s `` preliminary survey '' is still inspiring new mathematics and applications , but during the 20th century the collective dynamic of dynamical systems development was highly nonlinear .",
    "homoclinic points and homoclinic chaos were partially treated by the american mathematician george birkhoff ( 18841944 )  he obtained rigorous results on the existence of periodic orbits _ near _ a homoclinic orbit  and by cartwright and littlewood in their study of van der pol s ( non - hamiltonian ) equation@xcite , @xmath2 cartwright and littlewood stated numerous `` bizarre '' properties of solutions of this differential equation , implying the existence of an invariant cantor set , but their very concise paper was not easy to penetrate , and their results remained largely unknown until levinson@xcite pointed them out to stephen smale .    during the 1960s and 1970s smale s representation of homoclinic chaos in terms of symbolic dynamics and the horseshoe map@xcite stimulated renewed interest in dynamical systems ( although we have skipped a lot of mathematical history here , most notably kam theory ) .",
    "happily , this coincided with the advent of desktop digital computers subject to moore s law .",
    "since the 1980s improvements in processor speed have both driven and been driven by the use of computational simulations of dynamical systems as virtual experiments , and inspired advances in fields such as network stability , numerical instabilities , and turbulence .",
    "essentially these advances are sophisticated and technologically facilitated applications of poincar s and lyapunov s stability theory , and in the next section we present the basics and some working definitions .",
    "it is somewhat ironic that improvements in processor speed have also led to renewed interest in low dimensional dynamical systems , which usually only require small - time computing and are at least partially amenable to rigorous stability analysis . for large dynamical systems",
    "usually mean turbulent ones , and computation is , in essence , the notorious `` problem of turbulence '' . in a turbulent flow energy",
    "is distributed among wavenumbers that range over perhaps seven orders of magnitude ( for , say , a tokamak ) to twelve orders of magnitude ( for a really huge system , say a supernova ) . to simulate a turbulent flow in the computer",
    "it is necessary to resolve all relevant scales of motion in three dimensions .",
    "it is a fair estimate@xcite that such calculations would take 400 years at today s processor speeds , therefore a faster way to do them would be to rely on moore s law and wait only 20 years until computers are speedy enough .",
    "many of us in the turbulence business have realized that while we are waiting we can , more expediently , apply reduced dynamical systems methods to the problem , such as karhunen - love ( kl ) decomposition , to distill out a much - reduced , but nevertheless sophisticated , approximation to the dynamics and spatial structure of a turbulent flow@xcite .",
    "to introduce kl decomposition , we imagine a fractional distillation tower for which the feedstock is not crude oil but a high reynolds number flow . then instead of a natural distribution over hydrocarbon molecular weights we have an energy distribution over scales of motion .",
    "we know , in principle , how hydrocarbons are separated in the still according to their boiling points ( even if we do not work at an oil refinery ) , but what properties may we exploit to separate and re - form the energy components of a turbulent flow ? our turbulence refinery does not define the skyline of a seamy port city in complicated chiaroscuro , but exists more conveniently in constrained fluid flow experiments or as direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations _ in silico_. the kl transform operates on data to yield eigenfunctions that capture in decreasing order most of the kinetic energy of the system , so it is especially useful for highly self - structured flows .",
    "+          very few dynamical systems have known , exact solutions .",
    "for the vast majority it can not even be proved that general solutions exist .",
    "stability theory is quite indifferent to such issues ; instead it tells us how families of solutions would behave , assuming they _ do _ exist .",
    "loosely we understand stability to mean that a solution does not run away , or to refer to the resilience of a solution to changes in initial conditions or to changes to the equation that generates it .",
    "stability is a qualitative property of dynamical equations and their solutions .    for practical applications",
    "stability analysis allows us to say whether a given system configuration will exhibit runaway dynamics ( catastrophic failure ) or return to a stable quasi - equilibrium , limit cycle , or other attractor , in response to perturbation .",
    "we have indicated in section [ introduction ] above how the issue of stability of the planetary orbits drove the development of celestial mechanics , but stability is equally important in control theory  from a design and operational point of view it could be said that control _ is _ applied stability . it is a grave issue because , as we show in section [ sec3 ] , feedback can result in systems that fail due to instabilities , as well as create ones which maintain homeostasis .",
    "thermal explosions , ecological `` arms races '' , and economic depressions are all more - or - less disastrous consequences of unstable feedback dynamics . a big stability question that occupies many scientists today concerns the long - term stability of the world s climate in response to the enhanced greenhouse effect ; questions related to stability of other complex systems will be explored in section [ sec6 ] .    in this section",
    "we give precise mathematical expression to these concepts of stability , for later reference . for more detail and discussion the reader",
    "is referred to the article in scholarpedia curated by holmes and shea - brown@xcite .",
    "consider the general dynamical system in vector form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and the derivatives @xmath5 are defined and continuous on a domain @xmath6 of the space of @xmath7 .",

    "these general definitions of lyapunov stability and asymptotic stability are indifferent to the choice of initial values @xmath26 .",

    "notice that @xmath32 need not approach @xmath29 .",
    "lyapunov stability means that when all orbits starting from a small neighbourhood of a solution remain forever in a small neighborhood of that solution the motion is stable , otherwise it is unstable .",

    "an asymptotically stable equilibrium ( stationary state ) and its local environment is sketched in figure [ a - equil - stability ] .",
    "it is all very well to settle the stability properties of a solution , but what then ?",
    "if , as is usually the case , we are studying eq .",
    "[ general ] as a model for coupled physical motions or a system of rate processes , and therefore necessarily imperfect , we also need information about how those properties fare under perturbations to the model , or _ structural stability_. the question usually goes something like this : when are sufficiently small perturbations of a dynamical system equivalent to the original unperturbed dynamical system ? and",
    "if a system is not structurally stable , how may one unfold it until it is ? and",
    "what ( new mathematics , physics ) do the unfoldings reveal ?",
    "the concept of structural stability has yielded a rich taxonomy of bifurcations and of different classes of vector fields .",
    "structural stability is thus fundamentally a classification science , a binomial key of the type that has been used in biology since the method was devised by the swedish botanist linnaeus ( 1707-1778 ) .",
    "it is more distracting than useful to define structural stability rigorously at this stage ( although authoritative definitions can be found in the literature , e.g. , hirsch and smale ( 1974)@xcite ) ; instead , we shall illustrate some of the concepts in section [ sec4 ] in relation to a perturbed simple pendulum as a simplified surrogate for the restricted three body problem .",
    "now that we have some background and theory resources to draw on , let us carry out a stability analysis of the centrifugal governor .",
    "this analysis is all the more important for being elementary because it introduces many of the key concepts of dynamical systems theory in a setting that is understandable to non - mathematician physical scientists and engineers and also sets the scene for the more complicated motions we describe in sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] .",
    "vyshnegradskii s equations of motion for the flyball governor sketched in figure [ governor - sketch ] were given as a 3-dimensional , autonomous , first - order dynamical system by pontryagin ( 1962)@xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the angle between the spindle @xmath40 and the flyball arms @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the rotational velocity of the flywheel , the transmission ratio @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the angular velocity of @xmath40 , @xmath45 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath46 is the flyball mass , @xmath47 is the moment of inertia of the flywheel , @xmath48 represents the net load on the engine , @xmath49 is a constant , and @xmath50 is a frictional coefficient . the length of the arms @xmath41 is taken as unity . for a given load @xmath48 the engine speed and fly - ball angle are required to remain constant , and the unique steady state or equilibrium coordinates are easily found as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "so far , so dull .",
    "dull , too , are the designers of engines , according to maxwell . in his treatment of the governor problem , which was more general than that of vyshnegradskii , he wrote : `` the actual motions corresponding to these impossible roots are not generally taken notice of by the inventors of such machines , who naturally confine their attention to the way in which it is _ designed _ to act ; and this is generally expressed by the real root of the equation . ''",
    "the impossible roots he referred to are the complex roots of the characteristic equation obtained from the linearized equations of motion .",
    "maxwell and vyshnegradskii both used this method to investigate the mathematical stability of the engine - governor dynamical system and relate the results closely to observed misbehaviours of the physical system .",
    "their linear stability analyses provide criteria for which the system returns to its equilibrium engine speed @xmath54 and flyball angle @xmath55 when subjected to a small perturbation .",

    "the behaviour of the system has become essentially 3-dimensional .",
    "this section assumes a working knowledge of hamiltonian mechanics from a text book such as goldstein ( 1980)@xcite or from undergraduate lecture notes such as dewar ( 2001)@xcite . rather than presume to capture the entire content and context of the restricted three body problem within the space of one chapter section we again summarize a small vignette from the panorama , a surrogate for the restricted three body problem .",

    "he also showed that the reduced system , and therefore its poincar map , possesses hyperbolic saddle points whose stable and unstable manifolds , being level sets of the second integral , coincide , as they do for the pendulum illustrated in figure [ pendulum ] .",
    "he then asked the key question in the qualitative approach to dynamical systems : should i expect this picture to persist if i restore the higher order terms ?",
    "in other words , is the reduced system structurally stable ? it is now known that integrable hamiltonian systems of two or more degrees of freedom are not structurally stable .",
    "it is for this reason , even if no other , that they are exciting and productive to study .    in this section",
    "we have described how the structural stability of a poincar map of a continuous dynamical system can be evaluated , even though in general such a map can not be computed explicitly . in the next section",

    "the function @xmath107 is chosen so that @xmath108 increases when the population is small , because there is plenty of food and living space in the box , but decreases when the population is large , because of competition for food and living space .    the simplest single - humped function for @xmath107 that one can think of is a parabola : @xmath109 for which equation [ e17 ] is known as the logistic map .",
    "the parameter @xmath110 is then the reproduction rate constant .",
    "equation [ e17 ] then says that due to reproduction the population will increase at a rate proportional to the current population , and due to starvation the population will decrease at a rate proportional to the _ square _ of the current population . for example , if there is a large number of flies in a box in one time period , they will eat most of the food , and the next generation of flies will be few in number .",

    "these new equilibria are not fixed points of @xmath107 .",
    "they are fixed points of the second composition map , @xmath120 as shown in figure [ cobweb](b ) . here",
    ", the initial condition @xmath111 is the same as in ( a ) , and the iterates at first take the population toward the old fixed point .",
    "but then they are repelled from it , because it is unstable , and converge instead to the _ two _ intersections of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , between which they oscillate in a period 2 orbit .",
    "this situation corresponds to the population @xmath106 switching between two states : a highly populated generation results in the next generation being poorly populated , but then resources are plentiful enough to induce a populous generation again , and so on",
    ".    one can not help but be curious as to what happens when the parameter  @xmath110 is increased again , and again  we could compute many more of these cobweb diagrams , each at a different value of @xmath110 , but both the diagrams and this chapter would become very crowded",
    ". our curiosity can be assuaged ( or whetted ! ) more succinctly by inspecting the bifurcation diagram of stable solutions in figure [ bd ] .",
    "one can easily make out the branch points at @xmath123 , @xmath124 corresponding to bifurcations to period 2 , 4 and 8 orbits . beyond that , the period - doubling repeats until the periodic behaviour of the population becomes chaotic .",
    "the population never settles to discernibly regular @xmath1-periodic oscillations , although the window at @xmath125 suggests the resumption of some sort of regularity .",
    "so far we have viewed the blowfly system as a difference equation , to model the generational delay , and as a bifurcation problem , to study the stability of the dynamics . picking up the theme of section [ sec3 ] , it is also instructive to view the blowfly system as a simple feedback system .    the output of the system ( number of adult blowflies )",
    "is sensed by a controller which implements a mechanism , approximated here by the model function @xmath126 to control the level of input , or number of larvae . the actuating mechanism which transforms",
    "the larvae into adult flies is simply the delay time of one generation .",
    "figure [ flies ] represents the feedback system as a block diagram .",
    "this diagram may seem rather facile , and nowhere near as interesting as the cobweb or bifurcation diagrams , but it does highlight a different side to the problem .",
    "for instance we see that the block components are independent .",
    "we could change the function @xmath112 without changing the simple delay model . inspecting this diagram",
    "also makes it easy to build in perturbations such as predation or injecting more flies from outside .    the conceptual difference between modelling the blowfly population as a difference equation and as a feedback system is how information is treated . in the block diagram representation",
    "the information flow is explicit and the feedback is obvious , and we can immediately think up ways of adding additional regulations to it . in this sense feedback is an _ information _ science .",
    "this information about connectivity is subsumed in the discrete dynamical model , which allows us to analyse the stability of the population but glosses over the fact that the instabilities are caused by feedback .",
    "the third ( and final , for this chapter ) destination in our world tour of nonlinear dynamics is the 41st floor of an office tower in the district of wan chai , hong kong .",
    "it is here that the transport operations and infrastructure of hong kong , kowloon , and the new territories ( which together constitute a special administrative region of the people s republic of china , or hksar ) are controlled and coordinated day - to - day , and planning and policy development for future transport needs are carried out .",
    "the job of the hksar department of transport is formidable .",
    "consider the problem : the public transport network carries over 11 million passenger trips _ each day _ and this number will increase .",
    "it consists of railways , franchised buses , public light buses , private buses , ferries , trams , and taxis .",
    "each of these components is a complex sub - network in its own right .",
    "the area is geographically diverse , with islands , harbour , waterways , steep hills , airport , and old built - up districts with limited road space to be traversed or accessed .",
    "environmental imperatives require the use of or conversion to low or zero emissions locomotive units .",
    "efficient integration with transport in the densely populated economic - tiger zones of the pearl river delta is becoming necessary .",
    "the network as a whole must be safe , affordable , reliable , and robust .",
    "it must minimize redundancy and duplication of services , yet be flexible enough to match new demand without undue time - lags and provide services to new and changing population and employment centres .",
    "this means it must be capable of response and adaptatation on two time scales , daily and long - term ( approximately yearly ) .",
    "what a tall order ! can one tackle this complex network problem using the tools of dynamical systems theory ?",
    "in dynamical systems language we ask : is the hksar public transport network stable ?",
    "intuitively ( or through direct experience ) we expect such a complex network to exhibit * sensitive dependence on initial conditions*. one blinking red led on a signal - room console leads to a log - jam of peak hour trains . even with no perturbations on the network itself we know ( with depressing certitude ) that leaving for work five minutes later than usual is likely to result in arriving at work an hour late .",
    "these sorts of cascade effects in networks seem to occur when a small disturbance in one element of a network is transmitted through it leading to instability as it spreads , but what lies behind these phenomena ?    studying networks such as the hksar public transport network is about building models of how they function , and then analysing those models to understand how changes in the structure of the network will result in changes in behaviour .",
    "navely , one expects that increasing the fraction of interacting elements or increasing the strength of interaction will enhance the stability of a complex network , but as we will show in the next example , that is not necessarily so .    in a paper in _ nature _ in 1972 robert may@xcite used random matrix theory to show that in a large , linear , randomly coupled network the system dimension and the coupling strength must together satisfy a simple inequality . let us revisit the matrix equation ( [ linear ] ) : @xmath127 may considered this as the linearization of a ( large ) set of nonlinear first - order differential equations that describe an ecology , or populations of @xmath1 interacting species , but it could equally well describe rates of passenger turnover at each of @xmath1 nodes in a public transport network .",
    "the elements of the @xmath128 column vector @xmath18 are the disturbed populations @xmath129 and the elements @xmath130 of the @xmath131 interaction matrix @xmath132 describe the effect of species @xmath133 on species @xmath134 near equilibrium .",
    "each @xmath130 is assigned from a distribution of random numbers that has a mean of zero , so that any element is equally likely to be positive or negative , and a mean square value @xmath135 , which expresses the average interaction strength .",
    "then @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a random matrix and @xmath71 is the unit matrix .",
    "the probability that any pair of species will interact is expressed by the connectance @xmath138 , measured as the fraction of non - zero elements in @xmath132 .",
    "the elements in the random matrix @xmath137 are drawn from the random number distribution with probability @xmath138 or are zero with probability @xmath139 .",
    "for any given system of size @xmath1 , average interaction strength @xmath135 , and connectance @xmath138 we ask what is the probability @xmath140 that any particular matrix drawn from the ensemble gives a stable system ? may found that for large @xmath1 the system ( [ linear ] ) is almost certainly stable ( @xmath141 ) if @xmath142 and almost certainly unstable ( @xmath143 ) if @xmath144 this result suggests that an ecology that is too richly connected ( large @xmath138 ) or too strongly connected ( large @xmath135 ) is likely to be unstable and that the effect is more dramatic the larger the number of species @xmath1 .    may s result is based firmly on stability theory as it was developed by poincar and lyapunov over a hundred years ago , as are more recent results on stability and control of dynamical network systems . for example ,",
    "yao _ _ et al__@xcite in proposing a control method for chaotic systems with disturbances and unknown parameters ( imprecisely modelled or unmodelled dynamics ) rely on lyapunov stability theory , as do almost all of the applications mentioned by boccaletti and pecora ( 2006)@xcite in the preface to a special issue of the journal _ chaos _ devoted to stability of complex networks .",
    "although dynamical systems and stability theory was born and bred in celestial mechanics and control engineering , we now see that the concepts and methods have much wider application in the biological and environmental sciences and in socio - economic modelling and forecasting .",
    "a goal that is shared by many researchers in both hard and soft science is the improved management , and ultimately a priori design , of complex dynamical networks that are intrinsically imprecise or error - prone . to this end",
    "there is a need to disseminate the principles of stability and chaos outside mathematics , so that non - mathematical scientists are better - equipped to understand and manage the dynamics of complex natural and anthropogenic systems , and channel uncertainty into stable output",
    ".    how will these problems , fundamental and applied , be tackled ?",
    "how will the science of dynamical systems , stability and chaos advance ?",
    "we suggest that the three main approaches will be used in synergy : qualitative and asymptotic analysis , interdisciplinary collaboration , and computation .",
    "the rapid growth of interest in dynamical systems and chaos over the past 30 years is , in a sense , quite different from the way that areas of mathematics and physics developed in earlier times .",
    "it is not driven by industrialization , as for example was thermodynamics in the 19th century and classical control in the early 20th century , or by defence and cold war imperatives , as was nuclear physics from the 1940s to the 1960s .",
    "what we are seeing now is the reverse : theory and mathematics of dynamical systems and chaos together with faster computers are actually driving developments in a wide range of very diverse fields , from medical imaging to art restoration , traffic control to ecosystems , neuroscience to climatology .",
