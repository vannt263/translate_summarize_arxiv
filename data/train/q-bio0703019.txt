    "evolutionary dynamics has proved to be a useful theory to describe evolution of biological systems at all levels of organization @xcite .",
    "rooted in the basic tenet of darwinism , the replicator dynamics @xcite of evolutionary game theory provides an elegant mathematical description of how natural selection among ( phenotypes ) strategies takes place when the reproductive success of individuals ( and then the future abundance , _ i.e. _ frequency , of strategies ) depends on the current phenotypic composition of the population ( frequency - dependent fitness ) . in this regard ,",
    "one of the current theoretical challenges to the explanatory powers of evolutionary game dynamics is the understanding of the observed evolutionary survival of cooperative behavior among individuals when selfish actions provide a higher benefit ( fitness ) . perhaps the best suited ( and most used ) model to formally describe",
    "the puzzle of how cooperation arises is the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , a two - players - two - strategies game , where each player chooses one of the two available strategies , cooperation or defection : a cooperator receives @xmath0 when playing with a cooperator , and @xmath1 when playing with a defector , while a defector earns @xmath2 when playing with a defector , and @xmath3 against a cooperator . when @xmath4 , the game is a pd . given this payoff ordering , in a well - mixed ( unstructured ) population where each agent interacts with all other agents ( or a representative sample of the population composition ) , defectors are fitter and thus the fraction of cooperators asymptotically vanishes .    among the various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how natural selection can lead to cooperative behavior ( like kin selection , group selection , direct or indirect reciprocity ) @xcite ,",
    "a simple one is based on leaving off the well - mixed population hypothesis , so that each individual only interacts with agents in its neighborhood , as specified by some graph or network of `` social '' interactions .",
    "agent - based - modelling approaches @xcite of this kind in theoretical biology @xcite , economics @xcite and social sciences @xcite often benefit in a natural way from statistical physics methods , concepts and techniques ( also scientists ) , so favoring fruitful ( synergic ) interdisciplinary ( socio- , bio- , econo- ) physics research @xcite , often termed physics of complex systems @xcite .    early pioneering numerical work",
    "@xcite on the pd game in two - dimensional square lattices , made the observation that , unlike in unstructured populations , cooperators and defectors can coexist in the lattice indefinitely .",
    "in @xcite each individual node played with its immediate neighbors each time step accumulating a payoff , then updated its strategy by imitating the one of highest payoff in its neighborhood , including itself ( best - takes - over reproduction rule ) and back again for very large times .",
    "when passing from a `` mean field '' ( well mixed population ) interaction description to a lattice structure of interactions , one has to specify various details ( of varying importance ) on both , _ a ) _ the lattice characteristics , _",
    "e.g. _ regular or not , randomness of various kinds , finite size effects , etc . , and _",
    "b ) _ the specific form of the microscopic dynamics of reproduction process , _ e.g. _ deterministic rules or probabilistic ones , synchronous or asynchronous updating , what types of stochastic fluctuations are allowed , etc .",
    "the study of many , if not most , of important aspects of the issue have generated for more than a decade a wealthy literature , of a great interest from the statistical physics perspective ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; for a recent review , see @xcite , where an extensive list of references can be found ) .",
    "nowadays , the existence of _ cooperation - promoting feedback mechanisms that are rooted deep into the interaction structure _ is indisputably accepted .",
    "it has been termed _",
    "spatial _ , or _",
    "lattice _ reciprocity , in analogy to _ direct _ reciprocity ( through iterated game strategies ) and _ indirect _ reciprocity ( through reputation , or scoring , of agents ) .",
    "simply said , the clustering of cooperators in the lattice could provide high enough fitness to the cooperator nodes exposed to invasion , to the extent of preserving cooperators from evolutionary extinction , even when defection is blatantly favored by the one - shot ( two - players ) game analysis .",
    "for negligible values of @xmath5 , when @xmath6 increases from zero cooperation decreases slowly , and becomes zero at values of @xmath7 well beyond zero .",
    "the region ( in parameter space ) of coexistence of strategists is the genuine battlefield where the competition between strategies adopts interesting , non - trivial aspects : the transition region between two clear - cut phases , _",
    "i.e. _ all - cooperators ( all - c ) prevailing at @xmath8 , and all - defectors ( all - d ) at higher values of @xmath9 .",
    "more recently , a set of works have extended this perspective to a most intriguing and ubiquitous class of networks , say scale - free networks , a `` focuss issue '' nowadays .",
    "there is an accumulated evidence that many real biological @xcite , social @xcite and technological @xcite systems are neither regular nor simplest random graphs ( not to say well - mixed populations ) of entities or agents , but they are described by some distinctive metric ( path length based ) and topological ( structure and size of local neighborhoods ) properties .",
    "they often show a so - called scale - free ( sf ) distribution density of degree , @xmath10 , where the degree @xmath11 of a node is the number of connections it shares with its neighbors @xcite , so their connectivity patterns depart considerably from lattice homogeneity ( lacking of a sharp characteristic scale of connectivity ) .",
    "the ubiquity and importance of complex networks raised quite naturally the question of how natural selection works on top of different types of complex networks of agents @xcite . in this case",
    "( as in other nonlinear dynamical processes in networks @xcite ) one has to deal with two sources of complexity , the evolutionary dynamics and the complex structure of the substrate , which are entangled .",
    "interestingly , the sort of processes that evolutionary game dynamics is aimed to model may well be very relevant to understand real networked systems through the study of a variety of scenarios of co - evolution of both strategies ( phenotype survival ) and network ( evolving topological features)@xcite . among other works exploring various aspects on the evolution in complex networks ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "from here we focuss attention on fixed network settings and how degree heterogeneity influences evolutionary dynamics of pd .    some recent extensive numerical works on pd ( and closely related ) games",
    "@xcite on sf networks , using probabilistic updating rule ( random neighbor pair - comparison , and update with probability proportional to fitness difference ) have shown that the absence of a sharp characteristic scale of degree in the network greatly enhances the `` lattice reciprocity '' mechanisms of evolutionary survival of cooperation .",
    "for example , highly connected ( hubs ) cooperator nodes have the chance of high payoffs and resist well invasion by easily invading less connected neighbors , which in turn increase hub s payoffs and invading capabilities @xcite ; this positive feedback mechanism does not operate in the case of defector hubs and illustrates in a simple way one of the biasing effects of graph heterogeneity .",
    "in a recent exploration of these heterogeneity based cooperation - promoting mechanisms , using the kind of implementation of replicator dynamics on graphs specified above in the previous paragraph , one observes generically @xcite that fixation of the cooperation ( as well as defection ) strategy on certain nodes occurs after ( often - not - large ) sensible transients , so that any asymptotic trajectory of population states defines a partition of the network into three sets : the set @xmath12 of nodes where cooperation is fixed , the set @xmath13 of nodes where defection is fixed , and the set @xmath14 of fluctuating nodes that experience forever cycles of invasion by the competing strategies .",
    "in other words , the observed stationary value of the average fraction @xmath15 of cooperators ( see definition in section 3 ) , in any asymptotic ( long - term ) trajectory , has two additive contributions : a ) the relative size @xmath16 of the set of pure cooperators , and b ) the overall fraction of time @xmath17 spent by fluctuating nodes as cooperators , weighted by its relative size @xmath18 , say    @xmath19    the analysis of global connectedness inside the sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 of fixed strategy nodes reveals that the lack of a significant characteristic scale of degree is neatly associated to a simply connected @xmath12 set , while @xmath13 is fragmented into many clusters in the wide transition region ( coexistence of strategies ) between asymptotic uniform ( @xmath20 , all - c , and @xmath21 , all - d ) equilibria .",
    "this structure of @xmath13 in the strategies coexistence regime is similar to that exhibited by both @xmath12 and @xmath13 sets for the erds - renyi random class of networks ( _ i.e. _ with poissonian distribution density of degrees , and thus a significant characteristic scale : the network average degree ) @xcite .",
    "all previous results @xcite , were obtained for a unbiased ( @xmath22 ) initial proportion of ( randomly placed ) cooperators , for all the analyzed stochastic trajectories .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in exploring the robustness of these observations reported in @xcite on the behavior of the partition sets , for a limiting one - parameter form of the pd game , say @xmath23 : the border with the snowdrift game ( see next section ) .",
    "robustness against parameter @xmath24 variation , and others , will be analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in particular , we focus here on two aspects of robustness : first , the influence of varying initial fraction of cooperators on the network partition sets ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) of asymptotic trajectories . the model ,",
    "its dynamical rules and structural characteristics , as well as the necessary technical details , are the contents of section [ model ] .",
    "the results are described and analyzed in section [ initial ] .",
    "second , in section [ heterogeneity ] , we show how those observed behaviors of the partition vary along an interpolating family of networks whose heterogeneity can be one - parametric tuned , from er limit to ba limit , that is , we check robustness against decreasing heterogeneity of the network . conclusions and some prospective remarks",
    "can be found in ending section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma game is defined in its more general form by the payoff matrix : @xmath25 where the element @xmath26 is the payoff received by an @xmath27-strategist when playing against a @xmath28-strategist , with @xmath29 meaning cooperator , and @xmath30 defector .",
    "the payoff ordering is given by @xmath4 .",
    "other payoff orderings have received other names , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath31 corresponds to the so - called snowdrift ( or hawks and doves , or chicken ) game .",
    "following several studies @xcite , the pd payoffs have been set to @xmath32 ( so the reward for cooperating fixes the payoff scale ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( no benefit under mutual defection ) , and @xmath35 .",
    "this last choice places us in the very frontier of pd game .",
    "it has the effect of not favoring any strategy when playing against defectors ( while being advantageous to play defection against cooperators ) .",
    "small positive values of the parameter @xmath36 leads to no qualitative differences in the results @xcite , so the limit @xmath37 is agreed to be continuous .",
    "the dynamic rule is specified as follows : each time step is thought of as one generation of the discrete evolutionary time , where every node @xmath27 of the system plays with its nearest neighbors and accumulates the payoffs obtained during the round , say @xmath38 .",
    "then , individuals are allowed to synchronously change their strategies by comparing the payoffs they accumulated in the previous generation with that of a neighbor @xmath28 chosen at random .",
    "if @xmath39 , player @xmath27 keeps the same strategy for the next time step , when it will play again with all of its neighborhood . on the contrary , whenever @xmath40 , @xmath27 adopts the strategy of @xmath28 with probability @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "note that this dynamic rule , though stochastic , does not allow the adoption of irrational strategy , _",
    "@xmath43 whenever @xmath44 .",
    "let us now specify precisely the family of networks on top of which the evolutionary pd game is evolved .",
    "strategists are located on the vertices of a fixed graph of average connectivity @xmath45 .",
    "the heterogeneity of the networks is controlled by tuning a single parameter @xmath46 , so that when @xmath47 the networks are of the erds - renyi class of random graphs , and when @xmath48 they are of the barabsi - albert ( ba ) @xcite scale - free networks class . let s first describe the algorithm to construct a ba network of size @xmath49 . in this case , one starts from a fully connected set of @xmath50 nodes and at each time step a new node is linked to @xmath51 nodes preferentially chosen , namely , the probability that node @xmath27 receives one new link is proportional to its degree , @xmath52 . avoiding multiple connections and iterating the preferential attachment rule @xmath53 times a sf network with an exponent @xmath54",
    "is generated .",
    "on the other hand , random single - scale networks are built up following the standard recipe to generate er networks @xcite .",
    "finally , networks with an intermediate degree of heterogeneity can be built following the recipe introduced in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm combines the mechanisms of preferential ( with probability @xmath46 ) and uniform random linking ( @xmath55 ) in such a way that starting from @xmath47 and increasing its value , the networks generated are successively more homogeneous with a heavy tail whose exponent is equal to ( @xmath47 ) or larger than ( @xmath56 ) @xmath54 .    from any initial condition @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 if node @xmath27 is an instantaneous cooperator and @xmath59 if defector ) , and after many generations , the instantaneous fraction of cooperators @xmath60 in the stochastic trajectory , @xmath61 , fluctuates around a well - defined mean value @xmath15 , which depends on the parameter @xmath62 , as well as on the particular initial condition .",
    "the transient time @xmath63 that we allow before measuring observable quantities is assured to be larger than the one required for the stationarity of @xmath15 ( see below ) .",
    "the average level of cooperation @xmath64 is computed as the average of @xmath15 over initial conditions ( of fixed fraction @xmath65 of cooperators ) , and network realizations .",
    "we numerically identify as pure cooperators all those individuals that _ always _ cooperate , for all times larger than the transient time @xmath63 .",
    "pure defectors are those that _ always _ defect for any @xmath66 .",
    "fluctuating nodes are those that are neither pure cooperators nor pure defectors . in this way we estimate the measure of the partition sets ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) . to inspect the connectedness of the sets of pure strategists , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we define cooperator ( @xmath67 ) and defector cores ( @xmath68 ) as clusters ( connected subgraphs ) fully composed by pure cooperators and defectors , respectively , their numbers being denoted by @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is easy to realize that for generic ( irrational ) @xmath62 values , no pure defector can be a neighbor of a pure cooperator , so that the presence of both types of nodes in the long - term stochastic trajectory , assures the existence of fluctuating nodes .",
    "the time scale of microscopic invasion processes ( updating rule ) is controlled by @xmath71 , which is the highest connectivity of pair s nodes ; this makes that very high payoff of a hub due to its very high @xmath11 is sensibly balanced by @xmath72 @xcite , with the side effect that the invasion processes from and to hubs are slowed down , if hub s ( and neighbor s ) payoff is much smaller than its connectivity @xmath11 . on the other hand , the transient time @xmath63 should be greater than characteristic fixation times for nodes in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , if one is interested in measuring observable quantities associated to the partition .",
    "fixation times of strategies at the nodes in turn , obviously depends on the initial conditions ( i.e. , on @xmath65 , the initial fraction of cooperators ) , so that henceforth in the simulations we use a variable time window , @xmath63 , of at least @xmath73 generations as the transient time .",
    "once the system is at ( a fluctuating ) equilibrium regarding stationarity of @xmath74 , we let the dynamics evolve for @xmath73 additional time steps , while measuring quantities .",
    "all the results have been averaged over at least @xmath75 different realizations of the networks and initial conditions .",
    "most of the results shown below correspond to @xmath76 nodes , though other values have been also used ; we will comment on this issue in the concluding section .",
    "the initial conditions for the stochastic trajectories that we consider here are such that an initial number @xmath77 of nodes ( @xmath78 ) are randomly chosen as cooperators . in fig.[fig2 ] we show , for some values of the parameter @xmath62 , how the stationary value of @xmath64 depends on the initial fraction @xmath79 of cooperators for er and ba networks .",
    "as seen in that figure , @xmath64 typically increases with @xmath79 until saturation is reached much before @xmath79 approaches @xmath80 .",
    "one observes that saturation occurs sooner for smaller values of @xmath62 .",
    "these features are common for both classes of networks .",
    "however some details of the @xmath81 curves are different : first , for er networks , the departure from zero of @xmath82 occurs , as @xmath62 increases , only above some ( @xmath62-dependent ) threshold value of the initial fraction of cooperators ; on the contrary , for ba networks @xmath64 departs from zero as soon as @xmath83 , at all values of @xmath62 inside the coexistence region .",
    "second , saturation is more perfect for er networks , while for ba graphs the plateau in the @xmath84 curve has some small positive slope .    the variation with the game parameter @xmath62 of the stationary ( asymptotic ) average cooperation , @xmath85 , for several values of @xmath65 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for er graphs ( upper panel ) and ba networks ( lower panel ) . in the case of er networks ,",
    "different initial concentrations @xmath65 produce a family of curves that mainly differs in their tails in such a way that the larger the value of @xmath65 , the slower the decay of @xmath64 as @xmath62 increases , in correspondence with the perfect saturation of @xmath84 at fixed @xmath62 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . on the other hand , in ba networks the effects of different initial conditions",
    "are appreciated in the whole range of @xmath62 values .",
    "we thus see that degree heterogeneity not only favors the survival of cooperation , but also makes the value of the average cooperation , at fixed @xmath62 value , more dependent on initial conditions . in",
    "this regard one should note that er networks , often termed as homogeneous , have indeed some small heterogeneity , _ i.e. _ the degree distribution density has a non - zero variance .",
    "in fact , the average level of cooperation in er networks is clearly enhanced with respect to random regular networks ( where all the nodes have exactly the same degree @xmath11 ) , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "in other words , even the small amounts of heterogeneity of er networks , are enough to allow for cooperation - promoting feedback mechanisms to work .",
    "as stated in the introductory section [ intro ] , it has been reported in @xcite that for any asymptotic trajectory there is a partition of the network into three sets , namely the set @xmath12 of pure cooperator nodes , the set @xmath13 of pure defector nodes , and the set @xmath14 of fluctuating nodes . from now on we denote by @xmath86 the measure ( relative size ) of the set of pure cooperators ( averaged over initial conditions and network realizations ) , and by @xmath87 that of the set of pure defectors .",
    "the behavior of @xmath88 and @xmath89 versus the game parameter @xmath62 is plotted in fig.[fig3 ] for different initial distributions as a function of the parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the first remarkable result is that in er networks , the density of pure cooperators does not depend on @xmath65 for the _ whole _ range of @xmath62 values , in sharp contrast to the above mentioned results for the tails of the average level of cooperation @xmath90 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as anticipated in the introduction",
    "[ tachan ] ) , there are two additive contributions to the average fraction @xmath64 of cooperators , namely the measure @xmath88 of the set of pure cooperators , and the overall fraction of time @xmath17 spent by fluctuating nodes as cooperators , weighted by the relative size @xmath91 of the fluctuating set :    @xmath92    though the first contribution is , for er networks , independent of @xmath65 , the second one does indeed depend on initial conditions , as inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the relation @xmath93 .",
    "high initial concentrations of cooperators favor the fluctuating set @xmath14 at the expense of pure defectors , while the number of nodes where fixation of cooperative strategy occurs remains largely unaffected : @xmath88 is thus being mainly determined by the network structural features .",
    "for example , in our simulations , for large values of @xmath62 where @xmath88 is very small , we have observed that the pure cooperator nodes form cycles .",
    "the fixation of cooperation in these structures is assured if none of their elements is linked to a fluctuating individual that , while playing as a defector , is coupled to more than @xmath94 cooperators , where @xmath95 is the number of cooperators attached to the element .",
    "the number of such structures is finite in er graphs , but as soon as their vertices are occupied by cooperators , they will be immune to defectors invasion .",
    "the bottom panel of figure .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the results obtained for ba networks . regarding the proportion of pure cooperators ,",
    "one may differentiate two regimes : for @xmath96 , there is a moderate dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath65 , while @xmath88 is almost independent of @xmath65 for larger values of @xmath62 .",
    "this behavior correlates well with our observations @xcite on the distribution of strategists inside the degree classes . in the first range ,",
    "pure cooperators are present in all @xmath11-classes and fluctuating individuals are almost homogeneously disseminated over low - to - intermediate @xmath11 classes . however , for @xmath97 , there is a @xmath62-dependent value of @xmath11 , say @xmath98 , such that @xmath11-classes are fully occupied by pure cooperators if @xmath99 while basically no pure cooperators are found in lower @xmath11-classes . in this second range , where the degree - strategy correlations are strong",
    ", the influence of @xmath65 on the asymptotic proportion of pure cooperators is very small .",
    "while as discussed in previous paragraphs , the proportion of pure cooperators is either independent ( er ) or slightly dependent ( ba ) on initial concentration @xmath65 , the measures of the other sets in the partition , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , are indeed more influenced by the initial conditions .",
    "the dependence of @xmath89 on @xmath65 for ba and er networks is qualitatively the same , that is , the proportion of pure defectors is favored ( at the expense of the fluctuating set ) by a higher initial proportion of defectors .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of degree preference ( correlation ) of pure defectors , which can not take distinctive advantage of degree inhomogeneity : the higher their instantaneous payoff , the more likely they invade neighboring nodes , which has the effect of diminishing their future payoff .",
    "finally , we analyze the connectedness of the pure strategists sets , as measured by the number of cooperator cores @xmath69 , and defector cores @xmath70 . for ba networks , and @xmath100 , we had reported in @xcite the result that for all values of @xmath62 where @xmath12 is not an empty set , it is connected , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath101 .",
    "this result turns out to be independent of @xmath65 ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) : there is only one cooperator core in ba networks , which contains always the most connected nodes , for any initial fraction of cooperators .",
    "the grouping of pure cooperators into a single connected set @xmath12 allows to keep a significant fraction of pure cooperators isolated from contacts with fluctuating nodes .",
    "this `` eden of cooperation '' inside @xmath12 provides a safe source of benefits to the individuals in the frontier , reinforcing the resilience to invasion of the set .",
    "pure defectors , on the contrary , do not benefit from grouping together , and the set @xmath13 appears fragmented into several defector cores .",
    "note that for values of @xmath102 , where the set @xmath13 is empty , @xmath103 , while for very high values of @xmath62 defection reaches fixation in the whole network , so that @xmath104 .",
    "thus , @xmath105 must increase first and then decrease to @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the computed @xmath105 curves for ba networks for several values of @xmath65 .",
    "it is remarkable that these curves almost collapse , in spite of the fact that the fraction @xmath89 of pure defectors does indeed depend on @xmath65 , a numerical fact for which we have not found a plausible explanation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we also show for er graphs @xmath106 and @xmath105 , for different values of @xmath65 . regarding the number of cooperator cores , we see that except in the small range @xmath107 , the different curves coincide , in fair agreement with the independence of @xmath88 on initial conditions .",
    "note that in the small interval where they do not coincide , the fraction @xmath88 of pure cooperators is below @xmath108 , for all values of @xmath65 . on the other hand",
    ", we see that for higher initial proportion @xmath65 of cooperators , the set @xmath13 is more fragmented and also that @xmath70 reaches its maximal values at higher values of @xmath62 .",
    "in order to inspect how the results depend on the distribution of nodes degrees , we have monitored the same magnitudes studied throughout this paper when the value of @xmath46 varies between @xmath109 and @xmath80 . as introduced above",
    ", this makes the networks less heterogeneous as @xmath46 grows and approaches @xmath80 .",
    "figure[fig5 ] shows , from left to the right , the average level of cooperation @xmath64 , the density of pure cooperators @xmath88 and the density of pure defectors @xmath89 as a function of @xmath62 for several values of @xmath46 . in this case , the initial distribution of cooperators was set to @xmath100 , i.e. , the nodes have the same probability to cooperate or defect at @xmath110 .",
    "the results show that indeed the densities of pure strategists and the average level of cooperation do depend on @xmath46 , that is to say , the figure confirms the role played by the underlying topology .",
    "the more homogeneous the graph is , the smaller the level of cooperation in the system .",
    "moreover , the transition for different values of @xmath46 is smooth and does not exhibit an abrupt crossover from one kind of behavior ( @xmath47 ) to the other ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we have also explored how nodes where strategies have reached fixation are organized into clusters of cooperation and defection as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] summarizes our computations for the number of cooperator cores . in this case , we have represented @xmath69 as a function of @xmath111 ( that grows with @xmath62 ) in order to have the same scale for different values of @xmath46 until cooperation breaks down .",
    "the observed dependence with @xmath46 is again smooth and no abrupt change in the behavior of this magnitude occurs .",
    "it is worth stressing that as soon as the underlying network departs from the limit @xmath47 corresponding to a ba scale - free network ( whose @xmath112 ) , the number of @xmath67 slightly differs from @xmath80 .",
    "this means that some realizations give rise to more than one cluster of @xmath67 .",
    "the probability to have such realizations is very small , but in principle , they are possible . as @xmath46",
    "is further increased beyond zero , it is clear that pure cooperators do not organize anymore into a single cooperator core .",
    "we think that this deviation is due to the fact that when @xmath56 the exponent @xmath113 of the underlying network , which still is a scale - free degree distribution , is larger that @xmath114 .",
    "it is known that this value of @xmath113 marks the frontier of two different behaviors when dynamical processes are run on top of complex heterogeneous networks @xcite .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of epidemic spreading . for @xmath115 ,",
    "the second moment of the degree distribution @xmath116 diverges in the thermodynamic limit , while it is finite if @xmath117 . as the critical properties of the system are determined by the ratio between the first ( that remains finite for @xmath118 ) and the second moment , the divergence of the latter when @xmath119 and @xmath120 , makes the epidemic threshold null . on the contrary , when the process takes place in networks whose @xmath117 , the epidemic threshold is recovered , although no singular behavior is associated to the critical point @xcite .",
    "we expect that a similar phenomenology is behind the results shown in fig .",
    "it would be very interesting to test this hypothesis by simulating the pd implemented here on top of scale - free networks with an exponent in between @xmath121 and @xmath114 . as a byproduct ,",
    "such a study may guide our search of analytical insights and provides a deeper understanding of what drives the structural organization of cooperation at the microscopic level .",
    "scale - free - structured populations offer to the cooperative strategy the opportunity of positive feedback evolutionary mechanisms making cooperation a most fitted overall strategy , in spite of not being a best reply to itself in one - time step .",
    "we have shown here that the enhancement of cooperation due to the heterogeneity of the structure of connections among agents is robust against variation of initial conditions ( initial concentration @xmath65 of cooperators ) : while both the measure of the set @xmath12 where cooperation reaches fixation , and its connectedness properties are either independent or only slightly dependent on @xmath65 , the measure of the fluctuating set @xmath14 and the set @xmath13 where defection is fixed , both show a clear dependence on initial conditions , for defection can not profit from degree heterogeneity .",
    "on the other hand , the characteristics of the asymptotic evolutionary states of the prisoner s dilemma analyzed here , show a smooth variation when the heterogeneity of the network of interconnections is one - parametric tuned from poissonian to scale - free , demonstrating a strong correlation between heterogeneity and cooperation enhancement .",
    "though the numerical results presented here correspond to network sizes @xmath76 ( in section [ initial ] ) and @xmath122 ( section [ heterogeneity ] ) , we have study also larger networks ( up to @xmath123 ) , with no qualitative differences in the results .",
    "the increase of network size , while keeping constant the average degree @xmath124 , turns out to be beneficial for cooperation , due to the fact that it has the effect of increasing the maximal degree , and thus the range of degree values .",
    "this further confirms how efficiently cooperation takes advantage from degree heterogeneity .",
    "the robustness of these results against game parameters variation will be analyzed elsewhere @xcite , one should expect that the network partition ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) along asymptotics stochastic trajectories is generic in evolutionary game dynamics in graphs , for the kind of stochastic updating rule considered here . our results also suggest that more works are needed in order to fully characterize the behavior of the pd game in heterogeneous graphs .",
    "the use of real networks , with emphasis on the role of mesoscopic ( community ) structures is addressed in @xcite .",
    "of particular interest would be to perform the sort of analysis carried out here in scale - free networks with an exponent @xmath125 , which will make it feasible to connect evolutionary dynamics with other dynamical processes taking place on top of scale - free networks .",
    "our hope is that this sort of study might provide a deeper understanding of what is going on at the microscopic level and might help to comprehend what universal mechanisms drive the evolution of complex heterogeneous networks as well as the reasons behind their ubiquitous presence in nature .",

    "<S> recent studies on the evolutionary dynamics of the prisoner s dilemma game in scale - free networks have demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the network interconnections enhances the evolutionary success of cooperation . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we find that the measure and the connectedness properties of the set of nodes where cooperation reaches fixation is largely independent of initial conditions , in contrast with the behavior of both the set of nodes where defection is fixed , and the fluctuating nodes . </S>",
