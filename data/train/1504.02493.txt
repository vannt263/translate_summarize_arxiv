    "for several years , measurements of , and related to , the forward - backward asymmetry in top - quark pair production ( @xmath5 ) at the tevatron were consistently higher than the standard model ( sm ) predictions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry at high invariant mass ( @xmath6 gev ) was quoted to be 3.4 standard deviations above the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd prediction  @xcite .",
    "this result sparked much work  both theoretical and experimental , within and beyond the sm ( bsm )  trying to find the source of the discrepancy .",
    "see  @xcite for a review .    one proposal to help solve the problem was to measure the forward - backward asymmetry in bottom - quark pair production ( @xmath7 )  @xcite , and the analogous charge asymmetry at the lhc ( @xmath8 )  @xcite , see also  @xcite",
    ". such a measurement would likely be difficult due to dominance of gluon fusion initiated bottom pair production , which does not generate an asymmetry , over @xmath9 initiated production , the dominant top pair production mechanism .",
    "in addition , there were expected to be further complications due to @xmath10-tagging inefficiencies , and processes such as neutral @xmath11-meson oscillations and cascade decays spoiling the correlation between the charge of the decay products and the charge of the parent @xmath10-quark .",
    "however , the upside would be valuable information about the flavor structure of the source of the top asymmetry .",
    "calculations of the bottom - quark @xmath12 in the sm including some electroweak ( ew ) effects had been made both before  @xcite , and after  @xcite these proposals .    in  @xcite , it was realized that a @xmath0-boson decaying to @xmath13 would have significant consequences for the analysis of the bottom - quark asymmetry .",
    "to decay to @xmath14 , so these effects are not nearly as strong in @xmath5 . ]",
    "it was found that near the @xmath0-pole , tree level exchanges of electroweak gauge bosons dominated the sm contribution to the @xmath12 .",
    "this is unlike the top asymmetry where nlo qcd is the leading contribution .",
    "far enough above the @xmath0-pole , nlo qcd does provide the leading sm contribution to the bottom asymmetry .",
    "the effects of various bsm scenarios on @xmath7 , and their relation to @xmath5 , were also investigated in  @xcite .. ] however , the @xmath14 asymmetry discrepancy has recently been resolved through a combination of theoretical and experimental work , namely results from d0 using the full tevatron run-2 dataset  @xcite , and a sm prediction of @xmath5 at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the interim , measurements of @xmath7 by the cdf  @xcite and d0 collaborations  @xcite and of @xmath8 by the lhcb  @xcite collaboration were made , and a new @xmath15 discrepancy has appeared .",
    "the preliminary results of cdf at high invariant mass  @xcite are both consistent with zero , and agree with the sm predictions of  @xcite .",
    "in addition , cdf was able to exclude a wide axigluon with a mass of 200 gev as an explanation of @xmath5 , while not excluding an axigluon with a mass of 345 gev .",
    "the preliminary results of cdf at low mass  @xcite agree with the sm predictions of  @xcite , including a measured asymmetry in the bin containing the @xmath0-pole that is larger than the asymmetry in the adjacent invariant mass bins .",
    "lhcb updated their preliminary analysis of 7 tev data  @xcite after ref .",
    "@xcite came out to include an additional invariant mass bin centered on the @xmath0-pole . in their published result , ref .",
    "@xcite , they find that central value of @xmath8 in this @xmath0-pole bin is the largest of the three bins in the analysis , similar to the prediction for @xmath7 in  @xcite",
    ". however , there was no dedicated sm prediction for this measurement at the time it was released .",
    "d0 did an analysis  @xcite of the forward - backward asymmetry in charged @xmath11-meson production , @xmath16 , rather than a jet based analysis like cdf and lhcb . clearly , there will be none of the charge tagging systematic issues discussed earlier in an analysis with charged mesons .",
    "also , because d0 used an inclusive sample of @xmath17 they have more events and thus a smaller statistical uncertainty as well .",
    "however , this inclusiveness comes at the price of including far more gluon fusion initiated events , which dilute the already small asymmetry .",
    "d0 s result is @xmath18 \\%$ ] .",
    "this is consistent with zero .",
    "however , this is also 3.3 standard deviations below their sm prediction of @xmath19 \\%$ ] , which was made using mc@nlo+herwig  @xcite .",
    "d0 also finds that the measured asymmetry is lower than their sm prediction for all pseudorapidities , and for @xmath20 gev .",
    "d0 has also made a measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath21 and @xmath22 production  @xcite .",
    "this baryon asymmetry measurement is consistent with zero though it has large uncertainties , and central values that are large in magnitude .",
    "note that the @xmath21 asymmetry is expected to be dominated by hadronic effects  @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is not considered further in this work .",
    "the analogous effect at the lhc , @xmath23 , is seen at high rapidity by cms  @xcite , and in the preliminary results of lhcb  @xcite .",
    "the predictions made in  @xcite for cdf are updated to include mixed ew - qcd corrections in an approximate way .",
    "these corrections are found to be small in magnitude , and cdf s measurements are found to be in good agreement with the sm predictions .",
    "the charge asymmetry at 7 tev measured by lhcb is found to be in good agreement with standard model .",
    "it is also predicted that the charge asymmetry at 13 & 14 tev will be smaller than at 7 & 8 tev .",
    "the sm asymmetry is predicted to be very small for d0 , which is consistent with what was measured .",
    "several bsm models , including a 100 gev axigluon model , are ruled out by this combination of sm predictions and measurements . on the other hand",

    "is neglected in all cases except for the inclusive d0 asymmetry .",

    "@xcite finds that including @xmath49 , but not @xmath46 in the nlo qcd calculation of the top @xmath12 decreases the asymmetry by 25% , and that the full @xmath47 term increases the top asymmetry by 13% .    in",
    "@xcite it was noted that the @xmath50 contribution to @xmath7 is small compared to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 terms , and their associated uncertainties . that statement is made quantitative in this work by computing the @xmath50 contribution in an approximate way .",
    "the qed corrections are known to be in a one - to - one correspondence with the qcd asymmetry ; one simply makes the following replacement for a given partonic channel : @xmath51 however , the mass of the @xmath0 spoils this correspondence for the weak corrections . in this approximation ,",

    "sometimes there is a partial cancellation between the scale uncertainty from the tree level ew contribution and the nlo qcd contribution . the qcd piece gets smaller as the scale increases because it is proportional to @xmath66 , whereas the ew piece gets bigger as @xmath64 increases because it scales as @xmath67 .",
    "the additional , symmetric uncertainty in the last column is due to the neglect of higher - order qcd contributions .",
    "as previously stated , this uncertainty is taken to be 30% of the pure qcd asymmetry , as is typically done .    as a check on the calculation ,",
    "we have computed the nlo qcd contribution to the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry .",

    "the scale uncertainty is artificially small in the @xmath76 gev bin due to a partial cancellation between the @xmath36 and @xmath35 terms .",

    "we are mindful that because d0 measured an exclusive hadronic final state , a perturbative calculation may not necessarily be relevant .",
    "however , d0 finds the that rms width of the distribution of @xmath81 is 0.11  @xcite ; see  @xcite for more information .",

    "as previously noted , there is good agreement between the sm predictions in this work and the d0 measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "the d0 observations and their predictions from mc@nlo+herwig differ at the 3@xmath2 level , with the mc prediction being larger than what was measured the majority of the time .",
    "note also that the d0 baryon analysis also finds that mc@nlo+herwig predicts an asymmetry that is larger than what was measured  @xcite .",
    "in what follows a discussion is given of the estimation of the mixed ew - qcd corrections , the charm - quark charge asymmetry , and the implications of this work for bsm scenarios .      inspecting tables  [ tab : cdfhigh ] and  [ tab : cdflow ] it is seen that the @xmath50 terms make small contributions to the bottom @xmath12 relative to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 terms , and their associated uncertainties .",

    ". however , the sum of all the contributions to the asymmetry in the @xmath95 bin only changes from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "this change is smaller than the scale uncertainty , and it is also smaller than the uncertainty due to the neglect of higher - order qcd terms .      there is also some interest in measuring the charge asymmetry in charm - quark production  @xcite , and lhcb may well have the charm - tagging capabilities to do so .",
    "a full study of the sm contribution to the charm asymmetry is left for future work . instead , in this work",
    ", we consider a previously neglected , tree - level contribution to the heavy quark charge asymmetry due to @xmath3-channel @xmath4 exchange . for the top and bottom asymmetries , this contribution is rightfully neglected because it is highly cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) ( or bottom pdf ) suppressed .",
    "however , there is less suppression for the charm - quark asymmetry because it is only a first to second generation transition .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the asymmetric piece of the interference between @xmath107-channel gluon exchange and @xmath3-channel @xmath4 exchange has not previously been given in the literature ,    @xmath108    where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the ckm matrix .",

    "however , the @xmath116 initiated @xmath3-channel @xmath4 exchange does not interfere with @xmath107-channel gluon exchange , so its effect on the asymmetry should also be small compared to the inference contribution .",
    "potential collinear singularities are regulated by the mass of the @xmath4 , so based on counting powers of coupling constants , the size of the asymmetry due to @xmath4 exchange should be suppressed by about an order of magnitude compared to the nlo qcd contribution to the asymmetry .",

    "<S> predictions are made for the forward - backward and charge asymmetries in bottom - quark pair production at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> tree - level exchanges of electroweak ( ew ) gauge bosons dominate the standard model ( sm ) contribution to the asymmetry near the @xmath0-pole . </S>",
    "<S> the mixed ew - qcd corrections are computed in an approximate way , and are found to be small in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> these sm predictions are consistent with experimental results from cdf , d0 , and lhcb . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , cdf and lhcb find that the asymmetry in the invariant mass bin containing the @xmath0-pole is larger than in the adjacent bins , as predicted . </S>",
    "<S> several beyond the standard model scenarios proposed for the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry , including a 100 gev axigluon , are disfavored by this combination of sm predictions and measurements . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , modified @xmath1 couplings can explain the 2@xmath2 discrepancy in the bottom - quark forward - backward asymmetry at lep1 , while being consistent with the results of cdf and lhcb . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that @xmath3-channel @xmath4 exchange makes a non - negligible contribution to the charm - quark charge asymmetry . </S>"
