    "the theory of strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , predicts that at sufficiently high energies nuclear matter transforms into a deconfined state where nucleons are no longer the basic constituents but rather quarks and gluons .",
    "the event - by - event fluctuations @xcite of suitably chosen observables opens new possibilities to investigate the properties of the so called `` qcd phase diagram '' .    in general",
    ", one can classify fluctuations into two parts .",
    "first , dynamical fluctuations which result from correlated particle production reflecting the underlying dynamics of the system . second , statistical fluctuations induced by the measurement process itself due to the finite event multiplicity .    in case of independent particle production",
    "the multiplicity fluctuations follow a poisson distribution . to quantify particle correlations the observable @xmath0was proposed in ref .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath3 = \\dfrac{\\langle n_{a}^{2 } \\rangle}{{\\langle n_{a } \\rangle}^{2 } } +   \\dfrac{\\langle n_{b}^{2 } \\rangle}{{\\langle n_{b } \\rangle}^{2 } } -   2\\dfrac{\\langle n_{a}n_{b } \\rangle}{\\langle n_{a } \\rangle\\langle n_{b } \\rangle } - \\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\langle n_{a } \\rangle } + \\dfrac{1}{\\langle n_{b } \\rangle}\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the numbers of particle types a and b in a given event and @xmath6 denotes averaging over events .",
    "the quantity @xmath0vanishes when the multiplicity distributions of both particle types are poissonian and independent from each other .",
    "since the negative terms in the formula of @xmath0contain a correlation term , negative values of @xmath0 indicate the degree of correlation between particle species .    in this article , we present the measurements of , and in pb - pb collisions at @xmath7=2.76  tev in alice .",
    "the results are compared to the hijing @xcite and ampt @xcite models as well as to measurements at lower energies from cern - sps @xcite and rhic @xcite .",
    "the present analysis uses about 13 million minimum bias pb - pb events at @xmath7=2.76  tev collected by the alice detector @xcite during the 2010 lhc run .",
    "the subdetectors involved in the analysis were the time projection chamber ( tpc ) for the tracking and particle identification and the inner tracking system ( its ) for the vertexing .",
    "moreover , the two forward v0 detectors were used for the centrality estimation . particle identification ( pid )",
    "was based on the measurement of the specific ionisation energy loss , d@xmath1/d@xmath2 , in the tpc gas .",
    "the charged particles reconstructed in the tpc in full azimuth and in the pseudo - rapidity range of @xmath80.8 were used in this analysis .",
    "the momentum range was restricted to 0.2@xmath9@xmath10@xmath91.5",
    "gev/@xmath11 in order to minimise the systematic uncertainties due to overlap of measured particle de / dx distributions .",
    "when the d@xmath1/d@xmath2distributions of different particle species are well separated , a unique particle identification is possible .",

    "the method follows a probabilistic approach using the inclusive d@xmath1/d@xmath2distributions measured in the tpc , and determines the moments of the multiplicity distributions by an unfolding procedure .",
    "it requires two basic experimentally measurable event - by - event quantities , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , which are defined as    @xmath14 , \\quad \\quad   w_{j } \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{n(n ) } \\omega_{j}(x_{i}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 stands for the d@xmath1/d@xmath2of a given track , @xmath15 is the d@xmath1/d@xmath2distribution of particle @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the inclusive d@xmath1/d@xmath2 distribution within a given event and @xmath18 is the number of tracks within the @xmath19th event . in other words , @xmath20 is a bayesian probability measure of being particle type @xmath16 for a given track .",

    "the moments of the @xmath12 distributions @xmath22 can be easily constructed directly from experimental data .",
    "the identity method provides the real moments @xmath23 of the particle multiplicity distributions by means of an unfolding procedure using the moments of these @xmath12 distributions .",

    "the identity method exploits the fits of inclusive d@xmath1/d@xmath2distributions for the calculation of @xmath13 .",
    "since the overlap regions in the d@xmath1/d@xmath2distributions are also allowed , one needs very good fits of inclusive d@xmath1/d@xmath2spectra over the full momentum range covered in the analysis .",
    "therefore , a good understanding of the detector response of the tpc is required . to this end ,",
    "clean particle samples , which were retrieved from v0 decay particles ( pions from @xmath24 decays , protons from @xmath25 decays and electrons from photon conversions ) , were used .",
