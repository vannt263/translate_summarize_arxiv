    "these are sets considered in lemma [ t : comb ] , and to prove the lemma we have to show that @xmath625      [ l : fiber1 ] let @xmath495 be the operator associated with the coordinate parallelepiped @xmath611 as in subsection [ ss : para ] . identifying @xmath626 and @xmath627 with the subsets of @xmath611",
    ", we get @xmath628    note that @xmath629 is a single point @xmath630 ( i.e. all coordinates in all rows except for row @xmath239 are fixed ) . for a point @xmath631 , denote by @xmath632 the coordinates of @xmath526 in row @xmath239 .",
    "let @xmath633 ( for @xmath634 ) be the sum of coordinates in row @xmath240 . by definitions of @xmath635 and @xmath495",

    "lemma [ l : fiber1 ] will follow from proposition [ p : paramitosis1 ] once we check that @xmath626 satisfies the hypothesis of the proposition . we know that @xmath626 is closed under @xmath536-moves since @xmath622 is closed under ladder - moves",
    "we can split @xmath626 into the union of @xmath536-classes @xmath641 where @xmath572 and @xmath642 , respectively , have nonempty and empty initial parabox . by remark [ r : paramitosis ]",

    "we now replace @xmath7 with a reduced face @xmath162 with the same permutation and non - empty initial parabox as follows . in the face diagram of @xmath7 , delete the edge corresponding to @xmath676 and add the new edge @xmath677 .",
