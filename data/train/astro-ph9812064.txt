    "an amazing variety of astrophysical phenomena can be attributed to magnetohydrodynamic shocks , and in particular to their ability to accelerate charged particles to high energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "shock acceleration is believed to account for the bulk of the galactic cosmic rays ( @xcite ) and solar cosmic rays ( @xcite ) observed near the earth .",
    "there is a variety of mechanisms by which shocks can accelerate particles , as indicated by direct observations within the solar system .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( @xcite ) , based on the first - order fermi acceleration mechanism ( @xcite ) , can accurately account for acceleration at the earth s bow shock ( @xcite ) and traveling interplanetary shocks ( @xcite ) , whereas stochastic acceleration , or second - order fermi acceleration ( @xcite ) , is apparently the dominant mechanism in the vicinity of cometary bow shocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "several lines of evidence indicate the distributed acceleration of energetic ions over a wide range of heliolongitudes during gradual solar flare / coronal mass ejection ( cme ) events ( @xcite ) , presumably due to cme - driven shocks , though it is not clear whether the first- or second - order fermi mechanism is responsible for initial particle acceleration near the sun . as cme shocks move outward from the sun , they become traveling interplanetary shocks , and as such a shock passes a detector , intensity enhancements or anisotropy variations of energetic particles are often recorded .",
    "evidence that such intensity enhancements can represent true acceleration , not mere pile - up , comes from major spectral changes ( @xcite ) . at energies",
    "@xmath1 mev , there is clear evidence that particles can be accelerated out of the solar wind population ( @xcite ) , presumably by diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "however , for energies @xmath2 mev , all observations to date of ionic charge states near the times of interplanetary shock arrivals are inconsistent with a solar wind origin , indicating that the ions were originally accelerated out of coronal material ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , tan et al .",
    "( 1989 ) provided compositional evidence that ions of @xmath3 mev observed at the time of shock passage represent the same population as ambient solar energetic particles .",
    "the above evidence indicates that particles are injected into the interplanetary medium while the shock is still near the sun , and later this particle population may be further affected by the shock as it propagates through the inner heliosphere .",
    "this leads one to the question of how an oblique shock ( i.e. , a shock in which the magnetic field is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the shock normal ) further accelerates existing populations of energetic charged particles .    note that close to an oblique shock , the diffusion approximation does not provide an accurate description of the spatial or directional distribution of energetic particles .",
    "the goal of the present work is to examine the spatial and pitch angle distribution that arises due to the transport and acceleration of an existing particle population near an oblique shock . to the author s knowledge , this represents the first solution of the pitch angle transport equation on both sides of an oblique , non - relativistic shock for non - ultrarelativistic particles .",
    "( for ultrarelativistic particles at oblique shocks , for which one can set @xmath4 , see @xcite ; for parallel shocks and non - relativistic particles , see @xcite . )",
    "therefore , we have started with the simplest case of an oblique shock with a constant magnetic field on either side in a medium with a spatially uniform scattering mean free path ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it is hoped that this will lay the groundwork for further studies of particle acceleration integrated into the framework of a pitch angle transport equation that will consider other effects for particular types of shocks ; these could include a realistic magnetic field configuration , a spatially dependent scattering amplitude , a self - consistent treatment of wave generation and pitch angle scattering , or other effects .    the basic process of charged particle acceleration by planar , parallel shocks has been worked out in the diffusion approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "decker & vlahos ( 1986 ) and jokipii ( 1987 ) found that for oblique shocks the rate of particle acceleration increases with the shock angle , i.e. , the angle between the magnetic field and the shock normal .",
    "in addition , there is a characteristic length over which the particle distribution increases upstream of the shock , given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coefficient of spatial diffusion ( due to pitch angle scattering ) , @xmath7 is the fluid speed relative to the shock , @xmath8 is the particle speed , and @xmath9 is the spatial mean free path along the magnetic field . in the inner heliosphere ,",
    "@xmath9 is typically 0.08 to 0.3 au ( @xcite ) , and for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 mev ) , this length scale is on the order of 17@xmath9 , or 1.4 to 5 au .",
    "thus a model with a constant diffusion coefficient does not explain the more localized increases observed as an interplanetary shock passes the earth .",
    "one explanation is that the diffusion coefficient may decrease near a shock due to increased magnetic turbulence generated by accelerated particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the large changes in particle anisotropies",
    "that are sometimes observed during shock passage ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicate a breakdown in the diffusion approximation , so a detailed treatment should also consider the pitch angle distribution .",
    "recently , the epam instrument on the ace spacecraft has been able to measure complex pitch angle distributions close to the time of shock passage ( @xcite ) ; models of shock acceleration should attempt to reproduce such distributions .",
    "furthermore , changes in the pitch angle distribution of relativistic ions ( mainly galactic cosmic ray protons ) as an interplanetary shock approaches , representing precursors to a forbush decrease accompanying the shock ( @xcite ) can be measured by ground - based neutron monitors and could provide advance warning of approaching shocks ( @xcite ) , which can induce geomagnetic storms and affect satellites , communications , and power grids at earth .",
    "clearly the implementation of such a warning system would rely on an accurate understanding of the pitch angle distribution of energetic ions upstream of an interplanetary shock .",
    "kirk & schneider ( 1987a ) presented an approximate analytic solution of a pitch angle transport equation for highly relativistic particles near a parallel shock discontinuity ( i.e. , one in which the magnetic field is parallel to the shock normal ) , giving insight into the variety of length scales corresponding to higher orders of anisotropy near the shock ( the length scales also apply to non - relativistic particles ) .",
    "this work was extended to oblique shocks by kirk & heavens ( 1989 ) .",
    "monte carlo techniques have provided important information on the pitch angle distribution near the shock ( @xcite ) , the final spectrum ( @xcite ) , the rate of particle acceleration vs.  the magnetic field - shock angle ( @xcite ) , the injection of particles from a thermal population and its decreased efficiency for larger magnetic field - shock angles ( @xcite ) , compositional selection effects ( @xcite ) , and the relative importance of first- and second - order fermi acceleration at shocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we adopt a different approach by incorporating the treatment of an oblique shock discontinuity into a finite - difference numerical solution of a pitch angle transport equation .",
    "previously , numerical techniques have been developed to treat the pitch angle dependent transport of energetic particles in the inner heliosphere ( @xcite ) , recently including the effects of adiabatic deceleration and convection ( @xcite ) , and these have been used to analyze observations of solar energetic particles ( @xcite ) and solar neutron decay particles ( @xcite ) . including the injection of particles from other sources , such as a traveling interplanetary shock , has proven more difficult .",
    "previous authors have set the simulation boundary at the shock and assumed an _",
    "ad hoc _ particle injection function , say , @xmath13 , finding the function that best fits the observed data for a given event and energy range ( @xcite ; kallenrode 1997a , b ) . in principle",
    "this allows one to examine the dependence of @xmath13 on physical parameters of the shock , though there are a number of such interrelated parameters , which complicates the interpretation of the association between @xmath13 and any individual parameter .",
    "our approach is in a sense the reverse : we examine what parameter dependence should be expected based on certain physical processes . since diffusive shock acceleration is a manifestation of particle transport in the vicinity of the shock , we include both sides of the shock discontinuity in the calculation , with special treatment of particles crossing the shock based on the conservation of the magnetic moment , to examine both the transport and further acceleration of energetic charged particles near the shock .",
    "we are able to examine the effects of the shock - field angle and the form of the pitch angle scattering on the steady - state particle distribution in space and pitch angle for an idealized model of an oblique shock . as a further application of our method",
    ", we apply it to explain the observed precursors of forbush decreases before the arrival of an interplanetary shock .",
    "before describing the methodology in detail , we present a brief overview of shock acceleration .",
    "the process of `` diffusive shock acceleration '' refers to the acceleration of charged particles as they are repeatedly scattered back and forth across a shock front , which for the present purposes is a discontinuity in the fluid speed and magnetic field strength .",
    "this process does not require the diffusion approximation and can be examined by lower - level descriptions in terms of pitch angle scattering ( @xcite ) or particle orbits in a disordered magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "originally the literature discussed two mechanisms of acceleration at shocks :    \\1 . in the first - order fermi acceleration mechanism ( @xcite ) , particles gain energy when scattering off of converging magnetic field irregularities . at a shock , this occurs because the field irregularities are convected with the fluid flow ( in the rgime in which the alfvn speed is smaller than the fluid speed relative to the shock ) , and the upstream fluid flows toward the shock faster than the downstream fluid flows away . in this rgime",
    ", scattering tends to isotropize the momentum while preserving its magnitude in the local fluid frame .",
    "when a particle heads toward the shock ( in the local fluid frame ) in either direction , the frame transformation leads to a higher momentum in the new local fluid frame , which is conserved until the particle encounters the shock again .",
    "after two such crossings of the shock , the particle has a higher momentum in its original reference frame .    \\2 . in the shock drift mechanism ( @xcite ) ,",
    "particles drift along an oblique shock front due to the sharp gradient in the magnetic field , and this drift is along the direction of the electric field so that particles can gain a substantial amount of energy in one encounter with the shock .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the distinction between these two mechanisms vanishes in the de hoffmann - teller ( shock ) frame ( @xcite ) where the electric field is zero .",
    "the entire energy change due to mechanisms 1 and 2 is accounted for by transforming the particle momentum from the local fluid frame into the shock frame , considering the energy - conserving shock encounter in the shock frame , and then transforming the momentum into the new local fluid frame ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ note , however , that there is still a lateral drift along the shock , which is important , e.g. , for the acceleration of anomalous cosmic rays at the solar wind termination shock ( @xcite ) . ] for an oblique shock , the term diffusive shock acceleration is now generally used to refer to this unified description of particle acceleration that includes both mechanisms 1 and 2 .",
    "the basic mechanism of particle acceleration at an oblique shock , as described above , includes two processes : a ) frame transformations , as in first - order fermi acceleration , and b ) a change in pitch angle as the particle encounters the shock ( which does not occur for a parallel shock ) . processes a ) and",
    "b ) are related to parallel and perpendicular changes in the fluid velocity , respectively .",
    "thus they are directly analogous to the two components of adiabatic deceleration in the solar wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are associated with the divergence of the wind parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field and have been termed `` an inverse fermi effect '' and `` betatron deceleration , '' respectively . just as betatron deceleration is an effect of adiabatic focusing ( also known as magnetic mirroring ) when viewed in the local fluid frame ( @xcite ) , which in turn represents the conservation of the magnetic moment @xmath14 , for the case of shock acceleration the change in pitch angle as particles encounter the shock approximately conserves the magnetic moment as well ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic moment is actually conserved , then we do not need to concern ourselves with the details of the particle orbit near the shock ; we treat the entire particle - shock interaction as a single event , and consider whether a particle ultimately crosses or is reflected by the shock , which is assumed to depend only on the initial pitch angle .",
    "figure 2 provides a schematic illustration ( for a non - relativistic particle ) of acceleration at an oblique shock .",
    "[ for an analogous illustration for adiabatic deceleration , see figure 1 of ruffolo ( 1995 ) . ]",
    "the components of the particle velocity , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , refer to motion parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively ( the pitch angle is the angle with respect to the positive @xmath15 axis ) . let us take the upstream direction to be to the right ; then the upstream and downstream flow speeds with respect to the shock frame are negative ( `` u '' and `` d , '' respectively , in figure 2 ) .",
    "a particle with @xmath17 is moving from the upstream side toward the downstream side .",
    "the velocity relative to point `` d '' is greater than that relative to point `` u , '' so if the particle crosses to the downstream side , the magnitude of its velocity is greater in the new local fluid frame , and this velocity magnitude is conserved by further scattering in that frame .",
    "similarly , a particle with @xmath18 can cross from downstream to upstream , and again the magnitude of the velocity increases in the new local fluid frame .",
    "a third type of shock encounter ( for oblique shocks ) is when a particle from upstream ( @xmath17 ) reflects back upstream with @xmath19 in the shock frame ; again , we see that the magnitude of the velocity increases in the fluid frame .",
    "in addition to the frame transformations described above , i.e. , standard first - order fermi acceleration for parallel shocks , at oblique shocks there is the additional process of a change in pitch angle as a particle crosses the shock . at first glance",
    "it is not immediately obvious why this process should lead to acceleration as opposed to deceleration . to see this ,",
    "consider again a particle with @xmath17 crossing the shock from upstream to downstream ( figure 2 ) . in the shock",
    "frame the large - scale magnetic field configuration is static , so the particle speed in this frame , @xmath20 , is conserved .",
    "if we assume approximate conservation of the magnetic moment , then @xmath16 will increase , since the magnetic field is stronger on the downstream side . as can be seen in figure 2 ,",
    "the speed relative to the downstream fluid ( `` d '' ) increases ; the dotted line indicates a curve of constant speed in the downstream fluid frame .",
    "thus this process leads to an additional increase in energy in the new local fluid frame , beyond that due to the frame transformation . similarly",
    ", a particle with @xmath18 is moving from downstream to upstream , and approximate conservation of the magnetic moment implies a decrease in @xmath16 . then the speed relative to the upstream fluid ( `` u '' ) increases ; the dashed line indicates a curve of constant speed in the upstream fluid frame .",
    "the change in pitch angle can be quite large , so this can lead to a substantial increase in the energy gain at oblique shocks .",
    "there can also be a significant effect on the pitch angle distribution , which makes particle transport and acceleration at oblique shocks more difficult to model than that at parallel shocks .      to our knowledge",
    ", this work represents the first treatment of oblique shock acceleration within a finite difference simulation of pitch angle transport , so as a first step this work considers only a simple , planar , oblique shock with straight magnetic field lines on either side ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we consider only subluminal shocks so that we can work in the de hoffmann - teller reference frame ( which we also refer to as the `` shock frame '' ) in which the shock is stationary , the fluid flow is parallel to the magnetic field , and the electric field is zero ( @xcite ) .    ruffolo ( 1995 ) provided an equation of focused pitch angle transport ( eq .  [ 11 ] of that paper ) that included solar wind effects , such as adiabatic deceleration and convection , to first order in @xmath21 in an archimedean spiral magnetic field .",
    "when we consider a region of constant magnetic field on either side of the shock , that equation reduces to @xmath22    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     in equation  ( [ eq : tr ] ) , the first term on the right hand side represents the effect of streaming , the second is for convection ( including the relativistic correction for transforming the streaming speed into the shock frame ) , and the third is for pitch angle scattering .",
    "the particle density in a flux tube , @xmath23 , is related to the phase space density , @xmath24 , by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cross - sectional area of the flux tube .",
    "we use @xmath23 in the simulations , following ng and wong ( 1979 ) , because we can easily design the numerical finite difference method to strictly conserve this quantity during streaming and convection , even when @xmath27 and @xmath28 are spatially varying .",
    "the pitch angle scattering coefficient , @xmath29 , is expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scattering amplitude and @xmath32 controls the form of the scattering coefficient .",
    "this expression , originally derived in the context of quasi - linear theory ( @xcite ) , is adopted as a convenient and widely used parameterization . in this work",
    "we will consider @xmath33 , for isotropic scattering , and @xmath34 , which is in the range of 1.3 to 1.7 inferred by bieber et al .",
    "( 1986 ) for interplanetary scattering . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath35 implies a deficit in scattering near a pitch angle of 90@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ; the effect of such a deficit on shock acceleration has also been examined by kirk ( 1988 ) .",
    "in addition to our numerical solution of equation  ( [ eq : tr ] ) ( see  2.6 ) , it is possible to find analytic solutions in the steady state if we restrict the @xmath38 domain to one side of the shock . setting @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\cdot\\frac{\\pd}{\\pd\\mu } ( 1-\\mu^2)|\\mu|^{q-1 } \\frac{\\pd}{\\pd\\mu }      \\left(1-\\mu\\frac{uv}{c^2}\\right)f .",

    "to first order in @xmath21 , the analogous quantity defined in terms of variables in the solar wind frame is given by @xmath44 ( @xcite ) , so we can simplify equation ( [ eq : ss1 ] ) to read @xmath45 } \\frac{\\pd}{\\pd\\mu }     ( 1-\\mu^2)|\\mu|^{q-1 } \\frac{\\pd f_w}{\\pd\\mu},\\ ] ] again neglecting terms of order @xmath46 .",

    "the assumption of a power - law dependence in the steady state is not a problem because @xmath138 so that @xmath55 does not vary with momentum .",
    "now we turn to the boundary conditions at the edges of the simulation region . at a reasonable distance from the shock front",
    ", we can employ the diffusion approximation , in which equation ( [ eq : tr ] ) can be expressed as a diffusion - convection equation . in the manner of earl ( 1974 ) , we set @xmath139 , where @xmath140 , @xmath141 is an odd function of @xmath41 , and higher - order even functions are neglected . by separating the transport equation into odd and even parts , integrating each over @xmath41 , and neglecting the time dependence of @xmath141 ( i.e. , assuming @xmath142 ) , we obtain @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the @xmath38-flux and the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath6 , is given by equation ( [ eq : d ] ) . equation ( [ eq : da ] ) should be obeyed on either side of the shock , with special jump conditions at the shock as described above .",
    "note that either @xmath23 or the phase space density , @xmath24 , may be used in these equations and in the following discussion .",
    "we note further that in terms of @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 and if @xmath147 , so that @xmath148 is the dipole anisotropy in the mixed frame , we obtain @xmath149 where @xmath150 represents the dipole anisotropy of @xmath151 , the distribution function defined entirely in terms of independent variables in the solar wind frame .    in the diffusion approximation solution of krymskii ( 1977 )",
    ", there are boundary conditions that @xmath23 remain finite as @xmath51 . in the steady state ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : da ] ) requires that @xmath152 be constant on either side of the shock , so we have @xmath153 with different constants @xmath31 and @xmath154 upstream or downstream . to avoid divergence far downstream ,",
    "we must have @xmath155 , so @xmath156 is constant , with @xmath157 .",
    "upstream , we have @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is @xmath156 far upstream of the shock , representing the existing particle population that is accelerated by the shock .    in the numerical solution of equation  ( [ eq : tr ] ) in terms of @xmath38 we can only treat a finite domain . however , the diffusion approximation is valid sufficiently far from the shock ( see  2.3 ) , with @xmath160 , so setting @xmath152 at the boundaries of the simulation region is approximately equivalent to fixing its value at @xmath161 . at the upstream boundary , we set @xmath152 to a constant ( for a given @xmath42 ) that is interpreted as @xmath162 . at the downstream boundary , @xmath152",
    "is set to @xmath163 at the boundary . in the diffusion approximation ( eq .",
    "[ 12 ] ) , this implies that @xmath164 , and also that the anisotropy is given by @xmath165 ; the distribution function in the wind frame is @xmath44 and thus has a dipole anisotropy of zero .",
    "the numerical simulations reported here employed the finite difference method of ruffolo ( 1995 ) as substantially modified by nutaro , riyavong , & ruffolo ( in preparation ) .",
    "the latter report will contain details of the modifications and testing of the new code . here ,",
    "for completeness , we briefly outline the changes to the treatment of streaming and convection , and the treatment of particles crossing the shock . for a description of other aspects of the numerical method which remain unchanged ,",
    "the reader is referred to ruffolo ( 1995 ) .",
    "changes to the treatment of streaming and convection were motivated by the work of hatzky ( 1996 ) , who used the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "while our previous numerical method ( ruffolo 1991 , 1995 ) eliminated spatial differencing and hence numerical diffusion in the evaluation of these terms , it required a small step size , @xmath166 . on the other hand ,",
    "the tvd algorithm permits only a very small amount of numerical diffusion for significantly larger @xmath167 .",
    "the result is that the new code runs 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster .",
    "another benefit is that convection is now treated in each step instead of by occasional jumps as in our previous method , yielding much smoother profiles without spatial averaging .",
    "the previous method was adequate for the transport of solar energetic particles , where one could average over a moderate spatial interval , and the jumps merely yielded small - amplitude oscillations in the intensity as a function of time .",
    "however , for the present simulations of steady - state shock acceleration , with multiple reflections from the boundaries and a requirement of fine spatial resolution , the new treatment of streaming and convection was essential in obtaining the smooth profiles shown here . the results for steady - state particle acceleration at a parallel shock provide a sensitive test confirming the accurate treatment of streaming and convection .    in our implementation , we modified the standard tvd algorithm in order to permit a courant number , @xmath168 , greater than one .",
    "this permits an arbitrary @xmath167 , and in particular , for @xmath169 we were able to reproduce results for solar energetic particles that used our previous code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other modification of the code was to treat how particles cross the shock , which was also part of the streaming / convection step . for each @xmath41-@xmath38 grid point",
    ", we determine whether particles will stream / convect as far as the shock . if so , we perform a lorentz transformation into the shock frame , allow particles to cross or reflect while conserving the magnetic moment , and perform another lorentz transformation back into the local wind frame ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "the tvd algorithm effectively splits a cell into fractions of particles destined to move to two different spatial locations ; at the shock we generalize this approach to split cells into fractions destined to move to different @xmath41-cells as well .",
    "the accuracy of this technique is verified by the numerical results for steady - state shock acceleration at oblique shocks , which are consistent with a sum of separable solutions of the transport equation (  2.3 ) on either side of the shock .",
    "in a steady state , an equilibrium is reached in the evolution of the particle distribution function in terms of position , pitch angle , and momentum . in the present simulations , we assume that the momentum dependence is given by @xmath134 , so we find the value of @xmath170 that yields a steady solution for @xmath23 in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath41 .",
    "figure 6 indicates the flux balance that determines @xmath170 .",
    "well away from the shock , we can use the diffusion approximation ( see  2.5 ) to say that the net @xmath38-flux far downstream is due to convection : @xmath171 , where @xmath172 .",
    "far upstream , there is a balance between convection toward the shock and diffusion away , so that @xmath173 , where @xmath159 is the far upstream flux . here",
    "we set @xmath174 , so there is a net outflow of particles from the shock in the downstream direction .",
    "this is balanced by the @xmath42-flux , @xmath175 , representing acceleration at the shock of particles from lower momenta to the momentum of interest , as well as from the momentum of interest to higher momenta , for the appropriate steady - state power - law index , @xmath170 .",
    "before considering oblique shocks , we tested our methodology for the case of a parallel shock ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "fluid and magnetic field parameters were as listed in table 1 .",
    "we considered protons with speeds @xmath177 and @xmath178 , corresponding to kinetic energies of 145 and 4.7 mev and momenta of 541.7 and 94.3 mev @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "we used grid spacings of @xmath180 and 0.005 , respectively , and @xmath181 . for convenience , we set @xmath182 .",
    "outer boundaries were placed at @xmath183 and @xmath184 for @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "the numerical treatment of the boundary conditions assumed @xmath174 and was sufficiently accurate that the proper behavior of @xmath23 in the diffusion approximation was maintained out to within a few grid points from the boundaries , and the location of the boundaries did not influence @xmath23 near the shock .",
    "a full simulation required about 2 hours of cpu time on a sun ultra-1 workstation .",
    "figure 7 ( top panel ) shows the spatial dependence of the pitch angle averaged phase space distribution , @xmath187 , near a parallel shock for @xmath185 and @xmath33 ( @xmath188 is the upstream region ) .",
    "as explained in  2.2 , our simulations solve for @xmath189 , the density of particles in a flux tube , which is related to @xmath24 by @xmath25 , where @xmath190 is the cross - sectional area of a flux tube ; therefore , @xmath191 .",
    "for a parallel shock , @xmath154 is equal on the upstream and downstream side , so @xmath192 . throughout this section ,",
    "@xmath24 is normalized to 1 far downstream . from figure 7",
    "we see that for a parallel shock , the spatial dependence of @xmath187 is simply that expected in the diffusion approximation (  2.5 ) , i.e. , constant downstream and exponentially decaying to zero upstream with @xmath193 .",
    "the pitch angle dependence was also the same as in the diffusion approximation .",
    "the same results were obtained for @xmath34 and for @xmath11 with @xmath33 and 1.5 .    for a coarser @xmath41-grid spacing ,",
    "a spurious peak was obtained in @xmath187 , which tends toward zero as @xmath194 ( a remnant of this is barely visible in the top panel of figure 7 ) .",
    "even for a fine grid spacing , one anomaly is that a value of @xmath195 was needed for a steady state ( i.e. , to conserve the flux of particles in the simulation region ) for @xmath196 or 0.1 and @xmath33 or 1.5 , whereas acceleration theory for parallel shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) yields @xmath197 or 2.034 for these fluid parameters .",
    "the assumptions of that theory should apply given that @xmath198 is that expected from the diffusion approximation .",
    "we believe that the systematic error in @xmath170 obtained from the simulations arises from the assumption of a power - law dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath42 , which neglects the momentum dependence of @xmath199 ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "the key problem is that the upstream anisotropy of @xmath23 depends on @xmath137 . as a test ,",
    "the code was modified to artificially add an `` extra '' anisotropy for lower momenta , i.e. , to multiply @xmath23 upon acceleration by a @xmath41-dependent factor to account for the higher anisotropy of @xmath23 at the lower momentum from which a particle was accelerated , yielding a similar @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "we conclude that this explanation can in fact account for a systematic error in @xmath170 of the observed magnitude , and that @xmath170 is more sensitive to the assumption of a power - law dependence than is the distribution of particles in space or pitch angle .    turning to oblique shocks , figure 7",
    "shows the spatial dependence of @xmath187 for @xmath201 and 4 and for @xmath33 and 1.5 . in all cases , the distribution function farther from the shock is consistent with the diffusion approximation , with @xmath202 constant downstream and exponentially decaying upstream with @xmath193 .",
    "a conspicuous feature of figure 7 is the jump ( discontinuity ) in @xmath187 at an oblique shock ( the finite slope is due to the finite grid spacing in @xmath38 ) .",
    "this feature was also found in simulations by ostrowski ( 1991 ) , gieseler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and t.  naito ( private communication , 1998 ) .",
    "gieseler et al .  (",
    "1998 ) present a detailed theoretical and computational analysis of this feature , as well as possible observational signatures .",
    "we find that the jump is stronger for more oblique shocks , and weaker for @xmath34 than for @xmath33 .",
    "the amplitude of the jump is on the order of a few percent for such fast particles ( @xmath185 ) , and our simulations indicate that the jump is stronger for slower particles ( @xmath11 ) , i.e. , a higher @xmath55 .",
    "another difference from the case of a parallel shock is that for oblique shocks , additional eigenfunctions are excited in @xmath198 near the shock .",
    "( if one is not sufficiently careful in treating the boundary conditions , as i was not during the initial stages of this work , additional eigenfunctions are also excited near the boundaries ; discretization errors also yield spurious eigenfunctions near the shock , which become negligible for 95 @xmath41-grid points as used here . ) for all steady - state simulations , @xmath198 was consistent with a sum of separable solutions of equation ( 3 ) . for @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) ,",
    "figure 8 shows the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath41 and @xmath38 within @xmath205 of the shock , and figure 9 shows @xmath24 as a function of @xmath41 for @xmath206 .",
    "( recall that we use @xmath41 and @xmath42 to refer to quantities in the local fluid frame ; thus these plots are for a constant value of the local @xmath42 .",
    "a compton - getting transformation to the shock frame would have no noticeable effect on our distribution plots . ) for @xmath201 , the results were qualitatively similar but with weaker anisotropies .    in figure 9",
    ", we see that upstream distributions ( thick lines ) increase with @xmath41 up to @xmath207 ( with a slightly stronger anisotropy than in the far upstream region ) , and for greater @xmath41 values , @xmath24 drops sharply .",
    "the reason for the sharp drop is that given our assumption of conservation of the magnetic moment , particles with @xmath208 , or 0.85 in this case , have come from downstream .",
    "a similar drop in @xmath24 has been called a `` deficit cone '' ( @xcite ) or `` loss cone '' effect ( @xcite ) for the case of galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) depletion at high @xmath41 upstream of an interplanetary shock , which is due to the paucity of gcr coming from downstream ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the same effect occurs here because the acceleration of particles coming from downstream is weaker than for particles reflected from upstream .",
    "the greatest acceleration occurs for particles reflected with the greatest change in pitch angle ( see figure 2 ) , i.e. , for @xmath41 slightly below 0.85 .",
    "since stronger acceleration implies that @xmath24 is advected from lower momenta , and the particle spectrum increases with decreasing momentum in this case , the strongest acceleration corresponds to the greatest increase in @xmath24 .    in the downstream region ,",
    "particles are redistributed in pitch angle because of changes in pitch angle as particles cross the shock ; the average flux also increases slightly due to acceleration .",
    "it is worth noting that for a highly oblique shock , most particles coming from upstream are in fact reflected , i.e. , when @xmath209 , or in the case of a strong , highly oblique shock , for pitch angles more than 30@xmath36 from the magnetic field direction .",
    "another feature of figures 8 and 9 is the sharp gradient in @xmath24 at @xmath37 for the case of @xmath34 . for this form of the pitch angle diffusion coefficient",
    ", @xmath210 tends to zero as @xmath211 .",
    "since the @xmath41-flux , @xmath212 , is slowly varying in a near - equilibrium situation , the vanishing diffusion coefficient at @xmath37 is able to sustain an infinite gradient in @xmath23 at that value .",
    "we believe that this behavior of @xmath24 as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath41 is not an artifact of the assumption of a power - law momentum dependence because when an extra anisotropy was artificially added , the @xmath41 and @xmath38 dependence ( including the jump at @xmath213 ) was not significantly affected ; this was also the case for parallel shocks .",
    "on the other hand , computed values of @xmath170 are strongly affected by the power - law assumption , so that this code in its present form is essentially unable to determine @xmath170 . the error in @xmath170 was much weaker for @xmath196 than for @xmath214 ( because of the lower @xmath137 ratio ) .",
    "as an example , for @xmath33 the @xmath170 values required for a steady state with @xmath185 were 1.965 and 1.952 for @xmath201 and 4 , respectively , while with @xmath11 they were 1.985 and 1.787 , respectively .",
    "otherwise , the results regarding @xmath198 for @xmath214 were qualitatively similar to those shown in figures 7 to 9 for @xmath196 , with much stronger anisotropies and jumps in @xmath187 at the shock .      to demonstrate the versatility of this method ,",
    "we apply it to model forbush decreases of galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) as an interplanetary shock passes the earth ( @xcite ) , which represent a transient phenomenon instead of a steady state . ground - based neutron monitors",
    "measure secondary neutrons from the impact of relativistic , primary charged particles , mainly protons , on the upper atmosphere . due to selective deflection by the earth s magnetic field , neutron monitor observations are sensitive to primary cosmic rays from specific directions in space , and the worldwide network of neutron monitors provides detailed information on their pitch angle distribution , sensitive to variations on the order of 0.1% .",
    "precursors to forbush decreases are of practical interest as possible predictors of space weather effects on the earth , such as satellite failures , radio fade - outs , power outages , etc . , several hours or even days before the passage of a major interplanetary shock .",
    "several analyses of neutron monitor observations have indicated two types of precursors to forbush decreases : 1 ) an enhanced diurnal anisotropy of gcr , with an excess of particles traveling toward the sun along the interplanetary magnetic field , and 2 ) a deficit of gcr in a  loss cone , \" i.e. , along a narrow range of pitch angles directed nearly along the interplanetary magnetic field away from the sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "we model the forbush decrease in a rather idealized manner , assuming the configuration of figure 1 and neglecting particle drifts ( @xcite ) , spatial dependence of the scattering mean free path , shock curvature , the finite spatial extent of the interplanetary shock , adiabatic focusing , and adiabatic deceleration .",
    "nevertheless , we can explain the basic features of the observed precursors , verifying their interpretation in terms of particle transport in the vicinity of an oblique shock .",
    "the simulation conditions were inspired by the dramatic cme event of 1997 april 7 , which arrived near earth on april 10 - 11 , and for which a possible loss cone feature is identified by bieber & evenson ( 1997 ) . in this case , the travel time of 3 days indicates a shock speed of @xmath215 km s@xmath114 or only 200 km s@xmath114 faster than the ( typical ) solar wind speed . assuming that the shock normal is radial , we take the upstream shock - field angle to be the typical `` garden - hose '' angle of 45@xmath36 ( @xmath201 ) , and as before we assume @xmath113 km s@xmath114 .",
    "thus we find @xmath216 km s@xmath114 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 , which in turn implies that particles crossing the shock from downstream have pitch angles aligned with the magnetic field to within 40@xmath36 ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "we used @xmath34 , which adequately describes interplanetary scattering ( bieber et al .",
    "for the upstream boundary condition , we specify a constant @xmath159 ( see  2.5 ) , and the initial condition sets @xmath23 to that constant in the upstream region and to zero in the downstream region .",
    "we used @xmath220 ( 45 @xmath41-grid points ) and @xmath221 , where @xmath222 au .",
    "we considered @xmath223 , corresponding to a kinetic energy of 480 mev .",
    "for the momentum spectrum , we assumed @xmath224 , according to the model proton spectrum of reinecke , moraal , & mcdonald ( 1996 ) for the similar polarity solar cycle of 1977 .",
    "however , the simulation results were very insensitive to the gcr spectral index .",
    "figure 10 shows the omnidirectional gcr intensity as a function of position ( normalized to 1 just upstream of the shock ) .",
    "as the shock moves past a fixed observer , one sees a gradual precursor decline and a slight recovery as the shock approaches .",
    "such gradual declines in some observations were noted by cane et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in their one figure for such a forbush decrease ,",
    "that of 1972 oct 31 ( figure 5 of that paper ) , it is seen that 2 out of 3 neutron monitor stations observed a relative peak near the time of shock onset",
    ". it would be interesting if the omnidirectional flux could be estimated from the worldwide neutron monitor network for such events for direct comparison with the results of numerical simulations .    at the shock itself",
    ", we see a jump reminiscent of that found in  3.1 for shock acceleration with @xmath174 ( figure 7 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus this model predicts a discontinuous drop at the shock followed by a more gradual decline which we identify as the declining slope of a forbush decrease .",
    "we note , however , that this model can not hope to accurately reproduce the detailed features of the forbush decrease itself , given its simplistic assumptions ( see also  4 ) .",
    "the phase space distribution , @xmath24 , as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath38 is shown in figure 11 , and pitch angle distributions in the near upstream ( @xmath225 ) and far upstream ( @xmath226 ) regions are shown in figure 12 .",
    "we see that there is an overall enhanced sunward anisotropy both downstream and upstream , where it persists over several mean free paths from the shock .",
    "close to the shock , we also find the second type of observed precursor feature with a sharp decline in the loss cone region .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that @xmath198 upstream is approximately given by a sum of steady - state separable solutions .",
    "if a steady state has not been achieved , separable solutions of the full transport equation involve an eigenvalue equation similar to equation ( 5 ) with @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the decay time .",
    "given the weak sensitivity of eigenvalues to @xmath55 ( except @xmath65 ) , the longest - lived solutions should be similar to the steady - state solutions of equation ( 5 ) with some modification to @xmath102 .",
    "the time scale of evolution of a forbush decrease , @xmath2291 day , is much longer than the travel time of particles across the distance scales of interest , @xmath22910 minutes , so it is reasonable that transient solutions have disappeared leaving only nearly stationary solutions of the transport equation .",
    "both types of observed precursors of forbush decreases are readily understood in terms of the upstream simulation results , as expressed as a superposition of separable solutions of equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the constant solution in the far upstream region corresponds to the zero eigenvalue .",
    "the contribution of the first eigenfunction is opposite in sign to that seen in  3.1 , corresponding to an anisotropy directed toward the sun over a long spatial scale .",
    "turning to the next eigenfunction , corresponding to @xmath97 , the spatial decay scale of the steady - state eigenfunction is 0.074@xmath9 , and in the time - dependent simulations this feature has a spatial scale length of @xmath230 along the magnetic field , or @xmath231 in the radial direction .",
    "this eigenfunction appears with the same sign as in figure 4 for shock acceleration ( figure 9 ) and represents a deficit of particles in the loss cone ( @xmath232 ) that came from the downstream region which is depleted in gcr , as well as an enhancement of particles with @xmath41 just below 0.76 which were accelerated during reflection from the shock .",
    "several examples of loss - cone deficits were given by nagashima et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and sakakibara et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and an enhancement for certain pitch angles corresponding to reflection and acceleration at the shock was reported by belov et al .",
    "the predicted spatial decay length for these features depends only weakly on the shock speed or obliquity ( i.e. , the eigenvalues depend only weakly on @xmath137 , especially for relativistic velocities ) , but there is a significant dependence on @xmath32 ( see eq .  [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the results shown here , with precursor features roughly of the magnitude reported by cane et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , were for a simulated duration of 7.4 hours , which is substantially shorter than the actual time it takes a shock to propagate from the sun to the earth ( typically 2 to 4 days ) .",
    "this is probably due to our neglect of enhanced spatial diffusion near the shock , which must be present in order to account for the sharp gcr gradient at the onset of a forbush decrease .",
    "stronger scattering would stem the tide of equilibration and lead to a longer duration of these features .",
    "the numerical simulation procedure developed in this work is the first to solve a pitch angle transport equation on both sides of an oblique , non - relativistic shock without assuming an ultrarelativistic particle velocity .",
    "here we have shown applications of the technique to study oblique shock acceleration in the steady state , and to consider the time - dependent problem of forbush decreases and in particular their precursors . to explore the capabilities and limitations of this type of solution ,",
    "we have started with the simplest case of a plane - parallel , oblique shock with straight magnetic field lines on either side ( figure 1 ) and a spatially uniform scattering mean free path .",
    "clearly this simple model is neglecting a variety of important processes , which will be discussed shortly .",
    "one limitation in this work was our assumption of a power - law dependence of the distribution function on the particle momentum .",
    "in further work this assumption should be relaxed , i.e. , the simulations should treat different values of the momentum , as has been done by kirk & schneider ( 1989 ) .",
    "this assumption has strongly affected calculated values of the particle spectrum , but based on test runs that artificially compensate for the error , it seems not to have significantly affected the spatial and pitch angle distributions .",
    "this should be checked in future work .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) techniques are undoubtedly more popular than the finite difference method used here , and mc simulations are very well - suited for exploring certain phenomena . here",
    "we use a finite difference method for consistency with an existing code that includes a variety of effects known to be important for interplanetary transport ( ruffolo 1995 ) so that the treatment of the shock can be readily incorporated into such simulations . for transport simulations in general ,",
    "finite difference or eigenfunction expansion techniques have some advantages , such as often requiring less computing time , the absence of statistical error , straightforward extrapolation to reduce discretization error , easier treatment of a high dynamic range in particle density , and a straightforward and continuous implementation of analytic expressions for scattering and other processes ( for a comparison of different techniques , see @xcite ) .",
    "the last of these is also a notable limitation in situations where analytic expressions are not available , e.g. , situations requiring the tracing of particle orbits . if the tracing of particle orbits is only necessary near the shock , that could be implemented in a finite difference code by a `` transfer matrix '' based on a one - time evaluation of the probability of various outcomes at the shock for each @xmath41-grid point .    to the author s knowledge , calculated pitch angle distributions for steady - state acceleration of energetic particles at a non - relativistic oblique shock",
    "have not reported previously .",
    "such pitch angle distributions should be directly comparable with recent and upcoming _ in situ _ observations near interplanetary shocks . as observed distributions",
    "are reported in greater detail , they can be expected to challenge the theoretical models and help indicate which additional physical processes have important effects on particle transport and acceleration at interplanetary shocks .",
    "the pitch angle distributions for steady - state shock acceleration represent the superposition of pitch angle eigenfunctions with different amplitudes , as first described by kirk & schneider ( 1987a ) .",
    "the amplitudes of different eigenfunctions can only be determined by treating how particles cross the shock .",
    "the upstream pitch angle distributions obtained here for oblique , non - relativistic shocks and mildly relativisitic particles ( figure 9 ) are qualitatively very different from those found for parallel , relativistic shocks and ultrarelativistic particles ( kirk & schneider 1987a , b , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the non - relativistic case , those authors found that even for a parallel shock , eigenfunctions beyond those present in the diffusion approximation are excited . the upstream pitch angle distribution is highly collimated in the direction away from the shock .",
    "the downstream distribution for the parallel , mildly relativistic shock ( @xmath233 ) is qualitatively similar to what we find for oblique , non - relativistic shocks .",
    "our results can be more directly compared with the pitch angle scattering results of naito & takahara ( 1995 ) , who treated oblique , mildly relativistic shocks with @xmath234 .",
    "we find qualitatively similar upstream pitch angle distributions but very different downstream distributions ; for high obliquity ( and high @xmath235 ) those of naito & takahara ( 1995 ) are strongly collimated with particles moving away from the shock .",
    "the second application considered here , to precursors of forbush decreases of galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) , demonstrates the ability of this method to simulate time - dependent phenomena .",
    "the eigenfunction analysis alone is sufficient to specify that in a steady state , one can have certain types of features in the pitch angle distribution over certain distance scales .",
    "for example , the observed increase in diurnal anisotropy well before the onset of some interplanetary shocks ( e.g. , cane et al .",
    "1996 , @xcite ) is identified with the eigenvalue @xmath65 and a long distance scale , and the superimposed excess for @xmath41 up to @xmath236 and strong deficit thereafter ( nagashima et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 , @xcite ) is identified with the eigenvalue @xmath97 and a distance scale of @xmath237 .",
    "the time - dependent simulations are necessary to verify that these modes are in fact excited with the appropriate sign and a reasonable amplitude , and that the time - dependent , upstream distribution is approximately represented by a superposition of steady - state eigenfunctions ( which is not the case downstream ) .",
    "we note that simulations of a forbush decrease with a parallel shock did not exhibit features corresponding to @xmath97 , which is an example of how not all eigenfunctions are excited in every situation .",
    "since a localized deficit in a narrow loss cone is in fact not expected for a parallel shock , this supports the physical explanation that the upstream deficit over a narrow range of pitch angles corresponds to particles crossing from the downstream region which is depleted in gcr ( @xcite ) .    as stressed earlier , this model of a forbush decrease",
    "is idealized in many ways , though it seems to be adequate for describing the key features of upstream precursors , which are of practical interest for short - term space weather forecasting ( @xcite ) by warning of the impending impact of a major interplanetary shock .",
    "we are much more hesitant to apply this idealized model to the forbush decrease itself . however , according to wibberenz , cane , and richardson ( 1997 ) , the key features of a forbush decrease can be captured by assuming enhanced scattering ( a lower mean free path ) in the region just downstream of the shock .",
    "this could easily be included in a simulation technique such as ours and a comparison with particle distributions observed during the course of forbush decreases could help identify what physical processes are crucial to the forbush decrease phenomenon .",
    "a key motivation for this work is the potential to include more physical effects in the future . for a more realistic magnetic field configuration , transport effects such as adiabatic focusing and deceleration",
    "can readily be included , as they have already been included in numerical simulations of interplanetary transport . enhanced scattering near a shock almost certainly affects acceleration and transport in that region , yet the magnitude and extent of such scattering for high - energy particles is not well understood .",
    "concrete models of the spatial dependence of the mean free path near a shock should be developed and tested for their success in explaining _ in situ _ observations .",

    "<S> we have developed a numerical simulation code that treats the transport and acceleration of charged particles crossing an idealized oblique , non - relativistic shock within the framework of pitch angle transport using a finite - difference method . </S>",

    "<S> for the former , we find that there is a jump in the particle intensity at the shock , which is stronger for more oblique shocks . </S>",
