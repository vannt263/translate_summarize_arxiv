    "in this paper we investigate the quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) , which is a well - known problem in combinatorial optimization ; we refer the reader to the book @xcite by ela and the book @xcite by burkard , dellamico & martello for comprehensive surveys on the qap .",
    "the qap in koopmans - beckmann form @xcite takes as input two @xmath0 square matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 with real entries .",
    "the goal is to find a permutation @xmath3 that minimizes the objective function @xmath4 here @xmath3 ranges over the set @xmath5 of all permutations of @xmath6 . in general , the qap is extremely difficult to solve and hard to approximate .",
    "one branch of research on the qap concentrates on the algorithmic behavior of strongly structured special cases ; see for instance burkard & al @xcite , deineko & woeginger @xcite , ela & al @xcite , ela , deineko & woeginger  @xcite , or laurent and seminaroti  @xcite for typical results in this direction .    in our paper",
    "we follow recent developments and represent several new results in this exciting area of research .",
    "in particular we discuss two new polynomially solvable special cases of the qap involving diagonally structured matrices , the so - called down - benevolent qap and the up - benevolent qap .",
    "further we focus on the so - called combined special cases of the problem .",
    "they arise as a combination of different polynomially solvable special cases of the qap which involve one coefficient matrix of a common type , respectively .",
    "this approach is interesting because it allows the identification of new and more complex polynomially solvable special cases of the qap .",
    "a short discussion on one of the combined special cases presented in this paper was published in @xcite .",
    "the are a number of results known on polynomially solvable special cases of the qap where the coefficent matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 possess specific structural properties . in an effort to classify the structural properties which seem to lead to polynomially solvable special cases of the qap we distinguish monotonicity properties , diagonal structural properties , block structural properties and properties related to so - called four - point condiditons . in the following we will define some matrix classes having properties of the type mentioned above and recall some results on polynomially solvable special cases of the qap known in the literature where these matrix classes are involved .    * monotonicity properties * + a symmetric matrix @xmath1 is a _ robinsonian dissimilarity _ or briefly a _ robinson matrix _ ,",
    "if for all @xmath9 it satisfies the conditions @xmath10 ; in words , the entries in the matrix are placed in non - decreasing order in each row and column when moving away from the main diagonal .",
    "a symmetric matrix @xmath1 is a _ robinsonian similarity _ , if for all @xmath9 it satisfies the conditions @xmath11 .",
    "an @xmath0 matrix @xmath2 is called _ monotone _ , if @xmath12 and @xmath13 holds for all @xmath14 , that is , if the entries in every row and column are sorted non - decreasingly from the left to the right and from the top to the bottom , respectively .    in some qap special cases considered in this paper the diagonal elements of the coefficient matrices",
    "do not impact the optimal solution . in these cases",
    "we assume them to be zero and set @xmath15 , for all @xmath16 .",
    "the robinson matrices were first introduced by robinson  @xcite in 1951 in the context of an analysis of archaeological data . since then they have been widely used in combinatorial data analysis ; see the books @xcite and the surveys @xcite for examples of various applications of robinsonian structures in quantitative psychology , analysis of dna sequences , cluster analysis , etc .",
    "special cases of the qap involving robinson matrices are discussed in laurent and seminaroti  @xcite .    * diagonal structural properties * + an @xmath0 matrix @xmath2 is called a _ toeplitz matrix _ if it has constant entries along each of its diagonals ; in other words , there exists a function @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , for all @xmath19 .",
    "the toeplitz matric @xmath8 is fully determined by the function @xmath20 and therefore @xmath20 will be called _ the generating function of @xmath8_.",
    "if @xmath21 holds for every @xmath22 , the toeplitz matrix @xmath8 is called a _ circulant matrix_.    a symmetric @xmath0 toeplitz matrix whose generating function @xmath20 fulfills @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be called a",

( these matrices where introduced in  @xcite as _ benevolent toeplitz matrices_.    analogously a symmetric @xmath0 toeplitz matrix @xmath8 whose generating function @xmath20 fulfills @xmath23 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for all @xmath30 , is called a _ down - benevolent toeplitz matrix_.    finally the attributes down - benevolent and up - benevolent will be also used for the generating functions of the toeplitz matrices having the corresponding properties , respectively .",
    "so we will talk about _ down - benevolent functions _ and _ up - benevolent functions _ defined over @xmath33 .",
    "the structures introduced above appeared in several special cases of the qap dealt with in the papers already cited in introduction .",
    "one of the most recent results was presented by laurent & seminaroti in @xcite , and will be of special interest in the context of the paper at hand . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the @xmath34 , where @xmath7 is a robinson matrix and @xmath8 is a simple toeplitz matrix is solved to optimality by the identity permutation .",
    "to help readers to better understand structures involved in various qap special cases , we use here a color coding to visualise these structures .",
