    "the numerical treatment of protein models is highly nontrivial . on one hand ,",
    "the design of realistic models suffers from the fact that the atomic interactions among the constituents of proteins and with their aqueous cellular environment are by no means well understood  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the computational effort increases drastically with the length of the molecules .",
    "therefore , significant simplifications of the realistic situation have to be introduced in order to facilitate a detailed analysis based on computational methods and , in particular , to allow studies of the relation between sequence and conformation spaces of model proteins .    herein , we will consider two versions of the very simple hp lattice model  @xcite which makes the following assumptions : instead of considering all 20 different kinds of amino acids that occur in real proteins the model comprises only two prototypes of residues : hydrophilic ( or polar , @xmath0 ) and hydrophobic ( @xmath1 ) monomers , respectively .",
    "this is to account for the fact that most of the naturally occurring amino acids can be classified in that way ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  154 ) . also the atomar interactions are drastically simplified .",
    "short - range repulsion between monomers is taken into account by modeling the conformations of hp proteins as _ self  avoiding walks _ on regular lattices . the simple cubic ( sc )",
    "lattice was used in this study .",
    "in addition one considers in the most simple formulation of the model exclusively a nearest ",
    "neighbor attractive interaction between hydrophobic residues non  adjacent in the polymer chain  @xcite .",
    "slightly more involved variants also take into account nearest - neighbor contacts between @xmath2 and/or @xmath3 pairs  @xcite .",
    "this is an effective way of describing the interaction of the molecule with the aqueous environment  @xcite .",
    "exact enumeration results obtained for short hp proteins can be used as cross ",
    "checks for other non  exact methods that search the conformational and sequence spaces of proteins .",
    "these include monte carlo and genetic algorithms ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , generalized ensemble techniques ( e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , chain growth algorithms ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and combinations thereof ( e.g.  refs .",
    "more importantly , the complete treatment of all sequences and conformations allows one to carry out systematic statistical analyses of hp proteins .",
    "our results for the sc lattice described in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite complement prior exact enumeration studies on the square lattice@xcite and for hp proteins with conformations _ restricted _ to regular cuboids on the sc lattice@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the hp models used here in a little more formal way .",
    "section  [ sec_ee ] explains the exact enumeration procedure in terms of which our results are obtained .",
    "the concept of exact enumeration is first illustrated with a naive implementation .",
    "what remains of section  [ sec_ee ] is dedicated to improvements of that simple implementation and describes how these improvements apply to a simple example case . in section  [ sec_appl ] we show how our exact results can be applied for a comparison of the numbers of self  avoiding walks and contact matrices and for the determination of designing sequences in the hp model .",
    "section  [ sec_sum ] concludes this article with a summary and an outlook on further statistical analyses based on the results of the enumerations presented here .",
    "an hp protein is defined by its sequence of monomers .",
    "we will denote the type of monomer by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the position of the monomer in a polymer chain of length @xmath6 and by convention @xmath7 .",
    "its conformation , which is a self  avoiding walk on the lattice ( with lattice spacing @xmath8 ) , is represented by an ordered collection of lattice vectors that contain the positions of the residues :  @xmath9 .",
    "the distance between monomers @xmath10 and @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the attractive interaction between pairs of residues is short  ranged on the underlying lattice .",
    "it is considered only between residues that are on nearest - neighbor positions but not covalently bound in the molecular chain .",
    "such a pair of residues is said to be in _",
    "contact_. this is expressed by the following energy function that is assigned to each hp protein : @xmath13 where @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and zero otherwise , is a symmetric @xmath16 matrix called _ contact map _ and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 interaction matrix .    in the present study ,",
    "the hp model comes in two versions that are different from one another in the way attractive interactions between the amino acids are considered . in the original version of the model@xcite , which we will refer to as hp model in the following , only a pair of hydrophobic residues in contact contributes to the energy function ( [ eqn_hp_emain ] ) and the only non  zero entry in the interaction matrix is @xmath19 .",
    "a modification of the model@xcite also takes into account an interaction between hydrophobic and polar monomers .",
    "we call it the mhp ( mixed hp ) model .",
    "its interaction matrix entries read @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath23 is motivated by an analysis of inter ",
    "residue contact energies between different types of real amino acids@xcite .    a sequence of monomers",
    "is called a _ designing sequence _ if there exists exactly one conformation ( up to trivial symmetries , to be explained in more detail below ) for its state of lowest energy .",
    "the interest in designing sequences is based on a generally accepted biochemical principle that sequence specifies conformation , and , in turn , the conformation of a polymer determines its biological function .",
    "accepting this principle also in the framework of the highly simplified hp model leads directly to the concept of designing sequences .",
    "the conformation of the lowest  energy state is uniquely determined for designing sequences only .",
    "furthermore , the number of designing sequences is very small compared to the total number of @xmath24 hp sequences of a given chain length @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the ability of identifying designing sequences may be seen as a benchmark for algorithms that search the sets of conformations _ and _ sequences of hp proteins .",
    "a straightforward method of identifying designing sequences of a given length is to perform an exact enumeration .",
    "this means to run through the whole set of sequences and for each sequence through the whole set of conformations .",
    "consider such a deliberately naive enumeration for short sequences of length @xmath25 in the hp model .",
    "trivially , there are @xmath26 different sequences and @xmath27 self  avoiding walks on the sc lattice .    up to symmetries , fig .",
    "[ fig_sawn4 ] shows all conformations for @xmath25 .",
    "only the conformation designated by ` fll ` has a contact between its first and last residues .",
    "consequently , all four hp sequences with a hydrophobic monomer in the first and last positions of the sequence must be designing : there is only one conformation for the lowest energy @xmath28 .",
    "all other sequences are non  designing since the energy @xmath29 is obviously degenerate .    when increasing the number of monomers @xmath6 by one , the number of sequences doubles .",
    "also , the number of self  avoiding walks ( saw ) is known to increase asymptotically by a factor of @xmath30@xcite .",
    "consequently , the computational effort scales roughly as @xmath31 , i.e. , exponentially fast with the chain length @xmath6 .",
    "this is why improvements of the naive enumeration become necessary even for rather short chain lengths .",
    "some of these improvements are very obvious .",
    "firstly , there is no point in carrying out the enumeration for two sequences that contain the same monomers but in reverse order .",
    "for example , the sequences ` hppp ` and ` ppph ` are equivalent . simply counting the number of relevant sequences , @xmath32 , that have to be considered in the enumeration yields @xmath33      [ cols=\"^,<,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     table  [ tab_wm_pap ] and the corresponding fig .",
    "[ fig_wm_pap ] show how     of self  avoiding walks and numbers @xmath34 of contact maps vs. the walk length @xmath35.,width=491 ]    the number of self  avoiding walks , @xmath36 , grows in comparison to the number of contact maps , @xmath37 , for chain lengths @xmath38 . for a given chain length ,",
    "there are many more self  avoiding walks than contact maps .",
    "the ratio between both numbers shown in the rightmost column of table  [ tab_wm_pap ] keeps growing with @xmath35 . the exponential growth , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig_wm_pap ] , can generically be described by the following scaling ansatz@xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a universal exponent and @xmath41 the effective coordination number . for self  avoiding walks we reproduce the well  known results @xmath30 and @xmath42  @xcite by means of a ratio method analysis ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . assuming a scaling form ( [ mbscal ] ) also for the number of contact maps ( cm ) ,",
    "a similar analysis yields @xmath43 , i.e. , their ( still ) exponential growth is slower than that of self  avoiding walks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    in the second enumeration step we determined all designing sequences of length @xmath38 ,",
    "their numbers are shown in table  [ tab_des ] . as the interaction is more complicated in the mhp case , it is intuitively clear that degeneracies are lifted and that there are hence more designing sequences for that model than in the hp case .",
    "we also note that there are fewer designing sequences in the hp model on the sc lattice than for the same model and the same lengths @xmath6 on the square lattice@xcite .",

    "in the first part of our exact enumeration procedure we generated the complete sets of contact maps for self  avoiding walks of @xmath47 steps , i.e.  for conformations of up to @xmath48 monomers .",
    "we parallelized our program such as to distribute the set of contact maps over several memory partitions of a linux cluster .",
    "in the second step of enumeration , we determined all designing sequences for both types of interactions considered . here , parallelization is used to decrease the required computer time .",
    "the results obtained this way can be used in a statistical analysis of designing sequences and their ground  state conformations .",
    "first , in the space of sequences , we can discuss the _ hydrophobicity _ , i.e. , the h  content of designing sequences as well as _ hydrophobicity profiles _ describing the distribution of hydrophobic monomers in the polymer chain .",

    "hydrophobic contact density profiles_. second , in the space of conformations , the data obtained herein allow for the study of the _ end  to  end distances _ and _ radii of gyration _ as measures of the compactness of designed conformations .",

    "finally , it should be pointed out that a slight variation of the enumeration procedure explained herein also allows for the _ exact _ determination of the density of states @xmath50 , i.e. , the number of conformations corresponding to all energy levels and not just to the ground  state energy .",
    "this number includes all symmetries which is why we store the degeneracies @xmath51 for all contact maps @xmath52 ( see section  [ ssec_cm ] ) . for a given hp sequence , @xmath50 can be used to determine the temperature dependence of energetic quantities , in particular that of the specific heat whose peaks can be associated with conformational transitions  @xcite .",
