    "dynamic stochasticity is directly connected with the assumption that classical equations of motion may contain nonlinearities which arise when the ( exponential ) repulsion of phase trajectories occurs at a sufficiently quick rate . in the case of quantum consideration , the dynamics of a system is described by a wave function that obeys a linear equation , while the notion of a trajectory is not used at all . hence , at first sight it seems problematic of find out the quantum properties of systems whose classical consideration reveals their dynamic stochasticity .",
    "a quantum analogue of classical stochastic motion is usually called quantum chaos .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is of practical interest to investigate parametrically dependent hamiltinians @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of canonical coordinates , @xmath2 is the parameter describing how the system is related to the external field .",
    "the interest in such systems is explained by their use in the study of quantum points and other problems of mesoscopic physics [ 1 ] .    in most of the papers that deal with parametrically dependent systems ,",
    "their authors consider the following situation . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath4 is exactly integrable .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , the hamiltonian @xmath0 becomes nonintegrable and , for a certan value of @xmath5 , solutions of the classical equations corresponding to @xmath6 become chaotic . in the case of quantum consideration , eigenvalues @xmath7 and eigenfunctions @xmath8",
    "are found in the above - mentioned area of parameter values by using the method of numerical diagonalization . in that case , we show interest in the dependence of the parametrical kernel @xmath9 on a parameter displacement @xmath10 .",
    "the value @xmath11 , averaged statistically over states @xmath12 , @xmath13 can be interpreted as the local density of states .",
    "the introduction of @xmath14 means that we pass from the quantum - mechanical description to the quantum statistical description [ 2 - 5 ] carried out by an intuitive reasoning .    in the problems considered in the above - listed papers , the hamiltonian @xmath0 displays chaos for both parameter values @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    as different from these papers ,",
    "in the present paper we investigate the situation , in which the hamiltonian @xmath0 is integrable and becomes nonintegrable after adding a strictly periodic perturbation @xmath17 . as the basic hamiltonian",
    "we take the hamiltonian of the mathematical pendulum ( universal hamiltonian ) .    as is known , the schrdinger quantum - mechanical equation for the universal hamiltonian is written in the form of the mathieu equation .",
    "the mathieu - schrdinger equation for an atom , which is under the action of optical pumping in the area of large quantum numbers , was for first time obtained by g. zaslavsky and g. berman [ 6 ] .",
    "these authors also performed analysis of quasiclassical states of the mathieu - schrdinger equation [ 6 ] .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to investigate the behavior of the quantum mathematical pendulum in the area of dynamic stochasticity parameters .",
    "as is known [ 7 ] , this area , called the stochastic layer , lies in the neighborhood of the separatrix of the classical pendulum .",
    "we show here that with the appearance of quantum chaos the pure state passes to the mixed one .",
    "in other words , the reversible quantum process transforms to the irreversible process of quantum chaos which can be described by a kinetic equation .",
    "the common feature of classical dynamic chaos and quantum chaos is , as will be shown below , the irreversibility of their states .",
    "after writing the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath18 for the universal hamiltonian of the atom+pumping system @xmath19 @xmath20 we come to the equation coinciding with the mathieu equation [ 8 , 9 ] @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the introduced dimensionless values , @xmath2 is the dimensionless amplitude of pumping , @xmath23 is the derivative of nonlinear oscillation frequency @xmath24 with respect to the action @xmath25 [ 9 ] .",
    "the mathieu - schrdinger equation is characterized by a specific dependence of the spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath26 and eigenfunctions @xmath27 on the parameter @xmath2 ( see fig.1 ) . on the plane @xmath28 with the spectral characteristics ( so - called mathieu characteristics [ 9 ] ) of the problem , this specific feature manifests itself in the alternation of areas of degenerate ( @xmath29 ) and nondegenerate ( @xmath30 ) states ( see [ 10 ] , figs.3 , 4 ) .",
    "the boundaries between these areas pass through the branch points of energy therms @xmath26 .",
    "degenerate and nondegenerate states of the quantum mathematical pendulum were established by studying the symmetry properties of the mathieu - schrdinger equation . in [ 10 ] , by using the symmetry properties of the mathieu - schrdinger equation and applying the group theory methods , the eigenvalues for each of the areas @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 were found : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 here @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the mathieu functions [ 9 ] .",
    "the wave functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 form the bases of irreducible representations of the respective groups .",
    "each of the four functions @xmath41 forms a one - dimensional irreducible representation of the klein group @xmath42 , while the functions @xmath43 from @xmath44 and @xmath45 from @xmath46 form the two - dimensional irreducible representations of two invariant subgroups of the group @xmath42 [ 10 ] .",
    "let us assume that the pumping amplitude is modulated by a slowly changing electromagnetic field .",
    "the influence of modulation can be taken into account by making a replacement in the mathieu - schrdinger equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the modulation amplitude expressed in dimensionless units , @xmath49 is the modulation frequency .",
    "we assume that a gradual change of @xmath50 may involve some @xmath51 branch points on the left and on the right side of the separatrix ( fig.1 ) : @xmath52 after making replacement ( 4 ) in the universal hamiltonian , we obtain @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    simple calculations show that the matrix elements of perturbation @xmath56 with respect to the wave functions @xmath41 of the nondegenerate area @xmath30 are equal to zero @xmath57 where @xmath12 is any integer number . therefore perturbation @xmath58 can not bring about passages between nondegenerate levels .",
    "the interaction @xmath56 , not producing passages between levels , should be inserted in the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian obtained in this manner can be considered as slowly depending on time .",
    "thus , in the nondegenerate area @xmath30 the hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath59",
    "@xmath60    as has been mentioned above , to different areas on the plane @xmath28 we can assign different eigenfunctions @xmath44 , @xmath41 , @xmath46 .",
    "because of the modulation of the parameter @xmath50 the system passes from one area to another , getting over the branch points .",
    "as different from the nondegenerate states area @xmath30 , in the areas of degenerate states @xmath32 and @xmath31 , the nondiagonal matrix elements of perturbation @xmath61 @xmath58 are not equal to zero .",
    "for example , if we take the matrix elements with respect to the wave functions @xmath62 ( see @xmath44 ) , then for the left degenerate area @xmath32 it can be shown that @xmath63 note that the value @xmath64 has order equal to the pumping modulation depth @xmath65    analogously to ( 9 ) , we can write an expression for even @xmath66 states as well .    an explicit dependence of @xmath61 on time given by the factor @xmath67 is assumed to be slow as compared with the period of passages between degenerate states that are produced by the nondiagonal matrix elements @xmath64 .",
    "therefore below the perturbation @xmath64 will be assumed to be the time - independent perturbation that can bring about passages between degenerate states .",
    "thus , in a degenerate area the system may be in the time - dependent superpositional state @xmath68 the probability amplitudes @xmath69 are defined by means of the fundamental quantum - mechanical equation expressing the casuality principle [ 11 ] .",
    "we write such equations for a pair of doubly degenerate states : @xmath70 @xmath71 let us solve system ( 11 ) . in our case it can be assumed that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "let us investigate changes that occurred in the state of the system during time @xmath74 while the system was in the area @xmath32 , assuming that @xmath74 is a part of the modulation period @xmath75",
    ".    for arbitrary initial values system ( 11 ) has the solution @xmath76 @xmath77 where we redenote @xmath78 .",
    "a slow dependence of the interaction @xmath61 ( 6 ) on time can be taken into account in ( 12 ) if we use the replacement @xmath79 .",
    "let motion begin from the state @xmath80 of the degenerate area .",
    "then as the initial conditions we take @xmath81    having substituted ( 13 ) into ( 12 ) , for the amplitudes @xmath82 we obtain @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the frequency of passages between degenerate states , @xmath86 is the passage time .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath87 , which is connected with the modulation depth @xmath48 , has ( like any other parameter ) a certain small error @xmath88 , which during the time of one passage @xmath89 , leads to an insignificant correction in the phase @xmath90 .",
    "but during the time @xmath91 , there occur a great number of oscillations ( phase incursion takes place ) and , in the case @xmath92 , a small error @xmath88 brings to the uncertainty of the phase @xmath93 which may have order @xmath94 .",
    "then we say that the phase is self - chaotized .",
    "let us introduce the densitity matrix averaged over a small dispersion @xmath88 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "the overline denotes the averaging over a small dispersion @xmath88 @xmath97    to solve ( 16 ) we can write that @xmath98    after a simple integration of the averaging ( 16 ) , for the matrix element ( 17 ) we obtain @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101    at small values of time @xmath102 , insufficient for self - chaotization @xmath103 , we obtain @xmath104    comparing these values with the initial values ( 17 ) of the density matrix elements , we see that the averaging procedure ( 16 ) , as expected , does not affect them .",
    "thus , for small times we have @xmath105    one can easily verify that matrix ( 19 ) satisfies the condition @xmath106 , which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the density matrix of the pure state .    for times even smaller than @xmath107 , when passages between degenerate states practically fail to occur , by taking the limit @xmath108 in ( 19 ) , we obtain the following relation for the density matrix : @xmath109 this relation corresponds to the initial relation ( 13 ) when the system is in the eigenstate @xmath80 .",
    "let us now investigate the behavior of the system at times @xmath110 when the system gets self - chaotized .",
    "on relatively large time intervals @xmath111 , in which the self - chaotization of phases takes place , for the matrix elements we should use general expressions ( 18 ) .",
    "the substitution of these expressions for the matrix elements ( 18 ) into the density matrix ( 15 ) gives @xmath112 hence , for times @xmath110 during which the phases get completely chaotized , after passing to the limit @xmath113 in ( 21 ) , we obtain @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an infinitesimal value of order @xmath116 .",
    "the state described by the density matrix ( 22 ) is a mixture of two quantum states @xmath117 and",
    "@xmath80 with equal weights .",
    "the comparison of the corresponding matrix elements of matrices ( 22 ) and ( 21 ) shows that they differ in the terms that play the role of quickly changing fluctuations . when the limit is @xmath118 , fluctuations decrease as @xmath119 ( see fig.2 and 3 ) .",
    "thus the system , which at the time moment @xmath120 was in the pure state with the wave function @xmath80 ( 20 ) , gets self - chaotized with a lapse of time @xmath118 and passes to the mixed state ( 22 ) . in other words , at the initial moment the system had a certain definite `` order '' expressed in the form of the density matrix @xmath121 ( 20 ) . with a lapse of time the system got self - chaotized and the fluctuation terms appeared in the density matrix ( 21 ) . for large times",
    "@xmath118 a new `` order '' looking like a macroscopic order is formed , which is defined by matrix ( 22 ) .    after a halfperiod the system passes to the area of nondegenerate states @xmath30 ( 20 ) . in passing through the branch point ,",
    "there arise nonzero probabilities for passages both to the state @xmath122 and to the state @xmath123 .",
    "both states @xmath117 and @xmath80 will contribute to the probability that the system will pass to either of the states @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "for the total probability of passage to the states @xmath122 and @xmath123 we obtain respectively @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 thus , in the nondegenerate area the mixed state is formed , which is defined by the density matrix @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 number two levels that correspond to the states @xmath122 and @xmath123 .    as follows from ( 24 ) , at this evolution stage of the system , the populations of two nondegenerate levels get equalized .",
    "it should be noted that though the direct passage ( 7 ) between the nondegenerate levels is not prohibited , perturbation ( 6 ) essentially influences `` indirect '' passages . under `` indirect '' passages we undestand a sequence of events consisting a passage @xmath131 through the branch point , a set of passages between degenerate states in the area @xmath32 , and the reverse passage through the branch point @xmath132 .",
    "the `` indirect '' passages ocurring during the modulation halfperiod @xmath133 result in the equalization ( saturation ) of two nondegenerate levels .    as to the nondegenerate area",
    ", the role of perturbation @xmath61 in it reduces to the displacement of the system from the left branch point to the right one .",
    "it is easy to verify that after states ( 24 ) pass to the states of the degenerate area @xmath31 , we obtain the mixed state which involves four states @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "let us now calculate the probability of four passages from the mixed state @xmath136 ( 22 ) to the states @xmath134 and @xmath137 : @xmath138 @xmath139    as a result of these passages , in the area @xmath31 we obtain the mixed state described by the four - dimensional density matrix @xmath140 where the indices of the density matrix ( 26 ) show that the respective matrix elements are taken with respect to the wave functions @xmath134 and @xmath135 of degenerate states of the area @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to foresee a further evolution course of the system . at each passage through the branch point , the probability that an energy level will get populated is equally divided between branched states .",
    "we can see the following regularity of the evolution of populations for the next time periods .",
    "after odd halfperiods , the population of any @xmath141th nondegenerate level is defined as an arithmetic mean of its population and the population of the nearest upper level , while after even halfperiods  as an arithmetic mean of its population and the nearest lower level .",
    "this population evolution rule can be represented both in the form of table 1 and in the form of recurrent relations @xmath142=p[n+1,2k]=\\frac{1}{2}(p[n,2k-1]+p[n+1,2k-1]),\\\\\\ ] ] @xmath143=p[n+2,2k+1]=\\frac{1}{2}(p[n+1,2k]+p[n+2,2k ] ) , \\label{27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 $ ] is the population value of the @xmath141th level after time @xmath145 , where @xmath130 is an integer number .",
    "the creeping of populations among nondegenerate levels is illustrated in fig.4 .",
    "the results of numerical calculations by means of formulas ( 27 ) are given in fig.5 and fig.6 .",
    "fig.5 shows the distribution of populations of levels @xmath146 after a long time @xmath147 when the population creeping occurs among levels , the number of which is not restricted by ( 5 ) .",
    "let us assume that at the initial time moment @xmath120 , only one @xmath148th level is populated with probability @xmath149 . according to the recurrent relations ( 27 ) , with a lapse of each period @xmath150 `` indirect '' passages will result in the redistribution of populations among the neighboring levels so that , after a lapse of time @xmath151 , populations of the extreme levels will decrease according to the law [ 10 ] @xmath152    if the number @xmath51 of levels defined by condition ( 5 ) is finite , then , after a lapse of a long time , passages will result in a stationary state in which all @xmath51 levels are populated with the same probability equal to @xmath153 ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "the distribution obtained by us is analogous to the distribution obtained in [ 12 , 13 ] in investigating the problem on a linear oscillator under the action of an electromagnetic field in the conditions of weak chaos .",
    "let us summarize the results we have obtained above using the notions of statistical physics .",
    "after a lapse of time @xmath74 , that can be called the time of initial chaotization , the investigated closed system ( quantum pendulum+variable field ) can be considered as a statistical system . at that , the closed system consists of two subsystems : the classical variable field ( 6 ) that plays the role of a thermostat with an infinitely high temperature and the quantum mathematical pendulum ( 6 ) . a weak ( indirect ) interaction of the subsystems produces passages between nondegenerate levels . after a lapse of time @xmath147",
    "this interaction ends in a statististical equilibrium between the subsystems . as a result , the quantum pendulum subsystem acquires the thermostat temperature , which in turn leads to the equalization of level populations .",
    "the equalization of populations usually called the saturation of passages can be interpreted as the acquisition of an infinite temperature by the quantum pendulum subsystem .",
    "as is known , variation or constancy of entropy can be considered as a criterion of irreversibility and reversibility of processes occurring in a closed system . in the case of irreversible processes ,",
    "during which the system tends to the equilibrium state , the entropy increases , while in the equilibrium state it remains constant .",
    "let us use this criterion to clarify the question of reversibility for our problem .",
    "as is known , the entropy of an arbitrary quantum system is defined by the operator of the density matrix @xmath154 [ 14 ] @xmath155 where the brackets @xmath156 denote the quantum - mechanical averaging , while the overline denote the averaging over a small dispersion @xmath88 of the passage frequency ( 9 ) . in the matrix form",
    "the right - hand side of formula ( 24 ) is written as @xmath157    if initially the system is in one of degenerate states , for example , in the pure state @xmath80 , then @xmath158 @xmath159 and therefore , by ( 29 ) , the entropy is @xmath160 .    with a lapse of time @xmath161 ,",
    "as passages between nondegenerate states are completed and the self - chaotization condition @xmath162 is fulfilled , the density matrix takes form ( 22 ) .",
    "then the substitution of the density matrix ( 22 ) into the entropy formula ( 29 ) gives @xmath163 thus , on a time interval from @xmath120 to @xmath164 , the entropy grows @xmath165 this proves that on this time interval the process is irreversible .    using analytical methods ,",
    "we have succeeded in establishing only the asymptotic value of entropy . to investigate a complete picture of entropy change on a time interval @xmath166 , we use expression ( 15 ) for @xmath167 . after substituting it into the entropy formula we obtain @xmath168",
    "fig.7 shows the entropy as a function of time constructed with the aid of ( 18 ) , ( 31 ) by numerical methods .    to calculate the entropy value with the lapse of one period @xmath150",
    ", we substitute matrix ( 26 ) into the entropy formula ( 29 ) and thus obtain @xmath169    the state , in which all accessible levels of the subsystem are populated with the same probability @xmath153 ( fig.6 ) , is the equilibrium state . the corresponding density matrix of dimension @xmath51 is written as @xmath170 after substituting @xmath136 from ( 32 ) into(29 ) , we obtain the maximal entropy value on time intervals @xmath147 @xmath171 thus we see that the entropy constantly grows up to value ( 33 ) and after that it stops to grow .",
    "let us now calculate the energy mean of the quantum pendulum subsystem .",
    "it is obvious that for the average energy of the subsystem we can write @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the initial energy value defined by the initial @xmath174 population of the levels , @xmath175 is the probability that the @xmath141th level will be populated at the time moment @xmath176 , @xmath177 is the energy value in the @xmath141th state defined from the area of nondegenerate states , in fig .",
    "8 we see that the subsystem energy first grows and then becomes constant .",
    "this result can be explained if we take into account the time dependent trend of population changes which is defined by the recurrent relations ( 27 ) or table 1 . at the beginning",
    "the subsystem absorbs the field energy @xmath58 and , in doing so , performs `` indirect '' passages between energy levels mostly in the upward direction . upon reaching the equilibrium state , in which the subsystem is characterized by the equalization of level populations",
    ", it stops to absorb energy .",
    "the classical mathematical pendulum may have two oscillation modes ( rotational and oscillatory ) which on the phase plane are separated by the separatrix ( see fig.9,a ) .    on the plane",
    "@xmath28 the quantum mathematical pendulum has two areas of degenerate states ",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "quantum states from the area @xmath32 possesses translational symmetry in the pendulum phase space .",
    "these states are analogous to the classical rotational mode .",
    "quantum states from the degenerate area @xmath31 possess symmetry with respect to the equilibrium state of the pendulum and therefore are analogous to the classical oscillatory state [ 10 ] . on the plane @xmath28 ,",
    "the area of nondegenerate states @xmath30 , which lies between the areas @xmath32 and @xmath31 , contains the line @xmath178 corresponding to the classical separatrix ( see fig.9,b ) .",
    "if the classical pendulum is subjected to harmonically changing force that perturbs a trajectory near to the separatrix , then the perturbed trajectory acquires such a degree of complexity that it can be assumed to be a random one .",
    "therefore we say that a stochastic motion layer ( so - called stochastic layer ) is formed in the neighborhood of the separatrix [ 7 ] ( see fig.10,a ) .    in the case of quantum consideration , the periodic perturbation ( 6 ) brings about passages between degenerate states . as a result of repeated passages , before passing to the area @xmath30 the system gets self - chaotized , passes from the pure state to the mixed one and further evolves irreversibly .",
    "while it repeatedly passes through the branch points , the redistribution of populations by the energy spectrum takes place .",
