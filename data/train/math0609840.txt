    "flag matroids are a subclass of coxeter matroids , but they can also be described in pure matroid - theoretical terms . roughly speaking ,",
    "a flag matroid is a collection of matroids on the same ground set that form a chain in the strong order ( i.e. , they are quotients of each other ) .",
    "flag matroids play an important role in the theory of coxeter matroids and also shed light on ordinary matroid theory .",
    "nevertheless , not many classes of flag matroids have been studied up to now .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce a new family of flag matroids based on an enumeration problem and show how these flag matroids can be interpreted in terms of lattice paths .",
    "we refer to  @xcite , especially to chapter  1 , for an introduction to flag matroids and the ideas behind them .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of matroid theory ; we follow the notation of oxley s book  @xcite .",
    "we recall here only the notion of quotient . given two matroids @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the same ground set , @xmath0 is a _ quotient _ of @xmath1 if every flat of @xmath0 is a flat of @xmath1 ( one can also say that @xmath0 is a strong map image of @xmath1 ) . in this case , the rank of @xmath0 is at most the rank of @xmath1 , with equality holding if and only if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equal .",
    "we also need to say a few words about lattice path matroids .",
    "we do not need lattice path matroids in general as defined in  @xcite , but only the subclass of nested matroids .",
    "these matroids have independently arisen several times in the literature since at least 1965 , and have been given a variety of names ; see  @xcite and the references therein for definitions and results ( in these papers , nested matroids are called `` generalized catalan matroids '' ) .",

    "hence , the bases of a nested matroid are in bijection with the lattice paths that do not go above a certain fixed path @xmath2 ( see the left side of figure  [ fig : tbpmat ] for an example of a nested matroid on the set @xmath16 $ ] ; the path highlighted corresponds to the basis @xmath17 ) .",
    "the name nested comes from the fact that a nested matroid can also be defined as a transversal matroid whose presentation consists of nested sets , and also because of the following characterization of nested matroids in terms of cyclic flats ( recall that a flat is _ cyclic _ if it is a union of circuits ) .",
    "[ thm : nested ] a matroid is nested if and only if its cyclic flats form a chain under inclusion .",

    "our view on flag matroids is slightly different from that of  @xcite , but it is easy to see that the two perspectives are equivalent .",
    "the definition in  @xcite is in terms of flags of sets , whereas ours relies on what we call ordered partitions of a set . for the reader already familiar with the theory of flag matroids ,",

    "the bound is strict since each @xmath324 counts the number of @xmath65-configurations of the @xmath74-tennis ball problem , but each of these can usually be reached by several movements of the balls and that is relevant for the version with @xmath21 bins .",
