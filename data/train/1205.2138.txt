    "the on - going search for new superheavy elements is motivated by the attempts to provide theoretical and experimental explanations for two open questions in nuclear structure .",
    "the first question is related to the limits of the existence of atomic nuclei at large values of proton number , while the second one to the location of the island of stability of superheavy nuclei and the next magic numbers ( if any ) beyond @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "heavy and superheavy nuclei decay by spontaneous fission and therefore their stability is defined essentially by the size and the shape of the fission barriers .",
    "thus , the inner fission barrier is considered a fundamental characteristic of these nuclei which is important in resolving the questions mentioned above .",
    "a systematic investigation of the properties of fission barriers is the best way to address the stability of nuclei against spontaneous fission since it eliminates the arbitrariness of conclusions with respect to the choice of a specific nucleus .",
    "different models with triaxiality included have been used for extensive theoretical investigations of the properties of inner fission barriers in the actinides .",
    "it has been found that the heights of inner fission barriers are reduced when triaxial shapes are taken into account @xcite .",
    "however , this reduction has a strong dependence on the particle number in the proton and neutron subsystems as well as on the applied model .",
    "these investigations were performed in the following frameworks : microscopic+macroscopic ( mm ) methods @xcite , the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral ( etfsi ) method @xcite , and non - relativistic energy density functionals ( edf ) based on zero - range skyrme @xcite and finite - range gogny @xcite forces , and recently in covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) @xcite .",
    "these methods have also been used for the study of fission barriers in superheavy nuclei ( see table [ tab4 ] below for a review ) . however , only few of them take into account triaxiality .",
    "for example , within the framework of covariant density functional theory , it has been considered only in the study of fission barriers in a single nucleus ( @xmath3hs ) in ref .",
    "thus , in order to fill this gap in our knowledge a systematic study of fission barriers of even - even @xmath0 superheavy nuclei with triaxiality included is performed in the current manuscript .",
    "we use the same method that has been successfully employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of inner fission barriers in actinides , where an average deviation from experiment of 0.76 mev has been found .",
    "when extrapolating to superheavy nuclei we want to understand the impact of triaxiality on fission barriers and how they evolve with the change of the particle numbers .",
    "an additional goal is to see how the fission barriers depend on the choice of the specific cdft model .",
    "while the systematic investigation of inner fission barriers of actinides in ref.@xcite has been performed with the nonlinear meson - nucleon coupling model represented by the nl3 * parametrization of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) lagrangian , in the current study we use in addition to the nonlinear coupling model also density - dependent meson - nucleon and point coupling models .",
    "density functional theories are extremely useful for the microscopic description of quantum mechanical many - body systems .",
    "they have been applied with great success for many years in coulombic systems  @xcite , where they are in principle exact and where the functional can be derived without any phenomenological adjustments directly from the coulomb interaction . in nuclear physics with spin and isospin degrees of freedom , with strong nucleon - nucleon and three - body forces the situation is much more complicated . however",
    ", covariant density functionals exploit basic properties of qcd at low energies , in particular symmetries and the separation of scales  @xcite .",
    "they provide a consistent treatment of the spin degrees of freedom , they include the complicated interplay between the large lorentz scalar and vector self - energies induced on the qcd level by the in - medium changes of the scalar and vector quark condensates  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these functionals include _ nuclear magnetism _",
    "@xcite , i.e. a consistent description of currents and time - odd mean fields important for odd - mass nuclei @xcite , the excitations with unsaturated spins , magnetic moments @xcite and nuclear rotations @xcite .",
    "because of lorentz invariance no new adjustable parameters are required for the time - odd parts of the mean fields . of course , at present , all attempts to derive these functionals directly from the bare forces  @xcite do not reach the required accuracy . however , in recent years modern and very successful covariant density functionals have been derived  @xcite which are based on density dependent vertices and one additional parameter characterizing the range of the force .",
    "they provide an excellent description of ground states and excited states all over the periodic table  @xcite with a high predictive power .",
    "modern versions of these forces derive the density dependence of the vertices from state - of - the - art ab - initio calculations and use only the remaining few parameters for a fine tuning of experimental masses in finite spherical  @xcite and deformed  @xcite nuclei .",

    "three classes of covariant density functional models are used throughout this manuscript : the nonlinear meson - nucleon coupling model ( nl ) , the density - dependent meson - exchange model ( dd - me ) and a density - dependent point coupling model ( dd - pc ) .",
    "the main differences between them lay in the treatment of the range of the interaction , the mesons and density dependence .",
    "the interaction in the first two classes has a finite range , while the third class uses zero - range interaction with one additional gradient term in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "the mesons are absent in the density - dependent point coupling model .",

    "the current calculations show that in many nuclei this barrier is appreciable in the axial calculations of type a. however , the inclusion of triaxial or octupole deformation decreases this barrier substantially so it is around 2 mev in the majority of the nuclei .",
    "this low barrier would translate into a high penetration probability for spontaneous fission , such that most likely these superdeformed states are metastable .",
    "calculations of the spontaneous fission half - lives from spherical / weakly - deformed and superdeformed minima are needed in order to decide which of these minima is more stable against fission .",
    "table [ sd - summary ] shows that the saddle point obtained in octupole deformed calculations ( o ) is the lowest in energy in most of the cases . only in proton - rich @xmath169120 and @xmath185118 nuclei ,",
    "the saddle point of triaxial calculations ( t ) is the lowest .    a superdeformed minimum exists also in the doubly magic nucleus @xmath100120 at a low excitation energy of approximately 0.6 mev ( see fig.[pot ] ) .",
    "this is definitely not an artifact of the model under consideration , since similar minimum exists also in axial relativistic hartree - bogoliubov calculations with the dd - me2 parametrization with gogny d1s forces in the pairing channel ( see fig .  8 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "its calculated excitation energy depends on the actual strength of pairing and varies between 0 and 2 mev .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results for the structure of the outer fission barriers with those obtained in the axial rmf+bcs model ( with and without reflection symmetry ) of ref .",

    "however , in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite with the nl - z2 parametrization , the heights of outer fission barriers with respect to the sd minimum are lower by approximately 2 mev as compared to our calculations . as a consequence ,",
    "the inclusion of octupole deformation completely eliminates the outer fission barriers leading to results contradicting ours . on the other hand , the results of the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  6 in this reference ) for a few selected nuclei based on the nl3 parametrization are very similar to ours , namely , the ground state is superdeformed and the outer fission barrier has a height of approximately 2.5 mev .",
    "this result is not surprising considering that the nl3 * parametrization is very similar to nl3 @xcite .",
    "however , the results of the calculations for a few selected @xmath150 and 116 nuclei shown in figs .  [ pot3a ] and [ pot3b ]",
    "reveal that the outer fission barriers survive in the presence of octupole and triaxial deformation not only in the nl3 * parametrization but also in the dd - me2 and dd - pc1 parametrizations . on average ,",
    "the height of outer fission barrier in these nuclei is around 2 mev . on the contrary , the calculations with the nl - z2 parametrization in ref .",
