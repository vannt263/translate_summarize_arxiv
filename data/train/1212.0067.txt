    "smart energy control in low - dimensional nanoscale systems is of both theoretical and practical importance , rendering the emergence of phononics @xcite , where various functional thermal devices are designed for managing thermal energy and information at nanoscale .",
    "as is well known , according to the second law of thermodynamics , energy can not transfer from a cold reservoir to a hot side spontaneously without external modulation . in order to obtain a more flexible control of thermal energy at the nanoscale",
    ", there is a great demand for designing intriguing phononic thermal devices , which can utilize temporal modulations to achieve dynamic control , such as in heat pumps , motors and engines .",
    "so far , many proposals have been provided to dynamically control the energy flow between a cold reservoir and a hot one @xcite . as a result of these investigations @xcite",
    ", there is no way to pump the energy from the cold side to the hot side in classical - oscillator systems by force driving , though heat pump can be implemented in classical spin chains @xcite . an interesting design to realize the dynamic control of heat transfer utilizes the adiabatic geometric phase effect @xcite .",
    "similar to the geometric phase in a closed quantum system under adiabatic drivings , when an open system with reservoirs is subjected to time - dependent modulations , the energy transfer will also gain such a geometric - phase - induced additional energy flux @xcite .",
    "the previous study of geometric heat flux in a spin - boson model adopted the redfield weak - coupling scheme @xcite .",
    "there are many approximation methods in studying the heat transfer in the spin - boson model @xcite . among them ,",
    "the redfield weak - coupling approximation is often used since this method is effective @xcite .",
    "the physical picture described by the redfield weak - coupling scheme has two inherent assumptions .",
    "one is the _ resonant tunneling _ between the system and the reservoirs , and only the resonant frequency in the reservoir contributes to the dynamics .",
    "the other is that each individual reservoir interacts with the system _ separately _ , or say , _",
    "additively_.    however , recent studies reveal that there are also limitations to the redfield - weak coupling scheme @xcite . besides the scheme",
    ", other methods such as the multilayer multiconfiguration hartree @xcite and the noninteracting - blip approximation ( niba ) @xcite are also applied to study the heat flow in a spin - boson model under temperature bias @xcite .",
    "particularly , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the heat current is not linearly dependent on the system - reservoir coupling strength as given by the redfield weak - coupling scheme",
    ". there exists a maximal heat current at the intermediate system - reservoir coupling regime , and then the heat current decreases in the strong system - reservoir coupling regime .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the niba scheme to study the geometric phase - induced energy transfer in a spin - boson model .",
    "distinct from the redfield scheme , niba is well known as a scheme accommodating the strong system - reservoir coupling .",
    "it describes another different physical scenario of transport @xcite : _ nonresonant _ tunneling between the system and the reservoirs , and the _ collective nonadditive _ interacting between reservoirs .",
    "we shall first review the analytical expressions of the investigated spin - boson model in niba and the geometric phase induced energy transfer through the generating function approach .",
    "we then investigate in detail the behaviors of geometric heat flux under various modulation protocols .",
    "our contributions are twofold .",
    "first , through calculating the geometric phase induced heat flux in unbiased ( degenerate ) case , we find zero geometric heat flux for niba method here , which is different from the finite geometric heat flux for redfield scheme @xcite .",
    "although , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that even in the weak coupling limit , niba method agrees very well with redfield calculation of heat flux , we can see that they still describe distinct ( ( non)-resonant and ( non)-additive ) physical pictures for nonequilibrium energy transfer in the spin - boson model .",
    "our results indicate that the geometric heat flux is a sensitive indicator for different physical pictures of transfer dynamics , which renders geometric heat flux could become an effective tool to compare the difference or even judge the correctness of various approximation schemes .",
    "second , geometric heat flux itself is a very important physical problem .",
    "a thorough investigation into the problem with different control protocols is meaningful .",
    "we find that geometric heat flux under two - temperature modulations is linearly increasing with the system - bath coupling strength for the biased ( nondegenerate ) case .",
    "for the modulation of one temperature and the two - level energy gap , we also observe a similar increase of the geometric heat flux with the system - bath coupling .",
    "this is useful because the dynamic heat flux always decays in the strong system - bath coupling limit , so the geometric heat flux will dominate the energy transfer in that strong - coupling limit and will have detectable consequences . moreover , we find the direction of geometric heat flux can be reversed by adjusting the system s parameters , in addition to reversing the modulation protocol . finally , two - coupling - modulation - induced geometric heat flux is identified .",
    "so far , this nontrivial observation is exclusive for quantum transport in the strong system - bath coupling regime .",
    "the nonequilibrium spin - boson ( nesb ) model , consisting of a two - level system in contact with two bosonic reservoirs with temperatures @xmath0 , is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy gap of the two levels ; @xmath3 denotes the tunneling between them ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the pauli matrices expressed in the two level basis ; @xmath6 denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the @xmath7th harmonic mode in the @xmath8 bosonic bath , with @xmath9 the system - bath coupling strength . before proceeding to the energy transport calculations , it is useful to transform the nesb hamiltonian ( [ eq : h1 ] ) by using the canonical transformation @xcite ( also called lang - firsov or polaron transformation ) : @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 . after neglecting an irrelevant constant @xmath13 ,",
    "the transformed hamiltonian is expressed as : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 clearly shows that the energy transfer is accomplished by the excitation from the lower level to the upper one with absorbing energy from the baths , and the relaxation from the upper level to the lower one with releasing energy to the baths . thereafter , as a result of the niba method @xcite and with the markov assumption , the population dynamics of the two - level system becomes @xcite : @xmath18 where , @xmath19 denotes the population at the lower ( upper ) level .",
    "the transition rates stand for the cooperative process between the system and two reservoirs : @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the probability density of the bath @xmath8 to absorb the energy @xmath22 ( equivalently , to release the energy @xmath23 ) . employing the gaussian statistics of the `` momentum '' operator @xmath24",

    "in contrast to the redfield - weak coupling scheme @xcite , the rate expressions ( [ eq : rates ] ) distinctly exhibit the non - resonant energy tunneling processes , conjoining the two baths nonadditively : @xmath27 means when the central system loses energy @xmath28 by relaxing from the upper level to the lower one , the @xmath29 bath will absorb @xmath22 and the @xmath30 bath gains the rest if @xmath31 or even supplements the shortage if @xmath32 ; @xmath33 depicts a similar energy transfer process for the central system exciting from the lower level to the upper one .",
    "following the _ full counting statistics _",
    "@xcite , we next construct the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) of the nesb model to count the phonon energy transfer through the right system - bath coupling @xcite .",
    "denote @xmath34 as the joint probability that a total energy of @xmath22 has been transferred to the right bath during time interval @xmath35 $ ] , with the two - level system populates at state @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) at time @xmath38 , we then introduce the characteristic function of that joint probability @xmath39 with the energy counting field @xmath40 .",

    "the mean value of the heat flux is just the first order : @xmath49    behaviors in the long - time limit are of our central interest .",
    "they are governed by the ground state of the operator @xmath50 , of which the eigenvalue @xmath51 possesses the the smallest real part . for time - independent @xmath50 , @xmath52 and in turn @xmath53",
    "however , for time - dependent @xmath54 , where the system parameters @xmath55 , the bath temperature @xmath56 or the system - bath coupling @xmath57 could be subject to periodic modulations , the adiabatic geometric phase effect has been unraveled to play an important role in the dynamic control of energy transfer @xcite . in this case , although at every instant the dynamics ( [ eq : me2 ] ) is preserved , there exist two contributions in the cgf : @xmath58 .",
    "one is the dynamic part @xmath59 , and the other is the geometric part @xmath60 @xcite : @xmath61 with @xmath62 the modulating period @xcite and @xmath63 the bi - orthonormal right ( left ) eigenvector corresponding to the ground state of @xmath54 @xcite . in the case of two parameters",
    "being modulated , say @xmath64 , the calculation of @xmath60 can be done using stokes theorem @xcite , @xmath65 and the berry curvature @xcite is : @xmath66 with @xmath67 the eigenvalue of the excited state and @xmath68 the corresponding bi - orthonormal right ( left ) eigenvector . according to these formulas",

    "the niba method is not equivalent to the redfield one .",
    "they describe distinct physical pictures of the transport dynamics .",
    "redfield scheme describes the physical picture in the weak coupling limit , which has two inherent assumptions : 1 ) resonant tunneling , and 2 ) additive reservoir effect .",
    "however , niba usually works in the strong coupling regime and describes another different physical picture of transport : 1 ) off - resonant tunneling , and has 2 ) non - additive reservoir effect .",
    "these differences between the niba and redfield methods give rise to the different results of geometric heat flux .",

    "the two different faces are not in conflict with each other .",
    "they are just two different manifestations of the same system under different scenarios and conditions .    rigorously speaking ,",
    "the niba method was originally derived for a spin coupled to a single equilibrium bosonic reservoir .",
    "consequently its theoretical justification for weak - coupling with zero bias @xcite is merely applied for the case of a single bath , where there is no difference between additive and non - additive reservoir effect . although ref .",

    "this in fact reflects the two distinct physical pictures described by these two methods @xcite .",
    "a larger deviation can be found in the shot - noise comparison in fig .",
