    "the fabrication of solid state quantum computing devices involves both the ability to manipulate mater at the nanoscale @xcite and to design structures that interact according to prescribed quantum computing hamiltonians@xcite . tuning and controlling quantum interactions are basic problems faced by the quantum computing community .",
    "this requires engineering the structure of electronic wave functions in different environments and conditions .",
    "the manipulation of individual atoms with stm has made possible the construction of arbitrary quantum structures on top of surfaces .",
    "in particular , after the seminal work of crommie et al.@xcite , it has been possible to build _ quantum corrals _ of arbitrary shape , placing atoms one at a time .",
    "quantum corrals are a collection of atoms arranged in a controlled manner on top of a metallic surface .",
    "these novel structures generate quantum confinement of the surface conduction electron wave functions leading to striking phenomena such as resonant electronic states and the formation of _ quantum mirages _ @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "quantum mirages are the projection of a perturbation on a point into another distant point of the surface .",
    "manoharan et al.@xcite were able to partially project the kondo @xcite electronic structure up to @xmath0 away from the actual kondo impurity . in these experiments ,",
    "the formation of a kondo mirage relies on the focusing properties of elliptical corrals .",
    "these findings triggered a collection of theoretical papers modeling@xcite and extending the concept of quantum mirages@xcite .",
    "this new phenomenon has been proposed as a tool for remote probing @xcite and as a way to enhance @xcite the interaction between localized magnetic impurities on a surface .",
    "unfortunately , the design of quantum corrals with certain desired properties is still a matter of trial and error@xcite .",
    "we think that both technological applications and novel physical phenomena could emerge if one could tailor the electronic wave functions that are responsible for the quantum mirage formation . for that purpose",
    "we believe that new systematic methods to design quantum corrals are required .",
    "in previous works it was shown that the magnetic interaction between magnetic impurities can be strongly enhanced due to the electronic confinement produced by quantum corrals@xcite .",
    "our present objective is to generate the optimal geometrical arrangement of quantum corral atoms that achieves an arbitrary predefined quantum mechanical interaction .",
    "this type of problem is usually denoted as _",
    "inverse problem_. in contrast to the _ direct problem _ , where a physical property is the result of the geometry of the material , in the _ inverse problem _ the optimized geometry is a result of the physical property targeted .",
    "inverse problems have been addressed in a variety of systems ranging from band gaps of solids @xcite , design of antennas@xcite , or intermolecular potential fitting@xcite . in order to solve the inverse problem one needs two ingredients : i )  a fast method to solve the direct problem ( i.e. electron gas response for a given corral configuration ) ii )  an efficient algorithm to select new configurations and optimize the structure to achieve the target properties .    in this paper",
    "we address the ` inverse quantum corral problem ' .",

    "ii )  our theory allow us to design quantum corrals that are particularly sensitive to the values of the phase shift , the only free parameter of the model .",
    "we show that it is possible to design structures that can be used to measure this phase shift .",
    "we consider quantum corrals on the cu(111 ) surface .",
    "cu atoms on this surface form a triangular lattice with spacing @xmath1 .",
    "this underlying triangular lattice defines also a triangular lattice for the equilibrium positions of the impurities that form the corral .",
    "the electronic structure of cu(111 ) consist of a surface band with a fermi energy @xmath2 laying @xmath3 above the bottom of this band .",
    "we will treat the surface band as a two - dimensional - electron gas in the effective mass approximation .",
    "there is broad consensus @xcite that the quantum mirages form as a result of the interplay between the impurities at the surface and this two dimensional surface band .",
    "several types of impurity atoms have been used to construct quantum corrals , examples are fe @xcite and co @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the fermi wave length of the electrons in the surface band is much larger than the spatial extension of the perturbation introduced by a single impurity atom .",
    "therefore , an s - wave scattering approximation is good enough for the description of the electronic scattering by the impurities@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the impurities that form the corral are described by a single parameter being the s - wave phase shift @xmath4 .    for the case of @xmath5 scatters located at positions @xmath6 the retarded green function @xmath7 of the system",

    "equation ( [ eq : g ] ) provides a straightforward way to obtain the exact green function after an @xmath18 matrix inversion .",

    "the integral of equation ( [ eq : c ] ) comes from states near the fermi energy@xcite , i.e. from @xmath44 $ ] @xcite . for the sake of avoiding the time consuming integration of eq .",

    "we exploit the fact that the correlation @xmath47 can be controlled by changing the shape of the quantum corral , i.e. the rkky interaction can be controlled by the quantum corral design .",
    "also , this correlation function ( 8) can be shown to be proportional to the perturbation in the @xmath48 at point @xmath30 produced by a non magnetic impurity located at @xmath49 [ @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , to linear order , the search of magnetic mirages in the spin density is the same than the search of mirages in @xmath51 ; extending the scope of this work to the case where the perturbation is non magnetic but still localized in space .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 impurities can fit in a lattice with spacing @xmath52 , and we restrict them to a square with side @xmath53 .",
    "the total number of possible configurations ( including open geometries ) is the combinatorial @xmath54 . for a typical system of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to study all these configurations within reasonable times .",
    "moreover , in the case of quantum corrals , most measurable quantities are expected to be non - smooth - multiple - valley functions of the @xmath59 coordinates of the impurities due to the appearance and disappearance of resonant states for different configurations of the quantum corral ( usually close - shaped corrals produce sharp resonances at discrete energies@xcite ) .",
    "therefore with a simple relaxation scheme , the system may be trapped in local minima of the multiple - valley function .",
    "accordingly , more sophisticated non deterministic methods are required .    in spite of this large number of configurations , for most practical applications it is possible to avoid covering all the configuration space .",
    "at the same time , it is possible to find good enough solutions than can be improved systematically .",
    "the simulated annealing algorithm @xcite is a quite general method to obtain minima of complicated functions of a large number of variables . in order to use a simulated annealing method",
    "we must define first a cost function @xmath60 .",
    "the cost function is simply a mathematical expression that quantifies the desired physical properties of the system ; being minimum when the target is reached and maximum if undesired properties are present .",
    "accordingly , the cost functions used in this work depend on one or more correlation functions .",
    "several examples will be discussed in the applications below .    once the cost function @xmath60 is defined and a random initial configuration is chosen , the simulated annealing algorithm consists@xcite in generating _ random trial steps _ and accepting them with a probability chosen following the metropolis algorithm : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is",
    "the change on the cost function in the trial step and @xmath63 is a _",
    "fictitious temperature_. at each trial step the coordinates of the atoms of the corral are allowed to move in a triangular lattice representing the cu(111 ) surface . in the annealing algorithm",
    "this _ metropolis dynamics _ is repeated while @xmath63 is gradually reduced@xcite .",
    "this process allows the system to sample the space of variables , staying longer times near better global minimum as @xmath63 diminishes . at @xmath64 ,",
    "only favorable ( @xmath65 ) steps are allowed to take place but at finite @xmath63 the system has the opportunity to escape from local minima .",
    "eventually , if the fictitious temperature decreases slowly enough , the result will be a global or at least a good minimum .",
    "a particular property of the present system is , however , that for some parameters , as the quality of the minimum increases , the amplitude of the barriers grows .",
    "therefore , rather than reducing the temperature , we smoothly adjust it continuously so as to maintain a target number of accepted changes .",
    "this implies that , in our case , as the cost function improves , the temperature rises .",
    "finally , instead of reducing the fictitious temperature , as in the general simulated annealing case , we slowly reduce the target of accepted changes@xcite .",
    "the rate of this reduction and how to define a cost function for a particular problem is in general a matter of trial and error and is not unique .",
    "several examples for different situations will be given .",
    "due to the presence of resonances , the performance of the simulated annealing decreases as better solutions are found or as a more complicated cost functions are introduced .",
    "since we are actually looking for a big resonance , we have to consider a complementary method to optimize the configurations further . in order to further improve the optimization we combined simulated annealing with another monte carlo technique which is sometimes more robust , a _ genetic algorithm_@xcite .",
    "the genetic algorithm is a learning model which derives from an analogy with _ evolution _ process in nature .    in our case , for the quantum corral problem",
    ", we have designed a genetic algorithm that starts with a _ population _ of different corral configurations , termed _",
    "individuals_. in order to use genetic algorithms , one must define also a cost function ( that we choose to be the same one used in the simulated annealing ) .",
    "the proposed cost function is evaluated for each individual of the population .",
    "the evaluation of each individual determines its probability to survive to the next _",
    "generation_. statistically only the fittest ( lowest cost function ) are chosen to survive , those which are eliminated are replaced by the _ offspring _",
    "resulting from mating survivors . in our case , we constructed the configuration of the corrals of the offspring as a random combination of the configurations of the corrals of the surviving parents .",
    "accordingly , the offprings keep geometrical similarities with their parents . in the general case of a genetic algorithm ,",
    "a random mutation@xcite is applied to the offspring in order to maintain diversity in the population . in our case , we replace this random mutation step by a simulated annealing step for each individual described above .",
    "we record the configuration of each individual that reaches the lowest cost during the simulated annealing step and use it for the next iteration .",
    "this combined process allows us to move continuously from a pure simulated annealing to a pure genetic algorithm depending on the number of individuals in the genetic algorithm and temperature and steps in the simulated annealing .",
    "once a new population of quantum corrals is generated , the process starts again retaining the fittest and eliminating the rest .",

    "guided by intuition we may think ( as many of us did ) that the ellipse was the optimum shape for a corral to enhance a perturbation of an impurity located at one focus of the ellipse into the other focus .",
    "this intuitive though originates in an analogy with geometrical optics@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the analogy is valid only partially because of the following reasons : i )  for the characteristic length scales of quantum corrals , geometrical optics is not completely valid and non trivial effects can arise from multiple scattering and purely quantum interference ; ii )  the impurities can not be freely placed on the surface , there is always an underlying lattice ( e.g. triangular for cu(111 ) ) that restricts the possible locations of the corral atoms .",
    "this restriction can have non negligible consequences as pointed out in ref .",
    "iii )  there is no theoretical proof that the ellipse is the optimal configuration of corral atoms , furthermore , the exact shape could depend on the particular phase shift model chosen , i.e. on the specific nature of the corral atoms .    given these facts , the following question arises : is there any better atomic configuration than the elliptical one ?    to test our method in this simple case , the simulated annealing algorithm was instructed to maximize the quantity @xmath66 , i.e. to project a perturbation from @xmath67 to @xmath68 as efficiently as possible .",

    "this contrasts with the evenly spaced atoms of the early experimental setups @xcite .",
    "a second shell of impurities appears to be more efficient than a single shell to confine the electron gas and produces better mirages .    for comparison",
    "we have studied the family of con - focal ellipses that can be formed with the same number of equidistant impurities ( being the perturbation at one focus and the mirage at the other ) .",

    "as for a different model ( i.e. a real phase shift ) we would find a different way to fit the same data : we need at least two measurements to verify the validity of a model with a single free parameter . in figure",
    "[ fig : measureps ] ( black line ) we plot @xmath134 when there is an additional impurity at @xmath124 as a function of a common phase shift @xmath11 .",
    "the value of @xmath134 also increases monotonically with @xmath11 but saturates earlier ( around @xmath135 ) .",
    "note that the difference between the two mirages can be of the order of 20 % of the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "therefore , we believe that the contribution of a single impurity can be measured within experimental resolution , providing alternative data to corroborate the present surface scattering model .    finally , let us characterize this double mirage structure as an experimental device to measure surface scattering cross sections or phase shifts of arbitrary impurities .",
    "let us assume that the surface of cu is doped mainly with type one atom ( lets say co ) but also that there are additional minority impurities on the surface available .",
    "let us say that we are not even sure what is the phase shift of our majority impurity .",
    "the following question arises : is this quantum corral made of impurities of unknown phase shift good enough to estimate the phase shifts of any other impurity ? .",
    "the doted lines lines in figure [ fig : measureps ] have been drawn assuming that the impurities of the corral have a phase shift @xmath11 of 0.5 1 and 2 as a function of the phase shift @xmath136 of a _ different _ the impurity in @xmath124 and a perturbation with phase shift @xmath11 at @xmath67 .",
    "we see that @xmath134 is quite insensitive to the phase shift of the impurities of the corral , suggesting that only the geometry chosen for confinement determines @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , a single quantum corral device can be used to `` measure '' the phase shift of every impurity in the periodic table in spite of the uncertainly in the knowledge of the phase shift of the impurities in the corral .",
    "note finally , that the cost function was build such that the corral was very sensitive to small perturbations at @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , our proposed `` experimental device '' is very sensitive to small phase shifts and saturates faster for larger ones than the amplitude of the mirages ( see inset ) .",
    "alternatively one might have chosen a different cost function to selectively measure higher vales of @xmath136 .",
