    "since the 1990s , ngc  6388 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and ngc  6441 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) have been considered as `` twin '' clusters because of many common features .",
    "they are both located in the bulge of our galaxy , they are two of the most luminous and massive ( @xmath211.6@xmath210@xmath22 m@xmath23 , pryor & meylan 1993 ) globular clusters ( gcs ) of the milky way , and they are both metal rich ( [ fe / h]=@xmath240.55 for ngc  6388 and [ fe / h]=@xmath240.46 for ngc  6441 , harris 1996 , 2010 edition ) . despite their high metal content , their most intriguing common property is an extended blue horizontal branch ( hb , rich et al .",
    "1997 ) , which makes them among the most extreme examples of the so - called second - parameter problem .",
    "moreover , the red clump ( rc ) of the hb is noticeably tilted , with bluer stars being brighter ( in the optical bands ) than redder ones ( raimondo et al .",
    "2002 ) .    since the work of rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , attempts to understand what is special about these two clusters have focused on these two peculiarities .",
    "sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) first proposed high helium as the origin of the blue hb extension , in a scenario in which the envelope of fast - rotating stars , while ascending the red giant branch ( rgb ) , would be enriched in helium by meridional currents .",
    "others , focusing on the hb tilt , argued for differential reddening ( dr ) as the cause of the tilt itself ( e.g. , raimondo et al .",
    "2002 ) , but even though these clusters are certainly affected by dr , the size of the tilt is too large to be explained by dr alone , and finally , dr has been excluded by busso et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who found that the hb tilt persisted in all parts of their field , in each of the two clusters .",
    "it became evident that traditional evolutionary scenarios could not account for the properties of these two clusters following the discovery that their rr lyrae variables have exceptionally long periods ( something that could be explained by high helium but certainly not by dr ) . with an average fundamental - mode period of @xmath25 for ngc  6388 , and @xmath26 for ngc  6441 ,",
    "these two clusters were legitimately considered to be the prototype of a third oosterhoff type ( the average periods of oosterhoff i and oosterhoff ii clusters being @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , layden et al .",
    "1999 ; pritzl et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the discovery of multiple stellar populations with enhanced helium in several gcs ( see piotto 2009 for a recent review ) offers a new perspective for understanding the many apparent anomalies that these two clusters share .",
    "after it was shown that high helium could be the cause of both the blue hb extension and the unusual period of the rr lyrae ( dantona & caloi 2004 ; caloi & dantona 2007 ; busso et al.2007 ) , the question became whether high helium was the result of deep - mixing in a minority of rgb stars ( as originally suggested by sweigart & catelan 1998 ) , or was due to the presence of a second , helium - enriched stellar population . in the former case no splitting of the main sequence ( ms ) was expected , whereas a sizable split should exist if the blue hb and rr lyrae stars belong to a distinct , helium - rich sub - population .",
    "evidence for different stellar generations has already been found in both clusters with the detection of light - element star - to - star variations and the na  o anticorrelation ( gratton et al .",
    "2007 ; carretta et al .",
    "2007 , 2009a ) .",
    "moreover , ngc  6388 also exhibits a split sub - giant branch ( sgb , piotto 2008 ; moretti et al .",
    "2009 ; piotto et al .",
    "thus , if the blue hb and rr lyrae stars belong to helium - enriched populations in these clusters , we should be able to see the effect of enhanced he on the mss ( a spread or a split ) , to quantify the enhancement , and to check whether it is consistent with the amount of helium enhancement required to account for the hb properties .    to this end",
    ", we submitted a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) proposal ( go-11739 , pi g. piotto ) to perform accurate photometry of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we combine go-11739 data with a large set of archival images from the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , in order to thoroughly map the multiple stellar populations of these two clusters from their ms all the way to the sgb , rgb and hb .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  in section  2 the vast set of _ hst _ data used for the project is presented , along with the reduction procedures . in section  3",
    "distinct stellar populations are identified in all the color - magnitude - diagram ( cmd ) sequences of the two clusters , and in section  4 their radial distributions within the clusters are presented . in section  5",
    "we estimate the the amount of helium enhancement @xmath29 required to account for the size of the ms split , and discuss its implications at the light of our new observational findings .",
    "this work is based on proprietary and on archival _ hst _ images .",
    "we made use of exposures taken with three different cameras :  ( 1 ) acs , with both the wide - field channel and the high - resolution channel ( wfc and hrc ) ; ( 2 ) wfc3 , with both the ultraviolet - visible ( uvis ) and the infrared ( ir ) channels ;  and ( 3 ) wfpc2 .",
    "a list of the observations is given in table  1 for ngc  6388 and in table  2 for ngc  6441 .",
    "to summarize briefly :  acs / wfc observations come from programs snap-9821 , go-10775 and go-11739 for ngc  6388 ; from go-10775 and go-11739 for ngc  6441 . acs / hrc observations are from programs go-9835 , go-10350 , and go-10474 .",
    "wfpc2 exposures come from go-5667 , go-8251 , and go-8718 .",
    "much of our material is archival , but as an essential part of this study we specifically designed the new program go-11739 ( pi :  piotto ) to detect multiple stellar populations along the mss of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 by exploiting the power of the new wfc3 cameras .",
    "we used both wfc3/uvis and wfc3/ir , in each case taking parallel exposures with acs / wfc .",
    "figure  1 shows the footprints of all exposures that are listed in tables  1 and 2 , superimposed on stars from the 2mass @xmath30-band catalog .",
    "a distinctive color is used for each program and a distinctive shape and size for each camera .",
    "figure  1 and tables 1 and 2 are crucial for this paper , as they exhibit the overlaps of the different data sets , which govern much of what follows .",
    "careful study of the figure , along with the tables , will enable the reader to see possible filter combinations that can be used to build cmds at different radial locations in the clusters .",
    "moreover , since some overlapping data sets encompass different epochs , one can see where proper motions are measurable , information that will prove invaluable for selection of cluster members .",
    "the reader should particularly note , for each cluster , the overlap between go-11739 and go-10775 ( much smaller for ngc  6388 than for ngc  6441 ) .    in this paper we will focus our attention on the more central fields , leaving the analysis of the outer fields to a later paper .",
    "this choice will not affect our results , since the outer field has been imaged only with filters not designed to highlight the multi - population phenomenon along the ms of these two clusters .",
    "moreover , the outer field does not have enough rgb and sgb stars for a study of their radial distribution .",
    "all acs / wfc ` _ flt ` images ( i.e. , images that were dark- and bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , but not resampled ) were corrected for charge - transfer deficiencies by using the procedure and the software developed by anderson & bedin ( 2010 ) .",
    "photometry and astrometry were carried out with the software tools described by anderson et al .",
    "briefly , all exposures belonging to a specific program were analyzed simultaneously to generate an astrophotometric catalog of stars in the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "stars were measured independently in each image by using the spatially varied point - spread function ( psf ) library models from anderson & king ( 2006b ) , along with a spatially constant perturbation specifically derived for each exposure , to compensate for small focus changes due to spacecraft `` breathing '' .",
    "star positions were corrected for geometric distortion using anderson & king ( 2006b ) and anderson ( 2007 ) .",
    "photometry was calibrated into the vega - mag flight system following recipes in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and using the zero points given in sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    the measurement of stellar fluxes and positions in each acs / hrc image was performed by using the publicly available routine img2xym_hrc , library psfs , and the distortion correction described in anderson & king ( 2006a ) .",
    "we corrected the photometric zero points in the same way as for the wfc photometry .",
    "the wfpc2 images are not ` _ flt`-type ( introduced only for later instruments ) , but rather the earlier equivalent ` _ c0f ` .",
    "we reduced them with the algorithms described in anderson & king ( 2000 ) .",
    "the field was calibrated to the photometric vega - mag flight system of wfpc2 according to the prescriptions of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .      for the wfc3 exposures we used the ` _ flt ` images .",
    "star positions and fluxes on wfc3/uvis images were measured with software based mostly on img2xym_wfi ( anderson et al .",
    "2006 ) , which implements a set of spatially variable empirical psfs for each individual exposure .",
    "we corrected positions for geometric distortion using the recipes given in bellini & bedin ( 2009 ) and bellini , anderson & bedin ( 2011 ) .",
    "photometry was calibrated as in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "infrared images were reduced with software based on that of anderson & king ( 2006a ) for acs / hrc .",
    "we constructed an empirical f160w `` effective psf '' using the 3-step procedures devised by anderson & king ( 2000 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the software , psf derivation , and geometric distortion solution will be presented elsewhere .",
    "photometry was calibrated as in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "since our aim is fine photometric discrimination , it was a great advantage to select the best - measured stars in our samples . to accomplish this , we closely followed the recipes and used the same selection criteria as given in milone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which makes use of several diagnostics :  photometric and astrometric rms , psf - fit residuals , and amount of scattered light from neighboring stars .",
    "( this last diagnostic is available only for acs / wfc catalogs because , as we stated above , different codes where used for different cameras , and only the one for the acs / wfc provides the additional diagnostic . )    for more information about our selection procedures we refer the reader to milone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "both ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 are in the direction of the galactic bulge , where extinction is a serious problem ( @xmath31 0.37 and 0.47 respectively , according to harris 1996 , 2010 edition ) .",
    "such large reddenings can be expected to be accompanied by serious differential reddening , which we treated with particular care .    as a first step , for each cmd we computed the direction of the reddening vector . for this we used the extinction coefficients in tables 14 and 15 of sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for g2 stars . for wfc3 f390w , which is not in those tables , we interpolated linearly between acs / hrc f330w and f435w , getting @xmath32 .",
    "for the f160w filter we adopted the value @xmath33 ( from yes , the york extinction solver ) , and used the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) extinction law . as we did for the wfpc2 , we took the extinction values from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we dealt with differential reddening ( dr ) by means of a method that is explained in detail in section 3.1 of milone et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , to which",
    "we refer the reader for details ; here we only describe the method briefly .",
    "the overall method consists of iterating a core procedure which itself has five steps : ( 1 ) we rigidly rotate the cmd to make the reddening direction parallel to the @xmath34 axis , so that dr becomes a simple shift in @xmath34 , and the @xmath34 distance of a star from the now - vertical fiducial becomes an estimate of its dr value .",
    "( 2 ) we next choose a set of `` reference stars ''  stars whose dr values are best suited to serve as standards .",
    "ideally these stars should lie in the parts of the cmd where the sequences are almost perpendicular to the reddening vector , i.e. , the sgb and the faint parts of the rgb ; to get enough reference stars , however , we had to include the upper part of the ms .",
    "( 3 ) we draw a fiducial line along the ms , sgb , and rgb using reference stars .",
    "( 4 ) our actual dr correction makes use of the fact that dr varies systematically with position in the field .",
    "what we do is to correct the color of each star by the median reddening of the nearest @xmath35 reference stars ( see below ) .",
    "( 5 ) we rotate the corrected values ( i.e. , corrected @xmath34 and unchanged @xmath36 ) back into the cmd frame .",
    "a final step in each iteration was to redraw the fiducial sequence in reaction to the changes in the choice of reference stars .",
    "( in practice , changes after the first iteration are trivial , though . )    for any cmd that we need to correct , we choose @xmath35 by trial and error , as a compromise between a large @xmath35 for robustness and a small one for spatial resolution .",
    "typical @xmath35 values are in the range 5070 .    the reason we need to iterate the process is to optimize the choice of the set of reference stars .",
    "as this choice improves , the dr correction gets better , and the sequences in the corrected cmd get sharper , allowing a more perceptive choice of reference stars  and so on , until the choice of reference stars no longer improves .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that the dr correction is always made to the original photometry , but with the new reference stars ; it is the optimization of the reference stars that makes the method work .",
    "we illustrate this procedure with our dr correction of ngc  6441 , several steps of which are shown in figure [ f : redd_ba ] .",
    "the first panel shows the @xmath37 vs.  @xmath38 cmd of the cluster around the sgb region , with our initial choice of reference stars marked in red , and our initially - drawn fiducial sequence in green .",
    "the next panel shows the result of the first application of the procedure ; the dr correction was good enough to produce a significant narrowing of all the sequences in the cmd ; moreover , the rgb is now bimodal , and the ms is showing suggestions of bimodality .",
    "this improvement allows us to choose a new set of reference stars ( marked in red ) , from which we have removed stars of the blue ms , and a number of binaries and field stars .",
    "the green line is the redrawn fiducial sequence .    as indicated , we iterated this procedure .",
    "three iterations were enough to reach our final choice of reference stars and the consequent dr correction .",
    "( a fourth iteration yielded negligible improvement . )",
    "the final dr - corrected cmd is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f : redd_ba ] .",
    "our procedure also allows us to construct reddening maps , by averaging the dr value used to correct the stars in each region .",
    "( note that we will return to this subject in sect .",
    "[ ss : ms ] , to present a specific validation of the ngc  6441 reddening map . )",
    "finally , we note that from this point on , all the cmds that we show are corrected for differential reddening .",
    "as noted in an earlier subsection , field - star contamination presents a serious problem in our analysis of the fine structure of the cmds .",
    "there is no problem for the acs / hrc and wfpc2 fields , which are at the cluster centers , where field stars represent a negligible fraction .",
    "the issue arises when we analyze acs / wfc data ( in particular go-10775 ) and the new wfc3 exposures ( go-11739 ) , which were taken off - center to avoid crowding .",
    "since the go-10775 and go-11739 exposures overlap for both clusters , we were able to measure proper motions , with a baseline of at least 4 years .",
    "in addition , some of go-11739 exposures of ngc  6441 were purposely taken a year apart , in order to measure proper motions in the parallel acs / wfc field , where it was clear that field - star contamination was very serious .",
    "this provides us with up to 5 years of time baseline between go-10775 and go-11739 for ngc  6441 ( and of course the 1-year baseline within go-11739  needed for cmds that use only that program ) .",
    "proper motions were measured using acs / wfc f606w and f814w exposures as first epoch and wfc3/uvis f390w exposures as second epoch .",
    "we did not use wfc3 ir exposures for proper motions , because of the more than twice - as - large pixel size of the ir detector and its severe undersampling .",
    "we used the catalogs created by anderson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to define a master coordinate frame . as we did in ( e.g. ) bellini et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , we first defined for each cluster a reference set of probable members , on the basis of their position in the @xmath39 vs.  @xmath40 cmd .",
    "these included only bright , unsaturated stars , which have smaller position errors .    for each star we took each and every pairing of a position measurement from the first epoch and another from the second epoch , and transformed each of the two catalog positions into the master frame , by means of a six - parameter linear transformation using only a local set of 50 reference stars",
    "; we then differenced the two epochs to derive a displacement for that pairing .",
    "we took a 3@xmath41-clipped median of all these displacements of the star , and assigned it a sigma that was the 68.27 percentile of the residuals around the median .",
    "since the reference stars are nearly all cluster members , the displacements of stars are all relative to the mean motion of the cluster .",
    "after this first estimate of the proper motions , we excluded from our selection of reference stars those whose motion differed from the mean by more than 3 sigmas , and re - derived the motions .",
    "after three iterations the process converged .",
    "even though the mean motions of both ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 are similar to the motions of the field stars , the dispersion of internal motion in each cluster is about five times smaller than that of field stars ( @xmath2118 km / s vs.  100 km / s ) .",
    "thus by selecting stars whose motion is close to the mean motion of the cluster , we exclude the majority of field stars .        for ngc  6388",
    ", the overlap region can be seen in the left panel of figure 1 , involving the bifurcated red and the bifurcated blue footprints at the lower left . in figure  [ f:6388_pm ]",
    "we illustrate our proper - motion selection .",
    "successive panels show the cmd of all the stars , the separation of cluster and field based on the sizes of motions , the cmd of the cluster stars , and the cmd of the field stars . from the last panel it is clear that in cmds where we do not have proper - motion separation , the risk of field - star contamination will be greatest for the sgb and ms regions .",
    "( note : although we had three filters available , we have chosen here to display the cmd using the more familiar f606w ",
    "f814w pairing ; f390w will come into play in our ensuing discussion of the details of the sequences of the cmds . )",
    "figure  [ f:6441_pm ] is the analog of fig .",
    "[ f:6388_pm ] , for ngc  6441 , in the overlap region of the same two programs ( the same colors and shapes of footprint , near the top of the right - hand panel of fig .  1 ) . in this case",
    "there are many more stars , both because of a larger overlap and also because these exposures are near the cluster center .",
    "also , field - star contamination is much more severe than for ngc  6388 , making cluster - field separation for ngc  6441 even more important .",
    "nevertheless , our proper - motion separation yields an almost clean sample of cluster members in panel ( c ) , even though panel ( d ) shows that we have lost a few cluster members .",
    "proper - motion - selected cmds will be used extensively throughout the paper .",
    "note also that when proper - motion measurements were available we used them to select bona - fide cluster members as reference stars for improved dr corrections .",
    "in this section we marshal the resources of our cameras and filters to examine each of the clusters in detail , in order to uncover all the evidence of multiple populations that we can find .",
    "we begin with an overview of a carefully chosen array of cmds of each cluster ; then we take up the regions of the cmd in detail , one by one .",
    "figure  [ f:6388_overview ] begins with two overall cmds of ngc  6388 . in panel",
    "( a ) we show the most familiar form of cmd , using f606w and f814w from the acs / wfc images of go-10775 ; it extends from the tip of the rgb down to five magnitudes below the ms turn - off .",
    "( these include the stars that we showed in the nearly identical cmd of panel 4(a ) , but now we include the fainter stars that did not figure in the proper - motion discussion . ) panel ( b ) shows a cmd from f390w and f160w of the wfc3/uvis and ir respectively , from go-11739 ; there are fewer stars here , because the smaller wfc3 images are off - center , but this is our widest color baseline , and this cmd is new .    in panels ( c)(g )",
    "we show in detail the five regions that are outlined in panel ( a ) ; for each detail panel , however , we use the combination of filters that best enhances the features of that part of the cmd .",
    "we will return to these in later subsections , but even now we readily see the splits of the rgb in ( c ) and the sgb in ( f ) as well as the complex structure of the red clump of the hb in ( d ) .",
    "( it is not obvious , but we shall see that panel ( g ) shows a greater ms width than photometric errors can account for . in any case , the corresponding panel for ngc  6441 will show a clear split . )",
    "panel ( e ) shows the extended blue hb , which has the anomalous blue tail of stars ( highlighted by larger dots ) . in each panel",
    "the reddening vector is shown as a red arrow .    in these panels",
    "we have plotted only those stars less affected by the severe crowding in these central fields .",
    "we omitted stars closer to the center than a magnitude - dependent limiting radius , which we chose by hand in a way that excludes larger regions for the fainter stars .",
    "proper - motion selection is not used in any of the panels of this figure .",
    "the purpose of panels ( a ) and ( b ) is simply to show the whole cmd and to define panels ( c)(g ) .",
    "panels ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) show cmd regions where field - star contamination is minimal , while in ( f ) and ( g ) any gain in sharpness would be greatly outweighed by the loss in star numbers from cutting back to the small overlap region between the go-10775 and go-11739 images .",
    "figure  [ f:6441_overview ] is an overview of the cmds of ngc  6441 , similar to fig .",
    "[ f:6388_overview ] for ngc  6388 .",
    "the cmd from go-10775 data alone ( panel ( a ) ) shows strong contamination from stars of the galactic bulge , as already mentioned .",
    "the 1-year time span of the go-11739 data set allowed us to remove most of the field stars from the largest - color - baseline cmd shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "( this is why there is less field contamination here than in fig .",
    "[ f:6388_overview]b . )",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) here have the same scale as those of fig .  [ f:6388_overview ] , so as to allow a direct visual comparison of the complete cmds of these two clusters .",
    "( similarly , in the following subsections we will show a direct comparison of the different evolutionary sequences of these clusters using cmds with the same filters and axis scale . )    again , in the @xmath37 vs.  @xmath42 plane we highlight five regions , labeled ( c ) to ( g ) , where the main cluster cmd features are present .",
    "the cmds zoomed around these regions are shown in the other panels of the figure , using the combinations of filters that best enhance these features , and taking advantage of proper motions to remove field stars , whenever useful ( panels ( c ) , ( d ) , ( f ) , and ( g ) ) .",
    "we did not use proper - motion selections for panel ( e ) .",
    "first , the blue hb is only marginally contaminated by field stars .",
    "second , because proper motions are confined to the overlap area between go-10775 and go-11739 , we would have ended up with only half as many stars , in a region of the cmd that is thinly populated . we need also to note that for panel ( d ) , for the rc of the hb , we had to use here the @xmath37 vs.  @xmath42 cmd instead of the @xmath43 vs.  @xmath44 cmd that we used for ngc  6388 , because for ngc  6441 the equivalent wfpc2 f439w images do not go deep enough .",
    "unlike ngc  6388 , the rgb of ngc  6441 clearly splits at its base when using the f390w filter ( panel ( c ) ) .",
    "furthermore , for the first time we can see that the ms of ngc  6441 is split into _ two distinct sequences _",
    "( panel ( g ) , more details later ) .    in the following subsections",
    "we will compare and analyze each evolutionary stage of the two clusters .",
    "we want to emphasize once again that all the cmds presented in this work are corrected for differential reddening effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : msd ] shows the cmds of ngc  6388 ( on the left ) and ngc  6441 ( on the right ) around the ms region in the @xmath45 vs.  @xmath38 plane , adopting the same axis scale .",
    "the reddening vectors are also displayed .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the ms morphology of these `` twin '' clusters is quite different .",
    "the ms of ngc  6388 is wider than expected from observational errors alone ( more in the following ) , but the cmds made using all combinations of filters at our disposal fail to provide any hints of a ms split . on the other hand",
    ", there seems to be no doubt that the ms of ngc  6441 is bimodal .",
    "because of the relatively high reddening values of the two clusters , one might suspect that the spread / split in the ms of the two clusters is the result of badly corrected differential reddening .",
    "we note , however , that the reddening vector runs parallel to the ms , so that reddening can not affect the width of the ms , nor should dr correction affect it either .",
    "this near - parallelism of the reddening vector to the ms should be kept in mind , as it applies to nearly all cmds .",
    "it will be seen , moreover , that a similar parallelism holds for the reddening vector and two - color diagrams of ms stars for all color combinations . indeed , if we plot an uncorrected cmd of a region of ngc  6441 small enough that differential reddening can not be an issue , the ms split is visible .    to further verify that we are not being deceived by serious systematics in our dr corrected photometry , we performed two specific tests . the left panel of fig .",

    "each point corresponds to a star , and is colored according to the dr correction found for it .",
    "the maximum extent of the dr corrections is 0.86 mag along the direction of the reddening vector .",
    "since the dr correction map shows a vertical gradient , for the first test ( test a ) we split the fov into upper and lower subsets containing the same numbers of stars , and performed the dr correction procedure on each of the two independent subsets , as a test of whether the apparent breadth of the ms could be just high / low reddening .",
    "the resulting cmds , in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , each show the ms split of panel ( a )  somewhat more clearly in ( c ) , because the stars of panel ( b ) suffer photometrically from the crowding in the cluster center . in the less perturbed photometry of panel ( c )",
    "one can even discern a dominant red component and a bluer tail in the colors .",
    "but the main point is that test a totally refutes the idea that the bluer and redder parts of the ms spread could simply be stars with greater and less reddening .    to investigate whether the ms spread / split might in fact result directly from crowding in the cluster center , we performed test b , in which the two halves of the sample were an inner one and an outer one , as shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the ms width is still evident in both samples , and the outer sample , in panel ( d ) , if anything shows the split even more strongly than panel ( c ) , above it .",
    "these tests show that the ms spread of ngc  6441 is real .",
    "moreover , when only less - crowded , well - measured stars are selected ( e.g. , right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] , but see also panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ f : redd_test ] ) , the ms splits into two branches , the redder one being the more populated .",
    "no ms split was visible in the case of ngc  6388 , but the tests just performed can be taken as evidence that the ms broadening observed there is also real , rather than an artifact of differential reddening .",

    "( 2009 ) of the ms broadening in 47  tuc , and by milone et al .",
    "( 2010b ) for ngc  6752 , an effective way of testing for a true cmd - sequence broadening is to divide the images of the field of stars into two independent halves .",
    "if the broadening is intrinsic , the stars that have redder ( or bluer ) colors in a cmd made from one half of the images will have redder ( or bluer ) colors in the cmd from the other half .",
    "but if the broadening is due only to measuring errors , a star that is redder in the first half of the images will have an equal chance of being redder or bluer in the second half , and the bluer stars of the first subset are equally likely to be red or blue in the second half . again",
    ", we note that the reddening vector is almost parallel to the ms ( see , e.g. , panel ( a ) of fig .",

    "the rectified ms obtained in this way , for the two independent set of images , is shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . in panel ( a ) the stars were divided into three equally - populated groups , color - coded in red , green and blue . in panel ( b ) we have kept for each star the same color that it had in panel ( a ) .",
    "( we decided to divide the ms into three groups rather than two , as we had done in our previous papers , to better understand the color behavior of the stars in the two subset of images . )",
    "it is clear that the color of stars is maintained very well ( with only a small scatter due to photometric errors ) from panel ( a ) to panel ( b ) . to emphasize this fact ,",
    "we show in panel ( c ) the correlation between the color of each star in the two halves of the data , divided in four different magnitude bins ( since measuring errors increase at fainter magnitudes ) .",
    "a star redder than the ms ridge line in the first half of the data is also measured as redder in the great majority of cases , in the second half of the data , and vice - versa .",
    "this is the mark of a true spread in color .    in panel ( d )",
    "we show the color distribution of the rectified ms as measured from the whole set of images , @xmath49 .",
    "the distribution of half the difference between the colors measured separately from each half of the images , @xmath50 , is presented in panel ( e ) .",

    "an estimate of the @xmath41 of the spread of the distribution is given ( calculated here as the 68.27 percentile of the absolute deviation from the median ) .",
    "as one can see , the intrinsic width of the ms is about three times as large as what would be expected from photometric errors alone .",
    "( as a further test , artificial stars within the magnitude interval shown in fig .  9 , and chosen to have @xmath42 colors along the ms of ngc  6388 , gave ms widths ranging from 0.005 to 0.027",

    "we then used the following procedure to effect a straightening that was a compromise for the two sequences .",
    "first we fitted a fiducial line to each of the two sequences , as follows : we divided the bsgb into ` ordinate ' intervals of 0.025 and the fsgb into intervals of 0.05 . for each sequence , within each of these intervals we computed 2.5-@xmath41-clipped median ` abscissa ' and ` ordinate ' values , and then put a smooth spline curve through those points .",
    "then as the line to use for rectification we took a line midway between the smooth spline curves of the two sequences .",

    "stars with ` abscissa ' between @xmath241.6 and 1.6 ( gray vertical lines ) and ` ordinate ' between 0.1 and 0.85 ( in red ) were selected for the radial - distribution analysis .",
    "we excluded from the analysis the innermost 25 arcsec because of high crowding , and divided the remainder of the go-10775 field into three radial intervals ( marked 1 , 2 and 3 in panel ( c ) ) in such a way as to have the same number of stars in each interval .",
    "the excluded innermost 25 arcsec are colored in azure .    for each radial interval ( panels ( d1 ) , ( d2 ) , and ( d3 ) ) we extracted the ` abscissa ' distribution of the stars within the limits , and did a simultaneous fit of a pair of gaussians to it , as done in bellini et al .",

    "after this somewhat complicated fitting procedure , it is not immediately obvious how to assign error bars to the numerical ratios of the two components , but the answer becomes clear when we step back and consider what we have done .",
    "our basic aim has been to determine , at each distance from the cluster center , what fraction of the population belongs to each component ;  the fitting of the dual gaussians was only a device for estimating how many stars belong to each population component .",

    "( a ) of figure  [ f:6388:rgb_rapp ] we see the brgb and frgb ( as we again call the two components ) well separated at the brighter end but badly blended at fainter magnitudes  a situation for which our dual - gaussian technique is well suited .",
    "we began with a transformation and rectification procedure like the one that we described for the sgb .",
    "this case was a little easier , because the two population branches turned out to be parallel after the transformation , so that fewer steps were required for the rectification .",
    "a glance at panel ( b ) reveals a serious problem , however : the encroachment of the agb on the brgb .",
    "( we purposely show a wide range of ` abscissa ' so as to expose this issue . ) because of the agb , the bluest range of ` abscissa ' will have to be `` out of bounds '' for our fitting of the gaussians , with a cut - off not far to the left of the peak of the gaussian that fits the bsgb .",
    "the placement of the cutoff is then a delicate question , to answer which we invent a special procedure . without any question of radial binning",
    "yet , we analyze _ all _ the stars that are between ` ordinate ' values 0 and 1 in panel ( b ) .",
    "we make use of the fact that the number of agb stars is a very different function of ` ordinate ' from the number of rgb stars . as a criterion for absence of agb interference",
    ", we divide the ` ordinate ' range from 0 to 1 into three separate parts , and require that the ratio @xmath93/@xmath94 , as derived from our dual - gaussian fitting with the lowest values of ` abscissa ' excluded , come out the same for all three ranges of ` ordinate ' .",
    "we carry out this test ( which is not illustrated here ) for various placements of the cut - off , and choose the cut - off that is farthest to the left but still satisfies the criterion .",
    "that value is the vertical gray line in panel ( b ) .",
    "( a thoughtful reader may ask how we can be sure that the two populations represented by the brgb and the frgb should have the same distribution of stars with ` ordinate ' value .",
    "the answer is that this distribution is set by gross rules of stellar structure , as a star moves up the rgb ; these rules are quite insensitive to the small differences that separate these two populations .",

    "our values of @xmath105 extend from @xmath21@xmath108 ( inside of which the crowding is too great ) out to @xmath21@xmath109 ; in this range , the number of bms stars relative to the rms shows a significant outward decrease .",
    "similarly , our study of the rgb showed an outward decrease of the number of brgb stars relative to frgb .",
    "however , as in the case of sgb and rgb stars in ngc  6388 , here too there is an inconsistency between the overall levels of @xmath105 and @xmath110 .",

    "[ tab:3 ]      in this section we summarize the results illustrated in figures 1922 , concerning the number ratios between the two populations , and the radial gradients of the ratios . in the outer regions of ngc  6441 ( outside @xmath21@xmath108 ) , the blue ms represents @xmath211/3 of the total population ( @xmath105@xmath111 ) , with a small radial gradient ; closer to the center the crowding prevents us from distinguishing the two mss . for the rgb we can reach the cluster center , where the frgb actually predominates by a little , with a radial gradient bringing @xmath101 below 0.5 farther out",
    "unfortunately , radial gradients make it difficult to compare population ratios for different evolutionary sequences , but it does look , at first sight , as if : ( i ) the cmd locus of the bms population crosses through the locus of the rms population ; ( ii ) the two sgbs overlap , and it is difficult to say whether the bms population joins the brgb or the frgb . for ngc  6388 we could not split the ms ,",
    "so the population ratio and its radial trend were derived only for the sgb and the rgb  complicating comparisons , by leaving us with ms and rgb for ngc  6441 , but sgb and rgb for ngc  6388 .",
    "the results for the two clusters are summarized in tables 3 and 4 , respectively , which give the median radius of each zone , the number of stars in the zone , the fraction that belong to the fainter component ( or in the case of the ms , to the bluer branch ) , and the statistical uncertainty of the fraction .",
    "alternatively , the same results can be viewed graphically in the ( e ) panels of figures 1922 .",
    "the overall tendency is to have one sequence more concentrated towards the cluster center , although this is not always statistically significant . in particular , for ngc  6441 both bms and brgb are more centrally concentrated , and the latter can be considered the progeny of the former . for ngc  6388 , instead , while the fsgb population is more centrally concentrated , the distribution of the two populations in the rgb region is found to be flat .",
    "based solely on star counts , we can tentatively consider brgb as the progeny of bsgb , each being the more populated branch .",
    "[ tab:4 ]    [ tab:5 ]    [ tab:6 ]        in the study of the population ratios listed in tables 3 and 4 , it is important to judge whether apparent radial gradients are real or not . to test this",
    ", we calculated a least - squares line through each set of points . with at most five observed points , any formal error for the slope of the line would be meaningless , so we instead made a monte carlo simulation . in place of each observed point we took a gaussian with mean equal to the value of the point , and with the sigma of the point , and we calculated the slope @xmath112 for each of a million random samplings from these gaussians .",
    "the million values of @xmath112 had a distribution that was closely gaussian ; table 5 gives the resulting slopes ( per arcmin ) and their sigmas . in the last column of the table",
    "is the ratio of @xmath113 to @xmath41 , which is an index of how reliably a slope differs from zero ; a @xmath114 result is of course only marginal , while a @xmath115 result is quite significant .",
    "thus the radial gradient in fig .",
    "19 is marginal , that in fig .",
    "20 dubious , and those in figs .  21 and 22 highly significant",
    "we have analyzed a large sample of proprietary ( go-11739 ) and archival images of the two massive , metal - rich galactic - bulge gcs ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , have used proper motions to remove most of the field stars , have corrected all our cmds for differential reddening , and have made a thorough multicolor analysis of the stellar populations of the two clusters .    in both clusters we found significant evidence for the presence of at least two stellar generations , which manifest themselves as broadened or multiple sequences in all the main evolutionary branches of the cmds .",
    "table  6 collects the main results on the multiplicity of the various sequences .",
    "these results are distilled from a quite complex data set , whose most important aspects are summarized next .    the ms of ngc  6388 is analyzed with various filter combinations in figs .",
    "most of the cmds show a broadening of the ms , but none of them succeeds in splitting it into distinct sequences as instead happens for ngc  6441 when using the @xmath38 color , as shown in figures  6(g ) and 21 .",
    "the separation of the two mss of this latter cluster as a function of color baseline is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f:6441_mca ] figure  [ f : redd_test ] further confirms the reality of these results for both clusters , showing that neither of them could result from differential reddening ( for which all cmds have been corrected ) .",
    "note , moreover , that the average reddening of ngc  6388 is lower than that of ngc  6441 ( see subsection  2.5 ) , hence it should have been easier to recognize two mss ( if present ) compared to the case of ngc  6441 .",
    "we conclude that the ms structures of the two clusters are different .",
    "the sgbs of the two clusters are examined in fig .",
    "[ f : sgb_diff ] which shows a clear split for the sgb of ngc  6388 in panel ( a ) but at best a doubtful one for ngc  6441 in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , where the sgb components apparently overlap ; figures  14 and 15 , respectively , explore the sgb for each cluster in multicolor domains .",
    "again , we note this more subtle difference between the two clusters , with two distinct sgbs in ngc  6388 and just a broadened sgb in ngc  6441 ( the opposite situation compared to the ms ) .    the structure of the rgb of the two clusters is shown in fig .",
    "16 . in both cases there is a hint of a double rgb , more evident in the upper part of the rgb of ngc  6388 and in the lower part for ngc  6441 .",
    "the evolutionary connection between the ms and the rgb is somewhat ambiguous in the case of ngc  6441 : the population ratio seems to indicate that bms and frgb stars belong to the same population , but the radial gradient ( which complicates the calculation of the population ratios ) suggests instead to connect the bms to the brgb . for ngc  6388",
    "it appears that bsgb and brgb stars belong to the same population .    for the hb we have thus far examined only the red clump ; we take up the extended blue part of the hb in the following .",
    "the split of the rc of ngc  6388 can be seen in the two - color diagrams in panels ( a ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "17 , while for ngc  6441 the broadening is seen in most of the panels of fig .  18 .",
    "therefore there is some evidence that the rc is also a mixture of the first and second generations .",
    "however , what makes these two clusters unique , among the 150 globular clusters of the milky way , is their blue hb extension in spite of their high metallicity .",
    "furthermore , their blue hbs are remarkably similar , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : hb_con ] .",
    "note also the similarity of the relative number of stars in the distinct sections into which we have divided the hb .",
    "this similarity is particularly surprising given that  as is well known  the distribution of stars on the hb is extremely sensitive to many different parameters ( age , composition , rgb mass loss ) .",
    "thus , the differences in the structure of the ms , sgb and rgb of the two clusters demonstrate that there must be a sizable difference in some of those parameters , and yet the hbs turn out to be very similar .",
    "conundrum _ is further discussed in the last subsection .",
    "photometric differences in the cmd between multiple stellar populations in gcs have been attributed to differences in helium ( e.g. , bedin et al .",
    "2004 ; norris 2004 ; dantona et al .  2005",
    "; piotto et al .  2005 , 2007 ) or in light - element abundances ( e.g. , sbordone et al .",
    "different photometric bands can enhance different effects of the chemical pattern of the population .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the presence of helium - enriched stars in these two clusters was first proposed based on the exceptional morphology of their hbs and on the properties of their rr lyrae variables .",
    "now , the discovery of a double main sequence in ngc  6441 lends support to this interpretation , and favors a scenario in which the helium - rich stars belong to a second stellar generation , as opposed to the possibility that they would owe high helium to deep - mixing on the upper rgb , as proposed by sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) .",
    "our studies of 47  tuc ( milone et al .",
    "2012b ) , ngc  6397 ( milone et al.2012c ) , and ngc  6752 ( milone et al .",
    "2010 ) demonstrate that light - element variations should not significantly affect the @xmath66 or @xmath116 colors of ms stars , so we explore the possibility of helium being the chief cause of the observed ms split in ngc  6441 ( or of ms broadening , depending on the specific bands ) . to this end , we calculated synthetic colors for the two mss , adopting a primordial helium @xmath117=0.26 for the rms , while trying for the bms @xmath117 values between 0.27 and 0.36 , in steps of 0.01 .",
    "we assumed for each sub - population the same iron abundance ( [ fe / h]=@xmath240.55 harris 1996 , 2010 edition , see also carretta et al .",
    "2009b , origlia et al . 2008 ) .",
    "note that a difference of 0.1 dex in [ fe / h ] ( which represents the present uncertainty in the metallicity difference between the two clusters ) in the calculated models does not change our conclusions .    in previous papers",
    "we have used a similar approach to estimate helium differences between gc sub - populations , but there we knew the light - element abundance of the two mss and here we do not .",
    "hence , we assume the abundance of c , n and o to be the same , in spite of likely differences in at least their relative proportions between the first and second generations . in practice , we assumed [ c / fe]=@xmath240.45 , [ o / fe]=0.27 ( origlia et al .",
    "2008 ) , and solar n abundance . in both cases we used [ @xmath118/fe]=0.3 ( origlia et al .",
    "2008 ) . neglecting possible differences of cno proportions should not affect our conclusion about helium because , as noted above , the f606w , f814w and f160w filter bands are almost completely insensitive to c , n , and o , while only f390w is expected to be somewhat affected by abundance variations in these light - elements .",
    "we adopted the synthetic colors from the basti isochrones ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ) in order to compare observations and synthetic colors , and determined @xmath119 and @xmath120 for ms stars at @xmath37=21.5 .",
    "the atlas12 code ( kurucz 2005 ; castelli 2005 ; sbordone et al .",
    "2007 ) was then used , which allows us to work with arbitrary chemical compositions .",
    "we performed spectral syntheses from 3,400   to 20,000   by using the synthe code ( kurucz 2005 ) , and integrated the synthetic spectra over the transmission curves of the four filters . from the resulting fluxes we formed , for each value of @xmath117 , the differences @xmath121 .",
    "our result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ms_chem ] .",
    "we found that the value @xmath122=0.32 optimizes the agreement between models and observations .",
    "the overall good agreement suggests that helium can indeed be the main cause of the observed split , with bms stars being he - enhanced by @xmath29@xmath210.06 relative to rms stars .",
    "best - fit model and data are less in agreement for the f390w point , as expected because this band - pass includes cn and ch molecular bands , hence the flux through this band is sensitive to cno variations ( e.g. , milone et al .",
    "2012b ) .",
    "in the case of ngc  6388 there is no evidence of a split in its ms , which is clearly broader than expected from photometric errors , but the color spread ( in @xmath38 ) is smaller than that of ngc  6441 .",

    "the color distributions appear to be symmetric in ngc  6388 but slightly skewed bluewards in ngc  6441 .",
    "table  7 gives the ms breadths , from fitting gaussians to the distribution of @xmath0color .",

    "these breadths are also plotted in fig .",

    "we conclude that the intrinsic @xmath126 color dispersions of the two mss are quite similar , so that despite the different manifestation of the two populations , at least their helium distributions must likewise be quite similar .    though a complete and thorough analysis and interpretation of the numerous cmds presented here is deferred to a future paper ( cassisi et al . in preparation ) , we wish to present here some further remarks on the estimates of the helium abundance in the stellar populations of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .    the @xmath117@xmath210.32 that we found for the bms stars in ngc  6441 from the ms separations in the various color baselines can be compared with the he content estimated by caloi and dantona ( 2007 ) and by busso et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from their analysis of the hb morphology and of the pulsational properties of the rr lyrae stars in this cluster .",
    "busso et al .",
    "were able to reproduce the blue and tilted hb morphology of ngc  6441 by assuming a he abundance @xmath117@xmath1270.35 for the second - generation stars , only @xmath210.03 higher than our estimate from the ms split .",
    "at the same time caloi & dantona suggested that a fraction of the ngc  6441 stars would have a he content as high as @xmath117=0.380.40 in order to account for the extreme blue part of the hb .",
    "part of this discrepancy with our present result and that of busso et al .  could be due to the use of optical bands by caloi & dantona , which surely are not optimal for studying the very hot hb extension ( see dalessandro et al .",
    "moreover , in order to match synthetic to observed hbs , both busso et al .  and caloi & dantona appeal to a substantial spread of helium from @xmath117@xmath1280.25 in the first generation up to the their maximum estimated values ( 0.35 and 0.40 , respectively ) .",
    "our result , with two distinct mss in ngc 6441 suggests instead that ( at least in this cluster ) there are basically two distinct values of the helium abundance , with a clear gap in between .",
    "furthermore , there is yet another puzzling inconsistency between the results of those two investigations based on the hb and the results of the present paper .",
    "according to caloi & dantona only @xmath2138% of the stars in ngc  6441 would have primordial he content ( @xmath1290.25 ) , whereas according to busso et al .",
    "only 1516% of the stars should belong to the second generation .",
    "though in different ways , both results are at variance with what we obtained from the two mss of this cluster , i.e. , the majority of stars ( @xmath130% ) are on the red ( presumably first - generation ) ms and only @xmath131 appear to belong to the second generation",
    ". we shall come back to this issue in the next subsection .",
    "at least part of these discrepancies can be traced to the assumption made by busso et al .  that the whole red clump consists of first - generation stars , with second - generation stars confined to the blue hb extension",
    "; indeed , the rc represents @xmath211215% of the total hb population .",
    "we have found instead that the rc is a mixture of first- and second - generation stars .",
    "it is then possible that all second - generation stars arrive on the hb at the rc , spend there roughly 50% of the hb lifetime , and then evolve into an extended blue loop for the remaining @xmath2150% of the time .",
    "in fact , as emphasized by caloi & dantona , the evolution of the helium - rich and metal - rich hb models may be confined to the rc region , or , after spending some time on the rc , the stars may experience an extended excursion reaching very blue colors for differences in total mass of order of just @xmath132 ( sweigart & gross 1978 ) .",
    "for this reason , it is difficult to precisely pinpoint the helium abundance from the mere extension of the hb .",
    "finally , we note that the ms breadth in the @xmath133 color increases with decreasing luminosity ( see fig .  26 and table  7 ) in a fashion that apparently can not be accounted for by the increasing photometric errors .",
    "here , we simply observe that an increase of the ms spread in the 23 magnitude interval below the to is also observed in the mss of @xmath52  cen ( king et al .",
    "2012 ) and ngc 2808 ( piotto et al .",
    "we shall return on this observational evidence in a future paper .",
    "as already emphasized , these two clusters are unique in having a major blue horizontal branch extension in spite of their high metallicity and in the properties of their rr lyrae variables .",
    "furthermore , their hbs are remarkably similar in shape and extension and even in the relative star numbers along the branches ( see fig .  [",
    "f : hb_con ] ) .",
    "the two clusters also have in common the presence of two population components whose distinctness is evident in various parts of their cmds , with the population that is ( slightly ) more concentrated to the center likely being the second generation .",
    "the outstanding anomaly , however , is that whereas the ms of ngc  6441 is clearly split into two branches ( in @xmath38 color ) , that of ngc  6388 is single , though broadened .",
    "given the extremely high sensitivity of the hb morphology to the helium abundance , we conclude that the helium difference between the two stellar generations must be similar , in the two clusters . the results presented in fig .",
    "[ t1_2 ] and [ t3 ] , showing the close similarity of the ms of the two clusters in the @xmath42 color , strengthen this conclusion further .",
    "how can these clusters exhibit almost identical hbs while having very different ms properties in @xmath38 color ?",
    "in other words , if the second generation populations in the two clusters have nearly identical helium abundances , why is the ms split in ngc  6441 but not in ngc  6388 ? clearly , something else must differ in order to reduce below detection the ms split of ngc  6388 , or to amplify that of ngc 6441 .",
    "this is the _ conundrum _ of what is otherwise a pair of twin clusters .",
    "one possibility is metallicity [ fe / h ] , such that in ngc  6388 the helium - rich population is also somewhat metal - enriched , while it is not in ngc  6441 .",
    "this possibility appears to be excluded by the high - resolution spectroscopy of carretta et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , according to which rgb stars in ngc  6388 have the same [ fe / h ] within @xmath210.01 dex .",
    "their sample consists of just seven stars , however , so that the chance of their having missed the minority population is not entirely negligible .",
    "however , among these seven stars there appears to be a spread in oxygen , sodium , and aluminum abundances , which should indicate that , though small , the sample actually includes stars from both the first and the second generation .",
    "this is confirmed also by a lower - resolution study of a larger sample of stars ( carretta et al .",
    "the option that the seven stars of carretta et al .",
    "all belonged to a single population does not appear to be supported by observations .    as emphasized above",
    ", the main difference between the two clusters arises when the f390w filter comes into play , and within its passband strong cn and ch bands are included ( see fig .  32 in milone",
    "a more attractive option is therefore that the secondary population in ngc  6388 is cno - enhanced compared with the first generation , though this requires a chemical enrichment scenario that is quite ad hoc . in this way excess",
    "cn and/or ch molecular blanketing in the uv would make redder the ms of the secondary population in this cluster .",
    "a similar effect could also be produced by the c : n : o proportions in the secondary population of ngc  6388 being different from those in the secondary population of ngc  6441 .",
    "we defer to a future paper a more quantitative exploration of these alternatives ( cassisi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , but we note that further progress will require an extensive spectroscopic exploration of these clusters at high spectral resolution , in particular having photometrically identified the targets as belonging to one or the other sub - population . more extensive",
    "_ observations , especially at ultraviolet wavelengths , would also help in solving this conundrum .",

    "<S> ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 are two massive galactic bulge globular clusters which share many properties , including the presence of an extended horizontal branch ( hb ) , quite unexpected because of their high metal content . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) give compelling evidence that both clusters host at least two stellar populations , which manifest themselves in different ways . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  6388 has a broadened main sequence ( ms ) , a split sub - giant branch ( sgb ) , and a split red giant branch ( rgb ) that becomes evident above the hb in our data set ; its red hb is also split into two branches . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  6441 has a split ms , but only an indication of two sgb populations , while the rgb clearly splits in two from the sgb level upward , and no red hb structure . </S>",
    "<S> the multicolor analysis of the cmds confirms that the he difference between the two main stellar populations in the two clusters must be similar . </S>",
    "<S> this is observationally supported by the hb morphology , but also confirmed by the color distribution of the stars in the ms optical band cmds . </S>",
    "<S> however , a ms split becomes evident in ngc  6441 using uv colors , but not in ngc  6388 , indicating that the chemical patterns of the different populations are different in the two clusters , with c , n , o abundance differences likely playing a major role . </S>",
