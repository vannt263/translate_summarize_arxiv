    "in addition , model independent results following from symmetry priciples alone can still be obtained and numerically verified in a rigorous way as we will see . on the other hand , lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) studies @xcite are a first principles , approximation - free approach , but they still present a significant computational challenge when attempting to verify ultraviolet and infrared limits @xcite .",
    "the abelian nature of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in many ways makes it a much simpler system to study than a nonabelian theory such as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . for this reason it has been the subject of many nonperturbative studies , which have as their long - term goal a detailed understanding of nonperturbative qcd . on the other hand ,",

    "one refinement in our application of the c - p vertex @xcite in the present work is associated with subtleties in the ultraviolet regularization scheme .",
    "although there have been some exploratory studies of dimensional regularization for the dse @xcite , this has not yet proven practical in nonperturbative field theory and momentum cutoffs for now remain the regularization scheme of choice in such studies .",

    "as a result , as @xmath1 for any given solution the values for the bare mass also presented a decaying oscillatory behaviour @xcite . clearly , these oscillating solutions can not be obtained from the chiral limit procedure ( i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath1 ) and hence can not be chirally symmetric solutions .",

    "this divergent behavior of the mass was verified to the numerical accuracy of our solutions ( 1 in @xmath128 ) .",

    "@xcite ) and is inevitable since in the absence of ecsb in the quenched theory there is only one external scale ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "while the above conclusions were based on a numerical study with a specific choice of vertex , it is relatively straightforward to construct a general argument which applies irrespective of this choice : consider any vertex @xmath131 which satisfies the wti and which leads to multiplicative renormalizability @xcite .",
    "it automatically follows that @xmath74 and @xmath132 are renormalization point independent as discussed previously .",
    "we can then define dimensionless quantities by appropriately scaling with @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "note that the renormalization condition @xmath82 automatically determines @xmath69 for a given solution for fixed @xmath15 , ( see eq .  ( [ eq_z2 ] ) ) .",
    "the dimensionless functions @xmath138 and @xmath139 of the dimensionless variable @xmath140 can only depend on dimensionless parameters , i.e. , @xmath126 , @xmath19 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "furthermore , since for any fixed @xmath15 they are independent of @xmath14 ( recall that we are working only in the quenched approximation ) , then it follows that they must in turn be independent of @xmath141 . now for any finite @xmath15 and the choice @xmath71 we have @xmath143 .",

    "we see then that the resulting @xmath74 must diverge with @xmath15 as was found numerically . to summarize , we see that above critical coupling any vertex which satisfies the wti and leads to multiplicative renormalizability will lead to a diverging mass function in the continuum limit for quenched qed in four dimensions .    it is interesting to contrast this result with the well - known behavior @xcite found in qcd , which leads to a well defined and finite chiral limit in the continuum .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of qcd has been well - established in the ultraviolet regime due to asymptotic freedom in the form of a decreasing running coupling constant @xmath146 .",
    "this can be used in a renormalization group improved treatment of the ultraviolet region in the dse study of dcsb in the quark propagator @xcite .",
    "given that we know that the chiral limit leads to a divergent mass function above critical coupling , what are we then to make of the well - behaved finite solutions ?",
    "our conventional thinking about the chiral limit would imply that since ecsb should only increase the mass function above that found in its absence , then any solution above critical coupling which also has ecsb in the conventional sense must also correspond to a divergent mass in the continuum limit .",
    "thus the finite solutions do not correspond to the chiral limit nor to any conventional concept of ecsb .",
    "it has by now probably become clear that a given set of the parameters @xmath126 , @xmath4 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 , and @xmath15 actually admits more than one finite solution . if the renormalization point @xmath14 is chosen to lie far enough in the infrared that no oscillations in the mass can occur for @xmath147 , then specifying the renormalized mass @xmath5 rather than the bare mass @xmath4 leads to a unique solution .",

    "the number of simultaneous solutions becomes infinite .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : the oscillations have a period in terms of ln@xmath148 which is independent of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus the higher is @xmath15 the more oscillations can be squeezed in between the ir and the uv cut - off . as we increase @xmath5 with everything else fixed , we push oscillations along the @xmath3 axis . each time that a full oscillation is pushed past the uv cut - off ( @xmath149 )",
    "there will be two solutions which give the same value for @xmath4 .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that we can also induce these multiple solutions in qcd by lowering @xmath5 below that which corresponds to the chiral limit .",
    "this would correspond to a `` negative '' ecsb and would then again lead to multiple solutions .",
    "a numerical test of this expectation is currently being pursued by implementing the renormalization program in a qcd - based study of the quark dse @xcite . while the dse for the quark propagator is not yet well - understood in the ir ,",
    "the multiple solutions should manifest themselves in the uv and will not depend on the detailed anstze used for the qcd propagators and vertex in the ir .",
    "we have studied renormalized quenched strong - coupling qed in four dimensions in arbitrary covariant gauge .",
    "we saw that there is no finite chiral limit of the renormalized theory on general grounds above the critical coupling .",
    "in addition , we showed that above critical coupling for the gauge - covariance - improved treatment of the curtis - pennington proper fermion - photon vertex , there are an infinite number of renormalized finite solutions corresponding to the same bare mass in the continuum limit .",
    "all of the finite solutions have oscillations and differ in how far out on the momentum scale the first oscillation occurs .",
    "it seems likely that this behavior for the finite solutions is independent of the detailed vertex choice and furthermore that the same behavior can be induced in qcd by forcing the renormalized mass into an unphysical regime ( by choosing @xmath75 below the value corresponding to the chiral limit ) .",
    "it also seems likely that unquenching the theory will not remove this rather undesirable behaviour in qed@xmath0 , since the running coupling increases with scale rather than decreasing as in qcd .",
    "these latter conjectures are the subject of current investigation @xcite .",
    "this study supports the assertion that in four dimensions strong coupling qed does not have a continuum limit in the conventional sense .",
