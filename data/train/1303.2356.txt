    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave phenomena have now been observed to be ubiquitous throughout the solar atmosphere and are considered to be a potential mechanism for the transport of energy for the heating of the solar atmosphere and the acceleration of the solar wind ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , no individual mechanism has yet been identified for converting a portion of the mechanical energy generated in the sun s convection zone to heat .    both incompressible and compressible",
    "mhd waves are widely reported throughout the solar atmosphere ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and incompressible waves in the solar wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent advances in ground and space - based solar telescopes have allowed for the detection of ubiquitous incompressible transverse waves , both in the chromosphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and in the solar corona ( @xcite , @xcite ) . however , the incompressible waves are difficult to dissipate without strong gradients in alfvn speed ( e.g. , resonant absorption - @xcite ) or some process to cause a cascade of the wave energy to higher frequencies ( e.g. , mhd turbulence - @xcite ) where they are efficiently dissipated by , e.g. , cyclotron damping ( @xcite ) .",
    "the solar magnetic field acts as a channel with the potential to distribute wave energy around the solar atmosphere . in the quiet sun at the photospheric level , a large percentage of the magnetic flux appears to be concentrated into intense magnetic elements ( spatial scales of @xmath0  km ) that outline the supergranule network .",
    "some of these concentrations of magnetic flux are observed to undergo a significant expansion at the chromosphere / transition region , forming magnetic funnels that could be preferential sites for solar wind acceleration or the legs of large- scale coronal loops ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of the flux may form cell - spanning chromospheric structures , providing a magnetic canopy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "smaller concentrations of magnetic flux also exist in the internetwork ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , potentially generating additional magnetic structure below the magnetic canopy .",
    "the largest source of wave - energy is the continually evolving sub - photospheric convection , which generates a wide spectrum of mhd fluctuations .",
    "the influence of convection on the magnetic elements is well studied at the photospheric level . typically ,",
    "the observations have focused on tracing the motion of strong , localised magnetic flux elements , referred to as magnetic bright points ( mbps ) when seen in the g - band 4305   line ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or more recently in the h@xmath1 line wings ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the continuous jostling of the mbps leads to the excitation of mhd waves and oscillations , well described by the theory of mhd oscillations in magnetic flux tubes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one particular aspect of convective motion that has received increased attention recently is the generation of vortices at the solar surface",
    ". observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and advanced simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of solar granulation have revealed these vortex features are almost everywhere on the solar disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that the vortex motion has an observable influence on the upper layers of the solar atmosphere , suggesting they may play a role in heating .",
    "further , simulations of @xcite have demonstrated that the twisting of an open flux - tube by vortices at the photospheric level leads to the generation of mhd waves , in particular incompressible ( i.e. , torsional alfvn and transverse / kink ) waves .",
    "the transverse waves have recently been the subject of some controversy , with discussions on their nature , properties and nomenclature .",
    "the properties of the transverse waves in solar magnetic flux tubes are well understood ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , with a significant volume of research dedicated to developing realistic models , including , e.g. , magnetic structuring ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , density structuring ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , flux tube geometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , multiple flux tubes ( @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , resonant damping ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) , partial ionization ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important properties of the low - frequency transverse waves is that they are highly incompressible ( @xcite ) , requiring large gradients in the alfvn speed to damp the waves .",
    "it is this property ( shared with low - frequency bulk alfvn waves of a homogeneous plasma ) that means incompressible waves can pass through the lower solar atmosphere relatively undamped , making them a good candidate for acceleration of the solar wind . observations of incompressible waves in the quiet chromosphere ( @xcite , @xcite ) , quiet corona ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the solar wind ( @xcite ) support this idea . another important property , that makes these waves relatively easy to observe , is that the transverse wave causes a physical displacement of the flux tubes axis .    to assess exactly what role the incompressible mhd waves play in determining the dynamics of the solar atmosphere",
    ", one needs to combine advance models of wave propagation throughout the atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with observations .",
    "the observations should aim to determine how the waves are being generated and track the wave - energy as it propagates through the solar atmosphere .",
    "this should reveal how much wave energy is present in each distinct region of the solar atmosphere and where the dissipation of this energy occurs .",
    "the tracking of waves through the solar atmosphere has been made a realistic possibility by the development of high spatial and temporal resolution multi - filter systems , that can observe different heights in the lower atmosphere simultaneously ( e.g. , rapid oscillations in the solar atmosphere ( rosa ) , crisp imaging spectro - polarimeter ) . the potential of these observational set - ups for wave tracking is demonstrated in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such ground - based telescopes complement the satellites , e.g. hinode , solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , which provide detailed observations in uv / euv",
    ".    this paper reports the observation of both chromospheric torsional alfvn and kink waves and provides evidence that the waves are generated by photospheric vortices .",
    "the analysed data is a high resolution , high cadence series of g - band , calcium k and hydrogen  @xmath1 lines observed with rosa located at the dunn solar telescope , usa . the rosa observations are supplemented with sdo data .",
    "photospheric flows are determined using local correlation tracking ( lct ) and compared to numerical simulations of convection ( section  4 ) . a statistical method for obtaining information on chromospheric kink waves",
    "is described based on the analysis of time - distance diagrams .",
    "the data presented here has been studied in part in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained at 15:41 - 16:51  ut on 29 september 2010 , with the dunn solar telescope at sacramento peak , usa .",
    "a six - camera system called rosa was employed , details of which are given in @xcite . in brief , a @xmath2 region of the quiet solar atmosphere , positioned close to disk centre ( n0.9 , w6.8 ) , was imaged with a spatial sampling of @xmath3  pixel@xmath4 .",
    "we note here this is the corrected pointing to that given in @xcite .    during the observations , high - order adaptive optics ( @xcite )",
    "were used to correct for wave - front deformations in real time .",
    "the seeing conditions were good but variable .",
    "some frames in each of the data series are subject to significant distortions .",
    "we exclude periods of seeing containing frames of inadequate quality .",
    "rosa obtained images in multiple wavelengths including g - band ( 4305.5  - 9   width ) , ca k ( 3933.7   ) narrowband ( 1   ) and h@xmath1 core ( 6562.8   ) narrowband ( 0.25   ) filters .",
    "the g - band data was sampled at 16.6 frame s@xmath4 , h@xmath1 at 2.075 frame s@xmath4 and ca k 1.66 frame s@xmath4 and the images were improved by using speckle reconstruction ( @xcite ) utilising a @xmath5 ratio .",
    "the cadence of the reconstructed g - band , h@xmath1 and ca k time - series are @xmath6  s , @xmath7  s and @xmath8  s , respectively . to ensure accurate co - alignment in all bandpasses ,",
    "the broadband times series were fourier co - registered and de - stretched ( @xcite ) .",
    "images from the sdo atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) are also presented to provide context for the state of the upper atmosphere above the above the rosa field of view .",
    "the images from sdo are processed with _",
    "aia_prep _ and have a spatial resolution of 0.6 pixel@xmath4 .",
    "the region of the sun observed by rosa is a typical quiet sun area",
    ". the focus of the investigation will be on a sub - region of the rosa field of view that contains a feature of particular interest .",
    "images of this sub - region are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov ] . in the g - band images ,",
    "a number of mbps are clearly identifiable .",
    "the bright points are a good proxy for strong concentrations of magnetic flux , however , strong magnetic flux can still be present without an associated mbp ( @xcite ) .",
    "specific conditions appear to be needed for an mbp to appear in g - band ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "on viewing the movie of the g - band time series , the mbps are seen to be pushed and jostled by the convective motions of the granules , merging and splitting and appearing and disappearing from the bandpass .    the ca k images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov]b ) also show bright points , displaying a close mapping to the mbp s seen in g - band .",
    "this suggests the ca k bright points are the chromospheric counterpart to the g - band mbps .",
    "however , the ca k bright points are more diffuse , possibly due to expansion of the magnetic flux with height and partially due to the properties of the filter .",
    "the bright points are also more persistent than the g - band mbps , hence show a different morphology .",
    "the images also contain acoustic grains and reversed granulation , which have been identified previously .",
    "these features ( possibly including the diffuse mbp nature ) are present due to the large width of the filter bandpass used for these observations , meaning that the ca k images here have contributions from both photospheric and chromospheric sources ( for a detailed explanation , see @xcite ) . selecting a sufficiently narrow filter to image",
    "ca k line centre can avoid the photospheric contamination and allow mainly chromospheric contributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the h@xmath1 core bandpass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov]c ) , few signatures of the mbps are visible .",
    "the region is covered with fine - scale structure , such as elongated , cell - spanning fibrils and a few shorter mottles ( jet - like structures ) . due to the narrow width of the filter",
    ", the h@xmath1 core images show the true , magnetically dominated ( low-@xmath9 ) chromosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed features , i.e. , the fibrils and mottles , are thought to highlight the chromospheric magnetic field , with the structures likely to be density enhancements along individual magnetic field lines ( this is supported by recent modelling of h@xmath1 line formation by @xcite ) .    in the following section we pay particular attention to the area highlighted by the dashed box in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov ] . a number of fibrils and mottles can be seen to emanate from this region . at the photospheric level ,",
    "the g - band images reveal that a number of mbps appear and disappear .",
    "the counterpart ca k bright points remain present , although some of the brighter elements fade and brighten with time .",
    "these underlying features lead us to suggest the highlighted h@xmath1 region is the chromospheric section of a of a magnetic flux concentration , associated with an mbp , that has undergone significant expansion from the photosphere .",
    "the observed mbps diameters are @xmath10  km while the h@xmath1 feature has a diameter of @xmath11  km .",
    "the described magnetic structure is thought to be common in the quiet solar atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and is also revealed in observations of chromospheric swirls by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure above the chromosphere is much harder to determine .",
    "[ fig : rosafov ] ( d - f ) displays images from sdo / aia in the @xmath12   , @xmath13   and @xmath14   bandpasses . a near - by active region is visible in the upper right hand corner of each image , however , it can be seen that the rosa field of view is far from the active region in an area of quiet sun .",
    "now , our attention is focused on the dynamical behaviour of the unique region identified in the previous section ( dashed box fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov ] ) . to provide insight into the horizontal motions of the magnetic elements we exploit lct .",
    "this technique was originally introduced into solar physics to track large - scale ( spatial and temporal ) photospheric flows , e.g. , @xcite , and the technique has been developed further for use on magnetograms by incorporating the induction equation ( e.g. , dave - @xcite ) .",
    "we developed an lct algorithm based on the routine @xmath15 ( developed by t. tarbell ) available in the ssw trace software tree .",
    "a recent version of this routine first apodizes a set of images using a hanning function , then computes the cross - correlation between the images .",
    "the position of the maximum of the cross - correlation corresponds to the integer pixel shifts between the images .",
    "a local region centred on the maximum is then fitted with a quadratic polynomial regression equation to locate the maximum with sub - pixel accuracy , hence providing sub - pixel accuracy on the shifts .",
    "the routine was tested on sample data , which consists of hundreds of different images taken from the rosa data series .",
    "the images were shifted using the routine @xmath16 ( available in the general ssw software tree ) .",
    "taking averages over large numbers of images , we find that shifts as small as @xmath17 pixels can be resolved to within @xmath18 pixels .",
    "the accuracy of the lct improves with increasing shift size .",
    "there appears to be potential for great accuracy when calculating small shift values statistically , however , a more rigorous test of @xmath19 ability to resolve shifts is needed .    from the derived shifts we are able to determine the horizontal photospheric flow , @xmath20 .",
    "further , we can calculate the divergence of the velocity , @xmath21 , and the photospheric vorticity , @xmath22 .",
    "the g - band data series has a very high cadence at 0.96  s. however , the previously reported values for photospheric flows are @xmath23  kms@xmath4 , hence the expected shift between each frame is @xmath24 pixels . to improve accuracy , every eighth frame",
    "is then selected from the g - band series , increasing the cadence to 7.68  s and expected shifts to @xmath25 pixels ( @xmath26  kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "further , a sonic filter is applied to the data to suppress the influence of p - modes and stochastic variations in intensity .",
    "the data is then re - sampled using linear interpolation to achieve a pixel size of @xmath27  km@xmath28 .",
    "the lct is performed on frames chosen from the first sixty frames because the seeing during this period is relatively stable . for each data",
    "set that we apply lct to , the lct is preformed on many sub - regions of the overall image , with window sizes determined by the dominant features at that wavelength .",
    "a window size of @xmath29  pixel@xmath28 ( @xmath30  mm@xmath28 ) is used such that features on the order of the granulation will contribute to the cross - correlation .",
    "this , along with the apodization of the window , will reduce the effect of large intensity gradients on resolving shifts .    the @xmath31  mm@xmath28 boxed region in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov]a is selected ( close - up of this region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photflows ] left panel ) and subject to the lct algorithm .",
    "the photospheric flow is calculated over a 30 frame average , revealing long - lived flow patterns .",
    "the magnitude of the photospheric velocities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] . a histogram plot of the velocity distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] ) is in line with results from mbp tracking , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and from long - term flow measurements , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the velocity vectors and divergence are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] .",
    "the directions of the velocity vectors results are consistent with the flow direction as seen by a visual inspection of the g - band movie .",
    "evidence for vortices are present , with the velocity vectors marking out curved paths or arcs thought to be demonstrating the vortex behaviour .",
    "this is verified by calculating the vorticity from the horizontal velocity , which demonstrates that vorticity is present across the the photospheric region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] - bottom row , left panel ) .",
    "a histogram of vorticity values is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] and the values obtained here are in agreement with previous observational measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the motion of an individual mbp is tracked over twenty frames using a crude ( but efficient ) point and click method .",
    "the mbp selected lies directly under the chromospheric feature , which suggests it is the photospheric counterpart .",
    "the tracking of the individual bright point reveals the mbp follows an arc - shaped path across the photosphere , demonstrating the mbp is in the presence of a photospheric vortex .",
    "this is confirmed as the mbp is also seen to lie in a region of strong , negative vorticity in fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] .      to validate the results of the lct technique , we performed tests on a numerically simulated @xmath32-band image sequence .",
    "the synthetic data were produced using radiative diagnostics of the three - dimensional numerical model of magnetised lower solar atmosphere ( i.e. convection zone and photosphere ) generated by muram radiative mhd code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the domain size chosen is @xmath33 in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively , and the horizontal resolution is @xmath34 .",
    "the detailed @xmath32-band radiative diagnostics was carried out using the radiative transport code , designed for computationally efficient wide band filter calculations ( see , @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we have generated 800 @xmath32-band images of solar granulation with the average vertical magnetic flux of @xmath35 ( the value of magnetic field strength is consistent with recent observations , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the time cadence for the image sequence is about 2 seconds and not constant due to variation of the time step in the numerical simulation .    to provide a direct comparison with the observational analysis described in the previous section",
    ", the resolution of the simulated data is reduced to @xmath36  km , using every fourth frame to achieve a similar cadence .",
    "we apply the sonic filter and re - sample using linear interpolation to @xmath37  km .",
    "the lct results are averaged , again , over 30 frames .",
    "the results of lct on the simulated @xmath32-band image sequence demonstrate qualitatively similar plasma flow patterns in both the granular and intergranular regions to the observed data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] ) .",
    "the results from the simulated data show slightly greater values of divergence and vorticity .",
    "the absolute values of velocity and vorticity in the simulated data are plotted in a histogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] ) for direct comparison between the observed and synthesised g - band images .",
    "the distributions can be seen to be comparable although slight differences exist between the observed and simulated values .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the observed and simulated regions are inherently different regions , with an unknown quantity of magnetic flux in the observed region .",
    "some of the differences may also lie in the quality of the observed data .",
    "a measure of the difference in quality is the root mean squared contrast .",
    "the synthesised g - band images have a mean rms of @xmath38 , while the observed g - band images have a much lower mean rms of @xmath39 and much greater variation in rms between frames .",
    "the flow speeds in the simulations have also been measured at the geometrical height of approximately @xmath40 above the continuum formation level .",
    "they show the presence of the flow features similar to those detected by lct applied to the simulated @xmath32-band images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_mag_vel ] ) .",
    "however , due to measurement of the flow speeds at the constant geometrical height instead of at optical depth corresponding to the @xmath32-band radiation formation , only a qualitative comparison of these speeds with the speeds obtained by lct is valid and possible .",
    "the simulations are known to be replete with vortex motions .",
    "the agreement seen between lct results performed on the observed and simulated data gives us confidence that the photosphere also contains numerous vortex structures .",
    "torsional alfvn waves have been shown to be excited at the photospheric level in a number of numerical simulations .",
    "they are excited in magnetic photospheric vortex structures by random motions , such as granular flows ( see , for example , numerical simulations of photospheric magneto - convection , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and by synthetic photospheric torsional ( vortex - type ) drivers ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) in the idealised simulations of solar magnetic flux tubes .",
    "we note the magnetic vortex structures significantly differ in their nature and dynamics from the non - magnetic vortices ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they , and the torsional alfvn waves they produce , generate large amounts of poynting flux ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as has been shown by @xcite , the magnetic vortex structures expand from the photospheric level into the corona .",
    "they are suggested channels for electromagnetic energy to tunnel into the higher layers of the solar atmosphere and , therefore , such structures are considered as potential channels of energy transport for coronal heating .      on inspecting the h@xmath1 movie ,",
    "a torsional ( or rotational ) motion is observable in the area highlighted with the dashed box in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov]c .",
    "a chromospheric response to photospheric vortices has already been observed in high - resolution observations of the lower chromosphere ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so far , the reported chromospheric swirl events appear to demonstrate rotation in _ one _ direction only . here , the h@xmath1 region appears to first rotate in one direction and then rotate in opposite direction quasi - periodically .",
    "such behaviour has been observed in the intergranular vortices in realistic simulations of magneto - convection @xcite , as well as in the idealised simulations of flux tubes in the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "this would suggest the presence of torsional alfvn waves , which have also been identified previously in chromospheric features situated above mbps ( @xcite ) .    to demonstrate this behaviour ,",
    "lct is applied to the h@xmath1 data . before performing lct , the unsharp - mask ( usm ) technique",
    "is applied to the full field of view and the mask is subtracted .",
    "the mask is created using a box - car average of width 20 pixels .",
    "this technique has two benefits : _",
    "( i ) _ the removal of large spatial - scale intensity perturbations which could influence results ; _ ( ii ) _ an increased contrast between chromospheric features and the background . the intensity perturbations ( @xcite ) are removed from the time series because they are coherent over a large spatial - scale .",
    "further , an atrous spatial filtering algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ) is applied to each frame .",
    "the highest frequency component from the spatial filtering contains mainly noise , which is then subtracted to improve the signal to noise in each image .",
    "the torsional motion appears quasi - periodic with an apparent period between 120 - 180s , hence , the lct is averaged over sets of 9 consecutive frames .",
    "note , the period range given is based on the apparent rate at which the motion appears to change its direction of rotation .",
    "the time - series shows the rotation change directions a number of times over it s duration .",
    "this is calculated by eye from viewing the h@xmath1 time - series and we do not consider it a rigorous measurement of the period .",
    "the velocity vector plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : chromflows ] confirm the visual impression of torsional motion .",
    "the first vector plot is averaged over the frames in the range @xmath41  s and the second vector plot is averaged over @xmath42  s. these time ranges are used as they correspond to the times when the torsional motion is most evident .",
    "the torsional motion is centred on the region around @xmath43  mm in the plots and a zoom of this region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chromflows ] - bottom row ) reveals the signature of the torsional motion .",
    "the maximum values of the velocity amplitude of the torsional motion are @xmath44  kms@xmath4 with an average and standard deviation of @xmath45  kms@xmath4 .",
    "these values are essentially the time - averaged velocity amplitudes , while the peak amplitudes are likely greater as the peak value is a factor of @xmath46 greater than the time - averaged amplitude .",
    "the focus of this work is now shifted to the fine - scale structure that originates in the previously identified h@xmath1 region .",
    "the fine - scale structure we are interested in are the dark , absorption features , which are mainly elongated , inclined fibrils and a few mottles ( nearly vertical structures thought to be similar to spicules ) . on inspecting the movie of h@xmath1 , the fine - scale structure can be identified to exhibit transverse motion . the fibrils are rooted in the region where the torsional motion is observed and the torsional motion shakes the fibrils footpoints side to side , which drives the transverse waves . in this section",
    "we study the transverse waves supported by these structures and demonstrate new techniques for obtaining information about the waves .    to model these transverse waves ,",
    "the assumption is made that the waves are propagating along an over - dense , magnetic flux tube embedded in an ambient plasma environment .",
    "the speed at which these waves propagate is known as the kink speed , which is defined as , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the density and @xmath49 is the alfvn speed , @xmath50 is the magnetic field and @xmath51 is the magnetic permeability . here",
    ", we follow convention labelling internal and ambient plasma parameters with subscripts @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the first step in the analysis of the observed transverse waves is to apply the usm procedure to the h@xmath1 images .",
    "the orientation of the fine - scale structure is determined ( see dotted line over plotted on the h@xmath1 image , fig .",
    "[ fig : rosafov]c ) and a series of 42 cross - cuts , separated by 2 pixels , are placed perpendicular to their axis . from the cross - cuts ,",
    "time - distance plots are created , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skel ] .",
    "the time - distance plots clearly reveal the transverse motions of the fibril structures .",
    "next , to reduce the background noise , an atrous filtering algorithm is applied to the time - distance plots and the highest frequency component is subtracted .",
    "the individual , dark fibrils in each cross - cut are then located in the following manner .",
    "cross - sectional flux profiles of fibrils have an almost gaussian shape , with the minimum value of intensity at the centre of the fibril cross - section . for each time slice ,",
    "the pixels with the minimum intensity in a localised region are located .",
    "a gradient threshold is then applied allowing for isolated fibrils to be located .",
    "the gradient of the neighbouring 5 points on either side of the minimum value pixel is calculated and has to be larger than the threshold value for the minimum point to be selected .",
    "should two fibrils approach each other or begin to cross , the gradient becomes shallower around the minima .",
    "optimisation of the threshold level allows for a significant number of isolated fibrils to be identified ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skel]c ) , with the fibril paths in time being traced out .",
    "this method only locates the centre of the structure to within one pixel and hence has an error of @xmath54  km on each point .    for each fibril path identified at this stage , we then select only the paths that obey certain conditions :",
    "( i ) the path has to be longer than 5 pixels ; ( ii ) the maximum time separation between neighbouring points in the thread has to be less than 4 pixels ( @xmath55  s ) , the missing pixels are then recorded as having the same spatial position as that of the first of the time - separated neighbours ; ( iii ) points neighbouring in time can not be separated spatially by more than 4 pixels ( @xmath56  km ) .",
    "this last condition would limit any measured velocity amplitudes to @xmath57  kms@xmath4 .",
    "once we have selected the fibril paths , the results are then fitted with a levenberg - marquardt non - linear fitting algorithm ( mpfit.pro - @xcite ) .",
    "a function of the form @xmath58 is used to fit the oscillations . here , @xmath59 is a linear function , @xmath60 is the displacement amplitude of the oscillation , @xmath61 the frequency and @xmath62 the phase of the oscillation .",
    "the fitting algorithm is supplied with the errors on each data point , where it is assumed the given error is the one-@xmath63 uncertainty .",
    "the fitting routine also calculates the one-@xmath63 error to each fit parameter .",
    "the fitted results are kept if the threads are longer than @xmath64 and the errors on the fitted parameters are smaller than the magnitude of the parameter values .",
    "transverse velocity amplitudes for the waves can be obtained from the fit using the relation @xmath65 and errors in the velocity amplitude are calculated by summing in quadrature .    over the 42 cross - cuts a total of 1100 oscillations",
    "are measured .",

    "gives means and standard deviations of @xmath66  s , @xmath67  km and @xmath68  kms@xmath4 .",
    "it is also interesting to plot period versus displacement amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] - bottom row left panel ) .",
    "it is apparent that there is a direct relationship between transverse displacement amplitude and period .",
    "we perform a weighted linear fit to the data points , calculated with the levenberg - marquardt algorithm with the constraint the line passes through ( 0,0 ) .",
    "the result is over - plotted and the derived velocity amplitude from the trend is @xmath69  kms@xmath4 , in agreement with the mean value .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ( bottom row right panel ) the velocity amplitude as a function of period is shown .",
    "qualitatively the velocity amplitude appears relatively constant as a function of period , however , a weighted linear fit to the data points suggest the velocity amplitude decreases with period .",
    "this implies that the energy , which is proportional to the square of the velocity , contained within this frequency range of waves ( 2 - 30 mhz ) is approximately constant as a function of period .",
    "it is worth noting that the estimates of the temporal power spectra of the horizontal velocity of the photosphere by @xcite using the g - band filter of _ hinode / sot _ showed a change of trend in the log - log gradients of fourier power vs frequency at 4.7 mhz ( approximately 213  s period ) . for frequencies",
    "less than 4.7 mhz they found an @xmath70 relationship and for frequencies greater than 4.7 mhz it was @xmath71 .",
    "the derived photospheric power spectra , found by the method of lct were taken as a proxy for the actual photospheric driver of transverse waves for a numerical simulation by @xcite ( in their case the @xmath72 torsional alfvn wave and not the @xmath73 kink waves we observe here ) .",
    "a number of questions now arise , in comparing our measurements of transverse chromospheric velocity amplitude vs period measurements in chromospheric fibrils with the photospheric power spectra of @xcite .",
    "firstly , our results suggest that @xcite may have used the incorrect input power spectra , i.e. , we see no evidence of wave energy decreasing with decrease in period .",
    "this is particularly relevant for wave heating since , mechanisms such as resonant absorption , phase mixing and ion - neutral damping are all more efficient at higher frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "if the photospheric power spectra obtained by @xcite are a reasonable proxy for the driver of transverse waves , the output is notably different at chromospheric heights and must be explained by further study .",
    "we should note that all fits calculated here are under the assumption that the error in the period can be neglected over the error in the transverse displacement and velocity amplitudes .",
    "this may be justified as the mean error on the period , transverse displacement and velocity amplitudes are @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "tracking wave propagation through the lower layers of the solar atmosphere is an important step in being able to assess the viability of the various suggested mechanisms for atmospheric heating and solar wind acceleration . in section .",
    "4 we present observational evidence that photospheric vortices occur in the regions of strong magnetic flux concentrations .",
    "this is found to be in good agreement with the predictions of advanced models of solar magnet - convection .",
    "further , we provide evidence that demonstrates the photospheric vortices can excite torsional motions in the chromosphere .",
    "this is supported by previous results from various numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and previous observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observation of the vortex and torsional motions is achieved by exploiting lct to track the motions of both photospheric and chromospheric features and identifying the signatures in the resulting velocity vector plots .",
    "the chromospheric torsional motion appears periodic here ( unlike the uni - directional motion identified in swirl events , e.g. , @xcite ) , although we can not resolve the periodic behaviour explicitly .",
    "the vector plots demonstrate that the region rotates one way and , at a later time , in the opposite direction . a better way to obtain details on torsional waves may be to exploit spectroscopic observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further , the torsional motion is observed to excite transverse waves in the chromospheric fine - structure whose footpoints are rooted in the region .",
    "the fine - structure takes the form of elongated absorption features that are fibrils and a few shorter features , possibly mottles .",
    "the transverse velocity amplitudes of the transverse waves are comparable to the velocity amplitudes obtained from averaging of the torsional motion .",
    "the observations imply that the transverse waves are driven by the torsional motion , which in turn is driven by the photospheric vortices .",
    "the transfer of energy from photospheric vorticies to alfvn waves and chromospheric transverse waves has been demonstrated in numerical simulations of the lower solar atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the measured wave properties also reveal interesting information about the chromospheric waves .",
    "in particular , the measured velocity amplitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ) suggest that waves with periods in the range @xmath77  s have similar power .",
    "however , the results presented here are restricted to incompressible waves confined in one particular structure in the chromosphere .",
    "a more in depth study taking into account numerous chromospheric structures is required before more definite conclusions on this issue can be drawn .",
    "finally , we highlight here that our results have some limitations .",
    "the limitations are related to the inability to resolve small amplitude ( @xmath78  km ) transverse waves due to spatial resolution .",
    "the demonstrated relationship between displacement amplitude and period ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skel ] ) implies that spatial resolution also limits the ability to detect short period waves ( @xmath79  s ) . on the other end of the scale , the known lifetimes of the chromospheric structures ( i.e. , @xmath80  minutes ) also limits the observations of longer period waves ( @xmath81  s )",
    "this is reflected in the low number of observations of wave with longer periods .",
    "some of these limitations may be overcome if more advanced techniques are employed for wave tracking , e.g. , calculating sub - pixel displacements could reveal smaller amplitude wave phenomena .",
