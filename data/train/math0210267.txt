    "dimension_. we recall that nontrivial recurrence and hyperbolicity stand as principal mechanisms responsible for the existence of stochastic behavior .",
    "we  want to proceed from nontrivial recurrence and hyperbolicity , and discuss recent results in three areas of research : _ dimension theory _ , _ multifractal analysis _ , and _",
    "quantitative recurrence_. we present a global view of the topics under discussion , although the text substantially reflects a personal taste . in view of readability , instead of always presenting the most general results , we made a selection with the purpose of illustrating the main ideas while we avoid the accessory technicalities . furthermore , all the necessary notions from hyperbolic dynamics , ergodic theory , dimension theory , and the thermodynamic formalism are briefly recalled . we  apologize if some reference was overlooked , although if this happened it was of course totally unintentional .",
    "the notion of nontrivial recurrence goes back to poincar in his study of the three body problem .",
    "he proved in his celebrated memoir  @xcite of 1890 that whenever a dynamical system preserves volume almost all trajectories return arbitrarily close to their initial position and they do this an infinite number of times .",
    "this is poincar s recurrence theorem .",
    "the memoir is the famous one that in its first version ( printed in 1889 , even having circulated shortly , and of which some copies still exist today ) had the error that can be seen as the main cause for the study of chaotic behavior in the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "incidentally , poincar s recurrence theorem was already present in the first printed version of the memoir as then again in @xcite . already after the publication of  @xcite , the following was observed by poincar about the complexity caused by the existence of homoclinic points in the restricted three body problem ( as quoted for example in @xcite ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ one is struck by the complexity of this figure that i am not even attempting to draw .",
    "nothing can give us a better idea of the complexity of the three - body problem and of all the problems of dynamics in general  [ ... ] .",

    "we recommend @xcite .",
    "the study of hyperbolicity goes back to the seminal work of hadamard @xcite in 1898 concerning the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of a surface with negative curvature , in particular revealing the instability of the flow with respect to the initial conditions .",

    "a  considerable activity took place during the 1920 s and 1930 s in particular with the important contributions of hedlund and hopf who established several topological and ergodic properties of geodesic flows , also in the case of manifolds with not necessarily constant negative sectional curvature .",
    "we refer the reader to the survey @xcite for details and further references .",
    "also in @xcite hadamard laid the foundations for symbolic dynamics , subsequently developed by morse and hedlund and raised to a subject in its own right ( see in particular their work  @xcite of 1938 ; incidentally , this is where the expression `` symbolic dynamics '' appeared for the first time ) .      it should be noted that while the recurrence theorem of poincar is a fundamental result in the theory of dynamical systems , on the other hand it only provides information of qualitative nature . in particular , it gives no information about the frequency with which each trajectory visits a given set .",
    "this drawback was surpassed by birkhoff @xcite and von neumann @xcite who in 1931 established independently the first versions of the ergodic theorem . together with its variants and generalizations ,",
    "the ergodic theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of dynamical systems and in particular in ergodic theory ( one of the first appearances of the expression `` ergodic theory '' occured in 1932 in joint work of birkhoff and koopman @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ergodic theorem considers only one aspect of the quantitative behavior of recurrence .",
    "in particular , it gives no information about the rate at which a given trajectory returns arbitrarily close to itself .",
    "there has been a growing interest in the area during the last decade , particularly with the work of boshernitzan @xcite and ornstein and weiss @xcite .      in another direction , the dimension theory of dynamical systems progressively developed , during the last two decades , into an independent field .",
    "we emphasize that we are mostly concerned here with the study of dynamical systems , and in particular of their invariant sets and measures , from the point of view of dimension .",
    "the first comprehensive reference that clearly took this point of view is the book by pesin  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the dimension theory of dynamical systems is to measure the complexity from the dimensional point of view of the objects that remain invariant under the dynamical system , such as the invariant sets and measures .",
    "it turns out that the thermodynamic formalism developed by ruelle in his seminal work  @xcite has a privileged relation with the dimension theory of dynamical systems .",
    "the multifractal analysis of dynamical systems is a subfield of the dimension theory of dynamical systems .",
    "briefly , multifractal analysis studies the complexity of the level sets of invariant local quantities obtained from a dynamical system .",
    "for example , we can consider birkhoff averages , lyapunov exponents , pointwise dimensions , and local entropies .",
    "these functions are usually only measurable and thus their level sets are rarely manifolds . hence , in order to measure their complexity it is appropriate to use quantities such as the topological entropy or the hausdorff dimension .",
    "multifractal analysis has also a privileged relation with the experimental study of dynamical systems .",
    "more precisely , the so - called multifractal spectra obtained from the study of the complexity of the level sets can be determined experimentally with considerable precision . as such we may expect to be able to recover some information about the dynamical system from the information contained in the multifractal spectra .",
    "we first introduce in section  [ sec1 ] the fundamental concepts of ergodic theory and hyperbolic dynamics , and in particular nontrivial recurrence and hyperbolicity .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] is dedicated to the discussion of the concept of nonuniform hyperbolicity , that in particular includes the case of a dynamical system preserving a measure with all lyapunov exponents nonzero .",
    "this theory ( also called pesin theory ) is clearly recognized today as a fundamental step in the study of stochastic behavior .",
    "we consider hyperbolic measures in section  [ sec3 ] , i.e. , measures with all lyapunov exponents nonzero and describe their product structure that imitates the product structure observed on hyperbolic sets .",
    "we also discuss in section  [ sec3 ] the relation with the dimension theory of invariant measures .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is dedicated to the study of the dimension theory of invariant sets .",
    "this study presents complications of different nature from those in the dimension theory of invariant measures .",
    "in particular , the study of the dimension of invariant sets is often affected by number - theoretical properties .",
    "our emphasis here is on the study of the so - called geometric constructions which can be seen as models of invariant sets of dynamical systems .",
    "there is again a privileged relation with the thermodynamic formalism and we start to describe this relation in section  [ sec4 ] . section  [ sec5 ] is dedicated to the study of the dimension of invariant sets of hyperbolic dynamics , both invertible and noninvertible . in particular , we present the dimension formulas for repellers and hyperbolic sets in the case of conformal dynamics .",
    "symbolic dynamics plays a fundamental role in some studies of dimension and is also considered in section  [ sec5 ] . in particular",
    ", this allows us to model invariant sets by geometric constructions .",
    "multifractal analysis is the main theme of section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "we describe the interplay between local and global properties in the case of hyperbolic dynamics .",
    "we also present several examples of multifractal spectra and describe their properties .    in section  [ sec7 ]",
    "we discuss the properties of the set of points for which the birkhoff averages do not converge . in view of the ergodic theorem",
    "this set has zero measure with respect to any invariant measure , and thus it is very small from the point of view of measure theory . on the other hand ,",
    "it is rather large from the point of view of dimension theory and entropy theory .",
    "we also discuss how one can make rigorous a certain multifractal classification of dynamical systems .",
    "we discuss conditional variational principles in section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "these have a privileged relation with multifractal analysis : roughly speaking , the multifractal analysis of a given multifractal spectrum is equivalent to the existence of a corresponding conditional variational principle .",
    "we also discuss in section  [ sec8 ] how these variational principles and in particular their multi - dimensional versions have applications to certain problems in number theory . in section  [ sec9 ]",
    "we address the problem of quantitative recurrence allude to above .",
    "we also describe the product structure of return times thus providing an additional view of the product structure described before for invariant sets and invariant measure .",
    "we also briefly describe some applications to number theory .",

    "one of the paradigms of the theory of dynamical systems is that the local instability of trajectories influences the global behavior of the system and opens the way to the existence of stochastic behavior .",
    "mathematically , the instability of trajectories corresponds to some degree of hyperbolicity .",

    ". moreover , hyperbolicity is one of the main mechanisms responsible for the stochastic behavior in natural phenomena , even though not always with the presence of ( uniformly ) hyperbolic sets as defined above .",
    "these considerations justify the search for a `` weaker '' concept of hyperbolicity , present in a much more general class of dynamical systems that we will call _ nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems _ ( see section  [ sec2.1 ] ) .",
    "the study of these systems is much more delicate than the study of diffeomorphisms with hyperbolic sets and namely of anosov diffeomorphisms .",
    "however , it is still possible to establish the presence of a very rich structure and in particular the existence of families of stable and unstable manifolds ( see section  [ sec2.1 ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the concept of invariant measure , which constitutes another fundamental departure point for the study of stochastic behavior .",

    "the simultaneous existence of _ hyperbolicity _ and _ nontrivial recurrence _ ensures the existence of a very rich orbit structure .",

    "it may be necessary to use more than one multifractal spectrum in order to obtain a multifractal classification analogous to that given by theorem  [ t : chaos ] .",
    "this is one of the motivations for the study of other multifractal spectra and namely of the mixed spectra ( see sections  [ sec : general ] and  [ sec8.1 ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ sec : general ] , one can consider several other multifractal spectra and in particular the mixed spectra @xmath512 and @xmath513 .",

    "furthermore , they coincide with the legendre transform of certain functions , defined in terms of the topological pressure . in particular , this allows one to show that they are always convex .    in order to explain why the study of the mixed multifractal spectra is different from the study of the nonmixed spectra , we recall the level sets @xmath555 ( see section  [ sec : general ] ) .",

    "the corresponding multi - dimensional multifractal spectra exhibit several nontrivial phenomena that are absent in the one - dimensional case .",
    "furthermore , the known approaches to the study of one - dimensional multifractal spectra have to be modified to treat the new situation .",

    "<S> all the necessary notions from ergodic theory , hyperbolic dynamics , dimension theory , and the thermodynamic formalism are briefly recalled . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on uniformly hyperbolic dynamics , although we also refer to nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamics . instead of always presenting the most general results </S>",
    "<S> , we made a selection with the purpose of illustrating the main ideas while we avoid the accessory technicalities . </S>"
