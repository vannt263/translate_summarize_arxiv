    "passive optical networks ( pons ) have emerged over the past decade as a highly promising access network technology for connecting individual distributed optical network units ( onus ) at distributed subscriber premises to a central optical line terminal ( olt ) , see fig .",
    "[ arch : fig ] ,  @xcite .",
    "recent advances in the underlying photonic and physical layer communications technologies and commensurate standardization efforts have paved the way for pons operating at a channel bandwidth of 10  gbps ( compared to the 1  gbps bandwidth considered in early pon development ) , cf .",
    "ieee 802.3av  @xcite and g.987  @xcite . also , long - reach pons operating up to distances of 100  km between the distributed onus and the central olt have emerged  @xcite .",
    "operating at high bandwidth over long distances , i.e. , with a high bandwidth - delay product , poses significant challenges for coordinating the upstream transmissions of the distributed onus so as to avoid collisions on the shared upstream ( from onus to olt ) channel . as reviewed in section  [ lit : sec ] , a wide array of dynamic bandwidth allocation ( dba ) mechanisms have been developed to solve this medium access control problem on the upstream channel for bursty onu packet traffic .",
    "the dba mechanisms operate commonly within the context of the standardized signaling mechanisms for pons which are based on a cyclical report - grant polling structure , which is illustrated in fig  [ fig : cycle_illu ] . more specifically ,",
    "onus signal their queue depths , i.e. , current bandwidth demands , with a control ( report ) message to the olt .",
    "the olt then sets the sizes ( lengths ) of the upstream transmission windows ( grants ) for the individual onus and signals the length and starting time ( schedule ) of each transmission window to the individual onus through grant messages , which are represented by the downward arrows in fig  [ fig : cycle_illu ] .",
    "in particular , the ethernet pon ( epon ) employs the report and gate messages of the multi - point control protocol ( mpcp ) according to the ieee 802.3ah or 802.3av standards .",
    "the gigabit pon ( gpon ) employs dynamic bandwidth reports upstream ( dbru ) for signaling the queue depths and bandwidth maps ( bwmaps ) for signaling the upstream transmission windows following the g.984 or g.987 standards  @xcite .",
    "the report message from an onu is typically lumped together with the upstream payload data transmission so as to avoid extra guard times for the short report message . while the epon standard leaves the position of the report message within an onu s upstream transmission open",
    ", the vast majority of epon studies have assumed that the report message is positioned at the very end of an onu s upstream transmission , after the onu s payload data transmissions .",
    "this `` reporting at the end '' allows the onu to signal the most up - to - date queue depth , at ideally the time instant of the end of the payload transmission , to the olt . on the other hand",
    ", the gpon standard specifies that the report message be included at the beginning of the upstream transmission , i.e. , to precede the payload data  @xcite .",
    "this `` reporting at the beginning '' has the advantage that the olt receives the report message earlier ( i.e. , before the onus payload data ) and can already size and schedule the transmission windows for the next cycle . on the downside , the report at the beginning does not contain the packets that were newly generated during the onu s payload transmission .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "the impact of the report message scheduling at the beginning or end of an onu s upstream transmission has not yet been investigated in detail . in this article",
    "we examine this open research question in the context of both epons and gpons operating at either 1  gbps or 10  gbps channel bandwidth for state - of - the - art dba mechanisms .",
    "we analyze the channel idle time with reporting at the beginning or end for the different dba mechanisms .",
    "we show that reporting at the beginning can reduce the channel idle time that precedes the arrival of an onu upstream transmission at the olt by up to the transmission time of an onu s payload compared to reporting at the end .",
    "we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the average packet delay .",
    "we find that reporting at the beginning significantly reduces the packet delay for dba mechanisms that accumulate all reports from a cycle for offline transmission window sizing and scheduling .",
    "in contrast , dba mechanisms that size and schedule transmission windows online or employ interleaving strategies for the cyclic polling processes , perform equally well for both reporting at the beginning or end .",
    "this article is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ lit : sec ] discusses the background and related work . in section  [ con : sec ] , we analyze the channel idle time for reporting at the beginning and identify the reduction in channel idle time compared to reporting at the end . in section  [ perf : sec ] , we present extensive simulation results comparing reporting in the beginning and end for 1  gbps and 10  gbps epon and gpon . in section  [ concl : sec ] , we summarize our observations and outline future research directions .    , to a central olt in the pon structure . the @xmath0 onus share a single wavelength channel with bit rate @xmath1 bit / s for their upstream transmissions and",
    "have one - way propagation delay @xmath2 to the olt . ]",
    "efficient control of the access by the distributed onus to the shared upstream channel so as to serve bursty traffic with low delay while avoiding collisions is one of the key challenges in operating a pon  @xcite . several dynamic bandwidth allocation ( dba )",
    "approaches have been developed for this channel access problem .",
    "a primary classification criterion for dba mechanisms is the number of polling threads employed per onu .",
    "single - thread polling ( stp )  @xcite employs one polling thread per onu , while multi - thread polling ( mtp )  @xcite employs multiple polling threads .",
    "the polling threads may operate in offline fashion , i.e. , collect report messages from all onus before sizing and scheduling the upstream transmission windows , or make these decisions in online fashion after the receipt of each individual report message  @xcite .    the vast majority of the existing studies on dba in pons has considered reporting at the end of the upstream transmission .",
    "reporting at the beginning has only briefly been considered for stp with elementary gated grant sizing in  @xcite and for mtp in  @xcite .",
    "also , the channel idle time has so far only been analyzed for reporting at the end of an upstream transmission in  @xcite .",
    "the present study provides the first analysis of the channel idle time for reporting at the beginning of an onu upstream transmission as well as a detailed examination of the impact of the report message scheduling at beginning vs. end of an upstream transmission on the channel idle time and packet delay for a wide range of dba mechanisms .",
    "pons with 1  gbps channel bandwidth were standardized a decade ago as epon in ieee  802.3ah  @xcite and as gpon in itu - t  g.984  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "corresponding standards for 10  gbps channel bandwidth were established only recently as 10g - epon in ieee 802.3av  @xcite and as xg - pon in itu - t g.987  @xcite . as a result , dba mechanisms for 10  gbps epon or xg - pon have yet to receive significant attention from the research community .",
    "several comparisons of the physical layer and link layer overhead differences among the various 1  gbps and 10  gbps standards have appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "some early investigations of dba mechanisms for the 10  gbps standards have been reported in  @xcite . the impact of the polling cycle time in single - thread polling with limited grant sizing on various performance measures , e.g. , packet delay and jitter , for each of the 1  gbps and 10  gbps standardized pon variants was studied in  @xcite .",
    "mechanisms to increase tcp throughput for 10  g - epon were studied in  @xcite . a modification to an existing dba algorithm to support a mixed network of both 1  gbps and 10  gbps epon onus was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "efficient utilization of unused bandwidth for xg - pon was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this article augments this relatively small body of literature by investigating the impact of the reporting position on performance measures for each of the 1  gbps and 10  gbps standardized pon variants .",
    "in this section we analyze the idle time on the upstream channel of a pon before each upstream transmission .",
    "we consider a pon model with a total number of @xmath0 onus , whereby onu @xmath3 , has a one - way propagation delay of @xmath2 [ s ] to the olt . the @xmath0 onus share the upstream wavelength channel with bit rate @xmath1 [ bit / s ] , as illustrated in fig  [ arch : fig ] .",

    "this case occurs if the signaling delay for onu transmission @xmath17 of thread @xmath11 in cycle @xmath4 is not masked by the preceding onu transmission .",
    "such an unmasked idle time can occur if the preceding onu transmission is too short to mask the gate signalling delay . or the polling structure introduces a mandatory idle time that can not be masked by a preceding transmission . for instance , offline scheduling requires the receipt of the report from the last onu transmission ( @xmath45 ) in cycle @xmath33 before sizing and scheduling the grants for cycle @xmath4 .",
    "that is , the first onu transmission ( @xmath46 ) in a cycle @xmath4 , is preceded by the last onu transmission of the preceding cycle and consequently , the time instant of the end of the preceding onu transmission is @xmath47 , see table  [ om : tab ] , which coincides with the scheduling instant @xmath48 , see table  [ gam : tab ] for reporting at the end .",

    "specifically , the unmasked idle time can be reduced by @xmath51 , i.e. , the transmission time for the payload in the last onu ( @xmath45 ) transmission in cycle @xmath33 .",
    "the intermediate case is that @xmath52 while @xmath53 in this case , the maximum in the first line of ( [ di : eqn ] ) is attained by the term involving @xmath54 , while the maximum in the second line is attained by @xmath5 .",

    "the individual upstream transmission durations are relatively small compared to the overall duration of a polling cycle , resulting in minimal potential for improvements due to optimized report message scheduling .",
    "as noted in section  [ opt : sec ] , for online scheduling , optimized report message scheduling is not possible . intuitively , with online scheduling , the last onu upstream transmission @xmath45 in a cycle is not followed by a @xmath50 idle period .",
    "thus , there would be no benefit from reporting at the beginning for the last onu @xmath45 .",
    "for the 20  km range epon , we observe from figs .",
    "[ fig : od-1g-32o_20 ] and  [ fig : it-1g-32o_20 ] that for the offline dba approaches , similar to the observations for the long - range epon , reporting at the beginning reduces the mean packet delays and idle times compared to reporting at the end .",
    "optimized report message scheduling reduces delays and idle times compared to reporting at the beginning only very slightly for offline gated grant sizing . for the short - range epon ,",
    "the mean idle times are generally quite low , see fig .",
    "[ fig : it-1g-32o_20 ] ; thus there is little potential to reduce idle times through optimized report scheduling .",
    "note in particular that for the 20  km epon with a round - trip propagation delay of approximately @xmath64  ms an equal share of the maximum cycle duration , i.e. , @xmath65 , can mask a substantial portion of the @xmath50 for @xmath66 and 4  ms and all of @xmath67 for @xmath68  ms .",
    "we conclude therefore that for short - range pons , reporting at the beginning is an effective method for masking the @xmath67 idle time between successive cycles in offline scheduling , especially for pons with long cycle durations .",

    "<S> a wide array of dynamic bandwidth allocation ( dba ) mechanisms have recently been proposed for improving bandwidth utilization and reducing idle times and packets delays in passive optical networks ( pons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dba evaluation studies commonly assumed that the report message for communicating the bandwidth demands of the distributed optical network units ( onus ) to the central optical line terminal ( olt ) is scheduled for the end of an onu s upstream transmission , after the onu s payload data transmissions . in this article , we conduct a detailed investigation of the impact of the report message scheduling ( rms ) , either at the beginning ( i.e. , before the pay load data ) or the end of an onu upstream transmission on pon performance . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically characterize the reduction in channel idle time with reporting at the beginning of an upstream transmission compared to reporting at the end . </S>",
    "<S> our extensive simulation experiments consider both the ethernet passive optical networking ( epon ) standard and the gigabit pon ( gpon ) standard . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for dbas with offline sizing and scheduling of onu upstream transmission grants at the end of a polling cycle , which processes requests from all onus , reporting at the beginning gives substantial reductions of mean packet delay at high loads . for high - performing dbas with online grant sizing and scheduling , which immediately processes individual onu requests , or interleaving of onus groups , </S>",
    "<S> both reporting at the beginning or end give essentially the same average packet delays .    </S>",
