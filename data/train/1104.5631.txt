    "recent work includes analysis of counting statistics in atom lasers@xcite , establishing hanbury - brown - twiss effect for both bosons and fermions@xcite , analysis of quantum states in optical lattices@xcite , observation of momentum correlations in fermi gases with pairing@xcite and investigation of thermal and quantum fluctuations in one and two dimensional condensates@xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that analysis of quantum noise should also be a powerful tool for analyzing non - equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated systems . here",
    "we study the two equivalent dynamical phenomena ; one given by the interaction induced decoherence dynamics in ramsey type interferometer sequences for two component bose mixtures in one dimension@xcite , and another given by the evolution of interference patterns of two one dimensional condensate created through the splitting of a single condensate@xcite .",
    "we obtain a complete time evolution of the full distribution function of the amplitude of ramsey fringes or interference patterns . in the case of ramsey fringes , the average amplitude of ramsey fringes measures only the average value of the transverse spin component . on the other hand , full distribution functions are determined by higher order correlation functions of the spins .",
    "hence full distribution functions contain considerably more information about the time evolution of the system@xcite and provide a powerful probe for the nature of the quantum dynamics under study . in particular , we use the simple expressions of full distribution functions to demonstrate the phenomena of `` prethermalization '' in these one dimensional systems , where observables in non - equilibrium long - time transient states become indistinguishable from those in thermal equilibrium states .",
    "one dimensional systems with continuous symmetries , including superfluids and magnetic systems , have a special place in the family of strongly correlated systems .",
    "quantum and thermal fluctuations are so extreme that long range order is not possible in equilibrium .",
    "such systems can not be analyzed using standard mean - field approaches , yet they can be studied through the application of methods specific to one dimension such as exact bethe ansatz solutions@xcite , effective description using tomonaga - luttinger and sine - gordon models@xcite , and numerical analysis using density - matrix renormalization group(dmrg ) and matrix product state ( mps ) methods@xcite .",
    "such systems are often considered as general paradigms for understanding strongly correlated systems .",
    "one dimensional systems also give rich examples of integrable systems , where due to the existence of infinite number of conserved quantities , equilibration does not take place@xcite .",
    "hence the problem we consider in this paper is important for understanding fundamental issues such as the quantum dynamics of strongly correlated systems and equilibration / non - equilibration of many - body systems , as well as for possible applications of spinor condensates in spectroscopy , interferometry , and quantum information processing @xcite .",

    "et al._@xcite who used two hyperfine states of @xmath0rb atoms confined in 2d arrays of one dimensional tubes to perform ramsey type interferometer sequences .",
    "they observed rapid decoherence of ramsey fringes and the near absence of spin echo .",
    "their results could not be explained within the single mode approximation which assumes a macroscopic bose condensation into a single orbital state , but could be understood in terms of the multi - mode tomonaga - luttinger type model . yet",
    "the enhanced decoherence rate and suppression of spin echo do not provide unambiguous evidences for what the origin of decoherence is . in this paper , we suggest that the crucial evidence of the multi - mode dynamics as a source of decoherence should come from the time evolution of the full distribution functions of the ramsey fringe amplitude .",
    "such distribution functions should be accessible in experiments on atom chips@xcite from the analysis of shot - to - shot fluctuations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : qualitative ] , we describe the dynamics of ramsey sequence and define the distribution functions for spins , the central objects we study in this paper .",
    "then , we give a short summary of the central results of this paper . in section [ section : hamiltonian ] , we formally give the hamiltonian of the one dimensional system based on tomonaga - luttinger approach .",
    "in section [ section : nomix ] , we derive the analytical expression for the time evolution of the full distribution function for a simple case in which charge and spin degrees of freedom decouple .",

    "such mixing introduces the dependence of spin distribution functions on the initial temperature of the system .",
    "the dynamics of ramsey sequence with two component bosons is mathematically equivalent to the dynamics of the interference of split one dimensional condensates , and we describe the mapping between these systems in section [ section : interference ] . in section [ section :",
    "prethermalization ] , we demonstrate the phenomenon of prethermalization and show that the interference contrasts of split condensates in a steady state have indistinguishable distributions from those of thermal condensates at some effective temperature @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude in section [ section : conclusion ] with a discussion of possible extensions of this work .",
    "in this paper , we study the dynamics of one dimensional , interacting two - component bose mixtures in the ramsey - type sequence . in analogy with spin-@xmath2 particles , we refer to one component to be spin - up and the other component to be spin - down . in the experiment of cold atoms in ref @xcite ,",
    "two hyperfine states are used for these two components . in the following ,",
    "we consider a generic situation where there is no symmetry that relates spin - up and spin - down .",
    "in particular , unlike fermions with spin-@xmath2 , there is no su@xmath3 symmetry . in a typical experimental setup with cold atoms ,",
    "there is a harmonic confinement potential along the longitudinal direction of condensates , but here we assume the absence of such a harmonic trap potential .",
    "our consideration gives a good approximation for the central region of cold atom experiments in the presence of such potentials .",
    "ramsey - type sequence is described as follows(figure [ ramsey ] ) :    1 .",
    "all atoms are prepared in spin up state at low temperature 2 .",
    "@xmath4 pulse is applied to rotate the spin of each atom into the @xmath5 direction 3 .",
    "spins evolve for time @xmath6 4 .",
    "spins in the transverse direction ( @xmath7 plane ) are measured    in a typical experimental situations@xcite , the last measurement step is done by applying a @xmath4 pulse to map the transverse spin component into @xmath8 direction , which then can be measured . in the following discussions ,",
    "we describe the dynamics in the rotating frame of larmer frequency in which the chemical potentials of spin - up and spin - down are the same in the absence of interactions . in this frame , the evolution of spins in the third step is dictated by the diffusion dynamics coming from interactions . unlike the conventional use of the ramsey sequence in the context of precision measurements , here we employ the ramsey sequence as a probe of correlation functions in one dimensional system .",
    "the description of the spin dynamics starts from the highly excited state prepared after the @xmath4 pulse of step 2 .",
    "the subsequent dynamics during step 3 crucially depends on the nature of excitations in the system .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of two - component bose mixture in one dimension is quite different from those in three dimension . in three dimensions ,",
    "bosons form a bose - einstein condensate(bec ) at low temperature , and particles occupy a macroscopic number of @xmath9 mode . then , the spin diffusion of three dimensional bec is dominated by the _ spatially homogeneous _ dynamics coming from the single @xmath9 mode at sufficiently low temperatures . on the other hand , bosonic systems in one dimension",
    "do not have the macroscopic occupancy of the @xmath9 mode , and their physics is dominated by the strong fluctuations , to the extent that the system can not retain the long range phase coherence even at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "thus , the spin dynamics of one dimensional bosonic system necessarily involves a large number of modes with different momenta and the spin becomes _ spatially inhomogeneous _ during the step 3 above .",
    "such dynamics unique to one dimension can be probed through the observation of transverse spin components in the fourth step .",
    "since we aim to capture the multi - mode nature of the dynamics in one dimension , we consider the observation of spins at length scale @xmath10 , given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 are the transverse components of spin operators after time evolution of step @xmath14 of duration @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is much larger than the spin healing length @xmath15 , and much smaller than the system size @xmath16 to avoid finite size effects .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the number of particles within the length @xmath10 , @xmath17 , is large , so that the simultaneous measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in principle possible . for large @xmath17 , the non - commutativity of @xmath20 and @xmath21 gives corrections of the order of @xmath22 compared to the average values .",
    "in this situation , it is also possible to measure the magnitude of transverse spin components , @xmath23 , which we will extensively study in the later sections .    due to quantum and thermal fluctuations ,",
    "the measurements of @xmath24 give different values from shot - to - shot .",
    "after the @xmath4 pulse of step 2 , the spins are prepared in @xmath5 direction , so the average value yields @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the rotating frame of larmer frequency ,",
    "the subsequent evolution does not change the expectation value of the @xmath27 component so that @xmath28 throughout .",
    "the decay of the average @xmath29 during the evolution in step 3 tells us the strength of spin diffusion in the system .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath30 due to spin diffusion are similar for one and three dimensions , and the difference is quantitative , rather than qualitative . on the other hand , a richer information about the dynamics of one dimensional system",
    "is contained in the noise of @xmath24 .",
    "such noise inherent to quantum systems is captured by higher moments @xmath31 . in this paper",
    ", we obtain the expression for the full distribution function @xmath32 which can produce any moments of @xmath24 through the relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the probability that the measurement of @xmath24 gives the value between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will see in section [ section : nomix ] that it is also possible to obtain the joint distributions @xmath37 of @xmath18 and @xmath19 as well as the distribution @xmath38 of the squared transverse magnitude @xmath39 .",
    "now we summarize the main results of this paper , and give a qualitative description of spin dynamics in the ramsey sequence .",
    "elementary excitations of spin modes in the system are described in terms of linearly dispersing spin waves with momenta @xmath40 and excitation energies @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the spin wave velocity .",
    "when certain symmetry conditions are satisfied(see discussion in section [ section : nomix ] ) , spin and charge degrees of freedom decouple , and these spin waves are free and they do not interact among themselves in the low energy descriptions within so - called tomonaga - luttinger theory@xcite .",
    "here , we describe the result in this decoupling limit , but the qualitative picture does not change even after the coupling between spin and charge is introduced , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ section : mix ] .",
    "the initial state prepared after @xmath4 pulse in step 2 in which all spins point in the @xmath5 direction is far from the equilibrium state of the system because interactions of spins are not symmetric in terms of spin rotations .",
    "thus , the initial state contains many excitations and the subsequent dynamics of spins is determined by time evolution of the spin waves . a spin wave excitation with momentum",
    "@xmath40 rotates spins with length scale @xmath43 and time scale @xmath44 .",
    "the amplitude of fluctuations coming from the spin wave with momentum @xmath40 is determined by the initial state as well as the nature of spin wave excitations .",
    "we find that the energy stored in each mode is approximately the same(see discussion in sec .",
    "[ section : interpretation ] ) , thus the amplitude of fluctuations for wave vector @xmath40 scales as @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation of spins is weak at short wave lengths and short times , and strong at long wave lengths and long times . in fig.[illustration ] , we illustrate such dynamics of spins due to fluctuations of spin wave excitations .",
    "it leads to the distributions presented in fig.[fig : figure1 ] and fig.[fig : jointdist ] . here",

    "all the spins are aligned in the @xmath5 direction , so the distribution of @xmath39 is a delta function peak at its maximum value , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the average density of spin - up or spin - down .",
    "the evolution of spin waves lead to the fluctuations of spins and thus to the decay of the integrated magnitude of the transverse spin .",
    "how the spin waves affect the integrated magnitude of spins strongly depends on the wavelength of the excitations .",
    "spin excitations with momenta much smaller than @xmath52 do not affect @xmath39 since these spin waves rotate the spins within @xmath10 as a whole , while spin excitations with higher momenta lead to the decay of the magnitude .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the @xmath5 component of the spin @xmath53 , which receives contributions from spin waves of all wavelengths .    as a result of different contributions of spin wave excitations with different wavelengths to the integrated spin magnitude , there are two distinct behaviors of the distributions of @xmath39 ; one for short integration length @xmath10 , which we call `` spin diffusion regime '' and another for long integration length @xmath10 , which we call `` spin decay regime . ''    for short integration length @xmath10 , the distribution function of @xmath39",
    "is always peaked near its maximum value @xmath54 during the dynamics because the strengths of fluctuations coming from spin waves with high momenta are suppressed by @xmath45(fig.[fig : figure1 ] , @xmath55 ) .",
    "while the magnitude of spins does not decay in this regime , fluctuations still lead to a diffusion of @xmath56 , thus , we call this regime the `` spin diffusion regime . ''",
    "on the other hand , for long integration length , spin waves lead to fluctuations of the spins within the integration region , and the spins are randomized after a long time .",
    "this randomization of spins leads to the development of a gaussian - like peak near @xmath57(fig.[fig : figure1 ] , @xmath58 ) . during the intermediate time ,",
    "both peaks at @xmath59 and the maximum value @xmath54 are present , and one can observe the double peak structure . because of the strong decaying behavior of the magnitude of spin , we call this regime the `` spin decay regime . ''",
    "more complete behaviors of distribution functions can be captured by looking at the joint distribution functions from which we can read off the distributions of both @xmath39 and @xmath56 , see fig.[fig : jointdist]@xcite . in the `` spin diffusion regime '' with short @xmath10 ,",
    "the joint distributions form a `` ring '' during the time evolution , whereas in the `` spin decay regime '' with long @xmath10 , they form a `` disk''-like structure in the long time limit . as we will see later",

    "we emphasize that in three dimensions , spin waves are dominated by @xmath9 mode and therefore , there is almost no decay in the magnitude of spins throughout the dynamics .",

    "it is easy to check that the sound velocity and luttinger parameters for each condensate is related to those of the difference mode ( see eqs.([phasedifference]-[interaction ] ) ) as @xmath483 and @xmath484 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath485    now the crucial observation is that our closed form expressions for distributions of interference contrasts of both split quasi - condensates and thermal quasi - condensates are determined solely by @xmath345 , and they take precisely the same form in terms of @xmath345 .",
    "moreover , the expressions given by eq.([longtimefluctuation ] ) and eq.([hightempfluctuation ] ) have the same dependence on wave vectors @xmath486 .",

    "is strongly constrained due to the conservation of energy and momentum , and therefore it is likely that the dynamics is dominated by the modes described by tomonaga - luttinger theory for long time for quasi - condensates with low initial temperatures .",
    "such prethermalizations are expected to occur even in higher dimensional systems@xcite .",
