    "in the field of genetics , much attention has been given to gene duplication and its significance in the evolution of organisms @xcite .",
    "whole genome duplication ( wgd ) , in view of its large scale , is considered to be one of the most significant evolutionary events .",
    "a well - known example is that the ancestor of vertebrate species went through at least two wgds @xcite 500800 million years ago @xcite . in the lineage of fish ,",
    "one more wgd ( teleost - specific wgd or ts - wgd ) is estimated to have occurred in the ancestor of teleosts 300400 million years ago @xcite .",
    "wgd generates functionally identical copies of genes in a genome , resulting in a situation in which either of the duplicate genes becomes a spare or dispensable gene .",
    "it is considered that , after such an expansion of genes by wgd , many of the redundant partners become pseudogenes by degenerative mutations @xcite and will be finally lost in the course of evolution .",
    "simultaneously , for some gene pairs , the functional redundancy may be lost by chance due to some mutations . in such cases ,",
    "either or both of the duplicate genes become to have novel roles that are different from the original one @xcite , and thereby both of them become to evolve mainly under purifying selection . actually , many cases of the functional differentiation in duplicate genes have been reported @xcite .",
    "in addition , many theoretical studies have investigated gene duplication from the view of population genetics @xcite , but studies based on the assessment of large - scale data have not been fully done . recently , a quantitative comparison among teleost genes was performed at the genomic level , which provided significant implications about the evolutionary fate of duplicate genes after wgd @xcite . in particular",
    ", the result showed that the loss of redundant genes generated by ts - wgd was very rapid with more than 70% of gene pairs becoming single during 60 million years , after which the rate of gene loss was very slow . in the present study ,",
    "i propose a simple mathematical model to explain the gene loss patterns observed after wgd .",
    "the model is parameterized taking into account an equilibrium between two evolutionary scenarios for duplicate genes : i ) rapid loss under functional dispensability to each other , and ii ) moderate occurrence of functional differentiation to each other .",
    "additionally , slow gene loss in a conservative manner , in which purifying selection is dominant , is parameterized in the model . in this study ,",
    "i applied the equilibrium model to the recent data derived from a comparison of teleost genes at the genomic level @xcite , showed that the model explained the data well , and discussed the potential of the model to assess the impact of wgd on all the genes in the organisms which went through wgds .",
    "in the equilibrium model , three parameters are defined : @xmath0 , for the rate of loss of a functionally redundant partner in a duplicate gene pair ; @xmath1 , for the rate of functional differentiation in a duplicate gene pair ; and @xmath2 , for the rate of loss of non - redundant genes .",
    "two types of non - redundant genes are considered : i ) single genes that have lost their partners and ii ) genes that have functionally differentiated in a pair .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is associated with the normal process of gene evolution under purifying selection , and the value can also be computed in other studies regardless of the context of gene duplication .",
    "it should be noted that functional differentiation  events can occur through mechanisms such as neofunctionalization , subfunctionalization , or dosage selection @xcite .",
    "such mechanisms are not distinguished in the model ; all of them may be included in the value of @xmath1 , and functional differentiation  is rather defined as any event in which the type of natural selection acting on genes is switched ( i.e. , from relaxed selection to purifying selection ) . in the model , i assumed that the loss of duplicate genes occurs one - by - one ; that is , both duplicate genes are not lost at the same time .",
    "all the possible states of a gene pair and the corresponding model parameters are summarized in figure 1 .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    in addition , i defined three probabilities , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , where @xmath3 is the probability that both duplicate genes in a pair remain at time @xmath6 ( state = pair ) , @xmath4 is the probability that either of the duplicate genes in a pair is lost at time @xmath6 ( state = single ) , and @xmath5 is the probability that both duplicate genes in a pair are lost at time @xmath6 ( state = none ) . here , @xmath7 is the time point at which wgd occurred . in the state of pair ,  each of the gene pairs is in either of two states , functionally redundant  and functionally differentiated  ( figure 1 ) , and hence @xmath3 is given by@xmath8 in addition , these probabilities satisfy the following differential equations:@xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 . solving these equations , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are represented as follows:@xmath12,\\\\ p_{none}(t )   & = 1+\\frac{1}{\\left (   \\alpha+\\beta-\\gamma\\right )   ^{2}}[\\gamma\\left (   \\alpha-\\gamma\\right )   e^{-\\left (   \\alpha+\\beta\\right )   t}\\\\ & -\\{\\left (   \\alpha+\\beta\\right )   ^{2}-\\gamma\\left (   \\alpha+2\\beta\\right ) + \\beta\\gamma\\left (   \\alpha+\\beta-\\gamma\\right )   t\\}e^{-\\gamma t}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be noted that @xmath13 converges to @xmath14 at @xmath15 when @xmath16 , indicating that the loss of gene pairs and the functional differentiation of duplicate genes have reached an equilibrium state . in this study , however , @xmath2 is larger than zero ; therefore , @xmath13 continues to decrease and finally converges to zero at @xmath15 .",
    "the equilibrium model was applied to the teleost fish data published by inoue et al .",
    "these data include information for duplicate genes in a total of 6892 pairs , which were chosen based on a comparison among teleost and outgroup genome data @xcite .",
    "the genes in these pairs are orthologous among nine teleosts ( mexican tetra , zebrafish , atlantic cod , nile tilapia , platyfish , medaka , stickleback , greenpuffer , and fugu ) , and the conservation or loss of duplicate genes in each of the genomes is recorded in the original data ( figure 2a ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 were fitted using the equation of @xmath17 according to the numbers of gene pairs that were estimated to have been present or were now present at 10 time points ( i.e. , nodes or edges in the phylogenetic tree ) ( @xmath18 , and @xmath19 million years , @xmath20 is the time of the ts - wgd , and @xmath7 is the present ) . from the original data , i counted the numbers of gene pairs that were completely lost in each of the nine teleost genomes ; the average was @xmath21 pairs ( table 1 ) .",
    "the fitting was done by the primal - dual interior point method @xcite implemented in mathematica ver .",
    "11 ( wolfram research , illinois , usa ) under the constraint of @xmath22 . as a result , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 were estimated to be 0.044 , 0.0076 , and 0.00078 , respectively .",
    "the behavior of @xmath13 was well matched to that of the actual data ( figure 3a )        and comparable to that of a recent model @xcite , suggesting that the equilibrium model is a worthy alternative model .",
    "in particular , the equilibrium model is consistent with the observation that a substantial number of gene pairs ( @xmath23 in average ) were lost in the extant teleost genomes . in the previous model ,",
    "single genes that had lost their partners were assumed to be indispensable for the teleost ; therefore , single genes will never be further lost .",
    "such an assumption seems to be inconsistent with the actual data .",
    "[ c]ll + & number of lost gene pairs + & @xmath24 + zebrafish & @xmath25 + atlantic cod & @xmath26 + nile tilapia & @xmath27 + platyfish & @xmath28 + medaka & @xmath29 + stickleback & @xmath30 + greenpuffer & @xmath31 + fugu & @xmath32 + @xmath33sd & @xmath34 +    the estimated @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 parameters were further corrected taking into account a feature of the original data , namely the data were composed of genes that are still present in at least one of the nine teleost genomes .",
    "for example , gene pairs that were completely lost during the period of @xmath35 are never transmitted to the teleost genomes examined ( figure 2a ) ; therefore , these pairs should not be counted in the original data .",
    "in addition , parallel gene losses in descending sister lineages after the divergence at @xmath36 will make the state pair  untraceable , resulting in the underestimation of gene pairs ( figure 2b ) .",
    "first , the true number of gene pairs to be observed at the time of ts - wgd was defined as @xmath37 .",
    "for the extant gene pairs in the original data , the equation is@xmath38 next , two conditional probabilities , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , were defined : i ) the probability that when a gene pair is in the state pair  at time @xmath41 , either of the duplicate genes will be lost at time @xmath42 ; and ii ) the probability that when a gene pair is in the state pair  at time @xmath41 , both duplicate genes in the pair will be lost at time @xmath42 .",
    "these conditional probabilities are given by@xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "using these probabilities , the ratio of gene pairs that will be underestimated by parallel gene losses between a node of time @xmath6 and two descending sister nodes or edges @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( times , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) is given by@xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "note that there are seven patterns of parallel gene loss causing the underestimation of gene pairs in the state pair  ( figure 2b ) , which correspond to one of @xmath52 , two of @xmath53 , two of @xmath54 , and two of @xmath55 . in the case of the last nodes ( @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) , which are followed by edges , the ratio of underestimation by parallel gene loss is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the numbers of gene pairs counted in these nodes were corrected to @xmath59 .",
    "contrastingly , in the case of the deeper nodes ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , which are followed by at least one node , the patterns of parallel gene loss are much more complicated .",
    "for the deeper nodes , i first performed the simulation of gene loss with uncorrected parameters , then computed the ratio of underestimation by parallel gene losses ( table 2 ) .",
    "the results showed that , as in the case of the last nodes , the ratio of gene pairs that will be underestimated by parallel gene losses could be roughly approximated by @xmath62 .",
    "note that the approximation may depend on the number of species examined or the phylogenetic relationship .",
    "when other data sets are used , the method of parameter correction may have to be modified . in the present study ,",
    "the ratio of underestimation at the deepest node ( @xmath36 ) was different by 5% from @xmath63 , probably because the original data were sparse around this node ( figure 3a ) . letting the ratio of underestimation of gene pairs at @xmath36 be @xmath64 ,",
    "the formula @xmath65 is apparently established , where @xmath66 is the ratio of underestimation focusing on only two distantly related species ( e.g. , zebrafish and medaka ) . therefore , @xmath64 was approximated by @xmath67 in this study . finally , for the period @xmath35 , the losses of gene pairs until the next two nodes ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 , ) were taken into account , and the proportion of gene pairs to be unobservable in the original data was approximated by@xmath70 the value of @xmath71 was about 0.031 with the uncorrected parameters , close to the simulated estimate ( table 2 ) .",
    "thus , the following equations were obtained:@xmath72 according to these equations , the four parameters were fitted again by the newton - raphson method with initial values of @xmath37 = 6892 , @xmath0 = 0.044 , @xmath1 = 0.0076 , and @xmath2 = 0.00078 . as a result , @xmath37 was estimated to be 7143 , and @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 were corrected to 0.036 , 0.0062 , and 0.00095 , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 increased or decreased by about 20% , and the total number of gene pairs was 251 pairs more than the original number .",
    "the plots of @xmath13 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 with the corrected parameters are shown in figure 3 .",
    "little difference was observed in the shape of the @xmath13 curves obtained with the corrected and uncorrected parameters .",
    "the number of lost gene pairs to be counted was corrected to 1476 ( figure 3b ) , but the number observable in the extant genomes was estimated to be 1209 according to the above equation , which was close to the number in the original data .",
    "[ c]lll + @xmath6 ) & ratio of underestimation ( @xmath33sd ) & @xmath75 + @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 + @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 + @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 + @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 + @xmath88 & @xmath89 & @xmath84 + @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 + @xmath93 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 + @xmath96 & @xmath97 & @xmath98 +   + time of ts - wgd & ratio of underestimation ( @xmath33sd ) & @xmath99 + @xmath100 & @xmath101 & @xmath102 +   +   +    in this equilibrium model , the value of @xmath74 converges to 1 at @xmath15 ( @xmath103 ) , indicating that , theoretically , all the genes will be lost in the long - term future .",
    "such a prediction seems to be unnatural from the view of genome evolution .",
    "however , it should be noted that the start number of gene pairs was fixed in the modeling ( @xmath37 = 7143 , or originally 6892 ) , and the gene gain event was not taken into account .",
    "it is possible that the number of genes gained after wgd may compensate for the number lost .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath2 is very small , therefore it will take about 700 million years from the present for the number of genes to decrease by half ( @xmath104 = 3571.5 ) according to the model .",
    "this is a long enough time for the gene content to be influenced by many other evolutionary mechanisms ; thus , ultra - long - term predictions ( about 1000 million years after wgd ) by the equilibrium model are not practical .",
    "rather , the equilibrium model estimates the evolutionary features of duplicate genes in the present or before .",
    "here , i focused on @xmath105 , the probability that a pair of genes derived from wgd differentiated functionally at time @xmath6 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath106 to the probability that a gene pair remains at the present , that is @xmath107 , was almost 1 , implying that almost all the gene pairs present in the extant teleosts have already differentiated functionally .",
    "this conjecture is consistent with the result from a recent gene expression analysis study @xcite , but that is based on a limited number of gene pairs examined only in zebrafish .",
    "further researches using many genes and/or many teleost genomes will need to be carried out to test the equilibrium model .",
    "the advantage of equilibrium model is that the impact of wgd can be quantitatively assessed using the model parameters . for example , the value of @xmath1 , which is the rate of functional differentiation in a gene pair , may be correlated with the occurrence of novel genotypes triggered by wgd .",
    "many detailed models about the mechanisms of functional differentiation have been proposed ( reviewed in @xcite ) , and @xmath1 may be regarded as an averaged index of the effects of these mechanisms at the genomic level .",
    "in addition , @xmath108 indicates the ideal proportion of functionally differentiated gene pairs out of all gene pairs when @xmath109 and @xmath16 .",
    "practically , @xmath106 ( @xmath103 ) better reflects the proportion,@xmath110 and the maximum is obtained using the derivative @xmath111 . for the teleost data used in the present study , the maximum of @xmath112 was about 0.13 with @xmath113 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "thus , assuming that the total gene number for standard teleost species is 2000025000 @xcite , a maximum of 26003300 gene pairs were estimated to have differentiated functionally during 90 million years after ts - wgd . in the case of plant species ,",
    "it was reported that 99% of about 2000 duplicate gene pairs that were examined in the cotton genome had differentiated at the gene expression level during 60 million years after wgd , and probably those have evolved under purifying selection @xcite .",
    "therefore , the estimate of functionally differentiated gene pairs in teleost species might not be very surprising .",
    "it should be stressed that if the equilibrium model is valid not only for teleosts but also for other lineages that have undergone wgds , the above - mentioned indices could be compared among such lineages . from a nave perspective , the value of @xmath1 or @xmath108 ( or @xmath106 ) may be directly or indirectly associated with evolutionarily significant events in the lineages examined , such as the occurrence of novel phenotypes , or other evolutionary features such as the diversity of species or population size . regarding the teleosts",
    ", it is known that one more wgd occurred recently ( @xmath114100 million years ago ) in the lineage of salmonids after the ts - wgd ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , further comparisons using salmonid genomic data may allow the impact of wgd to be assessed and compared within the teleost lineage .",
