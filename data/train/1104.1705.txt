    "historically the casimir force was discovered@xcite as a universal attraction between two parallel electrically neutral ideal metal plates in vacuum separated with a gap of width @xmath0 .",
    "this force per unit area of the plates ( i.e. , the pressure ) is given by @xmath1 i.e. , it depends only on the planck constant @xmath2 , velocity of light @xmath3 and does not depend on the electric charge or any other interaction constants .",
    "according to quantum field theory the energy of the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state in free space is infinitely large and all physical energies are measured from the energy of vacuum .",
    "if two ideal metal planes are placed in free space , the tangential component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic induction must vanish on the planes . as a result ,",
    "not all zero - point oscillations , whose energies taken together create the infinite vacuum energy , are allowed . in spite of the fact that the energy of allowed oscillations is still equal to infinity , after subtraction of the vacuum energy in free space ,",

    "the expressions ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) are of somewhat academic character because they are derived using the idealization of ideal metal planes .",

    "a breakthrough was achieved by lifshitz@xcite who generalized the casimir force for the case of two thick plates made of real materials decribed by the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities @xmath6 and developed the unified theory of the van der waals and casimir force . according to the lifshitz theory , the free energy ( per unit area ) of the dispersion interaction of two material semispaces separated with a gap of width @xmath0 at temperature @xmath7 in thermal equilibrium",

    "it was shown@xcite that the quantity obtained from ( [ eqn6b ] ) in this way does not coincide with the energy , as it is defined in thermodynamics .",
    "most of theoretical and experimental work in the casimir effect was done for metallic test bodies.@xcite@xmath5@xcite it was experimentally demonstrated@xcite@xmath5@xcite that at separations below a micrometer the casimir force is strongly influenced by conduction electrons ( the effect of skin depth ) and by the surface roughness . by and large metallic bodies",

    "actually , a test body coated with a metal film of a few tens of nanometers thickness acts like it is made of a thick metal .",
    "experiments on measuring the gradient of the casimir force between an au coated sphere and an au coated plate@xcite@xmath5@xcite ( using the proximity force approximation , this quantity can be recalculated as the casimir pressure between two parallel plates ) led to important conclusions on the nature of interaction between thermal electromagnetic fluctuations and metals .",
    "specifically , it was demonstrated that the experimental data exclude theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory at a 99.9% confidence level if relaxation properties of conduction electrons are taken into account . on the theoretical side",
    ", it was shown@xcite that inclusion of relaxation properties of conduction electrons into the lifshitz theory results in a violation of the nernst heat theorem . from this",
    "it was concluded@xcite that there may be some deep differences in the response of a physical system to real and fluctuating electromagnetic fields .",
    "although metals are most convenient for high precision experiments on the casimir force , measurements of dispersion forces using semiconductor test bodies open new opportunities for both fundamental physics and numerous applications .",
    "it is common knowledge that semiconductors are the most important materials used in nanotechnology , and their conductivity properties range from metallic to dielectric .",
    "an aim of considerable scientific and technological promise is to control the magnitude of the casimir force varying it from large to small , and , if possible , even changing attraction for repulsion and vice versa .",
    "the use of semiconductor test bodies suggests several ways on how to achieve this aim .",
    "the reflectivity of a semiconductor surface can be changed over a wide frequency range by changing the density of charge carriers .",
    "the latter can be done in a number of ways , for instance , through variation of the temperature , using different kinds of doping , or via illumination of the semiconductor surface with laser light .",
    "this makes it possible to examine the influence of semiconductor material properties on the casimir force and use the obtained results to modulate the magnitude and separation dependence of the force .",
    "we note that in comparison to dielectrics , semiconductors with a reasonably high density of charge carriers have the same advantage as metals , i.e. , they do not have problems such as accumulation of charges and screening effects .",
    "an attempt to measure dispersion forces on a semiconductor surface and to modify them by light was undertaken long ago@xcite in the configuration of a glass lens and a si plate and between a glass lens coated with amorphous si and a si plate .",
    "however , no force change was found on illumination at separations below 350 nm , where it should be most pronounced .",
    "this might be explained by the fact that the use of glass ( and also high resistivity si ) leads to uncontrolled electric forces .",
    "the influence of laser light on the casimir force between two si plates and between an au sphere and a si plate was investigated theoretically.@xcite    the modern stage in the investigation of dispersion forces using semiconductor surfaces started in 2005 when the casimir attraction between a b - doped si plate and a metal coated sphere was measured@xcite using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) . at this stage ,",
    "most of experiments were performed in the configuration of an au - coated sphere ( or a spherical lens ) above a semiconductor plate drawing on experience accumulated in previous measurements of the casimir force between metallic test bodies . the present review collects and discusses all main results on the casimir force obtained using semiconductor surfaces .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the casimir force between a spherical surface and a plate made of different semiconductors .",
    "we begin with the experiment which revealed@xcite that the measured casimir force for a plate made of @xmath34-type si is markedly different from the calculation results for high - resistivity dielectric si . in this experiment",
    "it was demonstrated that the density of charge carriers in a semiconductor material influences the casimir force between metallic and semiconductor test bodies .",
    "then we discuss the experiment where the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and two @xmath35-type si plates with different densities of charge carriers was successively measured.@xcite through this , the difference in the casimir forces for different si plates was calculated , and , thus , more clear evidence for the effect of the charge carrier density on the casimir force was provided .",
    "we next consider the experiment on measuring the casimir force between a metal coated sphere and an indium tin oxide ( ito ) plate.@xcite in this experiment , the reduction of the casimir force by up to a factor of two , when compared with the case of two test bodies made of good metal , was reported . in the end of the section we describe the experiment@xcite on measuring the casimir force between a ge spherical lens with the curvature radius 15.1 cm and ge plate .",
    "the measurement data of this experiment were found consistent@xcite with five different theoretical approaches to the thermal casimir force . in this connection",
    "we indicate a possible source of noncontrolled systematic errors inherent to all measurements of the casimir force using lenses of centimeter - size curvature radii .    in section 3 the experiment on the optical modulation@xcite of the casimir force is considered . here",
    ", the difference in the casimir forces between an au - coated sphere and a si plate in the presence and in the absence of laser light on the plate is measured . the frequency and power of the laser pulses",
    "are selected in such a way that the charge carrier density in si during the bright phase is almost 5 orders of magnitude higher than in the dark phase . in so doing , si in the bright phase was a metal - type semiconductor ( conductivity of such a material goes to a nonzero limit with vanishing temperature ) . in the dark phase si was a semiconductor of dielectric - type with vanishing conductivity in the limit of zero temperature .",
    "the comparison between the measured difference casimir force and the lifshitz theory has led to an unexpected conclusion .",
    "it was demonstrated that the lifshitz theory with inclusion of dc conductivity of si in the dark phase is excluded by the data at a 95% confidence level . at the same time",
    "the measurement data were found consistent with the lifshitz theory if the dc conductivity of si in the dark phase is omitted . keeping in mind that dc conductivity is connected with the relaxation properties of free charge carriers , one can conclude that for dielectric - type semiconductors the optical modulation experiment plays the same role as the experiments@xcite@xmath5@xcite mentioned above for metals . in both cases the experimental data",
    "are inconsistent with the lifshitz theory taking into account relaxation properties of free charge carriers . from the theoretical side it was proved@xcite@xmath5@xcite that the inclusion of the dc conductivity in the model of the dielectric response for dielectrics and dielectric - type semiconductors results in contradiction between the lifshitz theory and the nernst heat theorem",
    "this is also somewhat analogous with the respective situation for metals . in sec .  3 we also discuss recent attempts@xcite@xmath5@xcite to modify the lifshitz theory and show that they are excluded@xcite@xmath5@xcite by the results of the optical modulation experiment at a 70% confidence level .",
    "thus , the optical modulation experiment , which demonstrated the possibility to periodically change the casimir force with light , is important not only for applications , but for fundamental physics as well .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the investigation of the changes of the casimir force in phase transitions .",
    "experiments on this subject involve an au - coated sphere and a plate made of a phase change material . in the previous experiment@xcite an amorphous sample of aginsbte",
    "was used as the plate . under annealing the plate material",
    "was switched from the amorphous to crystalline phase . in the proposed experiment@xcite the vo@xmath36 film deposited on a sapphire plate undergoes dielectric - to - metal phase transition with an increase in temperature .    in sec .",
    "5 we discuss measurements of the gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a si surface covered with rectangular corrugations.@xcite these measurements allow to observe effects that include the role of geometry and the optical properties of a semiconductor material .",
    "the possibility to obtain a pulsating casimir force in a three layer system , where at least one layer is made of a semiconductor , is considered in sec .",
    "a pulsation , i.e. , periodic change of attraction with repulsion and vice versa , can be achieved@xcite through the illumination of a semiconductor layer with laser pulses .    in sec .",
    "7 the reader will find our conclusions and discussion .",
    "the presentation below is based on original publications . in several cases ,",
    "however , we make a more exact analysis of the experimental data and their comparison with theory .",
    "these cases are indicated in the text .",

    "here , we discuss the results of four experiments , where a semiconductor plate interacts via the casimir force with an au - coated sphere or a ge spherical lens . in these experiments , different semiconductors are used . in all cases",
    "it was confirmed that the replacement of the metallic plate with a semiconductor one markedly diminishes the magnitude of the casimir force . however , as is shown below , different experiments , depending on their precision , contain different information with respect to theoretical models consistent with the experimental data .      in this experimen,@xcite",
    "the casimir force was measured between an au - coated sphere of diameter @xmath37 m and a single - crystal si plate doped with b. the @xmath34-type si plate had an area @xmath38 and a thickness of @xmath39 m .",

    "this is a metal - type semiconductor whose conductivity does not go to zero when the temperature vanishes . for typical metals ,",
    "however , resistivities are two or three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "the same experimental setup@xcite@xmath5@xcite as for two metallic test bodies ( with much higher vacuum of @xmath42torr ) was used to measure the casimir force .",

    "this flexing is detected by the deflection of the laser beam leading to a difference signal between the photodiodes a and b. the difference signal is calibrated by means of an electrostatic force .",
    "here we only discuss the obtained experimental results and their comparison with theory and do not consider details of the setup and calibration procedures which are fully described in the original publications@xcite and in refs .  .",
    "the casimir force between the sphere and the plate was measured as a function of separation . in so doing ,",
    "the sphere was kept grounded while a compensating voltage was applied to the plate to cancel the residual potential difference @xmath43v ( the latter was found to be independent of separation ) .",
    "the separation was varied continuously from about @xmath44 m to small distances by applying continuous triangular voltages at 0.02hz to the piezoelectric actuator .",
    "however , the measurement data becomes meaningful only below 350 nm ( at @xmath45 nm the total experimental error is approximately equal to the force magnitude ) .",
    "the force data were collected at equidistant points @xmath46 nm separated by 0.17 nm .",

    "this was justified by the smallness of thermal effects at short separations . keeping in mind increased attention to the problem of thermal casimir force during the last few years , here we recalculate theoretical results using the lifshitz formula ( [ eqn3 ] ) at @xmath51 . according to the pfa,@xcite the casimir force between a sphere and a plate is given by @xmath52 where the free energy @xmath53 is given in eq .",

    "one more demonstration that the magnitude of the casimir force depends on the dielectric properties of metallic - type semiconductors has been performed@xcite in the configuration of an au - coated sphere and an ito plate ( in@xmath36o@xmath115:sn )",
    ". advantages of using ito in the casimir physics were proposed in ref .  .",
    "the experimental setup used an afm schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] with a sphere of @xmath116 m radius .",
    "main differences from experiments described above are that the measurements were performed in an ambient environment in the dynamic mode .",
    "this means that the afm cantilever with the sphere attached to it was considered as a harmonic oscillator with a natural resonant frequency @xmath117rad / s . under the influence of the casimir force",
    "@xmath118 the value of the resonant frequency was changed to some @xmath119 . in the linear regime",
    "we get@xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 is the mass of the oscillator .",
    "earlier the frequency shift @xmath124 from the dynamic scheme was measured directly using the frequency modulation technique in experiments on the determination of the casimir pressure between two metallic surfaces by means of a micromechanical torsional oscillator.@xcite@xmath5@xcite note that the pfa allows recalculation of the gradient of the casimir force between a sphere and a plate into the casimir pressure between the two parallel plates according to@xcite @xmath125 in the experiment@xcite the frequency modulation technique was not used . instead , the oscillation amplitude at a fixed frequency was monitored",
    ". then the resonant frequency shift due to the casimir force led to a change in amplitude which can be related to the force gradient ( similar dynamic scheme was used in the measurements@xcite of the gradient of the casimir force between metallic surfaces by means of an afm , but the phase of the oscillator was monitored instead of the amplitude ) .",
    "however , it is necessary to be cautious with both amplitude and phase detection methods .",
    "the problem is that oscillator amplitude and phase can change not only because of frequency shift , but also because of change in dissipation ( oscillator energy loss ) .",
    "dissipation is of particular concern if the experiments are done in air as the air layer thickness between plate and sphere keeps changing when the plate is moved closer to the sphere .",
    "another feature of this experiment is that it consisted of the two measurements . in the first measurement",
    "the force between an au coated sphere and an au - coated sapphire plate was measured . in the second measurement this plate",
    "was replaced with a glass substrate coated with an ito film of thickness of 190 nm , resistivity @xmath126 cm and charge carrier density @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the measure of reduction in the force magnitudes due to the replacement of au with the semiconductor can be found with no comparison to the theoretical results .",
    "the relative random error of the total force gradient measurements ( electric plus casimir ) at a separation 95 nm was estimated@xcite as about 3.5% of force gradient . keeping in mind that the random errors in both total and electric forces are distributed normally , the relative random error in the measurements of the casimir force can not be smaller than 3.5% .",
    "in addition , the measured casimir force gradients were affected@xcite by a 3% systematic error .",
    "the absolute random error of 0.5 nm in the determination of initial separation ( chosen at about @xmath128 m ) was reported.@xcite during the 580 measurement runs , the mechanical drift of initial separation for 52 nm was observed . the absolute systematic error in the initial separation was of about@xcite 1.4 nm . from the comparison of the measured gradient of the casimir force in au - au and au - ito configurations it was concluded that the replacement of an au plate with an ito plate leads to roughly 40%50% smaller casimir pressure between two parallel plates at separations from 80 to 120 nm .",
    "note that in an ambient environment used in these measurements the residual potential difference @xmath100 between the sphere and the plate varied with time significantly in the au - ito configuration ( from 72 to 50mv at the separation of 100 nm ) .",
    "the comparison of the experimental data with theory was performed using the lifshitz formula ( [ eqn6b ] ) at zero temperature and eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) with energy instead of the free energy , although measurements were performed at @xmath129k . in this comparison",
    "the contribution of the surface roughness to the gradient of the casimir force was disregarded .",
    "in fact an au - coating on the polystyrene sphere was characterized@xcite by stochastic roughness with the variance @xmath130 nm .",
    "for the au and ito coatings on the plates @xmath131 and 4 nm , respectively . note that surface roughness increases the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "if corrections due to surface roughness were included in computations of the casimir force , this would lead to about 2% correction in the case of au - au surfaces and 4% correction for au - ito surfaces at the separation @xmath132 nm . the dielectric permittivity of au along the imaginary frequency axis was described by the tabulated optical data@xcite for @xmath62 ( see sec .",
    "2.1 ) extrapolated to low frequencies by the imaginary part of the drude function ( [ eqn10 ] ) .",
    "for the dielectric permittivity of ito eq .",
    "( [ eqn12 ] ) was used where the representation for @xmath84 was taken from ref .  .",
    "as a result , different powers of separations for data and theory were obtained.@xcite this can be explained by the use of the lifshitz theory at zero temperature for the comparison with the room - temperature measurement data ( for au test bodies this approach was experimentally excluded@xcite at a 70% confidence level ) .",
    "further refinement of the dielectric properties of ito is also needed to bring the experimental data in agreement with theory .    to conclude ,",
    "this measurement is another confirmation that using different semiconductor materials one can control the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "all the experiments using semiconductor test bodies , which were discussed in secs .",
    "2.12.3 , have been performed with the help of an afm and spheres of about @xmath133 m radius .",
    "in fact the cantilever of an afm with attached sphere can be considered as a micromechanical device having a very high force sensitivity .",
    "this made the use of an afm in measurements of the casimir force , suggested for the first time for two metallic test bodies in ref .",
    ", very productive .",
    "an alternative approach to measuring the casimir force by using a torsion pendulum and a spherical lens of more that 10 cm curvature radius was suggested for two metallic test bodies in ref .  .",

    "below it is shown , however , that the use of large lenses leads to serious problems regarding the reproducibility of measurement results and the comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "now we consider the measurement of the casimir force between a crystalline intrinsic ge plate and a crystalline intrinsic ge lens of curvature radius @xmath135 cm performed@xcite by means of a torsion pendulum .",
    "the ge lens was mounted on a piezoelectric @xmath136 motion stage and the ge plate on one arm of the torsion pendulum with a body of 15 cm length in vacuum of @xmath137torr .",
    "a pendulum body was suspended by a tungsten wire of length 2.5 cm and diameter @xmath138 m .",
    "the other arm of the pendulum played the role of the center electrode situated in between two fixed compensator plates forming two parallel plate capacitors @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the casimir force between a ge lens and ge plate resulted in a torque which rotated the pendulum body .",
    "this resulted in changes in the capacitances @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which were detected with a phase sensitive circuit .",
    "then , compensating voltages were applied to the capacitances through a feedback circuit to counteract the change in the angle of the torsion pendulum and to keep the system in equilibrium .",
    "these compensating voltages were a measure of the casimir force .",
    "the calibration of the setup was performed by means of the measurements of electric forces .",
    "it was found , however , that the residual potential difference @xmath100 depends on separation where it was measured . according to ref .  , this might be explained by the polishing stresses or the curvature of the lens surface changing the crystal plane orientation at the surface .",
    "in addition , it was suggested that there was the contribution to electric force due to random short - scale patches . as a result , even after the application of the compensating potential , there was a residual electrostatic force of a complicated nature .",
    "an expression for this force containing three fitting parameters was obtained at large separations , where the casimir force was assumed to be negligibly small .",
    "the values of the fitting parameters were determined from the fit to the experimental data of electric force measurements at large separations .",
    "then , the obtained expression for the electric force was extrapolated to lower separation distances and subtracted from the experimental data for the total measured force at all separations in order to get the measured data for the casimir force alone .",
    "this procedure seems to be not enough justified because , even if the found phenomenological expression for the electric force is applicable at large separations , it might incorrectly describe the residual electric force at short separations .",
    "the obtained experimental casimir forces were compared with five theoretical approaches . within the first approach intrinsic ge was considered as a high - resistivity dielectric described by the dielectric permittivity of core electrons @xmath141 . in the second approach ,",
    "the free charge carriers ( electrons and holes ) were taken into account by means of the drude model using eq .",

    "the confidence level is not reported . however , these estimates of ref .",
    "do not correspond and match to those reported in rest of the paper .",

    "thus , the correct relative errors of the casimir force at 1 , 2 , and @xmath148 m are no less than 40% , 124% , and 211% , respectively .",

    "the experimental results were compared with the theoretically computed using the lifshitz theory . for this purpose",
    "the imaginary parts of the dielectric functions for the crystalline and amorphous films of the aginsbte were measured with ellipsometry as a function of frequency in the frequency range from 0.04 to 8.9ev .",

    "it was noted that the small roughness of the used samples `` is negligible for the casimir - force computations at separations above 70 nm [ ] '' . as a result",
    "it was found that the lifshitz theory based on the measured optical properties predicts a force smaller that the measured one by 818% . after discussing several reasons which might be responsible for this deviation , which is larger than the experimental and theoretical errors , it was stated somewhat contradictorily that `` the observed deviation between theory and experiment can be attributed to surface roughness as discussed recently in ref .",

    "the combination of a dynamic measurement scheme with the advantages of a difference force measurement can bring much more exact experimental data which should be compared with different theoretical approaches proposed in the literature taking into account nonzero temperature , surface roughness and all other relevant factors .",

    "although in the literature it is common to speak about dielectric ( insulator ) to metal transition , this is in fact a transition between two semiconductor plates with lower ( @xmath35 ) and higher ( @xmath303 ) charge carrier densities .",
    "as was shown above , an increase of @xmath35 by a factor of @xmath302 leads to measurable changes in the casimir force .",
    "thus , the phase transition from dielectric to metal phase can be used to control the casimir force in a sphere - plate geometry by mere temperature change .",
    "it was proposed@xcite to measure the change of the casimir force acting between an au - coated sphere and a vanadium dioxide ( vo@xmath36 ) film deposited on a sapphire substrate .",

    "note that at such separations the relativistic retardation effects are already important .",
    "the casimir repulsion between an au sphere and a sio@xmath36 plate with an intermediate layer of bromobenzene was observed@xcite at separations of about 30 nm .",

    "the second pair consists of two similar si plates , and only one of them is illuminated with laser pulses . according to sec .  3",

    "[ aba : fig21 ] we show all related dielectric permittivities along the imaginary frequency axis . the dielectric permittivities of si in the absence and in the presence of light are indicated by the solid lines 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the line 2 is plotted for the absorbed power @xmath388mw ( see sec .",

    "[ aba : fig22](a ) , for separations larger than 156 nm the casimir pressure shown by the black solid line is repulsive .",
    "this reflects the fact that in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig21 ] the dielectric permittivity of ethanol is sandwiched between the dielectric permittivities of si and au in a wide frequency range , i.e. , inequalities ( [ eqn41 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the pressure - distance dependence in the presence of laser light on a si plate is shown by the grey solid line in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig22](a ) .",
    "this line corresponds to attraction at all separation distances .",
    "physical explanation of this fact is seen in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig21 ] , where the dielectric permittivity of si in the presence of light ( the solid line 2 ) is larger than the dielectric permittivity of ethanol ( the short - dashed line ) within a wide frequency region .",
    "thus , the illumination of a si plate with laser light violates inequalities ( [ eqn41 ] ) and changes repulsion for attraction .    for the second pair of plates ,",
    "i.e. , for the two si plates separated by ethanol , the casimir force in the absence of laser light is attractive at all separations [ see the dashed black line in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig22](a ) ] .",
    "this result is expected because the permittivities of both plates are equal .",
    "when , however , one si plate is illuminated with a laser light of appropriate wavelength and power , its dielectric permittivity is described by the solid line labeled 2 in in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig21 ] , and the inequalities ( [ eqn41 ] ) are satisfied . in this case , the computational results for the casimir pressure versus separation are shown by the dashed grey line in fig .  [ aba : fig22](a ) .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , at @xmath389 nm the casimir force is attractive , but at @xmath390 nm it is repulsive .",
    "thus , the illumination of one of the two si plates separated by ethanole with light changes the casimir attraction to casimir repulsion .    for the first and second pairs of plates , the magnitudes of the repulsive forces were several times less than the magnitudes of the attractive forces .",
    "this is not the case for the third pair of plates , i.e. , for the three - layer system @xmath383-al@xmath36o@xmath115ethanol  si . in the absence of laser light the inequalities ( [ eqn41 ] ) are not satisfied ( see fig .",
    "[ aba : fig21 ] ) .",
    "the computational results for the casimir pressure in this case are shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig22](b ) by the black line .",
    "it is seen that the casimir force is attractive as expected .",
    "now let the si plate be illuminated with the laser light .",
    "then the dielectric permittivity of si is described by the solid line labeled 2 in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig21 ] , and the inequalities ( [ eqn41 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the respective computational results for the casimir pressure versus separation are shown by the solid grey line in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig22](b ) .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , at separations @xmath391 nm the corresponding casimir force is repulsive . in this case , the casimir repulsion and attraction are of the same order of magnitude within a wide range of separations .",
    "thus , the third pair of plates provides an example where the illumination of the si plate changes the casimir attraction to the casimir repulsion of the same order of magnitude .    the possibility to observe the pulsating casimir force was discussed@xcite for the two plates completely immersed in the liquid far away from any air - liquid interface in order to prevent the occurrence of capillary forces .",
    "it is expected that special procedures for surface preparation of the plates will be necessary to bring about intimate contact between the plates and liquid .",
    "then the only liquid - based force is the drag force due to the movement of the plates in response to the change of the casimir force .",
    "it can be seen , however , that the drag force is negligibly small .",
    "thus , for the casimir pressure values of around 10mpa and typical spring constants of @xmath392 , the corresponding drag pressure from plate movement would be six orders of magnitude less in value .",
    "the proposed effect of the pulsating casimir force can be used to actuate the periodic movement of electrodes and mirrors in electro- and optomechanical devices .",
    "this can be achieved by using the standard frequency generators and modulators to select the appropriate duration and time between the laser pulses .",
    "in fact the effect of a pulsating casimir force is the combination of the familiar properties of three - layer systems@xcite and the recently discovered@xcite modulation of the casimir force with light .",
    "the possibility of pulsation owing to vacuum fluctuations alone without use of mechanical springs to a large measure depends on the use of the repulsive casimir force .",
    "according to the introductory part of this section , three - layer systems are presently the single configuration where the casimir repulsion is realized experimentally . in this respect",
    "it is pertinent to mention that the repulsive casimir force was recently predicted@xcite in the configuration of two parallel plates separated by an empty gap , one of which is made of a ferromagnetic dielectric and another of a metal described by the plasma model . by now the influence of magnetic properties of plate materials onto the casimir force in not confirmed experimentally . keeping in mind that magnetic films are widely used in different microelectromechanical devices , such a confirmation would have an important impact on nanotechnology .",
    "in the foregoing we have considered all experiments performed up to date and a few proposals where the magnitude of the casimir force was controlled using semiconductor test bodies .",
    "it is common knowledge that casimir@xcite discovered his famous effect for ideal metal planes and the most of modern experiments on measuring the casimir force were performed with metallic test bodies.@xcite however , applications of the casimir effect in nanotechnology , which is heavily based on the use of semiconductor materials , demand extensive study of the casimir force in configurations with semiconductor surfaces .",
    "this opens considerable opportunities to change the magnitude of the casimir force in a desirable way and to use this force for operation of microdevices .",
    "the first steps in this direction were made by the many performed experiments discussed in this review .    in sec .",
    "2 we considered the results of two pioneer experiments@xcite@xmath5@xcite on measuring the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and semiconductor plates with different densities of charge carriers . already",
    "the first experiment of this kind@xcite using a plate made of @xmath34-type si demonstrated that the casimir force was markedly different from the calculated forces both in the case of two metallic test bodies and an au - coated sphere interacting with high - resistivity dielectric si . in the second experiment,@xcite",
    "the casimir forces between an au - coated sphere and two plates made of @xmath35-type si with different charge carrier densities were directly measured in succession . in this way it was convincingly shown that the casimir force depends on the density of charge carriers and",
    "this can be used to control its magnitude . in both experiments",
    "it was confirmed that the replacement of an au plate with a si plate leads to decrease in the magnitude of the casimir force from about 25% to 35% depending on the value of separation in comparison with the case of two au test bodies .",
    "later it was shown@xcite that the use of other semiconductor materials can result in even larger decrease in the magnitude of the casimir pressure .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the casimir pressure between an au plate and an ito plate was found@xcite to vary by from 40% to 50% smaller than for two au plates .",
    "we have also discussed the experiment@xcite on measuring the casimir force between a ge plate and a ge spherical lens with about 15 cm curvature radius . with respect to this experiment several disadvantages were remarked which make the obtained results for the casimir force indefinite . specifically , the subtracted asymptotic expression for the electric force might be not applicable at short separations , and the comparison with theory was based on the version of pfa which does not take into account surface imperfections which are always present on lenses of centimeter - size radii .    the most important experiment with semiconductor surfaces performed up to date",
    "is an experiment on the optical modulation of the casimir force considered in sec .",
    "this was the measurement of the difference casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a @xmath34-type si plate illuminated with laser pulses.@xcite according to the measurement scheme employed not the individual forces , but only the difference of the forces in the presence and in the absence of light on a si plate has been measured . here ,",
    "similar to the experiments considered in sec .  2 ,",
    "the casimir force in the absence of light on a si plate was of about 35%40% smaller in magnitude than for two au test bodies .",
    "however , in the presence of light on a si plate the force magnitude increased by about 4%6% depending on separation . the increase and then the decrease of the force",
    "were repeated periodically in line with the laser pulses .",
    "this opens new prospective opportunities for the use of the casimir force in the operation of micromachines .",
    "the comparison of the measurement data of the experiment on optically modulated casimir force with the lifshitz theory resulted in an unexpected conclusion@xcite that if the dc conductivity of a si plate in the absence of laser light is taken into account in the model of dielectric response the theory is excluded by the data at a 95% confidence level .",
    "if the dc conductivity of si in the dark phase is omitted , the lifshitz theory is found to be consistent with the data within both 95% and more narrow 70% confidence intervals . keeping in mind that the dc conductivity is a real physical effect and that the lifshitz theory is a fundamental theory based on first principles of quantum statistical physics and quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "the obtained conclusion should be considered as challenging .",
    "the hypothesis@xcite that some concepts of statistical physics concerning interaction of real and fluctuating electromagnetic fields might need a reconsideration has raised a heated debate.@xcite however , the experimental data of one more experiment@xcite led to the same conclusion that the lifshitz theory is in disagreement with the data when the dc conductivity of a dielectric plate is taken into account.@xcite the attempts@xcite@xmath5@xcite to modify the lifshitz theory were also found to be in disagreement with the data of the experiment on the optically modulated casimir force .",
    "thus , this experiment takes on great significance as a test for fundamental physical theories .    in sec .",
    "4 we have discussed changes in the casimir force which occur when the material of the plate undergoes a phase transition . both already performed@xcite and proposed@xcite",
    "experiments were considered . specifically , it was observed@xcite that the gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a crystalline plate is greater by approximately 20% than for an amorphous plate made of the same semiconductor material ( aginsbte ) . in spite of rather large deviations between the experimental data and",
    "theory in this experiment , the conclusion was made that phase transitions in semiconductor materials are very promising for the control of the casimir force .",
    "another possibility to control the casimir force discussed in sec .",
    "5 is connected with the use of corrugated semiconductor surfaces .",
    "we have discussed the two experiments@xcite on the measurement of the casimir force gradient between an au - coated sphere and si plates covered with rectangular corrugations of different profiles .",
    "these experiments demonstrated that there is a nontrivial interplay between material properties and geometrical profiles of semiconductor surfaces which can not be taken into account with sufficient precision by using the pfa . although the comparison of experiment and theory in refs .   was shown to be not complete ( specifically , theory at zero temperature",
    "was used for the interpretation of the room - temperature measurement data ) the obtained results show that geometrical shape of interacting semiconductor surfaces is a promising tool for the control of the casimir force in addition to material properties .",
    "a more sophisticated possibility for control of the casimir force than all those listed above was considered in sec .",
    "while in all the above experiments and proposals only the attractive casimir force was exploited , here the attraction is replaced with repulsion and vice versa .",
    "such a pulsating casimir force@xcite using no mechanical springs can be realized by a combination of the optical modulation experiment with the advantages of three - layer systems . as at least one of the layers , a semiconductor material which changes its charge carrier density by about five orders of magnitude under the influence of a laser pulse can be used .",
    "the investigation of possibilities to control the casimir force using semiconductor test bodies is presently in the very beginning and much should be done before some of them will find application in industrially produced devices . in future",
    "the influence of many different semiconductor materials with different kind of doping on the casimir force should be explored .",
    "it will be of much interest to repeat the experiment on the optical modulation of the casimir force with plates made of different semiconductors and in an ambient environment in order to determine the possibility of its application in microelectromechanical devices .",
    "till the moment , the use of phase transitions in semiconductors in casimir physics is in a very initial state .",
    "a great variety of phase transitions and their influence on the casimir force will be investigated in the near future .",
    "last but not the least is the prospect to achieve a deeper understanding of the role of charge carriers in the theory of thermal casimir force .",
    "such an outstanding problem , when it remains unsettled for a long time , may considerably retard further experimental developments .",
