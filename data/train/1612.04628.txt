    "parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry , which is the invariance under simultaneous parity and time reversal transformation , plays an important role in non - hermitian ( nh ) quantum mechanics and optics @xcite , with potential applications in optical beam engineering , mode conversion , image processing , laser mode selection , asymmetric transmission , and other fields @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry of a hamiltonian is defined as @xmath1 with the parity operator ( @xmath2 ) and time - reversal operator ( @xmath3 ) , where @xmath4 is the position operator , @xmath5 is the momentum operator , and @xmath6 denotes time . as the operators @xmath0 and @xmath7 may share common eigenfunctions , a broad class of non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians can still have entirely real eigenvalue spectra .",
    "however , depending on the values of the gain and loss parameters , the @xmath0-symmetry may be spontaneously broken @xcite , and then the eigenvalues become complex . in the last few years ,",
    "@xmath0-symmetry and @xmath0-symmetry - breaking have been observed in several optical experiments @xcite .",
    "an important issue in a @xmath0-symmetric system is the ability to control and tune the @xmath0 phase transition .",
    "one possibility is obviously to vary the level of gain and loss in the system ; however , this is a rather challenging task , as the gain and loss should remain balanced and thus must be tuned simultaneously . in recent years",
    ", it has been proposed that periodic modulations can be used to control @xmath0-symmetry in two - state systems @xcite .",
    "it has been found that pseudo-@xmath0-symmetry may appear whether or not the original system is @xmath0-symmetric , and spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry - breaking sensitively depends on the modulation parameters @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on the high - frequency floquet method to rescale the coupling strength . therefore , the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric range only can be modulated narrow .",
    "another means of control is to geometrically twist the fiber @xcite , which can introduce additional peierls phases in the coupling constants among the fiber , and thus the transition from unbroken to broken @xmath0-symmetric phases can be conveniently controlled .",
    "although there are several studies on the manipulation of @xmath0-symmetry , how to control the balanced gain and loss is still lacking .    in this paper , we investigate how to control the balanced gain and loss in a @xmath0-symmetric optical coupler by periodically modulating the coupling strength between two waveguides . using the high - frequency floquet method ,",
    "the modulated system is effectively described by an effective averaged system whose gain and loss can be modulated by adjusting the modulation amplitude or frequency .",
    "such an original non - hermitian system can even be modulated into an effective hermitian system .",
    "the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry - breaking transition is analytically derived and is well consistent with the numerical simulation .",
    "it is revealed that the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric range can be modulated to a wider parameter region .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we explore the constructive role of periodic modulation in controlling the gain and loss of a @xmath0-symmetric optical coupler . in section iii , we study the floquet modulation of @xmath0-symmetry and the corresponding dynamics . in section iv , the possibility of experimentally observing our theoretical predictions is discussed . in the last section",
    ", we briefly summarize our results .",
    "we consider a periodically modulated linear @xmath0-symmetric coupler that is described by the following coupled - mode equation : @xmath8c_2+i \\gamma c_1 , \\nonumber \\\\ i\\frac{dc_2}{dz}&= & \\big[\\frac{\\upsilon}{2}+\\frac{f\\cos(\\omega z)}{2}\\big]c_1-i \\gamma c_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the complex amplitudes and @xmath11 is the coordinate in the propagation direction .",
    "parameter @xmath12 is the interchannel coupling strength , @xmath13 is the gain or loss strength , @xmath14 is the modulation amplitude , and @xmath15 is the modulation frequency . obviously , by defining the parity operator as @xmath16 , which interchanges the two channels labeled by 1 and 2 , and the time - reversal operator as @xmath17 : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which reverses the propagation direction , the hamiltonian @xmath20 of system ( [ twomodeequation ] ) is @xmath0 symmetric because @xmath21 . to simplify , below we only consider the case of @xmath22 , as the system is invariant under the transformation @xmath23 and all the parameters are dimensionless throughout this paper",
    ".     for @xmath24 and @xmath25.,width=326 ]    by making use of the linear combinations @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ", we can rewrite eq.([twomodeequation ] ) as @xmath28 under the condition @xmath29 $ ] , one can perform high - frequency floquet analysis . then , by introducing the transformation @xmath30,\\nonumber \\\\ \\psi_{2}&=&\\psi_{2}^{'}\\exp[-i\\frac{f}{2\\omega}\\sin(\\omega z)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and averaging the high - frequency terms , one can obtain the effectively unmodulated system @xmath31 with the rescaled gain and loss parameter @xmath32 here , @xmath33 are ordinary bessel functions . therefore , the modulus of @xmath34 depends on the values of @xmath35 , and can change from @xmath13 to zero at some specific values of @xmath35 ( such as @xmath36 2.4 and 5.52 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath37 , the effective system corresponds to a hermitian system .",
    "surprisingly , in contrast to our conventional understanding , we find that the gain and loss of system can be manipulated by applying a periodic modulation , and even an original non - hermitian system can be modulated into an effective hermitian system . as is well known , the change of the gain and loss parameter is connected to the transition from unbroken to broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "our results imply that the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric range can be modulated wide , which is different from previous results @xcite , where the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric range only can be modulated narrow .",
    "by diagonalizing the hamiltonian for effective model ( [ twomodeequation3 ] ) , two eigenvalues can be easily determined by @xmath38 obviously , dependent on the values of @xmath39 , the two eigenvalues can be real or complex .",
    "the two eigenvalues are real if @xmath40 , and they become complex if @xmath41 . therefore , @xmath42 is the critical point for the phase transition between the real and complex spectra in the effective system , which corresponds to original system ( [ twomodeequation2 ] ) under high - frequency modulation .",
    "the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry - breaking transition takes place in effective model ( [ twomodeequation3 ] ) when the imaginary part @xmath43 changes from zero to nonzero .",
    "note that because @xmath44 can be modulated from @xmath13 to 0 , the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric range can be modulated wide by tuning the amplitude of periodic modulation for a fixed @xmath12 .    to show the parametric dependence of @xmath45 , in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) , we show @xmath46 as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath13 for both a small coupling strength @xmath47 and large coupling strength @xmath48 with @xmath25 .",
    "first , it is clear that , compared with a @xmath0-symmetric system with no modulation , the region of @xmath0 symmetry in our modulated system can obviously be manipulated to be wider by tuning @xmath35 , which is different to previous results @xcite .",
    "second , near a minimum of @xmath44 such as @xmath49 , despite the size of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , there always exists a completely real quasienergy spectrum .     as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath13 for different coupling strengths @xmath47 ( a ) and @xmath48 ( b ) .",
    "the other parameter is fixed as @xmath25 .",
    "the white curves are the boundary ( @xmath50 ) between @xmath51 and @xmath52.,width=326 ]    according to the floquet theorem , one can use a numerical method to calculate the floquet states and their quasienergies for arbitrary modulation amplitude and frequency .",
    "the floquet states of modulated system ( [ twomodeequation ] ) satisfy @xmath53 for @xmath54 , where propagation constant @xmath55 is designated as the quasienergy , and complex amplitudes @xmath56 are periodic with modulation period @xmath57 . the quasienergies and amplitudes of modulated system ( [ twomodeequation ] ) are then given by @xmath58 with the floquet operator @xmath59 to verify the validity of the above high - frequency floquet analysis , we compare the numerical quasienergies obtained from original model ( [ twomodeequation ] ) and analytical formula ( [ eigenequation ] ) obtained from effective model ( [ twomodeequation3 ] ) . as an example , we show the real parts @xmath60 and imaginary parts @xmath61 of quasienergies @xmath55 as a function of @xmath13 for different driving amplitudes @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 in fig .",
    "the other parameters are chosen as @xmath47 and @xmath25 .",
    "obviously , in the high - frequency regime @xmath29 $ ] the analytical ( solid lines ) and numerical ( circles ) values for the quasienergies @xmath55 are in good agreement .",
    "this clearly shows that below the critical point ( @xmath65 ) , both the numerical and analytical results confirm the entirely real quasienergy spectrum , and the transition from a completely real quasienergy spectrum ( @xmath51 ) to a complex spectrum ( @xmath52 ) can take place when @xmath13 increases . in particular , in contrast to a @xmath0-symmetric system without periodic modulation , the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry - breaking transition can be manipulated by tuning the modulation parameter . for small @xmath14 , for example @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , one clearly sees that there exists a narrow real quasienergy spectrum region , and the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry - breaking transition takes place at @xmath66 . for a bigger @xmath14 , such as @xmath67 , the region of the real quasienergy spectrum broadens and",
    "the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry - breaking transition occurs at @xmath68 ( see fig . [ fig3](d ) ) .",
    "the quasienergy spectrum is always completely real regardless of the size of @xmath13 for @xmath69 , which is equivalent to a hermitian case , as shown in fig .",

    ", we also show the quasienergy dependence on modulation parameter @xmath35 for different parameters @xmath12 in fig .",

    "as shown in figures [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) , for a small coupling strength @xmath47 , the @xmath0 symmetry can spontaneously break when parameter @xmath35 changes . if the coupling strength is increased to @xmath48 , a completely real quasienergy spectrum always appears when modulation parameter @xmath35 exceeds a critical value .",
    "these results show that the region of @xmath0 symmetry can be manipulated wider by tuning @xmath35 in the case of bigger coupling strength for a fixed parameter @xmath13 .     and the imaginary parts @xmath61 of the complex quasienergies as a function of @xmath13 for different driving amplitudes @xmath62 ( top row ) , @xmath67 ( middle row ) and @xmath69 ( bottom row ) .",

    "<S> controlling the balanced gain and loss in a @xmath0-symmetric system is a rather challenging task . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing floquet theory , we explore the constructive role of periodic modulation in controlling the gain and loss of a @xmath0-symmetric optical coupler . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the gain and loss of the system can be manipulated by applying a periodic modulation . </S>",
    "<S> further , such an original non - hermitian system can even be modulated into an effective hermitian system derived by the high - frequency floquet method . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , compared with other @xmath0 symmetry control schemes , our protocol can modulate the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric range to a wider parameter region . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a promising approach for controlling the gain and loss of a realistic system .    </S>",
