    "the reflection symmetry plays the crucial role defining the character of phase transition in nonrandom mean  field ( mf ) models.@xcite generally speaking the presence of the terms without reflection symmetry usually results in the first order phase transition , while in the absence of such terms the transition is of the second order . in the case of random mf systems",
    "the absence of reflection symmetry also leads to a special form of the free energy functional that differs from the symmetrical case . as a consequence ,",
    "the scenarios of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) are different for these two cases .",
    "however , not only symmetry determines the transition to nonergodic state . extending the class of models permits considering the role of different factors in the scenarios of appearance of sg - type states . in this paper",
    "we try to use our recent results for different models for spin  glass  like states in complex nonmagnetic systems ( see ref . [ ] for a review ) to investigate how the interaction type correlates with the spin glass ( sg ) behavior .    the theory of spin glasses developed as an attempt to describe unordered equilibrium freezing of spins in actual dilute magnetic systems with disorder and frustration .",
    "this problem was soon solved at the mean - field level edwards and anderson,@xcite sherrington and kirkpatrick,@xcite almeida and thouless,@xcite and parisi  @xcite [ see ref .   for a review ] . the sherrington ",
    "kirkpatrick approach to the spin - glass theory starts from the hamiltonian @xmath0 it describes ising spins @xmath1 located on the lattice sites @xmath2 .",
    "the quenched interactions @xmath3 are distributed with the gaussian probability , @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 s the number of sites . to perform averaging over disorder in this case one has to average the quenched free energy @xmath8 rather than the partition sum @xmath9 itself . such averaging is usually performed using the replica method .",
    "after that the free energy becomes the function of the order parameters that depend on replica indices : @xmath10 the free energy @xmath11 has an extremum for the replica symmetric ( rs ) solution when all @xmath12 are equal .",
    "however this state is unstable under rsb .",
    "parisi proposed the method of rsb step by step with the limit full rsb ( frsb ) when @xmath13 becomes a continuous function of a parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this approach allows to describe the main features of the experiments on spin glasses .",
    "namely , in the framework of the equilibrium approach , the spin glass phase with qualitatively correct boundaries was obtained and the difference in the behavior of magnetic susceptibility in field  cooled and zero  field  cooled cases was explained .",
    "so , the problem of theoretical description of sg _ per se _ was solved in principle and during that time different other models appeared without any connection to real experiments and real physical systems .",
    "the main feature of these models was the absence of time reversal symmetry ",
    "in contrast to the sk model .",
    "the most investigated model among those are the @xmath15-spin models and the potts models , considered , for example , in refs .  .",
    "the spherical @xmath15-spin model [ see , e.g. , ref .  ]",
    "was believed for a long time to be a generic for this class of models . from the point of view of rsb",
    "the main feature of this model is the stability of the first step of rsb ( 1rsb ) down to zero temperature .",
    "also , the order parameter behaves stepwise .",
    "although this model was not aimed to describe any actual glass it appears to be very interesting because its behavior gives a scenario for real liquid - glass transition : two critical temperatures , the number of metastable states similar to that obtained in numerical modeling .",
    "it should be noted that the structure of the dynamical equations for the correlation functions are identical for the supercooled liquids in the mode - coupling theory and for the @xmath15-spin spherical sg model.@xcite    based mainly on the investigations of these two models  sk and @xmath15-spin spherical  a conclusion appears in the literature attributing the two classes of universality to the models with and without reflection symmetry . in the disordered case",
    "a number of attempts were made to formulate a kind of universality rules based on the mean - field investigation of the model systems with the random interactions.@xcite    looking now in general at the free energy series over the glass order parameter we see that the series contain explicitly the terms which can be classified by the reflection symmetry , @xmath16,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and the part without the reflection symmetry : the terms with three identical replica indices : @xmath17.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] thus , a natural question arises : whether there can be made a general statement regarding the behavior of sg models with and without reflection symmetry ? and do all models of the first type behave in fact as sk model and all models of the second type as @xmath15-spin spherical model ? in this paper",
    "we try to answer this question .",
    "we prove that for arbitrary models with the reflection symmetry the parisi frsb always takes place . in the absence of the reflection symmetry",
    "the situation is not so definite and the behavior of the system depends on some additional characteristics . in any case",
    "it is not always similar to that of he @xmath15-spin spherical model , as it was usually believed : we give the counterexamples .",
    "in this case it occurs to be possible to prove a kind of a theorem .",
    "first , we consider a generalized model with reflection symmetry with the hamiltonian ( [ sk ] ) , with the interactions distributed according to eq.([gauss ] ) and with the arbitrary diagonal operators @xmath1 .",
    "the reflection symmetry implies that for any integer @xmath18 , @xmath19=0 .",

    "we find the ( trivial ) solution @xmath25 .",
    "the bifurcation condition looks like in this case : @xmath26 this equation coincides with @xmath27 [ see , e.g. , ref .  ] .",
    "it is very important that it is zero solution that bifurcates .",
    "investigating @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and so on , we see that the equations for the glass order parameters always contain the quantity @xmath31}/{\\operatorname{tr}[\\exp ( \\theta_{n\\mathrm{rsb}})]}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] therefore , one of the solutions of these equation is trivial at each of the @xmath32-steps , and the appearance of the @xmath33 solution can be regarded as the bifurcation of the trivial @xmath34 solution . in this case , the equation @xmath35 coincides with the corresponding branching condition ( [ ten ] ) .",
    "this means that in any case , the @xmath33 solutions at different stages of the symmetry breaking can exist at the temperature @xmath36 determined by this bifurcation condition , and so we always can look for @xmath37 solution . writing the free energy as a series over @xmath38 near @xmath39 ( up to the fourth order of magnitude inclusively ) we obtain @xmath40 in the leading approximation [ similar procedure in details",
    "was described in ] .",
    "it is also possible to write the free energy in the form of parisi with the only difference in the boundary conditions for the parisi function @xmath41 that now reads : @xmath42 \\right   \\}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] thus we have shown that in the case of systems with reversal symmetry , the infinite @xmath37 occurs at the very point at which the @xmath43 solution becomes unstable .",
    "in particular , our result means that magnetic systems of arbitrary spin with the interaction between the @xmath44-components behave in the same way .",
    "we consider below the models without the reflection symmetry .",
    "[ these models correspond to some real physical systems . ]",
    "it implies that we have the hamiltonian ( [ sk])-([gauss ] ) but without the condition ( [ odd ] ) for the operators @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to trace how the proof given above fails using the model proposed in ref .  .",
    "the difference between two cases is already manifested in the @xmath43 approximation . in the case",
    "when the condition ( [ odd ] ) is not fulfilled for the hamiltonian ( [ sk ] ) there is no trivial solution for the order parameters .",
    "the disorder smears out the first - order phase transition ; hence , instead of a transition , there is a smooth increase in the order parameters ( both glass and regular ) as the temperature decreases .",
    "this situation is seen in experiments on orientational glass phase in @xmath45hydrogen mixed crystals and in @xmath46.@xcite these substances present mixtures of spherically symmetric molecules and momentum bearing molecules .",
    "the corresponding glass was investigated on the base of the hamiltonian  ( [ sk ] ) with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49.@xcite the rsb solution branches continuously and smoothly on cooling breaking the rs results in a transition to the nonergodic phase of the quadrupolar glass .",
    "another example of a sg  like phase in the molecular crystal is the pure @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) under pressure.@xcite the possibility of the orientational order in the systems with the initially spherically symmetric molecule states is due to the involving of higher order orbital moments @xmath52 under pressure . with increase of the density the anisotropic interaction potential and the crystal field grow rapidly and the energy of the many body system can be lowered taking the advantage of the anisotropic interactions .",
    "the long range orientational order appears abruptly at a fixed value of pressure through the first order phase transition just as it takes place in ortho - para mixtures when the concentration of moment bearing molecules achieves certain fixed value . in the intermediate concentration range",
    "the frustration and disorder motivate the investigation of the quadrupole glass with @xmath53 .",
    "such a theory was constructed in  .",
    "the essential feature of the obtained intermediate phase is the coexistence of the orientational glass phase with the long range orientational order as it is seen in the experiment .",
    "we consider two other models describing sg  like states in real complex nonmagnetic systems , namely , in the cluster systems .",
    "although they are not the mixtures of the different kinds of particles with different interactions , one can find frustration and disorder , that is the background to consider these systems in the spirit of sg theory . now the operator @xmath1 in ( [ sk ] ) is replaced with continuous functions of the angles .    in ref .   a model for the low - temperature transition to the orientational glass state in solid molecular @xmath54",
    "was developed .",
    "although the molecules have nearly spherical shape , at low temperature there are two pronounced minima in the anisotropic part of the intermolecular interaction energy .",
    "it is possible to trace an analogy with the mixtures studying the role of the different types of the mutual molecular orientations . as a result",
    ", a model is constructed where the role of spin is played by certain combinations of the cubic harmonics .",
    "the results agree well with the experimental data : the coexistence of the glass state and the long - range orientational order and the existence of a wide maximum on the curve for the orientational part of the heat capacity .",
    "moreover , the above model permits considering the pressure dependence of the orientational transitions.@xcite    the other model we would like to mention is the sg  like freezing of clusters of different symmetries in supercooled liquids that gives a possible description of liquid  glass transition . in ref .",
    "we use the microscopic approach based on the equations for the distribution functions which in spirit of bogoliubov hierarchy give us an opportunity to analyze the intercluster interaction .",
    "we show that there exists a region of densities and temperatures where this interaction changes sign as a function of the cluster radius and there is hence frustration in the system .",
    "this is the base to write a hamiltonian of the form ( [ sk ] ) with different point group harmonics for @xmath1 and use standard methods of sg theory to describe the real glasses .",
    "so , we have considered a set of models with two - particle interaction where the absence of the reflection symmetry is caused by the characteristics of the operators @xmath1 themselves . in this case",
    "the @xmath32-solution bifurcates from the @xmath43 -solution smoothly , without a jump , and the coexistence of the glass order with the long range regular order takes place .",
    "we consider now a generalization of the well - known @xmath15-spin model @xcite of ising spins where spins are replaced by arbitrary diagonal operators .",
    "then the hamiltonian is @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath15 is the number of interacting particles and @xmath1 is an arbitrary diagonal operator such that @xmath57 .",
    "we do not specify its form here , in order to use general expressions further .",
