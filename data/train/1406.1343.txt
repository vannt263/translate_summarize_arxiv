    "chemistry in one dimension ( 1d ) is interesting for many experimental and theoretical reasons , but also in its own right .",
    "experimentally , 1d systems can be realized in carbon nanotubes , @xcite organic conductors , @xcite transition metal oxides , @xcite edge states in quantum hall liquids , @xcite semiconductor heterostructures , @xcite confined atomic gases , @xcite and atomic or semiconducting nanowires . theoretically ,",
    "burke and coworkers @xcite have shown that 1d systems can be used as a `` theoretical laboratory '' to study strong correlation in `` real '' three - dimensional ( 3d ) chemical systems within density - functional theory .",
    "@xcite herschbach and coworkers calculated the ground - state electronic energy of 3d systems by interpolating between exact solutions for the limiting cases of 1d and infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite    however , all these authors eschewed the coulomb operator @xmath1 because of its strong divergence at @xmath2 .",
    "for example , burke and coworkers @xcite used a softened version of the coulomb operator @xmath3 to study 1d chemical systems , such as light atoms ( , , , ,  ) , ions ( , , ,  ) , and diatomics ( and ) .",
    "herschbach and coworkers have worked intensively on the 1d he atom,@xcite replacing the usual coulomb inter - particle interactions with the dirac delta function @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite there are few studies using the true coulomb operator and most of these focus on non - atomic and non - molecular systems .",
    "@xcite we prefer the coulomb operator because , although it is not the solution of the 1d poisson equation , it pertains to particles that are _ strictly _ restricted to move in a one - dimensional sub - space of three - dimensional space .",
    "the first 1d chemical system to be studied was the h atom by loudon . @xcite despite its simplicity , this model has been useful for studying the behavior of many physical systems , such as rydberg atoms in external fields @xcite or the dynamics of surface - state electrons in liquid helium @xcite and its potential application to quantum computing .",
    "@xcite most work since loudon has focused on one - electron ions@xcite and , to the best of our knowledge , no calculation has been reported for larger chemical systems . in part , this can be attributed to the ongoing controversy concerning the mathematical structure of the eigenfunctions .",

    "because of the singularity of the coulomb interaction in 1d , the electronic wave function has nodes at all points where two electrons touch .",
    "@xcite as a result , all 1d systems are spin - blind@xcite and we are free to assume that all electrons have the same spin .",
    "this also means that the pauli exclusion principle forbids _ any _ two electrons in 1d to have the same quantum state and , in independent - electron models such as hartree - fock ( hf ) theory,@xcite orbitals have a maximum occupancy of one .",
    "unless otherwise stated , atomic units are used throughout : total energies in hartrees ( @xmath5 ) , correlation energies in millihartrees ( @xmath6 ) and bond lengths in bohrs .",
    "because of the impenetrability of the 1d coulomb potential , @xcite electrons can not pass from one side of a nucleus to the other and are trapped on domains which are either rays ( to the left or right of the molecule ) or line segments ( between nuclei ) .",
    "the resulting domain occupations lead to families of states which can be defined by specifying the occupied orbitals in each domain .",
    "for example , the notation denotes an atom of nuclear charge @xmath7 whose @xmath8th left orbital and @xmath9th right orbitals are ( singly ) occupied .",
    "likewise , indicates an atom with two electrons , in the @xmath8th and @xmath9th orbitals , on the right side of the nucleus .",

    "when consecutive orbitals are occupied in the same domain , we use dashes .",
    "for example , implies that the three lowest orbitals between the nuclei are occupied .",
    "we have followed the methods developed by hylleraas @xcite and james and coolidge @xcite to compute the exact or near - exact energies @xmath10 of one- , two- , and three - electron systems .",

    "table [ tab : tablemol ] reports the mp2 , mp3 and exact correlation energies at the equilibrium geometries of , , and .",
    "all these values are small compared to their 3d analogs because correlation energy in these 1d systems is entirely due to dispersion . as a result ,",
    "correlation effects are pleasingly small and , for example , the hf bond length in differs from the exact value by only @xmath65 bohr .",
    "this re - emphasizes that the hf approximation is probably significantly more accurate in 1d than in 3d .",
    "the range of @xmath66 values ( @xmath67 in , @xmath68 in , @xmath69 in , @xmath70 in ) can be rationalized by comparing the distance between the two electrons in each system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : h2-bond ] ) : shorter distances yield larger correlation energies .    for the diatomics in table [ tab : tablemol ] , hf theory is again found to be accurate and the mpn series appears to converge rapidly towards the exact correlation energies . in particular , the mp3 and exact energies differ by only a few microhartrees .      the 3d ion was discovered by thomson@xcite in 1911 and plays a central role in interstellar chemistry . @xcite in astrochemistry , the main pathway for its production is @xmath71 and this reaction is highly exothermic ( @xmath72 @xmath5 ) .",

    "our calculations predict that reactions and are both exothermic ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath5 , respectively ) and that reaction is barrierless .",
    "it is interesting that the exothermicities of reactions and are close , and that the proton affinities ( reactions and ) are also broadly similar .",
    "despite the fact that equi - spaced infinite chain in 3d suffers from a peierls instability , @xcite this system has attracted considerable interest due to its strong correlation character and metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite we have therefore used periodic hf calculations@xcite to compute the energy per atom of an infinite chain of equi - spaced 1d atoms separated by a distance @xmath42 .",
    "motivated by our results for 1d , and , we have studied the state in which one electron is trapped between each pair of nuclei , i.e. .",
    "we have expanded the hf orbital in the unit cell ( @xmath81 $ ] ) as a linear combination of @xmath82 even polynomials .",
    "we find that , near the minimum - energy structure , @xmath83 suffices to achieve convergence of the hf energy to within one microhartree and the resulting bond length is @xmath84 , which is slightly longer than the values in , and .",
    "the corresponding energy is @xmath85 which yields a binding energy of @xmath86 per bond . in comparison ,",
    "the binding energy in is roughly 80% of this value .",
    "this explains the particular stability of the equally - spaced chain in 1d .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure of 1d chemical systems in which all nuclei and electrons are constrained to remain on a line . we have used the full coulomb operator and our numerical results are strikingly different from those of previous studies@xcite in which a softened operator was used .",
    "we have explored atoms with up to 10 electrons , one- and two - electron diatomics , the chemistry of and an infinite chain of atoms .",
    "we find that , whereas atoms with odd numbers of electrons have non - vanishing dipole moments and are reactive , atoms with even numbers of electrons have zero dipole moments and are inert .",
    "based on these results , we have concluded that the 1d version of the periodic table has only two groups : alkali metals and noble gases .",
    "our study of one- and two - electron diatomics has revealed that atoms in 1d are bound together by strong one - electron bonds which arise primarily from electrostatic ( chiefly charge - dipole and dipole - dipole ) interactions .",
    "this leads to a variety of unexpected results , such as the discovery that the bond in is much stronger than the bond in .",
