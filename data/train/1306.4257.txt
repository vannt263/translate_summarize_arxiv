    "the promising and interesting physical properties of graphene@xcite have recently stimulated active research in other atomically thin materials , alternative and/or complementary to graphene.@xcite molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) , fabricated in its single - layer by means of mechanical exfoliation , exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.8 - 1.9 ev , contrary to the indirect band gap of its bulk counterpart.@xcite moreover , single - layer mos@xmath0 has also shown a mobility of 200 @xmath1vs which makes it appealing for the design of a new generation of more efficient transistors.@xcite in the field of spintronics , the absence of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure of single - layer mos@xmath0 allows valley polarization by optical pumping with circularly polarized light.@xcite this makes possible the design of devices based on spin and valley control.@xcite more recently , a remarkable seebeck coefficient has been measured in single - layer mos@xmath0 , opening a new field of application for those materials.@xcite concerning the optical properties , the photoluminescence in single - layers has shown higher efficiency than in multi - layers or bulk which is attributed to the direct/ indirect band - gaps , respectively .",
    "the absorption spectra however are very similar in all the cases,@xcite an issue not yet explained .",
    "the observed double - peak structure in the absorption spectra can be connected to the splitting of the valence band maximum around the high - symmetry point @xmath2 .",
    "for single - layer mos@xmath0 , this splitting was explained as a consequence of spin - orbit coupling which is a result of the missing inversion symmetry.@xcite for bilayer and bulk , this splitting is mainly due to inter - layer interaction.@xcite    in this context , reliable _ ab initio _ calculations of the absorption spectra are necessary for providing the correct interpretation of the reported experimental results .",
    "however , the inherent complexity of the bethe - salpeter equation@xcite that is usually used to describe the excitonic effects in the optical spectra seems to be the reason for recent inadequately converged calculations . in ref .",
    "the excitonic binding energy is strongly overestimated due to a low k - point sampling and in refs .   and   spin - orbit interaction was entirely neglected and the splitting of the excitonic peak is merely due to an unconverged k - point sampling .",
    "the aim of our work is to provide well - converged optical spectra , in the framework of the bethe - salpeter equation _ including the effects of spin - orbit coupling_. this gives a reliable basis for the interpretation of previous experimental works on single- , double - layer and bulk mos@xmath0 .",
    "we show that the the optical spectrum corresponds essentially to a step - function that is the result of the joint - density of states for parabolic dispersion in two - dimensional systems .",
    "excitonic effects shift part of the oscillator strength into a discrete excitonic peak below the continuum onset .",
    "the splitting of this excitonic peak can be directly related to the splitting of the valence band maximum around @xmath2 and is thus entirely due to spin - orbit coupling in the case of the single - layer and mostly ( but not entirely ) due to inter - layer interaction for double , and multi - layer mos@xmath0 .",
    "starting point of the calculation of optical spectra are the kohn - sham wave functions and energies calculated with density - functional theory ( dft ) in the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we use the code abinit@xcite where wave - functions are expanded in plane - waves and core electrons are simulated by norm - conserving relativistic pseudopotentials.@xcite the plane - wave energy cutoff is 30 a.u . for molybdenum , the 4s and 4p semi - core electrons",
    "are explicitly calculated ( in addition to the 4d and 5s valence electrons ) .",
    "this turns out to be crucial for the proper calculation of the exchange - contribution to the self - energy term in the gw calculations .",
    "as noted earlier,@xcite spin - orbit interaction is important for mos@xmath0 and we calculate the spinor - wavefunctions as input for the following calculations on the level of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the inherent underestimation of the bandgap given by dft is corrected with the gw method.@xcite we use the non - self consistent version ( denoted as g@xmath3w@xmath3 ) without updating the dielectric function in the screened coulomb potential ( w ) or the wave - functions and energies in the green s function ( g ) .",
    "these calculations are done with the yambo code.@xcite the dielectric function @xmath4 is calculated using the plasmon - pole approximation@xcite .",
    "50 g - vectors are used ( for a vacuum distance of 40 a.u . between the periodic images of the single - layer / double - layer calculations ) .",
    "200 unoccupied bands are used in the integration of the self - energy term , yielding converged band - gap corrections for single - layer , double - layer , and bulk .",
    "the @xmath5-point sampling is @xmath6 for single and double - layer and @xmath7 for bulk .",
    "the value of the gw - correction to the band - gap depends on the inter - layer distance in the periodic supercells approach .",
    "it increases with increasing distance and converges roughly as @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the supercell dimension perpendicular to the layer ) .",
    "this was shown for single layers of hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn)@xcite and for single - layers of mos@xmath0.@xcite at the same time , the excitonic binding energy was also shown to increase roughly as @xmath8 such that the two effects cancel and the resulting optical spectra hardly depend on the inter - layer distance . in our calculations , we use @xmath10 a.u .  for the single layer calculations and of @xmath11 a.u .  for the double - layer",
    "starting from the kohm - sham wave - functions and the quasi - particle energies , the optical - spectra are calculated on the level of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse):@xcite @xmath12    here , the electronic excitations are expressed in the basis of electron - hole pairs ( i.e. , vertical excitations at a given @xmath5-point from a state in the valence band with quasi - particle energy @xmath13 to a conduction - band state with energy @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 are the expansion coefficients of the excitons in the electron - hole basis and the @xmath16 are the eigenenergies ( corresponding to the possible excitation energies of the system ) .",
    "if the interaction kernel @xmath17 is absent , eq .",
    "( [ bethesalpeter ] ) simply yields @xmath18 , i.e. , the excitations of the system correspond to independent electron - hole pairs .",
    "the interaction kernel @xmath17 describes the screened coulomb interaction between electrons and holes , and the exchange interaction , which includes the so called local fields effect .",
    "@xmath17 `` mixes '' different single - particle excitations , from valence band states @xmath19 to conduction band states @xmath20 , giving rise to modified transition energies @xmath16 and ( possibly ) also to discrete excitonic states below the onset of the continuum .    the optical absorption spectrum is given by the imaginary part of the dielectric function , @xmath21 , and can be calculated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the dipole matrix elements for electronic transitions from valence to conduction states .",
    "we consider only light absorption with polarization , and thus the direction of the dipole operator @xmath24 , in the plane identified by the @xmath25 layer .",
    "the out - of - plane polarization gives negligible contribution to absorption at low energies , because the local fields , which are strongly inhomogeneous in that direction , shift the oscillator strength to high energies .",
    "excluding phonon - assisted transitions , the momentum @xmath26 is conserved in the absorption process .",
    "we use an energy broadening @xmath27 ev in all the calculations to mimic the experimental resolution .",
    "the bse calculations have been performed with the code yambo.@xcite since a much higher @xmath26-point sampling than for the gw - calculations is needed , we use lda wave - functions and energies , corrected by a `` scissor''-operator obtained from the gw - calculations .",
    "while this approach does not take into account changes in the valence and conduction band dispersions , we have checked for the excitonic spectrum at a sampling of @xmath6 ( single - layer ) that the difference to a bse - calculation based on gw - energies is negligible .",
    "first we study the electronic structure of single - layer , double - layer and bulk mos@xmath0 .",
    "it is worth to mention that an accurate calculation of the exchange interaction in both the gw approximation and the bse requires the use of semi - core ( 4s and 4p ) orbitals for the molybdenum atoms .",
    "the omission of semi - core states can lead to an erroneous wave - vector dependence of the gw - correction .",
    "furthermore , the spin - orbit interaction has to be taken into account because it removes the degeneracy of the valence band maximum .",
    "single - layer mos@xmath0 ( and , in general , odd number of layers ) belongs to the group of symmetry @xmath28,@xcite which lacks inversion symmetry .",
    "this absence of symmetry , together with the strong spin - orbit coupling of molybdenum @xmath9 orbitals , splits the valence band edge at @xmath2.@xcite mos@xmath0 with even number of layers , such as the double - layer , and the bulk , instead , belong to the symmetry group @xmath29 , which does have inversion symmetry . nevertheless , also in this case a valence band splitting exists but it is caused ( predominantly ) by the interlayer interaction .",
    "figure [ band ] shows the band structure , calculated with lda and gw , for single- , double - layer and bulk mos@xmath0 .",
    "the only case where a direct bandgap is observed is the single - layer , either in lda or in gw , while for double - layer and bulk the bandgap is clearly indirect .",
    "the origin of this difference is the interlayer interaction .",
    "a second minimum in the conduction band lies on the high - symmetry line between @xmath30 and @xmath2 ( see vertical dashed lines ) . for the single - layer ,",
    "this minimum is higher in energy than the one at @xmath2 but in the double - layer and bulk , the inter - layer interaction leads to a splitting which shifts the minimum to a lower energy than the minimum at @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , in the double - layer and in the bulk , the valence band edge at @xmath30 rises higher than the valence band maximum at @xmath31 . as a consequence the system moves from a direct band - gap to an indirect gap semi - conductor .",
    "the gw corrections are generally larger for single - layer mos@xmath0 then for the double - layer and the bulk , due to the smaller dielectric screening in the single - layer case .",
    "our band - structures and their interpretation agree very well with the ones of the recent self - consistent gw calculations,@xcite even though details in the approximations are different : in our study , we do not use self - consistency in the gw - calculations which seems to add only a minor energy - shift to the g@xmath3w@xmath3 calculation . in turn",
    ", we perform the gw calculations with the full spinor wave - functions while in ref .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is introduced after the gw - calculations by rediagonalizing the hamiltonian matrices .",
    "the values of the direct band gaps at @xmath2 are summarized in table  [ band - table ] , combined with the valence band splitting . the values are in reasonable agreement with the ones of ref .  .",
    "small differences may be due to the differences in the approximations and from the different values of the cell dimensions .",
    "we remark in this context the importance of the lattice constant .",
    "small variations of the latter can shift the position of the conduction and valence band edges . commonly to other gw calculations , we thus use experimental lattice parameters ( in - plane lattice constant a=3.15  and c=12.3  for bulk@xcite ) in order to avoid artificial strain effects.@xcite a similar conclusion is drawn in a recent theoretical study about the influence of strain in the bandgap of mos@xmath0 , where strain tends to transform the single - layer mos@xmath0 into an indirect band - gap semiconductor.@xcite    lccc + & 1-layer & 2-layer & bulk + @xmath32 ( lda ) & 1.69 & 1.68 & 1.67 + @xmath32 ( gw ) & 2.41 & 2.32 & 2.23 + @xmath33 ( lda ) & 134.3 & 173.8 & 220.1 + @xmath33 ( gw ) & 112.0 & 160.0 & 230.6 +",
    "in the calculation of the optical absorption spectra of mos@xmath0 , the convergence with respect to @xmath26-sampling is of crucial importance in order to obtain reliable spectra ( see appendix ) .",
    "we used a @xmath34 k - point in the case of the single - layer and double - layer and @xmath35 in the case of bulk .",
    "local fields are included in all the calculations.@xcite we show in fig .  [ bse ] , the calculated optical spectra for single- , double - layer and bulk mos@xmath0 .",
    "the results of the bse are compared with the optical spectra without the excitonic effects , calculated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa , independent - particle picture ) using the gw - energies ( panels a - c ) .",
    "the lda and gw band - gap energies are marked with vertical . finally ( panels d - f ) the bse results are compared with the experimental data@xcite . in panels",
    "d - f the theoretical results are down - shifted by approximately 0.2 ev in order to compare with the experiments .",
    "this discrepancy is in the margin error of common gw and bethe - salpeter calculations .",
    "our results give a clear interpretation of the measured absorption spectra , in the low energy range , and provide reliable predictions within the given accuracy of @xmath36 0.2 ev , for the higher energy range , for which no experimental data are available .",
    "the general features of the three optical spectra are very similar , with a double peak structure ( denoted as @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) at the energy threshold , accompanied by a plateau , and afterwards an abrupt increase of the optical absorption . the rpa spectrum below 2.8 ev resembles in all three cases the sum of two heaviside step functions .",
    "the difference in the two step positions is given by the splitting of the valence band maximum at @xmath2 .",
    "this step function profile is the fingerprint of the joint density of states of a 2d - system , with parabolic band structure .",
    "`` switching on '' excitonic effects , preserves the plateau , but , in addition , a split excitonic peak below the onset of the continuum transition occurs .",
    "the exciton binding energy is different in the three cases .",
    "it is largest for the single - layer , where the electron - hole interaction is less screened .",
    "the differences in quasi - particle band gap and excitonic binding energy almost cancel each other@xcite and the resulting excitonic peak positions are almost the same in the three cases . the peaks can be directly assigned to the peaks denoted @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the experiments.@xcite at higher energies , the relevant peak placed at 3.0 ev ( close to the blue color in the visible spectrum ) in the single - layer has larger relative intensity with respect to the peaks @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "such intense peak has not yet been reported , as the maximum detection energy in absorption experiments is around 2.4 ev.@xcite    a further inspection of the excitonic eigenvectors allows to assign to each excitonic peak the contributing electron - hole transitions and their location at the brillouin zone . in all the cases , excitons @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "come from the energy transition at the @xmath2 point , even when the band gap is indirect .",
    "this explains the similarity of the experimental optical absorption .",
    "the other relevant peak , at 3.0 ev , comes from the part of the brillouin zone between @xmath2 and @xmath30 ( marked with a dashed line in fig .  [ band ] ) , where we observe a high density of states due to the parallel conduction and valence bands.@xcite    , obtained with the bs equation ( solid lines ) and rpa ( dashed lines ) .",
    "lda and gw band gaps at @xmath2 are marked with vertical dashed lines , the absorption threshold is marked with a vertical solid line .",
    "note that the wiggles above 2.5 ev in panel ( c ) are due to finite k - point sampling .",
    "panels ( d)(f ) : symbols : experimental absorption spectra@xcite in comparison with the calculations ( solid lines , shifted by about -0.2 ev ) . ]    to gain further insight of the optical spectra , we represent the excitonic wavefunctions related to the main peaks of the bethe - salpeter spectra .",
    "the excitonic wave - function can be written as :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the real - space electron and hole coordinate and @xmath42 the lda wave functions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian of the bethe - salpeter equation ( with energy @xmath16 ) . in order to represent",
    "the six - coordinate function , we fix the hole position 1.0  above a molybdenum atom and we project onto the function @xmath44 onto the x - y plane . figure  [ exciton](a ) shows the exciton wave function of the exciton @xmath37 of the mos@xmath0 single - layer ( for double - layer and bulk the wave function is essentially identical ) .",
    "this exciton is largely spread , extended over 65  , in concordance with the small binding energy and with the small effect on the absorption threshold , as reported in the experiments.@xcite this also explains the large @xmath26-point grid needed to converge the results in the bethe - salpeter equation ( see appendix ) .",
    "the exciton @xmath38 ( not shown here ) shows similar trends .    on the opposite , in fig .",
    "[ exciton](b ) we observe that the brightest exciton , at 3.0 ev , is remarkably localized , being confined to less than 30  , with a trigonal shape . among the properties of such exciton we point out the potentially high efficiency of recombination .",
    "another interesting point ( for multi - layer and bulk ) is to explore if the excitons are confined in one layer or if their wavefunctions extend over several layers . with this aim",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ exciton](d ) the exciton @xmath37 of the mos@xmath0 bulk .",
    "the wave function spreads largely within the plane but it is undoubtedly constricted to one layer . the density in neighboring layers is negligible and the wave - function is very similar to the one of the @xmath37 exciton in the single layer ( fig .",
    "[ exciton](c ) ) .",
    "the large interlayer distance , due to the weak van der waals interaction , prevents the wave function from spreading to other layers , analogously to what happens in bulk boron nitride.@xcite",
    "we have performed calculations of the quasi - particle band - structure and of the optical absorption spectra of single , double - layer , and bulk mos@xmath0 including excitonic effects and spin - orbit coupling at the same time . in agreement with previous calculations and with experimental evidence from photoluminescence",
    "intensities,@xcite our gw - calculations demonstrate that only single - layer mos@xmath0 has a direct band gap at @xmath2 .",
    "the inter - layer interaction makes the band gap indirect for multi - layer and bulk mo@xmath45 .",
    "however , this does not particularly influence the optical absorption spectra in the visible range .",
    "these display in all cases a strong excitonic peak ( composed of electron - hole pairs around @xmath2 ) below the onset of continuum transitions which has the step function shape , corresponds to the quasi-2d joint - density of states . the layered - structure of the material confines the first exciton mostly in a single - layer which causes the similarity of the optical spectrum in all the cases .",
    "the position of the split excitonic peak is remarkably stable with respect to the number of layers ( and with respect to the inter - layer spacing in the calculation for single - layer mos@xmath0 ) .",
    "this has been previously explained as a cancellation effect between the band - gap correction due to electron - electron interaction and the excitonic binding energy due to electron - hole interaction@xcite .",
    "the splitting of the excitonic peak is directly related to the splitting of the valence band maximum around @xmath2 and is entirely due to spin - orbit coupling for the single - layer and ( mostly ) due to inter - layer interaction for the double - layer and bulk . at higher energy ( around 3 ev ) , the optical spectrum is dominated by electron - hole pairs from transitions around the center of the line @xmath46 where both valence and conduction bands have a minimum and the parallel shape of the bands causes a maximum in the joint density - of - states . for the single - layer a strongly - bound exciton causes an additional peak in the spectrum at 3.0 ev . for double - layer and bulk",
    ", the shape of the spectrum changes and may allow for a spectroscopic distinction between layer numbers .",
    "the authors acknowledges financial support from the anr ( french national research agency ) through project anr-09-blan-0421 - 01 .",
    "calculations were done at the idris supercomputing center , orsay ( proj .",
    "091827 ) , and at the tirant supercomputer of the university of valencia ( group vlc44 ) .",
    "the convergence of the optical spectra is a mandatory issue to obtain reliable spectra , comparable with the experimental data .",
    "we have performed calculations to check the convergence of the spectra , and in particular of the position of the first excitonic peak with respect to the @xmath26-point sampling .",
    "a fine sampling can be quite costly in terms of computation time and in some bethe - salpeter calculations may reach unexpectedly large values .",
    "figure  [ convergence ] shows the bethe - salpeter spectra of mos@xmath0 single - layer for several @xmath26-grids ( for simplicity we have omitted the spin - orbit coupling ) .",
    "additionally , we have represented the exciton binding energy , @xmath47 , as a function of the number of irreducible @xmath26-points , marking in each case the corresponding grid .",
    "we observe the slow convergence of the first excitonic peak , not reached before a @xmath48 sampling .",
    "moreover , for small grids some secondary and artificial peaks appear in the spectrum and the underlying heaviside function of the optical absorption is not reached unless dense grids are used ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this value is considerably larger than the one used in ref   where only a @xmath50 grid was used , leading to isolated peaks in the absorption spectra where the density of states predicts a plateau following the excitonic peak .",
    "our test calculations also explain why in refs .  and",
    "split excitonic peaks were observed even though spin - orbit coupling was not included .",
    "the exciton binding energy @xmath47 also needs at least an @xmath51 grid to be converged within 0.1 ev .",
    "it is worth to note that the second excitonic peak ( the most intense ) , located at 2.5 ev converges much faster , approximately for a @xmath52 grid .",
    "the difference behavior of those excitons can be better understood by inspection of their wave functions , shown in fig .",
    "[ exciton](a ) and ( b ) . in the case of the first peak ,",
    "the wave function is very spread , more than 18 unit cells in each direction on the plane .",
    "we remind that a @xmath53 grid in the reciprocal space allows only to map the exciton wave function in the real space @xmath53 the unit cell , therefore , inadequately small grids lead to an artificial confinement of the exciton which increases its binding energy .",
    "this arguments also clarifies why the second exciton converge much faster , its wave function being confined within a few unit cells .",
