    "the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) is a one - parameter family of random curves in two dimensions introduced by schramm  @xcite while studying possible scaling limits of loop - erased random walk . in this paper",
    ", schramm proved that if the scaling limit exists , is conformally invariant , and satisfies a certain domain markov property then the scaling limit must be sle(@xmath1 ) , a random curve generated by the loewner equation with a brownian motion of variance @xmath1 as its driving function .",
    "the existence of this conformally invariant scaling limit was later confirmed by lawler , schramm and werner  @xcite who proved weak convergence of the properly rescaled discrete curves to sle@xmath2 as random curves modulo reparameterization .",
    "the goal of the present work is to discuss a stronger convergence of loop - erased random walk to sle@xmath2 , namely convergence with respect to a topology that fully takes into account the time parametrization of the curves .",
    "we outline a possible strategy for the proof that loop - erased random walk converges to sle@xmath2 in the natural time parametrization , and although we are unable to rigorously establish all of the steps in the proof , we believe that there is value in recording the partial results that we have obtained .",
    "in particular , we have been able to identify the specific loop - erased random walk estimates that are needed to carry out our strategy and deduce strong convergence .",
    "consider a loop - erased random walk on @xmath0 started at the origin , and suppose that @xmath3 is the first time that it reaches the circle of radius @xmath4 .",
    "assume further that it moves at unit speed between sites .",
    "let @xmath5 be its time reversal so that @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is a continuous , piecewise - linear function from the circle of radius @xmath4 to the origin .",
    "in order to prove that loop - erased random walk converges to sle@xmath2 in the natural time parametrization there are two things that need to be done , namely    ( i ) : :    to show that if @xmath8 is a suitable `` speed    function '' ( i.e. , continuous and increasing ) , then    @xmath9converges    weakly as @xmath10 with respect to the topology of    the supremum norm on curves , and ( ii ) : :    to identify the limit as sle(2 ) in a particular parametrization .",
    "recent developments make both parts of this problem appear more tractable .",
    "the first , which concerns ( ii ) , is lawler and sheffield s identification  @xcite of the `` natural '' parametrization for the sle(2 ) curve ; see  @xcite for extensions of this result . under schramm s original definition of sle the curves",
    "are parametrized so that their capacity grows linearly .",
    "this is the best way to analyze the curves by way of the loewner equation , but is not natural when one considers sle as the scaling limit of a discrete model .",
    "the second development , concerning ( i ) , is barlow and masson s tightness bounds  @xcite on a certain rescaling of @xmath3 .",
    "the ideal choice of speed function is @xmath11 because of the long - standing physical prediction  @xcite that the growth exponent for loop - erased random walk is @xmath12 . but",
    "proving ( i ) for this speed function is difficult for the following reason : if @xmath13 converges in law under the topology of the supremum norm ( see section  [ backgroundsect ] for an exact definition ) then so too does the _ lifetime _ of the curve . for the choice @xmath14 the lifetime is @xmath15 , but it is not even known that this sequence of random variables is tight , let alone that it has a limiting distribution .",
    "showing such a result appears to be genuinely difficult .",

    "the best known result is that @xmath17}}{\\log n } = \\frac{5}{4}.\\ ] ] this was originally proved by kenyon  @xcite , and later reproved by masson  @xcite using different methods .",
    "subsequently , barlow and masson  @xcite proved that the family @xmath18}}\\ ] ] is tight ( although they say nothing about the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath16}$ ] directly ) . for us",
    ", this makes @xmath19}t$ ] an attractive choice of speed function as it guarantees that the lifetime of @xmath13 is tight . of course",
    ", this alone is not sufficient to prove ( i ) , but it is a suggestive starting point .",
    "kenyon s proof of   is based on estimates of the probability that loop - erased random walk goes through a particular edge ; see also  @xcite for related results .",
    "a recent paper by lawler  @xcite has improved kenyon s estimates by showing that for loop - erased random walk connecting opposite sides of an @xmath20 square , there is probability @xmath21 , up to multiplicative constants , that a particular edge in the middle is used .",
    "it is expected ( but not yet proved ) that this result can be strengthened to show that @xmath16 } \\asymp n^{5/4}$ ] , after some additional work of transferring the result from the `` chordal '' case to the `` radial '' case .",
    "combined with the result of barlow and masson  @xcite , this would prove that @xmath22 is tight .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ backgroundsect ]",
    "we review the basics of the schramm - loewner evolution , including a careful statement that loop - erased random walk converges weakly to sle(2 ) in the topology of the supremum norm on curves modulo reparametrization .",
    "we then discuss the natural parametrization for sle and how the time parametrization can be encoded as an occupation measure with natural conformal covariance and domain markov properties . in section  [ sectconvstrat ]",
    ", we outline the steps in our strategy for showing convergence of loop - erased random walk to sle@xmath2 with respect to the topology of the supremum norm on curves . the basic idea is to show convergence of the random occupation measures defined by the discrete curves by proving that their law is tight and that any subsequential limit has the unique set of properties that characterize the sle natural occupation measure . in this way",
    ", our strategy mimics the original proof of convergence modulo time parametrization .",
    "as mentioned , we are not currently able to rigorously complete all of the steps in our strategy .",
    "however , in section  [ lerwsect ] we are able to establish some partial results on convergence of the expected occupation measure for the discrete curves to the expected occupation measure for the sle@xmath2 curve .",

    "equivalently , but perhaps more simply stated , the natural occupation measure is just the standard euclidean length measure on the curve .",

    "it is not immediate that this is true .",
    "for example , the term @xmath247 is a positive _ local martingale _ ( and hence a supermartingale ) that blows up if the curve reaches @xmath27 , or stays bounded and goes to zero when the curve reaches the origin .",
    "since we are dealing with sle(@xmath1 ) the curve never reaches a fixed point @xmath27 and hence the local martingale evolves as a true martingale ; its increasing part is therefore zero .",

    "this is the intuition behind the existence part of conjecture  [ conj : existence ] but it requires several difficult estimates to rigorously prove it .",
    "finally , given the occupation measure , the sle curve in the natural time parameterization is constructed using the map @xmath62 defined in the last section .",

    "hence it has a continuous inverse @xmath252 , i.e. , @xmath253 , and the sle curve in the natural time parameterization is defined by @xmath254 note that the decomposition above is for a particular representative of @xmath51 ( for example , the capacity parameterization ) but that @xmath255 is ultimately independent of the choice of representative . indeed , if @xmath56 is any other representation , then it is a reparameterization of @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath256 for some increasing homeomorphism @xmath257 , and a loewner chain for @xmath145 is a time change of the loewner chain for @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath258 .",

    "tightness of @xmath270 follows from lawler - schramm - werner  @xcite , hence what remains is tightness of the occupation measures .",

    "more precisely , for @xmath271",
    "the subsets @xmath272 are compact in @xmath150 , hence it is sufficient to show that @xmath273 is a tight random variable .",

    "show that the lifetime @xmath277 $ ] is tight . for @xmath14",
    ", there are no known tightness results on the lifetime @xmath22 , although work in progress might change this .",
    "we point out that tightness of the lifetime of @xmath13 is also a necessary condition for tightness of @xmath274 .",
    "the map @xmath278 from @xmath279 is continuous in the lvy - prokhorov metric , hence tightness of @xmath274 implies tightness of @xmath273",
    ". moreover , since we are working under the product topology the tightness of @xmath273 is also necessary for the tightness of the pair @xmath267 .    in the rest of this section",
    "we assume that the pair @xmath267 is tight , and we use @xmath280 to denote any subsequential limit .",
    "we devote the rest of this section to outlining a strategy for showing subsequential limits satisfy conditions 1 through 5 of conjecture  [ conj : existence ] .      to establish condition 2 of conjecture  [ conj : existence ]",
    "one must show that for any subsequential limit @xmath280 , the first coordinate is measurable with respect to the second . for most reasonable choices of the discrete parametrization",
    ", this will hold for @xmath281 , in particular , if @xmath274 is some variant of arclength measure on the curve .",
    "however , even if @xmath274 is measurable with respect to @xmath282 for each @xmath4 , it does not follow that this persists in the limit .",
    "measurability properties of this type are not necessarily preserved under weak convergence .",
    "for example , consider the measure on @xmath283 \\times [ -1,1]$ ] induced by @xmath284 where @xmath285 is uniformly distributed on @xmath283 $ ] .",
    "clearly , the second coordinate is measurable with respect to the first for each @xmath4 , but the same does not hold for the weak limit of the induced measure .",
    "there are two standard techniques for establishing this type of measurability .",
    "the first , which is used in  @xcite , is to show that conditionally on @xmath286 , the @xmath287 variable is independent of itself and hence a constant .",
    "the second approach , which is the one used in  @xcite , is to show that on the discrete level @xmath288 can be well - approximated by another random variable @xmath289 that is measurable with respect to @xmath282 , and that converges to a quantity that is also measurable with respect to @xmath286 . in  @xcite `` well - approximated '' means that @xmath290 goes to 0 in the @xmath291 sense .    for the present paper",
    "we believe the second approach is likely to be simpler to implement .",
    "although it will require many rigorous estimates , we expect one can choose @xmath289 to be the increasing part of the doob - meyer decomposition of @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the loewner map associated with the discrete curve @xmath13 . by convergence of @xmath282 to @xmath46 we expect that this quantity will be close to the analogous quantity for @xmath46 , and that measurability will follow by similar considerations .      thus far , we have only discussed convergence of loop - erased random walk to sle(2 ) in @xmath210 , but to carry out the full strategy one must tackle substantially more . as in the original paper by lawler , schramm , and werner  @xcite , to prove convergence in a single domain it is required to prove convergence in all domains .",
    "this is due to the nature of the strategy : one proves that the laws of the random objects have subsequential limits , and then shows that all subsequential limits share certain characterizing properties that identify them as being the same . for convergence modulo reparametrization one of the characterizing properties",
    "is conformal invariance of the curves . for convergence with the time parametrization taken into account this",
    "is replaced by conformal covariance of the random occupation measures .",
    "the conformal covariance rule for the random measures is discussed in section  [ lawsheffsect ] . a first step to establishing",
    "the conformal covariance is to show that for any subsequential limit on a given domain the expectation is the sle green s function on that domain .",
    "if this can be proved then it can be applied to show that conditional on @xmath294 where @xmath286 is the subsequential limit , the expected density of the remaining measure is the sle green s function in the remaining domain .",
    "this would imply a proof of   which , by the argument outlined in the proof of theorem  [ thm : uniqueness ] and the uniqueness of the doob - meyer decomposition , implies the domain markov property for the occupation measures .",
    "hence , we outline a strategy for showing that on any simply connected domain , the expectation of any subsequential limit of the random occupation measures is the sle green s function on that domain .",
    "let @xmath295 be a simply connected domain with @xmath129 , and let @xmath203 be the unique conformal transformation from @xmath29 to @xmath210 with @xmath204 and @xmath296 .",
    "let @xmath297 be the @xmath131 grid domain approximation of @xmath29 ; that is , the connected component containing the origin of the complement of the closed faces in @xmath131 intersecting @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath298 be the time reversal of loop - erased random walk on @xmath131 started at 0 and stopped when hitting @xmath299 .",
    "the time parametrization of @xmath298 is chosen so that @xmath300 for all @xmath301 where @xmath302 is a constant that depends only on the lattice spacing .",
    "write @xmath303 for the induced occupation measure on the edges of @xmath131 induced by the curve @xmath298 ; this is a scaled version of the arclength measure on the trace of @xmath298 .",

    "this is natural from the point of view of discrete lattice models , but to simplify the proof of conformal covariance it might be fruitful to make the choice of @xmath302 domain dependent . in particular , one could construct the discrete time parametrization in a `` domain - adapted '' way by making the time duration of each step depend on the remaining domain that the walk can move through .",
