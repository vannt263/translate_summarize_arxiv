    "the pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) or `` soft '' electric dipole resonances have attracted the interest of several research groups in the past decade @xcite .",
    "the pdr is defined as a part of the low - energy tail of the isovector dipole resonance ( gdr ) and dwells well below the gdr maximum . in phenomenological models",
    "these resonances are described as vibrations of the excess neutrons ( neutron skin ) against an inert core with n = z @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects little strength in n = z nuclei and increasing strength with increasing neutron excess . in exotic nuclei with extreme neutron excess",
    "these pdr should be especially pronounced .",
    "as the dipole strength near the nucleon separation energy strongly influences the r - process in astrophysics , the pdr in such nuclei is of importance for the nuclear synthesis .",
    "another important reason of the interest in the pdr are modern experimental techniques which allow to distinguish between 1@xmath6,2@xmath7 and 1@xmath7 states @xcite . in recent experiments new data have been obtained for several groups of isotopes ( see @xcite ) including the stable ca isotopes @xcite . the latter results for the three nuclei @xmath8,@xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are the bridge between light and medium weight nuclei , are especially interesting . the experiment shows a large difference in the summed e1 strengths of the pdr below 10 mev for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "surprisingly the ewsr of the pdr does not rise with the neutron excess but is roughly the same for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this contradicts the phenomenological models as well as microscopic rpa calculations @xcite .",
    "clearly , such an analysis should be performed within microscopic theoretical approaches which simultaneously describes the pdr and gdr and other nuclear structure properties .",
    "the models should not have free fitting parameters for each nucleus in order to obtain reliable results which allow to understand the underlying physics .",
    "such an analysis has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the three ca isotopes within the rpa based on the self - consistent density functional method and for heavier nuclei within the relativistic self - consistent rpa or qrpa based on the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model @xcite . in",
    "both approaches the self - consistency ensured a reliable comparison between different nuclei .",
    "goriely and khan @xcite calculated within the self - consistent qrpa the e1 strength distributions @xcite for all nuclei with @xmath11 between the proton and neutron drip lines using known skyrme forces . in their calculation the low - lying e1 strength was located systematically higher by some 3 mev compared with the available data .    in the past 15 years kamerdzhiev , speth , tertychny and tselyaev",
    "have developed the _ extended theory of finite fermi systems(etffs ) _ which uses the green function formalism , is based on the rpa and includes the single - particle continuum as well as the coupling to the low - lying phonons .",
    "it also considers the effect of the phonons in the ground state correlations .",
    "the authors have shown in numerous publications ( see @xcite and references therein ) , that this approach allows to calculate simultaneously low - lying as well as high lying nuclear structure properties in quantitative agreement with the experimental data . the model has been applied to all closed shell nuclei . as far as the electric dipole states are concerned",
    "the complete spectrum has always been calculated , but as the pdr are weak compared to the gdr they appear only as small fluctuations at the lower end of the gdr .",
    "the first calculations of the pdr within this model including pairing have been performed for ca @xcite and sn @xcite isotopes . here",
    "the characteristics of the pdr are in much better agreement with the data than the above mentioned self consistent calculations .",
    "this is due to coupling to the phonons , first of all , and due to another single - particle scheme",
    ". there exists a basic difference between the present approach and self - consistent ( q)rpa calculations e.g. @xcite as we will discuss below .",
    "long time ago the conventional ( 1p-1h ) rpa and qrpa have been extended to include the effects of phonons .",
    "soloviev et al . introduced 30 years ago the _ _ quasiparticle phonon model ( qpm)__@xcite , the present model @xmath12 was first applied nearly 15 years ago in ref.@xcite and around the same time broglia et al .",
    "developed the _ phonon coupling model(pcm ) _",
    "@xcite . however , the extended models @xcite have been used only recently to calculate the properties of pdr in non - magic nuclei because an additional work had to be done to include pairing to these models .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned results , the pdr calculations have been performed for @xmath13 @xcite and for a long sn isotopes chain @xcite within the qpm , for @xmath14,@xmath15 , @xmath13 ( together with the giant e1 resonances)@xcite and for @xmath16o,@xmath17o,@xmath18o @xcite within the pcm generalized to include pairing .",
    "very recently , the e1 photo absorption cross sections have been calculated in @xmath19 , @xmath14 and @xmath20 with a version of the etffs ( see below ) @xcite , which also considers pairing .",
    "so far the single - particle continuum for non - magic nuclei has been only taken into account in the present approach ( etffs ) @xcite .    in the recent @xmath21 calculations for the pdr in ca isotopes @xcite , several approximations ( for details see @xcite ) have been made which were responsible that the theoretical results agreed only qualitatively with the data .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is threefold : firstly , we repeat the previous calculations without the approximations and apply for @xmath1 the generalized version of the @xmath21 which includes the pairing effects , secondly we clarify the role of the continuum for pdr and gdr , which has attracted a great interest now @xcite , and finally we investigate in detail the microscopic structure of the pdr , especially the role of the isoscalar dipole components .",
    "the result of the present calculation agrees well with the experimental data @xcite and it explains in a natural way the somewhat surprising result that the strength of the pdr does ( seemingly ) not scale with the neutron excess .",
    "we have used the generalized version of the etffs with pairing which differs from the one used in @xcite by taking into account the self - energy and the induced ph- and pp- interaction graphs on the same footing , i.e. by a consistent summations of the so - called g@xmath22 diagrams where g is the amplitude for low - lying phonon creation . the formalism developed for nuclei with pairing ,",
    "is called _ quasiparticle time blocking approximation ( qtba ) _ , and is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite.(however , the ground state correlations induced by the phonon coupling have not been included to the present calculations ) .",
    "the single - particle continuum has been included on the rpa level where it is taken into account correctly within our green function technique in the coordinate representation .",
    "for details see @xcite .",
    "therefore in our approach we consider the three mechanisms which create the width of giant resonance , namely ( i ) the landau damping ( ( q)rpa configurations),(ii ) the escape width ( the single - particle continuum ) and ( iii ) the spreading width ( phonon coupling , or complex configurations ) . as in all our previous calculations within the etffs , we include the most collective low - lying phonons , namely 3@xmath23 , 5@xmath23 phonons for @xmath24ca , and 2@xmath25,3@xmath23,5@xmath23 phonons for @xmath26ca and @xmath27ca .",
    "the collective phonons have been microscopically calculated within the rpa for @xmath24ca and @xmath27ca . in the case of @xmath26ca",
    "we used the corresponding qrpa with pairing .",
    "the standard bcs equation have been applied using the particle - particle landau - migdal forces @xcite . in the present and in our previous calculations we used the special `` forced consistency '' procedure @xcite to obtain the energy of the spurious e1 state to be exactly equal to zero without the procedure of fitting force parameters .    as in our previous calculations",
    "we used the effective particle - hole landau - migdal interaction :    @xmath28 \\;{\\delta } ( { \\bf r } - { \\bf r'}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the conventional interpolation formula , for example , for the parameter f @xmath29 and similarly for the other @xmath30-dependent parameters . here",
    "@xmath31 is the density distribution of the ground state of the nucleus under consideration and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the force parameters inside and outside of the nucleus .",
    "the standard values of the parameters , which have been already used for all the nuclei under consideration @xcite , are as follows @xmath34 for the nuclear density @xmath31 in the interpolation formula we chose the theoretical ground state density distribution of the corresponding nucleus , @xmath35 which is more consistent than the previously used woods - saxon distribution .",
    "for that reason we had to readjust @xmath33 and obtained the value of @xmath33 = -1.4 used @xcite . here",
    "@xmath36 are the single - particle radial wave functions of the single - particle model used . for other details of the calculations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "ca , @xmath26ca , and @xmath27ca . dashed : experimental data taken from @xcite ; dash - dotted :",
    "quasiparticle random phase approximation , full : extended theory of finite fermi systems in the quasiparticle time blocking approximation ( including pairing for @xmath26ca ) ]    the main results of our calculations for the gross properties pdr are given in fig.1 and table  [ tab : t1 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath37 -c stands for calculations without continuum .",
    "the averaging parameter @xmath38 which was used in addition to the single - particle continuum the giant resonance calculation was 400 kev .",
    "the differences between the ( q)rpa and full etffs(qtba ) are most striking for the width @xmath39 and the maximum of the photo absorption cross section @xmath40 , where the results differ nearly by a factor of two .",
    "we obtain good agreement with the experiments only within our full model , i.e. including the phonons and the single - particle continuum . here",
    "we want to stress that we calculate gdr and the low - lying states simultaneously within the same configuration space and with the same forces .",
    "ca ; the isovector electric dipole strength is integrated in the ( 15 - 30 ) mev interval ]    as compared with our earlier results for @xmath0 and @xmath2 @xcite , here the ground state correlations induced by the phonon coupling were not taken into account and we have chosen a different energy interval for the summation .",
    "in addition , a different definition for the mean energy and another `` refining '' procedure @xcite have been used .",
    "like in the previous calculations of giant multipole resonances in closed shell nuclei @xcite the inclusion of phonon coupling , i.e. the calculation within the full etffs ( qtba ) , increases the widths by a factor of 2 and ( except for @xmath24ca ) shifts the mean energies by 1.0 - 1.5 mev to higher energy .    in fig.5",
    "the results for the gdr in @xmath1 are shown , calculated again within the three approximations . in the full model an appreciable fraction of the strength",
    "is shifted to much higher energies compared to the qrpa result which give rise to an asymmetric shape . finally in fig.6 the transition density for the gdr in @xmath1 is plotted .",
    "it has the expected isovector shape .    in order to study",
    "_ the role of the single - particle continuum _ we have calculated the giant resonance ( see table 2 and fig.5 ) and pdr characteristics without the continuum .",
    "it should be expected that the role of the single - particle continuum is important in light nuclei .",
    "it is of special interest to consider the question within the same calculational scheme for the ca isotopes , including the non - magic @xmath26ca , because there is no information about the role of the continuum in the approaches of similar kind in non - magic nuclei .",
    "one can see from table 2 and fig.5 a very noticeable influence of the continuum for the integral characteristics in all the ca isotopes as well as for the strength distribution .",
    "moreover , the continuum s influence is noticeable even for the pdr : our full calculations have given 0.38% of the ewsr in the ( 5.0 - 10.0 ) mev interval for @xmath26ca whereas the calculation without continuum gave 0.19% .",
    "the exclusion of the continuum also results in a considerable redistribution of the pdr strength .",
    "these features can be studied in experiments with electrons and gamma - rays .",
    "we have investigated the low - lying ( pdr ) and high - lying ( gdr ) electric dipole states in the magic @xmath24ca and @xmath27ca and non - magic @xmath26ca within the etffs(qtba ) which , in addition to the standard ( q)rpa , takes into account the single - particle continuum and phonon coupling . in the present approach we corrected for the double counting due to the phonons in our generalized propagator .",
    "good agreement with experiment available for integral characteristics has been found .",
    "the agreement for the pdr is much better as compared with the previous etffs calculations @xcite .",
    "the pdr , i.e. the isovector dipole strength below 10 mev , is less than 1 percent of the energy weighted sum rule because the strongly repulsive isovector force shift the strength into gdr region . in order to investigate the structure of the pdr",
    "further we calculated the corresponding transition densities .",
    "it turned out that these densities are isoscalar with some isovector admixture in @xmath26ca and @xmath27ca which is due to the strongly attractive isoscalar interaction which shifts the high - lying isoscalar strength below 10 mev .",
    "in @xmath24ca we obtain two prominent isoscalar dipole states ( induced by the external field @xmath41 ) at 5.8 mev and 7.8 mev .",
    "the predicted isoscalar strength can be detected in @xmath42 experiments , see @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the role of the single - particle continuum is very noticeable for the gdr and quantatively important for the pdr in the ca isotopes considered .",
    "the same should be true for lighter nuclei too .",
    "thus , taking into account the new effects as compared with the standard rpa or qrpa , i.e. the phonon coupling and single - particle continuum , is necessary to explain the properties of both these resonances .",
    "the authors are very thankful to n. luytorovich for permanent collaboration in the preparation of this article and to a.zilges for the information about the experiments @xcite . s.kamerdzhiev",
