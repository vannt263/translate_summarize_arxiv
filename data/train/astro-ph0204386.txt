    "deuterium is understood to be only produced in significant amount during primordial big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and thoroughly destroyed in stellar interiors .",
    "deuterium is thus a key element in cosmology and in galactic chemical evolution ( see e.g. audouze & tinsley 1976 ) . indeed ,",
    "its primordial abundance is the best tracer of the baryonic density parameter of the universe @xmath7 , and the decrease of its abundance during the galactic evolution should trace the amount of star formation ( among other astrophysical interests ) .    in the galactic ism , d / h measurements made toward hot stars have suggested variations  : imaps observations toward @xmath8  ori led to a low value ( jenkins _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) , confirming the previous analysis by laurent _",
    "et al . _ ( 1979 ) from _ copernicus _ observations , while toward @xmath9  vel they led to a high value ( sonneborn _ et al . _  2000",
    "this seems to indicate that in the ism , within few hundred parsecs , d / h may vary by more than a factor @xmath10 .",
    "in the nearby ism , the case of g191b2b was studied in detail ( see the most recent analysis by lemoine _ et  al .",
    "_ 2002 ) and the evaluation toward capella ( linsky _ et  al .",
    "_ 1995 ) taken as a reference .",
    "their comparison provided , for a while , a possible case for d / h variations within the local ism .",
    "concerning g191b2b , lemoine _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that the total @xmath11(h@xmath0i ) column density evaluation was greatly perturbed by the possible addition of two broad and weak h@xmath0i components .",
    "such components , able to mimic the shape of the lyman  @xmath12  damping wings , can induce an important decrease of the evaluated @xmath11(h@xmath0i ) . to illustrate this point , the error bar estimation on @xmath11(h@xmath0i ) from all previously published studies considered as the extremes of a 2@xmath4  limit was of the order of dex  0.07 , while including the lemoine _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 2002 ) analysis enlarged the error bar to about dex  0.37 .",
    "this huge change has , of course , a considerable impact on any d / h evaluation .",
    "this raises two crucial questions .",
    "first , is that situation typical of g191b2b alone and possibly due to an unexpected shape of the core of the stellar lyman  @xmath12  profile improperly described by the theoretical models ?",
    "second , if weak h@xmath0i features are present in the ism , to what extent are evaluations toward other targets affected ?",
    "from the combination of _ stis _ echelle observations ( spectrograph on board the hubble space telescope , hst ) and _ fuse _ ones ( the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer , moos _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) , lemoine _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) have found through iterative fitting process ( with the owens.f fitting program developed by martin lemoine and the french fuse team ) that three interstellar absorption components are present along the line of sight and that two additional broad and weak h@xmath0i components could be added , detected only over the lyman  @xmath12 line ( negligible over the lyman  @xmath13  line ) but important enough to strongly perturb the total h@xmath0i column density evaluation .    within the local ism , it has been shown that such additional hi absorptions are often present  ; they have been interpreted either as cloud interfaces with the hot gas within the local ism ( bertin _ et al _ 1995 ) or as `` hydrogen walls '' , signature of the shock interaction between the solar wind ( or stellar wind ) and the surrounding ism ( linsky , 1998 ) .",
    "this latter heliospheric absorption has been modeled by wood _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) and a prediction derived in the direction of g191b2b ( see figure 9 of lemoine _ et al . _ 2002 ) .",
    "most of the predicted absorption is expected in the saturated core of the observed interstellar line but some weak absorption ( @xmath14  of the continuum ) might extend over several tenths of angstroms on the red side of the line , due to the neutral hydrogen atoms seen behind the shock in the downwind direction where g191b2b is located .",
    "it was found that the combination of two broad and weak hi components can easily reproduce the model prediction . if real , besides the three interstellar absorptions , a fourth component representing the bulk of the predicted absorption and a fifth one for the broad and shallow extended red wing are needed .",
    "this is exactly what lemoine _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) have found .    in the course of determining the minimum number of components",
    "( each defined by its hi column density @xmath1 , its velocity @xmath15 , its temperature @xmath16 and turbulence broadening @xmath17 ) needed to fit the data , lemoine _ et al . _ ( 2002 ) completed the @xmath18test which uses the fisher - snedecor law describing the probability distribution of @xmath3 ratio .",
    "what is tested is the probability that the decrease of the @xmath3 with additional components is not simply due to the increase of free parameters .",
    "the result gives a probability @xmath19 and @xmath20 that a fourth and a fifth hi component are respectively not required by the data .",
    "these low probabilities of non occurence strongly suggest that lemoine _",
    "( 2002 ) have indeed detected the heliospheric absorption downwind in the direction of g191b2b .",
    "note however that this heliospheric complex absorption profile is simulated by two components whose physical meaning in terms of hydrogen content and/or temperature is not clear .",
    "furthermore , the photospheric lyman  @xmath12  stellar core is difficult to evaluate ( see discussion in e.g. lemoine _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) and is slightly red - shifted relative to the ism absorptions  ; this result may very well be simply related to the use of a white dwarf as background target star .",
    "the detailed analysis of the capella line of sight could directly test the heliospheric hypothesis .",
    "if the two additional components present along the g191b2b line of sight are as a matter of fact due to an heliospheric phenomenon , it is an extremely local signature ( within few hundreds of astronomical units to be compared to the few tens of parsecs lines of sight lengths ) which should be also present along the capella sight - line , both stars being separated by only @xmath21 on the sky , and similar in shape to the structure predicted and observed in the direction of g191b2b .",
    "if that description is correct , we are expecting an extra absorption reasonably represented by two additional components , a main one mostly lost within the ism absorption core and a weak one extending over several tenths of angstroms on the red side of the line , again due to the neutral hydrogen atoms seen behind the shock in the downwind direction where both g191b2b and capella are located .",
    "recently , young _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) analysed new obervations obtained at lyman  @xmath13 , lyman  @xmath22  and the whole lyman series with _",
    "fuse_. the precise lyman  @xmath12  stellar profile compatible with all lyman lines and with the data sets obtained at different phases of the capella binary system ( see also linsky _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) was reevaluated ( wood , 2001 ) and is used here as a reference profile , s@xmath23 .",
    "we thus revisited the fits completed over the lyman  @xmath12  line as observed toward capella with the best available data set , i.e. the one obtained with the _ ghrs _ ( the goddard high resolution spectrograph on board _ hst _ ) .",
    "the study by linsky _",
    "( 1995 ) , essentially confirmed by vidal ",
    "( 1998 ) , shows that only one interstellar component ( the local interstellar cloud , lic , also seen toward g191b2b ) is needed on that line of sight .",
    "this very simple structure strengthens the capella case as the simplest one where d / h can be very well evaluated . however , vidal  madjar _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) have already noted that an additional weak and broad hi component was required to better reproduce the profile  ; this was a first indication of the presence of an heliospheric absorption toward capella .",
    "in fact , we were able to show that , as in the case of g191b2b , the addition of one or two weak and broad hi components ( together with the very weak geocoronal component present at a known velocity but not shown on figure  [ cap - contvar ] for clarity ) improves the @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely we fitted the ghrs data assuming that the stellar continuum was s@xmath23 . adding successively to the fit one then two free hi components ( the added hi components have only three free parameters , velocity @xmath15 , column density @xmath1 and width * t * , since the thermal @xmath16 or turbulent broadening @xmath17 act in an undifferentiated manner when only one species is observed ) we obtained the following @xmath3/degree of freedom(d.o.f . )",
    "values  : for only the lic component and the geocorona , 844.89/716  ; for one additional component , 831.17/713  ; for two additional components , 822.68/710 .",
    "the @xmath18test probabilities that these two additional components are not required by the data are respectively @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the first one is clearly needed here ( its correlated parameter ranges according to different possible solutions similar in terms of @xmath3  are  : @xmath26  @xmath15  ( km  s@xmath27 )  @xmath28  ; @xmath29  @xmath1  ( @xmath30 )  @xmath31  ; @xmath32  * t *  ( k )  @xmath33 ) but unlike in the case of g191b2b , the second one corresponding to the weaker and broader one ( parameter ranges are  : @xmath34  @xmath15  ( km  s@xmath27 )  @xmath35  ; @xmath36  @xmath1  ( @xmath30 )  @xmath37  ; @xmath38  * t *  ( k )  @xmath39 ) is less strongly needed .",
    "these ranges are certainly compatible with the corresponding estimated values in the direction of g191b2b ( see figure 10 of lemoine _ et al . _ 2002 ) .    to search for the possible impact of the choice of the continuum on the evaluation of @xmath1(hi ) , we fixed this value and looked for the best fitted solutions while the stellar continuum we used s@xmath23  was allowed for some variations by multiplying it by a low order polynomial ( 8@xmath40  order ) which coefficients were free to vary along with all components parameters .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ cap - contvar ] .",
    "slight changes of the continuum shape by no more than @xmath41  lead to nearly identical @xmath3  values , with @xmath1(hi ) varying from @xmath42 to @xmath43 which corresponds to a change in d / h from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "this is clearly a larger range ( @xmath46 ) than the one previously claimed ( @xmath47 , linsky _ et al .",
    ".    the situation could be even worse since we do not know how far the capella continuum could be away from s@xmath23 .",
    "the question is thus to evaluate if the capella lyman  @xmath12  stellar continuum shape is estimated to better than @xmath41  or not  ?",
    "it is true that having a binary system can help constraining the continuum shape as linsky _",
    "( 1995 ) did , but their whole approach requires that the lyman  @xmath12  stellar profiles of both g1  iii and g8  iii stars are invariant with phase and time .",
    "in fact , from the study of 120 _ iue _ echelle spectra , ayres _",
    "( 1993 ) have shown on one hand that the line fluxes were surprisingly stable , but on the other hand that whichever way they process the data , obvious variations were seen .",
    "these seem to be related to variations of the blue peak of the g1  iii dominant stellar lyman  @xmath12  line .",
    "they found that in the 19811986 interval , the line shape at phase 0.25 of the system was quite stable and similar to the one recorded with the _ ghrs _ in 1991 ( at a @xmath41 level ) .",
    "earlier spectra taken in 1980 or later ones observed after 1986 look quite different .",
    "this very careful study shows that with the _ iue _ sensitivity level of @xmath48 , variations are clearly detected . since linsky _",
    "( 1995 ) used _ ghrs _ observations at two different phases of the system ( 0.26 and 0.80 ) taken respectively in april 1991 and in september 1993 , i.e. two and a half year apart , it is difficult to ascertain that the lyman  @xmath12  profile evaluated for each stellar component is well controlled . because of the very careful analysis made by linsky _",
    "( 1995 ) , it may be possible that the stellar lyman  @xmath12   profiles are relatively well evaluated but certainly not at a level better than @xmath41  as previously mentioned .",
    "thus , an heliospheric absorption is also detected on the capella sight ",
    "line  ; furthermore , even in such a simple ism configuration ( a unique component ) , it appears impossible to tightly constrain the total hi column density in that direction .",
    "we have shown that , for two lines of sight , @xmath1(hi ) can not be evaluated with a high accuracy .",
    "column densities on both sight  lines are very similar , of the order of few times @xmath49 . for lower column densities ,",
    "the situation should be worse since then the possible absorption signature of the weak components is becoming relatively more and more important and the lyman  @xmath12   line is getting closer to the flat part of the curve of growth where column densities are indeed difficult to evaluate .",
    "note however that the hst / euve comparison completed by linsky _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) shows that often @xmath1(hi ) values derived from the ghrs and euve data ( not sensitive to weak hi ) are in good agreement , implying that heliospheric absorption ( or other hot components ) do nt necessarily ruin lyman - alpha analyses in a dramatic way . but clearly counter examples leave that question open due to possible systematics related to the evaluation of total hi below the lyman limit in the euve domain .    on the contrary",
    ", one could guess that for larger column densities the situation should improve since the lyman  @xmath12  damping wings are becoming broader and the signature of the weak features may disapear in the line core . just above @xmath5",
    ", the reliability of the d / h values is greatly enhanced if the studied gas is demonstrably warm ( 6000 k  ; for a thorough discussion see york , 2001 )  ; as one goes above @xmath6 , credibility increases unless either cold gas components are hidden in the warm di but still affect the hi damping wings or weak hi features at high velocity are present .",
    "the unknown referee further stressed this point through an impressive report .",
    "he mentionned that at @xmath1(hi)=@xmath50 , the half - intensity point of pure damping lyman  @xmath12  and lyman  @xmath13  profiles , located respectively at velocity shifts of 274  km  s@xmath27  and 55  km  s@xmath27 , should be the place where a putative high - velocity feature could have a strong perturbing influence on the damping profile .",
    "however only very few high velocity ism components were detected above 120  km  s@xmath27 .",
    "this could lead to the inverse impression that for larger column densities , the estimation through the lyman  @xmath13  line should be more questionable than the one made at lyman  @xmath12 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "in both the @xmath22  cas and @xmath51  pup lines of sight , the hi column density was discrepant when derived through the lyman  @xmath12  or the lyman  @xmath13  line ( see below ) .",
    "however in both cases the lyman  @xmath13   estimations of @xmath1(hi ) are smaller , in contradiction with the formerly suggested cause since the most perturbed evaluation by additional absorptions should lead instead to larger column densities .",
    "high velocity ism components essentially observed below 120  km  s@xmath27were only searched for through other lines and species than hi at lyman  @xmath12 the strongest transition of the most abundant element .",
    "for instance , cowie _ et al . _ ( 1979 )",
    "reported lyman  @xmath8  and lyman  @xmath52  hi",
    "ism absorptions up to about 105 km / s for @xmath53  ori . from their study",
    ", the referee evaluated that a shock at 274  km  s@xmath27   should produce either a very broad ( @xmath54  km  s@xmath27 ) and undetectable ( maximum depth of @xmath55 ) post - shock absorption signature or should originate in a region far downstream from the front where the gas has cooled and compressed enough to allow recombination of the h atoms , i.e. a shock from a supernova explosion entering the radiative phase . in this second case however , he estimated from cowie and york ( 1978 ) and spitzer ( 1978 ) that such signatures should occur only very near a known supernova event , i.e. within about 30 to 60 pc for standard ism and sn values .",
    "thus , that looks unlikely too .    on the other hand ,",
    "high - velocity gas could be generated by the target stars .",
    "while gry , lamers and vidal  madjar ( 1984 ) seem to detect most of the activity at velocities below 100 km / s , they nevertheless identified a transient component at -150 km / s toward @xmath9  vel through lyman  @xmath8  and another one at -220 km / s toward @xmath53  ori , through lyman  @xmath52 .",
    "note also that this survey was completed over a limited spectral domain scanned with the copernicus instrument , and not at lyman  @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ with a relatively limited sensitivity .",
    "one might argue that there are some risks that stellar ejecta could influence the lyman  @xmath12  measurements  ; but the observers have a good defense  : multiple observations at very different epochs .",
    "this strategy was invoked by jenkins _",
    "( 1999 ) and sonneborn _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) in their studies of d / h toward @xmath8  ori , @xmath51  pup and @xmath9  vel .",
    "their findings are thus pretty convincing in this regard",
    ".    all the above stated arguments should mitigate our concern that small amounts of hi at high velocities are a likely source of confusion for the flanks of the damping profiles for @xmath1(hi ) of the order of or greater than @xmath56  @xmath30 .",
    "one however should recall the two lines of sight for which the hi column density was discrepant when derived through the lyman  @xmath12  or the lyman  @xmath13  line  :    * @xmath22  cas + in bohlin , savage and drake ( 1978 ) , lyman  @xmath12  only ( _ copernicus _ ) @xmath1(hi )  =  @xmath57 + in ferlet _",
    "et al . _ ( 1980 ) , core of lyman  @xmath13  only ( _ copernicus _ ) @xmath1(hi )  =  @xmath58 + in diplas and savage ( 1994 ) , from lyman  @xmath12  only ( _ iue _ ) @xmath1(hi )  =  @xmath59 * @xmath51  pup + in bohlin ( 1975 ) from lyman  @xmath12  only ( _ copernicus _ ) @xmath1(hi )  =  @xmath60 + in vidal  madjar _",
    "et al . _ ( 1977 ) , from lyman  @xmath13  only ( _ copernicus _ ) @xmath1(hi )  =  @xmath61 + in diplas and savage ( 1994 ) , from lyman  @xmath12  only ( _ iue _ ) @xmath1(hi )  =  @xmath62 + in sonneborn _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) , from lyman  @xmath12  only ( _ iue _ ) @xmath1(hi )  =  @xmath63    since lyman  @xmath13  is less sensitive to weak hi features , it is interesting to note that in both cases the lyman  @xmath13  evaluation is slightly below the lyman  @xmath12  one , a possible indication of a similar effect for column densities of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "note however that these two cases are marginally convincing since the different evaluations are still compatible within the error bars .",
    "therefore , if this effect is indeed real for relatively large column densities , it means that some of the d / h values may be underestimated and thus the higher d / h ratios may be favoured .",
    "this further shows the importance of the @xmath64  vel estimation ( sonneborn _ et al .",
    "according to our conclusion that there is lower precision for @xmath1(hi ) measurements within the local ism , i.e. at low column densities , which induces large error bars on the corresponding d / h estimations : +    * the @xmath1(hi ) evaluation in the direction of capella is relatively less accurate than previously claimed and is of the order of log  @xmath1(hi )  @xmath65 leading to d / h  @xmath66  ; * an average d / h ratio may exist in the local ism but should be larger than previously evaluated since locally @xmath1(hi ) could be overestimated by as much as about 20%  ; this does affect arguments about local variability  ; * d / o should be a better tracer of d variations as originally suggested by timmes _",

    "2002  ; hbrard _ et al .",
    "_ 2002a , 2002b ) and further confirmed by the stability of o / h over longer path length ( meyer _ et al . _",
    "1998  ; andr _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) , provided all sources of errors related to the oxygen measurements are well understood .",
    "finally , we note also that a similar systematic effect has been pointed out by pettini and bowen ( 2001 ) for the evaluation of d / h in quasars absorption line systems .",
    "again as in our study , the systems presenting the highest values of @xmath1(hi ) are derived from the damping wings of the lyman  @xmath12  line , which also includes all hi in close proximity of the hydrogen at the line center of deuterium ( burles , 2001 ) , while those for which @xmath1(hi ) is evaluated from the discontinuity at the lyman limit present smaller column densities and larger d / h evaluations .",
