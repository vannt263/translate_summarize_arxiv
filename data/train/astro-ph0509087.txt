    "the understanding of the origin and star formation history of the stellar system @xmath0 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) , the most massive and luminous globular cluster of the milky way ( @xmath3 , merrit et al .",
    "1997 ) , represents one of the most intriguing brain teasers of stellar astrophysics .",
    "the observational evidences collected over the last 40 years indicates that @xmath0 cen is the most peculiar object among galactic star clusters in terms of structure , kinematics and stellar content .",
    "it is the only known globular cluster which shows a clear metallicity spread . in the last ten years",
    ", extensive spectroscopic surveys have been performed on large samples of giant stars ( norris , freeman & mighell 1996 , suntzeff & kraft 1996 , hereafter nfm96 and sk96 respectively ) , showing a multimodal distribution of heavy - element .",
    "recent photometric surveys have revealed the presence of several anomalous sequences in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . in particular , wide - field photometric studies ( lee et al . 1999 , pancino et al .",
    "hereafter p00 ) have shown the presence of an additional anomalous red giant branch ( hereafter rgb - a ) . according to p00 ,",
    "this population contains approximately 5% of the cluster s stellar content and represents the extreme metal - rich end of the metallicity distribution .",
    "moreover , the metal - rich giants appear to have different spatial distribution and dynamical behaviour with respect to the metal poor ones ( norris et al .",
    "1997 , jurcsik 1998 , pancino et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 , sollima et al .",
    "2005a ) . beside the dominant population ( having metallicity @xmath4 \\sim -1.6 $ ] ) and the rgb - a ( @xmath4 \\sim -0.6 $ ] ) , three metal - intermediate ( mints ) components ( with @xmath5 <",
    "-1.0 $ ] ) have been identified by sollima et al .",
    "( 2005a , hereafter s05 ) .",
    "more recently , a high - precision photometric survey in the central region of the cluster ( ferraro et al . 2004 , hereafter f04 ) revealed the presence of a narrow well defined sub giant branch ( sgb - a ) which merges into the main sequence ( ms ) of the dominant cluster population at a magnitude significantly fainter than the cluster turn - off ( to ) .",
    "although this feature seems to be the extension of the rgb - a , a direct comparison of the ms - to morphology with theoretical isochrones shows that the anomalous metal - rich population can not be significantly younger than the most metal - poor one .",
    "this interpretation leads to inconsistences with the self - enrichment scenario proposed for @xmath0 cen ( freeman 1993 , lee et al .",
    "1999 , bekki & freeman 2003 ) . finally , anderson ( 2002 ) and",
    "bedin et al . (",
    "2004 ) discovered new peculiarities also along the ms of the cluster .",
    "in fact , an additional less populous blue main sequence ( bms , comprising @xmath1 30% of the whole cluster ms stars ) located parallel to the dominant one , has been evidenced . according to stellar models with canonical chemical abundances ,",
    "the location of the observed bms would suggest a lower metallicity .",
    "conversely , piotto et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter p05 ) presented the spectroscopical analysis of 34 ms stars belonging to the two ms components showing that the bms stars present a metallicity @xmath6 higher than the dominant cluster population .",
    "this evidence brought p05 to conclude that only a large helium enhancement could explain the anomalous position of the bms in the cmd , as suggested by norris ( 2004 , hereafter n04 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "until now , only rough estimates of the relative ages of @xmath0 cen have been made , using broad and narrow band photometry ( hilker & richtler 2000 , rey et al .",
    "2004 , hughes et al .",
    "these studies suggested a time scale of chemical enrichment up to 6 gyr . a smaller age spread ( @xmath1 2 gyr ) has been estimated by n04 , hilker et al .",

    "as part of a long term project devoted to the detailed study of the properties of different stellar populations in this cluster ( see ferraro et al . 2003 ) , we present low - resolution spectroscopy of 256 sgb stars of @xmath0 cen .",
    "we derived metal content and radial velocities for the different sub - populations of the cluster . using these estimates",

    "observations were performed during two runs on may 2003 , as a part of the ital - flames guaranteed time observations ( gto ) , and on february 2005 at the vlt / ut2 at eso ( cerro paranal , chile ) equiped with the multi - fiber spectrograph flames / medusa ( pasquini et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "we used the low resolution grating lr8 , which allows a spectral coverage of 1200  (between 8200 - 9400   ) with a resolving power of @xmath9 .",
    "the spectra were obtained combining three 2085 s long exposures secured in good seeing conditions ( @xmath10 ) , reaching an average signal to noise ratio of @xmath11 per pixel .",
    "we observed two samples of data : _",

    "the one - dimensional spectra were extracted with the giraffe pipeline .",
    "16 fibers were dedicated to sky observations in each exposure . an average sky spectrum was obtained and subtracted from the object spectra , by taking into account the different fiber transmission .",

    "spectra of two program stars are shown in fig .",

    "the determination of equivalent widths ( ews ) and radial velocities was performed on the basis of infrared ca ii triplet lines strength , following the prescriptions of rutledge et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter r97 ) .      in order to determine radial velocities , we cross correlated the spectra of our sample with a high signal to noise ( @xmath12 ) rgb template spectrum ( roa 371 , see pancino et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter p02 ) .",
    "all spectra were corrected for heliocentric velocity .",
    "the correlation function @xmath13 between the program spectra @xmath14 and the template spectrum @xmath15 was calculated as follows @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 for a large range of @xmath19 values ( @xmath2010 ) .",
    "the correlation function @xmath13 was then fit with a gaussian function whose center provided the velocity estimate .",
    "this procedure was performed independently on each single exposure and the root mean square ( rms ) computed from the mean was assumed as the velocity error .",
    "the final @xmath21 estimate was used to doppler - shift the spectra at the wavelength corresponding to @xmath22 , so that the band windows used to calculate the ews were properly aligned .",
    "all stars with radial velocity different from the mean cluster velocity by more than @xmath23 were considered field stars . adopting this criterion ,",
    "256 out of a total of 280 stars were retained as bona fide cluster members .",
    "we measured the ew of three ca ii lines and defined an _ equivalent line strength index _ ( @xmath24 ) according to r97 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the ews of the caii lines at @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the measurement of the ew of each ca ii line was done by linearly interpolating the average intensities in two continuum bands on each side of the feature .",
    "the ew was the integral over the line band of the difference between the continuum and the line .",
    "the band limits used to define the continuum and the feature regions are listed in table 1 .",
    "the line profile was modeled with a moffat function of exponent 2.5 as indicated by r97 . for each program star ,",
    "the three exposures were averaged in order to obtain a higher signal to noise spectrum .",
    "the index measurement was performed independently on each single exposure and on the averaged spectrum .",
    "we adopted the @xmath24 index derived from the averaged spectrum as reference , and the rms computed from the three exposures has been assumed as @xmath24 error .    in all previous ca ii triplet analysis performed on globular cluster rgb stars",
    ", the obtained @xmath24 indices were converted into `` reduced '' ew using an empirical linear relation linking the @xmath24 index with the v magnitude difference between the program star and the horizontal branch ( hb ) of the cluster ( armandroff & da costa 1991 , da costa & armandroff 1995 , geisler 1995 , r97 , cole et al .",
    "this correction removes the gravity effect on ew that , for giant stars , increases approximately linearly with magnitude , with a negligible dependence on temperature ( idiart et al .",
    "1997 ) . unfortunately , as gravity increases",
    ", this approximation holds no more ( sk96 , cenarro et al . 2001 ",
    "hereafter c01 ) .",
    "for this reason we decided to re - calibrate the relation linking @xmath24 with metallicity , using the most extensive catalog of observed spectra available in the literature by c01 .",
    "a detailed description of the calibration procedure is provided in appendix  a.",
    "fig . [ histo ] shows the metallicity distribution obtained for the 152 member stars belonging to the @xmath28 .",
    "a sharp and asymmetric peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath1  1.7 can be seen , with a long tail extending toward higher metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath29 ) , in agreement with the previous spectroscopical determinations by nfm96 and sk96 .",
    "care must be taken when comparing the metallicity distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ histo ] with those obtained by nfm96 and sk96 , since the present analysis is based on a _ biased _ sample , formed by targets selected along the different sgbs of @xmath0 cen .",
    "nevertheless , the global shape of the distribution in fig . [ histo ] , is consistent with those showed by nfm96 and sk96 .",
    "a more detailed insight on the metal - rich populations of @xmath0  cen can be achieved by observing the average metallicity of stars belonging to the different branches in the @xmath30 ( see fig . [ hiacs ] ) .",
    "it is worthy of notice that stars selected along different branches in the cmd are confirmed to belong to different metallicity groups . in particular ,",
    "stars standing on the two brightest sgbs have a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath1  1.7 and [ fe / h]@xmath1  1.4 respectively , in full agreement with the results obtained using the @xmath28 .",
    "stars located on the two faintest sgbs have an average metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.1 and [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -0.6 , respectively . by comparing the obtained metallicities with the metallicity groups identified on the rgb of @xmath0 cen by s05 , we can associate the dominant metal - poor group ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.7 ) to the rgb - mp population and the secondary metal - rich one ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.4 ) to the rgb - mint2 population .",
    "concerning the group of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.1 , s05 found a bulk of rgb stars with similar metallicity . a direct comparison with the existing high - resolution spectroscopical analysis on rgb stars in @xmath0  cen confirms the presence of a number of stars with metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.0 ( norris & da costa 1995 , vanture et al .",
    "2002 , p02 , pancino 2003 ) . given its metal content , we can therefore associate this population of sgb stars to the rgb - mint3 population , as defined by s05 .",
    "sgb - a stars , located on the faintest sgb , have a significantly higher metallicity ( @xmath1 1 dex ) with respect to the bulk population , representing the extreme metal - rich extension of the stellar content of @xmath0 cen , fully consistent with the measures obtained by p02 for rgb - a stars . _",
    "this result represents the first direct confirmation that the rgb - a and the sgb - a sequences belong to the same population_. for clarity , in the following we will adopt for the different populations the naming convention defined by s05 .",
    "the adopted metallicities for the observed populations of @xmath0 cen are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the sgb - to is the most sensitive region of the cmd to the age of a stellar population .",
    "once the metal content of each sgb population has been measured , we should be able to derive relative ages for each population through an appropriate comparison with theoretical isochrones .",
    "we used a set of theoretical isochrones calculated adopting the most up - to - date input physics ( straniero , chieffi & limongi 1997 ) .",
    "in particular , the equation of state includes the electrostatic correction ( see prada moroni & straniero 2002 ) and microscopic diffusion ( gravitational settling and thermal diffusion ) .",
    "the theoretical isochrones have beed transformed into the observational planes by means of the synthesis code described in origlia & leitherer ( 2000 ) and using the model atmospheres by bessel , castelli & plez ( 1998 , hereafter bcp98 ) .",
    "for the acs data set , the filter responses and camera throughputs , kindly provided by the acs user support team , have been used .    to compare the observed sgbs with theoretical isochrones , we need to assume a distance modulus and a reddening correction . in the following we",
    "adopt the distance modulus by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath31 .",
    "concerning the reddening and extinction coefficients , we assumed @xmath32 ( lub 2002 ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( savage & mathis 1979 ) and @xmath35 ( dean , warren & cousins 1978 ) .",
    "although the evolution of a star along the sgb depends mainly on age and metallicity , other factors may have a non negligible impact , namely the @xmath36-elements and helium abundance .",
    "straniero & chieffi ( 1991 ) and salaris , chieffi & straniero ( 1993 ) showed that , when computing the isochrones of population ii stars , the contribution of the @xmath36-element enhancement can be taken into account by simply rescaling standard models to the global metallicity [ m / h ] , according to the following relation    @xmath37 = [ fe / h ] + log ( 0.638~\\times~10^{[\\alpha / fe ] } + 0.362)\\ ] ]    the corresponding metallicity , in terms of mass fraction z , is    @xmath38+log[z / x]_\\odot}}{1 + 10^{[m / h]+log[z / x]_\\odot}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39_\\odot = 0.0176 $ ] , according to allende prieto et al .",

    "2003 ) .    regarding the helium abundance , several authors considered the effects of differences in helium abundance among the different populations of @xmath0 cen ( f04 , bedin et al .",
    "2004 , dantona & caloi 2004 , n04 , p05 , lee et al .",
    "in particular , n04 ad lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested a helium enhancement of @xmath41 for the mint population and @xmath42 for the most metal - rich anomalous one , in order to reproduce the complex ms morphology of @xmath0 cen .",
    "although such high helium enhancements would imply a series of problems , concerning the helium yields for low - mass stellar systems ( see  6 ) , we explored this possibility for the mints and sgb - a populations by fitting the observed sgbs with models having canonical he abundance and various he - enhancement levels .",
    "the adopted metallicity , @xmath43 $ ] , y and the derived age for each population of @xmath0 cen are summarized in table  2 .",
    "[ to ] and [ toacs ] show the isochrone fitting for the observed populations of @xmath0 cen for the @xmath28 and the @xmath30 respectively , assuming for each population different helium abundances ranging from the cosmological value y=0.246 ( salaris et al .",
    "2004 ; cyburt et al .",
    "2003 ) up to y=0.40 .",
    "regarding the @xmath28 , in order to perform a meaningful comparison and to avoid spurious contamination from stars with uncertain metallicity measurement , we considered only stars with [ fe / h]@xmath44 ( sgb - mp population ) and @xmath45[fe / h]@xmath46 ( sgb - mint2 population ) .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ to ] , apart from the presence of few outliers ( probably due to spectroscopic and/or photometric errors ) , there is a clear segregation between the two samples . while most of the sgb - mp stars populate the brighter portion of the sgb , sgb - mint2 stars appear to be mainly located in the fainter part of the sgb .",
    "the two groups of stars are fit by theoretical isochrones of the same age ( 16 gyr ) and appropriate metallicity ( see  4.1 ) . in fig .",
    "[ to]b an isochrone with a significant helium enhancement ( y=0.35 ) is also overplotted .",
    "as can be seen , the location of the target stars is nicely reproduced by this isochrone .",
    "the same procedure has been followed for the @xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "[ toacs ] ) . also in this case a set of 16 gyr old isochrones with appropriate metallicities and different helium enhancements",
    "are overplotted . as can be noted ,",
    "the adoption of a different helium abundance yields a better fit of the sgb shape but does not significantly affect the relative ages . note that all the populations are nicely reproduced by isochrones with the same age . in order to further support this result , we plotted the four isochrones with the best choice of helium abundance , as derived from the comparison shown in fig .",
    "[ to]b and [ toacs ] , and various ages in fig .",
    "as can be seen , a change of @xmath47 in the adopted age produces a significant variation in the isochrone location .",
    "hence , the average error in the age differences , estimated on the basis of the effects produced on the estimated age by the intrinsic magnitude spread of the observed sgbs , can be assumed to be @xmath48 .",
    "summarizing , we reproduced all the four considered populations with 16  gyr old isochrones .",
    "the adopted he abundances are : the cosmological y=0.246 for the sgb - mp population , y=0.35 for the sgb - mint2 population , y=0.35 for the sgb - mint3 population and y=0.40 for the sgb - a population .",
    "we found that a large helium enhancement affects the morphology of the sgb but does not change its average magnitude .",
    "in particular , increasing the helium abundance :    * the slope of the sgb becomes steeper ; * the color difference between the to and the rgb base decreases .",
    "_ as a consequence , the assumption of a differential helium abundance among the different populations of @xmath0 cen allows a better fit of the observed sgb morphology but does not significantly affect the relative ages_.    note that although the old zero point of the adopted age scale differs from the most recent determinations of the age of the universe ( cyburt et al .",
    "2003 ) , the age differences are marginally affected by this assumption .    in fig .",
    "[ cmd ] the four isochrones are overplotted to the entire acs cmd of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the isochrones correctly reproduce the global shape of the observed sequences from the ms up to the rgb .",
    "however , is worth of noticing that :    _ ( i ) _ our best - fit isochrone for the mint2 population , having y=0.35 , does not cross the mp isochrone at the ms level . if we accept the hypotesis that the mint2 population is related to the blue ms observed by bedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we need to adopt a larger helium abundance ( @xmath49 ) in agreement with what found by n04 , p05 and lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    _",
    "( ii ) _ together with isochrones , the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) of the mp and mint2 populations are plotted on the cmd .",
    "we used the latest models computed using franec ( see straniero , chieffi & limongi 1997 for details ) .. the core masses and the surface compositions were derived from the corresponding last models in the h - burning shell .",
    "the zahb model was set when all the secondary elements in their h - burning shell are relaxed to their equilibrium values .",
    "] as can be immediately noted , the zahb corresponding to the mint2 population is significantly brighter than the observed hb .",
    "this is a consequence of the large helium abundance assumed for this population , that strongly increases the cno cycle efficiency in the hb stars envelopes and leads to a stable equilibrium stage at higher luminosity .",
    "butler et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and rey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a group of rr lyrae variables with metallicity significantly higher than that of the dominant cluster population located @xmath50 below the average rr lyrae v magnitude .",
    "if we associate the metal - rich rr lyrae to the mint2 population , the assumption of a significant increase in the he abundance would produce a stark incongruence with the observed luminosity of such metal - rich rr lyrae .",
    "similar incongruences between the expected and the observed luminosity of metal - rich rr lyrae stars have been noted by n04 and sollima et al .",
    "( 2005b in preparation ) . in this respect , note that most of the helium - rich hb stars reach higher temperatures because of their smaller masses , and therefore populate essentially the blue tail of the hb , a region where magnitude differences can not be appreciated ( p05 , lee et al .",
    "hence , only few helium - rich stars are expected to cross the instability strip .",
    "another intriguing characteristic of @xmath0 cen is the observed connection between kinematics and abundances . from ca ii triplet analysis of about 400 rgb stars , norris et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter n97 ) found that the 20% metal - rich tail of the metallicity distribution is kinematically cooler than the 80% metal poor component . beside this result , n97 found that their metal - rich component does not show the same systemic rotation as the metal - poor one .",
    "this last finding appears in contradiction to a simple dissipative scenario .",

    "a surprising result concerns the behaviour of the velocity dispersion as a function of metallicity . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ vel]b , for stars with @xmath54<~-1.0 $ ] , the velocity dispersion decreases as the metal abundance increases , in agreement with the result by n97 .",
    "sgb - a stars do not follow this trend : they show a significantly larger velocity dispersion and seem to be kinematically warmer than the mint stars .",
    "this evidence is confirmed even if we consider only stars lying in the inner @xmath55 , and seems to be independent on the distance to the cluster center .",
    "although the sample used by n97 spans a metallicity range similar to that covered by the present analysis ( -1.6 @xmath56~<$ ] 0.0 ) , it contains only a few stars at [ ca / h ] @xmath57 -0.7 . for this reason , while at metallicity @xmath58~ < -1.0 $ ] the trend observed by n97 is fully confirmed by our analysis , the peculiar kinematical behaviour of sgb - a stars could not be detected by n97 .",
    "summarizing , the mint populations are the only cool components , being kinematically cooler than both the ( hot ) mp population and the ( warm ) sgb - a .",
    "the observed behaviour of the kinematical properties of @xmath0  cen as a function of its metallicity is still far from being fully understood .",
    "the warm velocity dispersion of the sgb - a stars adds up to other structural and kinematical peculiarities of the rgb - a stars .",
    "first , the rgb - a centroid in the spatial density distribution appears significantly dislocated from the main population s one ( pancino et al .",
    "2003 , s05 ) .",
    "moreover , the mean proper motion of rgb - a stars differs significantly from that of the main cluster population ( ferraro et al .",
    "this last result has been questioned by platais et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who claimed that the different proper motion observed for rgb - a stars is due to a spurious instrumental effect in the original proper motion catalog by van leuween et al .",

    "we presented low - resolution spectroscopy of 256 sgb stars in @xmath0 cen .",
    "metallicities and radial velocities have been measured from ca ii triplet lines analysis .",
    "the metallicity distribution function confirms the metallicity spread observed in previous analysis performed on giant stars .",
    "sgb - a stars appear to have a metallicity higher than the bulk population , representing the extreme metal - rich extension of the stellar content of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the relative ages of the different stellar populations of the system have been estimated by fitting the observed sgbs with theoretical isochrones having appropriate metallicities and various helium content .",
    "the ages derived for the different populations are all compatible within 2 gyr .",
    "this result indicates that @xmath0 cen enriched itself in a short timescale ( @xmath59 ) and imposes firm constraints on the chemical evolution of the system .",
    "the hypotesis of a large helium gradient between the populations of @xmath0 cen has been tested .",
    "we found that the morphology of the sgb of the most metal rich populations of the cluster can be better reproduced assuming a helium enhancement , with respect to the dominant metal poor population , of @xmath60 for the mints population and @xmath61 for the anomalous one , in good agreement with previous estimates in literature .",
    "such large helium overabundances do not affect significantly the relative ages of the stellar populations .",
    "the results presented here exclude an extended star formation period , regardless of the adopted helium abundances .",
    "the average error in the age differences is @xmath62 ( see  4.2 ) , so age differences smaller than this quantity can not be appreciated .",
    "nevertheless , this finding imposes serious problems related to the chemical enrichment history of this stellar system .",
    "hilker & richtler ( 2000 ) claimed an extended star formation period in order to explain the tight correlation between cn - band strengths and iron abundances .",
    "moreover , the abundance patterns of s - process elements require the contribution of low - mass agb stars ( @xmath63 , smith et al .",
    "stars of these masses reach the agb phase after 0.7 - 1.5 gyr that should represent a lower limit for the age difference between the populations of @xmath0 cen .",
    "finally , in the hypotesis of a large helium enhancement , the derived helium abundance gradient between the mp and mint2 population turns out to be @xmath64 , in stark contrast with more canonical values of @xmath65 ( pagel et al .",
    "1992 , jimenez et al .",
    "an efficient he production driven by low - mass agb stars would be accomplished by a corresponding c overabundance , in contradiction with observational evidences ( smith et al .",
    "in the same way , intermediate mass stars would produce , beside he , an unusual n abundance .",
    "a larger helium yield is provided by more massive objects ( m @xmath66 ) wherein black hole production limits the amount of heavy elements relative to helium in the ejecta released into the interstellar medium ( timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the stellar populations of the cluster appear more puzzling than ever .",
    "the velocity dispersion as a function of metallicity shows a mimum at @xmath4 ~\\sim~ -1.1 $ ] , suggesting that mint populations are kinematically cooler than both the mp and the anomalous population .",
    "the emerging scenario can be summarized as follows :    \\i ) the mp population ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.7 ) represents the first and largest event of star formation of @xmath0 cen .",
    "it contains the majority of cluster s stars , and can be well reproduced by an old isochrone having a cosmological helium abundance .",
    "moreover , it presents the highest velocity dispersion among the different cluster populations .",
    "\\ii ) the mint2 population ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.3 ) could have had a peculiar history .",
    "it is suspected to be connected to the bms ( bedin et al .",
    "2004 , p05 ) , and for this reason it requires an anomalous helium overabundance ( y @xmath57 0.35 ) .",
    "this population formed after a short timescale ( @xmath67 2 gyr ) from a medium enriched by snii in iron and @xmath36-elements abundance , and by agb winds of massive stars in s - process elements and , possibly , helium ( see also the discussion in  4.2 ) .",
    "how a such huge amount of helium could have been produced remains at present an unanswered question .",
    "moreover , mint2 stars present a smaller velocity dispersion with respect to the bulk metal poor population ones , indicating an evolution in the dynamical settling of the system . the mint3 population ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1.0 ) , together with mint2 , represents the kinematically cool component .",
    "\\iii ) the anomalous population represents the metal - rich end of the stellar population mix of @xmath0 cen at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -0.6 .",
    "although increasing the helium abundance to y@xmath10.4 improves the fit of the sgb - a shape , no value of helium abundance can make this anomalous population significantly younger than the mp population .",
    "moreover , the analysis of radial velocities of these stars indicates a kinematical behaviour different from the mint populations . for these reasons ,",
    "the understanding of the origin and evolution of this population is still a mistery .",
    "two different scenarios can be put forward to explain its origin :    \\a ) a very fast self - enrichment process generated the anomalous population in the early stage of evolution of @xmath0 cen , producing a large amount of helium ( @xmath68 ) , s - process elements ( [ s / fe ] @xmath69 + 1.0 ) and iron ( leading to a lower [ @xmath36/fe]@xmath70 + 0.1 ) in less than 2 gyr .",
    "\\b ) the anomalous population evolved in a different environment and was later accreted by the main body of @xmath0  cen .",
    "freyhammer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that stars belonging to the sgb - a are physically separated from and more distant than the main body of @xmath0  cen by about 120 - 250 pc .",
    "to achieve their best fit under this hypothesis , however , the authors have to assume for the sgb - a a metallicity of 1.1@xmath67[fe / h]@xmath670.8 , in stark contrast with the present determination , and the abundance measured along the rgb - a ( [ fe / h]@xmath690.6@xmath200.15 , p02 and origlia et al .",
    "moreover , the few radial velocity determinations of rgb - a stars ( p02 , vanture et al . 2002 and origlia et al .",
    "2003 ) and the present large sample of sgb - a measurements suggest that the radial velocity of this population is not different from the @xmath0  cen systemic velocity , therefore implying that sgb - a stars and @xmath0  cen are at least dynamically bound to each other .",
    "the results presented in this paper confirm once more that a simple self - enrichment scenario can not explain all the observational evidences gathered in the past .",
    "many questions remain to be understood in order to explain the formation and evolution of this peculiar stellar system .",
    "therefore , it is clear that if one desires to accommodate all the observational facts in one self - consistent scenario , it is necessary to include not only a complex chemical evolution , but also a complex dynamical history .",
