    "in the hydrodynamic approximation , i.e. for long wavelengths , the propagation of sound waves in a moving fuid is analogous to that of light in a curved spacetime  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , a one dimensional flow defines the acoustic metric @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the flow velocity and @xmath2 the speed of sound . assuming that the fluid flows from right to left ( @xmath3 ) , a sonic horizon is present where @xmath4 crosses @xmath5",
    "this situation describes a black ( white ) hole horizon when @xmath6 evaluated at @xmath7 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "one thus expects that such system would emit a hawking flux , i.e. a thermal flux of phonons at a temperature given by @xmath8 ( in units where @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , since hawking radiation relies on short wavelength modes  @xcite , the dispersion of sound waves , which is neglected in the hydrodynamic approximation , must be taken into account . following the original work  @xcite ,",
    "this was done using analytical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite methods . provided the dispersive scale @xmath10 ,",
    "the `` healing length '' , is much smaller than the surface gravity scale @xmath11 , it was found that the thermal properties of the spectrum are extremely robust .",
    "in fact , so robust that it is very difficult to characterize and analyze the small deviations with respect to the standard flux .",
    "our aim is to complete the analysis of  @xcite where it was shown that the spectrum remains planckian whenever @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a critical frequency which scales as @xmath14 but , more importantly , also depends on @xmath15 , the asymptotic value of @xmath16 .",
    "since this result was obtained using symmetrical profiles like @xmath17 , one may wonder whether the robustness of the spectrum was not partially due to the symmetry of the flow w.r.t .",

    "the horizon ( dashed vertical line ) is shifted to @xmath25 . in the last two cases , there is no horizon : for @xmath26 ( dotted line ) , the flow is everywhere supersonic , and for @xmath27 ( dotdashed line ) , it is subsonic.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we consider elongated condensates , stationary flowing along the longitudinal direction @xmath28 .",

    "namely , spectra calculated with different values of @xmath10 almost coincide when @xmath46 is plotted versus the rescaled quantity @xmath73 . to identify the parameters governing the deviations from planckianity we define @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the actual energy flux and @xmath76 is the thermal flux at temperature @xmath49 . in fig .",

    "what we learn here is that the leading deviations from planckianity do not depend separately on @xmath21 or @xmath32 but only on their ratio .",
    "in this work , we have studied the robustness of the properties of black hole radiation in bec by considering flows characterized by a high asymmetry between the sub and the supersonic region .",
    "we found that the spectrum remains planckian until one approaches the critical cases ( @xmath80 ) where the surface gravity vanishes .",
    "in fact , for @xmath81 , since the fluid flows in the supersonic region with a velocity just above that of sound , the cutoff frequency @xmath13 goes to zero .",
    "hence the range of frequencies where the temperature @xmath46 is nearly constant shrinks and disappears in the limit .",
    "as expected , no emission of particles is found when the flow remains everywhere subsonic .",
    "the situation is much more interesting in the opposite case , for @xmath82 , when pushing the velocity of the subsonic region towards the speed of sound . in this regime , even though @xmath41 of goes again to @xmath5 , @xmath13 now increases . as a result ,",
    "the low frequency plateau of @xmath46 at low temperature again shrinks , but the spectrum becomes more and more blue .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that more dispersive modes , i.e. modes with higher @xmath44 , have still their turning point near @xmath83 where the gradient of @xmath84 is @xmath85 , which is now much higher than @xmath86 . when @xmath57 , there is no sonic horizon since the flow is everywhere supersonic .",
    "yet the spectrum is continuously deformed even though the planck character is completely lost in the frequency range @xmath87 , where @xmath70 is a new critical frequency . for @xmath88 ,",
    "new scattering channels open because there is a fourth asymptotic mode .",
    "investigations of this case  @xcite are in progress .    to conclude , we stress that the thermal spectrum at the nave surface gravity   provides a reliable approximation of the actual phonon spectrum in all cases but the critical ones where the sonic horizon disappears . in these extreme cases ,",
    "the spectrum is no longer thermal and its properties are governed by the dispersive properties of field .",
