    "density and concentration fluctuations in fluids and fluid mixtures can be investigated experimentally by light - scattering techniques .",
    "the nature of these fluctuations when the system is in equilibrium is a subject well understood@xcite .",
    "here we shall consider fluctuations in nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) , when an external and constant temperature gradient is applied , while the system remains in a hydrodynamically quiescent state .",
    "that is , we shall deal with fluctuations that are intrinsically present in thermal nonequilibrium states in the absence of any convective instabilities .",
    "such fluctuations have received considerable attention during the past decade@xcite .",
    "it was originally believed that , because of the existence of local equilibrium in ness , the time correlation function of the scattered - light intensity would be the same as in equilibrium , but in terms of spatially varying thermodynamic and transport properties corresponding to the local value of temperature .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that qualitative differences do appear . the first complete expression for the spectrum of the nonequilibrium fluctuations in a one - component fluid subjected to a stationary gradient",
    "was obtained by kirkpatrick et al.@xcite by using mode - coupling theory .",
    "they showed that the central rayleigh line of the spectrum would be substantially modified as a result of the presence of a temperature gradient . because of a coupling between the temperature fluctuations and the transverse - velocity fluctuations through the temperature gradient , spatially long - range nonequilibrium temperature and viscous fluctuations appear , modifying the rayleigh spectrum of the scattered - light intensity .",
    "their results were subsequently confirmed on the basis of fluctuating hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "the effect is largest for the transverse - velocity fluctuations in the direction of the temperature gradient which corresponds to the situation that the scattering wave vector , @xmath3 , is perpendicular to the temperature gradient @xmath1 , which configuration will be assumed throughout the present paper . in that case , the strengths of the nonequilibrium temperature and viscous fluctuations are predicted to be proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath4 implies that , in real space , the nonequilibrium correlation functions become long ranged@xcite .",
    "the spatially long - range nature of the correlation functions in ness is nowadays understood as a general phenomenon arising from the violation of the principle of detailed balance@xcite .",
    "experimentally , the long - range nature of the nonequilibrium fluctuations can be probed by light - scattering measurements at small wave numbers @xmath2 , i.e. at small scattering angles @xmath5 .",
    "such experiments have been performed in one - component liquids and excellent agreement between theory and experiments has been obtained@xcite .    in binary systems ,",
    "the situation is a little more complicated . in liquid mixtures or in polymer solutions",
    "a temperature gradient will induce a concentration gradient through the soret effect .",
    "this induced concentration gradient is parallel to the temperature gradient and has the same or opposite direction depending on the sign of the soret coefficient , @xmath6 . in this case ,",
    "nonequilibrium fluctuations appear , not only because of a coupling between the temperature fluctuations and the transverse - velocity fluctuations through the temperature gradient , but also because of a coupling between the concentration fluctuations and the transverse - velocity fluctuations through the induced concentration gradient .",
    "the nonequilibrium rayleigh - scattering spectrum has been calculated for binary liquid mixtures , both on the basis of mode - coupling theory@xcite and on the basis of fluctuating hydrodynamics@xcite , with identical results . in liquid mixtures in thermal nonequilibrium states not only nonequilibrium temperature and nonequilibrium viscous fluctuations , but",
    "also nonequilibrium concentration fluctuations exist .",
    "the strengths of all three types of nonequilibrium fluctuations are again predicted to be proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the theory was extended by segr et al.@xcite to include the effects of gravity and by vailati and giglio@xcite to include time - dependent nonequilibrium states .",
    "the nature of the nonequilibrium fluctuations in the vicinity of a convective instability has also been investigated@xcite , in which case the nonequilibrium modes become propagative .",
    "the influence of boundary conditions , which may become important when @xmath3 is parallel to @xmath1 , was considered by pagonabarraga et al.@xcite .",
    "experiments have been performed to study nonequilibrium fluctuations in liquid mixtures@xcite .",
    "the three types of nonequilibrium fluctuations have been observed in liquid mixtures of toluene and n - hexane@xcite and the strength of all three types of nonequilibrium fluctuations were indeed proportional to @xmath0 , as expected theoretically .",
    "initially , it seemed that also the prefactors of the amplitudes of these nonequilibrium fluctuations were in agreement with the theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "however , a definitive assessment was hampered by a lack of reliable experimental information on the soret coefficient@xcite .",
    "to our surprise , subsequent accurate measurements of the soret coefficient of liquid mixtures of toluene and n - hexane obtained both by khler and mller@xcite and by zhang et al.@xcite yielded values for the soret coefficient that were about 25% lower than the values needed to explain the quantitative magnitude of the amplitudes of the observed nonequilibrium fluctuations@xcite",
    ". subsequent measurements of the nonequilibrium concentration fluctuations in a mixture of aniline and cyclohexane , obtained by vailati and giglio@xcite did not have sufficient accuracy to resolve this issue .",
    "as an alternative approach , we decided to investigate nonequilibrium concentration fluctuations in a polymer solution . in a polymer solution",
    "the same nonequilibrium enhancement effects are expected to exist , but the mass - diffusion coefficient , @xmath7 , in this case is several orders of magnitude lower than in ordinary liquid mixtures .",
    "in addition , the soret coefficient is two orders of magnitude larger that the soret coefficient of ordinary liquid mixtures@xcite .",
    "these two facts , as discussed below , simplify the theory because , as also happens in an equilibrium polymer solution , the concentration fluctuations become dominant and they are readily observed by light scattering .",
    "both the data acquisition and the data analysis become much easier in this case .",
    "thus a polymer solution would seem to be an ideal system to further investigate nonequilibrium concentration fluctuations .    for this purpose",
    "we have selected solutions of polystyrene in toluene , for which reliable information on the thermophysical properties is available .",
    "we have performed small - angle rayleigh - scattering experiments in polystyrene - toluene solutions subjected to various externally applied temperature gradients .",
    "a summary of our results has been presented in a physical review letter@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we provide a full account of the experiment and of the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "a theory specifically developed for the fluctuations in polymer solutions in thermal nonequilibrium states is not yet available in the literature .",
    "however , for polymer solutions in the dilute and semidilute solution regime , as long as entanglement effects can be neglected , it should be possible to use the same fluctuating hydrodynamics equations as those for ordinary liquid mixtures . as mentioned in the introduction , the complete expression for the rayleigh spectrum of a binary liquid in the presence of a stationary temperature gradient",
    "was evaluated by law and nieuwoudt@xcite .",
    "the dynamic structure factor contains three diffusive modes .",
    "the decay rate @xmath8 of one of these modes is determined by the kinematic viscosity @xmath9 ; this mode disappears in thermal equilibrium , i.e. when @xmath10 .",

    "this coupling becomes important in compressible fluid mixtures near a critical locus@xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath20 , the dynamic structure factor of a binary system in ness consists of just three exponentials with decay rates given by : @xmath21 physically , it means that the temperature gradient @xmath1 induces nonequilibrium viscous fluctuations appearing as a new term in the rayleigh spectrum and it leads to nonequilibrium enhancements of the temperature and concentration fluctuations .",
    "the condition @xmath20 is always fulfilled in the low - concentration limit@xcite . but for some liquid mixtures @xmath22 is also small at all concentrations .",
    "for instance , in an equimolar mixture of toluene and n - hexane segr et al . found @xmath23 .",
    "for the dilute polymer solutions considered in the present paper , @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the approximations implying the presence of three diffusive modes with the simple decay rates given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay ] ) are even more justified for a polymer solution than for the liquid mixtures studied in previous papers@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ordinary polymer solutions @xmath25 ; such a small value simplifies the analysis of the concentration fluctuations , because the decay in the time correlation function coming from the concentration mode ( decay rate @xmath26 ) will be well separated from the decays of the modes with decays rates @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "actually , for the small angles employed in our experiments , the decay time of the @xmath26 mode is typically 0.5 - 1.5 s , whereas the decay times of the other two modes are around @xmath29 s. in addition , for a dilute polymer solution , the rayleigh factor ratio , that determines the ratio of the scattering intensities of the concentration fluctuations and the temperature fluctuations@xcite , is much larger than unity so that the contributions of temperature fluctuations are negligibly small in practice .",
    "moreover , when the experimental correlograms are analyzed beginning at @xmath30 s , viscous and temperature fluctuations have already decayed . this kind of approximation is usually assumed in the theory of light scattering from polymer solutions in equilibrium states@xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "for heterodyne light - scattering experiments in sufficiently dilute polymer solutions , the expression for the time - dependent correlation function of the scattered light becomes : @xmath31 e^{-d k^{2 } t } , \\label{eq : corr}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the signal to local - oscillator background ratio representing the amplitude of the correlation function in thermal equilibrium . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) the term @xmath33 represents the nonequilibrium enhancement of the concentration fluctuations .",
    "this term is anisotropic and depends on the scattering angle . when @xmath34 , @xmath35 reaches a maximum given by : @xmath36 where the strength of the enhancement , @xmath37 , is given by@xcite : @xmath38^{2 } { s_t}^2 \\over \\nu d } ~ \\left ( { \\partial \\mu \\over \\partial w } \\right)_{p , t } ~ \\left [ 1 + 2 { d \\over d_t } ( 1 + \\zeta ) \\right ] , \\label{eq : enhan11}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a dimensionless correction term related to the ratio of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "as mentioned earlier for the polymer solutions to be considered , @xmath42 is of the order of @xmath43 , so that the correction term inside the square brackets can be neglected in practice .",
    "hence , the expression for @xmath37 reduces to : @xmath38^{2 } { s_t}^2 \\over \\nu d } ~ \\left ( { \\partial \\mu \\over \\partial w } \\right)_{p , t}. \\label{eq : enhan2}\\ ] ]    the dependence of the nonequilibrium enhancement @xmath35 of the concentration fluctuations on @xmath4 indicates that the correlations in real space are long ranged .",
    "actually , a @xmath4 dependence in fourier space corresponds to a linear increase of the correlation function in real space @xcite .",
    "the rapid increase of the strength of the nonequilibrium fluctuations with decreasing values of the wavenumber will saturate for sufficiently small @xmath2 due to the presence of gravity .",

    "these small angles cause the stray light from window - surface scattering to be dominant , assuring that the measurements are in the heterodyne regime .",
    "hence , the light scattered from the inner surfaces of the windows plays the role of a local oscillator and provides the background with which our signal , the light scattered from the polymer solution , is mixed .    before starting the experiments , the light - scattering cell was carefully cleaned by flushing the cell with pure toluene for at least one hour .",
    "next , a gentle stream of nitrogen gas was continuously directed through the cell to dry the inner walls and to remove dust particles .",

    "it should be noted that a portion of the same polymer solution was introduced into an optical beam - bending cell for measuring the diffusion coefficient , @xmath7 , and the soret coefficient , @xmath6 , of the solutions as described by zhang et al.@xcite .",
    "these independent measurements of the diffusion and soret coefficients will be used to compare the results of our light - scattering measurements with the theoretical predictions . in the case of polymer solutions",
    "it is especially important to have independent measurements of these quantities for the same polymer / solvent system because , as commented below , there is a sizable dispersion in the literature data , mainly caused by the dependence of these coefficients on parameters difficult to control , such as the polydispersity of the sample .",
    "once the cell was filled with a polystyrene solution with known polymer concentration , we started the experiments by setting the temperature of the top and the bottom plates of the cell at 25@xmath74c .",
    "a light - scattering angle was then selected with the collection pinhole , and the distance in the collection plane between the pinhole and the center of the transmitted forward - beam spot was measured accurately . as already mentioned , this procedure , with the corresponding calculations , yielded scattering wave vectors @xmath2 with an accuracy of 1.5% .",

    "when the temperature of the polymer solution had stabilized , we used the alv-5000 to collect at least ten equilibrium light - scattering correlation functions , with the polymer solution in thermal equilibrium at 25@xmath74c . the photon count rate of these measurements ranged from 0.3 to 2.5 mhz , depending on the run .",
    "each correlation lasted from 30 to 60 minutes , with signal to background ratios from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . these small signal to background ratios confirm that our measurements are in the heterodyne regime .",
    "after having completed the measurements with the polymer solution in thermal equilibrium , we applied various values of the temperature gradient to the polymer solution by increasing and decreasing the temperatures of the top and bottom plates symmetrically , so that all experimental results correspond to the same average temperature of 25@xmath74c .",
    "the maximum temperature difference employed was 4.1@xmath74c , which corresponds to a maximum temperature gradient of 34.6  k  @xmath82 .",
    "the variation in the thermophysical properties of the solutions is negligible in this small temperature interval , and the property values corresponding to 25@xmath74c have been used for the calculations . after changing the temperatures , we waited at least two hours , to be sure that the concentration gradient was fully developed .",
    "then , for each value of the temperature gradient , about six correlograms were taken . in fig.[fnon2 ] , typical experimental light - scattering correlograms , obtained with the alv-5000 correlator at @xmath85 @xmath82 are shown for the solution with polymer mass fraction @xmath86 , as a function of the temperature gradient @xmath1 .",
