    "dust - reddened broad - line quasars could represent the crucial missing link between massive ultraluminous starbursts identified in far infrared and submillimeter surveys , and uv - luminous quasars in optical surveys .",
    "the study of these rare transitioning systems , has gained new impetus with the advent of sensitive wide - field infrared surveys such as the ukidss large area survey ( las ) @xcite , vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; mcmahon et al . in prep ) and wide infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ) all sky survey @xcite . in our previous work ( @xcite ; b12 hereafter )",
    ", we used the ukidss las to find a population of heavily dust - reddened ( @xmath0 ( vega ) ) quasars at @xmath122 corresponding to the main epoch of black - hole growth in the universe .",
    "this new sample of 12 confirmed reddened quasars was the first to be assembled using a pure near infrared ( nir ) selection and pushed 2 mags fainter than previous studies using 2mass , which had selected quasars that were considerably less red ( @xmath13 ) @xcite    sensitive nir surveys at 12@xmath9 m are well suited to searching for broad - line quasars at @xmath122 , with significant amounts of dust in their host galaxy . at these redshifts , the nir colours sample a portion of the rest - frame spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at @xmath20.30.8@xmath9 m that is very sensitive to dust extinction within the quasar host , but not to the hot - dust emission from the molecular torus at 13@xmath9 m @xcite .",
    "ground - based nir imaging also allows discrimination of luminous type 1 broad - line quasars that typically appear unresolved , and the less luminous type 2 sources where the host galaxy is often resolved .",
    "our aim in this work is to use initial data from the new vista hemisphere survey and the _ wise _ all sky survey completed this year , to devise a colour selection criterion for reddened broad - line quasars and subsequently test this selection method via spectroscopic follow - up of a small pilot sample .",
    "the infra - red colour selection scheme we use , should in principle be effective at isolating dust - reddened broad line quasars and the current study offers the first practical demonstration of this selection using new data from vhs and _ wise_. in addition , we also investigate the rest - frame infra - red seds of our full sample of reddened ( @xmath0 ) quasars using data from the _ wise _ all sky release . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat concordance cosmology with h@xmath14=70 kms@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the vega system unless otherwise stated .",
    "vhs is a nir photometric survey being conducted using the vista telescope in chile , that aims to survey 18,000 deg@xmath3 of the southern celestial hemisphere to a depth 30 times fainter than the 2mass survey in at least two wavebands ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) . in the south galactic cap ,",
    "4500 deg@xmath3 will be imaged deeper , including the @xmath20-band , and will have supplemental deep @xmath21 imaging provided by the dark energy survey .",
    "the remainder of the high galactic latitude sky will be imaged at @xmath22 and combined with optical photometry from the vst - atlas survey . in this work ,",
    "we use @xmath2180 deg@xmath3 data from the vhs vst - atlas overlap region at 205@xmath23ra@xmath24 and @xmath25dec@xmath26 .",
    "the vhs data in this region reaches average 5@xmath27 @xmath19-band depths of 18.2 ( vega ) .",
    "the _ wise _ satellite has conducted an all - sky survey at mid infrared wavelengths between 3.4@xmath9 m and 22@xmath9 m @xcite .",
    "_ wise _ specific mid - ir colour selection criteria for isolating both populations of obscured and unobscured agn have been devised @xcite .",
    "these authors propose a colour - cut of [ w1@xmath28w2]@xmath290.80.85 with a more conservative cut of [ w1@xmath28w2]@xmath300.7 suffering from less incompleteness but also prone to higher levels of contamination from populations of dusty and normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "these colour criteria have been shown to be extremely effective in selecting agn at intermediate redshifts but become incomplete when h@xmath31 moves into the w1 band at @xmath32 .",
    "the _ wise _ selection identifies agn independent of their reddening and so needs to be combined with additional colour information at shorter wavelengths in order to distinguish highly reddened quasars from those that are unobscured at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "in addition , morphological information from ground - based nir surveys can be used to separate dusty broad - line quasars from type 2 agn .",
    "our aim is to test the effectiveness of a joint vhs+__wise _ _ colour selection in isolating highly reddened quasars at z@xmath22 .",
    "we therefore identify reddened quasar candidates that satisfy the following selection criteria :    * @xmath0 and 13@xmath33 ( vega ) . a bright sample with @xmath3416.5 ( vega ) is prioritized for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "the @xmath35 colour - cut corresponds roughly to @xmath36 at @xmath11 .",
    "* unresolved or stellar - like point source classifications in the vhs nir images .",
    "this corresponds to _ _",
    "mergedclass__=@xmath281 in the vhs catalogues . * signal - to - noise of @xmath3710 in the @xmath19-band in order to ensure reliable morphological classifications .",
    "* candidates are required to be red in all the nir bands - i.e. @xmath38 & @xmath39 .",
    "the above nir only selection criteria produces @xmath2600 candidates with @xmath40 , 447 of which are at @xmath1 .",
    "many of these sources are expected to be spurious . in order to clean the sample ,",
    "it is matched to the _ wise _ all - sky source catalogue using a matching radius of 3@xmath41 and requiring a @xmath375@xmath27 detection in both the _ wise _ 3.4 and 4.6@xmath9 m bands .",
    "this reduces the candidate list to 321 sources .",
    "the vhs+__wise _ _ detected sources are then required to satisfy the additional criterion of [ w1@xmath28w2]@xmath300.85 , which produces 11 candidate reddened quasars with @xmath42 , seven of which are at @xmath43 . finally , the images for all candidates are visually inspected to create the sample for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "this visual inspection eliminates two sources with a close neighbour in the @xmath18-band , which may be affecting the @xmath18-band photometry , leaving five candidates , which are summarised in table [ tab : sample ] .        before presenting results of our spectroscopic follow - up , we first look at the expected effectiveness of our colour selection criteria presented above . in figure",
    "[ fig : select ] we show our red quasar candidates from vhs+__wise _ _ , with @xmath4417 in the @xmath35 versus ( w1-w2 ) colour - colour plane as well as our sample of already confirmed such reddened quasars from b12 . also shown",
    "are all point - like sources over the same area , down to the same flux limit in the @xmath19-band , 142 known uv - luminous quasars with @xmath4517 from the sdss data release 7 @xcite , which have been matched to vhs and _ wise _ , 114 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies from the iras 1jy sample @xcite and a sample of 73 l and t dwarf stars with ukidss - las and _ wise _ photometry @xcite .",
    "we also plot the tracks of a uv - luminous quasar , and an evolving elliptical galaxy template modelled as a simple stellar population with @xmath46 , using an updated version of @xcite and the publicly available web - based tool ezgal .",
    "the reddened quasars are significantly redder in terms of their @xmath35 colours compared to the bulk of point sources in the vhs as well as the cool l and t dwarf stars .",
    "the reddened quasars are also considerably redder than known uvx quasars in the sdss .",
    "luminous infrared galaxies could enter our selection box as illustrated by the comparison to the iras 1jy sample in figure [ fig : select ] but our morphological classification requirement of point sources in the @xmath19-band means that these ulirgs would have to be extremely compact and/or at high redshifts .",

    "we spectroscopically confirm two new reddened quasars in the vhs at z@xmath22 over an area of 180 deg@xmath3 .",
    "the quasars have broad lines , large bolometric luminosities and black - hole masses , and dust extinctions of a@xmath48=22.5 mags .",
    "we demonstrate that despite being intrinsically very luminous , they are too reddened by dust to be detected in wide - field optical surveys like sdss .",
    "we also present _ wise _ photometry for all our reddened broad - line quasars at z@xmath22 , including those selected using the ukidss - las ( b12 ) , as well as the 0.110@xmath9 m rest - frame seds for the entire sample .",
    "the rest optical sed power - law slopes reflect the different levels of dust extinction in our quasars , while the rest infrared power - law slopes are similar to type 1 qsos with hot dust emission and starburst qso hosts like mrk231 .",
