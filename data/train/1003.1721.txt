    "the hierarchical , merger - dominated picture of galaxy formation is based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model @xcite , which predicts that the observed galaxies and their dark halo ( dh ) were formed through a repeated merging process of small systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this framework",
    ", major and minor mergers of disky systems do play a major role in the formation of spheroid and elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in all environments and from the local group to high - redshift universe @xcite .",
    "the gas fraction is a key parameter in the physics of such gravitational interactions : if it is high enough , an extended and massive disk structure can survive ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies can get their gas through several interacting processes , such as smooth accretion , stripping and accretion of primordial gas , which are equally important in the growth of galaxies .",
    "recent theoretical works have argued that the accretion of external gas from the cosmic web filaments , with inclined angular momentum ( @xcite , @xcite ) , might be the most realistic way by which galaxies get their gas .",
    "this process may also explain the build - up of high redshift disk galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative share of all gravitational interactions depends on the environments and it drives many morphological features observed in galaxies , such as bars and polar rings .",
    "galaxies with polar rings ( prgs ) generally contain a central featureless stellar spheroid and an elongated structure , the `` polar ring '' ( made up by gas , stars and dust ) , which orbits in a nearly perpendicular plane to the equatorial one of the central galaxy @xcite . the decoupling of the angular momentum of the polar structure and the central spheroid can not be explained by the collapse of a single protogalactic cloud : thus a `` second event '' must have happened in the formation history of these systems .",
    "this is the reason why studying prgs promise to yield detailed information about many of the processes at work during galaxy interactions and merging ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the debate on the origin of prgs is still open and two main processes have been proposed _",
    "i ) _ a major dissipative merger or _",
    "ii ) _ gas accretion . in the merging scenario ,",
    "the prg results from a `` polar '' merger of two disk galaxies with unequal mass , ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) : the morphology of the merger remnants depends on the merging initial orbital parameters and the initial mass ratio of the two galaxies .",
    "in the accretion scenario , the polar ring may form by a ) the disruption of a dwarf companion galaxy orbitating around an early - type system , or by b ) the tidal accretion of gas stripping from a disk galaxy outskirts , captured by an early - type galaxy on a parabolic encounter ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the total amount of accreted gas by the early - type object is about @xmath5 of the gas in the disk donor galaxy , i.e. up to @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "both major merger and accretion scenarios are able to account for many observed prgs morphologies and kinematics , such as the existence of both wide and narrow rings , helical rings and double rings @xcite .    very recently , a new mechanism has been proposed for the formation of wide disk - like polar rings : a long - lived polar structure may form through cold gas accretion along a filament , extended for @xmath8 mpc , into the virialized dark matter halo @xcite . in this formation scenario , there is no limits to the mass of the accreted material , thus a very massive polar disk may develop either around a stellar disk or a spheroid .",
    "@xcite , by using high - resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy formation , have confirmed and strengthened the formation scenario proposed by @xcite . in this case",
    "polar disk galaxies can be considered as extreme examples of angular momentum misalignment that occurs during the hierarchical structure formation . in the merging history ,",
    "an inner disk formed first after the last major merger of two galaxies with a 1:1 mass ratio , then , due to the high gas fraction , the galaxy rapidly forms a new disk whose angular momentum depends on the merger orbital parameters . at later times",
    ", gas continues to be accreted along the disk which may be also in a plane perpendicular to the inner disk .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of one simulated object , in both simulations , are similar to those observed for ngc4650a : in particular , @xcite found that such formation mechanism can self - consistently explain both morphology and kinematics of central spheroid and polar structure , and all the observed features ( like colors and colors gradient , longevity , spiral arms , hi content and distribution ) .",
    "ngc  4650a is the prototype for prgs ( see fig .",
    "[ slit ] ) .",
    "its luminous components , inner spheroid and polar structure were studied in optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry , spectroscopy , and in the radio emission , hi 21 cm line and continuum ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the polar structure in ngc  4650a is a disk , very similar to that of late - type spirals or lsb galaxies , rather than a ring .",
    "the polar disk stars and dust can be reliably traced to @xmath9 kpc radius from the galaxy nucleus , and the surface brightness profiles have an exponential decrease ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the rotation curves measured from the emission and absorption line optical spectra are consistent with those of a disk in a differential rotation rather than that of a narrow ring @xcite .",
    "this is also confirmed by the hi 21 cm observations @xcite which show that the gas is five times more extended than the luminous polar structure , with a position - velocity diagram very similar to those observed for edge - on disks .",
    "the polar disk is very massive , since the total hi mass is about @xmath10 , which added to the mass of stars , makes the mass in the polar disk comparable with the total mass in the central spheroid @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the central spheroid resembles that of a low - luminosity early - type galaxy : the surface brightness profile is described by an exponential law , with a small exponential nucleus ; its integrated optical vs. nir colors are similar to those of an intermediate age stellar population ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "new high resolution spectroscopy in nir on its photometric axes suggests that this component is a nearly - exponential oblate spheroid supported by rotation @xcite .    these new kinematic data , together with the previous studied , set important constraints on the possible formation mechanisms for ngc4650a .",
    "because of the extended and massive polar disk , with strong @xmath11 emissions , ngc 4650a is the ideal candidate to measure the chemical abundances , metallicity and star formation rates ( sfr ) via spectroscopic measurements of line emissions along the major axis of the polar disk .",
    "the goal is to compare the derived values for the metallicity and sfr with those predicted by the different formation scenarios . as we shall detail in the following sections , if the polar structure forms by accretion of primordial cold gas from cosmic web filament , we expect the disk to have lower metallicities of the order of @xmath12 @xcite with respect to those of same - luminosity spiral disks",
    ".    we shall adopt for ngc4650a a distance of about 38 mpc based on @xmath13 and an heliocentric radial velocity @xmath14 , which implies that 1 arcsec = 0.18 kpc .",

    "for all galaxies of the sample , and in particular for spiral galaxies , the total luminosity is that of the whole system , i.e. bulge plus disk , therefore also for ngc4650a we have accounted for the total luminosity of the galaxy ( @xmath132 , evaluated by using the same value of @xmath133 used by @xcite in order to compare ngc4650a with galaxies in their sample ) , to which contributes both the central spheroid and the polar disk .",
    "we found that ngc4650a is located inside the spread of the data - points and contrary to its high luminosity it has metallicity lower than spiral galaxy disks of the same total luminosity .",
    "if we take into account the total luminosity of the polar disk alone ( @xmath134 ) , ngc4650a falls in the region where hii and irregular galaxies are also found , characterized by lower luminosity and metallicities with respect to the spiral galaxies .",

    "[ oh_t ] respectively : both of them show that metallicity remains constant along the polar disk .",
    "this suggests that the star formation and metal enrichment in the polar structure of ngc4650a is not influenced by the stellar evolution of the older central spheroid , where the last burst of star formation occurred between 3 to 5 gyrs ago @xcite : this turns also to be consistent with a later formation of the polar disk . the absence of any metallicity gradient is a typical behavior found in lsb galaxies @xcite , and also in the polar disk galaxy studied by @xcite , which has a very similar structure to ngc4650a . on the contrary ,",
    "ordinary and oxygen - rich spiral galaxies show a decreasing abundance with increasing radii ( see fig . [ fit ] and @xcite ) .",
    "these observed features in spiral disks are well explained by the infall models of galaxy formation which predict that they build up via accretion by growing inside - out ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and such process generates the observed gradients",
    ".    _ - star formation rate ( sfr ) _ +",
    "we have derived the sfr for the polar disk , from the @xmath2 luminosity using the expression given by @xcite @xmath138 .",
    "we found that it is almost constant along the disk , within a large scatter of the datapoint .",
    "therefore , given the average value of @xmath139 erg / s we have obtained an average @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the north and south arms respectively .",
    "these values are quite similar to the total sfr derived for the hii regions of prg iizw71 ( @xcite ) , which is @xmath142 . in order to make a comparison with sfr estimates for a sample of prgs studied by @xcite , we have derived a mean value of the @xmath2 flux by integrating within a rectangular aperture of @xmath143 along each arm of the polar disk and we have obtained an average value of @xmath144 .",
    "this value is consistent with the sfr of the hii regions in the prgs studied by @xcite , where @xmath145 . in particular , two prgs of this sample , ugc7576 and ugc9796 , where the polar structure is very similar to that of ngc4650a ( i.e. exponential surface brightness profile , very blue colors , knotty appearance , prominent hii regions and a large amount of hi gas , all associated to this component and distributed as a disk in differential rotation ; see @xcite and @xcite ) , have @xmath146 .",
    "as already stressed by @xcite , the hii regions of the prgs , including also ngc4650a , have sfr similar to late - type spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "in particular , by comparing the @xmath2 luminosity versus the total b magnitude , the polar disk galaxies , ngc4650a , ugc7576 and ugc9796 , are located in the same area where sc - irr galaxies are also found .",
    "taking into account that the polar disk is very young , since the last burst of star formation occurred less than 1 gyr ago @xcite , we check if the present sfr of 0.06 @xmath147 , and even 2 and 3 times higher ( i.e. @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) , can give the estimated metallicity of @xmath150 and how strongly could increase the metallicity with time .",
    "we used a linearly declining sfr @xcite @xmath151 $ ] ( typically used for late - type galaxies ) , to estimate the expected stellar mass for the three different values of the sfr ( 0.06 , 0.12 and 0.18 @xmath147 ) and three epochs ( 0.8 gyr , 1 gyr and 2 gyrs ) , obtaining stellar masses in the range @xmath152 . the stellar mass ( @xmath153 ) in the disk from nir observations @xcite falls within this range .",
    "than , by using the mass - metallicity relation derived by @xcite , where @xmath154 , we found that @xmath155 .",
    "this shows that the present sfr for the polar disk ( @xmath156 ) is able to increase the metallicity of about @xmath157 after 1gyr .",
    "the derived values for z are larger than @xmath158 , found by using the element abundances ( see sec.[emp ] ) : this differences could be attributed to the accretion of metal - poor gas , as discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "how galaxies acquire their gas is an open issue in the models of galaxy formation and recent theoretical works have argued that cold accretion plays a major role .",
    "this idea is supported by many numerical simulations suggesting that this could be an important mechanism in the galaxy formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied in detail the physics of the _ cold mode _ of gas accretion and one feature they found is that it is generally directed along filaments , allowing galaxies to draw gas from large distances .",
    "+ recently @xcite , using cosmological simulations , studied the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium as a key ingredient in determining the transition mass from cold to hot dominated accretion .",
    "their measurements turn to be consistent with the analytical prediction of @xcite in the low metallicity regime for the cold streams .",
    "the efficiency of radiative cooling decreases towards low metallicity , and at @xmath159 the cooling properties of the gas are those of a primordial mixture .",
    "gas accretion is bimodal both in temperature and in metallicity : the cold accretion mode is associated with a combination of metal - poor filamentary accretion and dense metal - rich satellite galaxy disc surrounding , while the hot mode features has strong chemical heterogeneity and a radius - dependent metallicity .",
    "more recent simulations of disk formation in a cosmological context performed by @xcite revealed that the so called chain - galaxies and clump - clusters , found only at higher redshifts @xcite , are a natural outcome of early epoch enhanced gas accretion from cold dense streams as well as tidally and ram - pressured stripped material from minor mergers and satellites .",
    "this freshly accreted cold gas settles into a large disk - like systems ; simulations show that the interaction region between the new - formed disk and the cold streams can also result not aligned with the initial galactic disk : based on a very poor statistics , @xcite suggest that this misalignment might not be typical , and it is due to a third cold stream that is perpendicular to the main filament . a more recent analysis by @xcite shows that the accretion of gas along misaligned filaments with respect to the disk plane are more common and it leaves traces down to low redshift . an almost polar filament can result just as an extreme case of such process and , as suggested by @xcite",
    ", it could be responsible for the formation of polar disks .",
    "+ this scenario not only reproduces the observed morphology and global rotation of disks , but also finds a realistic metallicity gradient and sfr of @xmath160 .",
    "@xcite found solar metallicity for the inner disk , while that in the clump forming region is only @xmath161 due to the accretion of pristine gas in the cold streams mixing with stripped satellite gas .",
    "therefore , the studies cited above suggest that the chemical abundance is one of the key parameters that can be estimated in a galaxy disk and directly compared with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this is the main goal of the present work : we studied the chemical abundances in the polar disk of ngc4650a in order to check the cold accretion scenario for this object .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations performed by @xcite and @xcite have shown that the formation of a polar disk galaxy can occur naturally in a hierarchical universe , where most low - mass galaxies are assembled through the accretion of cold gas infalling along a filamentary structures . according to @xcite , the polar disk forms from cold gas that flows along the extended @xmath162 filament into the virialized dark matter halo . the gas streams into the center of the halo on an orbit that is offset from radial infall .",
    "as it reaches the center , it impacts with gas in the halo of the host galaxy and with the warm gas flowing along the opposite filament .",
    "only the gas accreted perpendicular to the major axis of the potential can survive for more than a few dynamical lifetimes .",
    "+ @xcite argued that polar disk galaxies are extreme examples of the misalignment of angular momentum that occurs during the hierarchical structure formation : an inner disk starts forming shortly after the last major merger at @xmath163 . due to its gas rich nature",
    ", the galaxy rapidly forms a new disk whose angular momentum is determined by the merger orbital parameters .",
    "later , gas continues to be accreted but in a plane that is almost perpendicular to the inner disk . at @xmath164",
    "the central galaxy is still forming stars in a disk , while the bulk of new star formation is in the highly inclined polar disk . by @xmath165 the inner disk",
    "has exhausted its gas , while gas continues to fall onto the polar disk . from this point ,",
    "star formation occurs exclusively in the polar disk , that remains stable for at least 3 gyrs . +",
    "the formation mechanisms described above can self - consistently explain both morphology and kinematics of a polar disk galaxy and , in particular , all the observed features ( like colors and color gradients , longevity , spiral arms , hi content and distribution ) of the polar structure .",
    "the present study could be considered a step forward both to trace the formation history of ngc4650a and to give hints on the mechanisms at work during the building of a disk by cold accretion process .    as mentioned in the sec.[intro ] , the new kinematic data obtained for the central spheroid @xcite , together with the previous studies , set important constraints on the possible formation mechanisms for ngc4650a . in particular , the merging scenario is ruled out",
    "because , according to simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) , a high mass ratio of the two merging galaxies is required to form a massive and extended polar disk as observed in ngc  4650a : this would convert the intruder into an elliptical - like , not rotationally supported , stellar system .",
    "this is in contrast with the high maximum rotation velocity ( @xmath166 km / s ) observed in the outer regions of the central spheroid @xcite",
    ".    both the high baryonic mass ( star plus gas ) in the polar structure and its large extension can not reconcile with a polar ring formed via the gradual disruption of a dwarf satellite galaxy ( as explained by @xcite ) .",
    "differently , a wide polar ring and/or disk ( as observed in ngc4650a ) may form both around a disk or an elliptical galaxy through the tidal accretion of gas stripped from a gas - rich donor , in the case of large relative velocity and large impact parameter and for a particular orbital configuration ( e.g. @xcite ) . therefore , the two formation scenarios which can be really envisioned in the specific case of ngc4650a are the tidal accretion and the accretion of external primordial cold gas from cosmic web filaments ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "to this aim we have derived the metallicity and sfr for the polar disk in ngc4650a in order to compare them with those predicted by different formation scenarios .",
    "the main results of the present work are ( see also sec .",
    "[ res ] ) : _ i _ ) the low value of the metallicity derived for the polar disk @xmath167 , in spite of its high luminosity , @xmath168 ( see fig .",
    "[ conf ] ) , _ ii _ ) the lack of any metallicity gradient along the polar disk , which suggests that the metal enrichment is not influenced by the stellar evolution of the older central spheroid , _ iii _ ) the metallicities expected for the present sfr at three different epochs , @xmath169 , are higher than those measured from the element abundances and this is consistent with a later infall of metal - poor gas .",
    "if the polar ring / disk formed by the mass transfer from a gas - rich donor galaxy , the accreted material comes only from the outer and more metal - poor regions of the donor : is the observed metallicity for the polar component in ngc4650a consistent with the typical values for the outer disk of a bright spiral galaxy ?",
    "according to @xcite , the metallicity of very outer regions of a bright spiral is @xmath170 : the observed value for ngc4650a , @xmath150 , is close to the lower limit .",
    "+ the cold accretion mechanism for disk formation predicts quite low metallicity ( @xmath171 ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : such value refers to the time just after the accretion of a misaligned material , so it can be considered as initial value for z before the subsequent enrichment .",
    "how this may reconcile with the observed metallicity for ngc4650a ?",
    "we estimated that the present sfr for the polar disk ( @xmath172 ) is able to increase the metallicity of about 0.2 after 1gyr ( see sec.[res ] ) : taking into account that the polar structure is very young , less than 1gyr @xcite , an initial value of @xmath171 , at the time of polar disk formation , could be consistent with the today s observed metallicity . +",
    "this evidence may put some constraints also on the time - scales of the accretion process .",
    "the issue that need to be addressed is : how could a cosmic flow form a ring / disk only in the last gyr , without forming it before ?",
    "given that the average age of 0.8 gyr refers to the last burst of star formation , reasonably the gas accretion along the polar direction could have started much earlier and stars formed only recently , once enough gas mass has been accumulated in the polar disk .",
    "earlier - on , two possible mechanisms may be proposed .",
    "one process that may happen is something similar to that suggested by @xcite for the quenching of star formation in early - type galaxies : given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks , the polar structure could have been stable for a while and this could have quenched its star formation activity , until the accumulated mass gas exceeds a stability threshold and star formation resumes .",
    "alternatively , according to the simulations by @xcite , the filament could have been there for several gyrs with a relative low inclination , providing gas fuel to the star formation in the host galaxy first , about 3 gyrs ago .",
    "then large - scale tidal fields can let the disk / filament misalignment increase over the time till 80 - 90 degrees and start forming the polar structure during the last 1 - 2 gyrs .",
    "this picture might be consistent not only with the relative young age of the polar disk , but also with the estimate of the last burst of star formation in the central spheroid @xcite .",
    "one more hint for the cold accretion scenario comes from the fact that the metallicity expected by the present sfr turns to be higher than those directly measured by the chemical abundances . as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "both infall and outflow of gas can change a galaxy s metallicity : in the case of ngc4650a a possible explanations for this difference could be the infall of pristine gas , as suggested by ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of abundance gradient in the polar disk , as typically observed also in lsb galaxies , suggests that the picture of a chemical evolution from inside - out , that well reproduce the observed features in spiral disks ( @xcite , @xcite ) , can not be applied to these systems .",
    "in particular , observations for lsb galaxies are consistent with a quiescent and sporadic chemical evolution , but several explanation exist that supports such evidence @xcite . among them , one suggestion is that the disk is still settling in its final configuration and the star formation is triggered by external infall of gas from larger radii : during this process , gas is slowly diffusing inward , causing star formation where conditions are favorable . as a consequence ,",
    "the star formation is not self - propagating and the building - up of the disk would not give rise to an abundance gradient .",
    "the similarities between lsb galaxies and the polar disk in ngc4650a , including colors @xcite and chemical abundances ( this work ) , together with the very young age of the polar disk , the presence of star forming regions towards larger radii , the warping structure of outer arms ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the constant sfr along the disk ( this work ) , suggest that the infall of metal - poor gas , through a similar process described above , may reasonably fit all these observational evidences .      one important feature which characterize",
    "ngc4650a is the high baryonic ( gas plus stars ) mass in the polar structure : it is about @xmath173 , which is comparable with or even higher than the total luminous mass in the central spheroid ( of about @xmath174 ) . in the accretion scenario ,",
    "the total amount of accreted gas by the early - type object is about @xmath5 of the gas in the disk donor galaxy , i.e. up to @xmath6 @xmath7 , so one would expect the accreted baryonic mass ( stellar + gas ) to be a fraction of that in the pre - existing galaxy , and not viceversa , as it is observed for ngc4650a .",
    "furthermore , looking at the field around ngc4650a , the close luminous spiral ngc4650 may be considered as possible donor galaxy @xcite , however the available observations on the hi content for this object show that ngc4650 is expected to be gas - poor ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "so , where the high quantity of hi gas in ngc4650a may come from ? if the polar disk forms by the cold accretion of gas from filaments there is no limit to the accreted mass .    given all the evidences shown above , we can infer that the cold accretion of gas by cosmic web filaments could well account for both the low metallicity , the lack of gradient and the high hi content in ngc4650a . an independent evidence which seems to support such scenario for the formation of polar disks comes from the discovery and study of an isolated polar disk galaxy , located in a wall between two voids @xcite : the large hi mass ( at least comparable to the stellar mass of the central galaxy ) and the general underdensity of the environment can be consistent with the cold flow accretion of gas as possible formation mechanism for this object .",
    "the present work remarks how the use of the chemical analysis can give strong constraints on the galaxy formation , in particular , it has revealed an independent check of the cold accretion scenario for the formation of polar disk galaxies .",
    "this study also confirmed that this class of object needs to be treated differently from the polar ring galaxies , where the polar structure is more metal rich ( like ugc5600 , see sec .",
    "[ res ] ) and a tidal accretion or a major merging process can reliable explain the observed properties @xcite . finally , given the similarities between polar disks and late - type disk galaxies , except for the different plane with respect to the central spheroid , the two classes of systems could share similar formation processes .",
    "therefore , the study of polar disk galaxies assumes an important role in the wide framework of disk formation and evolution , in particular , for what concern the `` rebuilding '' of disks through accretion of gas from cosmic filaments , as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation @xcite .",

    "<S> the aim of the present study is to test whether the cold accretion of gas through a `` cosmic filament '' @xcite is a possible formation scenario for the polar disk galaxy ngc 4650a . </S>",
    "<S> if polar disks form from cold accretion of gas , the abundances of the hii regions may be similar to those of very late - type spiral galaxies , regardless of the presence of a bright central stellar spheroid , with total luminosity of few @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use deep long slit spectra obtained with the fors2 spectrograph at the vlt in the optical and near - infrared wavelength ranges for the brightest hii regions in the disk polar disk of ngc 4650a . the strongest emission lines ( [ oii ] @xmath1 , [ oiii ] , @xmath2 ) were used to derived oxygen abundances , metallicities and the global star formation rates for the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the deep spectra available allowed us to measure the oxygen abundances ( @xmath3 ) using the _ empirical method _ based on intensities of the strongest emission lines , and the _ direct method _ </S>",
    "<S> , based on the determination of the electron temperature from the detection of weak auroral lines , as the [ oiii ] at 4363  .    the oxygen abundance measured for the polar disk </S>",
    "<S> is then compared with those measured for different galaxy types of similar total luminosities , and then compared against the predictions of different polar ring formation scenarios .    </S>",
    "<S> the average metallicity values for the polar disk in ngc 4650a is @xmath4 , and it is lower that the values measured for ordinary spirals of similar luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the gradient of the metallicity is flat along the polar disk major axis , which implies none or negligible metal enrichment from the stars in the older central spheroid .    </S>",
    "<S> the low metallicity value in the polar disk ngc 4650a and the flat metallicity gradient are both consistent with a later infall of metal - poor gas , as expected in the cold accretion processes . </S>"
