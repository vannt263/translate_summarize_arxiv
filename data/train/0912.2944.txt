    "there has been increased interest in recent years in the possibility of massive gravitons .",
    "this is motivated in part by the discovery of cosmic acceleration , which might be explainable in terms of an infra - red modification of general relativity that gives the graviton a small mass ( e.g. @xcite ) , and in part by the idea that some theory involving massive gravitons could be the low energy limit of a non - critical string - theory underlying qcd ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as for so many other gravitational physics issues , it may be useful to consider the possibilities for massive gravitons in the simpler context of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) spacetime .",
    "the standard free - field description of massive gravitons , i.e. massive particles of spin-@xmath0 , is that due to fierz and pauli ( fp ) in terms of a symmetric tensor field , which we will call @xmath1 .",
    "the fp action is @xmath2 = s_{eh}^{(2)}[f ] - \\frac{1}{4 } m^2 \\int d^3 x\\ , \\left(f^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu } -f^2\\right)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 for minkowski metric @xmath4 , which we assume to have `` mostly plus '' signature , and @xmath5 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^3x \\ , f^{\\mu\\nu } g_{\\mu\\nu}^{(lin)}(f)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the linearized einstein tensor expressed as a self - adjoint differential operator acting on the tensor field @xmath7 ; the fp action therefore reduces to the quadratic approximation to the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action in the massless limit .",
    "the field equations are equivalent to @xmath8 the differential subsidiary condition is needed to remove ghost modes and the tracefree condition is needed to remove lower spin modes . in 4d",
    "the fp equations propagate the 5 helicity states of a massive spin 2 particle . in 3d",
    "they propagate the two @xmath9 helicity states of a massive spin 2 particle .",
    "the main issue of interest is whether one can generalize the fp free field theory to a consistent interacting theory .",
    "one could try to couple @xmath1 to some linear combination of the stress tensor and its trace but this leads to difficulties ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in 3d",
    "there is another option . to see this",
    ", we first solve the differential subsidiary condition by writing @xmath10 for some symmetric tensor potential @xmath11 .",
    "the remaining fp equations become @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the trace of the linearized ricci tensor @xmath14 .",
    "these equations are derivable from the quadratic action @xmath15 =   \\int d^3x\\ , \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2 } h^{\\mu\\nu } g_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\rm ( lin)}(h ) + \\frac{1}{m^2 } g^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\rm ( lin)}(h)s^{\\rm ( lin)}_{\\mu\\nu}(h )   \\right\\}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 this new quadratic action for symmetric tensor potential @xmath11 has an obvious extension to a non - linear generally covariant action for metric @xmath17 ; this yields `` new massive gravity '' ( nmg ) @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to give the nmg action in a slightly more general form involving a dimensionless parameter @xmath18 ; in appropriate units , this action is @xcite @xmath19 = \\int d^3x\\ ,   \\sqrt{-\\det g } \\left [ \\sigma r + m^{-2 } k \\right ] \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 the tensor @xmath21 is the 3d schouten tensor , which plays an important role in conformal gravity as the gauge potential for conformal boosts spacetime dimensions it is defined as @xmath22^{-1 } r \\ , g_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] . ] . to recover the quadratic action ( [ nmgquadact ] ) we should set @xmath23 , which means that the eh term has the ` wrong ' sign ( relative to the eh action of general relativity ) .",
    "we have arrived at the action for nmg by a method @xcite that guarantees its on - shell equivalence to the fp theory in the linearized limit .",
    "this method is a very general one @xcite but it does not guarantee _ off - shell _ equivalence .",
    "however , this can be proved very simply for nmg by means of the following alternative action involving an ` auxiliary ' tensor field @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath24 = \\sigma s_{eh}[g ] +   \\int d^3x \\sqrt{-\\det g } \\left [   f^{\\mu\\nu } g_{\\mu\\nu } - \\frac{1}{2 } m^2 g^{\\mu[\\rho } g^{\\nu]\\sigma } f_{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\rho\\sigma } \\right]\\ , .\\ ] ] this action , which is only 2nd order in derivatives , is quadratic in the tensor @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath7 field equation is @xmath25 ; using this equation to eliminate @xmath1 ( or integrating it out by gaussian functional integration in the path integral ) one recovers the action ( [ original ] ) in terms of the metric alone .",
    "this is true for any value of @xmath18 , so for @xmath26 the action ( [ altact ] ) constitutes a 2nd order version of the `` pure-@xmath27 '' model studied in @xcite .",
    "focusing on nmg proper , we set @xmath23 .",
    "to linearize about the minkowski vacuum , we now write @xmath28 and expand the action in powers of the minkowski space tensors @xmath29 . to quadratic",
    "order we find that @xmath30 = - s_{eh}^{(2)}[h ] + s_{fp}[f]\\ , .\\ ] ] since the quadratic eh action for @xmath11 propagates no modes , the modes propagated by the linearized nmg theory are the same as those of the fp theory and used the @xmath11 equation to eliminate @xmath11 from the action .",
    "this step was criticized in @xcite because it involves a back - substitution that is not generally permissible",
    ". however , the legitimacy of this back - substitution is manifest in the new basis implicit in ( [ gexpansion ] ) because it just eliminates the quadratic eh term , which propagates no modes .",
    "this change of basis was first made in @xcite ; it had occurred independently to us and we used it in our general analysis of unitarity for the ` cosmological ' extension of nmg @xcite . ] .",
    "higher - derivative extensions of 4d general relativity have been investigated since weyl s 1918 attempt at a unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "a special feature of curvature - squared invariants is that they contribute to the quadratic approximation in an expansion about a minkowski vacuum , so they contribute to the linearized field equations , which become fourth order rather than second order .",
    "equations of higher than second order generally propagate ghosts ( modes of negative energy ) in addition to physical modes , and this is what happens here , in 4d : in addition to the massless graviton , there is also a massive scalar mode and a massive spin-@xmath0 ghost @xcite .",
    "the 3d case is different because the eh action by itself does not propagate any modes , so the massless graviton is now absent .",
    "this means that we are free to change the overall sign of the action to arrange for the massive spin-@xmath0 modes to be physical , i.e. not ghosts ; we can then ensure that they are not tachyons by a choice of relative sign for the eh and curvature - squared terms .",
    "however , there is still the massive scalar mode , which is now a ghost .",
    "remarkably , the mass of this scalar ghost mode goes to infinity as the relative coefficient of the two independent curvature - squared terms is tuned to the value that yields the ` @xmath27-combination ' of ( [ kinv ] ) , so we end up with the unitary massive pure spin-@xmath0 model that is nmg .",
    "all of this can be read off from the results of nishino and rajpoot @xcite for the general 3d model with eh and curvature - squared invariants but these authors considered only the ` right - sign ' eh term and ( presumably as a consequence ) did not draw attention to the special features of the @xmath27-combination .",
    "one motivation for considering the eh action with the ` wrong ' sign is that this is a feature of `` topologically massive gravity '' ( tmg ) @xcite , which is also `` higher - derivative '' because it involves the third order , and parity violating , lorentz cherns - simons ( lcs ) term .",
    "tmg propagates only a single spin 2 mode , which is possible in 3d if parity is violated .",
    "this possibility can also be realized by a first - order `` self - dual '' spin-@xmath0 theory that can be thought of as the `` square - root '' of the 3d fp theory @xcite .",
    "if the differential subsidiary condition of this model is solved , the remaining equations become precisely those of linearized tmg , so tmg can be deduced by the same procedure that we used above to arrive at nmg .",
    "moreover , in this case the on - shell equivalence extends immediately to an off - shell equivalence because with only one propagating mode one can always choose the overall sign of the action so as to ensure that it is physical rather than a ghost .",
    "unitarity for nmg is a more delicate matter because there are two propagating modes .",
    "unitarity follows from the proof of off - shell equivalence to the fp theory reviewed above , but it can also be checked explicitly via a canonical analysis @xcite .",
    "a nice feature of this method is that one sees explicitly the cancellation of the higher time derivatives ; in other words , the action is actually second order in time derivatives despite being fourth order in space derivatives .",
    "this is reminiscent of hoava gravity @xcite but without any violation of lorentz invariance !",
    "there is a natural generalization of nmg that is suggested by tmg : one simply adds a lcs term to the action .",
    "this yields what we have called `` general massive gravity '' ( gmg ) @xcite .",
    "there are now two mass parameters , which can be traded for the two masses @xmath31 of the two spin-@xmath0 modes of helicities @xmath9 , which we may assume to be such that @xmath32 .",
    "as parity flips the sign of helicities , a model with @xmath33 breaks parity . when @xmath34 the parity - violating lcs term is absent and we recover nmg .",
    "the limit @xmath35 for fixed @xmath36 yields tmg , in which the curvature - squared term is absent , so both nmg and tmg are special cases of gmg .",
    "conversely , it is possible to recover gmg by a `` soldering '' of two tmg models @xcite , one propagating a helicity + 2 mode with mass @xmath36 and the other propagating a helicity @xmath37 mode with mass @xmath38 .",
    "in the case of 4d massless gravitons , it is known that any theory of interacting gravitons must reduce to general relativity at low energy @xcite .",
    "even if these low energy theorems continue to apply in 3d , they can not restrict the interactions of massive gravitons because these will decouple at sufficiently low energy .",
    "there is therefore no obvious reason why nmg should be the unique interacting extension of the 3d fp theory .",
    "indeed , an alternative parity - preserving generally covariant massive gravity model was recently proposed by baados and theisen @xcite ; their `` bigravity '' model for massive 3d gravitons is a 3d version of the 4d `` @xmath7-@xmath39 gravity '' of isham _",
    ". _ @xcite .",
    "the baados - theisen ( bt ) model involves a dimensionless parameter , which we shall call @xmath40 , and two tensor fields ; we shall use a different basis for these two fields and we call them @xmath41 .",
    "also , we omit here the cosmological terms included in @xcite ; we will later discuss briefly the cosmological extension .",
    "for @xmath42 , the bt action is @xmath43 = \\alpha s_{eh}[\\tilde g+ \\beta f ] + s_{eh}[\\tilde g -\\alpha\\beta f ]   - \\int d^3 x\\ { \\cal u } ( \\tilde g , f)\\ ] ] where @xmath44 the last term in the action is the potential term , defined by some choice of scalar density @xmath45 constructed from the metric tensor and the @xmath7-tensor , without derivatives .",
    "the choice made in @xcite has the form @xmath46\\sigma } f_{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\rho\\sigma } + { \\cal o}\\left(f^3\\right)\\ , .\\ ] ] a feature of the bt action is that it assumes invertibility of both @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we can interpret the invertibility constraint on , say , @xmath47 as the geometrical condition that @xmath47 be a metric tensor but invertibility of @xmath48 then puts a constraint on the tensor field @xmath7 that is not so obviously geometrical .",
    "the proof that linearized bigravity is equivalent to the fp theory is simple .",
    "we write @xmath49 and expand the action ( [ bgaction ] ) in powers of the minkowski space tensors @xmath29 .",
    "the result to quadratic order is @xmath50 = \\left(\\alpha + 1 \\right )   s^{(2)}_{eh}[h ] + s_{fp}[f]\\ , .\\ ] ] this is equivalent to the fp theory for any @xmath40 , because the quadratic eh action for @xmath11 propagates no modes , although we should recall the constraint @xmath51 .    if @xmath52 is initially taken as a free parameter then one finds that unitarity is violated if @xmath53 irrespective of the choice of @xmath52 , and that ( [ alphaeq ] ) can be imposed without loss of generality when @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath54 the action ( [ bgaction ] ) is equivalent to the eh action , so we can ignore this case .",
    "when @xmath55 , the action ( [ bgaction ] ) is trivial but it is also not equivalent to the action considered in @xcite ; in this case we should instead consider the action @xmath56\\right|_{\\alpha=-1 } = - s_{eh}[g ] + s_{eh}[g -f ] -    \\int d^3 x\\ { \\cal u } ( \\tilde g , f)\\ , .\\ ] ] linearization now yields the quadratic action @xmath57\\right|_{\\alpha=-1 } =   \\int d^3 x\\ ,",
    "\\left\\ { h^{\\mu\\nu } g_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\rm ( lin)}(f ) - \\frac{1}{4 } m^2 \\left ( f^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu } -f^2\\right)\\right\\}\\ , , \\ ] ] but this is precisely what one gets from linearization of ( [ altact ] ) when @xmath26 . as observed in @xcite , the @xmath11 tensor is now a lagrange multiplier imposing a constraint that has the solution @xmath58 . using this in the @xmath7 equation ,",
    "we find that @xmath59\\ , .\\ ] ] this equation determines the metric fluctuation tensor @xmath11 in terms of the source , which is itself constrained by the linearized bianchi identity ; this constraint is just the 3d maxwell equation @xmath60 , where @xmath61}$ ] .",
    "it is also true that the action ( [ quadminusone ] ) reduces to the 3d maxwell action upon making the substitution @xmath58 .",
    "either way , we see that a single massless mode is propagated , of undefined spin because spin is not defined for massless particles in 3d .",
    "this is consistent with the canonical analysis of the `` pure - k '' model @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a few brief observations on the cosmological extension of nmg and 3d bigravity . for nmg one may add the cosmological term @xmath62 =   -2\\lambda m^2 \\int d^3 x \\ , \\sqrt{-\\det g}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is a new dimensionless parameter .",
    "it is convenient in this context to also allow the parameter @xmath18 to be arbitrary , and to allow for @xmath64 .",
    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) vacua are possible for @xmath65 , and in such cases one may study the nature of the associated 2d conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this has a negative central charge whenever the quadratic approximation to the bulk theory ( expanded about the ads vacuum ) is unitary , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "there is one exception , for @xmath66 , in which the massive gravitons are replaced by massive spin 1 modes and the central charge of the cft is zero ; in this case the cft is of logarithmic type @xcite .    in the bigravity case we may add the cosmological term @xmath67 = \\frac{2\\left(\\alpha+1\\right)}{\\ell^2 }   \\int d^3 x \\",
    ", \\sqrt{-\\det \\tilde g}\\ , .\\ ] ] this allows an ads vacuum of radius @xmath68 for the metric @xmath47 , with @xmath69 .",
    "linearization about ads was considered in @xcite , and also in @xcite . `",
    "bulk ' unitarity requires either that @xmath70 or that @xmath71 . from our understanding of the results of @xcite , the central charge of",
    "the associated 2d cft is ( in our notation ) a positive factor times @xmath72 , which would mean that it is negative for @xmath73 but positive for @xmath74 .",
    "it would appear from this that 3d cosmological bigravity is analogous to cosmological nmg for @xmath73 but not for @xmath74 .",
    "this can be seen in vestigial form from the minkowski space actions : when @xmath73 the quadratic actions ( [ btquad ] ) are related by a rescaling ( which is trivial at @xmath75 ) but not when @xmath74 because of the different sign of the quadratic eh term ; although this does not affect the conclusions concerning propagating modes , and may continue to be irrelevant at the non - linear level in a minkowski vacuum , it makes a significant difference in an ads vacuum .    in conclusion , both nmg and 3d bigravity constitute generally covariant interacting extensions of the free - field 3d fierz - pauli model for massive particles of spin 2 .",
    "each will likely have its advantages and disadvantages . whether either will provide insight into the problem of massive 4d gravity",
