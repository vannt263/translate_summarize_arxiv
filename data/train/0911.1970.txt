    "a graded , infinite , directed graph defines a dynamical system called a bratteli - vershik or adic system ( see @xcite and the references given there for background on adic systems ) .",

    "the paths in the eulerian graph may be counted in many different combinatorial ways , but all attempts to extend those counts to the multi - dimensional analogues of the eulerian graph have failed up to this moment ; techniques applied to the two - dimensional eulerian graph , such as the recurrence of random walks in two dimensions in @xcite , the coding of paths by permutations in @xcite , or the left - to - right monotonicity in @xcite , are not available in dimensions higher than two .    in this paper",

    "such a graph models a random walk on the graph @xmath14 consisting of @xmath8 loops based at a single vertex , with a special kind of opposite reinforcement : when the walker takes a step in the direction of @xmath15 , the numbers of edges in all the other directions ( @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) are incremented by 1 ; but when the walker takes a step in the direction of @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , _ only _ the number of edges in the direction of @xmath15 is incremented by @xmath18 ( cf .",
