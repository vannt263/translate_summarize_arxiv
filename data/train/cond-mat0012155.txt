    "recently , kinetic equations with fractional derivatives have attracted attention as a possible tool for the description of anomalous diffusion and relaxation phenomena , see , e.g. , recent review @xcite , semi - review papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and references on earlier studies therein .",
    "it was also recognized @xcite , @xcite that the fractional kinetic equations may be viewed as `` hydrodynamic '' ( that is , long - time and long - space ) limits of the ctrw ( continuous time random walk ) scheme @xcite , which was successfully applied to the description of anomalous diffusion phenomena in many areas , e.g. , turbulence @xcite , disordered medium @xcite , intermittent chaotic systems @xcite , etc .",
    "however , the kinetic equations have two advantages over a random walk approach : firstly , they allows one to explore various boundary conditions ( e.g. , reflecting and/or absorbing ) and , secondly , to study diffusion and/or relaxation phenomena in external fields , both possibilities are difficult to realize in the framework of ctrw ( we point , however , to the paper @xcite , in which a fractional kinetic equation was obtained from generalized ctrw ) .",
    "fractional kinetic equations can be divided into three classes : the first one , describing markovian processes , contains equations with fractional space or velocity derivatives and the first time derivative , the second one , describing non - markovian processes , contains equations with fractional time derivative , and the third class , naturally , contains both fractional space and time derivatives , as well . in this paper",
    "we deal with a one - dimensional kinetic equation belonging to the first class , namely , with the fractional symmetric einstein - smoluchowski equation ( fsese ) , which , from one hand , is a natural generalization of the diffusion - like equation with the symmetric fractional space derivative @xcite,@xcite and , from the other hand , is a markovian generalization of the einstein - smoluchowski kinetic equation , which describes a motion of a particle subjected to a white gaussian noise in a strong friction limit , see , e.g. , @xcite . from this point of view",

    "we study the equilibrium solution of the fsese for non - linear lvy oscillator with the potential energy @xmath25 the models with the potential energy ( 1.7 ) play an important role in the theory of dynamical chaos @xcite and in the theory of brownian motion in an open auto - oscillation systems @xcite , and have various applications @xcite .",
    "one may expect that the models of non - linear lvy oscillator will also possess an important place in the theory of the systems influenced by non - gaussian lvy noises and obeying fractional kinetic equations . for our purposes",

    ", in sect.5 we present the discussion and summarize the results . some subsidiary studies , which support the results obtained in sec.4 , are presented in appendix a. an integral which is necessary for estimating asymptotics of the pdf  is calculated in appendix b.",
    "in this section , which is presented here mainly for the methodical purposes , we remind the equilibrium solution for non - linear brownian oscillator , @xmath37 . it is well - known , that in this case there is no need to pass to the equation ( 1.9 ) ; on the contrary , the starting point is the stationary equation , which follows from eqs .",

    "for this case we start from eq .",

    "the two important distinctive features of the equilibrium pdf for the cauchy oscillator are ( i ) the bimodality , and ( ii ) power law asymptotic at @xmath55 . the latter property is clearly visualized in a linear scale , whereas the former is better shown in a semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "it appears that both features are inherent not only to a non - linear cauchy oscillator , but also to equilibrium pdfs of non - linear lvy oscillators with the lvy indexes @xmath0 , such that @xmath56 . in the next section",
    "we get the solution for an arbitrary @xmath57between 1 and 2 and clearly demonstrate this fact .",

    ".    the terms @xmath69 and @xmath70 are , in fact , two independent particular solutions of eq .",
    "( 1.9 ) . since the condition at the infinity from eq . ( 1.10 ) has not been employed yet , the general solution thus depends on an arbitrary constant @xmath71 .",
    "we define it numerically by demanding    @xmath72    that is ,    @xmath73    our numerical simulations show that with @xmath63 increasing the value of @xmath71 rapidly reaches the constant value , which , of course , depends on @xmath0 .",
    "further increase of @xmath63 allows us to get @xmath71 with higher accuracy , that is , with more significant digits .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that the radius @xmath74 of convergence for both power sets in numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( 4.7 ) is infinite .",
    "this fact can be easily shown with the help of the cauchy - hadamard theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite , p. 300 ) , according to which , e.g. , for @xmath69    @xmath75 where the bar denotes the largest limit for the sequence @xmath76    in fig .",
    "2 the obtained solution for @xmath26 is shown in a linear ( at the top ) and in a semi - logarithmic ( in the bottom ) scales , @xmath77 .",
    "one can see an oscillatory character of the solution at large @xmath63 ; this property can not be visualized directly from the power series expansion .",

    "the derivation of it is presented in appendix a in detail . there",
    "we demonstrate that ( i ) the asymptotics has an oscillatory character and an exponentially decreasing amplitude , and ( ii ) the period of oscillations coincide with high accuracy with that obtained numerically from power series expansion , see fig.2 .",
    "thus , with the help of appendix a we have an independent evidence of the correctness of our procedure and of the solution presented in this section above .",
    "another evidence of the correctness of the obtained results stems from the comparison of the general expressions ( 4.1 ) - ( 4.5 ) with those for the two particular cases @xmath37 and 1 , presented in sect .. 2 , see eqs . ( 2.4 ) , ( 2.5 ) , and in sect .. 3 , see eqs .",
    "( 3.2 ) , ( 3.3 ) , respectively .",
    "indeed , let us consider brownian oscillator at first . by comparing expansion ( 4.1 ) at = 2 with that given by eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) one can see that the odd coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 given by eq .",

    "( 2.5 ) have the same recurrent relation as the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 given by eq . ( 4.5 ) have .",
    "now , let us compare general expressions with those for the cauchy oscillator . by comparing expansion ( 4.1 ) at @xmath38 with that given by eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) one can see that the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 in eq .",

    "( 4.5 ) . at last ,",
    "@xmath91 , which is also in agreement with general expansion , if we set @xmath38 in eq . ( 4.1 ) .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the general expansion ( 4.1 ) - ( 4.5 ) is in agreement with the particular cases of brownian and cauchy oscillators .",
    "however , we have to take in mind that for the brownian and cauchy cases we are able to evaluate coefficient @xmath92 analytically . on the contrary , for an arbitrary we have to estimate this coefficient numerically with the use of eq .",
    "( 4.7 ) . of course",
    ", the results of numerical and analytical estimates coincide for @xmath38 and 2 .",
    "now we consider two important properties which have been already discussed for the particular case of the cauchy oscillator in sect ..",
    "3 , namely , power law tails and bimodality .",
    "consider power law tails at @xmath93 at first .",
    "these asymptotics are determined by the first non - analytical term in the power series expansion ( 4.1 ) , that is , the term @xmath94 . by making an inverse fourier transform of this term",

    "( 4.8 ) that the equilibrium pdf has a power law tail , @xmath98 , and , thus the integer moments of the order greater than 3 diverge .",
    "this behavior is strikingly different from that of a non - linear brownian oscillator .",
    "the `` long tails '' can be explained qualitatively , if we turn to the langevin description of the lvy oscillator , the langevin approach relevant to the fsese [ 13 ] implies that the non - linear overdamped oscillator is influenced by  white lvy noise  @xmath99 , whose pdf behaves as @xmath100@xmath101at @xmath100@xmath102 . these  long tails ",
    "imply that the large absolute values of the noise occur frequently , which , in turn , lead to large increments of the coordinate .",
    "however , it is also clear that the pdf of the coordinate @xmath44 must fall off more rapidly at @xmath103 than the pdf of the noise @xmath104 , because of the presence of the potential well , which prevents @xmath44 from  escaping  rather far from the origin .    in fig .",
    "3 equilibrium pdf is shown by solid lines in a linear ( at the top ) and semi - logarithmic ( at the bottom ) scales .",
    "the pdf is obtained by an inverse fourier transform of the characteristic function shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath105 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate asymptotic ( 4.9 ) .",
    "one can see , especially from the semi - logarithmic plot , that the asymptotics is a good approximation beginning from @xmath63 equal nearly 2 . in this figure the second important property , namely , bimodality is clearly seen in a linear scale . in fig .",
    "4 the profiles of equilibrium pdfs ( obtained by an inverse fourier transform of corresponding power series in @xmath63 -space ) are shown for the different lvy indexes from @xmath38 at the top of the figure till @xmath37 at the bottom .",
    "it is seen that the bimodality is most strongly expressed for @xmath38 . with the lvy index increasing the bimodal profile `` smooths '' and ,",
    "finally , it turns to a unimodal one at @xmath37 , that is , for the boltzmann distribution .",
    "we also perform numerical simulation based on numerical solution of the langevin equation    @xmath106    where @xmath107is a white gaussian noise or a white lvy noise , whose generator is described in detail in our previous papers devoted to the studies of self - affine properties of ordinary and fractional lvy motions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a discussion on equivalency of the description of a stochastic system with the help of the langevin equation ( 21 ) and fractional kinetic equation ( 1 ) is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for the brownian motion this problem is discussed , e.g. , in ref .",

    "the result of numerical solution of the langevin equation must not depend on @xmath113 ; for the brownian oscillator this requirement is fulfilled at @xmath114 , whereas for the lvy oscillator @xmath115 .",
    "we also studied the time - dependence of the second moments and fix when the moments become constant , thus indicating equilibrium state . from the left",
    "figures a clear difference between trajectories of brownian ( above ) and lvy ( below ) oscillators is seen : there are large `` jumps '' on the figure below , which are due to existence of large `` pushes '' from an external lvy noise @xmath116or , equivalently , due to power law asymptotic of the pdf of the lvy noise @xmath104 .",
    "now we turn to the right figures .",
    "the designations are as follows .",

    "finally , the power law asymptotic ( 4.9 ) are depicted by a thin solid line 4 .",
    "it is seen from the figure above that the pdf obtained in numerical simulations agrees quantitatively with the boltzmann pdf , whereas the figure below demonstrates drastic difference between the boltzmann pdf and numerical pdf .",
    "the latter has long power asymptotic , which start far away from the maximum of the potential well curvature , and whose exponent is close to that obtained theoretically .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the results of numerical modeling for the lvy oscillators with different lvy indexes , see fig .",

    "the statistical averaging is over 50 trajectories , each consisting of 20.000 time steps , @xmath120 .",
    "dotted line depicts theoretical dependence @xmath121 of the asymptotic exponent versus @xmath0 .",
    "the results of numerical simulations coincide with analytical estimates within the error limits .    in fig .",
    "7 the results of numerical modeling are presented in more detail for small values of @xmath44 , when power law asymptotic is inadequate . similarly to fig . 5 ,",
    "thick solid line 1 and dotted line 2 show the potential well and its curvature , respectively .",

    "the lvy index is 1.2 .",
    "it is clearly seen that both pdfs are in qualitative agreement and the both are bimodal .",
    "therefore , from figs . 5 - 7 we may conclude that the results of simulations based on numerical solution of the langevin equation confirm qualitatively and even quantitatively the results based on analytical solution of eq .",
    "( 1.9 ) for the characteristic function .",
    "in this paper we study , both analytically and numerically , the properties of equilibrium pdf of a non - linear ( @xmath2 ) lvy oscillator , that is , the oscillator which is subjected to a white lvy noise obeying a lvy stable probability law . we restrict ourselves to the case of the lvy indexes such that @xmath123 .",
    "it is known that the lvy stable distributions ( as the gaussian one , which corresponds to @xmath57equal 2 ) appear in problems , whose result is determined by the sum of a great number of independent identical factors . since the brownian oscillator is subjected to a white gaussian noise , the lvy oscillator is a natural generalization of a brownian one .    for the analytical studies the starting equation is the so - called fractional symmetric einstein - smoluchowski equation , which contains fractional symmetric space derivative and is a natural generalization of the kinetic einstein - smoluchowski equation used in the theory of brownian motion .",
    "we get analytically the characteristic function of the equilibrium pdf in the form of a power series .",
    "its inverse fourier transform , realized numerically , allows us to obtain the pdf .",
    "the two main distinctive features of the equilibrium pdfs for non - linear lvy oscillator with @xmath124 are ( i ) the power law asymptotic at large x , and ( ii ) bimodality .",
    "both features imply that the pdfs for non - linear lvy oscillators are strikingly different from boltzmann distribution , which is equilibrium pdf for the brownian oscillator .",
