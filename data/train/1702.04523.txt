    "oxide materials with perovskite structure have drawn enormous amounts of interest for several decades due to their central role in fundamental research and technological applications .",
    "the remarkable properties of these materials such as colossal magnetoresistance @xcite , superconductivity @xcite and multiferroic behavior @xcite originate from the significant interplay between spin , charge and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "a key ingredient of this success is the structural versatility of the perovskite lattice which can incorporate a wide range of elements .",
    "the diversity of the perovskite materials and their properties has been regarded as a playground to explore novel and unique phenomena .",
    "for example , a wide variety of interesting physics was found in the lnmno@xmath7 family of manganites , including charge / orbital ordering and metal - insulator transition @xcite as well as multiferroic properties @xcite .",
    "some of fe@xmath8-based perovskites , such as bifeo@xmath7 @xcite , gdfeo@xmath7 @xcite and dyfeo@xmath7 @xcite , also exhibit coexistence of magnetism and ferroelectricity . the spin - state transition and electronic / ionic conductivity in lncoo@xmath7 have been investigated @xcite for decades .",
    "metal - insulator transition associated with a charge disproportionation has been found in ni - containing perovskites @xcite .",
    "another interesting family of perovskite oxides is orthochromites lncro@xmath7 , which crystallize into gdfeo@xmath7-type structure , with the @xmath1 space group .",
    "the magnetic properties of lncro@xmath7 compounds have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been found that these materials undergo afm transition with a simultaneous weak fm component .",
    "neutron diffraction studies have revealed that they adopt a @xmath3-type magnetic structure , where all nearest neighbour spins are antiparallel to each other @xcite .",
    "the fm component observed in lncro@xmath7 was attributed to a spin canting , allowed by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 -spin configuration ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 -spin configuration ) magnetic symmetry .",
    "it was also noted that with a decrease of the radius of the ln cation , the magnetic ordering temperature was monotonically reduced .",
    "zhou et al . have discussed the relationship between structural distortions and afm magnetic transition temperature @xcite .",
    "their work highlights the important role of @xmath13 hybridization , in addition to the reduction of the orbital overlap integrals .",
    "lncro@xmath7 perovskites also show some other interesting physical properties , such as spin - reorientation transition when ln = nd , sm , gd and er @xcite .",
    "recently , orthochromites have attracted revitalised interest due to the observation of a possible multiferroic behavior @xcite .",
    "high pressure synthesis is a well - known technique to expand stability of perovskite structure , which has very recently allowed new members of the cr@xmath8-based perovskites sccro@xmath7 , incro@xmath7 and tlcro@xmath7 to be investigated @xcite . similar to lncro@xmath0 , these materials crystallize into orthorhombic @xmath1 symmetry and undergo afm transition at t@xmath14=73 k , 93 k and 89 k , respectively . the magnetic transition ,",

    "it has been shown that in all cases , a = sc , in and tl , the structure combines both in - phase and out - of - phase octahedral tilting with the @xmath42 tilting pattern in the glazer s notation @xcite .",

    "our neutron diffraction data revealed that the @xmath1 symmetry of the nuclear structure of acro@xmath0 does not change down to 1.5 k and a polyhedral representation of the structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the structural parameters refined at 1.5 k are summarized in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "an important observation coming from the analysis of the structural parameters is the presence of uniaxial distortion of the octahedra , which is most pronounced in the case of incro@xmath0 .",
    "the distortion implies that two cr - o bond distances are notably longer than the other four ( fig .",

    "this is in contrast with lacro@xmath0 and other orthochromites with relatively large ln , in which the octahedra are nearly regular @xcite .",
    "the electronic configuration of the cr@xmath8 ions is not degenerate and the uniaxial elongation of the octahedra in the acro@xmath0 perovskites studied here is thus a secondary structural effect due to the large octahedral tilting rather than due to jahn - teller instability .",

[ fig:2 ] ) . in all three cases , sc- , in- and tl - based compositions , the magnetic scattering looks very similar ( fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) , suggesting the same type of the spin ordering . in previous reports @xcite ,",
    "a possible second transition at lower temperature has been suggested from ac susceptibility measurement .",

    "all the magnetic reflections can be indexed by @xmath45 propagation vector similar to the perovskites of the lncro@xmath0 family . a quantitative magnetic structure refinement ( fig .  [ fig:3 ]",

    "@xcite summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] yields the @xmath46-type of magnetic structure , with the @xmath5 magnetic symmetry .",

    "the spin structure is transformed by the @xmath48 irreducible representation which also transforms the @xmath49 and @xmath50 magnetic modes .",

    "the mechanism dominating the magnetic anisotropy of cr@xmath8 in the acro@xmath0 and related lncro@xmath0 perovskites is not obvious .",

    "the uniaxial elongation of octahedron lifts the degeneracy between the half - occupied @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 orbitals of cr@xmath8 , increasing the energy of the former and decreasing the energy of the latter two . in this case",
    ", the single ion anisotropy is assumed to be dominated by the spin - orbit interaction between the occupied @xmath88 and empty @xmath89 electronic states , resulting in the easy axis type of anisotropy as suggested in the recent perturbation theory by whangbo et al .",

    "the local easy axes are tilted away from the @xmath4-direction , following the octahedral rotations ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . when this type of anisotropy is combined with the strong symmetric superexchange interactions , requiring a collinear spin alignment , it yields the @xmath4-axis as the global easy axis of the nearly collinear magnetic structure . finally , let us note that the swapping from the @xmath12 spin configuration in ycro@xmath0 to the @xmath10 one in lucro@xmath0 due to a single ion anisotropy effect has been also proposed in the early work by kadomtseva et al .",
