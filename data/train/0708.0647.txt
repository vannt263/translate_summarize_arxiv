    "in higher - dimensional , low - scale gravity scenarios  @xcite , black holes can be produced in high - energy particle collisions such as those anticipated from the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "most of these models predict that black holes will rapidly decay in four successive phases of which hawking evaporation  @xcite may dominate .",
    "accordingly , the hawking evaporation phase has been the most studied decay phase in higher - dimensional models .",
    "the thermodynamic description of black holes  @xcite has been a powerful tool for probing quantum gravity aspects of black hole physics .",
    "the statistical mechanical interpretation of hawking evaporation treats the black hole as a constant temperature reservoir that allows the emission of particles in thermal equilibrium with the black hole .",
    "while this is probably a good approximation for large black holes , its applicability to small primordial black holes or higher - dimensional black holes in low - scale gravity is not clear .",
    "modelling emissions with the canonical ensemble from these types of black holes is inappropriate since a black hole in asymptotically flat spacetime can not be in stable thermal equilibrium with its radiation .",
    "consequently , when the mass of the black hole is close to its temperature , its evaporation will be modified .",
    "the hawking evaporation picture can be improved by applying the laws of statistical mechanics to ensure that the evaporation remains thermodynamically valid below the planck scale .",
    "this can be done by using back - reaction corrected emission in a microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "in addition , ref .",
    "@xcite has provided an alternative implementation of the back reaction of the emitted radiation through a modification of the relation between the black hole radius and its temperature .",
    "the effects of quantum gravity should become important at the mass scales we will consider . since the thermodynamic description of quantum systems is often a useful tool , the microcanonical description of black hole evaporation can be expected to remain valid in the quantum regime near the planck scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec2 ] reviews hawking evaporation . following this , sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] introduces the microcanonical ensemble and back - reaction corrected emissions .",
    "it also discusses the regime in which the microcanonical description becomes important .",
    "[ sec4 ] addresses the measurable particle energy spectra .",
    "[ sec5 ] argues that , at the lhc , the microcanonical corrections will probably not be important .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the applicability of the modified energy spectrum if new heavy particles are emitted from black holes .",
    "hawking radiation is not described by a pure quantum - mechanical state but by a density matrix .",
    "it is completely thermal in that the probabilities of emission of particles in different modes and probability of emitting different number of particles in the same mode are completely uncorrelated .",
    "the probability for different numbers of particles agree exactly with thermal radiation .",
    "it is assumed in hawking evaporation that the black hole emits non - interacting particles .",
    "the expectation value of the number of particles @xmath0 of a given species emitted in a mode with frequency @xmath1 , angular momentum @xmath2 about the axis of rotation of the black hole , and charge @xmath3 is    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a statistics factor that is @xmath6 for bosons and @xmath7 for fermions ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the surface gravity , surface angular frequency of rotation , and surface electrostatic potential ; the species dependent @xmath11 is the fraction of the mode that would be absorbed were it incident on the black hole .",
    "since the expected number of particles emitted in each mode is the same as that of a thermal body whose absorptivity matches that of the black hole , the temperature of the black hole has been identified as @xmath12 .",
    "hawking evaporation can be described by a number density .",
    "the number density represents the available states that can be occupied by hawking radiation . for a non - rotating and non - charged black hole ,",
    "the number density is most often represented by the canonical ensemble number density    @xmath13    where @xmath1 is the energy of the emitted particle ( usually assumed to be massless ) and the frequency - dependent ( grey - body ) factor @xmath14 has been ignored for now . there are also charged and rotating black hole solutions , which contribute to the grand canonical ensemble in which the electronic potential and rate of rotation act as the chemical potential for charge and angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "the canonical ensemble is a hypothetical collection of systems of particles used to describe an actual individual system , which is in thermal contact with a heat reservoir but not allowed to exchange particles with its environment .",
    "the black hole is treated as a heat bath of fixed temperature and the back reaction of the particles on the black hole metric is neglected .    because the temperature of a black hole increases as the mass decreases , it can not be in stable thermal equilibrium .",
    "in addition , in asymptotically flat spacetime , black holes have a negative specific heat thereby implying that the canonical ensemble does not apply . hawking emission of particle energies close to the black hole mass have non - negligible back reactions .",
    "this back reaction is responsible for modifying the temperature .",
    "thus the heat - bath assumption breaks down as the mass of the black hole approaches the planck scale .",
    "the back reaction of the metric has not yet been completely solved .    for black holes with mass of the order of the planck scale , or less ,",
    "the thermodynamical picture is no longer a good approximation of the true microcanonical description .",
    "we can make the above description valid from a thermodynamic point of view , even when the energy of the emitted particle is close to the black hole mass , by using the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the statistical mechanical description of black holes does not provide any time information .",
    "two extreme views can be taken . at one extreme ,",
    "all the emissions can be considered to occur so quickly that the black hole mass , and thus temperature , is approximately constant at its initial value during the decay .",
    "this is the so called `` sudden approximation '' view take by dimopoulos and landsberg  @xcite .",
    "the other extreme view is that the decay takes a long time and the black hole reaches thermal equilibrium after each emission before emitting the next particle .",
    "this quasistationary picture is adapted throughout this paper .",
    "to describe black hole decay , we will employ the microcanonical ensemble of a large number of similar insulated systems each with a given fixed energy .",
    "each of these systems will then have a number of different configurations compatible with the given energy .",
    "these configurations then form a shell in the configuration space of the system .",
    "as time passes , the system moves from one point to another in this shell .",
    "then by the assumption of ergodicity , the probability of the whole system being a particular one in a chosen region of configuration space is proportional to the number of configurations in that region whose energies lie within an infinitesimal range .    the microcanonical ensemble number density for a single - particle microstate is given by the exponential of the change in black hole entropy before and after the emission    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the entropy of the black hole with initial mass @xmath17 and @xmath18 the entropy of the black hole after emitting a particle of energy @xmath1 .",
    "this single - particle distribution can be understood by interpreting the occupation of states as arising from a tunnelling probability  @xcite .",
    "the distribution has also been derived as the emission rate from excited @xmath19-branes using the microcanonical ensemble with back - reaction corrected emission rates in field theory  @xcite .    from the single - particle number density ,",
    "the average particle density can be obtained by counting the multiplicity of states according to their statistics  @xcite :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 .",
    "this distribution approaches the thermal distribution ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath22 .",
    "the number density has similarities to an ideal gas of thermal radiation in equilibrium with a fix - temperature heat bath .",
    "the @xmath23 argument in the exponential of the canonical multiparticle number density has essentially been replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 has the nice property of always being bounded between 0 and 1 .",
    "@xmath25 is the change in entropy of the black hole due to a single particle being in a state with mode energy @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath26-th particle state is defined by a change in entropy , not in energy value",
    ". a @xmath26-particle state changes the entropy by @xmath27 , but does not have an energy @xmath28 . for fixed @xmath17 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the change in entropy is the constant quantity that sets the spacing between adjacent modes .",
    "more than one particle in a state must be viewed as moving to that state simultaneously before the black hole mass can change . for a black hole ,",
    "the mass and entropy can not change in such a way as to keep the temperature fixed .",
    "in other words , the mass and temperature of the black hole change in such a way as to keep @xmath25 constant . the energy of the black hole plus particle system is conserved .",
    "thus the distribution represents the back - reaction corrected number density of an ideal gas .",
    "we refer to ( [ eq4 ] ) as the multiparticle distribution for back - reaction corrected emissions in an ensemble of particle - occupied excited modes .",
    "the ideal gas analogy should not be pushed too far as the equivalent @xmath3 or @xmath29 function to the canonical or grand canonical ideal gas do not allow a straight forward determination of the macroscopic properties of the gas .",
    "equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) is not the only possibility for the multiparticle number density . by considering a black hole as an extended quantum object ( @xmath30-brane ) , which is made of other black holes , and then considering",
    "a gas of @xmath30-brane black holes  @xcite , the occupation number density for the hawking particles in the microcanonical ensemble has been proposed as    @xmath31    in thermodynamic equilibrium , the statistical mechanical density of states is @xmath32 . by identifying the total energy of the system with the initial black hole mass , we write    @xmath33    where @xmath34 denotes the integer part of @xmath35 .",
    "this distribution approaches ( [ eq4 ] ) and thus the thermal distribution ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath22 .",
    "now each @xmath26-particle state is defined by a mode energy and changes the black hole entropy by a different amount .",
    "the number of particles in a state is not determined by the particle statistics but rather by truncating the sum appropriately to conserve energy . each term can be viewed as a state but the number of particles in each state is not fixed .",
    "for example , one particle in a state with energy @xmath28 is the same as @xmath26 particles in a state with energy @xmath1 .",
    "since each term can be viewed as a different energy of emission , and thus entropy change , @xmath1 represents the quanta of energy or mode energy . when plotting @xmath36 versus @xmath1 we are allowing the mode energy @xmath1 to vary .",
    "the plot built up by scanning through the mode energies is the same as scanning through the particle energies .",
    "we refer to ( [ eq6 ] ) as the multiparticle distribution of back - reaction corrected emissions in a microcanonical ensemble of @xmath30-brane defined black holes .",
    "since ( [ eq6 ] ) does not include the emitted particle s statistics factor @xmath5 , it must be added by hand or the equation can only be applied for large changes in entropy , where the evaporation is governed by boltzmann statistics .",
    "equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) has been used to calculate the black hole lifetime  @xcite . in four dimensions ,",
    "the evaporation rate @xmath37 diverges at @xmath38 if the canonical number density ( [ eq2 ] ) is used .",
    "the canonical ensemble justifies the use of the sudden approximation . on the other hand , using the microcanonical number density ( [ eq6 ] ) leads to a finite decay rate and gives a lifetime for black holes with @xmath39 that is @xmath40 times longer than that given by the canonical number density  @xcite . in higher dimensions , @xmath37 is finite and slows down in the later stage of evaporation .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble justifies the use of the quasistationary approximation .",
    "we can understand the relationship between ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) a bit better by restoring the units in ( [ eq6 ] ) ( as pointed out by casadio and harms  @xcite ) to get    @xmath41    in the classical limit for fixed @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the upper limit in the sum @xmath45 .",
    "only the lowest - order term proportional to @xmath23 remains when expanding the argument of the exponential . since @xmath46 , @xmath44 is equivalent to @xmath47 .",
    "thus the finite sum becomes important at black holes masses near the planck scale , and ( [ eq6 ] ) can be considered the quantum version of ( [ eq4 ] ) .    to compare the number densities , expand the entropy to leading order in @xmath48 to obtain    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the black hole specific heat .",
    "thus for @xmath22 , the microcanonical number density approaches the back - reaction corrected density and canonical density .    to examine the higher - order contributions , we need to write down the entropy expressions .",
    "for a black hole of mass @xmath17 and horizon radius @xmath51 in @xmath52 extra - dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime , the entropy is    @xmath53    and the entropy differences is    @xmath54\\ , .\\ ] ]    assuming the maximum difference between the distributions occurs at the highest energy emissions ( in the kinematic limit @xmath55 )    @xmath56 \\right\\}\\ , .\\ ] ]    the biggest difference from a thermal distribution occurs at low values of @xmath52 :    @xmath57    for large @xmath58 ( large @xmath59 ) ,    @xmath60    the exponential in @xmath61 dies quickly so the correction factor in the numerator does not have much effect . for small @xmath58 ,",
    "the exponential is of the same order as @xmath62 . in this case",
    ", the correction factor will have a significant effect .",
    "experimentally , we measure the energy spectra for different particle types . the energy spectra can be predicted from the number density as follows .",
    "the particle emission rate from a non - rotating and non - charged black hole in three dimensions is    @xmath63    for isotropic massless particle emission ,    @xmath64    often we consider the energy spectrum as a probability distribution and normalize ( [ eq15 ] ) to unity over some region of energy .",
    "this is especially common for monte carlo generators like charybdis  @xcite .    in the rest frame of the black hole , conservation of energy - momentum",
    "requires a particle with mass @xmath2 to be emitted with an energy @xmath1 in the range    @xmath65\\ , .\\ ] ]    the canonical distribution ( [ eq2 ] ) does not respect energy - momentum conservation and any value of @xmath1 is allowed .",
    "although the thermodynamic concept breaks down for @xmath66 , the distribution does not enforce this condition . throughout this paper ,",
    "the minimum black hole mass is assumed to be close to a planck scale of about 1  tev .",
    "the exact value of the planck scale is not too important since the black hole mass is expressed in terms of the planck scale .",
    "however , the planck scale can not be much higher than a few tev if we are to observe black holes at the lhc . assuming the heaviest particle continues to be the top quark at lhc energies",
    ", the largest value of the emitted particle energy will be only 3% above the value @xmath67 .",
    "we thus neglect the particle mass and take the upper limit on the emitted particle energy to be @xmath67 .",
    "this kinematic limit affects most of the decays and modifies the energy spectrum of emitted particles in the canonical ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the definition of the planck scale is important when considering energies near the planck scale .",
    "the pdg  @xcite definition of the planck scale    @xmath68    has been chosen for use throughout this paper .",
    "this definition causes the factor in the entropy that does not depend on the ratio of the black hole mass to planck scale to increase monotonically with increasing number of dimensions .",
    "if the dimopoulos and landsberg definition is used , a minimum in the entropy factor occurs at @xmath69  @xcite . for the pdg definition of the planck scale and seven extra dimensions",
    ", the black hole mass approaches its temperature when it is about 0.3 times the planck scale . in the following ,",
    "cases for @xmath70 to 7 are studied , @xmath70 is referred to as low dimension and @xmath71 as high dimension .",
    "we now examine the affect the different number densities have on the particle energy spectra .",
    "table  [ boson ] shows the maximum difference between the canonical and back - reaction corrected energy spectra for different dimensions for bosons .",
    "table  [ fermion ] shows the corresponding results for fermions .",
    "the maximum differences range from about 10% to 26% and occur at a black hole mass equal to the planck scale for bosons and equal to about 1.3 times the planck scale for fermions .",
    "the maximum differences occur at a temperature of about 225  gev and an entropy of about 4 . in all cases , except for four dimensional black holes emitting bosons , the maximum difference occurs at temperatures well below the black hole mass .",
