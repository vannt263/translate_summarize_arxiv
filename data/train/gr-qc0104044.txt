    "the thermodynamics of self - gravitating system has some importance in the context of cosmology .",
    "the long - range nature of gravity gives rise to the breakdown of the conventional description of statistical properties , such as the additivity of the free energy or other ` extensive ' thermodynamical quantities .",
    "while the statistical treatment of non - equilibrium systems has recently been developed , the existence of the long range force seems essential for explaining the formation of the peculiar local structure in the system .",
    "recently , de vega and snchez studied the statistical mechanics of the self - gravitating particle gas@xcite .",
    "they showed that the ` thermodynamic limit ' must be taken as @xmath1 with @xmath2 fixed in three dimensions , where @xmath0 is the number of particles and @xmath3 is the volume of the system .",
    "this treatment is required by the long - range nature of gravity , because there is no _ ad hoc _ cut - off scale .",
    "on the other hand , two of the present authors have studied the statistical mechanics of the well - separated charged particles in einstein - maxwell - scalar theory@xcite .",
    "the system was found to be unstable in general , though there exists a critical case in which the static forces are cancelled each other .    in general relativity ,",
    "the critical case was investigated and exact static solutions which describe multi - black hole systems have been obtained @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the attractive forces ( the gravitational and scalar - mediated forces ) and the repulsive forces ( the electrostatic force ) between black holes are exactly cancelled in the static limit . in this case , the energy of the system was calculated for small velocities but for small distances between the black holes@xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the multi - black hole system by adopting the technique of de vega and snchez@xcite .",
    "note that a mass - charge relation is satisfied for each individual black hole .",
    "such extreme black holes , or so - called bps black holes , often appear in string theories .",
    "besides being of theoretical ( academic , methodological ) interest , the study on the thermodynamical aspects of them may be applied to the scenario of ` string cosmology ' .",
    "we consider ` bps black holes ' in @xmath4 dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory , which is governed by the action @xmath5\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is the scalar curvature and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , while @xmath9 is a dilaton field and @xmath10 is a coupling constant .",

    "thus the solution can be viewed as the one for an ` @xmath0 bps black hole ' system , where the electric force is cancelled by the forces mediated by the graviton and the dilaton .",

    "the present work provides a guideline for such numerical calculations to survey the critical points of the ` bps black hole ' gas .    for the near - extremal cases",
