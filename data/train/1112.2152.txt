    "progress in neutrino oscillation experiments gradually confirms that neutrinos are massive and oscillate @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical understanding of the origin of the mixing pattern and the smallness of neutrino masses has not yet been settled .",
    "many suggestions on possible models for neutrino mixing and masses have been made .",
    "for example , the t2k data @xcite on @xmath3 has motivated models on discrete flavor groups and corrections to the original tri - bimaximal mixing @xcite .",
    "the miniboone antineutrino data @xcite has renewed the interest on sterile neutrinos @xcite and extra higgs doublets can also be a source of new neutrino properties @xcite .",
    "neutrino masses and oscillations seem to require new physical scales that are not present in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "there are at least three new scales involved : the neutrino mass scale , the lepton number violation scale and the parity breaking scale .",
    "all these scales enter in one of the most appealing extensions of the sm , the left - right symmetric models @xcite .",
    "these models start from the simple gauge structure of @xmath4 and can , hopefully , be tested at the lhc energies .",
    "parity can be broken at the @xmath5 scale .",
    "but it can also be broken by a neutral singlet sector , as in the @xmath6-parity mechanism developed by chang , mohapatra and parida @xcite .",
    "small neutrino masses can be generated by the seesaw mechanism . in this case ,",
    "lepton number violation is introduced by majorana terms at very high ( gut ) energies .",
    "an alternative is the inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite . in the original version of the inverse seesaw mechanism ,",
    "a new left - handed neutrino singlet is introduced .",
    "if one imposes lepton number conservation in this sector , there are no majorana mass terms .",
    "a new right - handed neutral fermion singlet is also present and it is allowed to violate lepton number at a very small scale .",
    "this small scale is responsible for the small neutrino mass . in this scenario",
    "no ultrahigh breaking scale is introduced .    from another point of view ,",
    "mirror models have recently @xcite been studied and it was shown that three additional mirror families are consistent with the standard model if one additional inert higgs doublet is included .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we summarize the scalar content of the model . in section",
    "iii we present the fundamental fermionic representation of the model . in section",
    "iv we discuss the gauge interactions and identify the neutrino fields and new @xmath0 interactions . in section",
    "v we present the model predictions for the lhc energies .",
    "finally we summarize the model and its phenomenological consequences in section vi .",
    "the fundamental scalar representation in our mirror model contains the following higgs scalars : two doublets @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which develop the vacuum expectation values @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , @xmath11    where @xmath12    with transformation properties under @xmath13 given by @xmath14 .",
    "the singlet fields of the model are @xmath15 , which develops a v.e.v . at a very small scale and is coupled with majorana mass terms , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , which must couple to lepton number conserving terms ( dirac ) at a tev scale .    for the lepton number violating singlet",
    "we impose the symmetry , @xmath18 and for the lepton number conserving singlets , @xmath19    these scalar fields will develop vacuum expectation values according to @xmath20    the motivation behind these symmetries is to generate a simple spectrum for the neutrino sector ( see section iii )",
    ". the @xmath21 field will be broken at the same scale of the sm higgs field @xmath22 .",
    "the new @xmath10 scale can be searched for at the lhc energies in the @xmath23 tev range .",
    "the bound from neutrinoless double beta decay will imply ( see section iv ) that @xmath24 tev and @xmath25 tev .",
    "the @xmath15 singlet field will break lepton number at a small scale @xmath26 ev and will give small neutrino masses .",
    "the most general scalar potential invariant under the preceding symmetries has more than twenty new parameters .",
    "we can obtain constrained equations and stability conditions from a simpler form , still consistent with the stated symmetries :    @xmath27    the @xmath28 doublets will give masses to the gauge bosons of @xmath29 respectively .",
    "there will remain five neutral scalar higgs fields in the model .",
    "it is straightforward , although lengthy , to find the constraint equations and hessian matrix that guarantee the minimum conditions .",
    "they are explicitly given in the appendix .",
    "the approximate eigenvalues of the squared - mass matrix are given by @xmath30 \\nonumber\\\\ & & m_3 ^ 2\\simeq 4\\left [ \\lambda_4 ( v_r^2+v_l^2 ) + \\sqrt { \\lambda_4 ^ 2 ( v_r^2-v_l^2)^2 + \\lambda_5 ^ 2 \\ , v_l^2 v_r^2 } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & m_4 ^ 2\\simeq \\left [ \\lambda_3 + 2 \\lambda_2 - \\vert \\lambda_3 - 6 \\lambda_2 \\vert \\right ] v_{m_r}^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & m_5 ^ 2\\simeq \\left [ \\lambda_3 + 2 \\lambda_2 + \\vert \\lambda_3 - 6 \\lambda_2 \\vert \\right ] v_{m_r}^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the most prominent feature of these expressions is the prediction for the squared - mass value that corresponds to the standard model higgs .",
