    "the existence of a crack in a stressed elastic medium does not necessarily mean that a catastrophic failure is in sight ; otherwise many home owners would be in a constant state of panic .",
    "indeed , one of the major objectives of the theory of fracture mechanics is to predict when the existence of a crack would necessarily lead to the failure of materials .",
    "a crucial ingredient of such a prediction is the determination of the state of deformation of a given material in the presence of the said crack under the effect of a given external loading .",
    "this calculation is not available for arbitrarily shaped cracks even in two dimensional elastic media . to explain the difficulty consider for a moment an existing crack in an infinite two dimensional medium . under given load conditions",

    "the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ irwin ] ) is that the crack will initiate ( and may cause failure ) when the elastic energy flowing from the stress field in the bulk to the tip region is at least as large as the energy lost by lengthening the crack ( bond breaking or any other energy cost involved ) . in the case of the straight crack failure",

    "we still expect both eqs .",
    "( [ uniform ] ) and ( [ irwin ] ) to remain valid .",
    "the problem is then how to compute the stress intensity factors @xmath0 and @xmath1 when the crack is _ not _ straight .",
    "indeed , a well known paper by cotterell and rice @xcite offers such an analytic calculation for a _ slightly curved _ crack in perturbation theory in the amount of deviation from the straight crack .",

    "a large body of research is devoted to direct numerical techniques like the finite element method @xcite . in this paper",
    "we offer a non - perturbative approach to the calculation of the _ full _ stress field of an arbitrarily shaped crack based on a conformal mapping technique .",

    "5 offers a short summary and a discussion .",
    "the theory of elastostatic fracture mechanics in brittle continuous media is based on the equilibrium equations for an isotropic elastic body @xcite @xmath18 for in - plane modes of fractures , i.e. under plane - stress or plane - strain conditions , one introduces the airy stress potential @xmath19 such that @xmath20 thus the set of eq .",

    "this choice , although not the most general , is of great interest and will serve to elucidate our method .",
    "other solutions may be obtained by superposition .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions at infinity , for the two in - plane symmetry modes of fracture , are presented as @xmath22 in addition , the free boundary conditions on the crack are expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the arc - length parametrization of the crack boundary and the subscript @xmath25 denotes the out - ward normal direction .    the solution of the bi - laplace equation can be written in terms of _ two _ analytic functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath28 \\ . \\label{uphichi}\\ ] ] in terms of these two analytic functions , using eq .",

    "one freedom is now used to choose @xmath41 to be real and two more freedoms will allow us later on to fix @xmath42 . then , using the boundary conditions ( [ mode1 ] ) and ( [ mode2 ] ) , we find @xmath43",
    "as said above , the direct determination of the stress tensor for a given arbitrary shaped crack is difficult . to overcome the difficulty we perform an intermediate step of determining the conformal map from the exterior of the unit circle to the exterior of our given crack .",
    "currently the best available approach for such a task is the schwartz - cristoffel transformation . here",
    "we will present an alternative new approach for finding the wanted conformal transformation , given in terms of a functional iteration of fundamental conformal maps .",
    "the use of iterated conformal maps was pioneered by hastings and levitov @xcite ; it was subsequently turned into a powerful tool for the study of fractal and fracture growth patterns @xcite . in the next subsection",
    "we describe how , given a crack shape , to construct a conformal map from the complex @xmath44-plane to the physical @xmath40-plane such that the conformal map @xmath45 maps the exterior of the unit circle in the @xmath44-plane to the exterior of the crack in the physical @xmath40-plane , after @xmath25 directed growth steps .",
