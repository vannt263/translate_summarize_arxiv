    "galaxies in the local universe span a range of star formation histories . at the beginning of the spectrum are gas - rich , low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies that either have just begun the process of star formation or have been processing their gas with extremely low efficiencies . at the other end",
    "are gas - poor galaxies that typically have formed the bulk of their stars in the distant past and are currently devoid of gas ( roberts 1963 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) .    creating a sample that bridges these two regimes requires the union of two different methods of identifying galaxies .",
    "stars dominate the visible light output of most galaxies , and thus galaxies detected by traditional optical imaging have well developed stellar populations .",
    "in contrast , the natural way to identify gas - rich , less evolved galaxies is by their 21 cm radio emission .",
    "selecting on hi reveals galaxies entirely based on their gas content , independent of their starlight , and thus easily finds systems with intact gas reservoirs ( e.g. rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) .",
    "characterizing the stellar and gaseous properties of galaxies selected in the radio and in the optical will therefore yield information about the entire continuum of galaxy star formation histories ( burkholder , impey & sprayberry 2001 ) .    aside from its importance for global star formation , a sample of gaseous and stellar information for galaxies in the nearby universe also allows for a more complete census of the local baryons ( rosenberg , schneider & posson - brown 2005 ) . too often , galaxy studies neglect the fact that hi dominates the baryonic content of many galaxies , particularly those with low masses .",
    "the baryonic makeup of the nearby universe puts important observational constraints on simulations of galaxy formation and evolution as well as revealing reservoirs of mass that were previously undetected because of their optical lsb nature ( disney 1976 ) . the hi data also provide kinematic constraints on the dark matter content of the galaxies ( blanton , geha & west 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , with both optical and hi information , we can probe how the baryonic content relates to total mass of the galaxy .",
    "we present the first step toward an inventory of the hi and optical properties of nearby galaxies .",
    "our study focuses on an hi - selected sample and therefore identifies many systems that have retained much of their primordial hi .",
    "it lacks the systems that have used their entire gas supply and are dominated by stars .",
    "a separate project is underway to complete the nearby baryonic census by filling in the gas poor systems with hi observations of optically selected galaxies .",
    "this study combines data from two high quality , uniform surveys , the parkes equatorial survey ( es ; garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; gunn et al . 1998 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ; hogg et al . 2001 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ; stoughton et al . 2002 ; pier et al .",
    "2003 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2004 ; gunn et al . 2006 ; tucker et al .",
    "the combination of these two surveys creates a rich compendium of stellar and hi parameters for galaxies at various evolutionary states that will be used in future papers to explore how global star formation proceeds in galaxies as a function of their physical parameters .",
    "previously , most hi surveys were targeted at specific locations , thus little was known about the distribution of hi in the universe , independent of optical properties .",
    "henning ( 1992 ; 1995 ) used the nrao 300 ft telescope to conduct an hi blind survey and recovered 39 sources .",
    "large blind surveys followed using the arecibo 300 m telescope , yielding hundreds of sources and allowing for the first statistically sound studies of the hi mass function ( zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ; spitzak & schneider 1998 ; rosenberg & schneider 2000 ; rosenberg & schneider 2002 ) .",
    "these blind surveys also identified many un - cataloged lsb galaxies and paved the way for more complete studies of the baryonic content of nearby galaxies ( rosenberg , schneider & posson - brown 2005 ) .",
    "recent studies have combined large hi surveys with optical and infrared samples , namely the arecibo duel beam and slice surveys with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ; rosenberg et al . 2005 ) , the merging of the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) with supercosmos ( hambly et al . 2001a",
    "; hambly , irwin & macgillivary 2001b ; hambly et al . 2001c ; doyle et al . 2005 ) , and the combination of hipass with dss / possii data ( wong et al .",
    "rosenberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) were able to probe the baryonic content of a large sample of galaxies , but were limited by the shallow depth of 2mass , which does not have data for many of the lsb galaxies in the sample .",
    "the hipass / supercosmos / dss samples of doyle et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and wong et al .",
    "( 2009 ) contains optical / ir data for several thousand hi selected galaxies but also suffer from the shallow depth of the supercosmos / dss optical data .",
    "many studies have investigated the relationships between gas and stars in galaxies ( e.g. , roberts 1963 ; fisher & tully 1981 ; scodeggio & gavazzi 1993 ; kennicutt , tablyn & condon 1994 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ; haynes et al .",

    "; helmboldt et al . 2004 ; rosenberg , et al .",
    "2005 ; serra et al . 2007 ; walter et al . 2008",
    "; disney et al . 2008 ; zhang et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , many of these have relied on small inhomogeneous samples .",
    "these studies have been sufficient to establish the broad trend of increasing gas - richness in low mass systems , but they are limited in their ability to constrain more accurate relationships between gas , stars and galaxy mass , as well as the intrinsic scatter in these physical quantities .",
    "the advent of large astronomical surveys allows for unions of these large surveys to yield multi - wavelength , uniform data sets with small systemic errors and large sample sizes ( e.g. salim et al .",
    "2005 ; ag \" ueros et al . 2005 ; obri et al .",
    "2006 ; covey et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , several studies have combined large hi surveys with large optical and infrared datasets . in the first of these , rosenberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigated how the infrared stellar light compares to the hi gas emission .",
    "although rosenberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) were able to probe the baryonic content of a large sample of galaxies , they were limited by the shallow depth of 2mass , which does not have data for many of the lsb galaxies in the sample .",
    "their study therefore excludes the galaxies at the extreme gas - rich end of the evolutionary spectrum .",
    "another large - scale blind hi survey is the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; barnes et al . 2001",
    "; meyer et al . 2004 ; zwaan et al . 2004 ; wong et al . 2006 ) , which has been combined with ir and optical catalogs ( doyle et al . 2005 ; wong et al . 2009 ) that are very similar to our es / sdss catalog ( see below ) .",
    "in fact , a large fraction of the es data is in the hipass catalog ( see garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "2009 for more information ) .",
    "while the hipass studies have much more sky coverage than our es / sdss catalog , the depth of the sdss allows us to probe optical magnitudes several times fainter and recover optical counterparts for all of the hi sources in our footprint .",
    "the union of sdss and the es provides the desired uniformity in both the optical and the radio ( hi ) data , along with remarkable depth and dynamic range of the optical sdss data . although there is only a modest area of sdss / es overlap ,",
    "enough data exist for the construction of a uniform hi - selected catalog that can be used to probe how the baryonic content of galaxies changes as a function of other physical parameters .",
    "this paper is one of several papers utilizing the combined es / sdss data . in this paper",
    "we describe the sample selection , discuss the methods by which we derive the optical photometric parameters , and present the optical data .",
    "we briefly describe the sample characteristics and compare our sample to an optically selected sample in a similar volume .",
    "other papers describe the hi data ( garcia - appadoo et al . 2009 ) and explore the gas fractions , colors ( west et al .",
    "2009 ) , and dynamics of the es / sdss galaxies .",
    "the es was carried out with the parkes multibeam system on the 64 m radio telescope in parkes , australia ( stavely - smith et al .",
    "the es , which is described in detail in an accompanying paper ( garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "2009 ) , circles the celestial equator between -6 @xmath0 + 10 and contains over 1000 sources in 5738 square degrees .",
    "the raw data forms part of hipass ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 ; meyer et al . 2004",
    "; zwaan et al . 2004 ; wong et al . 2006 ) , carried out with the same instrument over the entire sky between -90 @xmath0 + 25 .",
    "however , the es fields were searched much earlier ( garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "2009 ) in readiness for comparison with the earliest sdss data .",
    "while the search techniques were much the same as the hipass team s and rely heavily on their procedures , the source lists are not identical .",
    "for example , the completeness limit of the es list is 30% fainter than the hipass limit .",
    "this is mainly due to our ability to follow - up and confirm a higher proportion of the fainter sources , a process that would be impractical with the larger survey .",
    "garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) includes a more detailed comparison between hipass and the es .",
    "the es covers a velocity range from -1280 to 12700 km  s@xmath1 with an rms noise of 13 mjy .",
    "the velocity resolution of the es hi spectra is 18.0 km  s@xmath1 and the 3@xmath2 hi mass limit of the survey is @xmath3 , assuming a 200 km  s@xmath1 hi galaxy profile . for detailed descriptions of the data acquisition ,",

    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the es data cubes were searched using an automated search code written in miriad .",
    "1164 sources were extracted from regions of the sky where sdss overlaps were likely to occur . for each source detection ,",
    "the hi spectrum was extracted by fitting a baseline to the background flux ( barnes et al .",
    "the source position , recessional velocity , 20% peak velocity width , peak and integrated fluxes were measured from the spectrum . for further details on the hi source extraction and parameter measurements for the es - sdss sample ,",
    "see the description in garcia - appadoo ( 2009 ) .",
    "the optical data for this study come from the sdss data release 2 ( dr2 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) sky area .",
    "the dr2 area is 3324 deg@xmath4 , @xmath51700 deg@xmath4 of which overlaps with the 5738 square degree es region discussed above .",
    "the majority of the overlap falls along the @xmath6=0 strip ( excluding the galactic plane ) and the dr2 coverage of the northern galactic cap ( -5@xmath75 ; see garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "2009 for further details ) .",
    "automatic pipelines ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ; lupton et al .",
    "2002 ) reduce the raw data and store the derived quantities in a catalog . the sdss photometric pipeline ( photo ; lupton et al .",
    "2002 ) is optimized for speed and the faint end of galaxy population .",
    "galaxies in the tail of angular size distribution ( large ) and surface brightness distribution ( low ) often have unreliable measurements ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "therefore , aside from the initial catalog matching described below , no sdss catalog data were used for this study .",
    "all photometric quantities were obtained using a new set of techniques optimized for deriving large galaxy photometry .",
    "the sdss automatic pipelines were optimized for angularly small , faint objects .",
    "it was found that the sdss catalog values for angularly large , bright galaxies are often unreliable .",
    "before we re - derive the photometric values for the es / sdss sample , we will briefly discuss and quantify two of the problems with large , bright galaxies in the sdss , namely issues with deblending ( or shredding ) , and sky subtraction .",
    "both of these problems have been discussed in previous papers ( e.g. abazajian et al .",
    "2004 , 2009 ) but require additional attention as they have particular relevance for the es / sdss sample .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline ( photo ; lupton et al . 2002 ) identifies objects in sdss fields and extracts them into individual atlas images for photometric analysis .",
    "when one objects falls in front ( or near ) another on an sdss field , the parent images is sent to the deblender .",
    "the deblender separates the two objects into children and photometry is performed on both images independently . for most objects in sdss",
    ", this process works well .",
    "however , in galaxies with large angular extent , irregular morphology or low - surface brightness , photo deblends more children than it should ; hii regions and spiral arms are frequently separated from their parent galaxies . because these galaxies are `` shredded '' into multiple pieces , accurate photometry is prohibited by the standard photometric pipeline .",
    "using the es / sdss sample , we demonstrate the amplitude of the deblending problems in the sdss catalog .",
    "some of the galaxies deblend perfectly ; no significant amount of flux has been removed and the foreground stars have been correctly deblended . however , in some cases , the deblending is quite extreme .",
    "figure [ deblend ] shows the 7 children that were shredded off of the es / sdss source hipeq1124 + 03 .",
    "the aggressive deblending resulted in the brightest child ( upper left ) only containing 50% of the of total flux .",
    "the sdss catalog photometry for hipeq1124 + 03 is therefore completely unreliable .",
    "we quantified the magnitude of the deblending problem in the es / sdss sample by examining the fraction of flux in the brightest child for each of the es / sdss galaxies .",
    "figure [ distphot ] shows a cumulative distribution of of the fraction of flux contained in the brightest child for the es / sdss sample .",
    "roughly 75% of the the galaxies have more than 90% of their flux contained in the brightest child .",
    "the remaining 25% have irregular morphologies , are flocculant ( hii regions are removed as stars ) or have low surface brightness , with a number of brightest children having less than 50% of the total galaxy flux .",
    "we discuss our method for remedying the deblending problems in the es / sdss sample in section 4.1 .",
    "problems with the sky subtraction for bright sdss galaxies have been recently identified in the literature ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "2005 ; bernardi 2007 ; lauer et al .",
    "2007 ; adelman - mccarthy et al . 2008 ; abazajian et al .",
    "previous simulations indicate that the magnitude of the sky subtraction error can be as high as 0.4 magnitudes ( masjedi et al .",
    "2006 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) . like deblending , the sky subtraction algorithm ( see lupton et al .",
    "2002 ) is optimized for small , faint objects and using a 256 @xmath8 256 pixel mask to determine the sky value every 128 pixels in an sdss field .",
    "if a galaxy in the field takes up an appreciable fraction of the mask , the sky is overestimated ( and over - subtracted ) .",
    "therefore , we find that angular size , and not magnitude is the main determiner of sky subtraction error .",
    "figure [ skyex ] shows a reconstructed sdss field ( top ; see section 4.1 ) and the rebuilt sky ( bottom ) for es / sdss source hipeq1232 + 00a .",
    "an accurate sky determination should yield a smooth surface .",
    "however , the bottom panel clearly contains flux from the galaxy , which results in fainter magnitudes when it is subtracted from the top image .    to investigate the magnitude of the sky subtraction problem for the es / sdss sample",
    ", we ran our photometric software ( see section 4.4 ) on the es / sdss galaxies with both the standard sdss sky subtraction and our sky determination ( see section 4.2 ) and compared the results . figure [ skymag ] shows the difference in @xmath9-band magnitude between the 2 sky subtraction methods for all of the es / sdss galaxies as a function of the area of the galaxy ( determined at the 90% light radius ) . while the effect is negligible for small galaxies ( @xmath10 0.5 @xmath11 ) , galaxies with angular areas of @xmath51 @xmath11 have magnitude errors greater than 0.2 magnitudes",
    "there are several galaxies in the es / sdss sample where the magnitude error from sky subtraction is larger than 1 magnitude .",
    "the scatter in fig . [ skymag ] implies that other parameters beyond angular size affect the flux lost to sky subtraction errors . instead of looking at the magnitude difference ( which is fractional flux )",
    ", we explored the actual flux lost as a function of galaxy size , magnitude and axis ratio .",
    "the larger galaxies fill more of the sky mask , resulting in more of their flux being subtracted .",
    "but the amount of flux depends on the surface brightness of the source ( which depends on magnitude , area and axis ratio ) .",
    "we fit a hyper - plane to the logarithms of the flux lost ( in nanomaggies=22.5 - 2.5@xmath12(nmgy ) ] ; blanton et al .",
    "2003b ) , the r - band magnitudes , the petrosian 90% light radii and the axis ratios ( all measured using the sdss catalog values ) .",
    "figure [ skyfit ] shows the projection of the best - fit hyper - plane for all of the es / sdss galaxies and can be described by :    @xmath13    where the flux is measured in units of nanomaggies , @xmath14 is the sdss petrosian 90% light radius measured in arcseconds , and @xmath15 is the axis ratio of the galaxy . the axis ratio ( @xmath15 ) is determined from the major and minor axes derived from sdss isophotal photometry ( isoa and isob in photo respectively ) . future analysis of bright , angularly large galaxies in sdss can be corrected at the catalog level using eq .",
    "1 . however ,",
    "for the es / sdss sample , we will use our sky subtraction method that is described below ( section 4.2 ) .      to compare the hi - selected es / sdss galaxies to an optically selected sample",
    ", we use the data release 4 ( dr4 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) `` main '' galaxy sample with @xmath16 @xmath10 17.77 mag .",
    "( strauss et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we apply a secondary cut of @xmath17 @xmath10 0.04 to ensure that a small local volume is being sampled .",
    "there are 30,236 sdss galaxies in this volume that we will use for comparison . because there were no major photometry changes between dr4 and dr2",
    ", there is no concern in comparing the dr4 data of our main comparison sample to our es / sdss sample drawn from dr2 . because of the surface brightness limit for sdss spectroscopic observations ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) , the comparison sample does not contain any galaxies with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the petrosian surface brightness ( within the 50% radius ) .",
    "the comparison sample serves two distinct purposes : 1 ) to highlight the fact that an hi - selected sample selects a different subset of galaxies than are available in the sdss spectroscopic catalog ; and 2 ) to compare the properties of an optically - selected sample to those of an hi - selected sample .",
    "the latter requires that we constrain our comparisons to galaxies that fall within the same volume .",
    "there are 51 es / sdss galaxies and 18,379 sdss `` main '' galaxies in the overlapping volume .",
    "the catalog matching began by searching the dr2 tsobj files for all sdss sources within 10@xmath20 of the es source positions .",
    "a web - page showing the field for each matching sdss object was created and all candidate objects were sorted by inverse object size ( large to small ) to ease visual inspection . over 1.16 million sdss objects were found inside the beam areas of 310 es sources that fell within the sdss dr2 footprint . at every es source position , the candidate sdss objects were visually inspected and potential counterpart galaxies identified .    to be included in the es / sdss sample , each candidate galaxy had to meet 4 criteria : 1 ) the es recessional velocity must agree to within twice the @xmath21 value of the optically derived redshift ; 2 ) there must be no more than 1 detectable , spatially resolved galaxy within the es beam at the same redshift ; 3 ) the candidate galaxy must not extend across two or more sdss fields ; and 4 ) all galaxies must be at least 1@xmath20 away from any saturated foreground stars .",
    "to apply the first criterion , we obtained a redshift for each candidate galaxy .",
    "sdss spectra and redshifts were available for @xmath580% of the candidate galaxies .",
    "for the remaining candidates , we searched the ned database and acquired redshifts for all but @xmath22 galaxies .",
    "the remaining sources were spectroscopically observed using the apache point observatory s ( apo ) arc 3.5 m telescope from february 2002 to july 2003 .",
    "all of the sources were observed with long integrations ( @xmath23 minutes ) on the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) with a 1.5@xmath24 slit and with the high resolution gratings ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "most of the galaxies in the es / sdss sample are currently forming stars and have emission lines that can be unambiguously identified and easily measured for accurate redshift determination .",
    "most of the galaxies have hi and optical recessional velocities that match to within half of the hi line width ( see fig .",
    "10 of garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "2009 ) . after obtaining redshifts for all of the candidate sources , _ all _ 310 es sources in the dr2 footprint",
    "had sdss galaxies within the es beam at the same redshift .    of these 310 galaxies , 90 failed the second criterion due to multiple sdss galaxies within a single es beam .",
    "some of the hi detections had as many as 5 galaxies at the same redshift , making it impossible to assign an hi mass to an individual galaxy . with multiple galaxies in the es beam , only the total hi of the group is measured , and without higher resolution 21 cm observations , this problem can not be resolved .",
    "this may introduce a bias against galaxies in higher density regions when determining the hi mass function from the combined es / sdss sample .    at the time of sample selection ,",
    "no techniques were available to accurately obtain the photometry for galaxies with flux spread over multiple fields .",
    "twenty of the galaxies were positioned in such a way and/or had angular extents so large that they fell over multiple sdss fields ( criterion # 3 ) and were therefore excluded from our catalog .",
    "this selection criteria also introduces a bias against the largest nearby galaxies .",
    "five additional galaxies were removed because of their close proximity to saturated foreground stars ( criterion # 4 ) whose scattered light would greatly effect galaxy photometry . since the superposition of stars in front of galaxies is random , this criterion should not introduce any additional bias .    the resulting es / sdss sample consists of the 195 galaxies that passed all four criteria .",
    "their survey names , central sdss positions , other catalog names , and morphological types from ned can be found in table [ names ] .",
    "the position centers are those used for photometry .",
    "we refer to objects both in the text and in tables by their es ( hipeq ) catalog name .",
    "because of the limits of the es survey , the hi - selected sample probes only the very nearby universe .",
    "figure [ zdist ] shows the redshift distribution of the hi - selected galaxies ( solid ) with the redshift distribution of a volume - limited sample of sdss galaxies ( dotted ) from the dr4 main galaxy sample .",
    "the galaxies in the hi - selected sample are clearly biased toward very small distances , compared to the galaxies included in most sdss studies .",
    "although this means that the hi - selected sample probes a smaller volume than other sdss studies , the volume it samples is more complete because it includes substantial low surface brightness and low luminosity populations ( although the sample is still missing gas - free galaxies eliminated by the selection criteria ) .    many measured recessional velocities are likely to be influenced by infall toward virgo .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with h@xmath25=70 km  s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath26=0.3 and @xmath27=0.7 and then correct recessional velocities for virgo infall using the idl routine v_converter , which derives velocity corrections from the leda database ( theureau et al .",
    "1998 ; terry et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the velocities are then converted into redshifts and luminosity distance .",
    "the adopted distances can be found in table [ table : derive ] .",
    "sdss photometry of large galaxies is non - trivial . in almost every sdss galaxy study to date ,",
    "large , nearby galaxies have been purposefully avoided because of the challenge in correctly extracting their photometric quantities .",
    "problems with deblending and sky subtraction preclude an automated catalog - level analysis of large galaxies , and the inclination problems in the petrosian quantities derived by sdss adversely affect the photometry of both large and small galaxies ( bailin & harris 2008 ) . in this section we discuss the limitations of sdss photometry and outline the methods used to remedy the situation .",
    "we then apply these techniques to derive photometry for the es / sdss sample .        for each galaxy in the es / sdss sample , we downloaded all atlas images within a 5@xmath20 radius of the galaxy center .",
    "we visually inspected each atlas image and identified the children that belonged to the es / sdss galaxy .",
    "for the most part , the appropriate children were easy to identify because of their uniform colors and extended morphology .",
    "in a few cases however , confusion between an hii region and a foreground star made the choice difficult . in these cases , we examined the colors of the star - like objects and included them as children if they fell off the stellar locus as defined by covey et al .",
    "the for likely parts of the galaxies were saved , and the corresponding images were mosaicked together to reconstruct an image uncontaminated by stars .",
    "the reconstructed image was visually inspected to ensure that it did not have significant missing children and that bright stars and their artifacts were not included in the reconstructed images .    to properly reconstruct the images of the galaxies with their original sky",
    ", we used the tsobj , fpatlas , fpbin and fpfieldstat sdss files to rebuild corrected frames ( fpc files ) from a specified list of atlas images .",
    "the resulting images contain only the galaxy superimposed on a restored image of the sky .",
    "we also reconstructed single galaxy fpc files and sky images for every field .",
    "the latter were useful in correcting for the error in the sdss sky subtraction ( see section 4.2 below ) .",
    "finally , we aligned all five sdss bands to the same pixel coordinates and made cut - outs of each galaxy while preserving the astrometric ( and other header ) information .",
    "twelve of the galaxies in the sample were so badly deblended by photo that they could not be easily reconstructed from their deblended children .",
    "instead , we created a sky - subtracted fpc file of the deblended parent galaxy . to remove the stars from the atlas images",
    ", we masked out the bright stars and filled in the masked regions by interpolating from surrounding pixels .",
    "as outlined above , sky subtraction errors for large galaxies can be larger than 1 magnitude in the sdss catalog data .",
    "these errors are significant and must be avoided for the large galaxies ( area @xmath28 ) that dominate our sample .",
    "to subtract the sky from our images , we followed the procedure outlined below .",
    "we ran sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on an @xmath9-band subregion of a corrected frame(fpc file ) to identify sources and masked all non - sky pixels , growing masks where needed to eliminate all galaxy flux from sky regions .",
    "then we fit a tilted plane to the remaining sky pixels and subtracted the tilted plane fit from the reconstructed galaxy image .",
    "we repeated this procedure for all 5 bands ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath9 , @xmath31 , @xmath17 ) using the masks derived from the @xmath9-band subregion .",
    "many of the sources in our catalog have very low surface brightness , making their photometry particularly sensitive to errors in sky subtraction . unlike random errors due to dark current and poisson noise , errors in sky determination lead to systematic over or under - subtraction of flux from every pixel in a galaxy image .",
    "thus , errors in the sky level do not average to zero over a galaxy image , and instead can be a major source of uncertainty , particularly for large and/or low surface brightness galaxies . in this section",
    "we explore various methods of calculating the sky background and show that almost all of the methods return similar results .",
    "we used the differences among sky subtraction techniques to characterize the uncertainty in determining the sky background .",
    "we selected a sparsely populated field from the sdss on which to test various sky subtraction methods .",
    "we tested twelve different methods using the combination of three different sky field cutouts and four different parameterizations for the shape of the sky background surface fits , ranging from first - order ( i.e. a tilted plane ) to fourth - order ( i.e. a fourth order polynomial in x and y ) respectively .",
    "the different sky fields are : 1 ) an sdss field ( 13@xmath32 ) with all of the objects masked out ; 2 ) an sdss field with all of the objects masked out and the mask of hipeq0014 - 00 ( a medium / large sized galaxy in the sample with an area of 1.4 arcmin@xmath4 ) superimposed on the field .",
    "this additional masking leaves a large `` hole '' in the image at the galaxy location , adding uncertainty to the fitting procedure ; and 3 ) a 4@xmath33 subregion of an sdss field with all of the objects masked out and the mask of hipeq0014 - 00 superimposed on the cutout .",
    "each of the twelve methods was run on all 5 bands of the sparsely populated sdss test image .    to quantify the differences among the various methods , we calculated the average residual counts per pixel in the area under the hipeq0014 - 00 mask corresponding to the area where galaxy photometry would be measured .",
    "we assumed that a perfect sky subtraction yields a mean residual sky level of zero .",
    "thus , any non - zero mean sky level is a measure of the sky subtraction uncertainty , and is reported as the residual .",
    "this analysis adequately reproduces the manner in which actual sky subtraction of a galaxy field is calculated and assesses the relevant residuals that affect galaxy photometry .",
    "the maximum residual in any of the 5 bands is 0.1 counts / pixel and the rms is 0.04 counts / pixel . for an @xmath34 @xmath35 galaxy with an aperture area of 4@xmath36 , a residual of 0.1 count / pixel results in a 0.01@xmath37 change . for comparison , a residual of 1 count / pixel would result in a 0.2@xmath37 change for the same galaxy . the residuals show no clear trend with either the fit order or the area schema .",
    "however , the @xmath31-band data have systematically larger residuals while the @xmath17-band s are systematically smaller .",
    "this may be due to faint red objects that are unidentified in the @xmath9 band , detected in @xmath31 and marginally detected in @xmath17 ( which is substantially shallower than @xmath31 ) .",
    "these objects would not be properly removed using the @xmath9-band masks .",
    "all of the methods have residuals are that well below other per pixel uncertainties that will be described below ( e.g. the dark variance varies between 0.9 and 3.9 counts / pixel ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that choosing any of these methods will not have an effect of more than @xmath38 on the resulting photometry .    for the photometry presented in this study , we have adopted a tilted plane fit to a subregion of the sdss field for the sky subtraction .",
    "this approach is the computationally fastest method and , although the @xmath17-band residual is slightly worse than other methods , the deviation is still not significant .",
    "for completeness we use the largest absolute residual in each band ( regardless of method ) as a measure of the uncertainty in the sky value .",
    "this is added to the uncertainty analysis described below .",
    "we note that the sdss residual ( defined as the mean difference between the sdss sky and the method presented in this paper ) for es / sdss galaxy hipeq0014 - 00 is @xmath51.13 counts / pixel , demonstrating the improvement made over the sdss pipeline sky subtraction .",
    "the improved sky subtraction changes the @xmath9-band magnitude of hipeq0014 - 00 by 0.19 magnitudes .",
    "the reconstructed sky subtracted galaxy images were run through two different model fitting routines to quantify the galaxies sizes , surface brightnesses , and orientations .",
    "both fitting routines use the levenberg - marquardt ( lm ) minimization technique to calculate a two - dimensional surface fit to a galaxy image .",
    "the first routine fits a single srsic ( 1968 ) profile and the second fits a two component , double exponential disk .",
    "all fits were performed on the @xmath9-band images .",
    "if the fit was able to accurately reproduce the galaxy image , then an elliptical aperture was used for subsequent photometry .",
    "47 of the galaxies were not well fit by this simple profile because of their irregular morphologies and/or low surface brightnesses .",
    "for the irregular and lsb galaxies the parameters are not reliable and a default circular aperture is used for photometry . although the lack of seeing in the models may introduce a small amount of uncertainty into the exact srsic profile derived , it has almost no effect on the aperture shape      in this section , we discuss the derivation of petrosian quantities for the es / sdss sample .",
    "petrosian ( 1976 ) photometry recovers a nearly constant fraction of a galaxy s flux for a variety of morphological types and surface brightness profiles .",
    "the resulting photometry has fewer biases than those that estimate the total galaxy flux with apertures based on isophotes or fractions of the central surface brightness .",
    "a modified petrosian photometric system has been adopted by sdss ( see blanton et al .",
    "2001 ; yasuda et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "petrosian quantities were adopted for this study to be consistent with sdss photometry , allowing us to compare our results to the greater sdss sample .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline uses circular apertures to extract petrosian quantities .",
    "however , this produces a significant inclination dependence in some of the resulting photometric quantities ( bailin & harris 2008 ) . this bias is worse in our sample than the main sdss sample because the es / sdss galaxies are sufficiently nearby that their inclinations are unaffected by seeing ( which tends to circularize angularly small galaxies )",
    "we have remedied this problem by allowing for elliptical apertures in our petrosian photometric pipeline . for the galaxies with high quality srsic fits , we adapted the sdss photometric methods to include elliptically shaped photometric apertures",
    ". we also measured every galaxy with a circular aperture for comparison with standard sdss outputs .",
    "these circular measurements were adopted for galaxies whose srsic fits were of poor quality .",
    "the first step in deriving petrosian quantities was to calculate the petrosian radius .",
    "following the sdss prescription , we defined the petrosian ratio @xmath39 as :    @xmath40}{\\int_{0}^{r } dr^ { ' } 2 \\pi r^ { ' } i(r^{'})/(\\pi r^2)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile .",
    "we performed the integration by taking 1 pixel steps and calculating the subsequent petrosian ratio at every pixel from the galaxy center . in the sdss pipeline ,",
    "the petrosian radius @xmath42 is defined as the radius at which @xmath43 is equal to 0.2 ( see blanton et al .",
    "2001 , yasuda et al .",
    "2001 ) . the petrosian flux @xmath44 in any band was then defined as the flux within 2.0 petrosian radii :    @xmath45    our method differs from the sdss method in that we use elliptical apertures , in addition to the standard sdss circular apertures .    to correctly measure colors of the galaxies , the magnitude determination for all five bands must use the same aperture .",
    "mimicking sdss , we used the derived @xmath9-band aperture for all bands .",
    "in some cases the petrosian radius was so large that the derived aperture ( @xmath46 ) far exceeded the observed boundaries of the galaxy . in these cases ,",
    "large amounts of sky pixels were included in the galaxy flux .",
    "although , in the ideal case , the summation of all sky pixels is zero , we know from section 4.2 that small residuals exist , and thus , as petrosian radius increases , so does the error from the sky subtraction residuals . due to their uncertain , irregular surface brightness profiles , most of the cases where the petrosian radius was exceedingly large were lsb galaxies .",
    "the resulting flux errors were particularly large for these systems because the integrated sky subtraction residuals can be a large fraction of the total galaxy flux .",
    "a similar problem is present in the sdss photometric pipeline ( lupton , private communication ) .",
    "sdss corrects for this by using the statistically defined edges of atlas images as the maximum possible photometric boundaries .",
    "we imposed a similar maximum size for the petrosian radius using the masks created in sky subtraction for each @xmath9-band image as the photometric boundaries ( since the aperture is applied to all 5 bands , this does not affect the measured color of the galaxies ) . for most of the galaxies ,",
    "the integration of petrosian magnitudes rarely reached the mask boundaries , indicating that the galaxy flux was correctly masked out in the sky determination .",
    "the only galaxies that reached the mask boundary were the very lsb galaxies , whose petrosian radii were not well defined ( 29% of the es / sdss sample ) .",
    "typically , the resulting flux errors from this were only 1 - 2% and were propagated into the reported magnitude uncertainties .",
    "once a petrosian flux was calculated , we converted all fluxes to asinh magnitudes ( lupton , gunn & szalay 1999 ) using the relation :    @xmath47\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the softening parameter ( a constant for each filter ) and @xmath49 is given by :    @xmath50    here the @xmath51 is the magnitude zeropoint , measured for each field , @xmath52 is the extinction coefficient in magnitudes , and @xmath53 is the standard sdss value of 53.907456 seconds .",
    "the values for @xmath54 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 were all pulled from the corresponding tsfield files .",
    "asinh magnitudes were computed for both the elliptical and circular apertures .",
    "the resulting magnitudes can be found in table [ table : paper ] .",
    "if a galaxy s profile was not well fit by an elliptical aperture , then the petrosian circular aperture magnitude was included in table [ table : paper ] .    for most of the galaxies in the es / sdss sample ,",
    "the main contribution to the photometric uncertainty was dominated by the poisson noise of the subtracted sky .",
    "the poisson variable for ccd photometry is @xmath55 .",
    "we converted from counts to photo_electrons using the following relation :    @xmath56    where the @xmath57 is a variable quantity that is also stored for each filter in each field in the tsfield files .",
    "the photometric uncertainty was then derived to be :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the galaxy flux in counts , @xmath60 is the integrated sky flux in the object aperture , @xmath61 is the number of pixels in the object aperture , @xmath62 is a combination of the dark current and the read noise per pixel that was found in the tsfield files and significantly varies from field to field and filter to filter .",
    "the @xmath63 term is the maximum residual from sky subtraction in each of the five band passes .",
    "the uncertainties from eq . 7 ( in counts )",
    "were then converted to magnitudes using eq .",
    "4 . in most cases",
    "the @xmath64 term dominates the total uncertainty .",
    "variations in extinction , cosmic redshift and sdss field boundaries can lead to significant offsets in the observed colors and magnitudes of galaxies .",
    "thus , various photometric corrections need to be made to responsibly use the aforementioned photometry for science . in this section",
    "we outline the photometric corrections that are important for the es / sdss sample .",
    "of the 195 galaxies in the hi - selected sample , 34 galaxies are close to the edge of an sdss field , but were included in the sample because the majority of their light falls within the sdss field .",
    "the flux lost beyond the edge boundary should not drastically affect the color of a galaxy , but it can change the derived absolute magnitude .",
    "the srsic fit models can be used to make a reasonable estimate of the flux lost across the field edge .    to correct for the missing flux we overlaid the srsic models for each of the 34 galaxies and masked out any regions that overlapped ( leaving only model flux that crosses the sdss field boundaries ) . using the same petrosian apertures described in section 4.4 , we calculated the flux remaining from the srsic models and converted this additional flux to a magnitude correction",
    ". only 23 of the 34 galaxies had any significant flux ( @xmath65 0.01 magnitudes ) that was lost across the field edge and most of the corrections are smaller than 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "because the srsic models are only calculated in the @xmath9-band , we assume that a similar fraction of flux is lost in the other bands and use the @xmath9-band value as a universal magnitude correction .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for small corrections but may be incorrect for larger amounts of lost flux in galaxies with large color gradients .",
    "the values for the edge correction are included in table [ table : photcor ] .",
    "the photometric magnitudes listed in table [ table : paper ] are not corrected for either extinction from the milky way or internal extinction from the extragalactic object itself .",
    "the former is provided by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ; sfd ) , using dust maps of the milky way .",
    "the sdss database provides the extinction values in all five bands at every sdss pointing .",
    "the sfd extinction values are given in table [ table : photcor ] .",
    "the correction for a galaxy s internal extinction is more complicated .",
    "the literature gives examples of extinction corrections that have been applied on the basis of hubble type ( gavazzi & boselli 1996 ) , rotation speed ( tully et al . 1998 ) , and a type - independent `` sandwich - model '' ( matthews et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we followed the method of tully et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and calculated the internal extinction of a face - on galaxy in the @xmath66-band ( @xmath67 ) , using the equation :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is set to the inclination corrected @xmath21 derived in garcia - appadoo et al .",
    "several of the galaxies do not have well - measured axis ratios and thus do not have well measured inclinations , making the appropriate value of @xmath70 uncertain .",
    "an inclination of 60 degrees ( the average inclination in a randomly aligned sample ) was assigned to all of these galaxies .",
    "the total extinction correction for the inclined galaxy was then calculated from @xmath67 using :    @xmath71    where @xmath15 is the axis ratio of the galaxy calculated from the srsic fits described section 4.3 .",
    "we converted the @xmath66 band extinction to the sdss bands using the relations in schlegel et al .",
    "the extinction values relative to @xmath66-band for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath9 , @xmath31 , and @xmath17 are : 2.66 , 1.95 , 1.42 , 1.07 , and 0.763 respectively . many of the calculated extinction values for galaxies with uncertain axis ratios were negative and all of them had values below 0.09 magnitudes in the @xmath66-band .",
    "these were converted to 0 before being applied to the galaxy photometry .",
    "the extinction values computed for galaxies with uncertain inclinations are therefore unlikely to have produced significant errors in the final photometry .",
    "these galaxies are primarily very blue , low surface brightness systems with low metallicities , and are unlikely to have large dust components .",
    "all of the internal extinction values are included in table [ table : photcor ] .      although this sample of galaxies is nearby , @xmath72-corrections are small but important for precise photometry of the more distant galaxies in the sample .",
    "we used blanton et al.s ( 2003b ) kcorrect_v3.2 to @xmath72-correct all of the galaxies in the sample to @xmath17=0 .",
    "these corrections are included in table [ table : photcor ] . the median and the maximum @xmath9-band k - corrections are 0.008 and 0.031 respectively .",
    "for the @xmath29-band , the median and maximum k - corrections are more important at 0.012 and 0.070 respectively .",
    "in addition to providing a measurement of flux , petrosian quantities can be used to calculate robust measurements of size and surface brightness . in this section , we describe the method used to derive these quantities .    once a petrosian flux was measured ( see above ) , we computed the 50% ( r50 ) and 90% ( r90 ) radii for both the elliptical apertures and circular apertures .",
    "these values correspond to the petror50 and petror90 parameters in the sdss tsobj files .",

    "the r50 and r90 values correspond to 1.668 and 3.816 times the scale length respectively .",
    "for a de vaucouleurs model the r50 and r90 correspond to 0.7124 and 2.387 times the effective half - light radius ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the petrosian flux and sizes can be used to compute surface brighteness for each galaxy .",
    "the petrosian surface brightness is the average surface brightness within r50 , defined by taking half of the petrosian flux and dividing by the elliptical aperture area with a semi - major axis equal to the elliptical r50 . for galaxies with well defined elliptical apertures ,",

    "these trends between color , luminosity and gas content are investigated in other studies ( garcia - appadoo et al .",

    "because of the way that sdss galaxies are selected for both spectroscopy and scientific analysis , most sdss studies do not include the bluest , faintest galaxies that are easily identified in an hi - selected sample .    to eliminate some of the selection effects due to sampling different volumes , we limited our comparison between the dr4 and es / sdss galaxies to those that fall within the overlap region of the two samples ( 40 mpc @xmath10 @xmath82 @xmath10 140 mpc ) .",

    "the es / sdss galaxies are both bluer ( average @xmath79 values of 0.40 versus 0.47 ; top right ) and intrinsically brighter ( @xmath81 values of -20.6 versus -19.0 ; top left ) than the dr4 sdss main galaxies in the same volume . both the properties have ks probabilities that give them a @xmath10 3% chance of the es / sdss and dr4 galaxies being pulled from the same distribution .",
    "some of the discrepancy between the distributions is due to a significant population of dwarf elliptical galaxies in the dr4 sample that have high surface brightnesses ( and thus are targeted for spectroscopy ) and have small or non - existent quantities of gas ( and are omitted from an hi - selected sample ) .",
    "in addition , the bluer @xmath79 colors in the es / sdss galaxies may be indicative of a recent burst of star formation in galaxies with a reservoir of gas ( west et al .",

    "there is a 7% chance that the histograms are pulled from the same distribution . while the sdss selection should be almost independent of axis ratio ( and therefore be fairly representative of the population ) , hi selected samples should have a slight bias towards face - on systems ( the same amount of hi flux will be distributed into fewer channels in a face - on galaxy , resulting in brighter peak flux and easier detection ) .",
    "figure [ compdr4 ] highlights an intrinsic bias in hi - selected surveys that will be important to consider for the next - generation hi - surveys like alfalfa ( giovanelli et al .",

    "the es / sdss galaxies span a large range of surface brightnesses , colors and stellar masses and as expected , the optical properties are different from those of most sdss galaxy samples ( mostly due to selection effects ) , as well as an optically selected sample compared at the sample volume . specifically , the hi selection identifies galaxies with lower surface brightness , smaller absolute magnitudes , bluer colors and smaller stellar masses than those used in typical sdss studies .",
    "hi - selected galaxies ( compared to optically selected galaxies in the same volume ) are bluer and brighter , the latter due to the abundance of dwarf elliptical galaxies in optically selected samples .",

    "<S> we present the optical data for 195 hi - selected galaxies that fall within both the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the parkes equatorial survey ( es ) . </S>",
