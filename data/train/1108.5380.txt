    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of identical bosons with contact interactions is known to be integrable since lieb and liniger have solved analytically the corresponding quantum problem by means of bethe ansatz @xcite . in the weakly interacting limit , this system can be described in the mean - field approximation by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , also known as the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) . zakharov and shabat @xcite have demonstrated that the nlse with defocusing nonlinearity ( which corresponds to the repulsive interactions between particles ) is integrable by the inverse scattering transform ( see @xcite for a general review of the inverse scattering transform method ) .",
    "since the number of integrals of motion in an integrable system equals to the number of degrees of freedom ( infinite in the continuous mean - field description @xcite or equal to the number of particles in the quantum lieb - liniger model @xcite ) , one might expect that the finally attained equilibrium state must still bear signatures of the initial conditions .",
    "one - dimensional bosonic systems have been experimentally implemented with ultra - cold atoms on atom chips @xcite , with the radial trapping frequency being @xmath0 times higher than the longitudinal one .",
    "the ultracold degenerate atomic system ( quasicondensate , i.e. a system describable by a macroscopic wave function with a fluctuating local phase ) was in the 1d regime since both the temperature and the mean interaction energy per atom were well below the energy interval between the ground and the first excited states of the radial motion .",
    "the fact that the static and dynamic correlation properties of these systems were in a very good agreement with the bose - einstein equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles seemed to be in contradiction with the system integrability and called for explanation . to explain the observed relaxation of single- and two - particle distribution functions for the elementary excitations ( bogoliubov quasiparticles ) to the bose - einstein equilibrium , a mechanism of integrability breakdown via three - body effective collisions involving virtual excitations of the radial degrees of freedom has been proposed @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we numerically show the existence of a certain case of nonequilibrium initial conditions of the gpe , which provide a very fast relaxation of the simplest ( single - particle ) observables to an equilibrium state very close to thermal equilibrium , despite the integrability of the problem .",
    "some indications of thermalization in 1d bosonic systems have been obtained in numerical simulations of various physical processes in quasicondensates , such as the subexponential decay of coherence between coherently split quasicondensates @xcite , soliton formation in a 1d bosonic system in the course of ( quasi)condensation @xcite , in - trap density fluctuations @xcite , wave chaos @xcite , and condensate formation after the addition of a dimple to a weak harmonic longitudinal confinement of a 1d ultracold atomic gas @xcite . however , a systematic study of thermalization of the gpe solution in the course of time evolution was lacking up to now .",
    "even @xcite , where thermalization of the gpe solution with the initial conditions corresponding to the high - temperature limit has been numerically obtained , states that formal and systematic understanding of the problem is still incomplete . we fill this gap , at least to a certain extent , with our present study",
    ".    we also have to draw a clear distinction between our approach and that of rigol _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who theoretically studied dephasing in a quantum system of hard - core bosons on a lattice , prepared initially in a coherent superposition of eigenstates , and its relaxation to a generalized gibbs ( fully constrained ) equilibrium . our aim is to demonstrate that a weakly interacting 1d degenerate bosonic gas can approach , in the course of its evolution , a state that is reasonably close to the conventional thermal bose - einstein equilibrium .",
