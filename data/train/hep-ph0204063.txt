    "there has been much interest recently in the framework , proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali ( add ) @xcite , which resolves the hierarchy problem by exploiting the geometry of spacetime . in this scenario , the fundamental scale of gravity in a higher @xmath2 dimensional spacetime is assumed to be of order the electroweak scale @xmath3 tev .",
    "the apparent weakness of gravity in our 4-dimensional world originates from the large volume of the additional @xmath4 spatial dimensions .",
    "the 4-dimensional planck scale is no longer a fundamental scale , leaving the electroweak scale as the ultraviolet cut - off of the low - energy effective theory .",
    "the gauge hierarchy is thus effectively eliminated and reduced to the more tractable problem of stabilizing the higher dimensional radii @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "gravity propagates throughout the higher dimensional volume , known as the bulk , whereas the standard model ( sm ) fields are confined to a @xmath5-dimensional brane , or wall .    in this theory gauss law",
    "relates the planck scale of the 4-dimensional theory , @xmath6 , to the fundamental scale of gravity , @xmath7 , through the volume of the compactified dimensions @xmath8 via @xmath9 where @xmath10 gev is the 4-d planck scale .",
    "setting @xmath11 tev then determines the compactification radius @xmath12 of the extra dimensions , with the exact relationship being set by the geometry of the compact dimensions . assuming that the extra dimensions are of toroidal form and are all of equal size , we have @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath12 then ranges from a sub - millimeter to a few fermi for @xmath14 to 6 .",
    "the case of @xmath15 is excluded as it predicts corrections to newtonian gravity at distances comparable to those in the solar system .",
    "a similar scenario can be realized in string theory where the string scale plays the role of the higher dimensional fundamental scale @xcite , with the string scale acting as the ultraviolet cut - off of the theory .",
    "proposals for the localization of sm matter and gauge fields to a @xmath16 dimensional wall have been made in the context of topological defects of higher dimensional field theories @xcite .",
    "such localization can occur naturally in string theory via d - branes where the sm particles are represented by open strings whose ends lie on the d - brane , while gravitons , which carry no gauge charges , may propagate in the bulk and correspond to closed strings @xcite .",
    "since this scenario modifies gravity at the electroweak scale , it is natural to expect the emergence of new phenomena at the tev scale which may reveal itself in experiments and lead to signatures very different from sm predictions . upon compactification",
    ", the bulk graviton expands into a kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower of states , referred to as a bulk graviton kk tower , which interact with the sm fields on the brane .",
    "collider signals for the graviton kk states have been studied by various authors @xcite , who have considered the virtual exchange of bulk graviton kaluza - klein towers , processes which radiate gravitons into the bulk , and stringy excitations of the standard model particles .",
    "data from the tevatron , lepii , and hera @xcite presently constrain @xmath17 tev for all values of @xmath4 , while the lhc and a future high energy @xmath18 linear collider are expected to probe fundamental scales in the @xmath19 tev range .",
    "astrophysical and cosmological considerations @xcite place stringent bounds , of order @xmath20 tev , for the case of @xmath14 ; these limits weaken substantially to @xmath17 tev for higher values of @xmath4 .",
    "mechanical experiments have tested the inverse - square nature of the gravitational force law down to distances of @xmath21 @xcite for the case of @xmath14 .",
    "this scenario is thus consistent with all data as long as the number of extra dimensions is greater than one , with the case of @xmath14 being disfavored in terms of being relevant to the hierarchy problem .",
    "while the original motivation for the add scenario was to solve the hierarchy problem without the introduction of low - energy supersymmetry ( or technicolor ) , one still might ask whether supersymmetry plays a role in such a scenario . clearly , bulk supersymmetry is not in conflict with the basic assumptions of the model .",
    "in fact , various reasons exist for believing in a supersymmetric bulk , not least of which is the motivation of string theory .",
    "as discussed above , d - branes of string theory provide a natural mechanism for the confinement of the sm fields . if string theory is the ultimate theory of nature then the proposal of add might be embedded within it with a supersymmetric bulk , , a bulk supporting a supersymmetric gravitational action .",
    "in addition , extra dimensional geometries have been shown to provide novel methods for breaking supersymmetry @xcite , the possibility that a supersymmetric bulk might provide a source for a tiny cosmological constant has been discussed @xcite , and supersymmetry might also serve as a mechanism for stabilizing the bulk radii .",
    "supersymmetry has also been considered in the context of warped extra dimensions present in the randall - sundrum scenario of localized gravity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the consequences of a supersymmetric bulk in the add scenario .",
    "if bulk supersymmetry remains unbroken away from the brane , then it is natural to ask what happens to the superpartners of the bulk gravitons , the gravitinos .",
    "the bulk gravitinos must also expand into a kaluza - klein tower of states and induce experimental signatures .",
    "up to now , the phenomenology of such gravitino kk states has been unexplored .",
    "the existence of a light graviphoton , which is present if there is no orbifolding , in supersymmetric add has been shown to alter the non - supersymmetric add phenomenology @xcite , and hence we also expect large effects from the gravitino sector . here ,",
    "for concreteness , we examine the virtual exchange of the bulk gravitino kk tower in superparticle pair production .",
    "we now outline the approach taken in this paper .",
    "we study the compactification of the gravitino sector of a generic supergravity theory living in the bulk and work out the form of the effective action describing the free part of the reduced action on the @xmath16 dimensional brane to which the fields of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) are assumed to be confined .",
    "we assume that supersymmetry on the wall is broken , giving rise to masses for the zero - modes of the kaluza - klein tower resulting from the reduction of the higher dimensional gravitinos , and shifting the masses of all higher modes .",
    "we make no special assumptions about the nature or origin of confinement of the mssm fields to the wall .",
    "we then derive the couplings of the kaluza - klein modes of the higher dimensional gravitinos to fermions and their scalar superpartners on the wall , yielding an effective 4-d theory which we then use to study the corrections to collider signatures of certain processes in the mssm . for purposes of illustration",
    ", we work with a @xmath22 dimensional theory ; the generality of our results should be apparent ( up to considerations of representations of fermions in various dimensions ) .",
    "the gravitino zero - mode acquires a mass from the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry on the brane , with this mass being proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the supersymmetry breaking scale in a generic model , noting that the zero - mode gravitino couples with the usual @xmath25 strength .",
    "this familiar 4-d expression can also be seen to arise from the volume factor after integrating over the @xmath4 extra dimensions and using eq .",
    "various susy breaking scenarios thus yield different predictions ranging from ultralight gravitinos from weak - scale supersymmetry breaking models , light gravitinos in gauge mediated susy breaking , and heavier gravitinos in models of gravity and anomaly mediated susy breaking .",
    "the possibility of light gravitinos is an interesting one and their generic collider @xcite and astrophysical @xcite implications have been studied , with direct collider searches yielding a bound of @xmath26 ev @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the case of gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) has been intensively studied @xcite , as a light gravitino modifies the standard collider search techniques for supersymmetry and provides a good candidate for warm dark matter @xcite . in this paper , we work in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry as it naturally affords a light gravitino state , however our results apply to any supersymmetric model with a light gravitino , including weak - scale breaking models .",
    "we focus on the effects of the virtual exchange of the bulk gravitino and graviton kk tower states in the process @xmath27 at a high energy linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "this process is well - known as a benchmark for collider supersymmetry studies @xcite , as the use of incoming polarized beams enables one to disentangle the neutralino sector and determine the degree of mixing between the various pure gaugino states .",
    "the effects of the virtual exchange of a bulk graviton kk tower in selectron pair production has been examined in @xcite for the case of non - supersymmetric large extra dimensions . here",
    ", we will see that the introduction of bulk gravitino kk exchange greatly alters the phenomenology of this process by modifying the angular distributions and by substantially increasing the magnitude of the cross section .",
    "we find that the leading order behavior for this process is given by a dimension-6 operator , in contrast to the dimension-8 operator corresponding to graviton kk exchange .",
    "this yields a tremendous sensitivity to the existence of a supersymmetric bulk , resulting in a search reach for the ultraviolet cut - off of the theory of order @xmath28 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the kaluza - klein decomposition of the gravitinos in such a model . in section 3",
    "we use the general noether technique to couple the gravitino kaluza - klein states to matter fields , and in section 4 we present the phenomenology of this scenario , pointing out some generic features of such models .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "various details are relegated to the appendices .",
    "our notation in this paper is as follows : we assume space - time possesses @xmath29 dimensions , with matter confined to a @xmath16 dimensional brane , and pure supergravity propagating also in the extra @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "letters from the greek alphabet are used to denote curved ( world ) indices while those from the latin alphabet denote flat ( tangent space ) indices .",
    "hatted symbols range over the full @xmath30 dimensions ; barred ones are restricted to the @xmath4 extra dimensions , while those without any decoration live on the @xmath16 dimensional brane .",
    "coordinates over the entire @xmath2 dimensional manifold split as @xmath31 .",
    "our minkowski metric convention is @xmath32 .",
    "we begin by reminding the reader of some general observations about string theory and supergravity in ten and eleven dimensions .",
    "recall that type iia ( ten dimensional ) supergravity with two supersymmetries of opposite chirality can be deduced via dimensional reduction of the unique 11 dimensional ( n=1 ) supergravity theory .",
    "the type iia superstring theory whose low energy effective action gives rise to the type iia supergravity admits dp - branes with p even , and is s - dual to eleven dimensional m - theory @xcite , with the eleven dimensional supergravity as its low energy limit .",
    "m - theory is believed to unify the five known string theories .",
    "the type iib string theory ( which admits dp - branes with p odd ) is t - dual to the type iia theory .",
    "d - branes are extended string theoretic objects on which open strings terminate @xcite . only closed strings can propagate far away from the d - brane , which on a ten dimensional background is described locally by a type ii string theory whose spectrum contains two gravitinos ( their vertex operators carry one vector and one spinor index ) .",
    "the d - brane introduces open string boundary conditions which are invariant under just one supersymmetry , so only a linear combination of the two original supersymmetries survives for the open strings . since open and closed strings couple to each other , the d - brane breaks the original @xmath33 supersymmetry down to @xmath34 .",
    "the low energy effective theory will then be a @xmath35 supergravity theory with a single majorana - weyl gravitino which couples to a conserved space - time supercurrent .",
    "for our model , we assume that the standard model fields are confined to a 3-brane , with pure supergravity living in the bulk of space - time",
    ". attempts at constructing a standard model on d - branes can be found in @xcite .",
