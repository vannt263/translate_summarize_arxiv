    "the coalescence of two carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs with a combined mass in excess of the chandrasekhar limit has long been considered a promising path towards a type ia supernova ( sn ia ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in the last few years , a few massive double co white dwarf systems have been found that have periods short enough for them to merge within a hubble time ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario can also easily explain the lack of hydrogen and helium lines in most sn ia spectra and the occurrence of sne ia both in old and young star - forming systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .    theoretically , the final fate of double co white dwarf mergers has been much debated .",
    "previous studies assumed that the dynamical disruption of the roche - lobe filling secondary should lead to the formation of a thick disc around the primary white dwarf ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , accretion of co - rich matter from the thick disc onto the central cold white dwarf has been studied for investigating the evolution of such mergers by many authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as accretion rates from the thick disc",
    "should be close to the eddington limit ( @xmath3 ) , most of those studies concluded that carbon ignition in the envelope of the accreting white dwarf is an inevitable consequence of such rapid accretion of co - rich matter .",
    "once carbon ignites off - center , the burning flame propagates inwards on a relatively short time scale ( @xmath4 yr ) , and the co white dwarf is transformed into an onemg white dwarf ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the mass of the onemg white dwarf approaches the chandrasekhar limit , electron capture onto ne and mg is expected to lead to the gravitational collapse of the white dwarf to a neutron star ( @xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for recent studies of such collapse ) .",
    "however , the evolution of the remnants of double co white dwarf mergers is not yet well understood .",
    "for instance , it has been debated whether the accretion rate decreases when the accreting white dwarf reaches critical rotation @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the canonical description of the merger remnant as a primary white dwarf + thick disc system is clearly an oversimplification . in previous three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also sect .",
    "[ sectsph ] ) , a large fraction of the disrupted secondary and the outermost layers of the primary form an extended hot envelope around the cold core containing most of the primary mass .",
    "the rest of the secondary mass becomes a centrifugally supported disc in the outermost layers of the merger remnant .",
    "interestingly , the merger remnant reaches a state of quasi - static equilibrium within a few minutes from the onset of the dynamical disruption of the secondary . as the structure of the cold core plus the hot envelope appears to have a fairly spheroidal shape",
    "( see below ) rather than the toroidal shape obtained with a zero - temperature equation of state @xcite , the merger remnant may be better described as a _ differentially rotating single co star _ consisting of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot extended envelope surrounded by a keplerian disc , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figmerger ] , than the previously adopted primary white dwarf + thick disc system . the further evolution of the merger must therefore be determined by the thermal cooling of the hot envelope and the redistribution of the angular momentum inside the central remnant , and accretion of matter onto the envelope from the keplerian disc .    with this new approach to the problem in mind",
    ", we here revisit both the dynamical and the secular evolution of double co white dwarf mergers . in the following section ( sect .  [ sectsph ] ) ,",
    "we present the numerical results of an sph simulation of the dynamical evolution of the coalescence of a @xmath5 wd and a @xmath6 co white dwarf up to the stage of quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium , and we carefully investigate the structure of the merger remnant . in sect .",
    "[ sectmerger ] , we construct models of the central remnant in quasi - static equilibrium state ( primary + hot extended envelope ) which mimic the sph result and calculate the thermal evolution of the merger remnant using a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code . in particular , the conditions for avoiding off - center carbon ignition are systematically explored . in sect .",
    "[ sectdiscussion ] , we conclude this work by discussing uncertainties in our assumptions , the implications for type ia supernovae and future work .",
    "before discussing the subsequent thermal evolution after the coalescence of a double co white dwarf coalescence binary , we investigate the configuration of the remnant in quasi - static equilibrium in some detail . for this purpose ,",
    "we have carried out a sph simulation of the dynamical process of the coalescence of two co white dwarfs of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . our simulation uses a 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code that is an offspring of a code developed to simulate neutron star mergers @xcite .",
    "it uses an artificial viscosity scheme with time - dependent parameters @xcite . in the absence of shocks",
    ", the viscosity parameters have a very low value ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; most sph implementations use values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) ; if a shock is detected , a source term @xcite guarantees that the parameters rise to values that are able to resolve the shock properly without spurious post - shock oscillations . to suppress artificial viscosity forces in pure shear flows",
    ", we additionally apply a switch originally suggested by @xcite .    to account for the energetic feedback onto the fluid from nuclear transmutations",
    ", we use a minimal nuclear reaction network developed by @xcite .",
    "it couples a conventional @xmath11-network stretching from he to si with a quasi - equilibrium - reduced @xmath11-network .",
    "although a set of only seven nuclear species is used , this network reproduces the energy generation of all burning stages from he - burning to nse very accurately . for details and tests",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "we use the helmholtz equation of state ( eos ) , developed by the center for astrophysical thermonuclear flashes at the university of chicago .",
    "this eos allows to freely specify the chemical composition of the gas and can be coupled to nuclear reaction networks .",
    "the electron / positron equation of state has been calculated without approximations , i.e. it makes no assumptions about the degree of degeneracy or relativity ; the exact expressions are integrated numerically to machine precision .",
    "the nuclei in the gas are treated as a maxwell - boltzmann gas , the photons as blackbody radiation .",
    "the eos is used in tabular form with densities ranging from @xmath12 and temperatures from @xmath13 to @xmath14 k. a sophisticated , biquintic hermite polynomial interpolation is used to enforce thermodynamic consistency ( i.e. the maxwell - relations ) at interpolated values @xcite .",
    "we use a maccormack predictor - corrector method ( e.g. @xcite ) with individual particle time steps to evolve the fluid . with our standard parameters for the tree - opening criterion and the integration , this time marching implementation conserves the total energy to better than @xmath15 and the total angular momentum to better than @xmath16 . note that this could , in principle , be improved even further by taking into account the so - called `` grad - h''-terms @xcite and extra - terms arising from adapting gravitational smoothing terms @xcite .    to avoid numerical artifacts",
    ", we only use equal mass sph particles .",
    "for the initial conditions , we therefore stretch a uniform particle distribution according to a function that has been derived from solving the 1d stellar structure equations .",
    "this technique is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "this particle setup is then further relaxed with an additional damping force ( e.g. @xcite ) so that the particles can settle into their true equilibrium configuration .",
    "the calculations are performed with @xmath17 sph particles , a much larger particle number than could be afforded by previous calculations , and run up to a much longer evolutionary time ( 5 minutes ) than previous calculations ( see table  [ tabsph ] ) .    figs .",
    "[ figcoels1 ] and  [ figcoels2 ] show the dynamical evolution of the merging process of the double white dwarf system considered in this study .",
    "the panel in the left columns show the densities and the panel in the right columns the temperatures ( in units of @xmath18 k ) in the orbital plane . the secondary is completely disrupted within 1.7 minutes , and mass accretion onto the primary induces local heating near the surface of the primary .",
    "[ figtmax ] shows the evolution of the maximum temperature as a function of time .",
    "the peak in temperature reaches @xmath19 at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 marks the moment when the simulation starts .",
    "carbon ignites when @xmath22 , but nuclear burning is quenched soon due to the local expansion of the hottest region , as is also observed in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the total amount of energy released due to nuclear burning is about @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite considered the same initial white dwarf masses as in the present study .",
    "but they adopted the original artificial viscosity prescription of @xcite , which is known to introduce spurious forces in shear flows , and they did not include nuclear burning ( table  [ tabsph ] ) . by the end of their calculation ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 reached @xmath26 , while in our simulation , it decreases to @xmath26 only when @xmath27 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath25 decreases further afterwards in our calculation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtmax ] , and reaches a steady value at @xmath28 when @xmath29 . in the other calculations by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the dynamical evolution of the merger was not followed for more than 2 minutes either , and we can not directly compare our results to theirs .",
    "however , we suspect that @xmath25 would also decrease further in the systems they considered if they had continued their calculations for a longer evolutionary time . it should also be noted that energy dissipation by artificial viscosity might lead to overheating , and that thermal diffusion  which may play an important role in the outermost layers  is not considered in the present study .",
    "it is thus likely that @xmath25 in the quasi - static equilibrium state may be even lower in reality than in our simulation .",
    "[ figquasiequi ] shows the structure of the merger remnant at quasi - static equilibrium .",
    "the central region with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) has a fairly spheroidal shape , and a centrifugally supported disc appears at @xmath32 where the angular velocity is close to the keplerian value .",
    "the fraction of the secondary mass contained in the keplerian disc is larger in our simulation ( about 67% ) than in @xcite ( about 41 % ) .",
    "the innermost core ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ) is essentially isothermal , and the temperature has its peak value ( @xmath35 ) at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the disc material extends over @xmath38 along the @xmath39-axis as the temperature is still high ; if thermal diffusion were included , the disc would become much thinner on a short time scale of a few hours .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fign0.9 ] that the local peak of temperature is located where the compressional heating rate begins to dominate over the thermal diffusion rate ( @xmath137 ) , as expected .",
    "the neutrino cooling rate also increases as the temperature in the envelope becomes higher , but nuclear energy generation becomes significant before neutrino cooling dominates the thermal evolution , inducing a carbon - burning flash around @xmath138 .",
    "as table  [ tabacc ] shows , and consistent with the findings of @xcite , such off - center carbon flashes occur regardless of the initial mass of the white dwarf , if @xmath139 .",
    "the results with models including rotation show that carbon ignition may be delayed if the effect of rotation is included ( table  [ tabacc ] ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that the local effective mass accretion rate ( @xmath140 ) inside the white dwarf at a given mass is lower because of the centrifugal force .",

    "[ figmdotr0.9 ] .",
    "however , carbon ignition occurs well before the white dwarf reaches the chandrasekhar limit , in all model sequences considered .",
    "thus , rotation by itself can not change the conclusion of the previous work that the coalescence of double co white dwarfs should lead to accretion - induced collapse rather than a thermonuclear explosion , unless the accretion rate is significantly lowered , as was also shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "having understood the physics of the thermal evolution of co white dwarfs which accrete cold matter with a rate close to the eddington limit , we now investigate the evolution of the central remnant model consisting of a cold core and a hot envelope as described in sect .",
    "[ sectmethod ] .",
    "first , we examine the results of the model sequences where both angular - momentum loss and mass accretion from the keplerian disc are neglected ( i.e. , @xmath146 and @xmath147 ; seqs  sa1 , aa1 , ab1 , ac1 , ad1 , ae1 , ba1 , & ta1 ) .",
    "[ figsa1]a illustrates the evolution of the central remnant for @xmath110 in seq .",

    "note that the local peak of temperature at @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) is significantly below the critical temperature for carbon ignition ( @xmath150 ; dotted curve in fig  [ figsa1]a ) .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsa1]b that the local effective accretion rate ( @xmath151 ) remains relatively high ( @xmath152 ) around @xmath153 , where the local peak of temperature is located , for about 5000 yrs .",
    "despite such high effective accretion rates , the temperature peak continuously decreases , although the inner core becomes somewhat hotter due to compression , and the central remnant finally becomes a cold white dwarf .",
    "a few remarkable differences compared to the standard accreting white dwarf models are found in this regard .",
    "firstly , since the envelope is very hot , neutrino cooling  in particular by photoneutrinos  is significant from the beginning , and even dominant over the thermal diffusion at the interface between the core and the envelope as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsa1]c . in",
    "cold - matter accreting white dwarfs , neutrino cooling becomes important only after a significant amount of mass has been accreted ( fig .",
    "[ fign0.9 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the compressional heating rate is slightly lower than the neutrino cooling rate around the local peak of temperature . as the contraction of the central remnant",
    "is mainly determined by the thermal evolution of the envelope , the local accretion rate is in fact controlled by the cooling process .",
    "this explains why we have @xmath154 around the local peak of temperature for the initial @xmath155 yrs , and why the local peak of temperature continuously decreases despite the relatively high effective accretion rate .",
    "this conclusion is the same for all other sequences with a @xmath156 that is significantly lower than @xmath150 ( seq .",
    "aa1 , ab1 , & ba1 ) including the non - rotating case ( seq .",

    "we find that , in seq .",
    "sa1 , the differentially rotating layers at the interface between the core and the envelope in the initial central remnant model are stable against the dynamical shear instability ( dsi ) .",
    "they are , however , unstable to the dsi in other sequences , where the interface is more degenerate ( see yl04 for discussions on the dsi ) .",
    "consequently , in seq .",
    "aa1 for example , the rate of rotational energy dissipation ( @xmath157 ) appears to be very high initially ( fig .",
    "[ figomegaa ] ) .",
    "the differentially rotating layers are rapidly smeared out by the dynamical shear instability ( see the discussion in sect .  2 in yl04 ) , and @xmath157 falls below the thermal diffusion and/or neutrino cooling rate only within 20 yrs .",
    "hence we conclude that the rotational energy dissipation does not play an important role for the long - term evolution of the central remnant .",
    "[ figrhotac1 ] shows how the evolution of the central remnant changes if the local peak of temperature in the initial model ( @xmath62 ) is close to or above the critical limit for carbon burning ( @xmath150 ) , with seqs  ac1 and ae1 as examples .",
    "in contrast to seq .",
    "sa1 or aa1 , carbon burning dominates the evolution very soon in both sequences , and the temperature increases rapidly .",
    "although the further evolution has not been followed in the present study , it is most likely that the carbon - burning flame propagates inward such that the central remnant is converted into an onemg white dwarf within several thousand years as shown by @xcite .",
    "as summarized in table  [ tabmerger ] , all other sequences follow the same evolutionary pattern : off - center carbon ignition is avoided in seqs ab1 , ba1 , and ta1 where @xmath62 is significantly below @xmath150 , while carbon ignites off - center in the other sequences where @xmath158 .",
    "it is thus remarkable that the thermal evolution of the central remnant is sensitively determined by the local peak of temperature in the quasi - static equilibrium state .    in conclusion , in the absence of angular - momentum loss and mass accretion from the keplerian disc , the thermal evolution of the central remnant is roughly controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the envelope , and off - center carbon burning may be avoided as long as @xmath159 , while it seems inevitable if @xmath158 .",

    "sa5 where @xmath161 .",

    "the thermal history of the central remnant in those sequences where carbon ignites off - center is similar to that of the white dwarf in classical accretion model sequences .",

    "the critical accretion rate for inducing off - center carbon ignition is thus difficult to precisely determine , as our 1-d models significantly underestimate the effect of the centrifugal force , especially in the envelope where carbon ignites .",
    "in addition , the physics of angular momentum loss / gain is not well understood yet , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath66 in seqs aa10 , ba6 and ba7 is already very close , or even above the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "however , the central density in those models is still smaller by an order of magnitude than the critical limit for carbon ignition due to the effect of rotation .",
    "as the carbon - burning flame will propagate inwards within several thousand years @xcite , only about @xmath178 may be further accreted by the time the burning flame reaches the center , and the central density may not become high enough to induce a thermonuclear explosion before the whole central remnant is converted into an onemg white dwarf .",

    "the outcome in these cases is thus the formation of a ( super- ) chandrasekhar mass co white dwarf , which will eventually explode as a type ia supernova .",

    "we have explored the dynamical and secular evolution of the merger of double co white dwarf binaries whose total mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit . based on our new sph simulation of the coalescence of two co white dwarfs of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we suggest that the immediate post - merger remnant is best described as a differentially rotating co star consisting of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope that is surrounded by a keplerian disc rather than as  cold white dwarf + thick disc \" system , as in previous investigations .",

    "[ fign0.9 ] and  [ figsa4 ] , the detailed structure of the rapidly rotating outermost layers above the interface may not significantly affect our results on the thermal evolution of the merger remnant , as long as the angular momentum of the envelope is not lost faster than the local neutrino cooling time scale at the interface .",
    "on the other hand , mass accretion from the keplerian disc should occur preferentially along the equatorial plane of the envelope . as shown in the sph simulation ,",
    "the envelope is more extended along the equatorial plane , where most angular momentum is deposited , than along the polar axis , and the resultant compressional heating must be much weakened , compared to the case of our 1-d models . the enhanced role of rotation must thus help to increase the critical mass accretion rate for inducing off - center carbon ignition , in favor of producing a type ia supernova .    we have concluded that the loss of angular momentum on a short time scale ( @xmath193 ) may induce off - center carbon ignition even when @xmath170 .",
    "rapidly rotating compact stars may experience loss of angular momentum by gravitational wave radiation , due to either the bar - mode instability or the r - mode instability .",

    "therefore , the role of magnetic fields in the merger evolution remains uncertain at the current stage and is a challenging subject for future work .",
    "the coalescence of more massive double co white dwarf binaries is likely to result in a higher maximum temperature due to the enhanced role of gravity .",
    "consequently , given the important role of the maximum temperature in the merger remnant for its final fate , less massive binary co white dwarfs may be favored for the production of sne ia from such a channel .",
    "we note that there are number of potentially important factors that have not been included in either the present study or previous simulations .",
    "these include the following points :    1 .",
    "the previous and present simulations assumed that white dwarfs are cold prior to the merging process .",
    "however , @xcite point out that tidal interactions might heat up the white dwarfs as the orbit shrinks , which could weaken the gravitational potential of the primary . furthermore , as the temperature of white dwarfs is a function of their age , younger progenitors should have more extended envelopes , which may result in a lower @xmath62 .",
    "2 .   a thin hydrogen / helium envelope must be present initially in both the primary and the secondary . as hydrogen or helium",
    "should ignite at a much lower temperature than carbon , the influence of the release of nuclear energy during the merger process may be even more important than shown in the existing sph simulations , which is likely to lower @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , neutrino losses , which were neglected in the present study , would also tend to reduce @xmath62 .",
    "3 .   at a given total mass ( @xmath202 ) , different mass ratios of the white dwarf components ( @xmath203 ) must result in different merger structures .",
    "4 .   a lower @xmath204 at a given @xmath205 may not only lead to a stronger gravitational potential of the primary , but also to a lower mass accretion rate during the dynamical mass transfer @xcite . as the former and the latter will tend to increase and decrease @xmath62 , respectively , quantitative studies are necessary to predict how @xmath62 will change with @xmath204 .",
    "finally , another important ingredient that needs to be considered is thermal diffusion during the dynamical evolution . as shown above , the mass - accretion rate from the keplerian disc onto the envelope of the central remnant is one of the most important factors that critically determine the final fate of double co white dwarf mergers .",
    "the accretion rates depend on the structure of the keplerian disc at thermal equilibrium , which can be only understood by including thermal diffusion in future simulations .",
    "but here we emphasize again that the accretion rates from a centrifugally supported keplerian disc should be significantly lower than those from a pressure - supported thick disc that was previously assumed , which opens the possibility for at least some double co white dwarf mergers to produce sne ia .",
