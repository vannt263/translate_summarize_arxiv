    "one fundamental element to study ultrarelativistic collisions is the characterization of the interaction in terms of bulk variables such as the transverse energy and the number of charged particles .",
    "these variables are closely related to the collision geometry and are important in understanding global properties of the system during the collision .",
    "this paper presents the first study of @xmath0 at mid- and forward - rapidity and @xmath1 measured at @xmath3  tev by the alice experiment .",
    "the centrality dependence of these observables is characterized by the number of participants n@xmath4 , determined with a glauber model of pb - pb collisions and is studied as a function of energy by comparing our results to those at rhic and at the sps . finally , the results are compared to the available models . charged particles @xmath5 and transverse energy @xmath6",
    "are generated by the initial scattering of the partonic constituents of the incoming nuclei and possibly also by reinteractions among the produced partons and hadrons . without significant reinteraction ,",
    "the observed transverse energy is the same as that produced by the initial scattering .",
    "the amount of the reinteraction , and therefore of the equilibration of the fireball , can be measured evaluating the decrease of the initial scattering energy . to some extent",
    "transverse hydrodynamic flow can compensate this equilibrium .",
    "however gluon saturation can delay the onset of the flow reducing the effective pressure and thereby reducing the difference in the initially produced and the observed energy .",
    "the systematic study of global event properties , in particular transverse energy , charged multiplicity and mean transverse momentum , their centrality and energy dependence , may impose significant constraints on the collision dynamics .",
    "alice has collected in the pb - pb run last year @xmath730 million events with nuclear collisions using minimum bias triggers with increasingly tigther conditions .",
    "these triggers use the vzero scintillators ( covering @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and silicon pixel detector ( spd , @xmath10)@xcite , and their efficiency ranges from 97 to 99% , as measured in simulations and dedicated pp runs taken with minimum interaction triggers",
    ". however peripheral collisions are strongly contaminated by electromagnetic ( em ) background for which the cross sections are much higher than at the lower energies measured so far .",
    "qed processes and photo - nuclear interactions , where one photon from the em field of one of the nuclei interacts with the other nucleus , possibly fluctuating to a vector meson yield soft particles at mid - rapidity @xcite . at beam rapidity",
    "the cross section is large for electromagnetic dissociation , where one or both nuclei breaks up as a consequence of the em interaction .       and @xmath11 collisions .",

    "[ fig : glau],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    hadronic processes are described in a simple geometrical picture by the glauber model , which assumes straightline nucleon trajectories and n - n cross section independent of the number of collisions the nucleons have undergone before .",
    "the nuclear density profile is given by a woods - saxon distribution .",
    "we used a nucleon - nucleon cross section , see fig .",
    "[ fig : glau ] ( left ) of 64  mb , estimated from all available measurements ( before lhc ) @xcite and now confirmed by measurements by atlas , cms and alice ones , thanks to van der meer scans @xcite and a detailed analysis of the diffractive systems @xcite .",
    "the collision geometry determines the number of nucleons that participate in the reaction , so - called number of participants n@xmath4 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : glau ] ( right ) .",
    "the definition of centrality is based on the basic assumption that the impact parameter @xmath13 is monotonically related to particle multiplicity or the energy produced at mid - rapidity .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of any of these centrality observables has a classical shape . as an example , the distribution of vzero amplitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vzeroglau ] ( left ) .",
    "the peak corresponds to most peripheral collisions ( contaminated by em background and by missing events due to the trigger efficiency ) , the plateau to the mid - central and the edge to the central collisions which results from the intrinsic fluctuations and the detector acceptance and resolution .",
    "other observables include the number of time projection chamber ( tpc , @xmath14 ) tracks and the number of spd clusters .",
    "the vzero distribution is fitted using a phenomenological approach based on the glauber monte carlo plus a convolution of a model for the particle production and a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) .",
    "it is assumed that the number of independently decaying precursor particles ( `` ancestors '' ) is given by a 2 component model @xmath15 , where @xmath16  % from the fit quantifies their relative contribution .",
    "other ancestor dependences have been tested , using power - law functions of n@xmath4 or n@xmath17 .",
    "the number of particles produced per precursor source was assumed to follow a nbd distribution .",
    "the fit is performed in a region corresponding to  88% of the total cross section to avoid the peak of contamination and inefficiency . extracting the number of participants from the glauber fit",
    "gives accesses directly to the n@xmath4 , nearly identical to the geometrical one .",
    "however it is important to remember that we use the glauber model and the ancestor assumptions only to determine the fraction of total cross section that we see , confirming the results obtained with the data - based analysis .",
    "another way to determine the centrality is to measure the energy deposited by the spectators in the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) .",
    "this in principle provides directly the number of participants , however the nuclear fragmentation breaks the simple relation in the measured variables .",
    "the zdc therefore needs to be correlated to another detector , in this case the electromagnetic calorimeter zem . since the zdc is far from the interaction point and therefore rather independent on the vertex , this centrality measure",
    "is particularly suited for the analysis that does not require any vertex cut , and it gives good results for central collisions , where the zdc signal is well correlated with the number of spectators .",
    "we evaluated the performance of the centrality determination by comparing all our estimates .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vzeroglau ] ( right ) .",
    "the figure shows the rms of the ( gaussian ) distribution of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is calculated iteratively by @xmath20 the resolution depends on the rapidity coverage of the detector used .",
    "so when scaled by the square root of the @xmath5 measured in that detector all the results line up together .",
