    "the advent of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ enables us to study the intracluster medium ( icm ) in clusters of galaxies with superb spatial resolution .",
    "_ chandra _ has revealed the dynamics of substructures in the central region of clusters . in some clusters , sharp contact surfaces between the cold gas in merging subcluster cores and the hot icm have been observed @xcite .",
    "these contact surfaces are often called ` cold fronts ' .",
    "they are interpreted as cool cores from subclusters which are moving through the main body of the cluster without losing their identity @xcite .",
    "the existence of those cold fronts also provides information about fluid dynamics , transport properties , and magnetic fields in the icm .",
    "@xcite argued that magnetic fields provide a surface tension that stabilizes the cold fronts against the development of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities .",
    "_ chandra _ has also provided more detailed information on cluster merger shocks than the previous observations with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for abell  665",
    ", @xcite showed that radio emission comes from high temperature shock regions ; this suggests that relativistic electrons are accelerated in merger shocks .",
    "another important result from _ chandra _ is the discovery of complex x - ray structures in the central regions of cooling flow clusters with radio sources .",
    "recent _ chandra _ images and earlier results from _ rosat _ show that central radio sources in cooling flow clusters can inflate bubbles of nonthermal plasma which displace the x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "the x - ray images of the central regions of the hydra  a and perseus clusters revealed minima in the x - ray emission coincident with the radio lobes @xcite .",
    "subsequently , similar x - ray minima , corresponding to radio bubbles , were found in abell  2052 and mkw3s @xcite ; a particularly strong interaction between the icm and radio plasma was found in abell  2052 @xcite .",
    "for hydra  a , @xcite suggested that the agn activity may prevent the gas from cooling to low temperatures ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this suggests that these central regions are not simple , spherically - symmetric , hydrostatic systems .",
    "a wealth of previous x - ray observations has shown that gas in the cores of many clusters is cooling through at least part of the x - ray emitting temperature range from @xmath2@xmath4 to @xmath2@xmath5 k ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . since the cooling time of gas in many cluster cores is well below the age of the universe , cooling flows are the natural consequence of radiative cooling if there are no balancing heat sources .",
    "more recent spectral observations suggest that the gas does not continue to cool down to low temperatures at the rates suggested previously @xcite .",
    "observations had also suggested this ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "abell  133 is an x - ray luminous cluster at @xmath6 @xcite with a central cooling flow @xcite .",
    "the central cd galaxy is a radio source @xcite .",
    "there also is a diffuse , very steep spectrum radio source @xmath230 kpc north of the center of the cd galaxy , which has no optical counterpart and is classified as a radio relic @xcite .",
    "the radio relic source has an unusual filamentary structure .",
    "a comparison of previous _ rosat _ x - ray and _ vla _ radio observations revealed an excess of x - ray emission near to the cluster center which was spatially coincident with the radio relic @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the enhanced emission was the result of the interaction between a jet from the cd nucleus with hot icm .",
    "@xcite indicated that the excess x - ray emission in the @xmath7  kev band is too high to be attributed to the inverse compton ( ic ) emission from the high energy particles in the relic alone .",
    "on the basis of _ rosat _ data alone , one can not draw a conclusion about the interaction between the radio plasma and the hot icm because of _ rosat _ s limited spatial resolution and bandwidth . in this paper , we present _ chandra _ observations of the central region of abell  133 , which we use to study the x - ray morphology , temperature distribution , and the contribution of nonthermal emission . we assume @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 unless otherwise mentioned . at a redshift of 0.0562 , 1corresponds to 1.07 kpc .",
    "abell  133 was observed with _",
    "chandra _ on 2000 october 1314 for a useful exposure time of 35.5  ks .",
    "the observation was made with the center of the cluster located between node boundaries near the aim point on the back - illuminated chip s3 .",
    "the detector temperature during the observation was @xmath11 c. hot pixels , bad columns , and events with grades 1 , 5 , and 7 were excluded from the analysis .",
    "a few periods of time containing background flares were removed using the lc_clean software provided by maxim markevitch . ] .",
    "only data from the s3 chip are discussed here .",
    "figure  [ fig : csm]a shows the raw _ chandra _ image of the inner 2@xmath122  region of the cluster in the @xmath13  kev energy band , uncorrected for exposure or background .",
    "figure  [ fig : csm]b shows an adaptively smoothed image of the same region .",
    "chandra _ interactive analysis of observation ( ciao 2.0 ) routine csmooth was used .",
    "the image has a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of three per smoothing beam and was corrected for exposure , vignetting , and background .",
    "the background was taken from blank sky observations compiled by maxim markevitch .",
    "complex x - ray structures are seen within @xmath14 of the center of the cluster .",
    "the most prominent is a `` tongue''-like feature which extends from the cluster center to the northwest , and ends in two knots of emission .",
    "this tongue can be identified with the excess x - ray emission feature observed by _ rosat _",

    "12b in @xcite ) .",
    "to either side of the tongue , the x - ray surface brightness is rather low . at the southeast edge of the faint region to the east of the tongue",
    ", there is a diffuse arc of brighter x - ray emission which curves toward the northeast .",
    "the core region appears to have a relatively sharp , curved edge to the southeast .    within the core region ,",
    "there are several bright knots of x - ray emission , as well as the two knots at the end of the tongue .",
    "several of these knots appear to be small enough to be due to unresolved point sources .",
    "we used the wavelet source detection method to detect possible point sources in the image .",
    "the ciao wavdetectroutine was used with the significance threshold set at @xmath15 . within the central region of the cluster",
    ", three sources were detected with sizes consistent with point sources ; they are indicated in figure  [ fig : point ] .",
    "source c is the western knot at the tip of the tongue of x - ray emission .    in figure",
    "[ fig : radio ] , the 1.4 ghz radio image from @xcite is shown in green , superposed on the adaptively smoothed @xmath16 x - ray image ( figure  [ fig : csm]b ) in red .",
    "contours from the radio image are also shown in figure  [ fig : point ] .",
    "a fairly compact radio source is associated with the central cd galaxy .",
    "this appears in yellow in figure  [ fig : radio ] as this is also a peak in the x - ray image .",
    "this figure also shows the extended filamentary radio relic source to the nnw .",
    "the bright knots at the tip of the x - ray tongue are projected on the radio relic source , to the west of the brightest portion , and the yellow - orange color indicates that this region is bright in both radio and x - rays .",
    "however , most of the radio relic lies to the east and west of the tongue , projected on regions of relatively low x - ray surface brightness .",
    "an interesting aspect of the radio image are the long filaments extending to the east and south - east of the main portion of the relic .",
    "these filaments appear to wrap around the `` wing '' of brighter x - ray emission in this direction .",
    "also , there is some evidence that a shorter radio filament wraps around the northern edge of the tip of the x - ray tongue .    in figure",
    "[ fig : xopt ] , the x - ray contour plot of the central region of abell  133 is overlaid on the optical digital sky survey ( dss ) image . as can be seen",
    ", there is no optical counterpart of the x - ray tongue , neither for the entire tongue , nor for the point - like knots ( including source c ) at the end of the tongue .",
    "x - ray source  b corresponds to a galaxy ( 2masxi j0102379@xmath17215305 ) ; the optical position agrees with the x - ray position to within 1  and the galaxy is a member of abell  133 @xcite .",
    "this galaxy is also a compact radio source @xcite .",
    "the x - ray source  a is close to the optical center of the cd galaxy and the core of the central radio source in the cd galaxy , but is separated by about @xmath18 to the south .",
    "it is not clear whether source  a is really a distinct point source , perhaps due to the radio active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of the cd galaxy , or whether it is just the peak in the cluster surface brightness profile .",
    "the position of the cd galaxy , central radio source , and central x - ray peak are all shifted from the larger scale center ( see  [ sec : spatial_profiles ] ) of the x - ray emission toward the south .    to help visualize the faint x - ray structures around the cd galaxy , we compare the observed cluster to a smooth elliptical isophotal model .",
    "elliptical isophotes are fitted to the image using the iraf / stsdas task ellipse . before the fitting , we smoothed the image with a gaussian kernel with a width of 1 .",
    "since the x - ray structure around the cd is very complicated , the ellipticity , position angle , centroid , and intensity of the elliptical isophotes are all allowed to vary , except that the centroid of the innermost elliptical isophote is fixed to the position of the cd galaxy .",
    "the fits to the elliptical isophotes are used to create a smooth model of the image , which is subtracted from the original x - ray image of the cluster .",
    "the counts of the model image are multiplied by 0.5 before the subtraction to avoid oversubtraction .",
    "figure  [ fig : residu ] shows the subtracted image of the cluster .",
    "the cluster is nearly axisymmetric about the tongue ; faint wings extend from the center to the ne and sw .",
    "this `` bird - like '' structure and the shift of the cd galaxy toward the south or southwest may indicate that the cd galaxy and its environment are moving toward the south or southeast ( see   [ sec : disc_tongue_kh ] ) .",
    "note that if we do not multiply by 0.5 before the subtraction , the sw structure becomes unclear because the sw structure is a `` local '' excess , while on the average , the region to the north of the cd is brighter than the south in the innermost region around the cd .    unlike the other merging galaxy clusters abell  2142 @xcite , abell  3667 @xcite , rx  j1720.1 + 2638 @xcite , abell  2256 @xcite , ms  1455.0 + 2232 @xcite , and 1e0657@xmath1756 @xcite , abell  133 does not have clear surface brightness discontinuities except around the nw tongue and the complex structure within @xmath19 from the center ( figures  [ fig : csm ] and [ fig : xopt ] ) .      in order to study the x - ray structure quantitatively",
    ", we extracted surface brightness profiles for the @xmath13  kev band for three sectors shown in figure  [ fig : point ] .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : surf ] .",
    "they were derived by accumulating counts in circular annular wedges .",
    "the range of radii covered by each annulus is shown by the horizontal bars attached to each point .",
    "there are vertical error bars , but they are too small to be easily seen in the figure . because of the complexity of the structure in the central regions , it is difficult to select a center for the sectors .",
    "the center that we selected ( @xmath20 ; @xmath21 , j2000 ) is the centroid of the bright core of the x - ray emission , which we took to be outlined by the contour having a surface brightness of 4 counts / pixel ( 0.310 kev ) .",
    "as is obvious from figure  [ fig : point ] , the sector center does not coincide with the position of the cd galaxy ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23 , j2000 ) , nor does it lie on any of the brighter knots of x - ray emission within the core . however , it does lie along the extension of the x - ray tongue into the center of the core , which makes it easier to isolate the surface brightness profile of the tongue ( nw2 sector ) . with this center",
    ", the nw1 profile passes through much of the radio - emitting area outside of the region of the tongue .",
    "also , the drop in the surface brightness associated with the edge of the bright core region ( figures  [ fig : csm ] , [ fig : xopt ] , and  [ fig : residu ] ) can be studied with this center .",
    "the se profile shows that there is a small jump corresponding to a possible bow - shaped feature about 30  from the central cd ( figures  [ fig : csm ] , [ fig : xopt ] , [ fig : residu ] , and [ fig : surf ] ) . while the se profile is relatively smooth",
    ", the nw1 profile shows a depression at @xmath24 relative to a smooth interpolation of the declining surface brightness from smaller to larger radii .",
    "the position of this depression corresponds to that of the radio relic ( figure  [ fig : point ] ) .",
    "the nw1 sector also features a high surface brightness region associated with one of the x - ray knots near the center of the cd ( at 8) .",
    "the nw2 profile shows a hump or plateau at about the same radius of the depression , followed by a very rapid drop in surface brightness at about 40  ( figure  [ fig : surf ] ) .",
    "the hump represents the tip of the x - ray tongue .    for the se sector",
    ", we also determined the electron density profile by deprojecting the surface brightness profiles in figure  [ fig : surf ] assuming that the density distributions are spherically symmetric and the density is constant in spherical shells ( figure  [ fig : density ] ) . in the se sector , the density declines smoothly except for a small jump at a radius of about 30 , which corresponds to the small jump in figure  [ fig : surf ] .",
    "for the nw sectors , we show the density profiles outside the tongue and the relic because the assumption of spherical symmetry is not correct in the central regions .",
    "although we analyze the spectra in detail for a number of regions , a sense of the overall temperature distribution of the cluster can be found from an x - ray color image . for three energy bands ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27  kev ) , we make adaptively smoothed images as in figure  [ fig : csm]b .",
    "we allocate the colors of red , green , and blue to the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27  kev band images , respectively , and combine the three images .",
    "figure  [ fig : color ] shows the result ; the cluster center and the tongue are red , implying that these contain cooler gas . in particular",
    ", the tip of the tongue appears to be the coolest .",
    "there are no strong , sharp features which are blue ( hard spectra due to hot gas ) and which might be attributed to shocks .",
    "we extracted spectra in the @xmath28  kev band in pi channels from selected regions of the _ chandra _ image using the ciaosoftware package .",
    "we used the gain file acisd2000-01-29gainn0001.fits and the fef file acisd2000-01-29fef-pin0001.fits .",
    "both the response matrix files and the ancillary response files were calculated using the calcrmf / calcarf 1.07 package written by alexey vikhlinin and jonathan mcdowell .",
    "the package weighted the response files by the x - ray brightness over the corresponding image region .",
    "the spectra were grouped to have a minimum of 20 counts per bin , and fitted with one or two thermal models ( mekal , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) using xspec 11.00 .",
    "in general , we allowed the absorbing column to vary from the galactic value . in some regions , we fitted the spectra with a power - law model .",
    "errors on fitted spectral parameters are given at the 90% confidence level .",
    "first , we studied the average spectrum extracted from the innermost circular region of 25 radius .",
    "we found that this spectrum can not be reproduced by a single thermal component ( table  [ tab : tot ] ) , because this cluster has a temperature gradient (   [ sec : spectra_rad ] ) .",
    "the temperature at the cluster center is much lower than that in the outer region , so we fitted the spectrum with two thermal components with the same absorption .",
    "we assumed that the metallicities of the two thermal components were the same , because we could not constrain the metal abundance when they were fitted independently .",
    "we show the result in table  [ tab : tot ] . for comparison , we present the previous results on abell  133 from the _ einstein _ and _ exosat _ observatories @xcite . the higher of the two temperatures obtained with _",

    ", we derive the temperature of the x - ray tongue separately from that of the surrounding emission .",
    "the spectra were fitted by a mekal model with variable absorption . for most regions ,",
    "the single temperature model can reproduce the spectra ( @xmath34/dof @xmath35 ) , where dof is the degrees of freedom , except for the region of the tongue ( @xmath34/dof @xmath36 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : temp ] , the temperature increases gradually outward except for the nw sector . for the nw sector",
    ", the temperature shows a sudden rise with radius at @xmath37 for the profile excluding the tongue .",
    "a radius of @xmath37 corresponds to the southern edge of the deficit of x - ray emission associated with the radio relic ( figure  [ fig : surf ] ) .",
    "the fitted absorbing column density in the central regions is @xmath38 .",
    "the profile is not inconsistent with a uniform absorbing column .",
    "the temperature profiles in figure  [ fig : temp ] do not change significantly even if we fix the absorbing column density at the galactic value ( @xmath29 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we investigated more closely the x - ray spectra of the regions containing the radio relic and the tongue .",
    "the regions are shown in figure  [ fig : relic ] . in the radio relic ,",
    "our main purpose was to detect or limit the contribution of nonthermal inverse compton ( ic ) emission to the spectrum .",
    "we first fitted each region s spectrum using a single temperature model with a variable absorbing column density @xmath39 .",
    "this model is referred to as `` 1 t '' .",
    "the free parameters in this model are the temperature , @xmath40 , the metallicity of the gas , @xmath41 , measured relative to the solar photosphere values of @xcite , the absorbing column density , @xmath39 , and the normalization , @xmath42 . in the `` 1tpl '' model",
    ", we added a power - law component to the 1 t model .",
    "thus , the normalization and the power - law photon index ( @xmath43 ) were added to the free parameters . on the other hand",
    ", we fixed the metallicity in the 1tpl model at the value of the 1 t model , because it could not be constrained .",
    "given the radial temperature gradient ( figure  [ fig : temp ] ) , spectral complexity may also result from several different emission temperatures along the line of sight .",
    "thus , we also tried a two - temperature model `` 2 t '' with a variable absorption .",
    "we assume that metallicities of the two thermal components are the same .    for the radio relic region , the model with a power - law nonthermal component ( 1tpl )",
    "is slightly favored ( table  [ tab : region ] and figure  [ fig : sp]a ) .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath34 is not very significant . given the likely calibration uncertainties , we do not regard the detection of a power - law component as established .",
    "instead , we take the upper limit on the flux of this component as an upper limit on any power - law nonthermal spectral component",
    ". the upper limit on the @xmath13  kev flux of the power - law component is @xmath44 .",
    "we discuss the implications of this in  [ sec : disc_relic_b ] .",
    "the spectrum of the x - ray tongue is not fitted very well by a single temperature model , but is fitted adequately by either the 2 t or 1tpl model .",
    "the 2 t model is a somewhat better fit . in the 1tpl model",
    ", the fraction of the flux in the power - law component is relatively small ( 24% of the 0.310 kev flux ) , so most of the emission is thermal and relatively cool in any case .",
    "we note that the emission from the tongue can be explained by the superposition in projection of cold thermal emission from the small volume of the tongue , and the ambient hotter thermal emission in the cluster in front of and behind the tongue .",
    "this would account naturally for the need for two temperature components .",
    "to test this idea , we tried a model in which we fixed the absorbing column , the temperature , and the metallicity of the hotter gas spectral component to those derived from the spectrum of the region surrounding the tongue .",
    "we also fix the normalization of the hotter component to the expected value given the foreground and background volume of the tongue region .",
    "this model is listed as `` 2t@xmath45 '' in table  [ tab : region ] .",
    "the f - test indicates that this constrained model is as good a fit as the unconstrained two temperature model .",
    "we find that the intrinsic temperature of the cold gas in the tongue is 1.3  kev in the 2t@xmath45 model . in this model",
    ", the metallicity of the cooler component in the tongue is allowed to differ from that of the surrounding gas ; the best - fit value is slightly lower but agrees within the errors .",
    "nonthermal emission from the tongue is not required ( table  [ tab : region ] and figure  [ fig : sp]b ) . in this projection model , we assume that the tip of the tongue is a sphere with a radius of 8  kpc @xmath46 .",
    "the required electron density in the tongue is approximately @xmath47 , which implies that the tongue is nearly in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium at the same radius , whose pressure is @xmath48 kev @xmath49 @xmath50 dyn @xmath51 .    while there is a peak in the x - ray surface brightness at a position that nearly coincides with the center of the cd galaxy which is the host of a radio source , it is uncertain whether this is a peak in the density of the diffuse x - ray gas or x - ray emission from an agn .",
    "we determined the x - ray spectrum from a circular region with a radius of 5  centered on the x - ray brightness peak .",
    "the emission appears to be purely thermal , and does not show any evidence for a nonthermal , power - law component .",
    "the spectrum was consistent with an absorbing column that is identical to that for the surrounding region .",
    "these both suggest that the peak is emission from diffuse hot gas , and not primarily due to an agn .      in the central regions of the abell  133 cluster , the gas densities are high and the radiative cooling times are short .",
    "thus , we fitted the spectra of the inner regions using a cooling flow model .",
    "for ease of comparison with figure  [ fig : temp ] , the spectra were accumulated in a number of annuli , centered on the center of the sectors in figure  [ fig : point ] .",
    "the radii of the three annuli were selected to cover the central bright region except the tongue , the region containing the tongue , and the largest outside region fitting completely on the s3 chip . as a spectral model",
    ", we use the mkcflow model based on the mekal plasma emission code .",
    "we include any intrinsic absorption , @xmath52 , that may be acting on the cooling flow in the core of the cluster using the zwabs model .",
    "moreover , we add a mekal model representing the emission of the icm outside the cooling flow , subject to galactic absorption using the wabs model .",
    "we fix the galactic absorption at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the combination of the models is similar to that of @xcite : @xmath53 \\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the free parameters are given in parentheses .",
    "the intrinsic absorption @xmath54 acts only on the cooling flow emission .",
    "the normalization of the mkcflow model , @xmath55 , is the so - called cooling rate or mass deposition rate of the flow .",
    "we fix the metallicity @xmath41 and initial gas temperature @xmath56 in the mkcflow component to the values of metallicity and temperature of the mekal component , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : cool ] .",
    "the total mass deposition rate , @xmath57 , increases outward .",
    "we note that the mass deposition rate of the whole region ( @xmath58 ; @xmath59  kpc ) is somewhat larger than the deposition rate of @xmath60 ( corrected to @xmath61 ) from @xcite , although the errors overlap . for the entire region ,",
    "the luminosity of the cooling flow component is @xmath62 .",
    "we note that if we do not use the data below 0.9  kev , @xmath54 is significantly reduced ( parenthesis in table  [ tab : cool ] ) , and at the same time , @xmath55 also decreases .",
    "both @xmath54 and @xmath55 strongly depend on the data below 0.9  kev and they correlate with one another .",
    "this effect suggests that there may still be some calibration uncertainties for _ chandra _ below 0.9  kev .",
    "thus , we regard the evidence for excess absorption as preliminary .",
    "the most prominent feature of the _ chandra _ image of abell  133 is the tongue of colder x - ray emitting gas that extends from the center .",
    "cold filaments similar to the tongue are seen in a1795 and mkw3s with _",
    "@xcite and in virgo with _ xmm - newton _ ( @xcite ) and _ rosat _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss several possible explanations for the tongue .",
    "the four panels in figure  [ fig : ori ] illustrate these possibilities schematically .",
    "one possible origin of the tongue is a cooling wake ( figure  [ fig : ori]a ) .",
    "that is , the tongue might be gas which is cooling from the hot icm , attracted into a wake along the path of the moving cd galaxy @xcite . however , the temperature discontinuity between the tongue and the ambient hot gas is very sharp .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectra of @xmath63 wide regions along but just outside both sides of the tongue and find the temperature is @xmath64  kev , which is significantly higher than that of the tongue ( @xmath65  kev ) .",
    "this shows that the temperature of the gas changes on a scale of @xmath66  kpc . if the cooling wake scenario is correct , we expect a smooth temperature profile around the tongue .",
    "thus , our result does not seem to support the idea that the tongue is the cooling gas accreted from the ambient hot gas .",
    "recently , numerical simulations of cluster mergers by @xcite showed that ram pressure induced by a cluster merger can displace the core gas from the cluster s potential center . as a result ,",
    "the gas becomes convectively unstable , and in some cases , a convective plume of low entropy gas is formed . in the region of this plume , the variations in entropy of the gas are much greater than the variations in the pressure ; thus , the low entropy plume has a high density , a low temperature , and a very high x - ray emissivity .",
    "the plume and wings with low entropy gas shown at @xmath67 and 6.00  gyr in figure  14 of @xcite are remarkably similar to the x - ray distribution of abell  133 ( figures  [ fig : csm ] and  [ fig : residu ] ) .",
    "thus , based on the x - ray image alone , merger - induced convection would be a strong candidate to explain the origin of the x - ray tongue and overall x - ray morphology of the core of abell  133",
    ".    however , other observations are not fully consistent with this scenario , at least if the simulations in @xcite are typical . in this mechanism",
    ", the plume of dense gas must be falling towards the center of the cluster potential , and figure  14 in @xcite shows that the tip of the plume should be at the center of the cluster potential .",
    "since the stars in the cd galaxy will not be displaced by ram pressure , the optical center of the cd galaxy should be near to the center of the cluster potential .",
    "however , the _ chandra _ image shows that the cd galaxy is not at the tip of the x - ray tongue ( figure  [ fig : point ] ) .",

    "if the radio relic itself is moving to the nw with the velocity of @xmath138 ( mach number @xmath139 ) as a result of buoyancy (   [ sec : disc_tongue_bubble ] ) , the kh model may be more easily reconciled with the radio relic age .",
    "recent _ chandra _ x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and earlier _ rosat _ images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that radio sources at the centers of several clusters are inflating bubbles in the icm , which presumably consist of relativistic particles , magnetic fields , and possibly extremely hot thermal gas of low density .",
    "the radio bubbles have low x - ray surface brightnesses , presumably since the radio plasma has displaced the icm .",
    "these hot bubbles are buoyant and should be moving outward in the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "recent numerical simulations show that these hot bubbles may uplift cooler gas from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "the nonthermal plasma in the bubble can produce radio emission , while the uplifted dense , cool thermal gas will emit strongly in the x - ray band .",
    "the predicted configuration of a radio emitting bubble and uplifted x - ray gas is very similar to the one observed for abell  133 ( figure  [ fig : point ] ) and also in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "thus , the x - ray and radio observations may suggest that a bubble including the radio relic is uplifting the cold tongue from the cluster center .",
    "the deficit in x - ray surface brightness at the radio relic can also be explained by this picture ( figure  [ fig : surf ] ) .",
    "moreover , the fact that the tongue seems to be in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium is also favorable to this model @xcite .",
    "however , assuming the tongue results from the buoyant motion of the bubble , there should be another umbrella - like x - ray excess emission at the head of the bubble due to compression of cool gas ahead of the bubble , if the buoyant motion is in the plane of the sky ( see the upper right figure of figure  8 in * ? ? ?",

    ", if the buoyant motion were at an angle @xmath140 with respect to the plane of the sky and the bubble s depth along the line of sight is the same as its width ( @xmath141  kpc ) , the observed decrease in surface brightness ( @xmath142  % ; figure  [ fig : surf ] ) would be consistent with the idea that the bubble is deficient in x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "if we assume the age of the relic is @xmath143  yr @xcite , and the bubble including the relic was formed around the cd galaxy , the relative upward velocity must be @xmath144 .",
    "more realistically , if the velocity vector of the relic is at @xmath140 to the plane of the sky and the relic was formed by jet activity away from the cd galaxy , say at a distance of @xmath145  kpc from the cd , the upward velocity is still @xmath146 .",
    "the sound velocity of the surrounding gas ( @xmath147  kev ) is @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the mach number of the rising bubble is similar to the values of @xmath149 predicted by @xcite .    assuming that the density of the tip of the tongue is @xmath150 and the temperature is 1.3  kev (   [ sec : spectra_reg ] ) , the radiative cooling time is @xmath151  yr .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude longer than the estimated age of the radio relic .",
    "thus , if the tongue was uplifted by the buoyant motion of the radio relic , the low temperature of the tongue can not be the result of radiative cooling at its current position .",
    "the gas in the tongue presumably cooled radiatively when the gas was located closer to the center of the cd before it was uplifted .",
    "in addition , adiabatic cooling may have lowered the temperature further as the gas was lifted to regions with a lower ambient gas pressure .    given the high density of gas in the tongue and its large volume , one concern is whether the radio bubble could lift such a large mass and remain buoyant .",
    "for the purpose of this estimate , let us assume that the radio relic is filled with nonthermal and possibly thermal plasma having a very low density so that its x - ray emissivity is low .",
    "we further assume that the extent of the radio bubble along the line of sight is similar to its largest diameter in the plane of the sky ; we treat the radio bubble as an oblate spheroid .",
    "this is consistent with the flattened , `` mushroom cloud '' shape expected for a buoyant bubble @xcite .",
    "then , the total volume of the radio bubble is @xmath152 kpc@xmath153 . on the other hand ,",
    "we assume that the extent of the tongue along the line of sight is similar to its narrower dimension ; we treat it as a prolate spheroid , which is consistent with the uplifted trail below a convective bubble @xcite .",
    "then , the volume of the tongue is @xmath154 kpc@xmath153 . for an average tongue density of @xmath155 ,",
    "this implies a total mass of @xmath156 , thus , the average density of the material in the radio bubble and tongue combined is @xmath20.001 @xmath49 .",
    "this is still much lower than the typical gas densities at similar distances on either side of the cd galaxy in abell  133 ( figure  [ fig : density ] ) .",
    "thus , it is at least plausible that the radio bubble could have lifted the tongue via buoyancy .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the impact of the radio bubble on the cooling flow of abell  133 .",
    "if bubbles transport a large amount of cold gas from the cluster centers to the periphery of cooling flows , they may explain the lack of cooled gas in the cooling flows @xcite . as noted above",
    ", the total mass of the tongue is @xmath157 .",
    "this material has been lifted over the lifetime of the radio relic , which implies an average outflow rate of @xmath158 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the cooling inflow rate derived from the x - ray spectrum on the same radial scale ( table  [ tab : cool ] ) .",
    "however , the total cooling radius for abell  133 is much larger than the size of the x - ray tongue @xcite .",
    "thus , the tongue seems to reside well within the cooling radius of the cluster , and would therefore not actually transport gas outside of the cooling radius .",
    "moreover , as is shown in table  [ tab : cool ] , the mass deposition rate derived by spectral analysis is increasing outward at the position of the tongue .",
    "so , buoyant mass transport may affect the local mass cooling inflow rate near the center of abell  133 , but it probably does not affect the overall cooling rate .    the energy associated with the expansion and motion of the radio bubble might affect the energetics of the x - ray gas , and might partially counteract radiative cooling @xcite . assuming that the radio bubble is adiabatic , the work done by the radio bubble on the surrounding gas is @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the pressure and the volume of the radio bubble , respectively , and @xmath162 is the adiabatic constant .",
    "the subscripts 0 and 1 stand for the values when the radio bubble is formed and those at present , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the radio bubble was formed near the cluster center and has been nearly in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas , @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( figures  [ fig : density ] and  [ fig : temp ] ) . moreover , if we assume that the volume of the observed radio bubble is @xmath165 and @xmath166 , the initial volume is @xmath167 and the work is @xmath168 .",
    "moreover , the gravitational energy released by matter displacement is @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the density of the gas surrounding the tongue , and @xmath171 is the length of the tongue .",
    "the gravitational acceleration around the tongue is given by @xmath172 thus , the gravitational energy is @xmath173 , and the total energy released by the bubble motion is @xmath174 .",
    "if the work has been done during the past @xmath137  yr , the rate of work is @xmath175 . on the other hand ,",
    "the luminosity of the cooling flow component is @xmath176 ( see   [ sec : spectra_cool ] ) , which is smaller than @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the energy dissipated by the expansion of the radio bubble may compensate the energy radiated by cooling gas at least for this cluster at present , although it is uncertain what fraction of the dissipated energy is converted to thermal energy ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "although the buoyant radio bubble model may explain the observed tongue , at present it is not clear what conditions are required to produce uplifting of dense cool gas . for example , the numerical simulations of @xcite do not show the formation of a cold x - ray tongue .        assuming that the unusual radio source to the north of the cluster center in abell  133 is related to the cluster , there have been at least two suggestions as to its origin .",
    "first , the source might be a cluster radio relic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "radio relics are diffuse radio sources with steep spectra which are not associated with a radio galaxy in the cluster and which are generally located far from the center of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "generally speaking , radio relic sources tend to be moderately polarized .",
    "this and their outer location distinguish radio relics from radio halos .",
    "radio relics ( and radio halos ) are generally associated with clusters which appear to be undergoing a merger .",
    "a common theoretical interpretation is that radio relics are produced by acceleration , re - acceleration , or adiabatic compression of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields by merger shocks .",
    "some of the radio properties of the source in abell  133 seem at variance with those of other cluster radio relics .",
    "first , the radio source is projected only @xmath178 40 kpc from the cd galaxy of abell  133 .",
    "of course , it is possible that it is actually at a much larger radial distance , and only appears near the center in projection .",
    "there are several other radio relics seen in projection near cluster centers , including the sources in abell  13 and abell  4038 @xcite .",
    "second , the integrated polarization of the radio relic source in abell  133 is low ( @xmath2 2.3% * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unlike most radio relics .",
    "however , the low integrated polarization is mainly the result of variations in the direction of the polarization across the source .",
    "figure  [ fig : radio_polar ] shows the radio polarization at 1.465 ghz as a function of position in the radio relic source ; the data comes from the same observations discussed in @xcite .",
    "the data in figure  [ fig : radio_polar ] are not corrected for faraday rotation . in a number of comparatively large areas within the main body of the relic the polarized fraction varies between 3 and 20 percent , the larger fractions suggesting that either the faraday rotation in these areas is not large or that it is fairly uniform .",
    "note that even rotation measures as small as @xmath179 rad m@xmath180 would produce faraday rotations of @xmath181 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "in general , radio sources located near the centers of cluster cooling flows show very high faraday rotations ( @xmath182 rad m@xmath180 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that strong polarization is observed in the abell  133 relic without correction for faraday rotation may indicate the relic is located in front of , rather than within or behind , the cluster cool core .",
    "if the radio relic were produced by a merger shock and the magnetic field were strongly affected by compression in the shock , one would expect the magnetic field direction ( perpendicular to the electric vector ) to be mainly parallel to the shock front .",
    "indeed , we see in figure  [ fig : radio_polar ] that the electric vectors closest to the concave northern edge of the relic have the required orientation to suggest that this may be a shock front with a tangential magnetic field direction",
    ". of course , any other mechanism which produced a compression of the northern edge of the radio source might have the same effect ; if the radio source has risen buoyantly to the north , one might also expect some compression of this edge .",
    "however , this must be an uncertain interpretation until the electric vectors can be corrected for faraday rotation .",
    "several other features in figure  [ fig : radio_polar ] are of interest .",
    "the polarization near the bright knots at the tip of the x - ray tongue ( @xmath183 ; @xmath184 , b1950 ) and further down the tongue to the se is quite strong and particularly variable in direction .",
    "perhaps this indicates that the relic lies behind the tongue , and that the emission from those regions of the relic suffers strong and variable faraday rotation by the comparatively cool gas in the tongue .    in the two filaments of radio emission extending to the east and south - east , the polarizations are mainly perpendicular to the filaments , which implies that the magnetic field is parallel to them .",
    "the origin of these filaments may be connected to the magnetic field lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio relic in abell  133 is rather filamentary .",
    "although there are several possible origins for this structure , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the structure results from the compression of old radio plasma by merger shocks .    on the other hand , our _ chandra _ observations are largely inconsistent with a merger shock origin for the radio relic .",
    "first of all , no evidence for a shock is seen in the image ( figure  [ fig : point ] ) , x - ray colors ( figure  [ fig : color ] ) , or spectra ( figure  [ fig : sp ] ) of the radio relic region . if the radio relic coincided with a shock , this region should be unusually bright in x - rays , due mainly to compression of the cluster gas in the shock . actually , most of the radio relic region is unusually faint in x - rays ( figure  [ fig : surf ] ) .",
    "the exception is the region where the x - ray tongue overlaps the radio relic .",
    "however , the tongue is due to cool thermal gas , and is thus not a result of a merger shock .",
    "an alternative explanation of the radio relic is that it is an old radio lobe from the central radio source associated with the cd galaxy in abell  133 @xcite .",
    "an early radio map of the source suggested a bridge of emission connecting the cd radio source with the radio relic @xcite , but this does not appear in a more sensitive , higher resolution image @xcite .",
    "many of the radio properties of the relic are consistent with its interpretation as an old radio lobe .",
    "similar radio lobes associated with cd galaxies in cooling flow clusters generally have rather steep radio spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the displacement of the radio relic from the central cd might be due to buoyancy (   [ sec : disc_tongue_bubble ] ) , or to the motion of the central cd , perhaps as a result of a subcluster motion (   [ sec : disc_tongue_kh ] ) .",
    "one difficulty is that one usually finds two radio lobes , presumably produced by a double - sided jet .",
    "however , if the central cd is moving to the southeast , the two bubbles would be displaced in the same direction and might either overlap in projection or have merged together .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations are probably more consistent with the interpretation of this radio source as a relic radio lobe formerly energized by the central cd , rather than a merger - shock generated cluster radio relic .",
    "radio lobes associated with cd galaxies at the centers of cooling flow clusters produce holes in the x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the radio plasma has displaced the thermal , x - ray emitting gas . in abell  133 ,",
    "the radio relic region is also somewhat fainter in x - rays than the surrounding region ( figure  [ fig : surf ] ) . as noted in   [ sec : disc_tongue_bubble ] , many properties of the x - ray tongue are consistent with gas which has been uplifted by a buoyant radio bubble .",
    "in fact , the overall radio and x - ray properties of the relic source in abell  133 are similar to the eastern radio bubble ( the `` ear '' ) of m87 in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "this mushroom - shaped radio bubble has a shape similar to the radio source in abell  133 , and also has a very steep radio spectrum .",
    "the m87 ear is filamentary , although mainly around its edge . in m87",
    ", there is a linear extension of x - ray emission due to cool , thermal gas which connects the center of the cluster with the radio bubble @xcite , similar to the tongue in abell  133 .",
    "the radio and x - ray structure of m87 have been interpreted as the result of a buoyant radio bubble @xcite .",
    "one difference between m87 and abell  133 is that there is radio emission connecting the ear in m87 with the nucleus of the galaxy , while the radio relic in abell  133 does not show any strong radio bridge with the central cd .",
    "this might be a result of a lower level of current agn activity in the cd galaxy in abell  133 compared to m87 .    in summary ,",
    "our x - ray observations are more consistent with the interpretation of the radio relic in abell  133 as a displaced radio lobe from the central cd , rather than as a merger shock - induced relic .",
    "in   [ sec : spectra_reg ] , we found an ( at best ) marginal detection of nonthermal x - ray emission from a radio relic .",
    "we now use these spectral results to constrain the magnetic field in the radio relic , under the assumption that this nonthermal emission is due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering . in the model with a power - law component ( model  1tpl in   [ sec : spectra_reg ] ) , the x - ray flux of the power - law component is @xmath185 for @xmath186  kev and the photon index is @xmath187 .",
    "the radio synchrotron flux density of the relic is 137  mjy and flux density spectral index is @xmath188 ( flux density proportional to @xmath189 ) , both at @xmath190  ghz @xcite . for emission from a single power - law electron energy distribution ,",
    "the ic and synchrotron emission have the same spectral index .",
    "this would require @xmath191 , which is not consistent with our measured values . however , the ic x - ray emission in the _ chandra _ band would be due to relatively low energy relativistic electrons , which would produce very low frequency radio emission . both observations and models suggest that the radio spectrum is considerably flatter at lower frequencies @xcite , and thus the x - ray and radio spectral indices might be consistent",
    ". we will adopt the x - ray spectral index and compare the x - ray flux with the radio flux density of @xmath192 jy at 80 mhz , the lowest frequency at which the flux density is determined accurately .",
    "this radio flux density includes the cd galaxy and another nearby radio source , but they are much weaker than the radio relic . using the standard expressions for the ic and synchrotron emission assuming a power - law electron energy distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that the required magnetic field in the relic is @xmath193 .",
    "this is about one order of magnitude smaller than the magnetic field @xcite derived from models for the radio spectral index ( @xmath194 ) or minimum energy arguments applied to the radio flux ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "this might indicate that the magnetic field is filamentary and highly variable , which may also be suggested by the radio image of the the relic .",
    "however , given the marginal detection of the nonthermal x - ray emission and the disparity between the magnetic field values required by the radio and x - ray observations , we believe it is best to treat the x - ray spectral result as an upper limit of the nonthermal flux .",
    "this implies a lower limit on the radio relic magnetic field of @xmath196 , which is consistent with the radio results but not constraining .",
    "we have presented the results of a _",
    "chandra _ observation of the cluster of galaxies abell  133 .",
    "the x - ray image shows a tongue of emission extending from the cd galaxy to the nw ; the tongue extends in the direction of and partially overlaps the radio relic .",
    "there is no optical counterpart of the tongue .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness at the position of the radio relic is smaller than the surrounding region except for the tongue , suggesting that the radio plasma has displaced the thermal gas in this region .",
    "the x - ray spectrum indicates that the emission from the tongue is thermal , and the temperature is distinctly lower than that of the ambient hot gas .",
    "we discussed several possible origins for the tongue ; two of these seem reasonably consistent with the x - ray and radio data .",
    "first , the tongue may be the result of a kelvin - helmholtz instability acting on the cool core surrounding the cd galaxy as the cd moves through surrounding , lower density gas .",
    "we show that the cd galaxy and the cold gas around it must be moving with a velocity of @xmath197 km s@xmath3 for a large scale kh instability to develop between the cold core and the ambient hot intracluster medium .",
    "the critical velocity for the kh instability is several times smaller for abell  133 than for other clusters which show smooth , well - defined cold fronts .",
    "the required motion of the cd galaxy is consistent with its offset position in the cluster relative to the x - ray centroid determined at large radii .",
    "this offset can be explained if the velocity of the cd galaxy is @xmath198 .",
    "thus the onset of a kh instability is at least plausible .",
    "the second possibility is that the radio relic is a buoyant radio bubble , and that the tongue was uplifted by the motion of this bubble .",
    "recent numerical simulations indicate that buoyant bubbles of nonthermal plasma produced by agn activity can uplift cold gas from the cluster center @xcite . for abell  133",
    ", we suggest that the bubble is the radio relic , and that it uplifts the x - ray tongue .",
    "the velocity of the radio bubble expected from the age of the radio relic is consistent with that predicted numerically .",
    "the energy dissipated by the moving bubble may affect the cooling flow in abell  133 .",
    "the origin of the filamentary radio relic source in abell  133 remains uncertain .",
    "it may be a radio source that is generated by a shock wave from merging clusters , similar to the relics which are often seen in the outer regions of clusters .",
    "in this case , the radio emitting electrons would have been accelerated , re - accelerated , and/or compressed by the cluster merger shock .",
    "alternatively , the radio relic might be a displaced radio lobe ( or lobes ) from the radio source associated with the central cd galaxy in the cluster .",
    "the lack of evidence for a merger shock near the relic , the anti - correlation between the radio and x - ray emission across most of the relic , and the association of the relic with the tongue of cool , dense x - ray gas all are more consistent with the relic being a displaced radio lobe or bubble , rather than being a cluster merger - shock induced radio relic .",
