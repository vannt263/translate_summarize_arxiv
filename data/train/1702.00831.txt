    "1901 diederik johannes korteweg proposed the dynamics equations for fluids with capillarity , based on van der waals approach . *",
    "1917 david enskog defended his thesis in which he gave a systematic derivation of the navier - stokes - fourier equations from the boltzmann equation and predicted the thermodiffusion effect in the mixtures of gases .",
    "the latter was used in early uranium separation technologies . *",
    "1932 steven chapman and steven cowling refined the method of enskog and wrote the classical treatise ` mathematical theory of non - uniform gases ' .",
    "thus , at the beginning of the 20th century , the main equations we intend to discuss were invented .",
    "the navier  stokes  fourier equations and the boltzmann equation were known and hilbert considered reduction from kinetics ( ` the atomistic view ' ) to fluid mechanics as a crucially important problem .",
    "van der waals proposed to include in the energy density a new term , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the density and @xmath2 is the capillarity coefficient @xcite .",
    "his doctorate student , korteweg , found how this term affects the motion of fluids , and created the dynamics of fluids with capillarity @xcite .",
    "since then the research tree has branched enormously .",
    "the van der waals capillarity term played an essential role in a number of important achievements : in the landau theory of phase transitions @xcite and the ginzburg  landau theory of superfluids and superconductors @xcite , in cahn  hilliard models of phase separation @xcite and in the langer bar - on and miller theory of spinodal decomposition @xcite , to name a few .",
    "many new equations of motion were invented and studied for various continuous media , and a special discipline , _ rational thermodynamics _",
    ", was developed to manage this world of continuum mechanics models @xcite .",
    "in particular , the korteweg equations were slightly revised by means of rational thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the fluid dynamics equations were rigorously derived from boltzmann s kinetics in some _ rescaling limits _ : if we consider a flow of an almost equilibrium gas with very small space derivatives of velocities and density and then change the time scale ( go to ` slow time ' ) then the euler equations hold for this flow with high accuracy . for some scaling procedures ,",
    "the navier  stokes  fourier equations can be achieved as well .",
    "( exact statements , more details , more results and further references can be found in the book @xcite . )",
    "several families of methods were developed in theoretical physics for deduction of fluid dynamic equations from kinetic equations . we introduce some of them later .",
    "they usually work well for the derivation of the ` expected ' euler and navier  stokes  fourier equations but the next step , a correction to the navier ",
    "stokes equations for more non - equilibrium regimes , was far less successful .",
    "therefore , the most challenging goal of these methods , the correct new post  navier  stokes  fourier equations , remained unachieved .      in 1946 john von neumann stated that computational fluid dynamics would make experimental fluid dynamics obsolete @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the computational approach to the problem as discussed by von neumann has been developing in many relevant works published meanwhile including e.g. very recent publications @xcite or @xcite .",
    "but rephrasing the famous quotation of lord kelvin @xcite we can say that the beauty and clearness of the theory , which explains fluid dynamics equations as special limits of kinetic equations , is at present obscured by a cloud .",
    "higher - order corrections to the navier  stokes  fourier equations produced from kinetics beyond the degenerated scaled flows demonstrate some non - physical properties and can not be used without regularization",
    ". moreover , there are relatively simple experiments with rarefied gases ( known to reynolds and maxwell in 1879 @xcite ) which can be captured by neither the navier  stokes  fourier equations nor by the higher - order corrections obtained from the boltzmann equations by regular procedures . these are , for example , effects of thermal creep ( or transpiration ) , i.e. the steady motion of a rarefied gas induced by a temperature gradient on the boundary of the flow domain , which are demonstrated by the crookes radiometer ( the light mill , fig .",
    "[ lightmill ] ) .",
    "another example of such a system is the knudsen pump @xcite . in knudsen",
    "s experiments , it was a pipe with alternating narrow ( diameter 1/3 mm ) and wide ( diameter 10 mm ) segments of 5 cm length ( fig .",
    "[ knudsenpump ] ) .",
    "every second pipe joint was heated by a special heating element .",
    "metallic wire was used for heat removal from other joints .",
    "the temperature difference between the heated and unheated pipe joints was c. for normal pressure , there was no difference in pressure at the opposite ends of the pipe , whereas for the pressure at one end , @xmath3 mmhg ( 65 pa ) the ratio between these pressures is @xmath4 .",
    "recently , this system was revisited , both by the reproduction of experiments and by theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "the effect was also demonstrated on two joined pipes of different inner diameters , 12 and 24 mm , each 60 mm in length .",
    "the joint was heated to about c , the ends were cooled by thick copper plates .",
    "the flux from the thinner to the thicker pipe was indicated for the pressure 5 - 50 pa . at pressure 100 pa ( and above )",
    "there was no motion observed in this system @xcite .",
    "of course , these effects do not contradict the kinetic theory and can be explained in the framework of boltzmann s kinetics and some of its simplifications @xcite .",
    "the problem is in the appropriate continuum mechanics model , which is produced systematically from kinetics and explains thermal creeps .",
    "the prophecy of von neumann is unfulfilled not only because the computational tools are insufficient but also because the proper equations for some situations remain unknown .",
    "van der waals introduced capillarity energy for non - ideal multiphase fluids @xcite . however , the terms which look similar to korteweg s stress tensor have been recognized in the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion for non - equilibrium ideal gas many times . everyone can compare the korteweg stress ( equation ( [ kstress ] ) below ) with burnett s equations , the first post - navier - stokes correction derived from the boltzmann equation ( see , for example , the chapman and cowling book @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it was not before the exact summation of the entire chapman ",
    "enskog series was found @xcite that the following rule was discovered @xcite : _ chapman ",
    "enskog @xmath5 viscosity + capillarity .",
    "_    the problem with burnett s equations is , among others , in the wrong _ sign _ of the higher - order correction terms leading to a parasite instability of short waves ( bobylev s instability @xcite ) .",
    "maxwell , in his attempt to describe thermal creep , encountered the wrong sign of the effect ( according to burnett s equations the light mill rotates in the direction opposite to the experimentally observed rotation ) .",
    "the exact solutions demonstrate that the van der waals capillarity emerges in the non - equilibrium _ ideal _ gas .",
    "therefore , korteweg s equations can be a candidate for the post ",
    "navier  stokes  fourier equations .",
    "the fact that the van der waals capillarity energy emerges from a rigorous analytic solution of the reduction problem for kinetic models of ideal gas was unexpected .    on the other hand ,",
    "the exact solutions demonstrate saturation of dissipation : the attenuation rate of the acoustic waves has a finite limit when the wave length tends to zero @xcite . in that respect",
    ", the original korteweg s equation may be not sufficient : for them , the attenuation rate grows as ( frequency)@xmath6 ( for high frequency , see ( [ ehrenroots ] ) and fig .",
    "[ spectrakortewehren]b below ) .",
    "two different hypotheses seem to be possible at present :    * for the genuine boltzmann equation with realistic interaction between the particles , the asymptotic of the attenuation rate of acoustic waves is the same as for the korteweg equations ; * the proper hydrodynamics for non - equilibrium gas should include the mixed derivatives , which look like the operator @xmath7 in the left hand side of the equations ( in the simplest form ) , where @xmath8 is the laplace operator .",
    "there are some arguments in favor of the korteweg asymptotic reported very recently @xcite . nevertheless , the second hypothesis is strongly supported by the exactly solved problem , as we demonstrate below .      in high school textbooks and popular science literature ,",
    "capillarity is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow gaps without the assistance of , and in opposition to , external forces such as external pressure or gravity . in scientific literature ,",
    "capillarity is used in wider sense .",
    "for example , the pressure difference across the curve interface is termed the ",
    "capillary pressure. gibbs theory of capillarity @xcite carries the title `` influence of surfaces of discontinuity upon the equilibrium of heterogeneous masses . ''",
    "this title includes two important ideas : _ equilibrium _ and _ discontinuity_. on the contrary , van der waals @xcite proposed the theory of _ continuous _ transition layers which was developed later in the _ dynamic _ phase field theory and numerics . in the limit of the thin equilibrium film",
    ", the van der waals theory gives results very similar to the gibbs theory .",
    "gibbs studied energy and equilibria of interface surfaces .",
    "we can call them infinitely  thin films , films without thickness .",
    "van der waals and , later , his student korteweg studied continuous media with energy dependent on density gradients .",
    "we can call the van der waals transition layers  thick films , they have non - negligible thickness and volume .",
    "now , we aim to demonstrate that even very simplified piecewise continuous approximation of a thick film can give useful insights .",
    "consider two chambers with fluid connected by a capillary tube ( fig .",
    "[ chambers ] ) .",
    "assume that a system of heaters and coolers keeps the temperatures , @xmath9 , in these chambers constant in time .",
    "in a steady state , there is no fluid flux through the tube but a heat flux exists and so this is not a thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "two limit cases for gases are very well known :    * _ the navier  stokes limit _ , the mean free path @xmath10 . in this limit zero flux implies zero pressure difference . in the steady state @xmath11 ; * _ the knudsen limit _ @xmath12 , the flux in the capillary tube is collisionless .",
    "the gas flux from the hot chamber to the cold chamber is @xmath13 and the inverse flux is @xmath14 with the same @xmath15 ( we presume that the capillary tube is symmetric ) . here , @xmath16 is density , the ideal gas equation gives @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the thermal velocity , proportional to @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the zero flux condition gives @xmath21    in the knudsen limit , we see how the steady state difference between temperatures produces the difference between pressures .",
    "this is called the _ thermomechanical effect _ , and the effect of the capillary flux induced by the temperature gradient is called _",
    "thermoosmosis_. the ratio @xmath22 is called the _ thermal transpiration ratio_.    the thermomechanical effect and thermoosmosis were discovered in the 20th century for various fluids , from rarefied gases to superfluid liquids and water @xcite .",
    "now , they are considered as a promising driving mechanism for micro- or nanoscale engines @xcite .",
    "there are many approaches to the theory of these effects based on non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "all of them include unknown parameters , which should be found experimentally . here",
    "we will demonstrate two simple models based on capillarity ( perhaps , the simplest models ) .",
    "first of all , assume that the thermomechanical effect is produced by a thin layer at the wall of the capillary .",
    "the property of this surface depends on the thermodynamic conditions and on the material of the wall and the fluid .    in the gibbs approach",
    "@xcite we operate with a thin film ( a surface ) .",
    "the force in the thermomechanical effect should be proportional to the length of the section of this surface , that is the circle , @xmath23 , and the pressure difference should be ( fig .",
    "[ thermomechanic ] ) @xmath24    this model includes one unknown coefficient @xmath25 , which can be easily evaluated from the empiric curves ( fig .",
    "[ thermomechanic ] ) . of course",
    ", this simplest model belongs to type 5 of peierls classification @xcite : ` instructive model ( no quantitative justifications but gives insight ) ' or even to type 6 : ` analogy ( only some features in common ) ' .",
    "this model works well in comparison with experiment ( fig .",
    "[ thermomechanic ] ) for not very high knudsen numbers @xmath26 , gives the proper navier ",
    "stokes limit , but has one fundamental defect : @xmath27 when @xmath28 ( or , which is the same , kn@xmath29 ) .    to improve the model , let us follow the van der waals capillarity idea .",
    "consider a ` thick film ' near the border with thickness @xmath30 , if @xmath31 . if @xmath32 then the thick surface fills the whole capillary .",
    "assume that the thickness is proportional to the mean free path , @xmath33 .",
    "the force of the thermomechanical effect in this model is proportional to the section of the surface orthogonal to the axis of the capillary ( to the surface area ) , and to the particle density ( empty space does not produce force ) : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the area of the section .",
    "the coefficient @xmath36 has the physical sense of ` energy per particle ' and describes the energetic difference between the boundary layer of thickness @xmath30 and the rest of the volume of the capillary tube .",
    "recall that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the collision diameter of molecules , and @xmath39 .",
    "evaluate @xmath40 at the cold end .",
    "after simple algebra we get the formula for the transpiration ratio in the thick film approximation : @xmath41 here , @xmath36 is still an unknown coefficient .",
    "the thick film fills the whole capillary at kn=1/(2a ) .",
    "it is convenient to gather all the coefficients into two unknown numbers : coefficient @xmath42 ( a function of temperature , which can be easily extracted from the knudsen asymptotic ) and the ratio of the film thickness to the mean free path , @xmath43 .",
    "we express the thermal transpiration ratio through the knudsen number : @xmath44    the thick surface model has the proper high kn and low kn asymptotics and can be used for the understanding the data .",
    "of course , it is not far from the simple dimensional analysis and belongs to type 5 or 6 of peierls classification .",
    "it does not reveal the intrinsic physical mechanism of the thermomechanic effect and the thermoosmosis .",
    "we just hypothesized that these effects are connected to the energy ( enthalpy ) density in the layers near the interface between gas and capillary and to the transport in these layers ( thermoosmosis slip ) .",
    "the models can be improved if we account carefully for variations of the films along the tube .",
    "solving the korteweg equations instead of postulating of the thick surface can provide the further improvements , but this next step requires more technical effort .",
    "some calculations of boundary layers and transpiration were performed recently on the basis of korteweg s equation @xcite .",
    "the problem is not in an accurate calculation of these effects .",
    "the kinetic equations or even direct molecular simulation do this job quite well .",
    "the question is about an appropriate continuum model that describes the bulk motion , the thermal transpiration and the other similar effects in a unified way .    in any case ,",
    "already very simple models demonstrate that the transport phenomena of the rarefied gas near the interfaces may be described using the idea of capillarity .",
    "we might imagine that the light mill is a close relative of the soap boat @xcite because both are moving by capillarity effects .",
    "the goal of this paper is to highlight the origin of the capillarity of ideal gas . for this purpose",
    ", we give a comprehensive introduction into modern theory of dynamic model reduction from kinetics to fluid dynamics and analyze approximate and recently found exact solutions of this problem .    in the next section ,",
    "we start the unhurried introduction of the main equations : from the conservation of mass and cauchy equations to the navier  stokes  fourier equations . in section",
    "[ sec : kortewegstress ] , korteweg s stress tensor is described .",
    "after that , we discuss a simple ` mean free path ' theory for korteweg s stress . to that end , the idea of ehrenfests coarse - graining is utilized : we take the collisionless knudsen gas with periodic equilibration to the local equilibrium and analyze the post - navier  stokes equation derived by this approach .",
    "after that , a short but comprehensive explanation of the chapman ",
    "enskog procedure is presented .",
    "we introduce the invariance equation in section  [ sec : invariance ] and construct the chapman  enskog as a formal solution to this equation ( section  [ sec : ch - e ] ) .",
    "the geometric language allows us to avoid the usual bulky calculations while describing the main constructions .",
    "analysis of exactly solvable problem of reduction allows us to prove that the capillarity effects in ideal gas is not a by - product of special approximations and series expansions but appears as a direct consequence of kinetic equations . in section  [ sec : capidgas ] the energy formula for hydrodynamics of non - equilibrium ideal gas is proved .",
    "it includes the pseudodifferential capillarity term , which coincides with the van der waals energy of capillarity in first approximation .",
    "finally , hypotheses are discussed about the plausible forms of non - equilibrium fluid mechanics .",
    "consider the classical fluid , which is defined by the _",
    "hydrodynamic fields _ : density @xmath1 ( scalar ) , velocity @xmath45 ( vector ) , and specific internal energy @xmath46 , that is internal energy per unit of mass ( scalar ) .",
    "@xmath47      @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the body force density , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) are normal stresses , and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) are shear stresses .",
    "the pressure @xmath54 is @xmath55    the cauchy stress tensor @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) describes the so - called _ contact force _ : let for a small element of a body surface with area @xmath58 and outer normal vector @xmath59 the stress tensor @xmath60 be given .",
    "then the force applied _ to the body _ through this surface fragment",
    "is @xmath61 the stress tensor is symmetric ( to provide conservation of angular momentum ) , @xmath62 .",
    "the momentum equation ( [ conservationmomentum ] ) is the second newton law written for a small brick of the material : imagine a small cubic brick ( a ` parcel ' ) with soft but impenetrable boundaries and edges parallel to the coordinate axes , which moves with the material . the outer normals of the opposite faces differ by sign only , therefore the sum of the contact forces from all faces is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the edge of the brick ( use the taylor formula for @xmath52 ) .",
    "the possibility to represent the motion of continuum as the flight of many infinitesimal parcels with soft deformable but impenetrable boundaries is in the essence of the mechanics of materials .",
    "if the material body @xmath65 experiences infinitisemal _ displacement _ @xmath66 , which vanishes with derivatives on the boundary , then the work of the contact forces is ( use the stokes formula for integration by parts ) : @xmath67 take into account symmetry of @xmath52 and find that @xmath68 depends on the symmetric part of @xmath69 : @xmath70 the power is the work per time . for a moving of continuum media ,",
    "the power produced by the contact forces is @xmath71    according to the cauchy equation and the formula for power we can write the conservation of energy @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the energy density per unit mass : @xmath74 , @xmath46 is the _ specific internal energy _ ,",

    "cauchy equations are simple and nice , and can be applied to many materials ( and even beyond the mechanics of materials ) .",
    "the question is : how can we express the stress tensor and the heat flux through the hydrodynamic fields : density @xmath1 , velocity @xmath45 , and specific internal energy @xmath46 ?",
    "the simplest answer is given by the navier  stokes stress tensor and fourier heat flux : @xmath81 here ( and in what follows ) , @xmath82 is kronecker s delta , @xmath83 , @xmath84 are elastic and viscous contributions to the cauchy stress tensor , the coefficients @xmath40 , @xmath85 and @xmath36 depend on density and temperature .",
    "the thermodynamic pressure @xmath54 in the elastic stress is defined through the equation of state .",
    "for example , for ideal gas @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the molar density ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the standard assumption is that the viscous tensor has zero trace and , therefore , @xmath89 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is just an assumption and the mechanical pressure should not necessarily coincide with the thermodynamic pressure and may have a viscous component .    with the _ constitutive equations _ ( [ nsfstress ] )",

    "the korteweg equation is the first post navier  stokes  fourier equation , which remains inside continuum mechanics but captures some nonequilibrium kinetic phenomena like the capillarity of ideal gas .",
    "exact solutions of the reduction problem ( from kinetics to hydrodynamics ) give us hints of how the post navier ",
    "stokes equations may look .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the dissipation and the capillarity terms in the energy equation resulting from the exact summation are of same order if the gradients are not small .",
    "thus , korteweg s term is not just a small correction to dissipation but rather a contribution to the energy balance on the same scale .",
    "korteweg s equations were originally introduced in relation to non - ideal gas equation of state to capture the effect of surface tension between different phases .",
    "so , after all , _",
    "why _ capillarity emerges in ideal gas ?",
    "the answer to this question is in the nature of the interface of the _ brick of matter _ in cauchy stress construction .",
    "whenever the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields become commensurable with the mean free path , there is an energy price to be paid for their maintenance .",
    "the highly idealized conventional picture of continuous media assumes an almost impenetrable elastic interface ( euler ) with only a small smearing ( navier  stokes  fourier ) of the order of a mean free path . however , when the gradients increase , also the dispersion effects come into play which is precisely what the surface energy is responsible for in korteweg s picture .",
    "it is clear that the non - locality associated with this effect is essential since no truncation of the chapman ",
    "enskog series is possible .",
    "we demonstrated how the van der waals capillarity appears in dynamics of ideal gas .",
    "the above assertion is based on the linearized model equations , the only case so far which was amenable to the exact solution .",
