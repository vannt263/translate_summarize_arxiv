    "ultracold molecules offer new opportunities for scientific exploration , including studies of molecular bose - einstein condensates , novel quantum phases , and ultracold chemistry . for molecular interactions that take place at microkelvin temperatures , even the smallest activation energy exceeds the available thermal energy .",
    "this opens up new possibilities for controlling the pathways of chemical reactions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a major objective of current experiments on cold molecules is to achieve quantum degeneracy , particularly for polar molecules .",
    "two approaches are being pursued : indirect methods , in which molecules are formed from pre - cooled atomic gases , and direct methods , in which molecules are cooled from room temperature .",
    "there have been very substantial recent advances , particularly in indirect methods . in particular , the jila @xcite and innsbruck @xcite groups have formed deeply bound ground - state molecules at temperatures below 1 @xmath5k , by magnetoassociation of pairs of ultracold atoms followed by coherent state transfer with lasers .",
    "methods that form ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms are however restricted at present to species formed from heavy alkali - metal atoms .",
    "direct methods , such as buffer - gas cooling @xcite , stark deceleration @xcite , crossed - beam collisional cooling @xcite and maxwell extraction @xcite , are applicable to a much larger variety of chemically interesting molecules .",
    "however , these methods can not yet reach temperatures below 10 to 100  mk . finding a way to cool these molecules further , below 1  mk , is one of the biggest challenges facing the field .",
    "the most promising possibility is so - called sympathetic cooling , in which cold molecules are introduced into an ultracold atomic gas and thermalize with it .",
    "sympathetic cooling has been successfully used to achieve fermi degeneracy in @xmath6li @xcite and bose - einstein condensation in @xmath7k @xcite , and for producing ultracold ions @xcite .",
    "however , it has not yet been achieved for molecular systems , although there are theoretical proposals for experiments in which ultracold nh or nd@xmath8 molecules are obtained by collisions with a bath of colder atoms such as rb , mg or n @xcite .",
    "the group at imperial college london recently succeeded in producing samples of cold lih molecules in the first rotationally excited state @xcite using stark deceleration .",
    "lih is an attractive molecule for cooling , since it has large dipole moment and light mass , so that it can be controlled easily with fields .",
    "it has a relatively large rotational constant ( 7.5 @xmath0 ) , which opens up the possibility of producing cold molecules in a single excited rotational state .",
    "there is proposal to produce ultracold lih molecules by sympathetic cooling with li @xcite .",
    "however , sympathetic cooling can be successful only if the rate of elastic ( thermalization ) collisions is large compared to the rate of inelastic ( deexcitation ) collisions , which cause trap loss .",
    "the main objects of the present paper are to explore the interaction between li atoms and lih molecules , to understand the nature of the interaction between these two species , and to obtain a detailed and accurate potential energy surface for the li  lih system .",
    "the results of scattering calculations at ultralow temperature are very sensitive to the details of the interaction potential @xcite . for systems containing heavy atoms",
    ", the methods of quantum chemistry currently available can not generate interaction potentials with accuracy better than a few percent .",
    "this limitation is caused by approximate treatments of correlation effects and relativistic contributions . with potential energy surfaces of moderate precision",
    ", it is usually possible to extract only qualitative information from low - energy collision calculations .",
    "by contrast , li  lih is a light system containing only 7 electrons and state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations can be performed with no significant approximations .",
    "it therefore offers a unique possibility to produce a very precise interaction potential , which will allow a quantitative description of li  lih collision dynamics , even in the ultralow temperature regime .    in electronic structure calculations",
    "one aims at approaching the exact solution of the schrdinger equation , as closely as possible within the algebraic approximation . in practice , this is accomplished by combining hierarchies of one - electron and @xmath9-electron expansions .",
    "the accuracy increases across the hierarchies in a systematic manner , allowing the errors in the calculations to be controlled and a systematic approach to the the exact solution to be achieved .",
    "the standard @xmath9-electron hierarchy employed in electronic structure calculations consists of the hartree - fock ( hf ) , second - order mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) , coupled - cluster with single and double excitations ( ccsd ) , and coupled - cluster with single , double , and approximate noniterative triple excitations [ ccsd(t ) ] models , with the latter recovering most of the correlation energy .",
    "thus , ccsd(t ) constitutes a robust and accurate computational tool nowadays .",
    "all these models are size - consistent , which means that the interaction potential shows the correct dissociation behaviour at large intermolecular distances .",
    "in contrast , methods based on the configuration interaction approach with a restricted excitation space like multireference configuration interaction limited to single and double excitations ( mrcisd ) are not size - consistent and therefore they are not well suited for calculations of the interaction energy .",
    "the most popular example of a one - electron hierarchy is the family of dunning correlation - consistent polarized valence basis sets , cc - pv@xmath1z @xcite with the cardinal number @xmath1 going from d ( double - zeta ) , through t indicating triple - zeta , and so on .",
    "these have successfully been combined with the hf , mp2 , ccsd , ccsd(t ) hierarchy of wave function models for the calculation of various molecular properties @xcite .",
    "the basis - set limit , corresponding to @xmath10 , may be approached either by extrapolating the results obtained with finite cardinal numbers towards infinite @xmath1 @xcite , or by replacing the standard one - electron hierarchy by explicitly - correlated methods , such as ccsd ",
    "f12 and ccsd(t)f12 @xcite , in which the interelectron distance @xmath11 is explicitly introduced into the wave function@xcite .",
    "the f12 methods have recently been implemented efficiently @xcite and shown to accelerate the convergence towards the basis - set limit for a number of properties @xcite .    in the present paper , we combine all - electron spin - unrestricted ccsd(t)f12 calculations with frozen - core fci calculations to yield a highly accurate best estimate of the li ",
    "lih interaction potential .",
    "we also compare the f12 interaction energies with results obtained from standard ( not explicitly correlated ) ccsd(t ) calculations .",
    "we then characterize the ground - state potential , analyze possible interactions with excited states , and investigate channels for reactive collisions .",
    "we have calculated the interaction energies between the lithium atom and the lithium hydride molecule in jacobi coordinates ( @xmath12 ) , defined for the isotopic combination @xmath13li@xmath13li@xmath14h .",
    "calculations were performed for states of @xmath15 symmetry in the @xmath16 point group .",
    "the lih bond distance , @xmath17 , was initially kept frozen at the lih monomer equilibrium distance of 3.014 bohr @xcite .",
    "the distance @xmath18 between li and the center of mass of lih ranged from 3.0 to 10.0 bohr with an interval of 0.5 bohr , and then from 11.0 to 20.0 bohr with an interval of 1.0 bohr .",
    "additional distances of 30.0 , 40.0 , and 50.0 bohr were also used .",
    "the angle @xmath19 , between the vector pointing from li to h in the lih molecule and the vector pointing from the center of mass of the molecule to the li atom , was varied from @xmath20 to @xmath21 with an interval of @xmath22 ; @xmath23 corresponds to li ",
    "h  li configurations .",
    "we thus used a total of 28 intermonomer distances , @xmath18 , which combined with the 13 values of @xmath19 yielded 364 grid points on the two - dimensional interaction energy surface .    calculations with uncorrelated basis functions were carried out using the unrestricted version of the coupled - cluster model ccsd(t ) with dunning s cc - pv@xmath1z(-mid ) basis sets with @xmath24 d , t , q , 5 , where mid indicates the inclusion of an additional set of basis functions , the so - called midbond-95 set @xcite , placed at the middle of the li ",

    "additionally , for the purpose of comparison with the fci results ( see below ) , the frozen - core approximation ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals kept frozen ) was used for the cc - pvqz basis .",
    "all these calculations were carried out using the molpro package @xcite .",

    "f12 and ccsd(t)f12 @xcite calculations were carried out with the molpro code @xcite to establish the ccsd and ccsd(t ) basis - set limits for the lih  li interaction .",
    "we chose to use the f12b variant @xcite of the explicitly correlated spin - unrestricted energy implemented in the molpro code . employing the fixed - amplitude ansatz for the f12 wave function ensured the orbital invariance and size - consistency of the ccsd - f12 and ccsd(t)-f12 results .",
    "the qzvpp basis set @xcite was employed as the orbital basis in the f12 calculations .",
    "the corresponding qzvpp - jk basis set @xcite was used as the auxiliary basis for the density - fitting approximation @xcite for many - electron integrals , while the uncontracted version of the qzvpp - jk basis was used to approximate the resolution - of - identity in the f12 integrals @xcite .",
    "in addition , the valence correlation in the dimer was described with the full configuration interaction method ( fci ) .",
    "the fci and standard ccsd(t ) calculations in the frozen - core approximation were carried out using the cc - pvqz basis .",
    "the dalton package @xcite and the lucia program @xcite were combined to yield the fci results .    to calculate potential energy surface @xmath27 with the lih bond length kept fixed at its equilibrium value we used computational scheme which was previously applied in theoretical studies of the ground and excited states of the calcium dimer @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath27 was constructed according to the following expression : @xmath28 where @xmath29 contribution was obtained from all - electron ccsd(t)-f12 calculations , while the correction for the valence - valance correlation beyond the ccsd(t)-f12 level , @xmath30 , was calculated in an orbital cc - pvqz basis set .",
