    "when an exoplanet s orbital plane lies along our line of sight , the planet will transit its host star , periodically obscuring a small portion of the stellar disk and producing detectable dips in a photometric lightcurve .",
    "the first transits ( of a planet previously discovered by doppler ) were observed in 1999 @xcite .",
    "the first exoplanet to be detected with the transit technique was confirmed by doppler observations in 2002 @xcite . as of 18 october 2012 ,",
    "288 confirmed transiting planets in 233 systems have been reported @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission , operating since 2009 , has identified more than 2300 candidate transiting planets ( _ kepler _ objects of interest or kois ) ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b12 ) .",
    "although only a small fraction of kois have been confirmed , the false positive rate is thought to be low @xcite , but see @xcite .",
    "transit searches are more sensitive than doppler searches to the smallest planets because the transit signal scales with the square of the planet radius @xmath1 , while the doppler signal of a rocky planet scales approximately as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "_ kepler _ has already discovered 90 candidates possibly _ smaller _ than earth .",
    "transiting planets are of special interest because their radii can be estimated from the transit signal .",
    "if the transit is not grazing , the fractional decrease @xmath3 in the star s observed flux is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the stellar radius .",
    "a measurement of @xmath3 combined with knowledge of @xmath5 yields the planet radius . because the inclination of a transiting planet s orbit is near 90@xmath6",
    ", the mass of the planet can also be unambiguously established from doppler observations .",
    "combinations of mass and radius can be compared with predictions by models of interior structure @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy or spectrophotometry during transits can detect or rule out constituents in an atmosphere @xcite , and secondary eclipses ( occultations of the planet ) can constrain temperature and albedo @xcite .",
    "additional planets can be discovered by variation in transit times @xcite .",
    "analyses of large samples of transiting planets , including the catalog of kois , have attempted to ascertain properties of transiting planet populations , e.g. , whether they are segregated into discrete groups @xcite , the distribution with planet radius @xcite the dependence of planet occurrence on the metallicity of the host star @xcite , the effect of stellar irradiance on giant planet radius @xcite , and the occurrence of planets compared to doppler surveys @xcite . in the case of _ kepler _ , lack of doppler confirmation for most candidate planets as well as detailed spectroscopic characterization of the stars make it important to properly account for any systematic effects or biases .",
    "detection of a planet in a transit survey depends on the properties of the planet , most notably @xmath1 ( equation [ eqn.depth ] ) , but also on the orbital period because it determines the number of transits that are observed and the total transit signal .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite pointed out that transit - selected samples are biased toward large planets on short - period orbits .",
    "these biases can be extreme in ground - based surveys which suffer correlated ( `` red '' ) noise from variations in atmospheric transmission and discontinuous observing windows .",
    "equation [ eqn.depth ] also shows that planets of a given radius will be more readily detected around smaller stars .",
    "this has , in part , motivated transit searches for planets around m dwarf stars @xcite . in this case",
    ", a property of the host star , as opposed to the planet , influences the likelihood that a transiting planet will be detected , and that both star and planet will be included in a transit - selected sample .",
    "thus a selection effect will act on stellar radius , or on any property that is related to stellar radius , such as metallicity .",
    "this will produce systematic offsets or biases in the properties of stars hosting known transiting planets relative to the properties of the target sample .",
    "the construction of a target catalog itself can also produce selection effects in a transit survey .",
    "most notable among constraints on target stars is an apparent magnitude limit because of a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) requirement , or the need to confirm candidate transiting systems using doppler observations .",
    "a magnitude limit will cause ( malmquist ) bias towards more luminous stars ; these can be included to larger distances and hence sample a larger volume of space . at a given",
    "effective temperature , luminosity is uniquely related to stellar radius , and hence this is also a bias towards larger stars that , unmitigated , will affect the detection of planets and estimates of their radii .",
    "some of these effects would disappear or could be corrected if stellar parameters , i.e. radius , were precisely established .",
    "but , up to now , the large scale of transit surveys ( @xmath7 stars ) has precluded such determinations .",
    "neither radius nor mass are directly observable for distant , single stars such as _ kepler _ targets .",
    "the properties of most _ kepler _ stars have been inferred by comparing stellar models to the broad - band photometry of the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter br11 ) .",
    "few spectra and almost no parallax ( distance ) measurements are available , and most stars have only upper limits on proper motion .",
    "kic estimates of stellar radii have large uncertainties due to ( i ) errors in photometry ; ( ii ) degeneracies between stellar parameters and colors ; and ( iii ) errors in the models themselves . while kic estimates of stellar effective temperature are comparatively robust , those of surface gravity ( @xmath8 ) and metallicity ( fe / h ) are not as reliable ( br11 ) .",
    "br11 concluded that no gravity or radius information could be inferred for stars hotter than 5400  k ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the kic and astroseismic radii of 500 solar - type stars have random discrepancies of order 50% and a systematic offset of about the same amount .",
    "@xcite found a similar scatter but negligible systematic offset in @xmath8 ( and hence the radius ) of 93 solar - type _ kepler _ stars .",
    "@xcite found that many m - type stars that were classified as dwarfs or were unclassified in the kic are actually evolved stars .",
    "selection effects acting on uncertainties in stellar radius will bias the observed properties of planet - hosting stars with respect to their true distributions .",
    "for example , while essentially all m - type hosts of kois are _ bona fida _ dwarf stars @xcite , the vast majority of the bright ( @xmath10 ) targets and some fainter stars are giants @xcite .",
    "this disparity is a result of the strong selection effect on stellar radius described above ; planets are far more difficult to detect around giant stars due to their large size and higher variability @xcite .",
    "because of the relation between planet radius and stellar radius ( equation [ eqn.depth ] ) , estimates of planet radius will likewise be affected .    here",
    ", we quantify five effects produced by selection bias and uncertainties in stellar parameters in the _ kepler _ survey . in section [ sec.scaling ]",
    "we derive useful scaling relationships for selection effects on transiting planet detection and target star selection . in section [ sec.kepler ]",

    "we describe the effect of malmquist bias on the magnitude - limited _ kepler _ target catalog and the preferential inclusion of more luminous , larger stars , thus biasing downwards the radius of some kois . in section [ sec.metallicity ]",
    "we estimate the bias towards lower metallicity among koi - hosting stars as a consequence of the relationship between stellar metallicity and radius on the main sequence . in section",
    "[ sec.inflated ] we describe how uncertainties in stellar radius produce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar luminosity , potentially affecting statistics describing the relationship between `` inflated '' giant planets and stellar irradiation .",
    "in section [ sec.shrunken ] we consider the effect of stellar metallicity on transit depth and the interpretation of any correlation between metallicity and the radii of giant planets .",
    "we summarize our results and describe current and future efforts to better determine the parameters of _ kepler _ stars in section [ sec.discussion ] .",
    "in a transit survey , selection bias acts on a quantity @xmath11 ( a stellar or planetary parameter ) when the probability @xmath12 that a star is included in the survey , or that a planet is detected transiting a star , depend on that parameter .",
    "this bias is superposed on any real correlations and will persist to the extent that the values of the parameter and its effect on inclusion or detection are imperfectly quantified .",
    "the bias @xmath13 is the difference between the observed mean @xmath14 and the intrinsic mean @xmath15 , or @xmath16 where the brackets represent marginalizing over the population of stars , subject to any constraints . to derive useful scaling relations",
    ", we chose apparent brightness ( magnitude ) and effective temperature @xmath17 as independently varying parameters .",
    "the first fixes the noise level against which a transit must be detected .",
    "morever , the _ kepler _ target catalog is magnitude - limited @xcite . among main sequence stars , @xmath17 is closely related to mass , an important parameter of planet populations @xcite . unlike other stellar parameters",
    ", it can be robustly estimated from kic photometry ( br11 , * ? ? ?",
    "effective temperature is thus a convenient plotting parameter which minimizes complications due to variation in the planet population along the main sequence .",
    "nevertheless , values of @xmath17 do _ not _ map to unique values of stellar mass because stars have different ages and metallicities and plots with @xmath17 the dependence on mass should be considered `` blurred '' .",
    "calculations using stellar models , as described below , explicitly take into account the effects of age and metallicity .",
    "we first estimate the probability @xmath12 that a star is included in a catalog of transiting systems .",
    "the probability of detecting a planet is calculated as a function of both stellar properties ( radius and mass @xmath5 and @xmath18 ) and planet properties ( radius @xmath1 and orbital period @xmath19 ) , and then marginalized over planet properties using an appropriate distribution function .",
    "this yields @xmath12 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath18 .",
    "equation [ eqn.bias ] can then evaluated using a stellar model that describes the intrinsic distributions of these parameters and their relations to other observables . in",
    "many instances we can use scaling relations rather than exact relations becaue equation [ eqn.bias ] is normalized .",
    "we adopted a double power - law for the intrinsic distribution @xmath20 of planets with radius and orbital period @xcite : @xmath21 for @xmath19 larger than some minimum value @xmath22 where planets are found .",
    "transit detection depends on the geometric probability that the planet is on a transiting orbit , as well as the the signal ( depth ) of the transit relative to noise .    in the absence of coherent or `` red '' noise from the atmosphere ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of a single transit is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total number of photons detected during the event . in an observation interval @xmath25 about @xmath26 transits will be observed , bringing the total number of photons to @xmath27",
    ". therefore the signal - to - noise ratio of the co - added transits is @xmath28 at a given apparent brightness , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the transit duration .",
    "when the transit impact parameter is low and the transit chord is close to the stellar diameter , @xmath31 . assuming a near - circular orbit , the transverse velocity @xmath32 can be expressed in terms of the orbital period and mass of the star and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we derive a scaling relation between snr and planet / star properties by substituting @xmath30 for @xmath24 in equation [ eqn.snr0 ] and ignoring constant factors : @xmath35 solving for @xmath1 gives a scaling relation for the radius of the smallest planet on a given orbital period that can be detected at a fixed snr threshold : @xmath36 likewise , there is a relation for the maximum orbital period at which a planet of a given radius @xmath1 can be detected at a fixed snr threshold : @xmath37 @xmath38 is a sensitive function of @xmath1 , underscoring why transit surveys are highly biased towards the largest planets @xcite .    to obtain the observed distribution @xmath12 of planets with @xmath5 and @xmath18 , we multiply the intrinsic distribution ( equation [ eqn.distribution ] ) by the geometric probability that a planets is on a transiting orbit . for circular orbits",
    "this is proportional to the ratio of the stellar radius to orbital semimajor axis @xmath39 which , based on newtonian orbital dynamics , scales as @xmath40 .",
    "the observed planet distribution is : @xmath41 we marginalize equation [ eqn.observed ] over both @xmath19 and @xmath1 , first integrating from @xmath22 to @xmath38 .",
    "the maximum period is also limited by the observing window and the requirement that more than one transit must be observed , e.g. @xmath42 .",
    "integration of @xmath43 in equation [ eqn.observed ] yields a factor proportional to @xmath44 . if @xmath45 , then equation [ eqn.pmax ] , is used to re - express this as @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 is the radius of the smallest planet that can be detected at @xmath48 , i.e. that can be detected at all ) .",
    "integration of equation [ eqn.observed ] over @xmath49 from @xmath47 to @xmath50 produces : @xmath51 were @xmath52 .",
    "because the @xmath22 factor and the integral depend only on @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are planet population parameters and not stellar properties , they can be ignored when calculating biases in stellar properties .",
    "substituting for @xmath47 and retaining only factors that depend on stellar properties , @xmath55 all else being equal , planets are more likely to be detected around stars with smaller radii ( because transit depths are larger ) and/or lower masses ( because transit durations are longer ) .",
    "smaller stars are thus more likely to appear in a transit - selected sample . in the case of mass - radius relation @xmath56 for zero - age solar - type stars @xcite and a planet radius distibution power - law index @xmath57 @xcite , then @xmath58 .",
    "this is simply a statement that smaller ( and more ) planets can be detected around lower mass stars .",
    "older stars will have a steeper mass - radius relation , and as a result the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath18 will be more pronounced .    at a given apparent brightness ( observed flux ) ,",
    "the quantity @xmath59 is fixed , where @xmath60 is the stellar surface brightness in the bandpass of interest and @xmath61 is the distance to the star .",
    "substituting , @xmath62 into equation [ eqn.occur ] , and assuming that the planet population is distance - independent so that the distance factor can be moved outside the period and radius integrals , the scaling relation for observed occurrence becomes : @xmath63 if @xmath64 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , closer and hotter host stars are more likely to be included in transit - selected samples .",
    "stellar age and metallicity , which affect the relationships between stellar mass , radius , and surface brightness , are also biased as a result .",
    "a correlation between stellar properties and distance can modulate the degree of this bias .",
    "for example , if more distant stars tend to be more evolved along the main sequence and thus hotter , the bias will be less than if @xmath61 and @xmath60 are independent .",
    "equation [ eqn.occur2 ] does not consider that star of a certain mass or radius may be _ over - represented _ in the parent population : this is discussed in the next section .",
    "the target catalogs of transit surveys such as _ kepler _ are selected using a number of criteria , and chief among these is apparent magnitude .",
    "a magnitude - limited sample of stars will be biased towards the most luminous objects , which will be included to greater distances @xcite .",
    "these stars may be either more massive , more evolved , or both . at a given @xmath17 and thus fixed surface brightness @xmath60 ( ignoring the weak dependence of surface brightness on gravity and metallicity ) ,",
    "the signal @xmath24 from a star during a transit will scale as @xmath65 . modifying equation [ eqn.snr0 ] appropriately , we find that the transit signal - to - noise ratio scales as @xmath66 the smallest planet that can be detected at a given snr will scale as @xmath67 multiplying a power - law distribution of planet radii ( equation [ eqn.distribution ] ) by the probability that a planet is on a transiting orbit ( @xmath68 ) and integrating over all planet radii down to @xmath69 gives the relation @xmath70 at a fixed color / temperature / surface brightness @xmath60 , a magnitude - limited survey will include stars of radius @xmath5 out to a distance @xmath71 .",
    "assuming , for the moment , that transits can be detected to arbitrarily large distances , then integrating equation [ eqn.number ] over a homogeneous volume of radius @xmath72 yields @xmath73 for @xmath57 and at a given @xmath19 , @xmath12 scales as @xmath74 .",
    "this relation illustrates how larger , more evolved stars can be preferentially included in a transit - selected sample despite the fact that transits of these stars are more difficult to detect .",
    "although target stars in a magnitude - limited sample will be included to a distance @xmath71 , a planet of radius @xmath1 can only be detected to a distance @xmath75 where , according to equation [ eqn.snr2 ] , @xmath76 the detection limit decreases with @xmath5 while the inclusion limit @xmath72 _ increases _ with @xmath5 .",
    "these limits coincide ( @xmath77 ) at a stellar radius @xmath78 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a constant factor , @xmath19 is in days , @xmath49 is in earth radii and @xmath18 is in solar masses .",
    "( we calculate values of of @xmath80 for the _ kepler _ survey in section [ sec.malmquist ] . )",
    "detections of planets of a given size around stars with @xmath81 is magnitude - limited and subject to a stellar radius bias that scales as @xmath82 , because the sample volume increases as @xmath83 and the transit probability increases as @xmath5 . for stars with @xmath84 , a survey is limited to a volume propoortional to @xmath85 ( see equation [ eqn.small ] ) , and the bias scales as @xmath86 , a weak dependence on @xmath5 in the opposite sense .",
    "the critical stellar radius @xmath78 is most sensitive to planet radius and the dependence on period and stellar mass is weak .",
    "to evaluate biases and selection effects in the _ kepler _ survey we modeled target stars with isochrones from the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite interpolated onto a 0.1-dex grid of metallicities using the on - line tool . for each star",
    ", we compared adjusted kic parameters ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 [ fe / h ] ) to model predictions using bayesian statistics .",
    "specifically , we calculated a probability or weight @xmath90 for each model according to : @xmath91}p(m_*)p(t_*)p({\\mathcal f})p(\\zeta),\\ ] ] where parameters with a `` hat '' are the dartmouth model values and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are the priors for initial stellar mass ( initial mass function , imf ) , age , metallicity , and a modified distance modulus @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the galactic latitude .",
    "the modified distance modulus accounts for the finite dispersion of stars above the plane of the milky way , but neglects the vertical displacement of the sun .",
    "we used an sdss @xmath98-band modulus @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the observed apparent magnitude and @xmath101 is the absolute magnitude from the dartmouth models .",
    "we ignored interstellar extinction , which will be @xmath102 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "( while estimation of stellar parameters is sensitive to interstellar _ reddening _ , the amount of interstellar _ extinction _ is small compared to the uncertainties in the distance modulus . )",
    "estimates of @xmath17 and [ fe / h ] from the kic were adjusted by -100  k and 0.17 dex , respectively and we used @xmath103  k , @xmath104  dex , and @xmath105  dex , based on a comparison of kic values with those spectroscopic values listed in b12 .    for priors we adopted the @xcite imf , and a uniform age distribution over 1 - 13 gyr .",
    "the latter corresponds to a constant rate of star formation since the advent of the galactic disk @xcite , but ignores the youngest stars , around which planets are more difficult to detect .",
    "the metallicity distribution of _ kepler _ target stars is unknown and may be complex ; the field is not parallel to the galactic plane and may include members of a metal - poor `` thick disk '' population @xcite .",
    "we used the metallicity distribution predicted by the the trilegal stellar population model @xcite as a prior .",
    "stars in the direction of the center of the _ kepler _ field ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) were simulated to a cutoff magnitude @xmath108 . when compared to 2mass counts ,",
    "trilegal counts agree with observations at least down to @xmath109 , but fail at @xmath110 , possibly due to incorrectly modeled bulge red giant branch stars and dust @xcite .",
    "however , the kepler field cuts off at @xmath111 and and only 18 of the 84 ccd centers lie at @xmath112 .",
    "the ( mostly default ) values for trilegal parameters are listed in table [ tab.params ] .",
    "trilegal also reports a value of @xmath113 for each simulated star and we used these to construct a prior distribution of @xmath114 .",
    "our priors are relaxed in the sense they only exclude very unlikely masses , ages , or metallicities .",
    "it is also possible to impose priors on the stellar parameters @xmath17 and @xmath8 using the predictions of a stellar population model , but we consider such predictions too uncertain to justify this approach",
    ".    for each star , equation [ eqn.weight ] returns an array of values for @xmath90 corresponding to the grid of dartmouth models .",
    "most values of @xmath90 are negligibly small and the corresponding models were ignored . from the remainder ,",
    "the most probable ( highest @xmath90 ) model and accompanying parameters such as @xmath5 were identified .",
    "statistics of the distribution of possible values were calculated , e.g : @xmath115 because the distributions can be very non - gaussian , we defined the fractional uncertainty in a stellar parameter to be one - half of the range encompassing 68% of the total probability ( normalized @xmath90 ) divided by the most probable value .",
    "we found that uncertainties in the radii of late g- and k - type dwarf stars hosting kois is typically @xmath11615% , but are substantialy higher ( @xmath117% ) among some f- and g - type stars because of the coincidence of the dwarf and ( sub)giant branches ( figure [ fig.radunc ] ) .",
    "evolved stars ( i.e. kic @xmath118 ) also have comparatively larger uncertainties .",
    "the cluster of putative m `` dwarfs '' with radius uncertainties of @xmath11625% might be misclassified giant stars @xcite .",
    "our estimated uncertainties are certainly lower bounds because ( 1 ) the errors in the stellar parameters @xmath17 , [ fe / h ] , and especially @xmath119 are themselves not gaussian - distributed , as presumed in equation [ eqn.weight ] ; and ( 2 ) we do not consider errors in the dartmouth models themselves .",
    "eddington bias occurs when errors in measurement scatter more frequent values in a population to less frequent values at a higher rate than the reverse process .",
    "this systematically inflates the observed frequency of rare members @xcite . because the distribution of planets with radius is a steep power law @xcite , errors in radius ( fractional standard deviation @xmath120 ) will bias the number of larger planets upwards",
    "this will inflate the rate of planet occurrence @xmath12 above a given cutoff in radius @xmath121 .",
    "planets with radius @xmath49 will appear to be larger than the cutoff if the error in stellar radius is larger than @xmath122 .",
    "if errors in stellar radius are gaussian - distributed , the fraction of stars that satisfy that condition is @xmath123 .",
    "the fractional upward bias in planet occurrence is the integral of this function with the normalized planet radius distribution , minus the intrinsic occurrence ( normalized to unity ) : @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126 increases with @xmath120 and , if @xmath57 , reaches 18% when @xmath127% .",
    "we estimated the amount of eddington bias in the apparent radius distribution of kois using the procedures described in section [ sec.methods ] .",
    "for each koi we calculated the likelihood weight @xmath90 ( equation [ eqn.weight ] ) for all possible stellar models consistent using the parameters of the host star .",
    "corresponding to each model we calculated a revised planet radius @xmath128 , where @xmath1 is the radius from b12 , @xmath129 is the model stellar radius and @xmath5 is the stellar radius of the maximum likelihood model ( highest @xmath90 ) .",
    "the radius distribution , weighted by @xmath90 , is summed over all koi host stars and normalized .",
    "this is compared to the observed distribution of @xmath1 ( figure [ fig.eddington ] ) .",
    "the latter is not the _ intrinsic _ distribution , which must account for the probability that a planet transits and is detected @xcite .",
    "as expected , eddington bias increases the apparent number of neptune - size and larger planets .",
    "the bias is 17% above @xmath130 , demarcated by the vertical dashed line in figure [ fig.eddington ] , where the normalized distributions are equal .",
    "the bias also suppresses the peak in the distribution at a jupiter radius .",
    "corollaries of these results are that the actual occurrence rate of neptune - size planets is smaller than previously reported ( * ? ? ? *",
    "i.e. ) , and that the intrinsic peak at @xmath131 is more pronounced than is apparent .",
    "in addition , eddington bias decreases the apparent slope in the radius distribution ( figure [ fig.eddington ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the observed turnover in the number of planets smaller than @xmath132 , and whether more large planets are scattered to smaller radii than vice versa .",
    "_ kepler _ observations are incomplete for @xmath133 and while the intrinsic radius distribution of planets is presumed to turn over , the radius at which this actually occurs is not known and awaits a better understanding of the efficiency of _ kepler _ detection of small signals .",
    "if the turnover below @xmath134 is real , then the intrinsic slope of the radius distribution is _ steeper _ than observed ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "but if a scale - free power - law distribution continues to much smaller radii , then eddington bias affects the magnitude , but not the slope of the distribution .    we simulated eddington bias on artificial samples of planets with radii drawn from a power - law distribution with variable index @xmath53 .",
    "these radii replaced actual koi estimates in a repeat of the analysis described above .",
    "the power - law index of the binned apparent distribution @xmath135 above some minimum radius @xmath136 is calculated by maximum likelihood : @xmath137 , where the summation is over all @xmath138 . as expected ,",
    "while eddington bias significantly increases the fraction of planets with @xmath139 , the power - law index is relatively unchanged ( figure [ fig.eddington2 ] ) .",
    "malmquist bias is the preferential inclusion of intrinsically luminous objects in a magnitude - limited survey due to the rapid increase in sampling volume @xmath140 with distance @xmath72 to which an object is included . among large , readily - detected objects ( planets ) in a magnitude - limited transit survey , the bias is even greater ( @xmath141 ) because the probability of a transiting geometry is proprtional to @xmath5 which , at a given effective temperature , scales with @xmath72 ( see section [ sec.targetbias ] ) . at a given apparent magnitude and planet radius ,",
    "there is a maximum stellar radius @xmath142 to which a survey is essentially complete , i.e. not limited by the snr of a transit event .",
    "we estimated @xmath78 as a function of @xmath1 by establishing the detection limit at different _ kepler _ magnitudes .",
    "the _ kepler _ target catalog was constructed with different criteria for stars with @xmath10 and @xmath143 @xcite ; it is probably nearly complete for dwarf stars to @xmath144 but only includes selected dwarfs with @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "we adopted a snr limit of 7.1 and an observation period of 487  d ( b12 ) . to estimate the noise of a typical dwarf star we performed a polynomial fit to a running median ( @xmath145 ) of 3  hr combined differential photometric precision ( cdpp ) values for _ kepler _ targets with @xmath146 , presumed mostly dwarfs .",
    "this gave an estimate of the intrinsic 3  hr rms noise level as a function of @xmath147 ; @xmath148 the median noise at @xmath149 is 54 ppm .",
    "we performed a similar analysis on stars with kic @xmath118 , presumably subgiants and giants , that constitute a locus of comparatively `` noisy '' targets , and found : @xmath150 for @xmath144 dwarfs , @xmath151 and at @xmath152 , @xmath153 . at @xmath144 ,",
    "for a median orbital period @xmath154  d and @xmath155 , malmquist bias favors stars as large as @xmath156 . at @xmath108 , only stars with @xmath157 are favored because of higher noise at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the situation is more extreme for giant planets ( @xmath158 ) , where malmquist bias will favor evolved stars as large as 10 - 20@xmath159 , presuming giant planets exist around such stars , as we discuss below .",
    "bias towards larger stars , coupled with uncertainties in stellar radius , leads to underestimates of stellar - and hence planetary - radii .",

    "about two - thirds of all koi - hosting stars , and the vast majority of those hosting planets smaller than neptune have predicted malmquist bias values @xmath010% . however , the majority of larger planets may have significantly underestimated radii , some by a factor of two . this dichotomy occurs because _ kepler _ detection of large planets is limited by the magnitude limit of the target catalog , not the snr of transit .",
    "we emphasize that these calculations are _ statistical _ , i.e. we are calculating the expectation values of probability distributions with stellar radius , and that actual errors will vary .",
    "nevertheless , the host stars of many giant planets may be more larger , more distant , and more luminous , and the radii of their planets may be significantly underestimated .",

    "the bias is small ( mean of -0.017 among dwarfs ) for the following reasons : ( i ) the geometric transit probability is proportional to stellar radius and thus increases with metallicity , countering the effect of metallicity on transit depth ; and ( ii ) the effect of metallicity on stellar radius is most pronounced among comparatively rare subdwarfs but has only a modest effect around solar metallicity , especially for the coolest stars @xcite .      at the time",

    "the paucity of kois with inflated radii ( @xmath173 ) in the low irradiance region ( upper right hand domain of figure [ fig.radirr ] ) supports the contention that the inflation of giant planets is related to stellar irradiation or planet equilibrium temperature .",

    "she interpreted the decline as evidence that giant planets around metal - rich stars have larger solid cores and , for the same total planet mass , smaller radii @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig.depth ] is an updated version of figure 1 in dr12 based on the more recent release of kois with revised radii @xcite .",
    "it includes 225 kois with @xmath199 and host stars with kic - determined metallicities . as in figure 1 from dr12 , a running median ( @xmath200 )",
    "is plotted .",
    "the kendall @xmath30 correlation coefficient is -0.032 , indicating no signficant correlation ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "we were unable to reproduce the result of dr12 by simple cuts on this sample to approximate the earlier koi sample , perhaps because many stellar radii ( and hence planet radii ) have been revised @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that the values of [ fe / h ] in the kic are no more accurate than @xmath2020.3 dex ( br11 ) .",
    "irrespective of any physical phenomenon , one would expect to observe a decrease in @xmath198 with increasing metallicity simply because metal - rich dwarfs tend to be larger than metal - poor dwarfs , and hence transit depths will be smaller ( equation [ eqn.depth ] ) .",
    "we modeled this effect with 10000 monte carlo realizations of the koi catalog .",
    "there are two effects from increasing the radii of the host stars of a given planet population :",
    "one is that transit depths will become smaller and the planets will appear to be smaller .",
    "the other is that some planets may fall below the lower radius cutoff ( 5@xmath192 ) and be excluded from the analysis .",
    "the reverse is true for lower metallicity ; planets appear larger and a few planets may exceed the maximum cutoff ( 20@xmath192 ) .",
    "we therefore considered kois over a broader ( 3 - 25@xmath192 ) range of radii , adopted this sample as representing the intrinsic ( `` true '' ) distribution of radii , estimated their apparent radii from the radius of the star and transit depth , and then applied the same radius criteria as dr12 .",
    "we randomly shuffled the planet population among the host stars , thus destroying any intrinsic radius - metallicity correlation , computed the radii of the stars using the dartmouth stellar evolution models , and re - calculated the transit depths .",
    "each monte carlo host star was assigned the corrected @xmath17 of the actual star it replaced .",
    "we assigned an _ observed _ metallicity based on the kic value , a systematic correction @xmath203 of 0.17 dex ( br11 ) , a random normally - distributed error @xmath185 of 0.3 dex , and a prior distribution of _ intrinsic _ metallicities that is a guassian with mean @xmath204 and standard deviation @xmath205 .",
    "this is equivalent to drawing metallicities from a single normal distribution with mean @xmath206 and standard deviation @xmath207 .",
    "the radius of each monte carlo star was taken to be the median of all model radii with @xmath146 ( presuming they are dwarf stars ) , [ fe / h ] within 0.15 dex of the monte carlo model , and @xmath17 within 100  k. we did not apply any age criterion other than 1 - 13  gyr .",
    "we then calculated @xmath198 using the shuffled planet radius and the median model radius stellar radius . for each monte carlo sample , we calculated kendall s @xmath30 and false positive probability for a correlation between the _ observed _ metallicities and the artificial transit depths .",
    "median - filtered ( @xmath208 ) curves from these monte carlo realizations typically show a decline of @xmath198 with increasing metallicity .",
    "figure [ fig.tau ] shows the distribution of @xmath30 from 10000 null realizations .",
    "the value of @xmath30 from the actual koi sample is plotted as the dashed line .",
    "61.6% of these null realizations produce a significant ( @xmath209 ) correlation and 71.6% of values are below ( and thus more significant than ) the actual value of -0.032 . for comparison",
    "the dr12 value is -0.17 .",
    "thus , negative correlations between metallicity and @xmath198 are to be expected soley as a consequence of the metallicity - radius relation of stars , although these monte carlo simulations indicate that there is a @xmath11640% chance that random errors in kic [ fe / h ] values would prevent such a correlation from being detected .",
    "we have shown that selection effects for both transiting planets , and the target stars of transit surveys , combined with uncertainties in stellar radii , can bias the properties of host stars and their planets .",
    "these effects are in addition to those previously identified by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which concern effects arising from the sensitivity of detection efficiency to planet radius and period .",
    "we have analyzed the effects of these systematics on the _ kepler _ survey and its catalogs of target stars and candidate planets , using current models of stellar evolution and galactic stellar populations to infer the properties of _ kepler _ stars .",
    "we did not apply constraints from the relation between stellar density , transit duration , and orbital period because the relation also depends on unknown orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron , and is not applicable to non - koi stars .",
    "we found that eddington bias from the steep distribution of kois with radius results in an overestimation of the overall frequency of planets with @xmath210 by about 15 - 20% of the actual value .",
    "we also find that eddington bias acts to soften the `` bump '' in the distribution at jupiter - size planets .",
    "this leads us to predict that the intrinsic peak at that radius is more pronounced .",
    "the effect on the distribution of smaller planets depends on whether the turnover in the radius distribution below 2@xmath192 is real , or the result of incompleteness .",
    "if the former , eddington bias acts to flatten the apparent slope of the radius distribution , and in this case we predict that the actual slope is steeper than the @xmath57 power - law . otherwise , the effect of eddington bias on the power - law index is about 0.1 .",
    "we made statistical estimates of malmquist bias as a consequence of the magnitude limit of the target catalog .",
    "the estimated bias for two - thirds of koi systems , including most kois smaller than neptune , is @xmath211% .",
    "however , we found that bias is more prevalent and pronounced ( up to a factor of two in radius ) among larger candidate planets and their host stars , resulting from detection of these systems being governed by the apparent magnitude limit of the target catalog , rather than the snr of transit detection .",
    "a malmquist bias towards more luminous stars raises the possibility of inclusion of unidentified evolved stars within the _ kepler _ target catalog ( in addition to a number of deliberately selected and clearly identified giant stars ) .",
    "nominally , stars with large radii were removed by a vetting process that used a criterion of _ kepler _ detection of a @xmath134 planet @xcite .",
    "however , kic - derived stellar radii are based on estimates of log  @xmath163 and many of these are problematic .",
    "kic photometry provides no information for the gravity of stars with @xmath212k ( @xmath213 ) , and subgiants would be assigned erroneously high log  @xmath163 ( br11 ) .",
    "there are bona fida subgiants hosting kois , e.g. the f5 subgiant hd 179070 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of stars hosting candidate giant planets has revealed other instances in which subgiants were misclassified as cooler , main sequence dwarfs in the kic .",
    "@xcite report a hot - jupiter - hosting f - type subgiant ( @xmath214 , @xmath215 ) .",
    "based on spectra , they estimate @xmath216 , which is in contrast to its kic value of 4.55 .",
    "likewise , the host of koi-423b , assigned @xmath217 in the kic , is an f7iv subgiant with @xmath218 @xcite .",
    "three of five undiluted eclipsing binaries identified by @xcite as false positives among _ kepler _ giant planet candidates have masses larger than 1 m@xmath219 , and one of these is definitely an evolved star .",
    "the mean difference between 190 pairs of kic and spectroscopic values of @xmath8 reported in @xcite is only 0.02  dex ( standard deviation of 0.36  dex ) .",
    "nevertheless , astroseismically - derived @xmath8 values average 0.05 - 0.17  dex lower than kic values and astroseismically - determined radii are up to 50% larger @xcite .    among koi - hosting stars",
    "whose radius has been underestimated , small planets may actually be larger , even jupiter - size planets . in turn ,",
    "giant `` planets '' may turn out to be diluted or undiluted stellar companions , a significant source of astrophysical false positives in transit surveys @xcite . based on a preliminary doppler survey",
    ", @xcite estimated that about 40% of candidate giant planets are false positives and about one quarter of those are undiluted eclipsing binaries .",
    "this also means that estimates of the occurrence of jupiters on close - in orbits @xcite must be revised downwards .",
    "@xcite report that the occurrence of `` hot jupiters '' ( @xmath220  d ) in the _ kepler _ catalog is only half that seen in doppler surveys , and adjustment for a high false - positive rate would worsen this discrepancy .",
    "one explanation for the discrepancy between the _ kepler _ and doppler surveys might be the presence of misidentified subgiant stars in the _ kepler _ target catalog",
    ". the intrinsic distribution of planets may be different around evolved stars compared to main sequence stars .",
    "planets have been discovered around subgiant stars @xcite , but giant planets appear to be rare with 0.6  au ( @xmath221  d ) of clump gk giants @xcite - corot-21b may be an exception @xcite .",
    "the timescale of the decay of a planet s orbit due to dissipation of tides in a star s convective envelope scales as @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the mass of the envelope .",
    "hot jupiters are likely to be destroyed by infall and disruption inside the roche lobe as a star evolves off the main sequence , expands , and its convective envelopes thicken @xcite .",
    "thus , one explanation for the comparative paucity of hot jupiters in the koi catalog is that , because of malmquist bias , many _ kepler _ targets are older stars or subgiants for which hot jupiters can not be detected , have been miscategorized as neptunes , or have been destroyed by orbital decay .",
    "a comparison between the distributions of @xmath8 predicted by trilegal and that of the kic suggest no large ( @xmath22410% ) population of unidentified subgiants , however spectroscopy of candidate subgiants is needed to actually test this conjecture .",
    "we have shown that , because metal - poor stars tend to have smaller radii than their metal - rich counterparts , stars with transiting planets will be biased towards metal - poor members , independent of any correlation between planets and metallicity . however , we estimate that this metallicity bias is only about -0.02 dex and can be neglected .",
    "thus a comparison between the mean metallicity of stars with transiting planets and that of the overall target population is appropriate .",
    "the mean metallicity of m dwarfs with kois , -0.09 @xcite , and solar - type stars with small planets , -0.01 @xcite , appears similar to that of the solar neighborhood : @xcite report a mean metallicity of @xmath225 for a volume - limited local sample of m dwarfs using a photometric calibration , and @xcite report a median metallicity of -0.06 for all stars in the solar neighborhood . whether the overall",
    "_ kepler _ target population has a similar metallicity distribution is not yet known and additional observations are required . from our calculations",
    "we conclude that such a comparison would not suffer from significant metallicity bias , but must take into account a dilution factor because stars without transiting planets are not necessarily stars without planets .",
    "this dilution factor is large for a high planet occurrence @xcite .",
    "we have shown how uncertainties in stellar radius or distance produce correlated errors in a planet s radius and the radiation received from the host star .",
    "this effect can produce an artificial correlation in populations of planets where none exists .",
    "recently , such a correlation has been found in both ground - based transit surveys and the _ kepler _ catalog , and highlighted as a test of mechanisms to explain the `` inflation '' of giant planets on close - in orbits .",
    "we quantified the systematic effect of correlated errors in stellar radius in the case of the _ kepler _ kois and show that , despite this systematic , the result of d11 , i.e. that inflated planets are absent at low irradiance , is still significant . to maximize any systematic effect",
    ", we used a very broad range of metallicities ( -2.5 to + 0.5 ) and no constraint on stellar distance ( e.g. , from a model of galactic structure ) , thus further strengthening our conclusion .",
    "finally , we have shown how searches for trends of transiting planet radius with stellar properties may engender systematic errors unless the effect of those properties on apparent stellar radius - and hence planet radius - is taken into account .",
    "we examined the tentative ( 2.3@xmath185 ) claim of dr12 that giant planets around metal - rich stars tend to have smaller transit depths , because they are smaller and perhaps have larger rocky cores . performing a similar analysis on the most recent koi catalog",
    ", we were unable to reproduce that trend .",
    "moreover , we performed simulations that show that the trend observed by dr12 could be easily explained by the dependence of stellar radius on metallicity",
    ".    two limitations of our analysis are that ( i ) we have asssumed gaussian - distributed errors in the corrected kic parameters @xmath17 , @xmath8 , and [ fe / h ] , and ( ii ) that the construction of bayesian priors on mass , age , and metallicity treat them as independent variables .",
    "neither of these is absolutely correct ; the first assumption probably produces an underestimate of the uncertainty in stellar radius while the second assumption produces an overestimate of the uncertainty .",
    "of course , any inadequacies in the dartmouth stellar evolution models themselves are not accounted for .",
    "there are other systematics effects which may be present in transit surveys .",
    "two - thirds of solar - type ( f6-k3 ) stars are found in multiple systems @xcite . at the typical distance of _ kepler _ kois with solar - type hosts ( 950  pc ) , one 4 arc - second pix subtends about 3800  au , sufficient to include nearly all companions to primaries @xcite .",
    "the presence of an unresolved companion , or any background star , will dilute the transit signal .",
    "transits otherwise just above the detection threshold might be rendered invisible . as a consequence",
    ", members of multiple systems may be underrepresented among stars with transiting planets .",
    "for equal - mass binaries ( twins ) where the transit signal is lower by a factor of 2 , the fractional noise will decrease by @xmath226 ( due to the doubling of the signal compared to a comparable single star ) and thus the radius of the smallest detectable planet will increase by a factor of @xmath227 , or about 1.2 . for a power - law size distribution ( equation [ eqn.distribution ] ) , the number of detectable planets _ per star _ will decrease by a factor of @xmath228 , or 0.64 for @xmath229 .",
    "however , nearly - equal mass binaries represent only 12% of all binaries",
    "@xcite and systems with mass ratios @xmath230 and luminosity ratios @xmath231 , where the dilution will be much smaller , are the norm .",
    "star counts reach @xmath1161000  mag@xmath168  deg@xmath232 at @xmath233 , and so there is only a few % chance of significant dilution by an unrelated star . to the extent that stellar variability inhibits transit detection , younger , and more active stars will be also underrepresented among kois .    the best defense against the systematic errors we have described is better characterization of the target stars of transit surveys , especially those hosting planets .",
    "this will reduce , but not entirely eliminate , these biases .",
    "spectroscopic characterization and refinement of the properties of a fully representative sample of _ kepler _ target stars , not just the koi hosts , is vital to robust statistical analyses of the properties of transiting planets and their parent stars stars , and such programs are underway @xcite .",

    "<S> statistical analyses of large surveys for transiting planets such as the _ kepler _ mission must account for systematic errors and biases . </S>",
    "<S> transit detection depends not only on the planet s radius and orbital period , but also on host star properties . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a sample of stars with transiting planets may not accurately represent the target population . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , targets are selected using criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> these selection effects , combined with uncertainties in stellar radius , lead to biases in the properties of transiting planets and their host stars . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify possible biases in the _ kepler _ survey . </S>",
    "<S> first , eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius distribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15 - 20% overestimate of planet occurrence . </S>",
    "<S> second , the magnitude limit of the _ kepler _ target catalog induces malmquist bias towards large , more luminous stars and underestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets , especially those larger than neptune . </S>",
    "<S> third , because metal - poor stars are smaller , stars with detected planets will be very slightly ( @xmath00.02 dex ) more metal - poor than the target average . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , uncertainties in stellar radii produce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation . a previous finding </S>",
    "<S> , that highly - irradiated giant are more likely to have `` inflated '' radii , remains significant , even accounting for this effect . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , transit depth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of any intrinsic correlation , and a previous claim of a negative correlation between giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an artifact . </S>"
