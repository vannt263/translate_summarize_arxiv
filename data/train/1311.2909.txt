    "it has been shown repeatedly that the tsallis distribution gives an excellent description of @xmath5 collisions  @xcite resulting in a value for the @xmath1 parameter which is around 1.1 - 1.2 . in this paper",
    "we extend this analysis to transverse momentum spectra obtained in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath0 = 5.02 tev by the alice collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the tsallis distribution gives an excellent fit to @xmath6 collisions with values for @xmath1 and @xmath3 which are consistent with those obtained in @xmath5 collisions but with a temperature which is clearly higher , around 112 mev .",
    "in the framework of tsallis statistics  @xcite the entropy @xmath7 , the particle number , @xmath8 , the energy density @xmath9 and the pressure @xmath10 are given by integrals over the tsallis distribution : @xmath11^{-\\frac{1}{q-1 } } .\\label{tsallis}\\ ] ] it can be shown ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that the relevant thermodynamic quantities are given by : @xmath12 , \\label{entropy } \\\\ n & = & gv\\int\\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3 } f^q , \\label{number } \\\\",
