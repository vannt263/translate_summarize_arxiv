    "problem of assignment of the detected slowly - decaying spectral beats to either electronic coherences @xcite or molecular vibrations @xcite is under intense discussions up to now .",
    "however , it is still disputed whether such detachment is feasible at all .    molecules and their environment",
    "are characterized by a wide variety of high - frequency vibrational modes , some of them strongly - coupled to the electronic excitations .",
    "unambiguous experimental evidences that the high - frequency vibrational wavepacket motion causes the spectral beats in 2d spectra were reported only recently @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clearly established how these vibrational resonances map onto 2d spectra and how the excited vibrational wavepacket evolution affects the spectral dynamics .",
    "systems where the high - frequency vibrations are mixed with electronic transitions are currently of a special interest .",
    "great efforts are made to effectively and universally identify the underlying mechanisms @xcite .",
    "analysis of _ rephasing _ and _ nonrephasing _ signals of the 2d es separately could help solving this issue in some cases , but usually the strong spectral congestion leaves ambiguity of the result due to the overlap of many oscillating features . in case when the limited - bandwidth laser pulses can not cover the whole absorption spectrum",
    "even if the vibrational features are well - resolved , the intramolecular vibrations can still be evaluated by analyzing the phase relationships of beating patterns in the rephasing and nonrephasing signals , peak ellipticity or rotation of the nodal line of the imaginary part of the total 2d spectrum @xcite .",
    "non - decaying vibrations - related quantum beats on top of the vertical electronic transitions are obtained in simulated time - resolved spectra when molecular vibrations are included as coherent harmonic modes of the bath coupled to the system @xcite.this problem sometimes is formulated in pure quantum mechanical terminology by using so - called polaron transformation @xcite . as the vibrational coherence decay rate is usually smaller compared to those of the electronic coherences , this might also trigger the reconsideration of the nature of long - lived coherences observed in many systems .    in this paper",

    "one of the main simplification is achieved by neglecting the non - resonant transitions with respect to the optical field under consideration : in the case of the resonant excitation with the optical laser field a molecule is described as a system consisting of two electronic energy levels , while a supramolecular complex  as an aggregate of coupled two - level electronic systems .",
    "another standard assumption when describing electronic quantum levels of a molecule is the separation of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom ( the born - oppenheimer approximation ) .",
    "it is assumed that the electronic wavefunction rigorously follows the nuclear configuration and the energies of electronic levels become parametric functions of nuclear degrees of freedom .",

    "as it was already mentioned , the phase relationships and oscillation amplitudes of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 signals are huang - rhys factor - dependent , therefore , both correlation and anticorrelation of the diagonal peak - width and intensity is possible for different systems @xcite .",
    "however , the anticorrelation of the diagonal width and intensity of any peak in the 2d spectrum is not available for the electronic dimer @xcite . as follows from our calculations of a two - level system the amplitude is higher for the @xmath83 signal and , therefore , the correlation of the diagonal width and intensity of the main peak is observed both for damped and undamped vibrations .",
    "thus , spectral dynamics of the vibrational and electronic - only systems are very similar by this aspect .",
    "the monomer with damped vibrations being analyzed here is an illustration of the transition from damped to overdamped vibrations . due to damping , the main peak experiences only a few ` breaths ' and the round shape is established at @xmath119 at least ( fig .",
    "[ fig : real - parts - of]c ) . increasing",
    "the damping strength would destroy all vibrational coherences and it would not be possible to spectrally distinguish it from a general two - level system coupled to an overdamped bath .",
    "however , for a molecular dimer one can expect it to demonstrate similar spectral characteristics compared to the monomer with damped vibrations . indeed , this is true for the 2d spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : real - parts - of]a . due to the excited state absorption",
    ", a negative region below the main peak appears for short population times . the oscillation pattern of the peak maximum ( green dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : real - parts - of]d - f ) closely resembles the dependence of the monomer with damped vibrations ( black solid line ) , as well .",
    "the decay rates of the signals are very similar here , but the established values of peak intensities at long population times are different .",
    "this can be explained by the additional dephasing mechanisms ( exciton transfer and lifetime decay ) available for an excitonic system during @xmath82 .",
    "consideration of high - frequency _ damped _ molecular vibrations instead of _ undamped _ is a more realistic description since it includes dephasing and dissipation that vibronic motion experiences in solvent .",
    "this correction induces non - uniform peak broadening , changes the position of peaks within the vibrational progression in the absorption and results in decay of coherences in the 2d spectrum .",
    "the significance of the effect depends on the width of the spectral density function around the resonance .",
    "therefore , having the coherence decay rate and the peak broadening quantitatively evaluated from the experiment , one would be able to estimate the damping parameters of vibrations .    a model of _ overdamped _",
    "_ quantum _ bath is suggested in this paper .",
    "it is represented by the spectral density , which is directly obtained from the quantum - mechanical correlation function of bath coordinates and not assuming the classical correlation function as in the _ overdamped semi - classical _ bath model .",
    "the spectral density of the overdamped quantum bath decays as @xmath120 at large frequencies , which is preferable to @xmath121 used in overdamped semi - classical model .",
    "in two - dimensional photon echo signals , it results in increased homogeneous broadening of peaks .",
    "dynamics of quantum beats is not affected by this spectral density ; however , the ratio of rephasing and non - rephasing signals changes , as well as peak intensities .",
    "damping of vibrations causes the decay of coherences ; its influence on the peak shape and correlation / anticorrelation of the diagonal peak width and intensity is reported to be insignificant compared to the description of undamped vibrations .",
    "further increase of the damping strength results in instantaneous disappearance of vibrational coherences and this limit corresponds to purely overdamped vibrational motion .",
    "this research was partially funded by the european social fund under the global grant measure ."
