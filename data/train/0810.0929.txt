    "experiments with tunnel junctions using ferromagnetic metals@xcite have been an interesting topic since a long time .",
    "this subject has grown again@xcite because of the new field of spintronics where spin dependent currents are an important requisite of many possible devices.prinz , boeck this implies that control and measurements of spin polarized currents are needed .",
    "spin - polarized electron tunnelling@xcite is a key tool to measure the current polarization and to understand the physics involved in these effects .",
    "most of the recent experimental works have focused on the suppression of the andreev reflection and have used the point contact geometry with a superconducting electrode@xcite . however",
    "the local information extracted by point contact or scanning tunnelling microscope techniques seems to be less suitable for devices than planar tunneling junctions .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic difficulty of fabricating a perfect uniform oxide layer can jeopardize the latter technique .",
    "recently kim and moodera@xcite have reported a large spin polarization of 0.25 from polycrystalline and epitaxial ni ( 111 ) films using meservey and tedrows s technique@xcite and standard al electrode and oxide barriers , that allows for an almost ideal barrier behaviour .    in this work",
    "we show that the current polarization of ferromagnets can be extracted without applying a magnetic field to the junction and using an oxide barrier that is far from ideal .",
    "the experimental data are obtained for nb / nb@xmath2o@xmath3/ni planar tunnel junctions , where the barrier is fabricated using the nb native oxides . in this case , different nb@xmath2o@xmath4 oxides are present in the barrier .",
    "this fact usually prevents the analysis of the dv / di characteristics in terms of perfect tunnelling .",
    "indeed , we show below that our junctions are neither in the tunnelling nor in the transparent regime , but rather in a regime intermediate between both .",
    "we shall argue that the current polarization can be obtained even in this intermediate regime by use of a simple model .",
    "nb(110 ) and ni(111 ) films , grown by dc magnetron sputtering , were used as electrodes . the structural characterization of these films",
    "was done by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , see for instance villegas _",
    "et al_.@xcite briefly , the junction fabrication was as follows : first , a nb thin film of 100 nm thickness was evaporated on a si substrate at room temperature .",
    "an ar pressure of 1 mtorr was kept during the deposition . under these conditions ,",
    "the roughness of the nb film , extracted from xrd and afm , is less than 0.3 nm@xcite and superconducting critical temperatures of 8.6 k are obtained .",
    "after this , the film was chemically etched to make a strip of 1 mm width .",
    "a tunnel barrier was prepared by oxidizing this nb electrode in a saturated water vapor atmosphere at room temperature.@xcite the thickness of the oxide layer , extracted from the simulations performed with the suprex program,@xcite is 2.5 nm .",
    "x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis performed in these oxidized films reveals that dielectric nb@xmath5o@xmath6 is the main oxide formed .",
    "there are also other oxides , such as metallic nbo , but in much less amount .",
    "taken into account grundner and halbritter studies,@xcite nb@xmath5o@xmath6 is the outermost oxide layer on nb , whereas nbo is located closer to the nb film .",
    "the characterization by afm reveals a rms roughness of around 0.7 nm",
    ". a detailed account of the structural and compositional characterization of the barrier has been reported elsewhere.@xcite    on top of this film ( nb with the oxide barrier ) , the second electrode of ni was deposited under the same conditions as nb ( up to 60 nm thickness ) using a mask to produce cross strips of 0.5 mm width , so that the overlap area @xmath7 of the two electrodes is 0.5 mm@xmath8 .",
    "junctions fabricated using these materials and geometry , will not show a good tunneling behaviour , neither a point - contact behaviour . as we will see , the junctions will lie on the intermediate regime .",
    "perpendicular transport in tunnelling configuration was investigated by means of characteristic dynamic resistance ( @xmath9 ) versus voltage ( @xmath10 ) using a conventional bridge with the four - probe method and lock - in techniques .",
    "the measured lock - in output voltage was calibrated in terms of resistance by using a known standard resistor .",
    "we have measured the conductance , defined as the inverse of the differential resistance @xmath9 , of three different tunnel junctions .",
    "moreover , junction 1 ( j1 ) has been measured and analyzed at temperature @xmath11 k , junction 2 ( j2 ) , at temperatures @xmath12 and @xmath13 k , and junction 3 ( j3 ) , at temperatures @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 k. these measurements have allowed us to access and assess the behavioiur and quality of our samples in the low ( j1 and j2 ) and intermediate ( j2 and j3 ) temperature range of this heterojunction .",
    "each data set presented in this article has been normalized with respect to the background conductance @xmath17 of the corresponding junction .",
    "the conductance @xmath18 across a normal / superconducting junction may be expressed in terms of the reflection probabilities @xmath19 of quasiparticles transversing the junction , and of andreev processes @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fermi function ; and @xmath10 is the applied voltage .",
    "andreev reflection processes are proportional to the square of the conventional transmission coefficient of the barrier , @xmath23 , and therefore are strongly suppressed for highly resistive barriers .",
    "junctions with transmission coefficients smaller than about 0.1 show small subgap conductances , and can be classified as belonging to the tunneling regime .",
    "our experimental results , shown as black circles in  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , exhibit a significant conductance below the superconducting gap even at the lowest temperatures . therefore we expect that our effective oxide barriers should be neither too high nor too thick , and we classify them as belonging to an intermediate transparency regime .",
    "while there are fairly complete descriptions of the transmission across ferromagnet / superconducting junctions@xcite , we have decided to describe it by three models that share the virtue that are conceptual and algebraically simple .",
    "these models are : i ) the generalization of the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model @xcite to ferromagnetic electrodes proposed by strijkers and coworkers;@xcite ii ) a description of the effects of a finite current polarization in terms of spin dependent transmission coefficients , as discussed by prez - willard _",
    "et al_;@xcite and iii ) a very simple generalization of the btk model to ferromagnetic electrodes with finite bulk magnetization .",
    "we define the current polarization @xmath24 as the imbalance between the current intensity of majority and minority carriers@xcite in a metal / ferromagnet junction , measured when the voltage tends to zero ,    @xmath25    where both spin channels contribute equally to the total current intensity and conductance .",
    "k. black circles indicate experimental data ; dashed - dotted green lines are fits to model i , dashed blue , fits to model ii , and solid red , fits to model iii.,width=302,height=264 ]    [ fig1 ]      strijkers model uses as adjustable parameters the current polarization @xmath24 , the height of barrier @xmath26,@xcite which is modeled by a delta function , and the size of the superconducting gap at the interface @xmath27 .",
    "the process of electron transfer across the junction is splitted into a fully polarized channel , for which the andreev reflection coefficient @xmath28 is zero , and @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the coherence coefficients of the superconducting wave function ; and a paramagnetic channel described by the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the btk model in its conventional form.@xcite    the total conductance is then written in terms of the conductance of the fully polarized channel ( @xmath34 ) and the conductance of the paramagnetic channel ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 this model interpolates between the paramagnetic case ( btk model ) , and the half metal , where it predicts correctly that the amplitude for andreev reflection vanishes .",
    "k ( a ) and 3.945 k ( b ) , together with a fit to models i ( dash - dotted green ) , ii ( dashed blue ) and iii ( solid red).,width=302,height=264 ]    [ fig2 ]      we now use a simple model based on quasiclassical theory,@xcite in which boundary conditions have been dumped into the spin - dependent transmission coefficients @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the conductance for each spin channel in this model is determined by @xmath38 where the effective reflection coefficients depend now on spin .",
    "these can be expressed in terms of the normal @xmath39 and anomalous @xmath40 components of the green s function , evaluated right at the superconducting side of the interface , as follows @xmath41 where the reflection amplitude of the barrier satisfies the sum rule @xmath42 .",
    "the explicit functional form of @xmath43 and @xmath44 may be obtained from the equation of motion of the quasiclassical green function that , for a bulk superconductor , reduces to @xmath45 where disorder and pair breaking effects , parametrized by the dynes parameter @xmath46,@xcite are dealt within the t - matrix approximation .",
    "( 5 ) is used to fit the conductance data , using the two transmissions @xmath37 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 as adjustable parameters .",
    "4.53 k ( a ) , 5.0 k ( b ) and 5.39 k ( c ) , together with a fit to models ii ( dashed blue ) and iii ( solid red).,width=302,height=264 ]    [ fig3 ]    eqs .",
    "( 7 ) can also be solved when the gap @xmath48 is zero .",
    "this gives @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and corresponds the solution for the normal state .",
    "then , the conductance per spin chanel is , simply , @xmath51 , and the current polarization is obtained from it as @xmath52    perez - willard et al.@xcite used this model to analyze al / co point contacts , where the proximity effect may be discarded since the size of the junction is negligible compared with the coherence length .",
    "they indeed found close agreement with their experimental data for a wide range of temperatures .",
    ".parameters used to fit junctions 1 , 2 , and 3 with model ii . here",
    "@xmath53 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is also apparent from the table that model ii provides values for the superconducting gap that are too small , and actually do not seem to follow the temperature dependence expected for a bcs superconductor .",
    "for instance , the model predicts a zero - temperature gap for j3 , @xmath54 mev . using the measured critical temperature , we find that the ratio @xmath55 is equal to 3.25 , which is much smaller than that of bulk nb ( 3.8 ) .    to understand better why the model fails to fit the zero voltage conductance of j2 and j3 , we plot in fig .",
    "4 @xmath56 for several sets of the parameters",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath24 and @xmath47 , that cover most of the parameter space .",
    "we have chosen for @xmath57 the values 0.1 , 0.4 , 0.55 and 0.7 .",
    "for each @xmath57 , we have taken two representative values of @xmath58 ( 0.15 and 0.35 ) and three different values of @xmath47 , ( 0.1 , 0.3 and 0.5 ) .",
    "the figure shows that the 24 curves cluster in four different sets , according to the value of @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that the value and temperature dependence of the zero - voltage conductance is determined in this model essentially by the average transmision .",
    "the figure demonstrates in any case that the experimental values of @xmath59 for junctions j2 and j3 show a stronger dependence with temperature than the estimates provided by model 2 .",
    "we therefore believe that the model , while very appealing due to its simplicity , is actually too simple to describe the physical behavior of these junctions that belong to the intermediate transparency regime and have been measured at low and intermediate temperatures .     as a function of reduced temperature .",
    "red circles and black squares correspond to the experimentals data of j2 and j3 , respectively . dashed red and solid black lines correspond to the values of @xmath59 obtained with model iii , using the parameters shown in table ii.,width=302,height=226 ]    we turn the attention now to our generalized btk model ( model iii ) .",
    "we note that the model is able to fit well the conductance data of junctions 1 and 2 .",
    "in addition , it also provides a good fit to the data of j3 , in contrast to the quasiclassical model .",
    "more importantly , the model provides a temperature - independent barrier height @xmath26 , that translates into temperature - independent transmission coefficients ( see table ii ) .",
    "the values of z so obtained allow us to clasify the junctions in an intermediate regime between tunnelling and point contact .",
    "junction 2 is actually the closest to the tunneling regime , while junction 1 is closest to the transparent regime .",
    "junction 3 , that we failed to fit with model ii , lies well within this intermediate regime .",
    "5 clearly demonstrates that our model provides a temperature dependence of @xmath59 that fits well the experimental data .",
    "( a ) shows the temperature dependence of the gap @xmath48 obtained in the fits performed with model iii .",
    "we find values for the gap slightly smaller than those of bulk nb , but consistent with the measured critical temperature and with the conventional temperature dependence of a bcs superconductor .",
    "the extrapolated zero - temperature gap , @xmath60 mev , provides a superconducting ratio @xmath61 in close agreement with the ratio for nb , 3.8 .",
    "( a ) also shows the temperature dependence of the disorder parameter .",
    "we find that @xmath47 shows a smooth and linear dependence within the studied range of temperatures .",
    "the values of @xmath47 are large , as should be expected , since our nb samples are highly disordered .",
    "we plot in fig",
    ". 6 ( b ) the current polarization @xmath24 obtained using model iii , as a function of the height of the barrier z. we find that @xmath24 increases with z from 0.13 to 0.19 , which shows that the current polarization increases with the tunelling quality of the junction .",
    "we note that soulen et al .",
    "@xcite have found polarizations of about 45% using ni / nb junctions in a point contact geometry .",
    "more recently kim and moodera  @xcite have performed experiments for ni / al plannar tunnel junctions .",
    "they have found that @xmath24 grows from 11% to 33% as the tunneling quality of the junctions increases .",
    "our theoretical calculations confirm that @xmath24 should increase with the strength or the thickness of the tunneling barrier .",
    "the preceding analysis shows that the main advantage of model iii ( btk ) over model ii ( adjustable spin dependent transmission coefficients ) is the stronger dependence on temperature of the conductance in model iii .",
    "the main difference between the two models lies in the description of the ferromagnetic electrode .",
    "model iii uses two different fermi surfaces , one for each spin .",
    "hence , the proximity effect is suppressed , reducing the andreev reflection at low temperatures .     of the delta - function barrier entering our generalized btk model for the three junctions studied in this article .",
    "lines have been added to aid the eye.,width=302,height=226 ]",
    "we have fabricated and measured fairly large and far from ideal superconducting / ferromegnetic tunel junctions .",
    "a simple theoretical model allows us to extract tunnelling related parameters for such junctions .",
    "we have grown nb / nb@xmath0o@xmath1/ni planar tunnel junctions , and measured its conductance at different temperatures .",
    "we have found that they belong to the regime of intermediate transparencies .",
    "we have been able to fit the conductance curves with a simple generalization of the btk model,@xcite that provides a sensible set of temperature - independent transmission probabilities .",
    "our calculations suggest that the results can depend significantly on the description of the bulk ferromagnetic electrode , as andreev reflection depends both on the barrier transmission coefficients and on the exchange field inside the ferromagnet .",
    "we have been able to give reasonable values of the current polarization without the need to apply a magnetic field .",
    "we have also studied the relationship between these two quantities , showing that the current polarization depends significantly on the height of the barrier .",
    "this simple generalization of the btk model to a superconducting / ferromagnetic junction could be improved considering a 3d model .",
    "however , we have shown that the simple one dimensional model can fit the experimental data and also provides good estimates of the current polarization .",
