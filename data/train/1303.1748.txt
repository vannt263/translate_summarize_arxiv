    "the question about how to define the notion of _ mean value _ over a set of structured samples has no intrinsic answer . even in the simple case of a data set made of two positive real - valued numbers ,",
    "there exist a variety of methods to define their mean value , each of which possesses different properties and leads to a different numerical result .",
    "the best known averages of two numbers @xmath0 are the arithmetic mean @xmath1 , the harmonic mean @xmath2 and the geometric mean @xmath3 .",
    "a generalization of these is the heinz mean @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , that interpolates between the arithmetic ( @xmath6 ) and the geometric ( @xmath7 ) mean .",
    "another averaging formula is given by the heronian mean @xmath8 , that corresponds to a weighted sum of the arithmetic and the geometric means of the positive numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "most averaging formulas lead to instances of the _ chisini mean _ as defined in @xcite .",
    "the chisini mean provides a good illustration of the fact that it is possible to define a mean value of a set of numbers without any particular requirement about , e.g. , convexity .",
    "a function @xmath11 of @xmath12 real - valued variables leads to a chisini mean value @xmath13 if , for every tuple @xmath14 , there exists a unique @xmath13 such that @xmath15 the definition of chisini mean is really general and there were discussions whether it could be taken as a valid definition of mean ( for a discussion , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . but note that , for example , the arithmetic mean @xmath16 of a tuple @xmath14 is a chisini mean with @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , with this choice of the function @xmath11 , the equation ( [ chimean ] ) reads : @xmath18 a rather general definition of mean value of a set of real - valued numbers led to the _ kolmogoroff - nagumo _ ( or _ quasi - arithmetic _ )",
    "mean @xmath19 for a continuous strictly monotonic function @xmath20 ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in the case of structured samples , such as structured matrices , the question about how to extend the definition of kolmogoroff - nagumo mean is rather involved .",
    "the kolmogoroff - nagumo mean turns out to be a special case of the chisini mean .",
    "in fact , upon defining @xmath21 , it is readily verified that the mean @xmath22 is the unique solution to the chisini equation ( [ chimean ] ) @xmath23 structured matrices appear in a variety of settings such as matrix - based optimization problems @xcite , medical imaging @xcite , statistical analysis on manifolds @xcite , adaptive filtering @xcite , computational ophthalmology @xcite and radio polarimetry @xcite . the empirical mean is perhaps the most useful statistical characterization of a set of structured matrices @xcite , along with the empirical variance .",
    "when the matrices to average obey internal constraints such as orthogonality , the result of simple summation and division by the number of summands , which would represent an arithmetic mean , does not obey the same constraints , in general .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain an empirical arithmetic mean of orthogonal matrices , it is necessary to establish a calculation method by considering the geometric structure of the matrix - space that the matrices to average belong to .    to solve this problem , kaneko , tanaka and fiori",
    "@xcite constructed an averaging algorithm on the compact stiefel manifold which is a non - trivial extension of averaging algorithms on lie - group - type manifolds presented in @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea behind the algorithms developed in the contributions @xcite is that the sample - points on the stiefel manifold are mapped onto a tangent space , where the average is taken , and then the obtained average point on the tangent space is brought back to the stiefel manifold , via appropriate maps which are referred to as a _ retraction map _ and a _ lifting map_. a variety of algorithms on the compact stiefel manifold utilizing such maps were explained in @xcite , whose convergence features and computational runtime were compared and which were applied to averaging real - world samples .",
    "the key point is that , in order to construct an averaging algorithm on the compact stiefel manifold , it is necessary to construct an appropriate retraction / lifting pair .",
    "the averaging algorithms proposed in @xcite utilize qr - decomposition - based , cayley - transform - based , polar - decomposition - based and orthographic - type retraction / lifting pairs .",
    "all these algorithms , however , suffer of a bloating of computational demand with the increase of the size of the processed matrices .",
    "for example , in the case of the polar - decomposition - based retraction / lifting pair , the retraction map may be expressed in closed form , while the computation of the associated lifting map requires solving a continuous - time algebraic riccati equation .    in the present paper , in order to ease the computational demand of the previously - introduced class of averaging algorithms , a new kolmogoroff - nagumo - type averaging algorithm is proposed which exploits a combination of a closed form polar retraction map and a closed form orthographic lifting map .",
    "the implication of the proposed choice are evaluated analytically as well as numerically .",
    "the aim of the present section is to build - up an averaging algorithm on the compact stiefel manifold based on the notion of _ mixed manifold retraction / lifting pair_. the algorithm , stemming from a non - linear matrix - type equation , is implemented by a fast fixed - point iteration scheme .",
    "the compact stiefel manifold @xcite is defined by : @xmath24 where symbol @xmath25 denotes a @xmath26 identity matrix and @xmath27 , namely , the manifold @xmath28 is the space of the ` tall - skinny ' orthogonal matrices .",
    "its tangent space at a point @xmath29 may be expressed as : @xmath30 each tangent space is a vector space under standard matrix addition and multiplication by a real scalar .",
    "the following measure of discrepancy @xmath31 : st@xmath32 st@xmath33 between two stiefel - manifold matrices is made use of : @xmath34 where symbol @xmath35 denotes the frobenius norm .    a _ retraction _ at a point @xmath29 of a stiefel manifold is defined as a map @xmath36 ( for a complete definition see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while a map @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , for @xmath39 , is termed _ lifting _ map ( for a complete definition see , e.g. , @xcite ) . both maps are defined only locally , therefore , hereafter it is assumed that @xmath40 and @xmath41 lay sufficiently close to each other to evaluate @xmath42 and that @xmath43 is sufficiently close to @xmath44 to evaluate @xmath45 .",
    "given a point @xmath29 and a vector @xmath46 , the _ polar - decomposition retraction _ on the stiefel manifold may be written in closed form @xcite : @xmath47 the associated _ polar - decomposition lifting _ is denoted by @xmath48 .    the _ orthographic lifting map _",
    "@xcite may be defined as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes a projection from the ambient space @xmath52 into a tangent space @xmath53 . according to @xcite ,",
    "one such a projector is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "plugging equation ( [ eq2 ] ) into equation ( [ eq1 ] ) gives : @xmath57 the associated _ orthographic retraction map _ is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "the following steps lead to an equation characterizing the unknown empirical mean matrix @xmath29 , which represents an estimate of the actual center of mass @xmath59 on the basis of the available information :    1 .",
    "map the points @xmath60 belonging to a neighborhood of the sought - for mean - matrix @xmath29 onto @xmath61 by applying the lifting map @xmath62 .",
    "denote such points as @xmath63 .",
    "2 .   compute the linear combination @xmath64 .",
    "3 .   bring back the mean vector @xmath65 to @xmath28 by the retraction @xmath66 and get an empirical mean matrix @xmath67 .    summarizing the above procedure ,",
    "a mean matrix @xmath29 is the solution of the non - linear , matrix - type equation : @xmath68 in the variable @xmath40 .",
    "the analogy between the quasi - arithmetic mean for real numbers ( [ knm ] ) and the equation ( [ eq : mean ] ) is apparent , except that the equation ( [ eq : mean ] ) is an implicit function of the mean ( as both sides of the equation depend on the mean value ) instead of being an explicit function as in the case of kolmogoroff - nagumo mean .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : mean ] ) is solved numerically by means of a fixed - point iteration algorithm , that generates a sequence @xmath69 of estimates of the sought - for empirical mean matrix @xmath40 , and that may be written as : @xmath70 where matrix @xmath71 denotes an initial guess . in the previous contributions @xcite , the algorithm ( [ eq : mean_fp ] ) was based on associated retraction / lifting pairs , namely , either @xmath72 or @xmath73 , while , in the present paper , the mixed retraction / lifting pair @xmath74 is made use of with the aim to decrease the computational burden of the algorithm .",
    "although , by definition of retraction / lifting pair , it holds @xmath75 , it is recognized that the composition @xmath76 does not equal the identity map in @xmath77 . in other terms , given matrices @xmath78 , the discrepancy @xmath79 differs from zero , in general .",
    "such a discrepancy may be evaluated as follows .",
    "first , note that : @xmath80 define @xmath81 and set @xmath82 .",
    "it holds that : @xmath83 hence , the discrepancy ( [ discr ] ) takes on the expression : @xmath84\\right.\\times\\\\        & & \\left.\\left[2i_n-\\frac{1}{4}(m - m^t)^2-mm^t\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\|_{\\mathrm{f}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that when @xmath85 then @xmath86 and the above expression gives @xmath87 .",
    "the iteration rule ( [ eq : mean_fp ] ) generalizes the averaging methods proposed independently in @xcite .",
    "the fixed - point solution @xmath40 of the iteration ( [ eq : mean_fp ] ) satisfies the equation : @xmath88 namely , the fixed point @xmath40 is a zero of the vector field @xmath89 .",
    "the proposition 2.3 proved in @xcite holds and ensures that , if the samples @xmath90 are not too spread ( see @xcite for a precise definition ) , the zero of the vector field @xmath91 is unique , hence , the iteration rule ( [ eq : mean_fp ] ) is locally well - defined and leads to a unique average .",
    "the fixed - point - type iteration rule ( [ eq : mean_fp ] ) also generalizes the averaging methods based on the minimization of a spread function based on the riemannian distance .",
    "a complete study of the convergence properties of such methods , based on a gradient - descent - type optimization procedure , is available in @xcite .",
    "an earlier study of an averaging method based on a newton - type optimization procedure was proposed in @xcite .    the iteration rule ( [ eq : mean_fp ] )",
    "could be further generalized by introducing an unequal weighting scheme of the tangent - vectors @xmath92 as suggested in the contribution @xcite ( see algorithm 2 ) .",
    "such weighting scheme would lead to an iteration rule of the type : @xmath93 where weights @xmath94 depend on the mutual distance from the samples and the current value of the iteration @xmath95 .",
    "in the present section , the results of different experiments are illustrated to get an insight into the numerical behavior of the discussed retraction / lifting map pairs in the context of averaging over the compact stiefel manifold . in the numerical experiments ,",
    "the center @xmath96 of the distribution of the samples @xmath90 is generated by computing the q - factor of a thin - qr decomposition of a matrix randomly generated in @xmath97 with normally - distributed entries .",
    "the @xmath12 samples to average are generated by the rule @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a matrix randomly generated in @xmath101 with normally - distributed entries , and @xmath102 controls the spread of the distribution @xcite .",
    "the initial guess @xmath103 in the fixed - point iteration algorithm ( [ eq : mean_fp ] ) was chosen by slightly rotating the sample @xmath104 via a quasi - unit random rotation .",
    "the numerical tests were performed by running a matlab^^ 7 ( 64 bit ) code on platform featuring an intel^^ xeon^^ ( 2.93 ghz ) with 8 cores and 12 gb ram .",
    "the first experiment aims at evaluating the numerical behavior of the compound map @xmath76 .",

    "the discrepancy values @xmath105 distribute approximately around @xmath110 , confirming that the composition @xmath76 , although not being an identity map , numerically behaves similarly to an identity map in the considered range .",
