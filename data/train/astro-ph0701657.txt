    "how to measure the black hole ( bh ) masses of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is an intriguing research subject .",
    "the masses of the central black hole in nearby galaxies can be estimated by kinematic studies of nuclear gas disks ( @xcite , tsvetanov et al .",
    "1998 , ford et al .",
    "1994 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ) or dynamical studies of stars in galactic centers ( gebhardt & richstone 2000 , bower et al .",
    "2000 ) , using high spatial resolution data ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , because of higher luminosity and larger distance , these two methods are noneffictive for agn .",
    "thus , there are many efforts to find effective ways to estimate the masses of central black hole of agn .",
    "the most successful and convenient way is under the assumption of virialization , @xmath3 .",
    "the size of broad emission line regions ( blrs , @xmath4 ) can be estimated through the empirical relation between continuum luminosity and the size of blrs ( kaspi et al . 2000 , 2005 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 , wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) , according to the results of reverberation mapping technique ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use the term size of blrs as equivalent of distance of the blrs to the central source .",
    "the velocity @xmath5 can be estimated by the line width of broad low - ionization emission lines coming from blrs , assuming motions of the blrs clouds are gravitationally dominated by the central mass of the host galaxy ( gaskell 1988 , wandel et al .",
    "1999 , peterson & wandel 1999 , gaskell 1996 ) . using these methods , bh masses have been determined for a large number of agn . from bh masses , other fundamental parameters of agn , such as the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath6 , can be estimated .",
    "thus , the nature of agn can be understood better .",
    "the empirical relation between @xmath4 and continuum luminosity @xmath7 has been studied for several years , since it was found by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and wandel et al .",
    "more and more evidence indicates that the assumption of virialization combined with the empirical relation of @xmath2 is a better method to estimate the bh masses of agn ( ovcharov et al .",
    "2005 , wu et al .",
    "2004 , mclure & jarvis 2004 , 2002 , marziani et al .",
    "2003 ) , although there are few inconsistentcies of the reverberation mapping technique ( maoz 1996 ) .",
    "recently , the method was used to estimate the bh masses for high redshift agn ( dietrich & hamann 2004 ; brotherton & scoggins 2004 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .",
    "however , there is an answered question : can the empirical relation between @xmath4 and continuum luminosity @xmath7 can be applied to any type of agn .",
    "wang & zhang ( 2003 ) have found that the size of blrs of dwarf active galaxies ( luminosity of h@xmath8 less than @xmath9 , ho et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b , maoz 1999 ) is not consistent with the value from the empirical relation @xmath10 ( new results about dwarf agn can be found in zhang , dultzin - hacyan & wang 2007a ) .",
    "perhaps , we need more tests to verify whether the empirical relation can be applied to some special types of agn , for which the sizes of blrs can be estimated by other methods .    there is a special kind of agn with double - peaked broad low - ionization emission lines ( hereafter , dbp emitters ) originated from the accretion disk near the central black hole .",
    "the most famous dbp emitters are ngc 1097 ( storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 , 1997 , 2003 ) , arp102b ( chen et al .",
    "1989 , 1997 , chen & halpern 1989 , halpern et al .",
    "1996 , antonucci et al .",
    "1996 , sulentic et al . 1990 ) and 3c390.3 ( shapovalova et al . 2001 , gilbert et al . 1999 ) etc .. a successful model for dbp emitters is the accretion disk model ( circular disk model : chen et al .",
    "1989 , chen & halpern 1989 , elliptical disk model : eracleous et al .",
    "1995 , warped disk model : bachev 1999 , hartnoll & blackman 2000 , circular disk with spiral arm model : hartnoll & blackman 2002 , karas et al .",
    "there are now two samples of dbp emitters , one includes 23 objects which are nearly all liners selected from radio galaxies ( eracleous & halpern 1994 , 2003 , eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ) , the other sample includes 112 objects , of which 12% are classfied as liners ( strateva et al . 2003 ) selected from sdss dr2 ( york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the statistical results indicate that the continuum luminosity of dbp emitters is not much different from the other agn , the medium luminosity is @xmath11 . however , the line width is six times broader than that of normal agn . thus , if the bh masses of dbp emitters are estimated under the assumption of virialization and using the empirical relation between the size of blrs and continuum luminosity , the bh masses would be about tens of times larger than those of normal agn .",
    "fortunately , when fitting the line profiles of double - peaked broad emission lines of dbp emitters , the size of the region which produces the double - peaked broad emission lines can be estimated in units of @xmath12 .",
    "this provides a better way to verify whether the size of blrs of dbp emitters from the empirical relation @xmath13 is the same as that from the accretion disk model , once the bh masses of dbp emitters are known .",
    "section 2 presents the data sample .",
    "the results are shown in section 3 , and then in section 4 we present the discussions and conclusions .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 have been adopted here .",
    "we selected dbp emitters from the literature according to the following criteria .",
    "first , there is stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge or bh masses determined by kinematic / dynamical studies for the object , or there are other parameters , such as the accurate line width of narrow emission lines , which can trace the stellar velocity dispersion of bulge .",
    "second , there are physical parameters of the accretion disk model for the double - peaked broad balmer emission lines .",
    "we selected 12 dbp emitters listed in table 1 .",
    "there are four objects of which the spectra can be found in sdss database : b2 0742 + 31 , cso 0643 , cbs 74 and 3c303 . in sdss",
    ", they are sdss j074541.67 + 314256.7 , sdss j142314.19 + 505537.4 , sdss j083225.34 + 370736.2 and sdss j144302.76 + 520137.2 .",
    "thus , the line width of narrow emission lines can be measured accurately from sdss spectra . in table 1",
    ", the first column gives the name of the object , the second column gives the stellar velocity dispersion in units of @xmath17 , the third column gives the logarithmic bh masses in units of @xmath18 from the empirical relation @xmath19 , the forth column gives the size of blrs in units of light - days from accretion disk model , the fifth column gives the continuum luminosity at 5100@xmath20 in units of @xmath21 , the sixth column gives the line width of broad emission lines in units of @xmath17 , the seventh column gives the size of blrs in units of light - days from the empirical relation @xmath13 , the eighth column is the logarithmic virial bh masses in units of @xmath22 estimated under the assumption of virialization , the ninth column presents the power law index of the line emissivity for each object according to accretion disk model , the last column lists the references .",
    "the most accurate way to estimate central bh masses is by kinematic or dynamics analysis . using the results of some tens of nearby galaxies , a strongly tight relation between stellar velocity dispersion @xmath23 and bh masses",
    "@xmath24 has been found ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 , ferrarese & merritt 2001 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ) : @xmath25 which indicates a tight relation between the evolution of bulge and that of the central black hole in galaxies , which is further confirmed by the tight relation between central bh masses and the masses of bulge of the host galaxy(hring & rix 2004 , marconi & hunt 2003 , mclure & dunlop 2002 , laor 2001 , kormendy 2001 , wandel 1999 ) . whether the relation @xmath26 can be applied for higher redshift , higher luminousity agn or other types of agn has been studied by treu et al .",

    "( 2004 ) , treves et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , falomo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , wang & lu ( 2001 ) among others .",
    "these studies reach a similar conclusion that the empirical relation @xmath27 holds for all agn .",
    "thus , we first estimate the central bh masses using this relation .",
    "there are eight dbp emitters with stellar velocity dispersions measured from absorption properties .",
    "the other four dbp emitters are classified as qsos in sdss .",
    "it is difficult to measure the stellar velocity dispersion for qsos .",
    "there are some other ways to estimate the central bh masses by physical parameters of bulge of the host galaxy , such as using the magnitude of the bulge ( mclure & dunlop 2001 , 2002 ) , using the line width of narrow emission lines ( borson 2003 , greene & ho 2005a ) . here",
    ", we measure the line width of the core of [ oiii ] doublet to trace the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge .",
    "there can be also a broad gaussian function for the extended asymmetric components of the [ oiii ] emission lines as described in greene & ho ( 2005a ) .",
    "the correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and line width of narrow emission lines has been studied by greene & ho ( 2005a ) for a large sample of agn selected from sdss . for radio",
    "loud agn , the line width of [ oiii]@xmath28 is broader than that of other narrow emission lines , however the line width of the core of [ oiii]@xmath28 can trace stellar velocity dispersion . further , the line width of the core of [ oiii]@xmath28 of the four objects in our sample is the same as that of the other narrow emission lines within the errors .",
    "here we assume the uncertainty of the line width to trace the stellar velocity dispersion is about 40 percent ( the value for high radio agn in greene & ho 2005a ) .",
    "once we obtain the central bh masses , the sizes of blrs , @xmath29 , from accretion disk model can be translated from units of @xmath30 to units of light - days in order to compare with the values , @xmath31 , from the empirical relation @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , in order to compare the central bh masses estimated by different methods , the virial bh masses @xmath33 estimated under the assumption of virialization are also shown in table 1 :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the line width of broad h@xmath0 , @xmath36 is a scale factor which depends on the structure of blrs . here",
    ", we use the up - to - date empirical relation @xmath13 selected from kaspi et al .",
    "however , we notice that there are several dbp emitters for which the continuum luminosities are less than @xmath37 , which is out of the range of continuum luminosity of the sample of kaspi et al .",
    "however , we have found that for low luminous agn , the size of blrs is somewhat larger than the predicted value from the empirical relation equation 2.a ( wang & zhang 2003 ; zhang , dultzin - hacyan & wang 2007a ) .",
    "thus , the bh masses estimated from the above equations for objects with lower continuum luminosity are smaller than the expected virial bh masses .    moreover , collin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) demonstrate that the scale factor @xmath38 depends on the line width of the broad emission lines , and this factor is much different from objects in population a and population b ( sulentic , marziani & dultzin - hacyan 2000 ) and the inclination effects play a role in some cases .",
    "we can not get an accurate spectra for all the dbp emitters to determine the factor of @xmath38 . here",
    ", we use the mean facotr @xmath39 for the second moment of broad emission lines rather than the value of fwhm ( onken et al .",
    "2004 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , @xmath40 .",
    "we do not have enough information to get the mean / rms line spectra to determine the relation between fwhm(h@xmath41 ) and the second moment @xmath42 , we commonly select the mean value of 1.87 , @xmath43 , of the famous dbp emitter 3c390.3 ( the line widths and second moment of the emission lines can be found in peterson et al .",
    "last , we accept @xmath44 in equation 2b . also , the values of @xmath31 from equation 2.a are shown in table 1 . moreover , the continuum luminosity is the value after the subtraction of contributions of star light according to the starlight fraction in eracelous & halpern ( 1994 , 2003 ) .",
    "for the two dbp emitters , ngc 1097 and ngc 4450 , not included in the paper of eracleous & halpern ( 1994 , 2003 ) , the continuum luminosities of the nucleus are estimated according to the absolute b magnitude of the featureless continuum of the nucleus from the paper of ho et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "which parameters of double - peaked emission lines , fwhm , the second moment of the lines or other parameters , can be used to trace more accurately the velocity dispersion of blrs is an open question . however , the main objective of this paper is to inspect whether the virial bh masses estimated by the line parameter fwhm are reliable .",
    "thus the parameter , fwhm , is also selected from the paper of strateva et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and eracleous & halpern ( 1994 , 2003 ) measured according to the definition of fwhm : the full width at half maximum .",
    "another problem is the inclination angle of the accretion disk . from the accretion disk model",
    ", we can accept the inclination angle of accretion disk @xmath45 , thus , the local value of fwhm in the accretion disk can be similarly estimated by @xmath46 , which is several times larger than the observed value of fwhm .",
    "however , the scale factor @xmath36 in equation 2.b is a factor to correct the effects of inclination angle to some extent . assuming a simple disk structure of blrs , the scale factor we used represents a mean inclination angle @xmath47 ( onken et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the inclination angles of dbp emitters in our sample are always in the range from @xmath48 ( eracleous & halpern 1994 , 2003 ) , thus the inclination angle has little effects on the results about bh masses .",
    "figure 1 shows the correlation between two kinds of bh masses : @xmath24 and @xmath33 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation analysis gives the rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath49 ) of -0.23 and the significance level of its deviation from zero of @xmath50 for all 12 dbp emitters .",
    "the kendalls correlation analysis presents the same results : correlation coefficient is -0.15 with @xmath51 .",
    "this result indicates that there is no significant correlation between the central bh masses estimated by means of the two different methods for dbp emitters .",
    "the mean value of the bh masses ratio of @xmath33 to @xmath24 is no less than @xmath52 , because the virial bh masses for two dbp emitters , ngc 1097 and ngc4050 are smaller ones .",
    "if we consider only the six objects with measured stellar velocity dispersions of the bulge and with continuum luminosity larger than @xmath37 , the spearman and kendalls rank correlation coefficients are 0.48 with @xmath53 and 0.33 with @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic analysis indicates that there are about 32% probability that the two kinds of bh masses having the same distribution .",
    "the ratio of @xmath33 to @xmath24 for the six objects is @xmath55 .",
    "now , the sizes of blrs of dbp emitters can be calculated from two different methods : from the accretion disk model , @xmath29 , and from the empirical relation according to the continuum luminosity , @xmath31 . here",
    ", the range of the size from accretion disk model is larger , so the flux - weighted mean radius is used as the mean size of blrs ( here , we can not consider the effects of eccentricity of elliptical accretion disk model ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the line emissivity , the value of @xmath58 for each dbp emitter is listed in table 1 according to the accretion disk model . here , we just calculate the flux - weighted mean size by only even ten points between the inner radius and outer radius . because of the steep power law of line emissivity , it is a better choice to select the points in logarithmic space of the radius .",
    "the last results are listed in table 1 . for object",
    "ngc 1097 , we select the mean value of @xmath59 ( inner the radius , the power - law index is @xmath60 and outer the radius @xmath61 ) as the mean size of blrs according to the fitted results for spectra observed during ten years ( storchi - bergmann , nemmen , et al .",
    "2003 ; storchi - bergmann , eracleous et al . 1997 ; storchi - bergmann , eracleous & halpern 1995 ; storchi - bergmann , baldwin et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath29 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the spearman and kendalls rank correlation coefficients are -0.31 with @xmath62 and -0.24 with @xmath63 resepectively for all 12 dbp emitters . if we just consider the six dbp emitters with accurate stellar velocity dispersions and with continuum luminosities larger than @xmath37 , the spearman and kendalls rank correlation coefficients are 0.37 with @xmath50 and 0.21 with @xmath64 resepectively .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the size of blrs according to the accretion disk model for 3c 390.3 is about 14.26 light - days as the same as the result @xmath65 from reverberation mapping technique within the errors ( peterson et al . , 2004 )",
    ". the mean ratio of @xmath31 to @xmath29 is about @xmath66 for all 12 dbp emitters and @xmath67 for the six dbp emitters with stellar veocity dispersions and with continuum luminosity larger than @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic analysis indicates that there are about 31% probability that the two kinds of the size of blrs have the same distribution .    from the results about bh masses and size of blrs , the basic results are that the virial bh masses of dbp emitters are systematically larger than the bh masses estimated from the stellar velocity dispersions and the sizes of blrs calculated from continuum luminosity are also systematically larger than the true sizes of blrs from the accretion disk model . however ,",
    "if only considering the six objects with stellar velocity dispersions and higher continuum luminosities , the results indicate that there are some moderate correlations between the two kinds of bh masses and the two kinds of the sizes of blrs .",
    "there are many references in the literature which discuss the consistency between the two kinds of bh masses according to the physical parameters of blrs and according to the physical parameters of the bulge of the host galaxy , especially for low redshift and low luminosity agn .",
    "it is not clear if the empirical relations ( equation 2a and equation 2b ) hold for agn at @xmath68 or if the bh - bulge relation holds for agn with higher redshift ( sultntic et al .",
    "2006 ) . for dbp emitters",
    ", the double - peaked low - ionization emission lines can be best fitted by accretion disk model ( eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ) , the local velocity in the accretion disk can be estimated by kepler s law , even considering the gravitational effects , especially when the radius is not nearer to the central black hole .",
    "thus , the assumption of virialization can be expected to hold for dbp emitters .",
    "however , we find that the mean virial bh masses are larger than bh masses from stellar velocity dispersion for dbp emitters . although , we used the observed fwhm of broad emission lines , the scale factor @xmath36 has considered the effects of inclination angle .",
    "thus , the main reason of the difference of two kinds of bh masses is due to the larger size of blrs derived from empirical relation @xmath69 .",
    "from the results above , bh masses of dbp emitters estimated from pure stellar velocity dispersion are about six times smaller than the virial bh masses .",
    "the bh masses estimated from line width of narrow emission lines are about several tens of times smaller than the virial bh masses .",
    "although , the slight correlation between bh masses @xmath24 and virial bh masses @xmath33 can be found for dbp emitters with stellar velocity dispersions , we can not confirm the result due to the small number of our sample .",
    "moreover , whether the line width of narrow emission lines can be used as the tracer of stellar velocity by @xmath70 for dbp emitters should be studied in the future using a large sample .",
    "more accurate estimation of bh masses for dbp emitter is necessary to estimate the fundamental physical parameter accretion rate @xmath6 . using the bh masses from equations 2a and 2b ,",
    "the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath6 is several times smaller than that based on the bh masses from @xmath1 .",
    "the mean dimensionless accretion rate @xmath6 is about 0.01 from the analysed results of 135 dbp emitters by bh masses estimated under the assumption of virialization ( wu & liu , 2004 , in their paper the bh masses are estimated from equation 2a and 2b ) .",
    "if we accept the bh masses ratio in our sample , the mean accretion rate @xmath6 based on the bh masses from stellar velocity dispersions should be about 0.1 .",
    "so , the adaf accretion flow ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 , mahadevan , 1997 ; mahadevan & quataert , 1997 ; narayan et al . , 1995 ) should just exist in a much smaller part of dbp emitters according to the value of accretion rate .",
    "we have shown that the relation between the size of blrs and continuum luminosity does not hold for dbp emitters . also , bh masses estimated from line width of narrow emission lines have large errors",
    ". the mean flux - weighted size of blrs is also several times smaller than the value estimated from the empirical relation @xmath13 .",
    "this is perhaps due to the following reasons according to the definition of ionization parameter : @xmath73 the first possible reason is due to the different value of @xmath74 between dbp emitters and normal agn .",
    "however , as we discussed in another paper ( zhang , dultzin - hacyan & wang 2007b ) , there is the same strong correlation between the luminosity of h@xmath8 and continumm luminosity @xmath7 for dbp emitters as that for normal agn ( greene & ho 2005b ) .",
    "thus , there are not much different effects of ionization continuum on the size of blrs for dbp emitters from those for normal agn .",
    "the second possible reason is due to higher electron density of blrs of dbp emitters than that of normal agn .",
    "more and more evidence indcates that double - peaked broad emission lines originate from the accretion disk near the central black hole as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this high electron density region is also responsible for broad feii emission lines observed in many agn ( ferland & person 1989 ) .",
    "the third possible reason is due to the different ionization parameter of blrs of dbp emitters .",
    "we think the higher electron density of blrs of dbp emitters is the dominated reasone which leads to smaller size of blrs .",
    "the last summary is : first : for dbp emitters , the bh masses estimated under the assumption of virialization using the continumm luminosity and line width of broad h@xmath0 are much larger than the bh masses from @xmath1 which is a more accurate relation .",
    "second , the sizes of the blrs of dbp emitters can not be estimated by the empirical relation of @xmath2 .",
    "sizes estimated from this relation are larger than the mean flux - weighted sizes of blrs of dbp emitters",
    ". the higher electron density of blrs of dbp emitters would be the main reason which leads to smaller size of blrs than that of normal agn .",
    "the dimensionless accretion rate , one of the fundamental parameters for agn , depends sensitively on the central bh masses , thus , to find a more accurate and convenient way to estimate the bh masses for dbp emitters is an important topic for the future .",

    "<S> in this paper , the sizes of the blrs and bh masses of double - peaked broad low - ionization emission line emitters ( dbp emitters ) are compared using different methods : virial bh masses vs bh masses from stellar velocity dispersions , the size of blrs from the continuum luminosity vs the size of blrs from the accretion disk model . </S>",
    "<S> first , the virial bh masses of dbp emitters estimated by the continumm luminosity and line width of broad h@xmath0 are about six times ( a much larger value , if including another dbp emitters , of which the stellar velocity dispersions are traced by the line widths of narrow emission lines ) larger than the bh masses estimated from the relation @xmath1 which is a more accurate relation to estimate bh masses . </S>",
    "<S> second , the sizes of the blrs of dbp emitters estimated by the empirical relation of @xmath2 are about three times ( a much larger value , if including another dbp emitters , of which the stellar velocity dispersions are traced by the line widths of narrow emission lines ) larger than the mean flux - weighted sizes of blrs of dbp emitters estimated by the accretion disk model . the higher electron density of blrs of dbp emitters would be the main reason which leads to smaller size of blrs than the predicted value from the continuum luminosity .    </S>",
