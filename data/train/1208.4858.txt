    "the search for new charged vector currents , generally called @xmath0 bosons , plays an important role in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "some theories propose higher mass @xmath8 boson resonances @xcite ; while others propose right - handed counterparts to the left - handed standard model @xmath8 in a broken @xmath9 symmetry @xcite . still others propose a heavy mass eigenstate in strongly interacting theories , such as non - commuting extended technicolor @xcite .",
    "all of the @xmath0 bosons in these theories enter the lagrangian with terms of the form @xmath10 which mirrors that of the standard model @xmath8 ( without the lepton sector if it is right - handed ) . while there could be left - right mixing , such mixing is constrained by @xmath11@xmath12 mixing @xcite ; hence , theories have been proposed that would suppress this naturally via orbifold breaking of the left - right symmetry @xcite or supersymmetric interactions @xcite .    while the phenomenology of models beyond the standard model ( sm ) is generally complex , it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath0 sectors can be factorized through next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd into terms of the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : l ] .",
    "hence , it was proposed that searches for direct resonances decaying into a @xmath13 final state be used to bound all such possible models that couple to quarks .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , a series of searches were performed by the cdf @xcite , and d0 @xcite collaborations at the fermilab tevatron , setting the world s strongest bounds on right - handed @xmath0 bosons , and competitive bounds on left - handed @xmath0 bosons @xcite .",
    "recent interest by the atlas and cms collaborations in extending these studies to the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , has prompted a re - examination of the reach and interpretation of these models .",
    "early results by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite utilize nlo cross sections from an early draft of this paper ( reproduced here in the appendix ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we compare our predictions with these first results .    in this paper",
    "we extend earlier predictions for the model - independent reach for @xmath0 bosons at a 14  tev lhc @xcite to 7  tev and 8  tev energies . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] we provide details of our detector simulation .",
    "we point out previously undescribed kinematic differences between right- and left - handed @xmath0 bosons ( @xmath14 ) that play a role in the reach at the lhc .",
    "in addition , we examine the effect of @xmath0 charge on the distributions at a @xmath15 collider . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] we propose a set of cuts for the model - independent analysis , and describe our predictions for the reach at the lhc for 7  tev and 8  tev .",
    "we conclude with suggestions for further research . in the appendix",
    ", we provide updated predictions for nlo @xmath0 cross sections for 7  tev and 8  tev @xmath15 colliders , including all theoretical uncertainties , for use by the coming experimental analyses .",
    "the signal of interest is @xmath16 , where the top quark decays as @xmath17 , and the @xmath8 decays leptonically to an electron or muon plus a neutrino . in order to simulate the full decay chain , including all angular correlations , we utilize a general @xmath0 model @xcite in madevent @xcite to produce parton - level signal and background events .",
    "these events are fed through pythia @xcite to generate initial- and final - state showering , and reconstructed in an atlas - like detector model in a modified pgs 4 @xcite detector simulation .",
    "we add an anti-@xmath18 jet reconstruction algorithm to pgs in order to match the current jet algorithms used by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "we use a cone size of @xmath19 for the anti-@xmath18 cutoff , and apply a jet energy scale ( jes ) correction to recover energy lost due to detector resolution and limited cone size .",
    "this jes correction is extracted from identified @xmath20 jets in a @xmath21 test sample .",
    "the resulting correction is small for jet energies grater than @xmath22 gev , and is implemented by scaling the jet four - momentum as @xmath23 after the jet energy correction is applied , we find very little dependence in the final results on cone sizes between @xmath19@xmath24 .",
    "an important feature in reducing backgrounds to the @xmath13 final state is the use of @xmath20 tagging .",
    "we model @xmath20-tagging with the default pgs tight - tagging algorithm , modified to include muon tracks inside of a jet . for the cuts we employ below this",
    "leads to @xmath25 @xmath20-tagging efficiency , with a somewhat over - estimated @xmath26 mistag rate for light quarks , and a charm mistag rate of @xmath27 .",
    "the effect of other @xmath20-tagging scenarios is addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "since our interest is in @xmath0 bosons with masses near or above 1  tev , we expect the @xmath20-jet that recoils against the top quark in the event to have a transverse energy @xmath28@xmath29 gev . at this stage",
    "it is unclear what the ultimate @xmath20-tagging efficiency will be for these high energy jets , however , we expect the decay products of the @xmath30 hadrons to be so boosted that secondary vertex reconstruction will be difficult . for the purposes of this study",
    "we assume that we are unable to make use of @xmath20-tagging for the leading jet in our events .",
    "should an algorithm for high efficiency and high purity @xmath20 jets near 1  tev be developed , it could improve the signal purity .",
    "the primary backgrounds of this @xmath0-induced @xmath31-channel single - top - quark process will be @xmath32-channel single - top - quark production , @xmath33 decaying to a lepton plus jets , and @xmath34 production . @xmath32-channel",
    "single - top - quark production is significant because the lead jet and the top quark will have a large invariant mass due to the large angular separation between decay products .",
    "@xmath34 is a major background strictly because its large cross section compensates for its small light jet mistag rate .",
    "other important backgrounds are the dilepton decay channel of @xmath33 , where one of the leptons is lost within a jet , other @xmath35jet events ( @xmath36 ) , and standard model @xmath31-channel single - top - quark production .",
    "background events are reweighted to match their nlo cross sections using a scale of 1  tev calculated using mcfm @xcite after acceptance cuts , and cteq 6.6 parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31- and @xmath32-channel single - top - quark normalizations are confirmed with matching to ztop @xcite .",
    "normalizing the @xmath0 signal to nlo is somewhat more subtle .",
    "here we use the code from ref .",
    "@xcite updated for 7 and 8  tev @xmath15 colliders ( see the appendix for inclusive cross sections with theoretical errors ) .",
    "the normalization for right - handed @xmath3 bosons is straight - forward , but left - handed @xmath6 bosons can interfere with standard model @xmath8-propagated single - top - quark production . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0@xmath8 interference can be constructive , destructive , or negligible , depending on the sign and size of the @xmath37 term in the @xmath0 mixing matrix with respect to the other elements ; a positive term ( as is usually assumed @xcite ) in the mixing matrix yields a destructive interference , while a negative term in the mixing matrix provides a constructive interference .",
    "we consider the two limiting cases of fully destructive and constructive interference below in order to bound the range of possible results .    to fix the nlo normalization for left - handed @xmath6 bosons , we extract a @xmath11-factor after cuts from the case of no interference , and scale up or down the events in the interfering cases by the same @xmath11-factor .",
    "we justify and quantify the error in this approximation as follows : first , we observe in fig .  [",
    "fig : noncondescs ] that for maximal sm - like coupling ( @xmath38 ) the interference can be large in certain regions of reconstructed invariant mass of the @xmath13 .",
    "fortunately , we are only interested in large invariant masses  close to the @xmath0 boson mass  where the interference is never more than @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath11-factor itself is typically @xmath40 for the masses we consider .",
    "furthermore , both standard model single - top - quark production and @xmath6 production have identically factorizable matrix amplitudes @xcite at nlo .",
    "hence , they receive the same qcd corrections at nlo .",
    "put together , we estimate the maximum error we introduce by using leading - order interference and normalizing in this fashion is @xmath41 or 4% .",
    "this error is negligible when compared with the 1030% error introduced by parton distribution function uncertainties ( listed in the appendix ) .     for a 1  tev sm - like left - handed @xmath0 boson and standard model @xmath42 @xmath31-channel production processes .",
    "these processes can be non - interfering , constructively interfering ( @xmath43 int . ) , or destructively interfering ( @xmath44 int . ) , but at the large invariant mass relevant for discovery the interference is small . [",
    "fig : noncondescs ] ]      the inclusive cross sections for right- and left - handed @xmath0 bosons decaying to @xmath13 differ mostly in their branching fractions . since there are no light right - handed neutrinos , we expect roughly @xmath45 as many @xmath13 from @xmath3 decay as from @xmath6 decay .",
    "the larger branching fraction suggests there will be a slightly better reach for right - handed bosons than left - handed bosons .",
    "this is true , but there are kinematic differences between right- and left - handed bosons , as well as between @xmath46 and @xmath47 bosons , that affect the acceptances and reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "spin correlations , usually considered as a way to distinguish right - handed from left - handed @xmath0 bosons , also modify the distributions of jets and leptons in the detector .",
    "the dominant parton luminosity for @xmath0 boson production involves a valence - sea quark combination , @xmath48 or @xmath49 . on average",
    "this leads to a forward boost of the @xmath0 bosons and their decay products in the direction of the valence quark .",
    "spin correlations between the down - type parton in the initial state and the @xmath20-jet from the top quark decay , or the @xmath50 and the charged lepton from the @xmath8 decay affect right- and left - handed @xmath0 bosons differently .",
    "bottom jets from the top quark in @xmath3 decay are partially antialigned with the @xmath3 direction , leading to a slightly softer transverse energy @xmath51 spectrum than for @xmath6 bosons . in fig .",
    "[ fig : etblr ] we see this softer @xmath52 spectrum for 1  tev @xmath3 vs.  @xmath6 bosons .",
    "this feature reduces our final prediction of the reach for right - handed @xmath0 bosons at lower masses , as a large fraction of events fail to pass minimal jet acceptance cuts .",
    "lepton acceptance is also reduced for @xmath3 bosons , as the spin correlations make them more forward ; though we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : etaleplr ] the effect is small .",
    "jet @xmath53 for @xmath3 and @xmath6 bosons with a mass of 1  tev . ]     for @xmath3 and @xmath6 bosons with a mass of 1  tev . ]",
    "more striking than left - right differences , are the differences between @xmath46 and @xmath47 bosons .",
    "the cross section for @xmath46 is roughly twice that of @xmath47 , since there are roughly twice as many valence @xmath54 quarks as valence @xmath50 quarks in the proton .",
    "the spin correlations exaggerate the effect to produce very different rapidity distributions for the final state particles .",
    "the leading jet in the @xmath47 decay is more central in pseudorapidity @xmath55 than in @xmath46 decay , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_jet+- ] for right - handed @xmath0 bosons .",
    "fortunately , detector acceptance at the lhc covers the entire rapidity range for both .",
    "the lepton pseudorapidity @xmath56 in fig.[fig : eta_lep+- ] , however , is more forward for @xmath46 than for @xmath47 .",
    "this will lead to a slightly different detector response between the two production modes . in this analysis we sum over both @xmath46 and @xmath47 production with the same cuts , but",
    "future studies might consider optimizing cuts for @xmath46 and @xmath47 analyses separately .",
    "and @xmath57 decays for a @xmath0 mass of 1  tev .",
    "[ fig : eta_jet+- ] ]     and @xmath57 decays for a @xmath0 mass of 1  tev . [ fig : eta_lep+- ] ]",
    "we propose a simple cut - based search for @xmath0 bosons that is effective at 7  tev and 8  tev energies at the lhc . while we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] several strong angular correlations that affect acceptances , we find that the ultimate significance of a @xmath0 signal in the presence of backgrounds is dominated by purely kinematic effects .",
    "hence , we make use of those distinctive kinematic features here .    in this analysis we are examining the @xmath58 final state , where @xmath59 is an electron or muon . since all of our signal events are fairly central , we begin with a basic set of detector acceptance cuts that require at least two jets with @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 , one lepton with @xmath62 gev and @xmath63 , and missing transverse energy @xmath64 gev .",
    "( all cuts are summarized in table [ tab : cuttable ] . ) at the level of acceptance cuts the signal to background ratio @xmath65 for a canonical right - handed @xmath0 boson with standard model - like couplings ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the tables are listed in femtobarns at nlo .",
    "the cross section uncertainties are completely dominated by the errors in the cteq 6.6 parton distribution functions @xcite , and are calculated using the standard modified tolerance method @xcite . in order of importance ,",
    "other uncertainties included are estimates of higher - order effects evaluated by scale variation , and current measurements of the coupling @xmath67 , and the top quark mass @xcite .",
