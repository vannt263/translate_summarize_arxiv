    "the two nearby galaxies  m31 and m33 , are stepping stones to most of our current effort to understand the evolving universe at large scales . first , they are essential to the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale ( jacoby et al .  1992 ; tonry et al .  1997 ) .",
    "second , they constrain population synthesis models for early galaxy formation and evolution , and provide the stellar luminosity calibration .",
    "there is one simple requirement for all this  accurate distances .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) have the potential to establish distances to m31 and m33 with an unprecedented accuracy of better than 5% and possibly to better than 1% .",
    "these distances are now known to no better than 10 - 15% , as there are discrepancies of @xmath1 between rr lyrae and cepheids distance indicators ( e.g.  huterer , sasselov & schechter 1995 ) .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries ( for reviews see andersen 1991 , paczyski 1997 ) offer a single step distance determination to nearby galaxies and may therefore provide an accurate zero point calibration  a major step towards very accurate determination of the hubble constant , presently an important but daunting problem for astrophysicists ( see the papers from the recent `` debate on the scale of the universe '' : tammann 1996 , van den bergh 1996 ) .",
    "the detached eclipsing binaries have yet to be used ( huterer et al .",
    "1995 ; hilditch 1996 ) as distance indicators to m31 and m33 .",
    "according to hilditch ( 1996 ) , there are about 60 eclipsing binaries of all kinds known in m31 ( gaposchkin 1962 ; baade & swope 1963 ; baade & swope 1965 ) and only _ one _ in m33 ( hubble 1929 ) !",
    "only now does the availability of large format ccd detectors and inexpensive cpus make it possible to organize a massive search for periodic variables , which will produce a handful of good deb candidates .",
    "these can then be spectroscopically followed - up with the powerful new 6.5 - 10 meter telescopes .",
    "the study of cepheids in m31 and m33 has a venerable history ( hubble 1926 , 1929 ; gaposchkin 1962 ; baade & swope 1963 ; baade & swope 1965 ) . in the 80 s freedman & madore ( 1990 ) and freedman ,",
    "wilson & madore ( 1991 ) studied small samples of the earlier discovered cepheids , to build pl relations in m31 and m33 , respectively .",
    "however , both the sparse photometry and the small samples do not provide a good basis for obtaining direct baade - wesselink distances ( e.g. krockenberger , sasselov & noyes 1997 ) to cepheids  the need for new digital photometry has been long overdue .",
    "recently , magnier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) surveyed large portions of m31 , which have previously been ignored , and found some 130 new cepheid variable candidates .",
    "their light curves are however rather sparsely sampled and in @xmath2 band only .    in kaluzny",
    "et al .  ( 1998 ) ( hereafter : paper i ) , the first paper of the series , we presented the catalog of variable stars found in one of the fields in m31 , called m31b . here",
    "we present the catalog of variables from the neighboring field m31a . in sec.2",
    "we discuss the selection of the fields in m31 and the observations . in sec.3",
    "we describe the data reduction and calibration . in sec.4",
    "we discuss briefly the automatic selection we used for finding the variable stars . in sec.5",
    "we discuss the classification of the variables . in sec.6",
    "we present the catalog of variable stars .",
    "m31 was primarily observed with the mcgraw - hill 1.3-meter telescope at the mdm observatory .",
    "we used the front - illuminated , loral @xmath3 ccd wilbur ( metzger , tonry & luppino 1993 ) , which at the @xmath4 station of the 1.3-meter has a pixel scale of @xmath5 and field of view of roughly @xmath6 .",
    "we used kitt peak johnson - cousins @xmath7 filters .",
    "some data for m31 were also obtained with the 1.2-meter telescope at the flwo , where we used `` andycam '' with thinned , back - side illuminated , ar coated loral @xmath3 ccd . the pixel scale happens to be essentially the same as at the mdm 1.3-meter telescope .",
    "we used standard johnson - cousins @xmath7 filters .",
    "fields in m31 were selected using the mit photometric survey of m31 by magnier et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and haiman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ( see paper i , fig.1 ) .",
    "we selected six @xmath8 fields , m31a  f , four of them ( a  d ) concentrated on the rich spiral arm in the north - eastern part of m31 , one ( e ) coinciding with the region of m31 searched for microlensing by crotts & tomaney ( 1996 ) , and one ( f ) containing the giant star formation region known as ngc206 ( observed by baade & swope 1963 ) . fields a  c were observed during september and october 1996 58 times per night in the @xmath2 band , resulting in total of 110 - 160 @xmath2 exposures per field .",
    "fields d  f were observed once a night in the @xmath2-band . some exposures in @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands",
    "were also taken .",
    "m31 was also occasionally observed at the flwo 1.2-meter telescope , whose main target was m33 .    in this paper",
    "we present the results for the m31a field .",
    "we obtained for this field useful data during 29 nights at the mdm , collecting a total of 109 exposures of @xmath11 in @xmath2 , 27 exposures of @xmath12 in @xmath10 and 2 exposures of @xmath13 in @xmath9 .",
    "we also obtained for this field useful data during 15 nights at the flwo , collecting a total of 8 exposures of @xmath11 in @xmath2 and 18 exposures of @xmath12 in @xmath10 .",
    "the complete list of exposures for this field and related data files are available through anonymous ftp on cfa-ftp.harvard.edu , in pub / kstanek / direct directory .",
    "please retrieve the readme file for instructions .",
    "additional information on the direct project is available through the www at http://cfa - www.harvard.edu/~kstanek / direct/.",
    "the details of the reduction procedure are given in paper i. preliminary processing of the ccd frames was done with the standard routines in the iraf - ccdproc package .",
    "stellar profile photometry was extracted using the _ daophot / allstar _ package ( stetson 1987 , 1991 ) .",
    "we selected a `` template '' frame for each filter using a single frame of particularly good quality .",
    "these template images were reduced in a standard way ( paper i ) .",
    "other images were reduced using _",
    "allstar _ in the fixed - position - mode using as an input the transformed object list from the template frames . for each frame",
    "the list of instrumental photometry derived for a given frame was transformed to the common instrumental system of the appropriate `` template '' image .",
    "photometry obtained for the @xmath2 & @xmath10 filters was combined into separate data bases . unlike for the m31b field , m31a images obtained at the flwo were reduced using mdm `` templates '' .    to obtain the photometric calibration we observed 4 landolt ( 1992 ) fields containing a total of 18 standards stars .",
    "these fields were observed through @xmath7 filters at air - masses ranging from 1.2 to 1.70 .",
    "the transformation from the instrumental to the standard system was derived and described in paper i. the derived transformation satisfactorily reproduces the @xmath2 magnitudes and @xmath14 colors .",
    "the @xmath15 transformation reproduces the standard system poorly , and we decided to drop the @xmath9 data from our analysis , especially since we took only 2 @xmath9 frames .    to check the internal consistency of our photometry we compared the photometry for 20 @xmath16 and 47 @xmath17 common stars in the overlap region between the fields m31a and m31b ( paper i , fig.1 )",
    "there was an offset of @xmath18 in @xmath2 and @xmath19 in @xmath10 , i.e. well within our estimate of the @xmath20 systematic error discussed in paper i. we also derived equatorial coordinates for all objects included in the data bases for the @xmath2 filter .",
    "the transformation from rectangular coordinates to equatorial coordinates was derived using @xmath21 stars identified in the list published by magnier et al .",
    "the procedure for selecting the variables was described in detail in paper i , so here we only give a short description , noting changes when necessary .",
    "the reduction procedure described in previous section produces databases of calibrated @xmath2 and @xmath10 magnitudes and their standard errors .",
    "the @xmath2 database for m31a field contains 10084 stars with up to 117 measurements , and the @xmath10 database contains 21341 stars with up to 45 measurements .",
    "fig.[fig : dist ] shows the distributions of stars as a function of mean @xmath22 or @xmath23 magnitude .",
    "as can be seen from the shape of the histograms , our completeness starts to drop rapidly at about @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the primary reason for this difference in the depth of the photometry between @xmath2 and @xmath10 is the level of the combined sky and background light , which is about three times higher in the @xmath10 filter than in the @xmath2 filter .",
    "the measurements flagged as `` bad '' and measurements with errors exceeding the average error by more than @xmath26 are removed ( paper  i ) .",
    "usually 010 points are removed , leaving the majority of stars with roughly @xmath27 @xmath2 measurements . for further analysis",
    "we use only those stars which have at least @xmath28 measurements .",
    "there are 8521 such stars in the @xmath2 database of the m31a field .",
    "our next goal is to select objectively a sample of variable stars from the total sample defined above .",
    "there are many ways to proceed , and we largely follow the approach of stetson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the procedure is described in more detail in paper  i. in short , for each star we compute the stetson s variability index @xmath29 ( paper i , eq.7 ) , and stars with values exceeding some minimum value @xmath30 are considered candidate variables .",
    "the definition of stetson s variability index includes the standard errors of individual observations .",
    "if , for some reason , these errors were over- or underestimated , we would either miss real variables , or select spurious variables as real ones .",
    "using the procedure described in paper i , we scale the _ daophot _ errors to better represent the `` true '' photometric errors .",
    "we then select the candidate variable stars by computing the value of @xmath29 for the stars in our @xmath2 database .",
    "we used a cutoff of @xmath31 and additional cuts described in paper i to select 183 candidate variable stars ( about 2% of the total number of 8521 ) . in fig.[fig : stetj ] we plot the variability index @xmath29 vs. apparent visual magnitude @xmath22 for 8521 stars with @xmath32 .",
    "we based our candidate variables selection on the @xmath2 band data collected at the mdm and the flwo telescopes .",
    "we also have the @xmath10 band data for the field , up to 27 mdm epochs and up to 18 flwo epochs . as mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath10 photometry is not as deep as the @xmath2 photometry , so some of the candidate variable stars do not have an @xmath10 counterpart .",
    "we will therefore not use the @xmath10 data for the period determination and broad classification of the variables .",
    "we will however use the @xmath10 data for the `` final '' classification of some variables .",
    "next we searched for the periodicities for all 183 candidate variables , using a variant of the lafler - kinman ( 1965 ) technique proposed by stetson ( 1996 ) .",
    "starting with the minimum period of @xmath33 , successive trial periods are chosen so @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the time span of the series .",
    "the maximum period considered is @xmath36 . for each candidate",
    "variable 10 best trial periods are selected ( paper i ) and then used in our classification scheme .",
    "the variables we are most interested in are cepheids and eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) .",
    "we therefore searched our sample of variable stars for these two classes of variables .",
    "as mentioned before , for the broad classification of variables we restricted ourselves to the @xmath2 band data .",
    "we will , however , present and use the @xmath10 band data , when available , when discussing some of the individual variable stars .    in the search for cepheids we followed the approach by stetson ( 1996 ) of fitting template light curves to the data .",
    "we used the parameterization of cepheid light curves in the @xmath2 band as given by stetson ( 1996 ) . unlike for the m31b field , we classified the star as a cepheid if the reduced @xmath37 of the fit was factor of 3 smaller than the reduced @xmath37 of a straight line fit , not a factor of 2 smaller .",
    "we also allowed for periods longer than @xmath38 , not longer than @xmath39 as in paper i , which resulted in finding two possible cepheids with periods @xmath40 .",
    "there was a total of 51 variables passing all of the criteria .",
    "their parameters and light curves are presented in the sections  6.2 ,  6.3 .",
    "for eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) we used similar search strategy to that described in detail in paper i , but we simplified the condition for the reduced @xmath37 of the fit to be at least 1.75 smaller than the reduced @xmath37 of a straight line fit . within our assumption the light curve of an eb is determined by nine parameters : the period , the zero point of the phase , the eccentricity , the longitude of periastron , the radii of the two stars relative to the binary separation , the inclination angle , the fraction of light coming from the bigger star and the uneclipsed magnitude .",
    "a total of 15 variables passing all of the criteria and their parameters and light curves are presented in the section  6.1 .",
    "after we selected 15 eclipsing binaries and 51 possible cepheids , we were left with 118 `` other '' variable stars . after raising the threshold of the variability index to @xmath41 ( paper i )",
    "we are left with 29 variables , which we preliminary classify as `` miscellaneous '' .",
    "we then go back to the ccd frames and try to see by eye if the inferred variability is indeed there , especially in cases when the light curve is very noisy / chaotic .",
    "we decided to remove 2 dubious cepheids and 18 dubious miscellaneous variables from the sample , which leaves 11 variables which we classify as miscellaneous .",
    "their parameters and light curves are presented in the section  6.4 .",
    "in this section we present light curves and some discussion of the 75 variable stars discovered in our survey .",
    "complete @xmath2 and ( when available ) @xmath10 photometry and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) @xmath2 finding charts for all variables are available through the anonymous ftp on cfa-ftp.harvard.edu , in pub / kstanek / direct directory .",
    "please retrieve the readme file for the instructions and the list of files .",
    "these data can also be accessed through the www at the http://cfa - www.harvard.edu/~kstanek / direct/. the ccd frames for this field , and also for the m31b field , are available on request from k. z. stanek ( kstanek@cfa.harvard.edu ) .",
    "the variable stars are named according to the following convention : letter v for `` variable '' , the number of the star in the @xmath2 database , then the letter `` d '' for our project , direct , followed by the name of the field , in this case ( m)31a , e.g. v3407 d31a .",
    "tables  [ table : ecl ] , [ table : ceph ] , [ table : per ] and [ table : misc ] list the variable stars sorted broadly by four categories : eclipsing binaries , cepheids , other periodic variables and `` miscellaneous '' variables , in our case meaning `` variables with no clear periodicity '' .",
    "some of the variables which were found independently by survey of magnier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are denoted in the `` comments '' by `` ma97 i d '' , where the `` i d '' is the identification number assigned by magnier at al .",
    "we also identify several variables found by us in paper i.    note that this is a first step in a long - term project and we are planning to collect additional data and information of various kind for this and other fields . as a result , the current catalog might undergo changes , due to addition , deletion or re - classification of some variables .      in table  [ table : ecl ] we present the parameters of the 15 eclipsing binaries in the m31a field .",
    "the lightcurves of these variables are shown in figs.[fig : ecl1][fig : ecl3 ] , along with the simple eclipsing binary models discussed in the paper i. the variables are sorted in the table  [ table : ecl ] by the increasing value of the period @xmath44 . for each eclipsing binary",
    "we present its name , 2000.0 coordinates ( in degrees ) , value of the variability index @xmath29 , period @xmath44 , magnitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the system outside of the eclipse , and the radii of the binary components @xmath47 in the units of the orbital separation .",
    "we also give the inclination angle of the binary orbit to the line of sight @xmath48 and the excentricity of the orbit @xmath49 .",
    "the reader should bear in mind that the values of @xmath50 and @xmath49 are derived with a straightforward model of the eclipsing system , so they should be treated only as reasonable estimates of the `` true '' value .",
    "one of the eclipsing binaries found , v4636 d31a , is a good deb candidate , with reasonably deep eclipses and the ellipticity indicating that the system is young and unevolved .",
    "however , much better light curve is necessary to accurately establish the properties of the system .      in table  [ table : ceph ] we present the parameters of 43 cepheids in the m31a field , sorted by the period @xmath44 . for each cepheid",
