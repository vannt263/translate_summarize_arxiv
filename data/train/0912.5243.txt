    "in the cores of nearby galaxy clusters early - type ( e / s0 ) galaxies are the dominant population ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , at modest redshifts ( z@xmath20.3 ) the fraction of blue , star - forming disk galaxies is substantially higher @xcite .",
    "this rapid recent evolution in the disk galaxy population of clusters provides an excellent opportunity to study the decline of star formation in galaxies , and its causes , and has thus spurred numerous observational and theoretical studies .    the two most prevalent mechanisms for driving disk galaxy evolution in clusters are ( 1 ) interaction between the galaxy interstellar medium ( ism ) with the diffuse hot intracluster medium ( icm ) and ( 2 ) gravitational tidal effects . in the first mechanism either ram pressure",
    "directly strips the galaxy ism @xcite via momentum transfer , thermal conduction , and/or viscous stripping removes the ism through energy transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the second mechanism , gas removal is achieved either through major or minor galaxy - galaxy encounters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , through tidal interaction of the galaxy with the cluster potential @xcite or through `` harrassment '' of a galaxy from numerous impulsive encounters @xcite .",
    "several cases of asymmetric hi , h@xmath0 , and radio continuum emission in cluster galaxies have provided detailed and convincing evidence for ram pressure effects @xcite , and gas dynamical simulations that reproduce the observations in detail are becoming increasingly sophisticated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* among others ) .",
    "nevertheless , tidal interactions are observed to be increasingly common in clusters at higher redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus appear to play an important role as well , especially when galaxies first enter the main cluster in small groups with relatively low velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is in any case clear that ram pressure stripping is more effective on extraplanar and diffuse interstellar gas in galaxies , and tidal interactions indeed produce diffuse extraplanar gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence recent studies tend to advocate a synergy between ram pressure and tidal effects in depleting the ism in cluster disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , while in principle these mechanisms may completely deplete the ism of galaxies in the right circumstances , recent studies have tended to support the proposal by @xcite that `` starvation '' or `` strangulation '' of the disk occurs when the ( more vulnerable ) gas resupply from the outer disk and hot gaseous halo is cut off by the combined effects of ram pressure and tidal interaction @xcite .",
    "evidence for gas depletion and altered sfr in cluster spirals , and for the mechanisms driving the observed depletion , is extensively reviewed in @xcite and in @xcite .    while the fraction of s0 galaxies is highest in the cores of present epoch galaxy clusters , s0s",
    "do exist as well in poor clusters and in lower density environments .",
    "given that the balance between ram pressure and tidal effects should vary with environment , an analysis of gas depletion characteristics for galaxies in low density versus rich cluster environments should provide additional constraints on the gas depletion process .",
    "the lower velocity dispersions of galaxies in groups should favor tidal interaction over ram pressure effects , when compared to the high velocity dispersion environments of rich clusters .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite has found that partial ram pressure stripping of the less massive spirals should be possible in group environments .",
    "in fact , several observational studies have found both individual and statistical evidence for partially hi - depleted galaxies in the group environment .",
    "one notable example is the spiral galaxy ngc 2276 in the ngc 2300 galaxy group , which has an asymmetric morphology and high star formation rate indicative of interaction between ngc 2276 and its environment @xcite , is moderately hi deficient by a factor of @xmath32 @xcite , and is located in the first loose galaxy group for which extended x - ray emission has been discovered @xcite .",
    "similarly , hi imaging of spirals in the holmberg 124 group @xcite , eridanus group @xcite , and four x - ray bright groups @xcite find modest hi deficiencies , as well as peculiar hi morphologies indicative of asymmetrical and/or extraplanar gas .",
    "since ram pressure alone appears incapable of clearing out the hi disks to the level observed , @xcite and @xcite suggest that a combination of tidally assisted ram pressure stripping and evaporation by thermal conduction may be the source of the observed hi deficiencies .",
    "in addition , @xcite find statistical evidence for a greater hi depletion for galaxies inhabiting x - ray bright groups compared to groups without detected x - ray emission .",
    "evidence has also been presented for hi - depleted galaxies at such large radial distance in the virgo cluster that the galaxies can not have yet experienced the central cluster environment @xcite .",
    "however , distance and modeling uncertainties may be sufficiently large that the possibility of these galaxies having passed through the virgo cluster core remains open @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite show that the hi mass function in galaxies exhibits some environmental trends , even at local densities that are substantially below the rich cluster level .",
    "a question that naturally arises is whether the hi deficiencies in galaxies translate as well into reduced star formation rates , and if so , how the reduction of star formation is distributed within the disk . as koopmann & kenney ( 2004a , b ; hereafter kk04ab ) , fumagalli & gavazzi ( 2008 ; hereafter fg08 ) , and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have pointed out , the characteristics of both global sfr in hi - depleted galaxies and the detailed sfr profiles in those galaxies can shed light on the mechanism(s ) causing the loss of gas in the high def spirals ; hi imaging is similarly pertinent @xcite .",
    "a particular emphasis of these previous studies has been to characterize whether the reduced sfr that accompanies hi depletion in virgo cluster spirals is a result of disk truncation , or whether a more general quenching is occurring of the sfr throughout a normal sized disk .",
    "in fact , there is some disagreement between fg08 and kk04ab on this question .",
    "kk04ab have carried out a comprehensive investigation of star formation rates in virgo cluster spirals on the basis of h@xmath0 and r band imaging .",
    "they find relatively few examples of `` quenched '' galaxies , i.e. , with globally lowered sfr in a disk of normal extent .",
    "rather , approximately 50% of the disks in their virgo spirals are truncated in h@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , kk04a find a general correspondence between h@xmath0 and hi disk sizes and between the morphologies of their h@xmath0 disks and the hi disk types found by @xcite . on the other hand , while fg08 do find that the most hi - depleted disks in their virgo sample are truncated in h@xmath0 as well , the more modestly depleted hi disks exhibit a more global depression of sfr in an otherwise normal disk size .",
    "fg08 thus argue that disk quenching is the key process in virgo cluster spirals , rather than disk truncation .",
    "clearly , a resolution of the roles of disk truncation versus quenching , in a broad range of environments in addition to the virgo cluster , would be of considerable importance in assessing what mechanism is chiefly responsible for the removal of atomic gas in galaxy disks .    in a recent study , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l07 ) found evidence for mild ( factor of 2 ) hi deficiencies for many spirals in the pegasus i cluster , which is a low velocity dispersion poor cluster with low x - ray emission .",
    "hi imaging of a few of the gas - deficient spirals showed asymmetries and reduced hi - to - optical disk diameters that further emphasized the anomalous properties of those galaxies . the low ram pressure in pegasus",
    "i , as in the galaxy groups mentioned above , provides an interesting intermediate environment in which to assess the sources of hi deficiencies in disk galaxies .    in this paper , we present optical r band and h@xmath0 imaging of many of the pegasus i cluster spirals , as well as other spirals with a variety of hi deficiencies . the goal is to evaluate the connection between star formation properties ( i.e. , both global and radial star formation profiles ) and atomic gas depletion for galaxies in environments outside of rich clusters , with particular emphasis on the pegasus i galaxy cluster that formed the basis of the l07 study .",
    "our objective is to provide additional constraints on the gas depletion process , with the focus on how such activity occurs in the group environment . in ",
    "2 we describe the galaxy samples observed by us , the hi and optical observational data , and the data analysis methods . in ",
    "3 we present both the radial star formation profiles and global rates extracted from the h@xmath0 and r band imaging , and relate them to the data on hi deficiency . finally , in  4 a discussion of our results is given in the context of other evidence for the sources of hi deficiency in spiral galaxies , and a brief summary is given in  5 .",
    "our analysis of the connection between atomic gas depletion and sfrs in galaxies is based on two samples of spiral galaxies .",
    "the first is the list of 54 spirals in the pegasus i galaxy cluster , as well as 17 spirals in a variety of environments approximately 1@xmath4 to the east of pegasus , that formed the basis of the l07 study .",
    "global hi measurements were obtained for all of these galaxies with the arecibo 305  m radiotelescope for the l07 study . in this paper",
    "we supplement those previous 21 cm observations with optical b and r band and h@xmath0 imaging of 29 of the pegasus i galaxies and 3 of the galaxies to the east of pegasus .",
    "we refer to this sample of 32 galaxies as the l07 sample . as discussed in l07 the pegasus i cluster",
    "can be divided into three distinct groups , a central group with 3400@xmath5cz@xmath54400 km s@xmath6 , a foreground group , with 2500@xmath5cz@xmath73400 km s@xmath6 , and a background group , with 4400@xmath7cz@xmath56000 .",
    "the background group appears to link up with the perseus - pisces supercluster @xcite .",
    "a second sample of spiral galaxies , for which homogeneous global hi data is available from the literature , was observed in b , r , and h@xmath0 to fill out the optical imaging program when the primary pegasus i targets were at excessive airmass .",
    "we refer to this second sample of 15 galaxies as the supplementary sample . specifically , we selected non - cluster sa - sc galaxies from the ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter s05a ) catalog for which arecibo observations have been made , and covering a variety of hi deficiencies ( the nature of the s05a catalog is further discussed in  2.2 ) .",
    "we also restricted the sample to the redshift range 2700@xmath7cz@xmath75500 km s@xmath6 , which corresponds to the useful range of the 100    wide h@xmath0 interference filter used for the observations .",
    "furthermore , we intentionally selected galaxies covering a range in neutral hydrogen deficiency ( hi deficiency is defined in the next section ) .",
    "hence our supplementary sample is far more biased towards galaxies with larger hi deficiency than a random selection from the s05a catalog would produce .",
    "a key parameter for the galaxies in this supplementary sample ( as well as for the galaxies in the l07 sample ) is the local environment in which the galaxy is located .",
    "while different techniques have been applied to define local environment , including projected galaxy surface density on the sky , we have chosen to use a three - dimensional number density in which the position of each galaxy is calculated from its sky position and recessional velocity . to construct a density field",
    ", we used the updated zwicky catalog of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter uzc ) , which is 95% complete to a limiting magnitude of @xmath8 = @xmath9 mag , includes galaxies of all types , and covers most of the northern sky . using the sky positions and local - group  corrected redshifts of the objects in the uzc , and adopting a value of the hubble constant of = 75 km s@xmath6",
    ", we assign each galaxy a 3d position in a cartesian coordinate system . to calculate the local density , we find the mean distance to an object s six nearest neighbors , and use that distance to define the radius of a sphere containing the `` local '' region .",
    "the number of objects contained within the sphere is divided by the physical volume of the sphere to obtain a number density in units of mpc@xmath10 .",
    "this number density is then corrected for the ( in)completeness of the galaxy luminosity function , relative to the degree of completeness at @xmath11 km s@xmath6 .",
    "specifically , we have multiplied all of the calculated densities by a lf correction factor which is the ratio of the integrated observable lf ( i.e. , the number of galaxies per mpc@xmath12 brighter than the limiting magnitude of the sample ) at 3000 km s@xmath6 to the integrated lf at the galaxy s redshift .",
    "we use a schechter lf @xcite derived from the uzc , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our dataset is based on two samples .",
    "the first , l07 , sample consists of arecibo hi data and optical b , r , and h@xmath0 imaging for 29 galaxies in the pegasus i cluster and 3 non - cluster galaxies to the east of pegasus .",
    "the second , supplementary , sample consists of 15 target of opportunity non - cluster galaxies for which arecibo data , compiled in a homogeneous manner in the s05a catalog , also exists .",
    "our combined sample is distinct from those of kk04ab and fg08 in that both of the latter samples are entirely based on the virgo cluster environment .",
    "in contrast , our galaxies span a range of lower density environments , with greatest emphasis on the spiral - rich low velocity dispersion pegasus i cluster .",
    "the range in luminosity of our galaxies is quite similar to that in kk04ab , while the luminous virgo spirals studied in fg08 are typically 1 - 1.5 mag more luminous than our spirals",
    ".    coordinates ( equinox 2000.0 ) for our galaxy sample , as well as morphological types , redshift information , and the above - described local number density are listed in table  [ tab : one ] .",
    "the morphological t type , given in column ( 5 ) , and the heliocentric redshift , in column ( 6 ) , are taken from hyperleda . the log density ( in galaxies per mpc@xmath12 )",
    "is given in column ( 7 ) .",
    "a description of the hi and optical data is given below .",
    "global hi measurements of 54 spiral galaxies in the pegasus i cluster , as well as for 17 spirals approximately 1@xmath4 east of pegasus , were obtained with the arecibo 305  m telescope by l07 .",
    "details on the observations are given in that paper .",
    "here we concentrate on the hi data for the 29 pegasus i spirals and 3 non - pegasus spirals for which we have newly acquired broadband optical and h@xmath0 imaging .    neutral hydrogen data for the 15 spirals in our second sample are taken from the s05a catalog , which consists of global hi fluxes for over 8,000 spiral galaxies observed with several radio telescopes over a span of some 20 years .",
    "the flux measurements have been re - processed to correct for instrumental effects such as beam attenuation and pointing offsets , as well as hi self - absorption in the observed galaxies .",
    "thus , the corrected fluxes can be assumed to be homogeneous . while the catalog also includes data from other radio telescopes , we have only used arecibo observations to avoid any instrument - to - instrument offsets .    for both the l07 galaxies and the supplementary 15 galaxies from the s05a catalog the global 21 cm flux",
    "is used to calculate the total hi mass of each galaxy .",
    "specifically , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the radial distance in kpc and @xmath17 is the corrected 21 cm flux density in jy km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the linear optical diameter is given by @xmath18 kpc , where @xmath19 , the angular major axis diameter , is also provided by the s05a catalog .",
    "the focus of this paper is to investigate the relationship between neutral hydrogen depletion in galaxy disks and the global and local star formation rates .",
    "to quantify the degree to which a particular galaxy is deficient in hi we must compare the observed hi content with the amount of hi that is _ expected _ in a galaxy of its morphological type and size .",
    "the logarithmic difference between the expected and observed gas content will then represent the gas deficiency of the galaxy ( def ) .",
    "here we describe how the expected hi content is determined for the various galaxies in the l07 sample and in the supplementary sample of galaxies extracted from the s05a catalog .",
    "l07 calculate def values for the galaxies in the pegasus region using the prescription detailed in @xcite , as follows .",
    "first , we recall that there is a logarithmic correlation between a galaxy s hi mass and its linear diameter , with a slight dependence of the slope of the fit on morphological type .",
    "if a fit of @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 is performed on a sample of normal galaxies of the same morphological type , then the best fit line is taken to represent the expected hi mass as a function of linear diameter .",
    "at a given diameter , if the measured hi mass is less than that predicted by the fit to the sample , then the galaxy is defined to have a positive deficiency ( def ) , given by the logarithmic difference between the expected and the observed values : @xmath22 before one can perform these fits , however , a suitable sample of galaxies must be chosen to represent a `` normal '' population in terms of hi content . due to the increased likelihood of a galaxy to be gas deficient with increasing local density",
    ", this sample must be restricted to low density environments to base the deficiency measurement on galaxies whose gas content is dictated primarily by the fluctuations of secular evolution , not environmental effects . @xcite",
    "use a survey of 4620 galaxies from the perseus - pisces supercluster region , and define a low density sample of 2582 galaxies based on the sky - projected surface density of galaxies .",
    "all of the galaxies in low surface density regions are combined according to morphological type and used to perform the @xmath20-@xmath21 fit .",
    "a large galaxy sample is necessary due to the existence of a natural scatter around the mean @xmath20-@xmath21 relation .",
    "the slopes and zero - points from these fits are then used to determine the expected hi content for all of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "the def values of l07 come directly from these results .",
    "for the 15 galaxies in the supplementary sample we have used 21 cm flux measurements from s05a , as previously mentioned . unlike l07 , we have elected to define the `` normal '' galaxy population for hi content in a manner that is more consistent with our own local density measurements .",
    "the def values for these 15 galaxies are based on @xmath20-@xmath21 fits for a large galaxy sample drawn from the whole springob et al .",
    "( 2005a ) catalog , which the criterion that local galaxy densities be less than -1.0 log mpc@xmath10 ( as described in section 2.1 ) .",
    "we have also chosen a velocity range of 3,000 km s@xmath6 to 6,500 km s@xmath6 for selecting a low - density galaxy sample .",
    "the lower limit is applied to prevent peculiar velocities from dominating the observed redshift and affecting the line - of - sight distance measurements ( and , more specifically , to avoid the virgo supercluster ) .",
    "we apply an upper velocity limit of 6,500 km s@xmath6 due to the rapidly increasing uncertainty in the lf correction to the observed local density ( discussed in the previous section ) , which occurs as the observable lf becomes restricted to only the bright end at higher redshift . of the original @xmath238,000 galaxies in the s05a sample , about 3,000 galaxies",
    "meet the density and velocity criteria , which provides a large enough sample to span the necessary morphological types for fitting the @xmath20- @xmath21 relation .",
    "we then perform the same steps described above for calculating the def parameter on the s05a galaxies , where the expected hi mass is now given by the fits performed on our low density sample .",
    "it is important to verify that the hi flux and def data in l07 is consistently on the same scale as the hi flux data for the 15 galaxies in the supplementary sample extracted from hi flux data in s05a , and for which we produced a different definition of `` normal '' hi content .",
    "to do so , we have extracted hi flux data for all galaxies in common between l07 and s05a .",
    "for those 25 galaxies we have compared the def values given in l07 , which are based on their own arecibo hi data and on the @xcite prescription for `` normal '' hi content , with the def values calculated from the s05a hi data and with the `` normal '' hi content determined from our new fits to the @xmath20- @xmath21 relation . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rose1 ] , the agreement between the two data sources is good .",
    "the thick dashed line shows the linear least squares fit between the two def values for all 25 galaxies in common between l07 and s05a , while the thick solid line indicates the fit achieved when the single most discrepant galaxy , ngc  41 , is excluded .",
    "the slope of the fit is 0.96@xmath240.08 and 0.99@xmath240.06 with and without including ngc  41 ; the rms scatter about the linear fit is @xmath240.15 and @xmath240.12 respectively . we can not account for the discrepancy in def between the two sources in the case of ngc  41 , since the hi fluxes only differ by 16% and the morphological types assumed are the same .",
    "we attribute the difference to a calculation error in l07 . in the case of the next most discrepant galaxy , ugc164 , the larger def value given in l07 is attributable to the 50% lower hi flux reported by them .",
    "to maintain consistency with the previous work , we continue to use the l07 hi flux and def data for the galaxies in that paper , with the exception of ngc  41 , for which we adopt the flux data from s05a and def calculation based on the `` normal '' hi content derived for this paper .",
    "data on def for the galaxies in our combined sample is given in column ( 2 ) of table  [ tab : two ] .",
    "to illustrate the range of @xmath1 and log(@xmath25 ) covered by our pegasus i and non - cluster samples , we have plotted @xmath1 versus log(@xmath25 ) in fig .  [ fig : rose2 ] .",

    "broadband b and r and narrowband h@xmath0 ( both online and offline ) images were obtained for 29 galaxies in the pegasus i cluster and for 18 additional spiral galaxies with arecibo hi data with the 4.1-m soar telescope atop cerro pachon in chile during the time period august 2006 through august 2008 .",
    "all images were acquired with the soar optical imager ( soi ) .",

    "both filters have a fwhm of 100  .    for both the broadband b and r filters a series of three 150 second exposures",
    "was acquired . for the h@xmath0 online and offline filters ,",
    "three 300 second exposures were taken for each galaxy . on a typical night 4 - 6",
    "standard star fields from @xcite were observed , with typically 3 - 4 stars observed per field .",
    "all images were analyzed with the noao / iraf ` mscred ' package .",
    "each raw image consisted of four image extensions , given that there are two amplifiers on each ccd chip , and two chips in the soi instrument .",
    "first , the overscan on each amplifier was fit with a linear polynomial and removed , and the data frame was slightly trimmed .",
    "next , a master bias frame , combined from a median of typically 25 frames , was subtracted from all object and calibration images .",
    "flat fielding was accomplished by creating a master flat from typically six sky flat images , taken during evening and/or morning twilight , and with exposure times adjusted to reach a count level at approximately half of the linear range of the detector .",
    "the flats were median - combined in the ` flatcombine ' task , with rejection of minimum and maximum values .",
    "dome flats were taken as well in each filter every afternoon . in practice",
    "we found that dome flats and sky flats produced virtually identical results in the r bandpass , and in the h@xmath0 online and offline filters , i.e. , at red wavelengths .",
    "for the broadband b filter , there were significant differences between dome and sky flats , due to the plunging spectral energy distribution of the dome flats in the blue .",
    "hence sky flats in b were seen to make a far better match to the object frames , in terms of dividing out obvious structure in the raw images in scales of tens of pixels .",
    "we consequently used sky flats for all of our flat fielding . dividing through by the sky flat",
    "can be problematic if there is a significant field distortion over the full field of view of the image .",
    "however , in the case of soi the maximum scale variation from center to edge of field is only @xmath30.15% at red wavelengths .    at this point the image consisted of four extensions that had been individually treated .",
    "the next step was to combine the four amplifiers into a single mosaic image , using an iraf script written by dr .",
    "alexandre oliveira . finally , to combine the three individual exposures in each filter into a single frame required first registering the images , and then combining them with cosmic ray rejection .",
    "the tasks ` msccmatch ' and ` wregister ' were used in the ` mscred ' package to register the images .",
    "the ` combine ' task , with median scaling and averaging with the ` crreject ' cosmic ray rejection option , were used to combine the three frames into the final image .",
    "since the image quality can differ between the final r band and h@xmath0 online and offline images , the full width half maximum was determined for each bandpass from several stars in the field .",
    "then all images were gaussian convolved to the same fwhm as the worst seeing bandpass .",
    "accuracy of background subtraction typically is the limiting factor in pursuing galaxy surface photometry at low surface brightness levels .",
    "we found that even after bias subtraction and flat - field division there is often a residual discontinuity in the background level across amplifiers on a chip , and across the boundary between chips .",
    "the discontinuities could be as large as one adu per pixel in the broadband r images , out of a background of approximately 200 adu , and were usually not constant throughout the night .",
    "thus to keep our background subtraction accurate to the 10% level , we limited the surface photometry in the r bandpass to a minimum count level of 10 counts / pixel .",
    "based on the standard star data for the photometric nights , a level of 10 cts / pix corresponds to a surface brightness of @xmath324.75 mag  arcsec@xmath27 in r at the typical airmass of our observations .",
    "this surface brightness zero point is consistent with ` lick r ' band surface photometry given in @xcite for 5 galaxies in common with our sample .",
    "for those 5 galaxies the radius that we find at the r=24.75 mag  arcsec@xmath27 isophote is on average 7% smaller than the r=25 mag  arcsec@xmath27 isophotal radii determined by @xcite .",
    "we similarly restricted the h@xmath0 photometry to count levels brighter than 0.5 cts / pix in the online and offline filters .",
    "sky background was found from the median count levels in regions on the same chip as the galaxy that were found to be free of bright objects .",
    "these regions were defined interactively on the image and the mean value for the multiple regions was used as the final background level .    once the sky background was removed from the h@xmath0 online and offline images , aperture photometry was performed on several stars .",
    "the offline image was normalized to attain the same mean stellar counts as in the online image .",
    "the final h@xmath0 image is the difference between the online and normalized offline images .    for almost all of the finalized r band images",
    ", we used the ` ellipse ' task in the ` stsdas / isophote ' iraf package to determine an azimuthally averaged radial r band profile for each galaxy .",
    "the ` ellipse ' task starts with initial approximations to the x - y center , position angle , and ellipticity of the isophote at a specified radial distance , then , iterates to optimum values , then steps along to both larger and smaller radii . among the results tabulated at each azimuthally averaged radius are the surface brightness level , in counts / pix and in magnitudes , the total magnitude within the radius , and errors on all quantities .",
    "as mentioned above , we cut off our analysis at a surface brightness level of 10 cts / pix , corresponding to a surface brightness in r of @xmath324.75 mag / sq .",
    "arcsec . in a few cases the galaxy was either so close to edge - on , or so irregular in morphology ,",
    "that profile fitting could not be accomplished reliably . for those galaxies we instead used the ` polyphot ' task to interactively draw a polygonal boundary around the galaxy , within which the total magnitude was integrated .",
    "thus in these cases only a total r magnitude was determined , as opposed to radial profiles . with a little experimentation using both ` polyphot ' and ` ellipse ' tasks , we found that by eye a polygon could readily be drawn around a galaxy which returned the same global magnitude as produced from ` ellipse ' at the 10 cts / pix isophote .",
    "the h@xmath0 image is naturally less subject to stable isophote fitting than the r band image .",
    "consequently , for each galaxy we applied the x - y center , pa , and ellipticity information determined from the r band profile fitting to the h@xmath0 image . in the case of those galaxies for which only global r band magnitudes were attained with ` polyphot ' , the same polygon was applied to the h@xmath0 image .",
    "however , there were a few galaxies with just a few low luminosity hii regions .",
    "for those cases we carried out aperture photometry of the individual hii regions , and then calculated a combined h@xmath0 flux .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux includes as well the emission in the neighboring [ nii]@xmath286548,6584 forbidden lines .      from the above analysis we extracted the following information .",
    "first , we define the parameter @xmath29 , a global characterization of the star formation rate per unit stellar mass , by taking the base 10 logarithm of the total h@xmath0 flux within the 0.5 cts / pix isophote divided by the total r band flux within the 10 cts / pix isophote , as follows :    @xmath30    the @xmath29 parameter is essentially equivalent to the `` normalized massive star formation rate '' discussed in kk04ab .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux characterizes the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of massive stars , while the r band flux is a rough characterization of the total stellar mass , assuming that the mass to r band light ratio is roughly constant in our disk galaxy sample .",
    "since both the h@xmath0 and r band data were acquired within a short enough time period that the airmass of the galaxy did not change substantially , and since the r band and h@xmath0 filters are at similar wavelengths , the raw flux ratio did not require correction for extinction effects .",
    "we henceforth refer to this normalized sfr as the _ specific _ star formation rate , or ssfr .",
    "note that our version of the ssfr is slightly different than that used by other authors because we are not basing it on flux - calibrated h@xmath0 and r band photometry .",
    "thus the zeropoint of our ssfr values will differ from that of other investigators , but the relative values should be on the same scale .    as pointed out by fg08 , there is a systematic luminosity dependence in the sfr per h band luminosity , i.e. , more luminous galaxies have a lower ssfr .",
    "fg08 found a slope to that relation of -0.26 in the log of the sfr per unit h band luminosity versus the log of the h band luminosity , with a substantial ( @xmath30.3 mag ) scatter . to account for this trend in our analysis ,",
    "we have applied the fg08 correction as follows .",
    "we calculated the @xmath31 for all galaxies in our sample using the total h band magnitude and distance modulus given by hyperleda . in cases where hyperleda provides only the total b magnitude",
    ", we assumed an average @xmath32 color of 2.52 , determined from the mean of our sample for which data on both passbands is available .",

    "errors in the @xmath29 and @xmath33 values are difficult to assess , given that the photon statistical errors are exceedingly small , thus systematic errors dominate .",
    "we have identified two primary sources of systematic uncertainty , namely , ( 1 ) uncertainties in establishing the mean sky level and ( 2 ) uncertainties in fitting non - axisymmetric disk structure with ellipses and low order deviations .",
    "we evaluated the first uncertainty by experimenting with different sky levels , and the second with comparing isophotal fit fluxes with those extracted from subjectively defined enclosed polygons ( using the iraf polyphot ) task .",
    "we estimate the @xmath241@xmath38 errors in @xmath29 and @xmath33 ( and in the later defined @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 quantities ) to be @xmath420.15 mag .",

    "[ fig : rose5 ] we have plotted the ssfr parameter , @xmath33 , versus the hi def paramter . the large filled circle denotes the lower limit in def and upper limit in @xmath33 for ngc  7563 .",

    "[ fig : rose5 ] , there is a trend toward lower ssfr with increasing hi deficit .",
    "a linear least squares fit between @xmath33 and def , which does not include ngc  7563 , yields a correlation coefficient r=-0.68 , with rms scatter of 0.46 ; the probability that the two variables are uncorrelated is rejected at the 2 x 10@xmath44 level .",

    "the slope of the linear fit is -1.05@xmath240.17 .",
    "replacing @xmath33 with the `` uncorrected '' @xmath45 produces virtually identical results .",
    "as previously mentioned , fg08 found a substantial intrinsic scatter in their relationship between ssfr and l@xmath46 , thus a considerable intrinsic scatter is present in the global ssfr of galaxies , in addition to any dependance on @xmath1 or environment .",

    "we now consider whether in high def galaxies the ssfr is suppressed throughout the galaxy , or whether it is preferentially lower ( or higher ) at particular locations in the disk .",
    "as is discussed in  4 , this question has been addressed by kk04ab and fg08 for virgo cluster spirals , with some disagreement between the two studies . given that conclusions regarding the relative importance of starvation versus stripping phenomena can be arrived at from the characteristic depletion patterns in both ssfr and hi , the detailed radial profiles in @xmath49(r ) are worth a careful examination .",

    ", however , the appearance of a _ single _ outer spiral arm , as well as the almost perfect arc of hii regions , seems more consistent with a ram pressure event , such as the single leading spiral arm seen in the ram pressure numerical simulation of ( * ? ? ?",

    ", the @xcite simulation only follows the evolution of the gaseous disk .",
    "it appears unlikely that the stellar disk would exhibit the same asymmetric response .",
    "nevertheless , in cgcg  059 - 019 the r band light clearly shows the m=1 single - arm pattern . note that if the single arm is caused by the ram pressure effect modeled by @xcite , then the galaxy disk must be oriented nearly parallel with respect to its motion relative to the intragroup gas . hence the galaxy , according to the near circular appearance of the inner ring , must be moving almost exactly in the plane of the sky .",
    "cgcg  059 - 019 is a member of compact group # 65 in the catalog of @xcite , which contains 7 galaxies and has a velocity dispersion of 329 km s@xmath6 .",
    "thus it appears to be in a similar group environment to ngc  2276 in the ngc  2300 group . in any case , if it can be established that the single arm in cgcg  059 - 019 is indeed leading , then it may represent a key object for distinguishing ram pressure from tidal effects in the group environment . just as intensive studies of specific galaxies in rich clusters have led to unambiguous determinations of ram pressure effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , of tidal effects @xcite , and of both @xcite , a further investigation of cgcg  059 - 019 may provide unambiguous clues to the mechanism producing the m=1 spiral pattern in that galaxy .",
    "the other galaxy with exceptional morphology is ugc12497 , also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rose16 ] .",
    "this galaxy is a member of the central group of the pegasus i cluster , and has been classified as i m .",
    "while the outer isophotes of the r band image do indeed look like those of a single object , both the inner r band isophotes and h@xmath0 image are perhaps more indicative of two discrete spirals in the process of merging .",
    "if so , their line - of - sight relative velocity must be low at this point , since the hi profile width given by l07 is only 188 km s@xmath6 . the hi profile , shown in fig .  3.18 of l07 ,",
    "does have a small spike at @xmath33740 km s@xmath6 , indicative of a second still - discrete galaxy .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , both kk04ab and fg08 conclusively establish a relation between global ssfr and hi deficiency in virgo cluster spirals , but disagree as to whether truncation of the star - forming disk or global quenching in ssfr is the more important driver .",
    "fg08 argue that disk quenching is the key process in virgo cluster spirals while kk04ab find that truncation is important in approximately half of their virgo spirals .",
    "we now consider how the results of our study impact on the issue of disk truncation versus disk quenching .",
    "in this study we have found that the relation between global ssfr and atomic gas deficiency is evident as well in the pegasus i cluster and in other low - richness environments .",
    "naturally , it is an oversimplification to compare the `` pegasus environment '' with that of the `` virgo environment '' , since an individual virgo cluster galaxy may have experienced a wide range of different environmental histories over the past @xmath310 gyr , depending on the specifics of its group membership and orbital path through the greater cluster .",
    "neverthless , galaxies in the pegasus i cluster and in the `` non - cluster '' sample on average have experienced an environment that has a considerably lower peak ram pressure ( due to both lower galaxy velocity dispersion and to lower density of the icm ) than for virgo . thus it is interesting to see the correlation between global ssfr and def that is found in virgo continue in the environments inhabited by our galaxy sample .    regarding the issue of truncation versus starvation of disks , our results indicate a steady reduction in star - forming disk length with increasing def .",
    "this result , which is consistent with that found by kk04b in virgo cluster spirals , implies that gas is being preferentially removed from the outside of stellar disks by the processes at work in the less extreme environments sampled in our study . in comparing our results to that found by fg08 for virgo spirals , it is perhaps important that fg08 considered highly luminous galaxies , while the typical galaxy in our sample is @xmath31 - 1.5 mag less luminous .",
    "in addition , the spirals with truncated disks also have lower ssfr within the actively star - forming part of the disk than do gas - rich spirals with normal size disks .    an important difference between our results and that found previously in the virgo cluster environment",
    "is the high ( @xmath350% ) fraction of spirals with def@xmath20.2 that have high central ssfr .",
    "kk04b find three virgo spirals with high def that have severely truncated h@xmath0 disks , but high central sfr .",
    "all three galaxies have m@xmath63 between -18 and -19 , which is typical of our sample , but substantially fainter than the luminous spirals studied by fg08 .",
    "the three kk04b examples have higher def ( 0.79 , 1.23 , and @xmath231 ) and more severely truncated h@xmath0 disks than in our sample , but otherwise appear to have similar characteristics .",
    "however , those three galaxies only constitute @xmath38% of the virgo spirals studied by kk04b , while we find that @xmath350% ( although the number statistics are small ) of our spirals with def@xmath20.2 have high central ssfr .",
    "the two noteworthy differences between our galaxy sample and the virgo sample of kk04b are that ( 1 ) our galaxies are typically less gas - depleted than the virgo spirals , by about a factor of 2 - 4 , and ( 2 ) the environments inhabited by our sample are poor clusters and groups , as opposed to the denser virgo environment .",
    "the elevated ssfr in the centers of many partially hi - depleted spirals poses a particularly interesting problem . without an ongoing hi resupply , such high ( an order of magnitude higher than in normal spirals )",
    "central ssfrs are unsustainable , and thus indicate a transient evolutionary state .",
    "there are a number of galaxies in pegasus i which may in fact represent end products of this transient state of high central ssfr .",
    "@xcite found several galaxies in pegasus , classified as early - type , but with spectroscopic evidence of recent ( ngc  7557 , ngc  7611 , and ngc  7617 ) or still ongoing ( ngc  7648 ) central star formation .",
    "optical broadband imaging presented in @xcite further indicates recent centralized star formation .",
    "ngc  7648 may be a particularly relevant example .",
    "in addition to the broadband data in @xcite , b , r , and h@xmath0 imaging in l07 reveals that despite its s0 classification , ngc  7648 has highly centrally concentrated h@xmath0 emission , a bright off - nuclear blue knot , and ripples reminiscent of tidal interaction .",
    "the peaked hi profile for ngc  7648 suggests that the small amount of remaining hi is not in a cold rotating disk , thus probably also centrally concentrated .",
    "all of these characteristics indicate that ngc  7648 may represent the last transition stage before evolution into an s0 .",
    "the data for ngc  7563 presented in this paper are also indicative of a pre - s0 state .",
    "neither hi nor h@xmath0 are detected in this galaxy , but the central morphology is sufficiently structured that it has been classified as an sa .",
    "in fact , both ngc  7643 and ngc  7563 are likely examples of the `` problem '' of galaxy morphology emphasized by @xcite .",
    "hi - deficient galaxies in clusters tend to be mis - classified as earlier types than their central concentration parameters would indicate .",
    "naturally , once a disk galaxy becomes completely depleted in atomic and molecular gas , it will eventually be classified as an s0 , and then no longer be considered in samples of hi deficient galaxies , which are restricted to sa and later types . both ngc  7648 and",
    "ngc  7563 appear to be on the brink of the s0/a morphology .",
    "we note other possible examples of cluster galaxies with elevated central sfr . in an objective prism survey of eight nearby galaxy clusters ,",
    "@xcite find numerous spirals with centrally concentrated h@xmath0 emission .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite find examples of `` early - type '' galaxies in nearby clusters that have spectroscopic evidence for recent star formation .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy @xcite and _ hst _ imaging @xcite indicate that the recent star formation has been concentrated in the inner @xmath32 kpc of these galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied blue compact star - forming disk galaxies in the coma cluster . however , these spirals have elevated sfr throughout their truncated star - forming disks , which is distinct from our spirals that have truncated star - forming disks but _ lower _ sfr within the active disk , except for the very central region of elevated sfr .    in closing , we return to the key question regarding whether ram pressure and/or tidal gravitational effects are primarily responsible for the hi depletion in disk galaxies in poor cluster and group environments .",
    "have the data presented here informed this question in any decisive way ?",
    "we begin by summarizing the five principal conclusions from this study that are pertinent to the issue .",
    "first , the _ global _ ssfr is correlated with def , i.e. , lowered ssfr accompanies higher atomic gas depletion .",
    "second , there is a clear correlation between the h@xmath0-to - optical disk size ratio with def , i.e. , more hi - deficient galaxies have more truncated disks .",
    "third , truncation _ and _ suppression of ssfr ( within the star - forming part of the disk ) are both seen in the same disks , and contribute about equally to the ssfr - def correlation .",
    "fourth , the central ssfr is greatly enhanced in some high def galaxies .",
    "fifth , strong bars and a ring of hii regions at the end of the bar appear to be present in the high def galaxies with high central ssfr .",
    "finally , these effects are observed by us in the poor cluster and group environment .    are ram pressure stripping ( rps ) and/or tidal effects consistent with these observational trends ?",
    "let us first consider the case of strong rps .",
    "one might expect that with strong rps the disk will be hi - depleted in proportion to the strength of the ram pressure .",
    "thus a correlation between h@xmath0-to - optical disk size ratio might be expected , in addition to a correlation between global ssfr and def .",
    "thus the first two effects , and probably the third , will result in the strong rps case . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear why the fourth and fifth effects would be observed .",
    "bar structure and highly elevated central sfr are expected in the event that a non - axisymmetric structure is triggered ; strong rps does not obviously provide that trigger . and the fact that we onserve the various effects in galaxies in such low density environments is inconsistent with strong rps .    tidal interaction will naturally trigger non - axisymmetric disturbances , which will readily lead to the bar structures and high central ssfr . on the other hand , it is not all all clear how the h@xmath0-to - optical disk size ratio correlation with def will result .",
    "a tidal disturbance will tend to provide non - axisymmetric disturbances whose scale is _ internally _ set ( by the location of the inner lindblad resonance , i.e. , by the internal mass distribution and resultant rotation curve ) , rather than by the strength of the tidal disturbance .",
    "thus the h@xmath0 disk truncation radius will not obviously correlate with the magnitude of the disturbance , which presumably correlates with def .",
    "thus both strong rps and tidal disturbances appear to have opposite strengths and weaknesses when confronted by the observations .",
    "the case of weaker rps represents a potentially interesting middle ground .",
    "@xcite find that weaker rps leads to an atomic gas disk compression that in turn is unstable to growth of non - axisymmetric structure , which results in the `` annealing '' of the disk , i.e. , a shrunken disk of atomic gas .",
    "thus weak rps does produce a truncation of the disk . what is not clear , however , is whether the degree of the truncation will correlate with the strength of the ram pressure or whether , like in the case of tidal perturbations , one expects the scale to be set internally , by the nature of the galaxy s rotation curve .",
    "also unclear is whether the ssfr in the star - forming part of the disk will be suppressed .",
    "the disk annealing should in any event be accompanied by bar structure , gas inflow , and an elevated ssfr .    in short , there is considerable `` degeneracy '' in behavior between rps - induced and gravitationally - induced disk evolution .",
    "both mechanisms are capable of redistributing the angular momentum of the gas such that gas is driven to the galaxy centers , and both are capable of selectively removing the outer gas supply . consequently , although the observational results prsented here provide some interesting new constraints on any model for gas removal in disk galaxies , we do not see a clear signature at this point for any single mechanism .",
    "we have obtained h@xmath0 and r band imaging of 29 spiral galaxies in the spiral - rich pegasus i cluster and of 18 spirals in non - cluster environments .",
    "the h@xmath0 image is used to track the sfr , while the r band roughly tracks the total stellar light , and hence the stellar mass .",
    "we compare the logarithmic h@xmath0 to r band flux ratio ( i.e. , the logarithm of the sfr per unit stellar mass , or ssfr ) to the logarithmic hi deficiency parameter , @xmath1 , for our sample of disk galaxies .",
    "we find that global ssfr is well correlated with hi deficiency , from the most hi - rich to the most hi - poor galaxies , in the expected sense that gas - poor galaxies have lower global ssfrs .",
    "this establishes in lower density environments the same connection between hi deficiency and lowered sfr that has been observed before in rich clusters such as coma and virgo .",
    "we also find that the h@xmath0 disk size relative to the r band disk size correlates with @xmath1 , i.e. , h@xmath0 disks are truncated relative to the optical disk size in more gas - poor spirals . if the sfr in the nuclear region of the galaxy is excluded , we find that the ssfr within the h@xmath0 disk is reduced in hi deficient galaxies .",
    "thus gas - depleted galaxies not only have a smaller h@xmath0 disk with increasing hi deficiency , but the ssfr within the star - forming part of the disk is also lower .",
    "however , for approximately half of the gas - poor galaxies , the central ssfr is greatly elevated relative to that in gas - rich spirals .",
    "furthermore , the ssfr in the nucleus relative to the global value in the galaxy _ increases _ with hi deficiency .",
    "these high nuclear ssfrs in partially hi - depleted galaxies point to a transient evolutionary state in which gas is efficiently transported to the central region .",
    "whether the condition is triggered more readily by ram pressure effects , or whether the origin lies with gravitational perturbation , remains to be seen .",
    "we also note the special case of cgcg  059 - 019 , a one - armed spiral with a nuclear ring and bar , in a small galaxy group",
    ". the m=1 patern may be the direct result of a ram pressure wind parallel to the galaxy s disk . finally , since global and local sfrs in spirals are so clearly coupled to hi depletion , and since the sfr ( through h@xmath0 imaging ) and kinematics of star - forming regions can be studied at higher spatial resolution than the hi distribution , h@xmath0 imaging and kinematics provide a particularly powerful probe of the mechanisms driving disk galaxy evolution .",

    "<S> broadband b and r and h@xmath0 images have been obtained with the 4.1-m soar telescope atop cerro pachon , chile for 29 spiral galaxies in the pegasus i galaxy cluster and for 18 spirals in non - cluster environments . </S>",
    "<S> pegasus i is a spiral - rich cluster with a low density intracluster medium and a low galaxy velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> when combined with neutral hydrogen ( hi ) data obtained with the arecibo 305-m radiotelescope , acquired by @xcite and by @xcite , we study the star formation rates in disk galaxies as a function of their hi deficiency . to quantify hi deficiency </S>",
    "<S> , we use the usual logarithmic deficiency parameter , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) is quantified by the logarithmic flux ratio of h@xmath0 flux to r band flux , and thus roughly characterizes the logarithmic sfr per unit stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find a clear correlation between the global sfr per unit stellar mass and @xmath1 , such that the sfr is lower in more hi - deficient galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation appears to extend from the most gas - rich to the most gas - poor galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a correlation between the central sfr per unit mass relative to the global values , in the sense that the more hi - deficient galaxies have a higher _ central _ sfr per unit mass relative to their _ global _ sfr values than do gas - rich galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , approximately half of the hi - depleted galaxies have highly elevated ssfrs in their central regions , indicative of a transient evolutionary state . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a correlation between gas - depletion and the size of the h@xmath0 disk ( relative to the r band disk ) ; hi - poor galaxies have truncated disks . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , aside from the elevated central ssfr in many gas - poor spirals , the ssfr is otherwise lower in the h@xmath0 disks of gas - poor galaxies than in gas - rich spirals . </S>",
    "<S> thus both disk truncation _ and _ lowered ssfr levels within the star - forming part of the disks ( aside from the enhanced nuclear ssfr ) correlate with hi deficiency , and both phenomena are found to contribute equally to the global suppression of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results found in the low richness pegasus i cluster and in non - cluster environments with sfrs found for hi - deficient spirals in the virgo cluster by @xcite . </S>"
