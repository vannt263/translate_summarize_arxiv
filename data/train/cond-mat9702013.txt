    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) exhibit a variety of magnetooptical effects ( giant zeeman splitting , giant faraday rotation etc . ) which allow for the investigation of these materials with both standard magnetometric and optical techniques ( for detailed review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the dms ( cd , mn)te has been studied intensively during the last decades @xcite@xmath0 @xcite , its magnetic properties are determined by the spin @xmath1 of the mn@xmath2ions substituting cd ",
    "ions randomly on the geometrically frustrated fcc lattice .",
    "excitons are prominent quasiparticles in this material and probe locally the magnetic state of the system . under suitable conditions they align the surroundig manganese spins and turn into polarons .",
    "the properties of these new excitations are determined by a variety of sample parameters like quality and structure of barrier surfaces . however , in all probes with sufficiently high manganese content ( or at temperatures below 1 k ) the disorder induced spin glass ( sg ) phase must be taken into account .",
    "we focus on this aspect of polaronic dms physics .",
    "the magnetically active manganese ions are coupled via an antiferromagnetic interaction whose strength falls off rapidly with distance ( the next ",
    "nearest neighbor ( nnn ) coupling is one order smaller than the nearest ",
    "neighbor ( nn ) interaction , which equals @xmath3",
    "@xcite ) . by increasing the manganese concentration , clusters of magnetically coupled mn  ions are formed . at concentrations above 20% a percolating mn  cluster emerges , exhibiting a transition into a spin glass phase at low ( helium ) temperatures , which is caused by the combination of geometric frustration and site randomness .",
    "the sg phase is characterised by the order parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the observation time , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote spins at identical sites and at times @xmath8 and @xmath5 , and brackets represent the thermodynamic average . in zero field @xmath9 is zero in the paramagnetic phase and assumes a nonzero value in the spin glass phase @xcite . +",
    "experimentally the sg phase transition has been observed by a cusp in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and by the onset of irreversibility in the field cooled and zero field cooled measurements of the remanent magnetisation ( for reviews see refs . ) .",
    "the explicit use of spin glass equations for fitting experimental data of the magnetic polaron energy is however new and a key point of the present work .",
    "the manganese ions interact strongly with electronic states in the valence and conduction bands . in magnetic fields",
    "this leads to the giant zeeman splitting of the band states , which extends up to tenths of mev . in the absence of an external magnetic field the formation of the magnetic polaron ( mp ) state  a carrier with a cloud of magnetically polarised mn spins which has a lowered energy ",
    "becomes possible .",
    "the dominant contribution to this energy gain comes from the exchange interaction of manganese spins with the hole  spin .",
    "magnetic polarons were investigated in detail for the case of carriers bound to a shallow impurity ( for review see ref.@xcite ) and for excitons localised by compositional fluctuations @xcite .",
    "since the properties of the magnetic polaron are strongly influenced by the magnetic state of the system , one can expect that the formation of the spin glass phase should affect the properties of this quasiparticle .",
    "the onset of sg order should show up for example in the temperature dependence of the mp energy .",
    "the aim of the present work is to analyse theoretically the effects related to the interaction between the magnetic polaron and sg order , proving that sg effects are specific , hence distinguishable from any kind of antiferromagnetic clustering effects , and indeed required to explain qualitatively and quantitatively the new experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectheo ] a model which accounts for the interaction between spin glass and magnetic polaron",
    "is presented and selfconsistent equations are derived for this model .",
    "an analytical analysis of these equations is presented in section [ secanalyt ] followed by detailed numerical evaluations and a comparison of the theoretical results with the experimental data in section [ secnum ] .",
    "finally in section [ secdyn ] an extended model , which takes into account dynamical aspects of magnetic polaron formation in the presence of spin glass order is presented .",
    "in this paper we consider the magnetic part of the mp energy , which is directly influenced by the sg ordering of the mn spin system .",
    "the exchange energy can also lead to the shrinking of the wave function of the polaron , thus contributing indirectly to the change of the kinetic energy of the mp .",
    "this contribution will be neglected throughout this paper .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of the hole dominates the exchange energy of mp in ( cd , mn)te . for simplicity we account for the hole contribution only , neglecting the small part of the exchange energy gained via coupling between electron and spin glass .",
    "these assumptions are surely justified for localised excitons .",
    "we adopt here the villain model of ising pseudospins . in ref.@xcite detailed arguments",
    "were given in favor of this model and its applicability to ( cd , mn)te .",
    "the lower critical dimension for its ising sg transition being smaller than three together with the fact that the dzyaloshinskii  moriya interaction , which would also turn the heisenberg into an ising sg ( provided this coupling is isotropic itself",
    "; anisotropy would lead to special universality classes @xcite ) , is too small , supports the above model description . in the model considered here",
    "each pseudospin belongs to a tetrahedron with mn spins on the corners . due to the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction between the mn spins the tetrahedron",
    "is frustrated and its ground states can be characterised by a mixed product @xmath10 of three neighboring spins which can assume only two opposite values .",
    "the normalised value of this product @xmath11 can be @xmath12 or @xmath13 and is hence considered as an ising pseudospin .",
    "the interaction between hole and mn  spins will be described by the following model .",
    "consider a percolating cluster with @xmath14 pseudospins in ( cd , mn)te with random frustrated interaction between the spins leading to spin glass order at low temperatures .",
    "we assume the interaction between ising pseudospins to be of infinite range .",
    "the hole spin of the exciton interacts with a part of @xmath15 pseudospins of the entire spin cluster . in this way",
    "the finite range of this exchange coupling is taken into account .",
    "we represent this kondo  like coupling by @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denote the effective exchange constant , @xmath20-component of the hole spin , and the ising pseudospin at site @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the `` exchange box''model is assumed , i.e. the wave function of the hole is constant inside the magnetic polaron and zero outside @xcite .",
    "our assumption implies @xmath22 inside the polaron and zero outside .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath23 the term @xmath24 describes the random interaction between spins of the spin glass with gaussian  distributed random @xmath25 of width @xmath26 and the convention that @xmath27 counts pairs @xmath28 only once and only with @xmath29 .    to investigate the physical effects which result from this model we express the partition function employing the replica",
    "trick , perform the configuration average over the frustrated spin couplings , and after the decoupling procedure by use of the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation obtain the saddle point equations for the model ( for the detailed description of this technique see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the partition function of the model is thus obtained as @xmath30 ,   \\label{statsum}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 denotes the gaussian distribution of couplings , the superscripts @xmath33 relate to replicas .",
    "here and in what follows the superscript @xmath20 will be dropped for the hole ",
    "spin @xmath34 .",
    "the kondo - term @xmath35 is decoupled with the help of the identity @xmath36 the spin glass term in the exponent of the partition function is identical to the hamiltonian of the wellknown sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model ( see ) .",
    "thus the decoupling of this term is completely equivalent to that of the sk model .",
    "the whole decoupling procedure transforms the partition function into @xmath37 , \\end{aligned}\\]][zdec ] where the fields @xmath38 facilitate the decoupling of the kondo  like interaction , while the field @xmath39 does the job for the spin glass interaction .",
    "now we define the replica  symmetric and spatially homogeneous saddle point ansatz for the decoupling fields by @xmath40[sprmp ]    for the fields @xmath39 , replica  diagonal and replica  offdiagonal components are distinguished in general . the replica ",
    "offdiagonal components are related to the sg order parameter , whereas the replica diagonal components are noncritical for the ising spin glass model @xcite .",

    "anderson order parameters inside and outside the polaron respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 represents the thermodynamically averaged spin of the hole and @xmath53 denotes the average magnetisation in the polaron . the equations ( [ p])([q ] ) describe the whole phase diagram of the model in the static mean field approximation . from the qualitative analysis of these equations three characteristic temperature ranges can be identified .",
    "+ ( i ) at high temperatures @xmath54 the equations have only trivial solutions .",
    "the system is paramagnetic and thermal fluctuations suppress the magnetic polaron formation .",
    "+ ( ii ) at @xmath55 the magnetic polaron is formed but the mn system remains in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "+ ( iii ) at @xmath56 the sg order is expected to show up in the mn system .",
    "hence the value @xmath57 determines the temperature of the mp formation . in the experiments",
    "the mp is formed in the paramagnetic temperature regime , which implies the inequality @xmath58 .",
    "here we examine the dependence of the sg order parameter @xmath9 and of the cluster magnetisation @xmath45 on @xmath59 , where @xmath26 corresponds to the transition temperature of an independent sg model . the main difference between the present case described by equation ( [ q ] ) and the analogous equation for the independent spin glass @xcite",
    "is caused by the presence of the exchange field @xmath60 which the localised hole exerts on the pseudospin .",
    "it is worth noting that the influence of the exchange field on the magnetisation in the polaron and on the sg order parameter @xmath9 is analogous to the influence of an external magnetic field localized in the volume of the magnetic polaron ( see eqs.([m ] ) and ( [ q ] ) ) .",
    "the nonzero magnetic field competes with the exchange interaction between mn spins and destroys partially their ordering .",
    "this results in the smearing of the phase transition and lowering of the ( smeared ) transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the transition should still show up in a change of the temperature behavior of the magnetization @xmath45 and of the sg order parameter @xmath9 . in order to see these expected changes",
    "we analyse the temperature behavior of the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath9 in the vicinity of the point @xmath61 .",
    "the case when the polaron constitutes a fixed part of the mn spin system is considered , i.e. @xmath62 fixed , @xmath63 .",
    "we expand the right  hand sides of eqs.([m ] ) , ( [ q ] ) for small @xmath9 up to quadratic terms .",
    "after integration over the random field @xmath20 the equation for @xmath9 becomes @xmath64[critq ] where @xmath65 .",

    "@xmath74 the dependence @xmath75 is linear both above and below @xmath76 , but one observes different slopes in the paramagnetic phase and in the sg phase .",
    "similar behavior is observed in the magnetisation @xmath45 .",
    "we find @xmath77 the linear dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath78 becomes very weak below @xmath76 , i.e. in the sg phase .",
    "the solutions of the saddle point equations describe also the smearing of the otherwise sharp phase transition as caused by the finite exchange field in the magnetic polaron .",
    "the smearing is efficient around the point @xmath79 within the temperature interval given by @xmath80 . beyond this interval the power law behavior of @xmath45 and @xmath9 characteristic of the transition in the pure spin glass",
    "is retrieved .",
    "in order to obtain a detailed description of the physical behavior we solved the saddle - point equations ( [ p])([q ] ) numerically . it is convenient to define a composite sg order parameter according to @xmath81 , where @xmath82[q1 ] @xmath83 describe spin glass order inside ( @xmath84 ) and outside ( @xmath85 ) the magnetic polaron , respectively . + a qualitative understanding of the coupled selfconsistent solutions involving polarisation @xmath44 , magnetisation @xmath45 , and the sg order parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 can be obtained as follows .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] displays the magnetisation , which is determined from eq.([m ] ) , and the sg order parameters .",
    "the thermal behavior of @xmath45 and @xmath84 is strongly affected by the coupling @xmath86 which controls the interaction energy of a pseudospin with the hole  spin . for a large value @xmath87 ( curve 1 in fig.[fig1 ] )",
    "the magnetisation @xmath45 decreases monotonuously with temperature and the phase transition appears strongly smeared by a large exchange field ( which keeps @xmath84 at high values due to non spin glass contributions and thus inhibits its critical decay at the zero field freezing temperature ) . at smaller @xmath88 ( curve 2 in fig.[fig1 ] ) instead",
    ", @xmath89 displays a maximum near the almost sharp sg transition signalled by the rather steep decay of both sg order parameters @xmath84 , within the mp , and @xmath85 .",
    "this is in accordance with the analytical solution given in eq.([mt ] ) .",
    "for fixed temperature , @xmath45 and @xmath84 grow monotonuously with @xmath90 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the average hole ",
    "spin @xmath44 at two different values of the interaction energy @xmath17 between hole  spin and pseudospins within the mp is shown in fig.[figp - t ] .",
    "the change of @xmath17 affects the thermal behavior of the polarisation @xmath91 in a similarly strong way as a @xmath90variation alters the magnetisation @xmath89 . in turn , the spin glass order parameter @xmath85 outside the magnetic polaron depends very weakly both on @xmath17 and @xmath90 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows that with increasing @xmath90 the temperature dependence of @xmath84 , which resembles the @xmath85curve for small @xmath90 ( almost sharp sg transition ) , changes over and approaches the magnetisation curve @xmath89 in the large @xmath90regime .",
    "the total number @xmath14 of pseudospins enters in all formulae only in the form @xmath15 . since",
    ", additionally , the distinction between magnetic order inside the mp and the one within the remaining spin glass domain ( not exposed to the exchange field ) will influence the quantitative agreement between theory and experiment , it is convenient to analyse thermal properties as a function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 . @xmath92 together with @xmath17 determines the exchange energy @xmath90 on a pseudospin .",
    "changing @xmath92 , at fixed @xmath17 and @xmath93 , is thus equivalent to tuning @xmath90 , which was defined in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the parameter @xmath93 determines the relative extension of the polaron and enters in the sg order parameter via the relation @xmath81 .",
    "large values of @xmath93 correspond to a strong influence of the polaronic exchange field on the spin glass order because @xmath93 is the weight of the @xmath84contribution to the composite sg order parameter @xmath9 . as @xmath93 decreases ,",
    "the peak @xmath89 shifts to higher temperatures and becomes more pronounced ( see fig.[figalpha ] ) .",
    "measurements of the magnetic - field - induced circular polarisation degree of exciton luminescence ( reflecting the magnetic susceptibility @xcite ) and of the magnetic polaron energy ( determined by selective excitation of localised excitons @xcite ) against temperature are displayed in fig.[figmpe ] .",
    "the polarisation degree shows a cusp at @xmath94 characteristic of the spin glass phase transition .",
    "the cusp temperature coincides with the sg transition temperature , which was obtained for this manganese concentration by other measurements ( see ref . ) .",
    "the experiments on the temperature dependent emp energy ( solid circles in fig.[figmpe ] ) do not show any peculiarity at the spin glass transition temperature @xmath95 .",
    "however , a plateau is observed at lower temperatures .",
    "we argue that this plateau results from the onset of sg order inside the polaron .",
    "the plateau extends over a temperature range lying below the cusp temperature of the zero field spin glass , because of the large exchange field inside the mp .    in order to determine the parameters of our model we fitted the experimentally known temperature dependence of the exciton magnetic polaron ( emp ) energy in a cd@xmath96mn@xmath97te epilayer .",
    "the exchange part of this energy is calculated according to @xmath98 we fix the value of @xmath99 ( the cusp temperature in the circular polarisation data ) whereas the effective exchange interaction @xmath17 between a hole spin and pseudospins ( tetrahedrae of mn spins ) in the polaron is chosen as a fit parameter .",
    "we also vary the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath93 to obtain maximal agreement of the calculation with the experimental points . the best fit , given by the solid line in fig.[figmpe ] ,",
    "is obtained with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , which is already in a rather good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this justifies our assumption that the magnetic contribution to the emp energy dominates thermal variations and is hence responsible for the main features of its temperature dependence .",
    "the numerical calculations indicate that for these parameters the hole spin is completely polarised , which means @xmath103 for all temperatures under consideration .",
    "thus the temperature dependence of the emp  energy reflects the polarisation degree of the mn spins in the region of the excitonic wave function . calculating the exchange field ( @xmath104 ) in the polaron we obtain a value of about 4.7 t , which is in reasonable agreement with the value 5.9 t obtained by other experimental techniques @xcite . if we take into account that @xmath14 is the number of",
    "_ pseudo_spins representing tetrahedrae of mn spins , we can as well estimate the number of mn spins inside the polaron to be about 60 , which is roughly a factor of 2 smaller than the value estimated from experiment .    despite the rather good agreement between experiment and the model description discussed so far , there are two reasons why the present situation is not yet completely satisfactory",
    ". on one hand , @xmath100 corresponds to a polaron extending through the whole spin glass , on the other , it is known that , besides the percolating spin glass cluster , there exist small clusters of antiferromagnetically coupled manganese spins .",
    "it turned out that these two problems are connected , since an extended model containing bulk spin glass order _ and _ clusters of a small number of antiferro  coupled mn spins allows to describe the experimental data with a more realistic value of @xmath93 .",
    "we model the temperature dependent polarisation of the small mn  spin clusters by use of the wellknown modified brillouin function @xcite commonly used to fit the experiments on zeeman splitting of excitons in ( cd , mn)te @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath105 here the effective spin @xmath106 and the effective temperature @xmath107 reflect the antiferromagnetic coupling of mn  spins ( see ref.@xcite ) ; @xmath108 stands for the manganese concentration , and @xmath109 denotes the bohr magneton . in the argument of the brillouin function",
    "we insert instead of an external magnetic field the exchange field @xmath110 between hole spin and mn  spins in the mp .",
    "for the manganese concentration of 33% the exchange field is @xmath111 @xcite .    the magnetic part of the emp energy is now given as the sum of the contribution originating in spin glass order and a second term representing the effect of small clusters ; the total magnetic emp energy then becomes @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the number of spins within small clusters in the mp .",
    "the exchange constant @xmath114 is known from experiment @xcite .",
    "we fitted the experimental data with the form ( [ energy2 ] ) .",
    "now , in addition to @xmath17 , @xmath93 and @xmath92 , we face three fit parameters more .",
    "these are the number of spins in small clusters @xmath113 and the parameters of the modified brillouin function @xmath115 and @xmath107 .",
    "the aim of our procedure is now to prove that + i ) it is possible to fit experimental data with allowance for the additional presence of small clusters , keeping all parameter values within the physically meaningful regime , together with + ii ) the plateau in the temperature dependence as a genuine effect of the spin glass .",
    "this plateau can not be obtained selfconsistently from the model of clusters of antiferromagnetically coupled spins only .",
    "the fitting procedure is illustrated by fig.[figfit ] .    as mentioned above the searched for function @xmath116",
    "is determined by the temperature dependences of the magnetisations @xmath45 and @xmath117 because the hole ",
    "spin is completely polarised in the entire temperature region under consideration .    for bulk  like real systems",
    "one expects a nonzero portion of the spin glass cluster to be out of reach of the exciton wavefunction , hence outside the polaron .",
    "therefore the real physical situation corresponds to @xmath118 .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 defines the relative contribution of the sg and of small clusters to the emp energy .",
    "the lack of experimental information on the precise value of @xmath93 and @xmath119 forced us to analyse fits with different values of @xmath93 for the interval from 0.3 up to 0.7 and for @xmath119 of order 1 .",
    "the results for the fits were remarkably insensitive to the variation of @xmath93 at least within this regime . in the fit presented in figs.[figmpe ] ( dash - dotted line ) and [ figfit ] ( solid line ) we fix @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which we consider to be a good choice for the real system under consideration . while these relations were not rigorously dictated from experiment , the insensitivity of the fits with respect to variations of these two parameters over a wide range guarantees that the fit , given for the above choice , will describe the real system .",
    "having chosen @xmath93 and @xmath119 , we are left effectively with four fit parameters , @xmath17 , @xmath92 , @xmath115 , and @xmath107 , which remain to be determined . in the following",
    "we define the four relations employed here to determine these parameters unambiguously .",
    "the first three of these conditions are the principal experimental features , which need to be reproduced by the fit curve : + i ) the absolute plateau ",
    "height at low temperatures ( @xmath122 ) , + ii ) the high temperature end of the plateau ( plateau  ridge ) at @xmath123 , and + iii ) the decay of the magnetic emp energy at higher temperatures , as seen in the experiment way above the spin glass freezing .",
    "+ the fourth condition is concluded from the following consideration : the plateau ridge is strongly connected with the position of the peak caused by the sg contribution ( dashed line in fig.[figfit ] ) , which itself is determined by the value @xmath124 . keeping the position of the peak as close as possible to the plateau ridge , condition",
    "iv ) results and we obtain a single value @xmath90 for each @xmath17 ; hence the parameter @xmath92 is now completely determined by the value of @xmath17 .",
    "the matching of the plateau s high temperature end with the experimental data is achieved by tuning the form of the contribution of small clusters ( by means of the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath115 ) for each @xmath17 .",
    "this requirement provides a relation between @xmath17 , @xmath115 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the absolute value of the plateau is defined by the parameters @xmath115 and @xmath17 , whilst the role of @xmath107 and @xmath92 is negligible .",
    "thus the absolute plateau height of the energy curve yields a relation between @xmath17 and @xmath115 .",
    "finally the form of the decay at high temperatures as seen in the experiments provides one more relation between the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath115 , @xmath107 , and @xmath92 .",
    "fig.[figfit ] shows the form of the sg contribution ( dashed line ) and that of the small cluster contribution ( dashed - dotted line ) to the emp energy together with the resulting combined curve of the temperature dependence ( solid line ) .",
    "note that the form of the small cluster contribution is concave .",
    "it follows that the plateau results from the sg contribution to the emp energy .",
    "one can try to fit the same experimental data with the modified brillouin function alone .",
    "however , in this case one should take the parameters obtained from the zeeman splitting fit in cd@xmath96mn@xmath97te , since now the brillouin function describes the whole spin system and not only the part of small clusters as above .",
    "if one does so , the brillouin fit does not coincide with the experimental data .",
    "agreement can only be achieved by using brillouin function fit ",
    "parameters very different from those obtained by the zeeman splitting . for this reason",
    "such a procedure does not result in a consistent description of the complex magnetic behavior of ( cd , mn)te .    in conclusion ,",
    "the fit described above shows that the main qualitative feature , which is the plateau in the temperature dependence of the emp energy , is the specific result of the spin glass order in the polaron .",
    "the plateau occurs at a temperature lower than the bulk sg transition temperature because of the high exchange field in the polaron .",
    "in this section we suggest a phenomenological model for the dynamics of the mp formation .",
    "the approach presented here aims at taking into account the contribution of the sg - phase .",
    "thus we do not consider the nonmagnetic contributions to the mp formation ( prelocalisation ) , the shrinking of the hole ",
    "wavefunction during mp  formation and the microscopic mechanisms of the spin and energy relaxation ( a description of these subjects is given in ref . ) .",
    "we suppose the changes of the averaged spin of the hole and the magnetisation in the polaron to be slow in time in comparison with the thermodynamic fluctuations so that , at each instant of time , we can define the state of the system by thermodynamically averaged quantities ( magnetisation , average hole ",
    "spin etc . ) .",
    "then the formation of the mp can be considered as an evolution of mp parameters @xmath45 and @xmath44 in time from zero values at @xmath125 which is the trivial solution of the static mean field equations ( [ p ] and [ m ] ) towards the nontrivial static solutions at @xmath126 .",
    "this evolution is governed by an additional dynamical part .",

    "dependent @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the definition of @xmath9 as edwards - anderson order parameter .",
    "the equilibration time for @xmath9 is of order @xmath133  the characteristic time of thermodynamic relaxation processes at this temperature . for the suggested model",
    "this time is shorter than the characteristic evolution time of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the dynamics of the mp formation is described by the solution of equations ( [ pdyn ] ) , ( [ mdyn ] ) , ( [ q ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath134 .",

    "is nonzero only due to the exchange field of the mp .",
    "the relevant values of @xmath20 in the integral of eq.([mdyn ] ) lie in the region @xmath136 .",
